  "body": "I\u2019m getting a bit sick of all this \u201cantisemitism is convulsing/dragging down/wrecking Labour\u201d. No it isn\u2019t, but bang on about it enough, and it will. What a pity racism isn\u2019t dragging down the Conservatives, after all their rubbish about Kenyan Obama, piccaninnies, swarms of migrants and years of trying their best to make us all fear and detest foreigners, even toddler ones. Their voting against Alf Dubs\u2019s bill to let in 3,000 lone refugee children makes you want to lie down and cry for ever. How thrilled they must be that silly Ken has dredged up Hitler again and gone blundering into the Haavara agreement. I long for him to shut up. He ought to know, having been in politics for such a long time, that Israel, Zionism and the Jewish people are subjects you shouldn\u2019t touch with a bargepole, unless you\u2019ve got something sensible and accurate to say. People get very hot under the collar about it, as poor Nicky Campbell found out on Sunday\u2019s The Big Questions. He could barely keep a lid on things. I once bumped into a fellow who used to attend my mother\u2019s synagogue. He mentioned Israel, and I said I\u2019d just written about it, which sent him into a blind panic. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t do that!\u201d he roared, without a clue what I\u2019d written. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t write about that!\u201d So I said goodbye, sharpish. And I was going to keep shtum about this latest anti-Zionist = antisemitic business, but I can\u2019t, because I\u2019ve never read such a gigantic load of rubbish about the Labour party, and it\u2019s blotting out our other problems: housing, inequality, offshore accounts, the NHS, refugees. But perhaps that\u2019s the point. All right, the far left are not all paragons of virtue, but Labour is not \u201crife\u201d with antisemitism or packed with \u201cdirty old [Stalinist] men\u201d. It has always been, and still is, anti-racist. And so is Jeremy Corbyn, my MP. And so am I, but I do not like a lot of what the Israeli government is doing, particularly the continuing illegal occupation of Palestine. If I can\u2019t say that without being told off for being antisemitic, then the world has gone mad.",
