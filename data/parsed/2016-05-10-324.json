Ducks and wading birds swim about or sleep on the banks of mud in the fine morning rain. Pete Hughes, a former warden here at RSPB Pulborough Brooks, and now warden at the nearby reserve at Medmerry, greets me: \u201cThe stilts are in the left-hand pool, towards the front.\u201d  Nothing else looks like the black-winged stilts. Ten slender black and white birds are wading through the water, their red, stick-like legs folding and unfolding delicately as they dip their long, needle-like beaks in the water. Only one is fully adult \u2013 a male \u2013 the rest are probably just over one year old. Two years ago, two black-winged stilts had bred at Medmerry. They were part of an unusual influx that year, with several pairs across southern England attempting to breed. The Medmerry pair raised three young \u2013 the first stilts to fledge in the UK since 1987. \u201cWhen I heard that there were 10 \u2013 ten! \u2013 here,\u201d laughs Hughes, \u201cI knew I\u2019d have to have a look!\u201d Is this another one-off, or the start of a colonisation by the species?    Related: Flight of the goshawk    \u201cThe appearance of the stilts might be down to successful breeding attempts in 2014,\u201d he explains, \u201cor drought in southern Spain, or just an expanding population in northern Europe \u2026 or all three. It\u2019s expected that the recent increase in breeding attempts in southern England will lead to an established breeding population. We\u2019re most likely witnessing the colonisation of the UK, just as we saw with little egrets during the 1990s. \u201cMost of the group appear to be young birds, meaning they are unlikely to breed this year, but it\u2019s a splendid sight, and another step in the stilt\u2019s UK story.\u201d  Nobody expects the stilts to stay \u2013 they will probably move on when the weather clears. A nightingale\u2019s pure song carries from the undergrowth and the rain stops. The next day the weather has lifted and, as expected, the stilts have flown away to find somewhere else to spend the summer. Follow Country diary on Twitter: @gdncountrydiary",
