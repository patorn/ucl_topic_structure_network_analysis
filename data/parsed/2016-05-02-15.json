Related: Somali refugee in critical condition after setting herself alight on Nauru    Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Q&A program on Monday night, Megalogenis said Papua New Guinea\u2019s decision to close Manus Island detention centre after its supreme court ruled it illegal, coupled with recent tragedies on Nauru, had made the issue difficult to ignore. \u201cManus Island is clearly not functional at the moment but the government thinks: \u2018If we bring them onshore we\u2019ve lost a debate and we\u2019ll lose the election\u2019,\u201d Megalogenis said. \u201cMalcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten would rather talk about anything else. They don\u2019t want to see boats coming in the middle of an election campaign.\u201d But Megalogenis said reports of the growing mental health crisis in Australia\u2019s offshore detention centres could force either the Coalition or Labor to act. A 21-year-old Somalian woman set herself alight in Nauru detention centre on Monday, three days after an Iranian refugee, a 23-year-old man named Omid, died from burns sustained when he set himself alight on Nauru on Wednesday. The woman, named Hodan, was taken to Nauru hospital with severe burns on Monday night.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many boats come or don\u2019t, if one person a week is setting themselves alight in an election campaign, sooner or later is going to target our consciousness that we\u2019re holding hostage hundreds of people because we can\u2019t sort this out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in the long run the world, when it pays attention to Australia, wants to see a good citizen \u2026 and when we start playing other games, trying to be the nastiest country in the region \u2013 out Trump-ing Trump before Trump had even been invented in terms of asylum seeker policy \u2013 I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before our luck runs out.\u201d    #QandA One day a future PM will have to hang her (or his) head and officially apologise for off shore processing.\u2014 Jane Caro (@JaneCaro) May 2, 2016      Manus + Nauru are the definition of out of sight, out of mind attitude to a global crisis, and how Australia deals with its cruelty #qanda\u2014 Travis Lucas (@travislucas91) May 2, 2016    Megalogenis made the comment in response to a question from Lauren Malanos, who asked why Malcolm Turnbull had refused New Zealand\u2019s offer to take the Manus Island detainees.  \u201cPeople do not seek asylum because a people smuggler convinced them through effective marketing \u2026 When can we stop purposefully denying existing refugees their futures simply to use them as a deterrent and help them, as is every developed country\u2019s duty?\u201d Malanos said. The panel included Megalogenis; Australian Financial Review political editor Laura Tingle; American writer and journalist James Fallows; the NSW assistant minister for health, Pru Goward; and Iain Walker, the executive director of the newDemocracy Foundation. Fallows, a national correspondent with the Atlantic, said Australia\u2019s approach to asylum seekers had damaged its international reputation. \u201cAustralia does not look good at the moment with this policy, on either side of the debate, but no-one looks good [on the refugee issue] right now,\u201d he said.  Goward, asked whether she thought Australia should accept New Zealand\u2019s offer to take the Manus refugees, said it was \u201cnot an issue, I have to say, I have followed very closely\u201d and that she had \u201cno opinion\u201d.     Since when has a politician not had an opinion? #QandA\u2014 Alex Kilroy (@AlexKilroy18) May 2, 2016      Goward saying she doesn't follow the NZ/refugee issue shows a great 'let them eat cake' type of attitude, and pride in ignorance. #qanda\u2014 Amy Feldtmann (@AmyFeldtmann) May 2, 2016    Turnbull is expected to call an election this week after the budget is handed down on Tuesday. Tingle said the resulting race would be between a man who believed himself born to be prime minister, but was not very good at politics, and a \u201cstreet fighter\u201d in Bill Shorten.   Related: Turnbull rejects New Zealand offer to take 150 refugees from detention    \u201cThis campaign will either see him [Turnbull] turn into a PM who can lead, who can communicate, because it will just snap into place, or he\u2019s going to spontaneously combust like the drummer from Spinal Tap,\u201d she said. Tingle said that coming up against a one-term government meant the Labor party had \u201cabsolutely nothing to lose\u201d and was prepared to take risks, which differentiated this election from the past six years of conservative politics. But Walker, whose organisation runs \u201ccitizen juries\u201d to provide policy alternatives to local and state governments, said the Australian political system was not designed for deep election-time policy discussions. \u201cWe have built a system that responds really well to slogans ... We\u2019ve built a system based on voting for the person you hate less,\u201d he said.",
