  "body": "Manuel Pellegrini believes he has several more years as an elite manager and is confident there will be attractive offers for his services after leaving Manchester City. Pellegrini leaves the club in the close season after three years to be replaced by Pep Guardiola. Yet despite turning 63 in September \u2013 and City being the 11th club of a 28-year management career \u2013 Pellegrini is hungry to continue at the highest level.

I\u2019m sure I can be a top manager for a lot more years. I\u2019m not tired. I don\u2019t suffer with the pressure, I like it. I like it because it [drives you on] much more every day.\u201d Managing another Premier League club is Pellegrini\u2019s preference. \u201cIf I continue in England with a team that has a project which is competitive, it is a very important option. If I have to go to another important league in Europe with an important project with a big team, also of course it is an option. I have [a further] option maybe not in Europe but that I must decide with other things.\u201d Pellegrini effects a low-key public persona but denies this means he can be underrated. \u201cNo, because when I finished with M\u00e1laga [in 2013] I had three or four options, the best teams in Europe. When I finish at Manchester City, I have important options. Also at Real Madrid [in 2010],\u201d he said. Pellegrini also revealed he has previously been offered the chance to manage top Premier League clubs: \u201cI had important options some years ago from Liverpool and before that I had options from Chelsea and Man City, before these owners,\u201d he said. In his three seasons at City Pellegrini has won the Premier League and the Capital One Cup twice, most recently in February. He also took City into the Champions League knockout stage for a first time. In Pellegrini\u2019s first two campaigns they were knocked out by Barcelona in the last 16. This season they reached the semi-finals, losing Wednesday night\u2019s second leg 1-0 at Real Madrid to be eliminated by the same score. Pellegrini believes this run to the final four of the European Cup is his finest achievement this year as it has broken a psychological barrier for the club. He said: \u201cIt was very important. This season was my last one and it was important to demonstrate that we could do better and we really did it better. We played in a very good tactical way against Real Madrid. They scored just one. I didn\u2019t expect that we were not going to attack because we didn\u2019t change our mentality. We tried to press. I\u2019m sure that in the next years they will have the last step.

If you are not going to qualify for next season\u2019s Champions [League] I don\u2019t think the fans are going to be very happy. Everyone wants to win the Champions League because it\u2019s a special competition but the domestic game motivates a lot more. But if you ask me, yes my best thing this season was not to win the Capital One it was to arrive to the semi-final.\u201d Neither Pellegrini\u2019s side nor Arsenal, their opponents in Sunday\u2019s late kick-off, are yet guaranteed a Champions League berth. Arsenal are in third place on 67 points, City fourth on 64 and Manchester United close behind in fifth on 63 after their win at Norwich on Saturday. Arsenal won the reverse fixture 2-1 and last season drew 2-2 at the Emirates and beat City 2-0 at the Etihad. Pellegrini believes Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s team adopts a more negative, long-ball game against his side. \u201cLast year they came here in another style of play. Longer passing and more direct. And more players in defence,\u201d he said. When the season finishes Pellegrini will spend time exploring these shores. \u201cWhen I live in a country I always try to learn about the country \u2013 not just England, the UK as a whole so I will stay here some days to do something different. I would like to visit a lot of cities in Scotland, Ireland [and] the south of England.\u201d",
