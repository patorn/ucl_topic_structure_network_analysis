Martin, returning to his origins in science fiction magazines with an interview with Galaxy\u2019s Edge, told writer Joy Ward that \u201ca writer, even a fantasy writer, has an obligation to tell the truth and the truth is, as we say in Game of Thrones, all men must die\u201d.    You don\u2019t get to live forever just because you are a cute kid or the hero\u2019s best friend or the hero  George RR Martin     \u201cWe\u2019ve all read this story a million times when a bunch of heroes set out on adventure and it\u2019s the hero and his best friend and his girlfriend and they go through amazing hair-raising adventures and none of them die. The only ones who die are extras,\u201d said Martin. \u201cThat\u2019s such a cheat. It doesn\u2019t happen that way. They go into battle and their best friend dies or they get horribly wounded. They lose their leg or death comes at them unexpectedly.\u201d If a writer is going to be honest, said Martin, they have to write about death, especially if they\u2019re telling a story about war or conflict. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve accepted that you have to include death, then you should be honest \u2026 and indicate it can strike down anybody at any time. You don\u2019t get to live forever just because you are a cute kid or the hero\u2019s best friend or the hero. Sometimes the hero dies, at least in my books,\u201d said Martin. \u201cI love all my characters so it\u2019s always hard to kill them but I know it has to be done. I tend to think I don\u2019t kill them. The other characters kill \u2019em. I shift off all blame from myself.\u201d The latest issue of the bi-monthly free online magazine Galaxy\u2019s Edge also features Martin\u2019s story Fast Friends, set in a universe where \u201cEarth was teeming, civilised, dull; time and technology had homogenised it\u201d, and \u201cwhat romance there was left was all in space.  \u201cThousands lived under the domes of Luna now. On Mars, terraforming projects were in full swing, and new immigrants flooded Lowelltown and Bradbury and Burroughs City every day. There was a lab on Mercury, toehold colonies on Ceres, Ganymede, Titan,\u201d writes Martin in a story about travel to the stars which was first published in the 1970s. The author told Ward about how he started out publishing stories in fanzines, eventually having his story The Hero published in Galaxy Magazine in 1971, for a fee of $94 (\u00a364). \u201cI remember when it came out in February 1971. I was with my friends scouring all of Chicago to look for copies of it. Buying two copies at this news stand and two more at that news stand and oh, this doesn\u2019t have it, and carrying it home. They didn\u2019t send you authors\u2019 copies in those days. You had to go out and hunt it down yourself,\u201d Martin told Ward. \u201cIt was pretty exciting. Your first time is always pretty exciting, whether it\u2019s publishing or sex. And you always remember it. Opening that envelope and seeing that cheque in there. It was pretty amazing seeing it on the news stand, seeing my name in print.\u201d Martin went on to publish stories in science fiction and fantasy magazines throughout the 1970s, completing his first novel, Dying of the Light, in 1977. Today he is, according to Galaxy\u2019s Edge, \u201cunquestionably the best-selling SF and fantasy writer of all time, and quite possibly the bestselling writer in the world the past few years\u201d.

Will I still write them?\u2019 And if the answer is \u2018yes\u2019, then you\u2019re a writer,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you have to be a writer. It\u2019s the only thing you can do. If the answer is \u2018No, I\u2019m going to quit after a few years because I\u2019m not selling\u2019, then maybe you should quit right now and learn computer science. I hear there\u2019s a real future in these computer things.\u201d           Game of Thrones season 6 trailer",
