  "body": "Sadiq Khan has offered support to the proposed garden bridge in London on condition that the trust behind the controversial \u00a3175m project agree to a list of demands. The mayor of London said the Thames footbridge must be a genuinely public and open space as he told the Garden Bridge Trust (GBT) that its plans must be amended.  Among his demands is a reduction in the number of days the crossing is shut to the public for private fundraising events from the planned 12. But Khan, who was elected on 5 May with 1.3m votes, appears to be already facing a struggle with the GBT, which did not immediately agree to all his demands.  Khan said the garden bridge could rival New York\u2019s high line, a public park built on a 1.45-mile elevated former railway. \u201cBut it must be a genuinely public and open space for all Londoners, rather than a closed and private space,\u201d he added. Khan also wants the bridge, designed by Thomas Heatherwick, the architect behind the Olympic cauldron and new Routemaster London bus, to be closed for fewer hours when fundraising events are held. It is currently planned to close for 24 hours at a time.  The mayor also wants a guarantee that children at local schools on either side of the river will get to visit the garden bridge and be involved in planting and maintenance. He also wants the GBT to work with all of London\u2019s parks so that seeds and plants grown on the bridge can be replanted across the capital.           Sadiq Khan makes his debut LBC appearance as mayor of London    A GBT spokesman welcomed the mayor\u2019s support but insisted it would be necessary to shut the bridge on some occasions to raise funds for its estimated \u00a32m a year running costs. \u201cWe welcome the mayor\u2019s support and look forward to working with him and his team to make the beautiful garden bridge happen and deliver its many benefits to millions of Londoners and visitors to the city,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe share the mayor\u2019s desire to have the bridge open to everyone for as long as possible. Balancing this and the need to raise the required private funds to operate the bridge is important. \u201cWe also share the mayor\u2019s desire to involve young people. We already have a youth board made up of over 40 local students, who will be taking an active role in developing our education and schools programme.  \u201cWe are also progressing partnerships with local green initiatives and charities and look forward to developing these further and building on the mayor and the trust\u2019s shared aspirations.\u201d The plan has proved hugely controversial, especially the use of \u00a360m in public money to part-finance the scheme, which will remain private land, closed overnight and for occasional corporate events, and subject to dozens of rules, enforced by \u201chosts\u201d. The remainder of the money is being raised from donations.  Khan criticised the previous City Hall administration under Boris Johnson and published the previously undisclosed full business plan for the project. \u201cThe early days of this project clearly fell short of our expectations on transparency,\u201d Khan said. \u201cI am determined to run the most open and transparent administration London has ever seen. I will let the sunshine in, which is why we are today publishing the previously undisclosed full business plan for the garden bridge alongside a list of its funders.\u201d Khan appeared on his first \u201cSpeak to Sadiq\u201d call-in show on LBC radio with presenter James O\u2019Brien. One caller, named only as Michael, asked if he could stop more public money going into the garden bridge project.

Ask Joanna Lumley    \u201cWhat I\u2019m keen to secure is no more of London\u2019s taxpayers\u2019 money that I\u2019m responsible for is spent on the project,\u201d Khan replied. \u201cWhat I think is really important is that I try to negotiate the best that I can for Londoners. \u201cI can\u2019t now undo the money spent by the previous mayor, almost \u00a340m spent of taxpayers\u2019 money, I can\u2019t undo that. What I can do is make sure the money I\u2019m responsible for, no more is spent on the garden bridge.\u201d The business plan released by Khan shows that \u00a3143m has been raised so far towards the estimated \u00a3175m project, leaving a gap of about \u00a350m. The documents show the bridge has received \u00a360m in public funds, which includes \u00a330m from the Treasury and \u00a330m from Transport for London. However, TfL is expected to get \u00a320m of its money back. More than \u00a333m was donated by companies, including \u00a35m from Sky and \u00a32m from Citigroup, another \u00a338m from trusts and foundations, including \u00a320m from the Sainsbury family\u2019s Monument Trust, and \u00a311m from individuals.",
