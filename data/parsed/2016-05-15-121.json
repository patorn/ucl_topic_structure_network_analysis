  "body": "British photographer Celine Marchbank has described her new book as a \u201cdelicate\u201d project. The word is well chosen. Marchbank is a quiet observer of the everyday and here she applies her steadfastly low-key, almost diaristic approach to an immensely difficult subject: the last year of her mother\u2019s life.    The camera allowed me just a couple of split seconds a day to record the things that would go on to mean so much    The subtitle of the book is My Mother\u2019s Favourite Flower, and the narrative is punctuated by images of flowers in bloom outdoors and in vases by her mother\u2019s bedside. Their complex symbolism is suggested throughout: life, death, the transience of things and people, the natural beauty of the everyday that we often take for granted until it is rendered luminous by the sudden, dislocating awareness of our own mortality. In September 2009, Marchbank\u2019s mother, Sue Miles, was diagnosed with stage four cancer. Marchbank immediately began photographing her mother and \u201cthe things that reminded me of her, or things I wanted to remember of her\u201d. In April the following year, her mother\u2019s illness was confirmed as terminal and the memory project took on an even more delicate aspect. \u201cThat is when it became really difficult,\u201d writes Marchbank in her foreword; \u201cafter all, I was her daughter, not her photographer.\u201d Still, she continued, though fraught with doubt about what it was exactly that she was doing \u2013 \u201cwhy had I introduced a camera to this dreadful situation?\u201d A few lines later, she answers that question: \u201cThe camera allowed me just a couple of split seconds a day to record the things that\u00a0would go on to mean so much to me, the little things that would be\u00a0gone.\u201d     \u2018A steadfastly low-key approach to an immensely difficult subject\u2019... from Tulip by Celine Marchbank. Photograph: Celine Marchbank    Tulip is not, as Marchbank points out, a record of her mother\u2019s death. It\u00a0is more an inventory of the quotidian\u00a0details that can define even\u00a0the most painful situations, but are soon forgotten when we finally emerge from the strange hinterland we\u00a0enter when attending someone who is seriously ill. That heightened but hazy place is evoked throughout in quiet imagery \u2013 light falling on a medication chart, raindrops on a windowpane, her mother\u2019s sewing box \u2013 but also in portraits of her mother as her illness takes its toll. It is a determinedly honest evocation of a terrible time.   Related: Sue Miles obituary    The narrative shifts in tone again towards the end with a landscape of grey sky above a thicket of trees. \u201cLooking out of her bedroom window, I realised this is the start of the first day of my life without her,\u201d reads the\u00a0caption. A few pages later, a snapshot of the Guardian obituary page reveals that her mum was, among other things, a \u201cdoyenne of counterculture and the restaurant revolution\u201d. One life contains many lives. The penultimate image is a wilfully blurred still life of wilting flowers in a vase, and the final one a black and white portrait of her mother, young and alive, cradling her newborn daughter in her arms, while chatting on the phone. It seems a fitting conclusion to this singular collaboration. Tulip is published by Dewi Lewis (\u00a335).",
