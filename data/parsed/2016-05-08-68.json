  "body": "This riveting draw takes Manchester City\u2019s bid to qualify for the Champions League out of their hands and gives that advantage to Manchester United. The numbing disappointment of this was evident at the end as the home support rapidly left and Khaldoon al\u2011Mubarak, the chairman, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano, stood stony faced. It also meant that when Manuel Pellegrini and his players re-emerged 15 minutes later the Chilean endured the embarrassment of giving a farewell speech to a near-empty Etihad Stadium.

Instead, a breathless end-to-end affair closed with the Sky Blues on 65 points and Arsenal 68 with next Sunday\u2019s final games to go. If West Ham are beaten, United will lift themselves to 66 points and become favourites to edge out their cross-town rivals for fourth place. Towards the end, the usually lethal Sergio Ag\u00fcero steered a left-foot volley wide and later Pellegrini threw on Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Wilfried Bony \u2013 who hit the bar three minutes from the close \u2013 but it was to no avail. City had required only eight minutes to take the lead and two to let it slip. They pressed the visitors back as Kevin De\u00a0Bruyne took an opening corner from the left, then the first free-kick from the same channel. Each of these yielded nothing but when play switched to the right this changed. Jes\u00fas Navas was one of four players in City\u2019s XI who survived from Pellegrini\u2019s opening home game in August 2013 \u2013 a 4-0 defeat of Newcastle United \u2013 along with Joe Hart, Fernandinho and Ag\u00fcero. The Spaniard is maligned for lacking devilry but the scooped ball to Fernandinho to turn Arsenal\u2019s defence belied this. From here the Brazilian headed down and back towards Ag\u00fcero. The Argentinian made a mug of Mohamed Elneny with a touch that created the chance and his left foot did the rest, beating Petr Cech for a 24th Premier League strike this season. It was precisely the start City wanted. Yet within seconds they ceded the advantage and could only blame themselves. The corner from which Olivier Giroud would beat Hart was a gift, after Clichy decided to head a cross back to the goalkeeper only to wrong-foot him and come close to registering an own goal, the ball going wide to the right. From the ensuing kick City compounded this sloppiness by failing to mark Giroud. The Frenchman\u2019s header past Hart was convincing but the nearest to City player to him, Fernando, only reacted afterwards: in anger, perhaps at himself. After the game it was confirmed that Vincent Kompany\u2019s thigh problem will ensure he misses Belgium\u2019s 2016 European Championship campaign and the start of the Pep Guardiola era. Twenty-one minutes in Danny Welbeck suffered his own injury. The striker went down after trying to tackle Bacary Sagna, and having sustained a suspected lateral meniscus problem of his right knee his availability for England at Euro 2016 is now under threat, too. What the No23 left behind was an entertaining if uneven match as each side struggled to establish any rhythm.

Cech came hurtling out but his challenge left him on the floor and, with Ag\u00fcero still in possession, Arsenal were fortunate the score remained even. The second half began as a listless affair until De Bruyne took charge. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn will not wish to see video analysis of how he allowed the Belgian to outmuscle him near halfway. From here De Bruyne still had work to do, and he did it \u2013 leaving Beller\u00edn trailing as he drove at a back-pedalling Arsenal, cut inside and banged a right-foot finish past Cech, inside the right post. This had Pellegrini and the Sky Blue faithful roaring. It stunned the visitors and wrestled the initiative City\u2019s way. However, Arsenal came back to enjoy a period of dominance and they came close to equalising via Theo Walcott. A 59th-minute replacement for Alex Iwobi, the England player got in behind but a clumsy touch meant the ball ran away from him. Then, Arsenal did score. Nacho Monreal was involved along the left before Alexis S\u00e1nchez took over. He fashioned a slick one-two with Giroud and let fly a shot that beat Hart for his 13th league goal this season. Beforehand Pellegrini was thanked by the owner, Sheikh Mansour. Writing in the programme, Al-Mubarak said: \u201cManuel has [won] two domestic trophies, a memorable Premier League title, and our best finish to date in Europe\u2019s premier competition. Significantly, he has ensured these achievements have been reached by attacking, entertaining football. Our club will always be grateful.\u201d The emotion may seriously dampen if City finish only in fifth. This would also mean Guardiola managing a club in the Europa League for the first time in his glittering career.",
