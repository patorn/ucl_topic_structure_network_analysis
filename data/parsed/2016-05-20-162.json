Headed up by a Georgian collective of designers and based in Paris, its status as the label of the moment is as bewildering as its success. How did a mishmash of grungy florals, \u00a31,000 tracksuits and the infamous DHL T-shirt become the Parisian catwalk look?     Vetements autumn/winter 2015 show. Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock    Dig deeper, though, and you will see a whole raft of designers coming from the former Soviet bloc, such as Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tigran Avetisyan and Outlaw, a collective of avant-garde creatives founded by Maksim Bashkaev and Di Minrakhmanova, popping up in Vogue. These designers all focus on the same three looks: oversized, grungy and super-casual sportswear. On one level, it\u2019s streetwear. Or, as Katerina Zolototrubova, fashion editor of Vogue Russia, calls it: gopnik \u2013 a tricky and pejorative term describing \u201cthe bad boys from suburbs\u201d in Russia. Not dissimilar to the loosely defined ladwear of London, \u201cit\u2019s the style of 90s kid\u201d. \u201cOn one hand, it is kind of nostalgic, as we had very specific fashion time when we just started to get clothes from abroad, trying to adjust it to reality and everyday life,\u201d she says.     Gosha Rubchinskiy spring/summer 2016.    Lumping eastern European, Georgian and Russian designers together isn\u2019t always useful or accurate, given the political differences between the former Soviet countries, but their shared inspiration in this kind of streetwear is fast becoming 2016\u2019s biggest look. Think primary-coloured tracksuits, buckets hats, oversized fake leather jackets and flat caps. Lithuanian fashion expert Ieva Zu, who runs Fashion Bloc (a site dedicated to fashion from eastern Europe), agrees there is a eastern European movement \u2013 be it wearing a rope as a belt or brandishing a politically charged badge or logo \u2013 but that its success now feels random: \u201cThat these designers are famous now is sort of coincidental, even lucky. It\u2019s become one of the main looks of the season, or the moment, but the look is actually based on something we grew up with back home.\u201d Influenced by punk, skateboarding and Russian history, Russian designer Rubchinskiy creates bold streetwear in peppy colours sometimes marked with the hammer and sickle, in reference to the USSR. She isn\u2019t alone in finding fashion\u2019s fetishisation of this symbolism uncomfortable: \u201cI understand it has a sense of humour here. But for someone like me it\u2019s not the irony of the style which is difficult.\u201d Zu was seven when the Soviet Union collapsed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wear it simply because of what I experienced during that period,\u201d she explains. \u201cI understand that fashion can be politically provocative, and I think if you have no association with it, it\u2019s your choice. But would I wear it back home? No.\u201d     Gosha Rubchinskiy\u2019s spring-summer 2016 show. Photograph: Sipa/Rex Shutterstock    Still, even without the pre-Soviet references, it marks an interesting flip in the way streetwear has shifted geographically. \u201cGrowing up, we were wearing this sort of thing, but what we wanted to wear was American style from the 1990s,\u201d explains Zu. The leap from extreme streetwear to catwalk has become commonplace in fashion, especially since Balenciaga installed Demna Gvasalia as its new creative director. That look has come to define Parisian menswear as neither formal nor casual. Zolototrubova adds: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we produce more than other countries, but maybe at the moment everybody pays attention to the eastern bloc because of Gosha and Vetements.\u201d",
