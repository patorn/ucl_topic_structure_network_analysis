  "body": "The NBA\u2019s perpetual underdogs finally saw the best season in franchise history come to an end on Friday night, as the Toronto Raptors fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers 113-87 in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. With the win, the Cavaliers reached their second consecutive NBA finals.   Related: Golden State Warriors strike back with crucial Game 5 win over Oklahoma City    And while it wasn\u2019t quite the dismantling that was seen in Game 5 (a 116-78 Cavaliers win) the Cavs will enter the finals with confidence, having handed the Raptors only their third home court postseason loss in 11 games at the Air Canada Centre. The home faithful rarely fell quiet, hoping for a miracle after the Game 5 drubbing. Raptors fans, who have made the ACC one of the more difficult buildings to play in for visiting teams, were treated to an ugly first half. A series of questionable calls slowed the pace of the game to a crawl and the referees threatened to become the storyline as 22 fouls were called. Among them was a flagrant foul assigned to Raptors center Bismack Biyombo after an elbow against Kevin Love. It would have ruled Biyombo out of Game 7.         LeBron James speaks.    But Game 7, and the NBA finals for that matter, were not meant to be for the Raptors.  \u201cWe had lapses in the second quarter,\u201d said Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan. \u201cAnd they took advantage of that. You sacrifice so much for moments like this and to have it taken away from you, it\u2019s hurtful.\u201d There are good teams and there are elite teams in the NBA \u2013 Friday night drew a clear line in the sand between the two. \u201cEvery situation [in this year\u2019s playoffs] was new for us,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning experience for our guys. We\u2019re learning. We\u2019re not where they are right now.\u201d While that may be true of the Raptors, a 56-win regular season and a spot in the final four in the NBA is nothing to scoff at. The Raptors have room to grow (and perhaps to add in free agency) but that didn\u2019t mean Casey wasn\u2019t confident about the Raptors\u2019 future.  \u201cWe should be proud,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re not satisfied.\u201d The postmortem will soon begin. Kyle Lowry recently became just the third Raptor in franchise history to be named to an All-NBA team but many would argue that the lack of an elite supporting cast is still a glaring hole. The Cavaliers coach, Tyronn Lue, addressed how important this run is to the city of Cleveland. But the Raptors had more of an opportunity to make an impact in their home city. It is a hockey city and may always be, but this Raptors team deserves credit for trying to captivate not just a city but an entire country.  An identity was built late in the season. Whether they build off that or go in a different direction with free agent signings will be one of the biggest questions of the offseason.         LeBron James in action.    \u201cI think we\u2019re a step ahead in the process,\u201d said Casey. \u201cWe\u2019re still a relatively young team to talk about competing for a championship. We still have a ways to go.\u201d And just as there are good and elite teams, there is LeBron James.  James was a force, shrugging off persistent boos from the rowdy home crowd to lead the Cavaliers scorers with 33 points, including going 3-6 from three-point range and shooting 59.1% from the field.  \u201cI think he has a chance in this league,\u201d Casey joked.  Lue said before the evening\u2019s events that \u201cthis is our Game 7\u201d and as to be expected, James responded. His performance was no joke as he slowly broke down the Raptors defense, continually finding open lanes. \u201cWe needed LeBron to set the tempo for us early,\u201d said Lue, adding: \u201cWe knew he was going to run out of gas.\u201d That spoke to how much the incredible supporting cast of Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving contributed to Game 6.  Entering his sixth straight NBA Finals, it doesn\u2019t appear as if James or the Cavaliers are going to run out of gas any time soon.  \u201cEven that 30 seconds I took LeBron out in the first half, he got mad about that,\u201d Lue said of James\u2019 first half performance, in which he logged 23:23 minutes. \u201cWe\u2019re not entitled to anything,\u201d said James. \u201cWe earned our right to be here today.\u201d Now they are Eastern Conference champions. The focus will shift to the NBA finals.  \u201cWe\u2019re still OK,\u201d said James. \u201cWe\u2019re not great yet.\u201d The Raptors will have to wait for another crack at a first ever NBA finals. \u201cWe the North!\u201d the crowd chanted emphatically as the final seconds ticked off.  \u201cThese fans mean a lot to the team,\u201d said James.  One team marches forward while another must look inwards. Still, despite the loss in Game 6, you have to believe that the Toronto Raptors have finally shed the underdog tag once and for all.",
