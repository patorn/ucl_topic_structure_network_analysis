  "body": "Nick Blackwell has described the Eubanks as \u201cdisgusting and inhuman\u201d because they ignored his request not to speak publicly while he remained in a coma. The 25-year-old was forced to retire after suffering a swelling on the brain during his defeat to Chris Eubank Jr in March. Blackwell had previously insisted there were \u201cno hard feelings\u201d towards his opponent and his father, who were hoping to visit him in hospital. However, in his first interview since retiring, Blackwell admitted that he was disappointed that they spoke out before he had been given the all-clear.

It\u2019s inhuman, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he told The Sun. \u201cThey were trying to make themselves look like the good guys when they are the opposite.\u201d Blackwell added: \u201cMy family and friends were begging them not to talk, but they ignored it. I\u2019ve only just been shown the press conference and I know exactly what happened. It isn\u2019t human what they\u2019ve done. They were grabbing as much attention as they could. I was still in a coma but they went ahead and did it. That\u2019s the Eubanks, isn\u2019t it? They just want attention, no matter if it\u2019s a bad or a good thing.\u201d The Sun article also claimed that Blackwell had said: \u201cIf I could have one more knockout shot, I\u2019d love to land it on the jaw of Chris Eubank,\u201d although he later denied that comment on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. \u201cI can\u2019t actually remember saying that,\u201d he said.

My family begged them not to do it and they went to do it.\u201d Eubank Jnr stopped Blackwell in the 10th round after Eubank Snr had advised his son to avoid aiming for the head and instead concentrate his efforts on the body at the end of the eighth round at Wembley Arena. The 49-year-old was praised for his actions at the time, but Blackwell said: \u201cThe people who saved my life were the referee, the person who put me in the coma and the people at St Mary\u2019s Hospital. The Eubanks didn\u2019t save my life. \u201cChris Jnr was asked later if he\u2019d pick the belt or my health. He refused to answer. I\u2019m not being funny, but someone\u2019s health and life is more important. \u201cThe night of the fight he went partying. He was celebrating. You\u2019ve won the title, fine, you can go out and celebrate. \u201cI would have wanted to go to the hospital and be by his side until he woke up.\u201d Eubank Jnr defended his actions, saying: \u201cPeople and media demanded that we speak to them. If we had just said \u2018No comment\u2019 it would have come off as cold.\u201d The 26-year-old told The Sun: \u201cIf Nick is part of the small percentage that took offence, that\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s sad for me to hear something like that. \u201cAll I have ever wanted for Nick has been the best. The fight was all the publicity that was needed. It was a great British tussle and such a shame it ended like that. Anything that happened after that was not for our gain. \u201cPeople deserve our side of the story and our perspective on things \u2013 that\u2019s all it was.\u201d",
