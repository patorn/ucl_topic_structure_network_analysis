  "body": "Aside from the facial hair and the petrol-guzzling international airline, one thing Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson is known for is his passion for fighting climate change. \u201cWe need every person on Earth to acknowledge that climate change is real, and encourage each other and our leaders to address the challenge,\u201d wrote billionaire Branson last year.  So with this in mind, some listeners might find it odd to hear on the latest official Virgin podcast that human-caused climate change is not a fact agreed upon by every credible science academy on the planet, but is instead \u201cessentially a bankrupt theory.\u201d These were the words of James Delingpole, the British polemicist, climate science denialist and guest of Dominic Frisby, the writer, comedian and Virgin podcast host. In a knockabout 20-minute segment full of laughs and japes, Virgin podcast listeners can hear how volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide than humans, that global warming stopped 18 years ago and how wind turbines are \u201cbat chomping eco-crucifixes\u201d (Frisby especially liked that one).  Let\u2019s quickly look at a couple of these claims.  Leading climate scientist Dr Ben Santer, of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, told me the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen 40% since the start of the industrial revolution. Only 1% of that increase is due to volcanoes, compared to roughly three-quarters caused by burning fossil fuels.  \u201cMr Delingpole\u2019s statement is clearly incorrect,\u201d he said. The US Geological Survey says humans emit about 100 times more carbon dioxide than volcanoes.  Global warming stopped 18 years ago?  Neither Delingpole nor Frisby mentioned that 14 of the 16 hottest years on record, according to Nasa, have all occurred since the year 2000. In one embarrassing gaffe after another, Delingpole trotted out well-worn climate science denial talking points while Frisby confessed to being \u201cconfused\u201d.  At one point, Frisby said \u201cthe UK has actually been getting colder\u201d \u2013 a statement based on how, when he was a student in the 90s, \u201cwe always had amazing summers.\u201d  According to the UK Met Office, eight of the 10 warmest years in the UK have happened since the year 2002. What about those warm summers in the 90s?  While the \u201camazing\u201d summers of 1995 and 1997 were warm, they were not as warm as 2003 or 2006, according to Met Office data. \u201cSurely some countries have got hotter,\u201d asks Frisby, apparently seriously, to which Delingpole replies: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think they have.\u201d  Really? 2015 was the warmest year for the continents of Asia and South America and the second warmest for Africa and Europe. Those continents may contain \u201csome countries\u201d.  In introducing Delingpole, Frisby pointed out his Virgin bosses had agreed to have him on as a guest, knowing his fringe views were not shared by the corporation. This was a credit to Virgin, Frisby said.  Delingpole\u2019s appearance was \u201cin the interests of balance\u201d, Frisby told listeners. Previous guests had included three outspoken advocates of climate change action, Tim Flannery, Jeremy Leggett and former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed.  In a long response to questions, Frisby said he had invited Delingpole after some listeners asked for a guest \u201cto air the other side of the debate.\u201d A Virgin Group spokesperson said featuring Delingpole was \u201cneither an endorsement of, nor an agreement with, his positions\u201d and, like Frisby, pointed out the names of three other guests who had been vocal on climate action.  Clearly, when several studies have found that more than 90% of actual climate experts agree humans are causing climate change, the idea that there are \u201ctwo sides\u201d which need to be balanced is either na\u00efve or reckless \u2011 possibly both.  I asked Frisby if it was incumbent for a host of a podcast bearing the Virgin brand to \u201cavail themselves of a few facts\u201d when discussing a crucial issue (and one on which Virgin itself is vocal).  \u201cThe problem with availing myself of facts is that this argument is now so politicised it is difficult to know what is fact and what is dogma,\u201d said Frisby. \u201cAnd many are so aggressive in the way they argue the case it actually has an alienating effect of the undecided, less knowledgeable neutrals like me. Hence my decision to speak to people in person and learn that way.\u201d  Inviting a consistently wrong non-expert who once wrote that the \u201cclimate alarmist industry\u201d should answer questions in the \u201cdefendant\u2019s dock in a court of law, before a judge wearing a black cap [worn by UK judges when handing out death sentences]\u201d hardly seems like a safe route to inclusiveness. Oh \u2013 I almost forgot to mention the Virgin podcast tag line. \u201cGrown up conversations with interesting people.\u201d  Read Frisby\u2019s full response here",
