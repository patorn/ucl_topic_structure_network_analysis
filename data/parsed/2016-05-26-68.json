Related: Sam Adams and Paul Revere's time capsule opened in Boston, 220 years later    Developer Skanska found the wreck last week while digging on 121 Seaport Boulevard, about a quarter of a mile from the waters of Boston harbor. The company contacted a local archaeology firm, which brought the wreck to the city\u2019s attention. Archaeologists raced to excavate before construction begins again. The 50ft ship \u201clooks like it\u2019s a mid- to late-19th-century sloop\u201d, city archaeologist Joe Bagley told the Guardian. \u201cIt held what appeared to be a lot of barrels full of lime, with a few barrels still intact.\u201d The boat also seemed to have suffered fire damage, he said.  \u201cEverything\u2019s kind of been burned,\u201d Bagley said, \u201cwhich happens to lime boats because the lime can get exothermic reactions to water, ironically.\u201d Despite the explosive properties of lime, humans have used it in construction since at least the time of ancient Rome. In the 19th century it was also used for agriculture and making paper.  The Boston sloop was probably a cargo vessel, Bagley said, and may have traveled down from Maine, where New Englanders dug quarries for lime, which was shipped to ports along the east coast. The ship may have simply run aground. In the 19th century, what is now a financial hub of modern Boston was a tidal mudflat linked to the harbor. At high tide the area was underwater, but at low tide a ship would be vulnerable to run or drift aground. Bostonians may have tried to burn the boat to a smaller size, in order to get it out of the way of other ships.  Archaeologists are working on a cross-section of the ship, which will give them a de facto blueprint and help them trace what happened to it.

In the last two decades developers have filled the edge of the harbor with caverns of skyscrapers.  Bagley said archaeologists were working as quickly as possible to dig out and rescue artifacts from the ship, and that a team from across the Charles river in Cambridge will perform a 3D scan of the wreck, as they did for a Palmyran arch that was recreated in London and will be shown in New York in September. This is not the first shipwreck found under Boston\u2019s dry land: the city found a smaller, partial wreck while working on its massive \u201cBig Dig\u201d highway tunnel. But the new wreck is the largest land addition to the many wrecks underneath Boston harbor, some of which retain pieces of the port\u2019s history: artifacts of slave trading, shipments of wine, trade from Europe \u2013 \u201cYou name it,\u201d Bagley said. Last year, Boston archaeologists opened a time capsule that was unearthed by construction work on the city State House. They found it had been placed there by two revolutionary war heroes, Sam Adams and Paul Revere, and that it contained coins and partisan newspapers of the era.
