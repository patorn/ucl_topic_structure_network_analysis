  "body": "In a low-lit studio near Oval Tube station in south London, filming for the new series of Channel 4\u2019s short-film strand Random Acts is under way. On the face of things, it seems like a professional operation: the set is sparsely decorated and stylish, the short films on the monitors by Martin Creed, the Chapman brothers and others, are by turns weird and affecting. But something seems to be wrong with the show\u2019s presenter Eric Wareheim, a tall, bearded man wearing an ill-fitting blazer. He keeps garbling his lines, facing the wrong direction and arguing with the director, all while the cameras are rolling. He\u2019s frankly a mess, but then that\u2019s sort of the point.

But if you do, you\u2019ll know that amateurish is his USP. Over the past decade he has cornered the market in a style of anti-comedy that revels in stilted performances, notably with his writing and performing partner Tim Heidecker. Together they have created a series of shows for late-night TV network Adult Swim that grotesquely mimic the uncomfortable nature of US public access television, the cable service where anyone can broadcast their own, usually shambling, shows. All of this work, from hallucinogenic sketch comedy Tim And Eric\u2019s Awesome Show, Great Job! to their disturbing anthology series Bedtime Stories \u2013 currently airing over here on Fox \u2013 is concerned with unsettling their audience as much as amusing them. Or, as Wareheim puts it, \u201cI try to do everything just a bit off.\u201d            So what on earth is a bizarro US comic doing presenting an arts programme in the UK? There\u2019s actually a skewed logic to handing Wareheim the gig. Random Acts has always dealt in the playful side of art, a world away from Andrew Graham-Dixon sighing at Monets on BBC4, so a piss-takey host feels on brand. \u201cIt\u2019s an irreverent look at an arts programme,\u201d Wareheim explains. \u201cWe\u2019re making fun of it. A lot of time I\u2019ll be yelling to the director: \u2018Turn down these lights, I\u2019m sweating all the\u2026 Hi, I\u2019m Eric Wareheim, welcome to the show.\u2019\u201d Melvyn Bragg can rest easy for the time being.   Related: Best TV of 2015: No 6 \u2013 Master of None    Although his primary work has been the screwball comedy he creates with Heidecker, in recent years Wareheim has started branching out. He has contributed a film to Random Acts, and is working on his first virtual reality production set in New Orleans\u2019 bounce music scene. He has also become a regular on the music video circuit, directing predictably weird promos for Charli XCX and Major Lazer. Most recently, there was Wareheim and Aziz Ansari\u2019s unofficial vid for Kanye West\u2019s Famous, in which the rapper credited himself with Taylor Swift\u2019s fame. Filmed in the restaurants and piazzas of Rome, the video set the track\u2019s braggadocio against a goofy depiction of middle-aged male bonding, which Ye later endorsed himself.  Wareheim and Ansari bashed out the video while plotting season two of Master Of None, Ansari\u2019s comedy of millennial ennui, which is partly set in Italy. Wareheim jokingly dismisses this prep session as an excuse to dick about \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re just going to hang out and rent scooters\u201d \u2013 though that sells the show short: its first season felt groundbreaking in both form and content, putting south-east Asian and Indian-American voices front and centre at a time when so much of TV and film feels almost exclusively white.

He jokes about being the show\u2019s \u201ctoken white friend\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m really proud to be a part of it,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe show\u2019s telling stories to the mainstream that haven\u2019t been told. Of course, I have gay friends and Asian friends, but for your average Netflix watcher, they\u2019re like: \u2018Woah, this is heavy.\u2019\u201d I mention that my favourite scenes in the series are between Dev and his mum and dad, played by Ansari\u2019s actual parents with an endearing stiltedness. In another world you could imagine them appearing in one of Tim and Eric\u2019s grotesque works. The pair have always used non-actors to ramp up the sense of the unpolished oddness in their comedies, notably with David Liebe Hart, an outsider artist who sings about alien abductions using a host of moth-eared animal puppets.  At the other end of the scale is John C Reilly. The actor is a frequent collaborator, appearing as Dr Steve Brule, a bizarrely coiffed simpleton who has landed a job as a TV presenter, despite being barely able to stand up straight. It\u2019s a remarkable performance, with Brule seeming even more amateurish than the actual amateurs used by Tim and Eric.  Ultimately, capturing people\u2019s unvarnished strangeness is what unites all of Wareheim\u2019s work. \u201cWe are obsessed with real awkwardness,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhenever you see someone on camera sweating, looking around, Tim and I always loved that. You can go from David Liebe Hart, to John C Reilly to Tim and I in a weird outfit. They\u2019re all the same people. There\u2019s never a straight man. We\u2019re all a little fucked up.\u201d Random Acts is on Mondays, 12.05am, Channel 4",
