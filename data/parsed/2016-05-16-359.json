Chairman Mao\u2019s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution \u2013 a decade-long period of political and social turmoil \u2013 began exactly 50 years ago on Monday.   Related: The Cultural Revolution: all you need to know about China's political convulsion    On 16 May 1966 a Communist party document fired the opening salvo of the catastrophic mobilisation warning that counter-revolutionary schemers were conspiring to replace the party with a \u201cdictatorship of the bourgeoisie\u201d. What followed was an unprecedented period of upheaval, bloodshed and economic stagnation that only ended with Mao\u2019s death, in September 1976. However, on Monday newspapers in mainland China were bereft of any coverage of the Cultural Revolution\u2019s anniversary.  The party-run Global Times tabloid completely ignored the event leading instead with a story about Beijing\u2019s anger over a Pentagon report detailing its land reclamation activities in the South China Sea. Stories about Donald Trump and Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of the EU with Hitler both found their way into the pages of the Beijing Morning Post but there was not a single mention of Mao Zedong or his mass mobilisation.  The Beijing Times also shunned the anniversary dedicating its front page to a story about police efforts to find missing children.  No official memorial events were reported by China\u2019s heavily controlled media and Chinese academics were forbidden from talking about the sensitive period.  \u201cResearchers cannot accept any interviews related to the Cultural Revolution,\u201d one scholar told Canada\u2019s The Globe and Mail. \u201cThey think that if we expose the Cultural Revolution\u2019s dark side people will doubt the political system,\u201d Wang Youqin, author of Victims of the Cultural Revolution, a three-decade investigation into Red Guard killings, told the Guardian.  Roderick MacFarquhar, a Cultural Revolution expert at Harvard University, said president Xi Jinping would be wary of anyone attempting to use Monday\u2019s anniversary \u201cto bring up uncomfortable facts\u201d about the party\u2019s past.

He loved the idea of civil war \u2026 The last thing Xi Jinping wants to do is raise anything to do with the Cultural Revolution because it inevitably affects Mao\u2019s reputation.\u201d Only in Hong Kong, which is part of China but enjoys far greater political freedoms thanks to a deal governing its return to Chinese control in 1997, was the media able to mark the painful anniversary. An opinion piece published in the South China Morning Post said: \u201cFifty years on, and the party has failed to bring any kind of justice to address the traumatic event. \u201cIf the party fears disclosing the truth about its own past and refuses to learn from it, how can it have a clear vision of the right direction for the future?\u201d it added.

Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images    Half a century after the Cultural Revolution kicked off with an explosion of Red Guard violence in Beijing, academics are still debating the period\u2019s impact on contemporary China. Daniel Leese, a Cultural Revolution expert from Freiburg University who is researching the legacies of the Mao era, said one consequence was the fixation of Chinese leaders with political stability. \u201cFrom the view of the party it is very clear that one of the main legacies is that you should never let go of control, you should always maintain the commanding heights, there shouldn\u2019t be factionalism at all within the party,\u201d he said. For today\u2019s leaders it was still paramount that \u201cthe 10 years shouldn\u2019t appear as a period of complete anarchy because, after all, the party was still at the helm,\u201d Leese added. MacFarquhar, the author of Mao\u2019s Last Revolution, said half-a-century on the role of ordinary Chinese citizens in the violence had still not been been sufficiently interrogated. \u201cI think that the most terrible aspect of the Cultural Revolution was not just that the chairman threw the whole country into chaos. It was that having fired the starting gun, Chinese became immensely cruel to each other,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if some Nazi boss had said, \u2018Kill these 6,000 Jews\u2019. People just fought each other, killed each other \u2013 especially in the Red Guard factional fights \u2026 It was just a case of letting them off the leash and they did it.\u201d   Related: 'What mistake did we make?' Victims of Cultural Revolution seek answers, 50 years on    Outspoken groups of leftists who view the Cultural Revolution as a golden age of social equality and ideological righteousness have defied Beijing\u2019s attempt to downplay the anniversary.  At one commemorative event in Shanxi province neo-Maoists held up red banners reading: \u201cMao\u2019s thoughts are invincible\u201d and \u201cLong Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!\u201d  At a rally in the northeastern city of Dalian demonstrators brandished portraits of Mao and banners that read: \u201cSailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman.\u201d Zhang Hongliang, a prominent Maoist scholar, claimed critics of the Communist party were manipulating Monday\u2019s anniversary to destabilise China\u2019s current regime.  \u201c[Their purpose] is not only to reject the Cultural Revolution\u2026 they are taking advantage of these 10 years to entirely negate the leadership of the Communist party of China,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it was a wrongful campaign, 40 years is enough time for people to move on.\u201d Wang Youqin, the Cultural Revolution researcher, said such voices should not be allowed to continue their denial of the bloodshed and suffering.  She lamented how, unlike Cambodia, where the Khmer Rouge tribunal has investigated crimes committed under Pol Pot victims of the Cultural Revolution had been denied any historical reckoning. \u201cI am shocked that after 50 years we still don\u2019t have a complete report on the Cultural Revolution. It is a shame.\u201d  The academic said she was convinced that ordinary people could make a difference by remembering and recording the events of that tumultuous decade.  \u201cThings will change,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIf we make the effort, if we tell the truth, people will listen.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
