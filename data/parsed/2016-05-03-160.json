  "body": "Mary Shelley\u2019s hauntingly thrilling novel Frankenstein is a much loved classic horror - and is perceived to be the first sci-fi novel in history!  Whether reading for your studies or reading for pleasure this novel will reside with you long after you have turned the last page; Shelley\u2019s writing style and subtle inclusion of some biographical themes convey a realism to the reader which adds to this novel\u2019s harrowing ambiance. Frankenstein deals with timeless controversial themes and looks at society from multiple points of view, showing to us how much - or little - has changed since the early 1800s. Though ultimately telling the catastrophic tale of Victor Frankenstein and his morbid creation, the novel instils a sense of curiosity about science and how far it can be taken.          Only a couple of hundred pages long, Frankenstein is an easy read - bar the archaic terminology at some points - that will leave you both haunted, inquisitive and wanting to read again.
