  "body": "Winners Neil Hamilton: The cash-for-questions ex-Tory made his comeback with a victory for Ukip in the Welsh assembly elections. In spectacular fashion, Hamilton appeared on Good Morning Britain to reassure voters of his credentials, claiming he was a \u201cthorough-going Welshman\u201d and that if he were cut open he would be \u201clike a stick of Blackpool rock\u201d. \u201cWelsh rock\u201d, his wife Christine jumped in to correct him.   Related: Ignore the doom merchants: Corbyn has shown he\u2019s a viable leader | Gary Younge    Cheap dates: Leanne Wood, leader of Plaid Cymru, snatched Rhondda from Leighton Andrews, making it one of the biggest upsets of the night for Labour. Plaid had been preparing to support Labour over a wideranging and important health bill ... or at least they were, before Andrews jokingly branded the party a \u201ccheap date\u201d \u2013 suggesting its backing was easily won. Copulating pigs: Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, won in the North East Fife constituency, but his election campaign will be remembered for a peculiar moment when two pigs started copulating behind him at the exact same time that he said he wanted to send a pictorial message to voters. It was the pigs wot won it, Rennie!    Looking back over today's Willie Rennie i/v. \"We like to send a pictorial message about what we're asking for.\" pic.twitter.com/oQETx3CBUw\u2014 Philip Sim (@BBCPhilipSim) April 8, 2016    A Tory pile: Duncan Enright, Witney East\u2019s sitting Labour councillor and unsuccessful challenger to David Cameron in last year\u2019s general election took the fight to the Tories, after first losing and then regaining his council seats when a bundle of his votes were found under a pile of Tory ones.     Lost by 70 votes or so. Thanks for the opportunity to serve. The fight goes on\u2014 Duncan Enright (@duncanenright) May 6, 2016      Actually I won! Bundle of my votes under a Tory pile! Delighted! Thanks Witney! https://t.co/zyxsXceOhL\u2014 Duncan Enright (@duncanenright) May 6, 2016    Losers Drunk voters: Four years after the \u201cBradford Spring\u201d, George Galloway, as it stands, received 1% of the London mayor vote, putting him neck-and-neck with the Cannabis is Safer than Alcohol party. \u201cI see George Galloway picked up the \u2018I didn\u2019t know I was voting, I was drunk, I thought I was ordering pizza\u2019 vote,\u201d one Twitter user observed. Boris Johnson: Johnson ended his eight-year mayorship by opening a new cycle superhighway in his final hours, and many cyclists were reportedly there to cheer him, but there was a caveat. \u201cThere were hundreds of cyclists who were really enthusiastic and going \u2018Three cheers\u2019 and all this sort of stuff, and the cameras were running,\u201d Johnson told LBC. \u201cThen this cyclist came up, I was doing my final bit to the camera about how proud I was, and this cyclist came past and went \u2018Prick\u2019.\u201d Ken Livingstone/nazism: The former London mayor made headlines by talking about Hitler. Again. In an interview with Sky News, Livingstone said: \u201cFor a lot of people it\u2019s a shock to discover there had been that relationship between a small section of the Jewish community in Germany and Adolf Hitler.\u201d He later appeared on the BBC, again, defending comments linking Zionism and the Nazis. A social media user reminisced: \u201cRemember when Gerry Adams was banned from speaking on British media?\u201d The honours system: In a curious alignment, the Tory election guru Lynton Crosby was knighted just as the ballot for London mayor was being counted. The Australian politico had been accused of helping run Zac Goldsmith\u2019s dog whistle campaign, which attempted to link Sadiq Khan with Islamic extremists. Posting a picture of Prince Charles knighting Crosby, actor Stephen Mangan wrote: \u201cAnd then he cut off his head, yeah?\u201d Racist videos: Victoria Ayling, Ukip\u2019s \u201csend \u2019em back\u201d candidate for police and crime commissioner, lost to the Tories\u2019 Marc Jones in Lincolnshire, three years after a video emerged of her saying on camera that all immigrants to Britain should be sent back home. \u201c[It could be used for] some future get back at me. Bribery, blackmail \u2013 we need the blackmail music don\u2019t we,\u201d she said in the video. Yep. Scots Nats: Nationalist trolls on Twitter faced a hurdle after the SNP failed to secure an overall majority in Scotland: a blow to the party\u2019s hopes of holding a second independence referendum. What next for the social media warriors?",
