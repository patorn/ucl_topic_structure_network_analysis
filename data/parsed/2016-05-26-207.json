There\u2019s no question that Levental\u2019s debut is out of the ordinary: a postmodern bildungsroman that charts Masha\u2019s transformation from awkward provincial girl to reclusive international arthouse film-maker, all the while tallying up the emotional cost exacted from her along the way. But when he began the novel, he had no idea where his character was heading. \u201cThe first thing for this novel was the melody of the first two sentences,\u201d he says. \u201cThen some girl appeared and I tried to imagine who she was and what was going to happen to her.\u201d     Masha Regina by Vadim Levental. Photograph: Oneworld Publications    Levental is speaking on a telephone from St Petersburg, trying to explain his work through the dual filters of speaking in a second language and a two-second delay. At first, he says, the shape of the novel was unclear to him: \u201cWhen I started to write about her I didn\u2019t understand who this girl was. Then she started to have blood, to have a body and then eventually she became a person with her own character, and this character made the novel.\u201d It was only in the third or fourth chapter that the plan for the novel suddenly appeared. \u201cAt that point I understood the arc of the story \u2013 then it was a question of filling in the details.\u201d Masha\u2019s story launches into this arc in characteristic fashion, when the schoolgirl goes to take her grandmother a jar of bean soup and the old woman dies right in front of her. Masha pours the soup out around the foot of a pear tree in the garden and sets off home, filled with a strange power, \u201cas if her grandmother\u2019s death has given her some sort of gift\u201d. Suddenly a route for an escape to the city opens out in front of her with \u201cthe unity of a complete storyline \u2026 the fullness of a life taking shape\u201d.  The novel telescopes past and future into a single moment, jumping out of straightforward realism to reveal how our choices are constrained by the limited number of roles we can play in the stories of our own lives. The translator, Lisa C Hayden, says she finds Masha Regina hard to describe because it combines so many different things. \u201cIt\u2019s a fictional biography, but it\u2019s so much more than that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a coming-of-age story, it\u2019s a Petersburg novel, it\u2019s got humour and philosophy, it\u2019s got so many things.\u201d For Levental, the ambition the novel displays is a necessary part of the contemporary writer\u2019s toolkit \u2013 a 21st-century novel has to be \u201cmore than just a story of some made-up life\u201d.    When you write, there\u2019s something that goes on with your body \u2013 I can feel the warmth of Masha's body  Vadim Levental     \u201cA hundred-and-fifty years ago it was possible to make a deal with the reader that you would tell them a story, and the reader could sign up to enjoy that story as if it was true,\u201d he explains, \u201cBut these days that kind of deal is impossible, because we have too much nonfiction, too much autobiography, too much great reportage \u2013 why should I read fiction if there\u2019s so much great writing out there that\u2019s actually true? So the writer of fiction needs to make another kind of contract with the reader: \u2018I\u2019m telling you a story and let\u2019s pretend that it\u2019s true, that it was like this.\u2019 That\u2019s a contract the reader can sign up to.\u201d This perspective is interrupted twice, as Levental\u2019s headstrong protagonist suddenly hijacks the narration. \u201cA lot of people \u2013 my agent, my editor \u2013 said: \u2018Why do you need this chapter where she speaks on her own? Maybe you should write it again.\u2019 But I insisted,\u201d he says. Letting Masha grab the microphone wasn\u2019t planned: \u201cIt was like when you\u2019re floating along the river and you can hear the rhythm of the water and it\u2019s very metrical and at some point you reach a waterfall and you\u2019re glad to hear a different beat\u201d. Levental\u2019s prose in Russian is very complex, according to Hayden. \u201cHe mixes registers, he uses some very complicated syntax and there are some very long sentences, where I had to get really creative with the punctuation \u2013 though that\u2019s very common in contemporary Russian literature, there are a lot of long sentences around at the moment,\u201d she says. Masha Regina is filled with allusions to Russian literature and German philosophy, some of which are \u201cfairly opaque for anglophone readers \u2013 but Vadim was always very nice about it, pointing out that Masha didn\u2019t always pick up on them herself.\u201d Born in St Petersburg in 1981, back when the city was still Leningrad, Levental has worked for the last nine years as an editor at the independent publisher Limbus Press. Although he\u2019s always enjoyed cinema and television, even taking small roles in about a dozen films, the writer says he\u2019s never wanted to make a film himself, never felt he really could. There\u2019s too much waiting around on set, he says, and writing fiction is \u201cmuch cheaper\u201d. Levental neither embraces nor rejects comparisons with his protagonist, placing himself somewhere on the continuum between Flaubert\u2019s \u201cMadame Bovary, c\u2019est moi\u201d and Pushkin\u2019s insistence in Onegin that he\u2019s \u201cnot Eugene, we\u2019re different fellows\u201d. Even though he admits he can\u2019t draw at all, the scenes in the novel where Masha sits with heavy hands, a wave of heat rolling over her as she grips her pencil and pulls images out of \u201cthe rectangular paper abyss in front of her\u201d are, in some sense, drawn from life. \u201cWhen you write and you understand that you\u2019re doing the right thing, there\u2019s something that goes on with your body a bit \u2013 like Masha\u2019s heaviness in the arms, or the warmth she feels,\u201d he says. \u201cThe process of achieving something in art is a physical thing.\u201d Levental describes Masha\u2019s powerful and disturbing films at length in the novel; he says he feels like he\u2019s seen them playing in his head. \u201cBut not every shot, every detail. Several people have told me that they\u2019ve read the novel and felt like they\u2019d watched Masha\u2019s movies, and I think that means that in some sense I\u2019ve done the job. These movies don\u2019t exist \u2013 but if I can convince the reader that they\u2019ve seen them then I must be doing something right.\u201d  Masha Regina was first published in Russian in 2012.
