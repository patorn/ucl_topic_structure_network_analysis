Built from scratch in just four years, the city was a symbol of modern, rational, functional planning. \u201cPresident Kubitschek wanted to build a new capital,\u201d architect Oscar Niemeyer said in a BBC interview. \u201cHe wanted a city that would represent Brazil. So I dedicated myself to finding a new solution, something that would attract attention.\u201d Niemeyer, along with the architect L\u00facio Costa, designed the city to look like a bird in flight \u2013 a network of highways in the wings, and the administrative offices in its head. Among political elites, if not all architecture critics, Bras\u00edlia was viewed as a triumph over Brazil\u2019s urban chaos. A thousand miles to the south in the city of Curitiba, capital of the agricultural state of Paran\u00e1, urban planners were hard at work replicating the Bras\u00edlia model. New lanes would be added to Curitiba\u2019s downtown roads, with historic buildings demolished to make room for them. A new viaduct would link with the central square at Rua Quinze de Novembro to ease traffic congestion.  \u201cBut we said no!\u201d exclaims Jaime Lerner. The former mayor of Curitiba is speaking over the phone from his office in Curitiba, where he now directs his eponymous private architecture firm. Back then, Lerner was a recently graduated architecture student, leading a movement against the existing mayor\u2019s vision of a Curitiba for cars. \u201cWe were starting to lose our history, our identity,\u201d he says.     Alden Square in Curitiba. One of Lerner\u2019s first major projects as mayor was to pedestrianise parts of the city. Photograph: Alamy     Over the next two decades \u2013 first as planner, then as mayor \u2013 Lerner would develop a radically different vision for Curitiba: \u201cIt was a change in the conception of the city. Working, moving, living leisure ... we planned for everything together. Most cities in South America separate urban functions \u2013 by income, by age. Curitiba was the first city that, in its first decisions, brought everything together.\u201d  Today, while Bras\u00edlia is viewed as a white elephant city, Curitiba has become the gold standard in sustainable urban planning: variously the \u201cgreen capital\u201d, the \u201cgreenest city on Earth\u201d, and the \u201cmost innovative city in the world\u201d.  \u201cCuritiba is not a paradise,\u201d Lerner insists. \u201cBut it is a model for many cities in the world. Why?\u201d He takes a long, dramatic pause: \u201cBecause in about two decades, a few young professionals made some very important changes.\u201d From chaos to creativity Curitiba is an unlikely setting for such radical innovation. For centuries, the city was little more than an outpost for travellers moving between S\u00e3o Paulo and the surrounding agricultural regions. Curitiba was the \u201csleeping city\u201d, a place where cattle drivers would hibernate in the winter en route to their next destination. When a wave of European immigration hit southern Brazil, Curitiba\u2019s sleepy farmland was an obvious attraction. Germans arrived in the 1830s, Polish and Italians arrived in the 1870s, and Ukrainians two decades later. Each group occupied a section of the city, developing their own local industries and beginning to populate the downtown area with churches, shops and restaurants.     Jaime Lerner was mayor of Curitiba three times. Photograph: Alamy     By the 1940s, however, Curitiba\u2019s growth was impossible to contain. The mechanisation of soybean production pushed Paran\u00e1\u2019s agricultural workers off their land and into the city. Between 1940 and 1960, the city\u2019s population more than doubled \u2013 from 140,000 to 360,000 residents. Curitiba was quickly becoming the archetypal Brazilian mid-size city. Favelas grew around its periphery; cars jammed into its centre. Curitiba\u2019s planners could do little to regulate their city\u2019s chaos. In 1964, following Brazil\u2019s military coup, mayor Ivo Arzua solicited a new masterplan to guide Curitiba toward growth, order, and extra room for the automobile. Over the course of several months, his government held a series of seminars known as \u201cCuritiba of Tomorrow\u201d, seeking to convince the public on the merits of the new masterplan.  \u201cBut as usual, from 1965 to 1970, nothing happened,\u201d says Jonas Rabinovitch, a UN senior adviser and former planner at the Curitiba Research and Urban Planning Institute (IPPUC). Despite Arzua\u2019s best intentions the plan remained in the drawer, and the IPPUC, set up in 1965 to implement this masterplan, remained largely idle. \u201cThe institute was basically colouring paper, producing plans, examining studies,\u201d Rabinovitch says. Lerner and a team of architects at the IPPUC were, however, determined to turn this tide \u2013 \u201cand they started at the exact right time,\u201d according to Rabinovitch. \u201cHad they waited 10 or 15 more years, it could have been too late for Curitiba.\u201d Under the new military regime, Lerner was appointed mayor, and the IPPUC moved into the driving seat: \u201cWhen Jaime became mayor, the plan finally began to transform into a reality,\u201d Rabinovitch says. Lerner\u2019s first project in 1972 earned him an early reputation as an enforcer. He proposed transforming the Rua Quinze de Novembro from an automobile thoroughfare into a pedestrian mall. \u201cAt first, the shopkeepers were furious with the mayor,\u201d Rabinovitch says. \u201cPeople had the habit of stopping their cars in front of the stores, buying what they wanted, and then getting back into their cars. But that meant that when the shops closed down, the city centre was dead.\u201d The shopkeepers organised resistance to the new plan, and resolved to file an injunction to stop it \u2013 a typical tactic for arresting the implementation of urban projects in Brazil.     Curitiba became a model for quality public transport, with policies including the rapid bus transit system. Photograph: Alamy     \u201cEvery time, you always have a big resistance,\u201d Lerner says. \u201cWhen we first proposed the project, we tried to convince the merchants. We showed them designs, information ... it was a big discussion. Then we realised we had to have a demonstration effect.\u201d So Lerner took the plan to his director of public works, saying: \u201cI need this [built] in 48 hours ... He looked at me and asked, \u2018Are you crazy? It will take at least four months.\u2019\u201d    If you want creativity, cut one zero from the budget. If you want sustainability, cut two zeros!  Jaime Lerner     Regardless, Lerner and his team \u2013 impatient, wily or both \u2013 prepared to begin work at sundown that very Friday, waiting only until after the city\u2019s courthouse had closed so that shopkeepers could no longer file their injunction. \u201cIf I\u2019d received a juridical demand to stop the project, we would never have made it,\u201d Lerner recalls. \u201cSo we finished in 72 hours \u2013 Friday night to Monday night. And at the end, one of the merchants who wrote the petition to stop the work told me: \u2018Keep this petition as a souvenir, because now we want the whole street, the whole sector pedestrianised!\u2019\u201d The project encapsulates Lerner\u2019s planning philosophy: act now, adjust later. \u201cWe had to work fast to avoid our own bureaucracy, and to avoid our own insecurity, because sometimes we start to think: \u2018That\u2019s a good idea but I cannot make it happen.\u2019 So the key issue in Curitiba was to start \u2013 we had the courage to start.\u201d  When I press Lerner on the political implications of this kind of strong-arming \u2013 which some have described as a \u201ctechnocratic approach without participation\u201d \u2013 he has a ready response: \u201cDemocracy is not consensus. Democracy is a conflict that is well managed. It\u2019s about how you manage that conflict \u2013 sometimes for the minority, sometimes for the majority. But it has to happen.\u201d      Today Curitiba boasts more than 50 sq metres of green space per person. Photograph: Alamy    Guided by this learning-by-doing philosophy, Curitiba became a laboratory for urban planning innovation. In 1974, Lerner and the IPPUC introduced a new street design that provided express lanes for buses. Passengers would board from new stations along the medians of the city\u2019s main streets, so that buses could move uninterrupted through the city. At the time, most planners were calling for the development of extensive subway systems as the cutting-edge mode of urban transport. But Lerner was \u2013 and remains \u2013 a major advocate of surface transport, while critical of subway projects that drain public funds and disrupt city life. As one of his most oft-cited sayings goes: \u201cIf you want creativity, cut one zero from the budget. If you want sustainability, cut two zeros!\u201d With the new bus transit scheme, public ridership grew steadily, as buses became both the cheapest and fastest mode of transport. But Lerner and his planners were not satisfied. In the late 1980s, he observed that the inflow and outflow of passengers was dragging the speed of the bus at each station.  Three innovations followed: a new system of raised platforms (the futuristic \u201ctube\u201d station system for which Curitiba has grown famous) that allow passengers to move straight from the station into the bus without the hassle of stairs; longer buses to add extra capacity to the fleet; and a system of pre-payment so that bus drivers do not have to issue tickets and collect money on the go.     Curitiba\u2019s futuristic \u2018tube\u2019 station system for buses. Photograph: Alamy    The impact was marked: today, roughly 85% of Curitiba uses the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a complete network,\u201d Lerner explains. \u201cWe are transporting two million each day, while the London subway carries three million.\u201d His pride in the system is clear: \u201cWe started BRT in 1974; now 300 cities around the world are using it.\u201d For Lerner and his team, the social implications for the city were all-important. \u201cWe realised people were taking such a long time to get to the city centre,\u201d Rabinovitch says. \u201cSo the idea was to incorporate the essential features of a subway system \u2013 and in doing that, people coming from the periphery were spending 20 to 25 minutes less per journey.\u201d Other projects have built on this social mission. Under the Green Exchange programme, developed by Lerner\u2019s assistant Nicolau Kl\u00fcppel in 1989, Curitiba residents trade trash for tokens \u2013 four pounds of trash for a pound of produce. Today, 90% of the city participates in its recycling programme, and more than 10,000 residents make use of the trash-for-tokens exchange. Where most cities develop mountains in landfills along the periphery, Curitiba recycles 70% of its garbage. \u201cWe can\u2019t have landfills forever, and we can\u2019t ask others to accept our trash,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cGarbage removal is a citizen responsibility.\u201d Alongside these efforts to clean the city were new programmes to green it. Back in 1971, Curitiba had only one park at the Passeio P\u00fablico downtown; today it has more than 50 sq metres of green space per person \u2013 compared to neighbouring Buenos Aires\u2019s two per person. Lerner and his team were aggressive in developing parks and city gardens, and in protecting the city\u2019s main river Iguacu from being channelised along concrete walls.     According to Lerner: \u2018When you look at the parks the architecture is just great, because it is silent architecture.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy    Lerner focuses less on these big projects, however, than on the smallest details of sustainable planning. \u201cIf you visit Curitiba, the private architecture is normal \u2013 some terrible buildings, some good ones. But when you look at the parks, the architecture is just great, because it is silent architecture. We bought treated, wooden poles from the energy company and used them for all the architecture in the parks \u2013 so, existing tree poles could substitute concrete poles ... Like I said, if you want creativity, cut some zeros!\u201d A sustainable future Among many observers, Curitiba\u2019s list of accolades generates some suspicion. Can it all be true? Did Curitiba really avoid so many pitfalls of planning in Latin America?  The short answer, according to Bill McKibben \u2013 an environmentalist and author who writes extensively on the city in Hope, Human, and Wild \u2013 is yes: \u201cCuritibanos were cynical themselves, and somewhat introverted \u2013 they are not the gregarious Brazilians of Rio or Recife. But against their own conservatism, they came to like their city a lot.\u201d \u201cMany people ask me about how Curitiba did all this,\u201d says Rabinovitch. \u201cThey say the population of Curitiba is more educated, or more European. But what we usually say is that the population is not made by Swiss clockmakers. Up to 8% of Curitiba still lives in favelas; it is not a socio-economic island within the Brazilian context.\u201d   Related: Story of cities #38: Vancouver dumps its freeway plan for a more beautiful future    Yet for Rabinovitch and many others, Curitiba still offers inspiration: \u201cWhen I go to visit my mother-in-law in Jardim das Americas, I can see parakeets, birds, trees in her backyard. In other Brazilian capitals, this doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 growth was unplanned, and uncontrollable.\u201d  Since Lerner\u2019s departure, Curitiba has begun a backslide that threatens its status as the singular case of enlightened planning. Car-use is up, bike- and bus-use down, and crime statistics continue to linger around national averages.   Yet Curitiba\u2019s early accomplishments remain. \u201cAdministrations change, people change, leaders change. But there is still ownership by the population,\u201d says Rabinovitch. \u201cThe city centre is already preserved. No one would be so crazy as to eliminate the pedestrian streets now, or to pull down the old buildings and construct high-rises, as they were doing in the 60s and 70s.\u201d  \u201cPolitics is about providing a collective dream,\u201d Lerner says, \u201cand creating a scenario that everyone can understand and see is desirable. Then they will help you make it happen.\u201d Does your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development?
