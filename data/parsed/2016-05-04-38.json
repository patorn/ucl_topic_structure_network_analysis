  "body": "A public inquiry should examine the way Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government used the police to occupy communities during the 1980s miners\u2019 strike, a former chief constable has said. Sir Peter Fahy said the police attitudes that caused public outrage last week, following the Hillsborough inquest verdicts, were fostered by events such as the government using officers to crush one of Britain\u2019s bitterest industrial disputes. Fahy retired in 2015 as chief constable of Greater Manchester police, one of Britain\u2019s biggest forces. He said the use of police to serve a political agenda in the 1980s created a \u201cthem and us\u201d culture, evident in the police response at Hillsborough. The legacy was still causing damage to the reputation of the police today as well as grief to families on the receiving end, he said.   Related: Seumas Milne: A generation on, the miners' strike can speak to our time    Fahy said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for a public inquiry into the policing of the miners\u2019 strike, not just Orgreave and the role of the police, but also the role of politicians. We need to look at the wider context of the way the police were used and the agenda set for them by government. Clearly it was about, in effect, national control of the police, in pursuit of a political agenda at the time. \u201cWe need to look at the way police in those communities were used as an army of occupation, created a culture of them and us \u2013 which people are concerned about at Hillsborough. The way the police force was used at that time helped to create a damaging culture. \u201cThe concern about Hillsborough is that the police saw it as an enforcement role and not public safety. If you are wondering how that came about, it\u2019s about the culture created in the 1980s, from the inner city riots, to the policing of the miners\u2019 strike, where the police then saw it as about enforcement and controlling role rather than a public safety role. Where did those attitudes [at Orgreave] come from? If you want to look at Orgreave you need to look at the wider context.\u201d Fahy\u2019s comments came as critics of the police action confronting workers at the Orgreave steel production coking plant in 1984 called on the new interim chief constable of South Yorkshire police to open up the force\u2019s archives.   Related: Theresa May to heed campaigners' call for inquiry into battle of Orgreave    The challenge from the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign came the day after Dave Jones, chief constable of North Yorkshire police, marked the moment he took over temporary control of the South Yorkshire force by offering to listen to activists, as well as to the families of the 96 people who died in the Hillsborough football stadium disaster. Barbara Jackson, secretary for the campaign, said campaigners would take up the offer from Jones but said they did not want it to be a token gesture. She said they wanted the chief constable to intervene in their legal effort to persuade the home secretary, Theresa May, to hold a public inquiry into the events at Orgreave 32 years ago. Arthur Scargill, the politician and trade unionist who led the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike, and was arrested during the disturbances, has also called for a public inquiry into the events. The rare public intervention by Scargill, 78, came as the Yorkshire Post said it had seen redacted sections of an Independent Police Complaints Commission report that the paper said revealed that the same senior officers and solicitor were involved both in the aftermath of Orgreave and Hillsborough in 1989.  South Yorkshire police referred itself to the IPCC in 2012 over allegations that officers colluded to write court statements relating to Orgreave.  The IPCC later said the passage of time prevented a formal investigation but said there was support for the allegation that senior police exaggerated pickets\u2019 use of violence. The commission said on Tuesday it was now considering whether an unredacted version of the report could be made public. Jackson said: \u201cWe would be prepared to meet with Dave Jones if it\u2019s going to be a productive meeting, and not just a token gesture.\u201d The events of the \u201cBattle of Orgreave\u201d at the coking plant on the borders of Rotherham and Sheffield came to symbolise the miners\u2019 strike. Large numbers of pickets were confronted by about 6,000 police from across the UK. Police charged 95 miners following the disturbances but the workers\u2019 trial collapsed. Virtually all traces of the coking plant and the pit next to it have since been eradicated. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cAs I\u2019ve always said, we won\u2019t have the truth about Hillsborough until we have the full truth about Orgreave. Finally, this report provides proof of what has long been suspected \u2013 that underhand tactics were used first against South Yorkshire miners, before being deployed to much more deadly effect against Liverpool supporters.\u201d Burnham added: \u201cLike the people of Liverpool, the mining communities of South Yorkshire now need to be told the truth about their police force and the policing of the miners\u2019 strike. On the back of these revelations Theresa May must now order a disclosure process not just on Orgreave but on the policing of the miners\u2019 strike.\u201d The appointment of Jones follows the suspension of the South Yorkshire chief constable David Crompton, following the Hillsborough inquests, and the short-lived tenure of his deputy, Dawn Copley, who stood down from the temporary role after it emerged she was under investigation by her previous force for alleged misconduct. The Home Office said: \u201cThese powers are only to be used once an individual has been arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence. They are reactive in nature and should not negatively impact community relations.\u201d",
