  "body": "After a week of make-up meetings with Donald Trump, Republican party leaders have arrived at a new strategy to accommodate their presumptive presidential nominee: ignore his problematic attitude to women, his tax issues and his fluctuating positions on trade, immigration, foreign relations and a host of other topics, and instead embrace the will of Republican voters.   Planet Trump   The switch was illuminated on Sunday, a day after the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged mistreatment and objectification of women in his personal life.  Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, told Fox News Sunday that if voters have shown they are prepared to ride over issues surrounding the nominee\u2019s behavior, so should the party.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this primary for over a year,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t care. The question is, who is going to bring an earthquake to Washington DC?\u201d Trump, Priebus added, \u201crepresents something much different from the analysis of traditional candidates. Donald Trump is going to have to answer the question, but we\u2019re in a year where nothing applies.  \u201cIt\u2019s down to the bigger question: Who is going to blow up the system? That\u2019s what this election is coming down to.\u201d  Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, now a potential Trump running mate, also told Fox that whatever its reservations, the party should withhold judgment in part because the candidate\u2019s appeal exists outside traditional political constraints.  \u201cDonald Trump makes no claims for his life before he ran for office,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a very successful businessman, he\u2019s learned a great deal, and he would do more to change Washington than any other candidate.  \u201cNow he defeated 16 other people for candidacy and won more votes than any other Republican candidate in history because voters decided he will change Washington.\u201d Trump\u2019s top adviser, Paul Manafort, did, however, seek to diffuse the latest Trump controversy: the allegation that he posed as his own publicist, \u201cJohn Miller\u201d, in a 1990 interview.    It\u2019s down to the bigger question: Who is going to blow up the system? That\u2019s what this election is coming down to  Reince Priebus     Trump has admitted under oath that he used the pseudonyms \u201cJohn Baron\u201d and \u201cJohn Miller\u201d at that time. The voice on the John Miller recording, released by the the Washington Post, does sound very much like Trump.   \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell who it is,\u201d Manafort told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cDonald Trump says it\u2019s not him; I believe it\u2019s not him.\u201d The allegation that Trump posed as his own publicist to promote himself has crystallised the apparent problem for the Republican party: whenever its leaders seek to contain one media drama over the presumptive nominee, another emerges.  Echoing the Republican leadership, Manafort said simply that the issue of whether Miller was or was not Trump was \u201ctotally irrelevant\u201d. Manafort also said Trump had not refused to release his tax returns \u2013 most presidential nominees do so \u2013 although the candidate told ABC earlier this week that the returns were \u201cnone of your business\u201d. \u201cHe has said he will release his tax returns. He never has changed his position,\u201d Manafort said, blaming the delay on an IRS audit, though the IRS has said repeatedly there is no legal barrier for the release of returns during an audit.  \u201cAs I understand it, the audit is going back for the last eight years,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cAnything going on beyond eight years is not going to be of interest to anyone beyond the media. This is an issue that the media is interested in; it\u2019s not an issue that middle America is interested in.\u201d Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s likely opponent in November, has released tax returns dating to 1977. The decision by mainstream Republicans to tolerate Trump\u2019s excesses is a pragmatic one. Last week, after a closed-door meeting, House speaker Paul Ryan said he and Trump \u201cwere planting the seeds to get ourselves unified\u201d. Asked on Sunday how the meeting had gone, Manafort said the most senior elected Republican had not asked Trump to change.  \u201cAnd there\u2019s no reason for him to change [after] beating 16 qualified candidates,\u201d he said. However, there are still murmurs of an effort to mount a third-party challenge. According to the Washington Post, the plotters include 2012 candidate Mitt Romney and the conservative commentator William Kristol. Their efforts have been rebuffed, though, as party moderates conclude that going up against Trump would be certain to fail.    Related: How Donald Trump convinced the Republican party to revolve around him    \u201cThis is a suicide mission,\u201d Priebus told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cWhat people should do is take the Paul Ryan approach, which is to work with Donald Trump and find out whether or not there\u2019s common ground \u2026 as opposed to blowing everything up.\u201d That approach also comes with dangers: Clinton has the highest negative ratings of any presidential candidate in history except one: Donald Trump. Get too close to Trump, or at least appear to tacitly endorse him, and those negatives could begin to rub off on candidates in tight congressional races.  Republicans are betting that in crucial swing states, the polls will tighten, and even female voters currently seen as implacably opposed to Trump could yet come round.  \u201cThis is one of these conventional wisdom facts that are not correct,\u201d Manafort told CNN, although he did concede that Trump struggled with women.  \u201cIt\u2019s an issue. It\u2019ll be dealt with,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to a healing process. This is way early and still already we\u2019re seeing convergence on the party of the electorate on Donald Trump.\u201d",
