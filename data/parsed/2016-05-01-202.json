  "body": "I am an obsessive collector of vegetable gardening books. I have been since I was eight years old. Yet there is something I find curious about all of them. Almost without fail, page after page is dedicated to the cultivation of spinach, while a few chapters later similar space is dedicated to the eradication of dandelions. As a botanist I can\u2019t help but think: what if they were the other way round? What makes one plant a weed and another a prized edible worth so much time and effort? Despite being cast as a horticultural villain, dandelions are actually one of the oldest crops, with fresh, tender leaves. They are a popular salad green, from France and Italy to China and India. With good reason, too, as the vegetal bitterness is virtually identical to the flavour of other leafy crops, like chicory (to which it is related). Nutritionally it doesn\u2019t fare badly either, having twice the vitamin A of spinach per serving (more than your daily dose in each handful) and more than double the vitamin C, not to mention a huge helping of more than five times your recommended daily intake of vitamin K. Spinach is not only a runner-up in the vitamin stakes, it also is comparatively bland, without any of the dandelion\u2019s gutsy radicchio-meets-rocket flavour. Anyone who has tried it will also tell you that spinach is not the easiest crop to grow, with its tendency to bolt into flower at the slightest hint of being kept too dry or too hot. Dandelions, by contrast, literally plant themselves. They are also super high-yielding, and generate big bunches of pretty yellow flowers that are great for pollinators at the time of year when they need them most. I grow mine by simply lifting dandelions that pop up on their own in my beds and borders (you don\u2019t have to be to gentle about this) and planting them spaced about 30cm apart in a bed of rich soil. If they are in shadier spots, with a weekly douse of water, the leaves will grow far larger and lusher and have a milder flavour. Some growers will even cover plants in large buckets or terracotta pots for a few weeks in the early spring. In this dark environment the new growth will emerge primrose-yellow and elongated. This process, known as blanching, makes for milder, more tender leaves \u2013 exactly as is done for conventional chicory. I love to eat them just as you would any salad green, or briefly saut\u00e9ed in garlic, lemon and olive oil. They make an amazing salad tossed in the hot fat from crispy fried lardons along with a handful of croutons and a tablespoon of chopped chives. For years the idea of eating dandelions has come with associations of eccentricity, but strip the prejudices aside and all you are left with is a healthy, delicious chicory that requires next to no work to grow.
