Something enlightening Let\u2019s start with a classic. This week\u2019s This American Life episode is a delightful delve into the show\u2019s archives. Promised Land features all kinds of people who are looking for a spiritual awakening, from a little girl\u2019s devotion to Disneyland to a potentially life-changing conversation overheard on a train. In it, the late and wonderful David Rakoff tries a 20-day fast to see if he can achieve spiritual enlightenment like the Buddha, monks, saints and new age gurus have accomplished. He doesn\u2019t exactly (\u201cI think I\u2019m doing it wrong!\u201d), but it\u2019s worth every minute. Plus, Ira Glass sings (is that a plus?).  \u2022 Promised Land by This American Life (ep 259)Duration: 1 hourListen here / Subscribe hereCome for the nostalgia, stay for the scientific research. Something hopeful Another Round has been one of the happiest results of the podcasting boom. Produced by Buzzfeed and hosted by Heben Nigatu and Tracy Clayton, it features heartwarming, funny-as-hell episodes such as this week\u2019s on 11-year-old Marley Dias, who created the #1000blackgirlbooks campaign to collect children\u2019s books with black girls for main characters, after becoming tired of reading about \u201cwhite boys and their dogs\u201d. She talks about travelling to Ghana, where \u201cliterally every single place you go there is a black person on a billboard\u201d or on the street, and delivers lines such as: \u201cIn America, there\u2019s so much difference in everyone, that it\u2019s just hard for us to sometimes feel like we\u2019re special or that we\u2019re important because we know there are other people out there who are still different than us and what does that prove to us? It doesn\u2019t give us power, it doesn\u2019t make us feel important if we feel like we\u2019re alone.\u201d Yep, she\u2019s 11 alright. The roundtable that follows with her, the hosts and writer Ashley Ford discussing their favourite books is unmissable.  \u2022 #1000BlackGirlBooks (with Marley Dias) by Another Round (ep 55)Duration: 57 minutesListen here / Subscribe hereFurther readingCome for the cuteness, stay for the female empowerment.       Something blue \u201cI put on a sweater. I went outside with him for a parting cigarette and kissed him goodbye in the forgiving October air. We had met in October, too, and at once it seemed like a very long time ago and only a whisper, like all time, really.\u201d If the New York Times\u2019s Modern Love column series about relationships wasn\u2019t touching enough, this podcast is taking our teary commutes to the next level. The premise is simple: actors and notable personalities narrate essays from the series, often with updates from the writers. Somehow, though, the simplicity makes it all the more powerful. This week, actress Taissa Farmiga of American Horror Story fame reads Friends Without Benefits by Hannah Selinger, about the pain and frustration of waiting for love before learning to let someone go. \u2022 Friends Without Benefits by Modern Love (ep 19)Duration: 17 minutesListen here / Subscribe hereCome for the story, stay for the post-scripts about what happened next. Bonus: something new(ish) If you still haven\u2019t listened to 2 Dope Queens, you can catch up with it and get that feeling of completion without having to renounce your social life. This standup and storytelling podcast launched a couple of months ago on WNYC. It\u2019s recorded in Brooklyn before a live audience and features Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams, along with their comedians of choice, talking about \u201csex, romance, race, hair journeys, living in New York, and Billy Joel. Plus a whole bunch of other s**t\u201d. This week, on top of some excellent standup guests, the hosts imagine what they\u2019d do if they had a penis for a day (Spoiler alert: \u201cNothing substansh.\u201d Head to minute 40:42). Phoebe also reveals that she \u201cgave up on life two days ago and signed up for Tinder\u201d \u2013 and provides the most accurate analysis of the dating app I\u2019ve heard to this day.
