  "body": "Good news about TTIP (Protest never changes anything? Look at how this trade deal has been derailed, 5 May), but the victory for people power would not have been possible without the leaking of secret documents. Ironical, then, that the European parliament has just voted in favour of criminalising whistleblowers who leak information about corporations, and journalists who publish said information. How long a stretch do you reckon you would get for another Panama Papers?Mike JonesPinhoe, Exeter \u2022 As any true Archers listener knows, the scheming Rob Titchener hasn\u2019t legally adopted Helen\u2019s son, Henry (Saturday Interview, 7 May) but took the much quicker option of a step-parent responsibility agreement, which he persuaded Helen to sign.Anne LiddonTynemouth \u2022 Is the solution to the doctors\u2019 strikes to follow the example of the academisation of schools, and free hospitals to set their own terms and conditions? Though I wouldn\u2019t be too keen on unqualified doctors.Averil LewinEly \u2022 So this is a listening government, according to the ever U-turning education secretary Nicky Morgan. Will John Whittingdale be listening before or after the white paper on the BBC?Malcolm RiversIsleworth, Middlesex \u2022 Great piece about Leicester City from Julian Barnes (So we\u2019re all Foxes now? I\u2019ve been one for 65 years, 7 May), but even I know Holland are not in the Euros this year and I\u2019m a Blackpool supporter.Linda SmithBlackpool \u2022 How about if David Attenborough changes his name to Boaty McBoatface and then democracy could prevail (\u2018Boaty McBoatface\u2019 ship to be called RRS Sir David Attenborough, 7 May).Kathleen O\u2019NeillHayling Island, Hampshire \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
