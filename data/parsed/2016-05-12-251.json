  "body": "Looking through the letter marked \u201cAtos healthcare\u201d, Lucia \u2013 who has severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety \u2013 can only remember fragments of the assessment for personal independence payments (PIP) she had two months ago. A normal day is often hard enough for the 34-year-old. Lucia\u2019s husband Daniel, a former hospital administrator, had to leave work three years ago to become her full-time carer. She\u2019s been relying on disability living allowance (DLA) \u2013 the benefit the government is replacing with PIP \u2013 for six years to pay for weekly therapy sessions. On the days running up to her Atos medical, Lucia tells me she \u201cwasn\u2019t functioning\u201d because of the stress: she couldn\u2019t get dressed, wash, or leave the house.   Related: Personal independence payments are a punishment of the poor and ill | Polly Toynbee    But within a few minutes of the assessment itself, she began to panic: she could hear voices coming from the room next door. Due to a shortage in facilities, the assessor told her and Daniel that the assessment room had been\u00a0divided\u00a0in two and without soundproofing \u2013 so as Lucia had her medical, she could hear another disabled person being assessed. That would be uncomfortable for anyone, but for Lucia it was impossible: a symptom of her PTSD is that she hears internal \u201cvoices\u201d and conversations. As Lucia began to shake and cry, Daniel was told no other rooms were available. The assessor offered to reschedule the appointment but as having to go through an assessment again would further trigger Lucia\u2019s condition, she had no choice but to continue. \u201cI was trapped,\u201d she says. For the rest of the assessment, Lucia had to answer the assessor\u2019s questions with earphones in, playing music from an MP3 player to distract herself from the voices with calming \u201cwhite noise\u201d. \u201cI couldn\u2019t concentrate. I went blank,\u201d she says. \u201cDaniel had to help me with responses. I don\u2019t even remember it.\u201d The next day, Daniel wrote to Atos on behalf of Lucia about their concern that this situation would affect the result. A week later, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) informed Lucia she\u2019d been rejected for PIP. She\u2019d scored zero points in the assessment.    Lucia knows their money will soon run out and the couple is now cutting back on food.    \u201cTo have your decision based on such a flawed assessment is ridiculous,\u201d Lucia says. \u201cThey should have cancelled before I got there. They knew [my condition]. They knew what would happen.\u201d But she tells me the report by Atos barely mentions any of it. \u201c[The report has] one sentence: \u2018The claimant had difficulties with this assessment.\u2019 That\u2019s it. The only reference to the room,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a complete breakdown in the medical and they didn\u2019t even put that in.\u201d Now without her benefit, she has no way to pay the \u00a345 needed each week for her therapy. \u201cI had my last session on 11 April when my last DLA went out. I don\u2019t have PIP, so I can\u2019t have it,\u201d she says. She pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve had a relapse \u2026 My symptoms are getting worse. I only ever felt able to go out with my husband and now it feels impossible. It\u2019s taking so much effort just to function.\u201d Among all the rhetoric on so-called \u201cbenefit reform\u201d, what the Conservatives don\u2019t mention is that DLA \u2013 and now PIP \u2013 is what\u2019s in technical terms \u201ca gateway benefit\u201d. That means that when disabled people such as Lucia are rejected for transferring to PIP, they don\u2019t just lose DLA \u2013 they can also lose several other benefits that they\u2019ve been relying on for years.     \u2018Lucia has severe post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.\u2019    As Lucia puts it to me: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like dominos.\u201d The same day her DLA was stopped, Daniel\u2019s carers\u2019 allowance was too. Because that went, so did Lucia\u2019s income support. The couple\u2019s housing benefit was also suspended (it\u2019s since been reinstated after the council assessed them as needing support). In the space of a day, Lucia says, \u201ceverything that we had before has stopped\u201d. That\u2019s almost \u00a3300 a week. \u201cWe\u2019re not living. We\u2019re just surviving.\u201d Currently, this survival is coming from money they saved from the previous month\u2019s DLA \u201cin case the worst\u201d happened with PIP. Lucia knows this will soon run out and the couple is now cutting back on food.   Related: \u00a313bn in unclaimed welfare? It\u2019s just fuel for the Tories\u2019 Big Benefits Myth | Frances Ryan    \u201cWe\u2019re lucky because there\u2019s a place down the road that sells food past its best-before date so it\u2019s still legal to sell it,\u201d she says. Lucia plans to appeal against her rejection for PIP but before she can, she must first go through what the DWP call mandatory reconsideration \u2013 a compulsory process where the decision is \u201creconsidered\u201d. She receives no money in the meantime. \u201cThey backdate it if you win but what good\u2019s that now?\u201d she says. \u201cIt should only take a month. Now [they say] it\u2019s nine weeks because of a lack of staff. They say they\u2019ve got more work than they were expecting.\u201d It took until last Wednesday for Lucia and Daniel to get a reply from Atos \u2013 weeks after she\u2019d already been rejected. The firm apologised and said the room division was a temporary measure (that won\u2019t be repeated) caused by a lack of available computers. When I contacted Atos, a spokesperson told me that they\u2019d reviewed\u00a0the assessment report produced \u201cwhich was appropriately detailed and justified\u201d. But taking into account the concerns raised, they will now ask for Lucia\u2019s case to \u201cbe sent back\u00a0to us so that we can look to\u00a0schedule\u00a0a\u00a0reassessment\u00a0as a home consultation\u201d. They apologised again. \u201cThey were under pressure to have that appointment then. That\u2019s what it felt like,\u201d Lucia says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s under pressure. The government set the targets and Atos follow.\u201d",
