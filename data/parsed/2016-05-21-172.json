Related: Self-immolation: desperate protests against Australia's detention regime    The Iranian national was a recognised refugee living in Nibok settlement on Nauru with his wife. After his funeral his family released a statement saying: \u201cOur hope is gone\u201d. \u201cOmid is gone forever,\u201d it said. \u201c\u2018Omid\u2019 means \u2018hope\u2019 in Persian. His father named him Omid because his birth gave hope, excitement and life to his small family. \u201cOur Omid had it all: warm, friendly, always smiling, witty, and athletic ability.  \u201cThere is no word that can express how bitter is his loss for us. Our Omid is gone, our hope is dead; so unbelievable, so sudden! We were counting on him, like always, like what he was saying every time; counting for better future, counting for sweet coming moments,\u201d it said. \u201cOmid was doing well, enduring hardships for better future. What happened to Omid\u2019s hope? Who has taken his hope? Who has taken our hope, our Omid? Who has made the life so bitter for him?\u201d According to one witness to Omid\u2019s suicide, before he self-immolated he told bystanders, \u201cThis is how tired we are, this action will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it any more.\u201d The incident was captured on mobile phone video.

Five people are believed to have self-harmed on the island on the same day. Masoumali\u2019s widow told Guardian Australia her husband was not given a sheet or a place to lie down, and that the hospital \u201cdidn\u2019t even have a clean syringe\u201d. \u201cStaff in Nauru hospital couldn\u2019t help Omid in any way because they were unequipped,\u201d she said. \u201cA lack of proper equipment and facilities was the reason that staff couldn\u2019t help and treat Omid in the Nauru hospital.\u201d The Nauru government has said Masoumali received \u201cthe highest level of care\u201d.",
