  "body": "LinkedIn is leading the pack when it comes to professional networking, with 433 million users and the likes of Richard Branson, Bill Gates and Arianna Huffington all contributing to the site. Rather than just making contacts and sharing CVs, the site has evolved as a place where entrepreneurs can offer and receive advice, seek inspiration and discuss the issues of the day. As an entrepreneur, it\u2019s important to keep your own page optimised to raise your own business\u2019s profile. Here\u2019s how to make the best use of LinkedIn and other professional networks.  Keep them updated The golden rule when it comes to networking \u2013 both personally and professionally \u2013 is to keep the content fresh. If you have a LinkedIn account, make sure it is updated with your company\u2019s latest developments, new hires and big business wins. There\u2019s nothing worse than heading to a page of a company you\u2019re interested in and seeing that it hasn\u2019t been updated since February of last year.    Related: More business, more opportunities. Just don\u2019t call it networking    To make sure that the posts are fairly regularly updated, assign the role to someone in the business with the capacity to devote time to it every week. LinkedIn recommend that you post at least 20 times a month and aim to publish at 7-8am and 5-6pm, avoiding Mondays and Fridays.  It\u2019s personal  Nothing beats a personal, word-of-mouth recommendation. You can use LinkedIn to ask people that you\u2019ve done business with to endorse you for your skills. It\u2019s possible to identify key skills in your profile to coordinate those recommendations and prevent your profile from becoming diluted. For example, if you run a design company, multiple endorsements about your proficiency with spreadsheets isn\u2019t that helpful.  When it comes to your photo, make sure that it showcases you in a professional light. That means no photos on a night out, on holiday, or with friends. Opt instead for a work-appropriate outfit and plain background.  There may well be a number of relevant groups to join too, that show what your interests are and increase your network\u2019s reach. These can be related to your business, connect to your university school or college, be for social causes you care about, and passions that you have in your spare time. Make time to comment on posts within these networks to raise your profile.  Consider other options In terms of professional networking, LinkedIn is the most well-known platform, but there are competitors gaining ground, such as Facebook at Work, and publishing app Snapchat.  Snapchat is particularly popular with the startup generation, who are making connections in a more experimental way. It\u2019s an interesting tool for social media campaigns too \u2013 the videos are quicker and easier to produce, and you can easily target your chosen audience.  Use it to get more business LinkedIn can also help you to get more business for your own company, simply by raising its profile in the right way. Follow these tips and you\u2019ll be well on your way to achieving just that.
