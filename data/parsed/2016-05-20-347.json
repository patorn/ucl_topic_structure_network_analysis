On Thursday Christie got reimbursed up to $400,000 for his dignity. In a campaign fundraiser at a National Guard armory in a bucolic Trenton suburb, Trump gave a speech to a crowd of hundreds, many of whom had paid up to $200 to attend. Trump stuck to familiar themes about immigration and trade, adding a new wrinkle by saying: \u201cWho the hell cares if there\u2019s a trade war [with China]?\u201d The event, accompanied by a high-dollar fundraiser for the New Jersey Republican party, represented a Trump rally in miniature. The same blaring soundtrack, the same ardent shouts of \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d but all for the first time to a paying crowd, in an attempt to clear outstanding campaign debt from Christie\u2019s unsuccessful presidential bid. The presumptive nominee boasted as he took the stage: \u201cChris paid off his entire debt tonight. The whole debt!\u201d Thursday marked one of the first fundraising events for Trump, who long insisted throughout his presidential primary that he was self-funding his campaign. However, the presumptive nominee has now announced that he will raise money in the general election and entered into a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee earlier this week to funnel donations to what has long been predicted to be a billion-dollar campaign.            Christie defends expression behind Trump: \u2018I wasn\u2019t being held hostage\u2019    Trump, a longtime political donor to both parties, is easing into the process by doing the event for Christie, who has become one of his most loyal allies and most important surrogates in the past few months. Christie gave the nominee a typically glowing introduction, saying of Trump, who has had four of his businesses go through bankruptcy: \u201cHe has brought greatness to every enterprise he has ever led.\u201d  The New Jersey governor also praised the presumptive nominee\u2019s foreign policy acumen: \u201cWe need a strong president who will fight back and defend America first and I am confident that president will be a Donald Trump.\u201d Before introducing Trump, Christie added that he and his wife had been friends with the businessman \u201cfor 14 years \u2013 you never ever make a mistake by standing with your friend and Donald Trump is my friend\u201d. Although Christie wasn\u2019t standing behind his friend during his half-hour long speech, he still had an awkward moment when Trump seemed to joke about the New Jersey governor\u2019s struggles to lose weight. Referencing his own boycott of Oreo cookies for shifting some production jobs to Mexico, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m not eating Oreos any more you know. Neither is Chris.\u201d  Other than his jibe at Christie, Trump hit familiar themes, insisting that the crash of EgyptAir MS804 was an act of terrorism. \u201cIf anyone thinks the plane wasn\u2019t blown out of the sky, you\u2019re 100% wrong folks,\u201d he told the crowd. At the time Trump was speaking, the Egyptian government had said terrorism was more likely than mechanical issues, but no conclusions had been reached.  The presumptive nominee also compared the United States to \u201ca big big sloppy bully who gets punched in the face and gets knocked down\u201d. Trump also told those in the crowd wary about his call for a potential trade war in China: \u201cA lot of you don\u2019t know the world of economics. Don\u2019t worry. Leave it to me. Enjoy your life.\u201d The fundraiser was Trump\u2019s first public event in over a week. He has curtailed his schedule after clinching the Republican nomination, instead spending much of his time reaching out to party leaders including Speaker Paul Ryan and building up his threadbare campaign apparatus.",
