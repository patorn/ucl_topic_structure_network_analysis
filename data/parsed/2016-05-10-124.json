  "body": "A mixed blessing of social media is that it allows pop stars to convey their thoughts directly to fans. While it can be painful to read the unpunctuated trumpetings of some YouTube embryo, it represents a much better deal for fans than was the case in the 1970s, when teen magazines were the immoveable gatekeepers to the stars. American pop fans had an especially hard lot: the biggest magazine, 16, had a distinctly autocratic flavour, with an editor who encouraged readers to address her as Miss Stavers \u2013 no first names tolerated \u2013 and reputedly flew into a fury when teenage readers turned up at her office.  Miss Stavers left in 1975 and was replaced by her assistant, Danny Fields, who co-edited 16 (with Randi Reisfeld) for the next five years. In a small but significant way, that changed my life. As a kid who\u2019d discovered 16 towards the end of Stavers\u2019s reign, I was the target audience for Fields\u2019 big strategy, which was to introduce America to the Bay City Rollers. He had a hunch that the Edinburgh group would be the first UK boyband to break the US since the 60s, and featured them on 13 successive covers. It was one of many Fields hunches that proved right: thanks to him, millions of American girls, me included, found their entry-level boyband.   Related: Ramones: 'They were outcasts who had contempt for those who rejected them'    Years later, I found out that during his entire time as editor, he had also been managing the Ramones. What? The guy who\u2019d written all those giddy stories about the Scottish dreamboats had been helping to found punk at the same time? The British equivalent would have been Bernard Rhodes editing Jackie while managing the Clash: it just didn\u2019t compute. And Fields wasn\u2019t some weekend punk: he stayed with the Ramones until 1980 (they finally parted ways because the band were frustrated at having never had a hit single) and was the subject of their song Danny Says (which subsequently lent its name to a 2015 documentary about Fields\u2019 life). The rest of his CV is equally documentary-worthy. Fields, who grew up in New York and still lives there, sees himself primarily as a photographer and interviewer \u2013 his current project is a book of photos of the Ramones he took in the mid-70s, titled My Ramones. But he was really a blue-chip trendspotter. It was partly talent and partly luck, but he was present at several cultural turning points in the 60s and 70s, and found ways to influence events. As an Elektra Records A&R man \u2013 a job he landed because he\u2019d been the publicist for Elektra signing the Doors \u2013 he signed two Detroit bands whose visceral rock signalled to him that the mid-60s hippie idyll was over. He went to Detroit to secure the MC5, then saw them supported by what he called their \u201cbaby brother band\u201d, and insisted the label sign the Stooges as well. He is friends with Iggy Pop and the 5\u2019s Wayne Kramer to this day. Similarly, having seen a 17-minute Ramones set at CBGBs in 1974, he instantly offered to manage them. He persuaded Seymour Stein of Sire Records to sign them, and took on Stein\u2019s wife Linda as co-manager. Not long afterward, he took over at 16, but if he ever cross-pollinated by using 16 as a platform for the Ramones, I don\u2019t remember it. He must have realised that a hairy stick insect like Joey Ramone wouldn\u2019t have been a good fit with the doe-eyed sex thimbles who populated the magazine\u2019s pages.      From the photography book My Ramones, by their former manager Danny Fields.    Before all that, after a brief stint at Harvard law school, he had been a peripheral member of Warhol\u2019s Factory crowd, becoming close friends with Nico and Lou Reed (there\u2019s an audio recording of him playing a Ramones demo to Reed, who effusively responds: \u201cThat is without doubt the most fantastic thing you\u2019ve ever played for me, bar none\u201d). He introduced Nico to Jim Morrison, and \u2013 he claims \u2013 David Cassidy to cocaine. But he wasn\u2019t undiscerning, declining to manage an unknown Boston band called Aerosmith because he didn\u2019t like the group\u2019s members. And the furore over John Lennon\u2019s remark that the Beatles were bigger than Jesus? That was Fields, too. In 1966, while editing a teen magazine called Datebook, he came across the quote, which had attracted little notice when it appeared in London\u2019s Evening Standard a few months before. Fields thought it an eye-catching comment, and put it on the cover of Datebook. The ensuing controversy figured in the Beatles\u2019 decision never to tour again. The Danny Says documentary is full of famous people, including Iggy and Kramer, remembering a life that combined hedonism and an unerring ear for the next thing, even when the next thing initially appeared to be more spectacle than substance. \u201cThis was a guy who would look at something that nobody else was really ready to see and say, \u2018People could enjoy this \u2013 this should be everywhere,\u2019\u201d Iggy Pop says in the film. Fields himself blames the parents: \u201cI always went against the grain, whether it was because I was a flaming faggot or because I didn\u2019t like my parents\u2019 taste in anything.\u201d  It helped, naturally, that he came of age when music was undergoing seismic changes, and lived in the city where much of the countercultural spadework was being done. Out and proud early (he chose to go to Harvard because he expected to find \u201ccute boys\u201d there), he immersed himself in the alternative scene. Its acceptance of gender non-conformity and Fields\u2019s innate gregariousness quickly saw him travelling in the scenester top tier. Along the way, he photographed everything, and, encouraged by Warhol, taped phone conversations too. His archive is so big that he\u2019s donated much of it to Yale University\u2019s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.  In the documentary, Fields is self-deprecating: \u201cMy talent is just that I\u2019m a super audience member, a No 1 fan. And I think I have good taste.\u201d As the success of the Bay City Rollers proved, good taste can be wide-ranging and open-minded.",
