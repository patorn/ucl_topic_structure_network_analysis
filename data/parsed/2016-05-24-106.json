  "body": "Free-range chickens, raised flower beds and exercise apparatus on neatly manicured lawns are not what you would normally expect to find in a closed prison. The grounds of Rivendell unit, a special \u201cpsychologically informed environment\u201d for female prisoners with personality disorders, feels more like a place of healing than incarceration. But it is a prison within a prison \u2013 HMP New Hall, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, home to around 450 adult women, young offenders and juveniles. \u201cTreat people badly and you\u2019re not going to get good results,\u201d says Mick Winn, the governor in charge of the unit who is escorting me along the gently winding paths.    Treat people badly and you\u2019re not going to get good results  Mick Winn     I am the first journalist to be invited to visit Rivendell since it was opened 18 months ago. It is one of a number of similar units in prisons designed to provide care and treatment for offenders with complex needs. Formerly known as DSPD (dangerous and severe personality disorder) units, they are now known as Pipes (psychologically informed and planned environments). Rivendell, named after the elvish haven in Lord of the Rings, aims to provide a regime of \u201cgrowth, enablement and empowerment\u201d, which epitomises the government\u2019s plans for prisons to be places of rehabilitation as outlined in the prisons bill in last week\u2019s Queen\u2019s\u00a0speech. We enter the accommodation block, which from the outside resembles a large, modern, two-storey detached house \u2013 except for the bars on every window. The first thing that strikes me is how quiet the building is inside. It\u2019s the lunchtime \u201cbang up\u201d period and the prisoners, 30 in total \u2013 made up of around half with a diagnosed personality disorder and half without who have volunteered and then been selected to live on the unit to act as a stable influence \u2013 are all locked in their cells. Studies cited by the Ministry of Justice estimate that between 4% and 11% of the UK population have a personality disorder and between 60% and 70% of people in prison. Although a personality disorder is a mental disorder, until quite recently it was considered untreatable.   Related: Skype, iPads and in-cell education at heart of major prisons shakeup    Winn heads a team of 16 staff, among whom are senior clinicians. In the main observation and control room, where large windows allow the comings and goings of prisoners to be easily monitored, he explains how this specialised environment is designed to help resolve the issues that have driven their offending. But those women in the Rivendell unit are not entirely isolated, joining the other prisoners at HMP New Hall for work, chapel, and in the gym. \u201cThey\u2019re different women to when they first came here,\u201d Winn says. \u201cSome of our women present in a very childish way because they\u2019ve learned that if you appear as a child, people care for you. Some were really in your face, loud and aggressive, because that\u2019s how they have always learned how you get things. But after a period of time with us, all of that calms down. In our client groups we get lots and lots of self-harm. [It] tends to increase a little bit when they first arrive, maybe for the first six months. They\u2019ve been displaced, but then all the self-harm rates drop, which is a great indicator of how they are feeling mentally. At the moment, we have no service-users in any kind of crisis that might lead to self-harm.\u201d Winn opens a cell door and I see it is exactly like any prison cell, except it has an ensuite toilet and shower room. \u201cA lot of our women have body image issues. Having their own space to shower in private is really important to them.\u201d He leads me to what he describes as \u201cthe quiet area\u201d. There are easy chairs and a sofa, books and magazines, and a fish tank full of brightly coloured fish (paid for by the sale of the eggs from the chickens). The barred windows look out on to where the prison\u2019s chickens roam freely, and over the perimeter fence to rolling green fields. By now the women on the unit have been let out of their cells and a number are waiting to speak to me in a communal room used for creative pursuits such as art, crafts and baking. \u201cWhat did it feel like when you were diagnosed with a personality disorder?\u201d I ask. There\u2019s silence for a minute or two until Lydia speaks up. \u201cI think most people in the country have a personality disorder,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they manage it. We haven\u2019t managed ours very well.\u201d Lydia, in her 20s, has been jailed for life under the old joint enterprise law and is hoping for a fresh appeal. Maye is serving life with a minimum tariff of 16 years. So far she has done three. \u201cI\u2019m here because I know I need help, I need to learn how to deal with my emotions and deal with everything I didn\u2019t deal with on the out,\u201d she says. \u201cI ended up committing offences because I just didn\u2019t care. Now I\u2019m here, I feel hope \u2013 because I\u2019m getting help. I know I\u2019ve got a lot of problems, but I don\u2019t feel so alone now because I know there are other people walking the same path as me.\u201d Jane joins in. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a voice here. We can speak our minds, in the right way. I\u2019ve been in prison since 2007. The staff say I\u2019ve changed since I\u2019ve been here, but I\u2019m still finding it hard to believe.\u201d Maye nods. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a number here. The staff know us really well. They interact with us more than on normal wings.\u201d Then Grace pipes up. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am. I don\u2019t really know who I am, but I\u2019ve come here to sort myself out. At the moment I feel a bit stuck, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve come here, to find out who I am and start to live again.\u201d And then Lucy, serving life with a 15-year tariff, says: \u201cI\u2019ve been in prison for six years, and I\u2019ve been in Rivendell for nearly a year. I\u2019ve still got another seven years to serve. In the last year I\u2019ve definitely come out of myself. I used to just stay in my cell all the time, reading. I still read a lot. Now I associate with the girls here more often. For 27 odd years I haven\u2019t known who I am. The staff help you to understand yourself better. I didn\u2019t have an identity at all. I got into a stupid relationship at 14. I lost a lot of my own identity then. I\u2019m now reclaiming myself. I have a few ups and downs, but I know I\u2019m getting better at coping.\u201d For many victims of serious crime, prison regimes designed to enrich and nourish will be unpalatable at best. But the fragility of the women at Rivendell is all too obvious. Winn and his colleagues are working hard to prevent them causing more harm to themselves and others. If governors of the six reform prisons, proposed by the justice secretary, Michael Gove, can introduce a flavour of Rivendell in each one, then rehabilitation for the many prisoners rather than the few might just be attainable. Winn says: \u201cYou get really protective about the women, especially when you get to know their backgrounds. It doesn\u2019t take away the seriousness of their criminality, but when you see where they have come from and you hear the stories of what they\u2019ve suffered, you can understand how they get into drugs, alcohol, violence.\u201d Some names have been changed",
