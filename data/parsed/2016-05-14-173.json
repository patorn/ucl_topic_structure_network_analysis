  "body": "So what I\u2019m aiming for is a\u00a0completely new kind of interviewing, the polar opposite of that tired, cynical, stale, disdainful, exhausted, dated and, above all, futile \u201clying bastard\u201d routine. My hope is that on Sunday Salon we\u2019ll create a uniquely fresh, nuanced, more civilised atmosphere, where I use the warmth of my personality \u2013 and relative youth, of course, my looks are for others to judge! \u2013 to do what the old has-beens are too cynical to do, and generate more light, less heat. No \u2013 I see what you did there! \u2013 no, I\u2019m not naming names: your readers know who they are anyway, of course. Brilliant interviewers, all of them, no question, for all their weird flaws, but it would be unfair to single out people when so many journalists are still stuck in that horrible, contemptuous, inquisitorial thing. It\u2019s so vicious and tricksy, who can blame politicians for being evasive when they know their interviewer just wants to catch them out? It\u2019s my theory \u2013 we\u2019ll see if it works! \u2013 that if I softly massage their shoulders, check their makeup, pour them a hot beverage, be it tea or a hot chocolate, we can create, if you will, a safe space, where politicians can genuinely think out loud without fear of interruption, hopefully without me having even to ask a\u00a0question. In my experience, you get much more out of people with a\u00a0fascinating counter-factual, or just a\u00a0quizzically raised eyebrow.   Related: Modern tribes: the young royal     See? Thanks, that\u2019s how I got David Cameron to admit what his favourite colour was. Exactly, yellow. Up to that moment, everyone thought it was mauve. But David Frost already proved that charm works better than interrogation: his interviewees relaxed, they trusted him and, before you knew it, he had another scoop \u2013 sorry, no, I can\u2019t think of an example. But remember when George Osborne opened up to me about his 5:2 diet? That was right after I complimented him on his great body, though he said mine was even better! Quite, brilliant television. The public love to see the human side of power, and George came out of it pretty well, too.",
