  "body": "Exeter will be without their prolific try-scorer Thomas Waldrom for Saturday\u2019s Premiership final against Saracens but their influential scrum-half Will Chudley has been cleared to play after being cited for making illegal contact with the head of Wasps\u2019 Joe Launchbury in last Saturday\u2019s semi-final.   Related: Exeter Chiefs grind out win over Wasps to reach first Premiership final    Waldrom damaged knee ligaments in the closing moments of Saturday\u2019s game and will be on the sidelines for 12 weeks, ruling him out of contention for a place in the Chiefs\u2019 squad for Twickenham. The country\u2019s top try-scorer for the past two seasons has been a key member of the Chiefs\u2019 pack since signing from Leicester, although he would probably have started the final on the bench behind the in-form Don Armand. The Chiefs\u2019 head coach, Rob Baxter, concedes the Kiwi-born No8 will still leave a sizeable gap in every sense. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing for Thomas,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a fantastic season and I feel for him missing out on the final. He has been part of the driving force for us over a couple of seasons.\u201d The blow has at least been softened by the news that the energetic Chudley will be available, having avoided any punishment for inadvertently kicking Launchbury as the England forward lay on the ground. The scrum-half has never previously received a yellow card, let alone a ban, and the disciplinary panel found his leg had been crucially deflected by Matt Mullan\u2019s thigh as he attempted to kick a loose ball. Baxter believes the incident was made worse by frequent television replays that made it look more serious than it was, with the television match official having advised at the time there was no case to answer. \u201cIt was probably a little bit naughty of TV to keep showing it. I kind of think there\u2019s a bit of unwritten agreement that once an official has made a decision that should be the end of it.\u201d Exeter, however, were grateful for the support of both Launchbury and Wasps, who made clear they felt Chudley did not deserve punishment. \u201cJoe Launchbury put in a very positive statement on behalf of Will,\u201d said Baxter. \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel it was anything other than a very minor incident and he didn\u2019t think anything untoward had happened at the time. People should understand we didn\u2019t sit down in a meeting and someone said: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s quite a big game for Will Chudley next week, let\u2019s let him off.\u2019\u201d Baxter, meanwhile, has acclaimed Saracens as \u201cthe best team in Europe\u201d but is hopeful neutral supporters this weekend will side with the Chiefs. \u201cEveryone seems to be saying that and I\u2019m not going to try and shake people out of it,\u201d confirmed Baxter. \u201cIf people want to hate Saracens and love us I\u2019ll take that every day of the week. If there\u2019s some way we can put in a performance that makes those neutral supporters think about veering our way even more then fantastic.\u201d",
