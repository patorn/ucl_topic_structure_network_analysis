  "body": "EgyptAir flight MS804 debris found The Egyptian military say they have located debris, including \u201cpersonal belongings\u201d, from missing flight MS804 after an intense search by regional navies and surveillance aircraft across the eastern Mediterranean. The announcement corrected earlier reports by the airline that wreckage from the plane had been found near the island of Karpathos. The US has deployed a P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft from a base in Sicily to aid the effort. But Egyptian officials have so far resisted being drawn into speculation on what caused the crash and deaths of all 66 passengers and crew. Still, the country\u2019s aviation minister, Sherif Fathy said, \u201cThe possibility of having a different action or a terror attack is higher than the possibility of having a technical failure.\u201d No terrorist group has yet claimed responsibility.  Greek radar monitoring the flight observed the plane making \u201csudden swerves\u201d, reportedly making a 90-degree turn left, and dropping from 37,000 feet to 15,000 feet before swerving 360 degrees right. The passenger manifest for the Cairo-bound flight included 30 Egyptians, 15 French, two Iraqis, and one person each from the UK, Belgium, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Chad, Portugal, Algeria and Canada.           Missing EgyptAir flight: what we know so far    Egyptian military says it has found debris from EgyptAir flight MS804 Hillary Clinton: \u2018I will be the nominee\u2019 The Democratic frontrunner has expressed confidence that her lead over Bernie Sanders is insurmountable. \u201cI will be the nominee for my party \u2026 That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won\u2019t be,\u201d Clinton told CNN. The Sanders campaign disputed Clinton\u2019s reading, noting that voters in three states, Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon, have disagreed. \u201cWe expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree,\u201d said Sanders campaign manager Michael Briggs. He pointed to polls showing Sanders doing better against Donald Trump than Clinton in a straight match-up. \u201cIt is clear that millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign,\u201d he added. Donald Trump, campaigning in New Jersey with Chris Christie, joked that his potential running mate \u201cis not eating Oreos any more\u201d. The event was scheduled to help the state\u2019s Republican party pay off debts related to Christie\u2019s failed presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton: \u2018I will be the nominee\u2019 of the Democratic party Oklahoma abortion ban A bill that criminalizes abortion providers has been passed by the state\u2019s legislature. Now it heads to Governor Mary Fallin. Should she sign the bill into law, any doctor who performs an abortion \u2013 except to save a woman\u2019s life \u2013 could face three years in prison. Oklahoma currently has just two licensed abortion clinics. Fallin, a potential Trump vice-presidential contender, won\u2019t say if she\u2019s going to sign the bill into law.  Oklahoma legislators pass near-total abortion ban that criminalizes providers San Francisco police chief resigns Police chief Greg Suhr has stepped down hours after officers fatally shot a 27-year-old black woman, the latest incident in a series of fatal police shootings and scandals. The latest fatality came when police fired a single shot at the woman, who was allegedly driving a stolen car and had sped off after being approached by officers. San Francisco, reports the Guardian\u2019s Julia Carrie Wong, is experiencing an ugly collision of police brutality and homelessness. Suhr is one of a growing number of police chiefs to lose their jobs after protests following police shootings. San Francisco police chief resigns in wake of fatal shootings and scandals A wolf to love They\u2019ve got a bad reputation as \u201cthe beast of destruction\u201d, but everyone knows wolves in storybooks are never just wolves. Many species have been eliminated through carelessness but rarely has an animal been wiped out with such a triumphant combination of disgust and fear and as America\u2019s gray wolf. As wolf populations reach new heights in Yellowstone Park, Oliver Milman writes that efforts to save the wolf \u2013 and our perception of them \u2013 should be richly celebrated. Can America learn to love the big bad wolf? There are signs of change Need directions? This cop can\u2019t help The Stanford shopping center in Palo Alto, California, has a new security detail \u2013 an egg-shaped robot. He \u2013 or it \u2013 has high-definition infrared cameras and can process 300 license plates a minute. The inspiration for a robotic security guard was born out of the Sandy Hook elementary school shootings but this early adaptation is thankfully unarmed: it\u2019s having enough problems avoiding pedestrians. The Guardian\u2019s Nicky Woolf watched as it set off on a collision course with one shopper. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Terminator,\u201d the man noted, \u201cand that is some Skynet-ass shit.\u201d RoboCop is real \u2013 and could be patrolling a mall near you Nyquist the favorite for Preakness Is Nyquist, undefeated in eight starts, ready to repeat his Kentucky Derby success? He\u2019s the 3-5 favorite in the field of 11 horses but the going is likely to be soft at Pimlico. Trainer Doug O\u2019Neill said: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to leave there running and just kind of play it by ear,\u201d said O\u2019Neill of the race strategy. \u201cIf they\u2019re not showing a lot of pace, we\u2019re going to make it. If it\u2019s hot and heavy, (jockey) Mario (Gutierrez) has shown and Nyquist has shown that they can sit off a hot and heavy pace.\u201d Preakness Stakes: favorite Nyquist ready to repeat Kentucky Derby success Cannes: revolutionary politics, nudity and paranormal activity The Guardian\u2019s contingent of film critics has delivered its takes on the Cannes film festival. They found, in short: sex, ghosts, money and sainthood. Benjamin Lee writes: \u201cIt has been a bumper year for female protagonists at Cannes, with the majority of in-competition titles led by women. But they\u2019ve not had it easy, mind, with ghosts causing them them all kinds of grief on the Croisette.\u201d Sex, ghosts, money and sainthood \u2013 now playing at Cannes 2016 Beastie Boys\u2019 John Berry dies The Beastie Boys have lost another founding member. Guitarist John Berry was part of the original punk band before it crystalized as a hip-hop three-piece. Berry gave the group, then called the Young Aborigines, their name. He died on Thursday in a hospice in Danvers, Massachusetts, after his frontal lobe dementia condition worsened. Berry left the group shortly after the release of their first EP, Polly Wog Stew, and was replaced by Adam \u201cAd-Rock\u201d Horovitz. During the band\u2019s induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Horovitz recalled how Berry\u2019s father who burst into early rehearsals screaming, \u201cWould you turn that fucking shit off already?\u201d John Berry, founding Beastie Boys member, dies aged 52 And, in case you missed it Britain\u2019s leading ceramicist, Grayson Perry, has unveiled a huge, shiny phallus covered in banknotes and adorned with the image of UK finance chief George Osborne. Perry said his latest pot was inspired by industry\u2019s self-denial about gender bias. His explorations in the realm of bankers revealed a \u201cbastion of male power\u201d despite being \u201cshrouded in politeness and gentrification the higher up you go\u201d. Grayson Perry creates huge phallus to represent bankers\u2019 worldview",
