  "body": "Thelma & Louise, Ridley Scott\u2019s 1991 road-trip classic starring Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon as two empowered outlaws, is widely considered a feminist trailblazer. Its two stars, both nominated for Oscars for their performances, said they never saw it that way. \u201cWhen we were making it, we weren\u2019t making a feminist film \u2013 we were making a buddy film,\u201d Sarandon said, seated next to Davis at the Cannes film festival on Sunday.    Related: Juliette Binoche: I confronted Spielberg and Scorsese over lack of female leads    \u201cNobody making it had any idea that it was going to strike a nerve the way it did,\u201d Davis concurred. \u201cIt caused a big stir that we were totally unprepared for. But it was fun.\u201d The pair were reunited in Cannes on the film\u2019s 25th anniversary for a discussion in the Majestic hotel\u2019s roof garden. The talk was part of the Kering Women in Motion series held for the length of the festival. Thelma & Louise proved a watershed moment for women in Hollywood by being a Oscar-nominated hit written by a woman, Callie Khouri, and headlined by two female actors. But as Davis and Sarandon both lamented, it didn\u2019t revolutionise the film industry. A recent study by the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School of Journalism, found that in the most popular films of 2007 to 2014, women had less than a third of speaking parts.  Sarandon thinks Hollywood has only got worse for women. Asked by Variety\u2019s Ramin Setoodeh, the event\u2019s moderator, if Thelma & Louise could be commissioned by a major corporate studio today, Sarandon scoffed: \u201cMaybe as an animation.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the studios have had an epiphany about women in film, because after Thelma & Louise, it didn\u2019t happen. And that movie made a lot of fucking money.\u201d Davis added: \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the really uncomfortable things, because when they said that, I believed it. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Davis, who heads the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, an organisation dedicated to improving gender balance in the entertainment industry, however, expressed hope.

The next movie somebody makes can be gender balanced. We don\u2019t have to sneak up on it, just do it.\u201d Sarandon blamed the lack of roles for women in mainstream film on the \u201cmale executives making these decisions\u201d.  She added: \u201cHollywood has become more and more corporate and \u2026 the kind of people making those decisions and the basis on which they\u2019re making those decisions. Whereas women can see a woman or a man in a leading role, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as easy for a guy to see a woman in a leading role and say: \u2018I\u2019ll get behind that.\u2019 \u201cI think it\u2019s a cultural thing, and that\u2019s part of what slows it down: a lack of imagination on the part of men.\u201d \u201cHollywood isn\u2019t political,\u201d she added. \u201cThey just go with the money.\u201d     Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis accepting their awards at the Women in Motion ceremony in Cannes. Photograph: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images for Kering    On the topic of equal pay, an issue recently brought to the forefront by Patricia Arquette\u2019s Oscar acceptance speech for Boyhood and Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s open letter about being paid less than her male co-stars on American Hustle, Sarandon conceded that actors are paid a \u201cpreposterous amount\u201d, but added: \u201cwhy should we not be paid as preposterously as men?    Related: Susan Sarandon blasts Woody Allen and Donald Trump at Cannes    \u201cComparing what mega stars make when half the world is starving doesn\u2019t mean you should be ashamed of making that much money. It\u2019s about respect \u2013 it\u2019s not about the money.\u201d And although Sarandon acknowledged that Hollywood caters to male actors, she also said that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t take a lot of the parts men are taking.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about quality,\u201d Sarandon argued. \u201cMy time is precious.\u201d She echoed those sentiments several hours later, at Cannes\u2019 annual presidential dinner, hosted by the festival and Kering, where she and Davis were honoured for their contribution to film and women\u2019s rights. \u201cAs we have more and more power in this particular industry, it\u2019s important that we remember to have more fun than the guys are having,\u201d Sarandon said, in accepting her Women in Motion award alongside Davis. \u201cWe want things that we feel passionate about. We want to tell stories about connection, about love, something that encourages people to be the protagonist in their own lives, something that is moving, something that is really feminine, something that is special.\u201d Davis used the podium to call on Hollywood to give female audiences more of a reason to go to the cinema: \u201cOne of the best aspects of watching a movie, is identifying with the characters. If we\u2019re not giving women that opportunity, we\u2019re robbing them of one of the best parts of seeing a movie.\u201d",
