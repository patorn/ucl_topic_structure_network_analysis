  "body": "It began, as these things sometimes do, with a stink. On the evening of 15 July 1895, in Plaistow, east London, a girl arrived at the house of Emily Coombes, sent by her mother, who\u2019d noticed a rank smell at the home of Coombes\u2019s sister-in-law, nearby in Cave Road. Two\u00a0days later, on the morning of 17 July, the milkman also encountered a stench at the house in Cave Road, and again word was sent to Emily Coombes. At 1.20pm on the same day, accompanied by her friend, Mary Burrage, she knocked on the door of the terraced house, demanding that her nephew, 13-year-old Robert, open it. Pushing past him, she went upstairs, following her instincts and, presumably, her nose. There in the bedroom, she found the body of a woman, her face covered by a sheet and a pillow. Sister-in-law Emily was unrecognisable. She had been there a while, and the weather had been hot. The corpse was all maggots. There was, and is, no mystery attached to Emily Coombes\u2019s unfortunate end. Her son Robert immediately and almost nonchalantly confessed to having stabbed her 10 days before. Having committed this heinous act, moreover, he and his little brother Nattie had enjoyed themselves mightily (their father was away at sea). They had been to see WG Grace play cricket at Lord\u2019s, and to the seaside. By way of money, they\u2019d pawned various bits and pieces, aided by an adult family friend called John Fox, whom they\u2019d asked to stay while their mother was supposedly away in Liverpool. (\u201cWe\u2019ve had a rich uncle die in Africa,\u201d they said, \u201cand Auntie wants to see Ma.\u201d) Fox had not noticed the stink, or so he said. \u201cMy smell is not very good,\u201d he told the police. At this point, I pictured him sniffing the air, experimentally.   Related: A life in writing: Kate Summerscale    Why had Robert killed his mother? He spoke of the beatings she\u2019d dished out, of the need to defend Nattie. However, as Kate Summerscale notes in this account of his crime and its aftermath, it seems more likely that he had suffered some kind of psychotic breakdown. The newspapers of the day, high on fin-de-si\u00e8cle fear and loathing \u2013 in the 1890s, children were no longer innocents; they were little beasts, capable of all sorts of savage doings \u2013 thought him a \u201cmonster of depravity\u201d. But the jury at his trial for murder, gazing on his confident but undeniably young face in the dock, took a more compassionate view, and thanks to them, he was not hanged, but dispatched to Broadmoor, where he took part in chess tournaments and learned to play the violin and cornet. Seventeen years later, when he was 30, he was thought well enough to be released, and with a small inheritance from his father, he travelled to Australia to make a new life. Redemption comes twice in this account. At Gallipoli and the Somme, Coombes served with distinction as a stretcher bearer; and then, a little later, there came another beautiful paying off of debts, an extremely touching twist, the nature of which I won\u2019t give away here. I must be honest. My feelings about The Wicked Boy \u2013 unexpectedly, given my deep and abiding admiration for its author\u2019s last book \u2013 are mixed. If the salvation of Robert is wondrous in a human sense, in narrative terms it is nothing short of a miracle, for without it, Summerscale would, I think, have struggled to make his story work between hard covers. I wonder, though. Is this coda really enough? Does it reshape, in the mind of the reader, the first half of The Wicked Boy, absolving it of its faults?    Fans of Victorian true crime will certainly enjoy Summerscale\u2019s scrupulous account of Coombes\u2019s trial    I\u2019m not sure that it does. Although there are moments when events spring vividly to life \u2013 impossible to forget the sad, disturbing letter Coombes sent while he was on remand, in which he drew pictures of the gallows and gave away an imaginary fortune \u2013 most of the time, our wicked boy is little more than a cipher, an outline rather than a fully fleshed character. Of course, Summerscale has painfully little to go on, and just as she did in Mrs Robinson\u2019s Disgrace and The Suspicions of Mr Whicher before it, she plugs the gaps, not with silly imaginings (like mine of Fox\u2019s sniffing), but with as much background as she can find, carefully building a picture of Victorian mores in the process. In this book, however, her research feels curiously uneven, and sometimes a touch bolted on. She tells us, for instance, all about a curate at Coombes\u2019s local church \u2013 the profession of his father, the epiphany he had aged 10 \u2013 yet Richard Dadd, the great Victorian painter of fairies whose long incarcerations first in Bethlem and then in Broadmoor resulted in some of the most singular works in the Tate\u2019s collection, is referred to only as \u201ca patricide who decorated the asylum hall with a series of fantastical murals\u201d. Her examination of the \u201cpenny dreadfuls\u201d Coombes loved to read \u2013 cheap adventure stories for boys that some thought filled their heads with dubious cravings \u2013 is excellent as far as it goes. But it also seems beside the point, somehow. Even the raciest tale of derring-do \u2013 silly stuff by our standards \u2013 can have had nothing to do with what Robert Coombes did that summer. Fans of Victorian true crime will certainly enjoy Summerscale\u2019s scrupulous and occasionally startling account of Coombes\u2019s trial. I did myself at times. But those who want something richer \u2013 a world in microcosm \u2013 may find The Wicked Boy just a little slight. This is a furrow she has already ploughed more deftly\u00a0elsewhere.
