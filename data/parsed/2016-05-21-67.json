  "body": "Stewart Regan, the chief executive of the Scottish FA, has said he was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the scenes that marred the conclusion of the country\u2019s Cup final.   Related: Hibernian and David Gray stun Rangers to make Scottish Cup history    After Hibernian\u2019s stoppage-time winner in a 3-2 win over Rangers, making their first Scottish Cup triumph since 1902, thousands of the Edinburgh club\u2019s fans invaded the pitch. Those who goaded the Rangers support were involved in on-field brawls and the Ibrox club claimed that several of their players and staff were also assaulted. Rangers did not receive their runners-up medals in public. Hibs were denied what would have been a traditional lap of honour after police horses had been utilised to clear the pitch. \u201cIt was truly shocking, appalling,\u201d said Regan. \u201cWhen you have 20,000 [Hibs] fans and some come on to the pitch, it is very difficult to stop the sheer numbers. What should have been an historic, memorable Scottish Cup final will now, sadly, be remembered for all the wrong reasons.\u201d     Fans clash on the Hampden Park pitch. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images    Regan, who will instigate a full investigation, confirmed the final had been placed at the SFA\u2019s highest possible security level, with more than 1,000 police officers and stewards deployed at the national stadium. Ch Supt Kenny MacDonald said: \u201cWe understand that feelings run high at these events and fans want to celebrate their team\u2019s win, however the reckless behaviour of fans entering the pitch is totally unacceptable and inexcusable. This created a significant safety issue. \u201cThis action led to an outbreak of disorder between rival fans on the pitch. A dedicated investigation team is being set up to identify those who have carried out these acts of disorder and violence.\u201d In a statement, Rangers said: \u201cRangers players and staff were assaulted by these fans who invaded the pitch and in the interests of their safety could not return to the pitch for the medal presentation. \u201cThere can be no place for the violent behaviour witnessed at the end of the final and Rangers fully expect the Scottish Football Association and Police Scotland to launch an investigation to find out where security measures failed.\u201d Alan Stubbs, the Hibs manager, said: \u201cI wish all the fans had left the pitch so we could celebrate it properly. Everyone\u2019s safety is the most important thing. I can understand the euphoria that surrounded it. I don\u2019t condone it, but I understand it.\u201d",
