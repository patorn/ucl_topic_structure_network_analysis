Related: Premier League: 10 talking points from (almost) the final day of the season    The Spurs striker beat Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Leicester City\u2019s Jamie Vardy to the award after scoring 25 goals in 28 appearances. But it provided little consolation in the wake of his team\u2019s end-of-season collapse, emphasised by Tottenham\u2019s 5-1 capitulation at relegated Newcastle United on Sunday. Despite being badly out of sorts since missing out on the title to Leicester, Tottenham required only a point at St James\u2019 Park to secure second position. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably the worst performance I\u2019ve ever been involved with,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWe still had a lot to play for, so it\u2019s hard to put a finger on what went wrong. We just haven\u2019t been good enough in the last few games \u2013 it\u2019s not just Newcastle, we should never have lost to Southampton either. It probably started from drawing the West Brom game, but it\u2019s hard to say exactly what went wrong. \u201cIt would have been nicer to have won the Golden Boot on a better day, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s a personal achievement and it\u2019s something I\u2019m proud of but if I had the choice between winning or having the Golden Boot, I\u2019d rather have won. For me, it\u2019s a little bit of a good feeling but overall I\u2019m gutted we haven\u2019t finished the season off strong.\u201d Or bettered Arsenal for the first time since 1995. \u201cThat definitely makes it harder because we know how much it means to the fans and how much it means to the club,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWhen people think Arsenal had a bad season and we\u2019ve had a good one, yet they still finish above us, it hurts.

I think that\u2019s two points from the last four games and that\u2019s unacceptable considering how we played the rest of the season. All we can do is apologise to the fans. We have to stick together through tough times \u2013 and we\u2019re still playing Champions League football.\u201d The prospect of potential trips to Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid next season certainly helps soothe the pain of Tottenham\u2019s surrender. \u201cWhat\u2019s just happened hurts and it\u2019ll leave a bad taste in the mouth over the summer,\u201d Kane said. \u201cBut in hindsight, you\u2019ve got to try to look at the bigger picture. If someone had offered us automatic Champions League at the start of the season, we would definitely have taken it. It\u2019s just a shame the way it ended.\u201d It seems Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s players could never quite cope with the disappointment of losing out to Leicester for English football\u2019s biggest prize but now the challenge is to win the title next season. Kane said: \u201cWe\u2019re professionals and we wanted it to be us lifting the league. We have to use that as motivation for next year. It\u2019s going to be another tough season. It\u2019ll be a long old year but we have to cope with that at the top level if we want to be fighting for the Premier League again.

We have to learn from it. We have to learn how to finish teams off and finish the season off as well. If we had been still in the title run-in and this had happened at Newcastle, we\u2019d have been even more gutted. If it had come down to the last day and something like this happened it would be even more hurtful. We just have to learn from it. \u201cGames like Newcastle and the last few weeks show there\u2019s still a lot of work to do. We haven\u2019t cracked it yet. We\u2019re still learning, we still have to work hard and we still have to improve. \u201cBut everything is in place so we all have to try to stay positive \u2013 us, the fans, the club \u2013 because we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d",
