  "body": "Ted Cruz made a last-ditch series of attacks on Donald Trump on Sunday, going so far as to call him corrupt, dismiss fellow Republicans, and invoke Trump\u2019s endorsement by \u201ca convicted rapist\u201d as he argued that his chances are not in fact dwindling in the Republican presidential primary. Cruz blitzed television airwaves on Sunday morning, making appearances on five talkshows and doing everything in his power to undermine Trump. He admitted Indiana was \u201cimportant\u201d to his campaign\u2019s hopes, but doggedly refused to consider the possibility that Trump could secure the nomination.   Related: Indiana is the only place that can save the GOP from a Trump takeover    \u201cNo one is going to clinch it on the first ballot. I\u2019m not and Donald Trump is not either,\u201d he told the ABC show This Week. \u201cIt\u2019s why Donald Trump is so desperate to say it\u2019s over now,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a contested convention.\u201d But a new opinion poll published on Sunday suggested Cruz is the candidate in dire need of a boost. The NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll showed him behind Trump in Indiana by 15 points, 49% to 34%, with 13% for Ohio governor John Kasich, the third candidate in the race. Poll averages show Trump ahead of Cruz by seven points in the state, which is one of the few yet to vote that could keep Trump from clinching the nomination. The stakes are high for Cruz. The senator is already mathematically unable to secure 1,237 delegates needed on the first ballot of the Republican convention, and all his hopes rest on preventing Trump from doing the same. Trump needs 282 pledged delegates, and Indiana and California are the two major states where Cruz has any hope of a major victory. The math did not deter Cruz from trying every rhetorical tool at hand to counter Trump. He insisted that the businessman is a liberal, and \u201cflip-sides of the same coin\u201d with the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Trump\u2019s tariff proposals would \u201cdrive jobs overseas\u201d, Cruz argued to NBC, adding that Trump\u2019s foreign policy would leave the world without leadership. Not content to criticize the substance of Trump\u2019s ideas, he accused Trump and Clinton of being agents of a corrupt system. \u201cThey\u2019ve both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. On two other shows, he called the pair \u201cenmeshed in corruption\u201d, \u201cultimate Washington insiders\u201d and members of a political \u201ccartel\u201d.  He also abandoned the appeals to unity that he had tried to make in hopes of bringing moderate conservatives to his cause. He pointedly dismissed criticisms from other Republicans, namely from John Boehner, a longtime Republican leader and former speaker of the House, who earlier this week said Cruz was \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d. \u201cI kind of wondered if Boehner was auditioning to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice-president,\u201d Cruz told CBS. \u201cYou know, a Trump-Boehner ticket would really say the Washington cartel in all its force.\u201d He was bolstered by at least one peer, however: South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who readily admitted that \u201ccivil war\u201d had broken out in the Republican party. \u201cLucifer may be the only person Donald Trump could beat in a general election,\u201d he joked to CBS. \u201cBut when it comes women and Hispanics, Trump polls like Lucifer.\u201d But Graham grew serious when asked about Trump\u2019s foreign policy, which he described as dangerous isolationism: \u201cIt will lead to another 9/11.\u201d  Finally, Cruz rebuked the businessman for the company he keeps. He noted that former boxer Mike Tyson had endorsed Trump this week, and alluded to Tyson\u2019s 1992 rape conviction in Indiana.   \u201cYou know, all the tough guys endorse me,\u201d Trump said earlier this week. \u201cI like that.\u201d Cruz rejected the endorsement: \u201cI don\u2019t think rapists are tough guys. I think they are weak. They\u2019re bullies and cowards.  \u201cWe don\u2019t need a bully,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t need someone who yells and screams and insults.\u201d  Campaigning in Indiana, Trump waved off the criticisms as annoyances, and mocked the men and Kasich at length.  \u201cI refuse to call them the leftovers. It\u2019s not respectful,\u201d he said, before miming the look of a man clinging to the edge of a cliff. \u201cThe two guys that are hanging by their fingernails. \u2018Don\u2019t let me fall! Don\u2019t let me fall!\u2019\u201d At a rally in Terre Haute, he said that he was already looking forward to the general election. \u201cIf we win in Indiana, it\u2019s all over,\u201d he promised. \u201cAnd then we can focus on \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019, please.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump did just that, telling Fox News Sunday that Clinton was playing \u201cthe woman card\u201d and that \u201ceven women don\u2019t like her\u201d. He has for months accused Clinton of being a novelty candidate, although polling consistently shows that he is strongly disliked by most American women. And although Cruz recited a litany of attacks on Trump, he refused to say he would not support the businessman should Trump win the nomination. NBC host Chuck Todd asked Cruz nine times whether he could conceivably support Trump. The senator spoke at length in reply, but did not give a simple yes or no.",
