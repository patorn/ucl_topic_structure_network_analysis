  "body": "Touts and others who sell large numbers of tickets to concerts and other events at inflated prices may have to be officially licensed if laws on resales continue to be flouted, a government-commissioned review has suggested. It has also recommended that secondary-ticketing websites \u2013 a sector dominated by Seatwave, Viagogo, Get Me In and StubHub \u2013 should be taken to court if they do not comply with rules brought in last year to protect consumers. In the wake of a growing outcry over the reselling of tickets at vastly inflated prices, the government announced an independent review of how the secondary-ticketing market is working.  For Radiohead\u2019s London show on 26 May, \u00a365 tickets are being offered for sale on Viagogo for \u00a33,900, while in February it emerged that seats at Adele\u2019s London shows were being offered for up to \u00a324,000 each.  The review panel, chaired by Professor Michael Waterson, has now published its conclusions and recommendations.  The rules introduced in 2015 require anyone reselling tickets via a secondary-ticketing website to provide details of the block, row and, crucially, seat number, as well as the face value and information about any restrictions.  But campaigners and consumer bodies such as Which? claim the websites are failing to ensure that the required information is provided when people list tickets for sale. The review states that at the moment, the secondary-ticketing sites \u201care seemingly falling short\u201d when it comes to ensuring compliance with the provisions in the act. It is recommending that a lead body, such as National Trading Standards, \u201cshould carry out a concerted investigation of compliance, followed by action coordinated with the police\u201d.  It is also recommending that enforcement action and, if necessary, court proceedings be taken where rule breaches are found to have taken place, and that the websites need to take more responsibility and undertake better checks to identify traders, as opposed to ordinary members of the public using the sites to sell the odd spare ticket. The review states that if within a reasonable time, no progress has been made by the secondary sites on compliance and the identification of traders, the government should consider \u201calternative approaches\u201d, which might include a requirement that those selling more than a certain number of tickets be licensed by an official body. Ticket brokers are required to be licensed or registered in a number of US states, and the review says: \u201cThis is a model the government may wish to consider for the UK if a licensing regime proves necessary to protect consumers and public trust in secondary ticketing.\u201d",
