The writing on that encouraged me to keep talking about celebrity culture in a smart way and feel like eventually I\u2019d find an audience. The funniest book I\u2019ve ever read Sara Pascoe\u2019s Animal: The Autobiography Of A Female Body. It\u2019s vulnerable and reflective and will have you crying with laughter on the train. Sara is my friend and my hero and the genius voice of our generation. The thing that I am most grateful for in my life is that my young daughter has access to her.

The funniest person I know All my friends are funny, but I can\u2019t even look at Joe Lycett without laughing. If I was dying, I would want Joe to break the news to me. Because I would find it hilarious. The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had  I was talking about Canada and a man shouted out that he\u2019d been to Alberta to repair trucks. We had a chat about that and moved on. Forty minutes later, as I was wrapping up, he yelled \u201cBut what about the trucks?!\u201d Obviously he\u2019d expected that some meta-narrative about trucking would\u2019ve materialised by now to eclipse the show. It hadn\u2019t. The funniest word Garbage. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had I cut all my hair off the same year I got braces, almost like some form of protest against dating. My dad loved it. The funniest sketch I\u2019ve ever seen A friend showed me clips of a New York collective called Three Busy Debras recently and it left me both captivated and terrified. Also, Rose Matafeo works on a New Zealand show called Funny Girls and you can find their sketch Career Girl online. It\u2019s an advert for a board game aimed at girls with job ambitions. That\u2019s my favourite one right now.            Katherine Ryan plays Hammersmith Apollo, W6, Saturday",
