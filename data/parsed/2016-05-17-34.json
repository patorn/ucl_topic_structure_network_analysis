  "body": "\u2022 Because of an editing error, an article (Labour and Plaid Cymru stalemate over choice to lead Welsh assembly, 12\u00a0May, page 4) said that the Tories and Ukip had taken seats from Labour in \u201cthe recent local elections\u201d. We meant the Welsh assembly elections, not local (council) elections. The only change from Labour\u2019s 2011 seat tally was due to the loss of one constituency seat to Plaid Cymru. In the regional lists, Ukip won seven seats at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems. \u2022 An interview with Geri Horner said the former Spice Girl had \u201cjust finished reading A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara, the novel that won the 2015 Man Booker\u201d. The novel was only shortlisted for the prize, which went to Marlon James for A Brief History of Seven Killings (\u2018I like myself a bit better now\u2019, 16\u00a0May, page 12, G2). \u2022 An article about movie roles for black women referred to \u201cTodd Haynes\u2019s All That Heaven Allows\u201d. The writer meant to refer to Haynes\u2019s film Far from Heaven. It was inspired by Douglas Sirk\u2019s 1955 film All That Heaven Allows (In full colour, 13 May, page 14, G2). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Israel: \u2018Some NGOs are seen as the enemy from the inside\u2019",
