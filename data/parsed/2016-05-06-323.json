You are the heirs to a struggle for freedom.\u201d With those words, in a speech given in Hanover at the end of his European tour, Barack Obama did what no European leader has ventured to do in a long time, which is to give an \u201caddress to the people of Europe\u201d. That choice of the singular form, \u201cpeople of Europe\u201d and not \u201cpeoples\u201d, was the most striking part of Obama\u2019s message. It ran counter to Europe\u2019s growing populism; the self-glorification of national egos, the distrust towards outsiders, and the reflex of putting up walls or closing down borders. The president was deliberate and specific. \u201cThe people of Europe, hundreds of millions of citizens \u2013 east, west, north, south \u2013 are more secure and more prosperous because we stood together for the ideals we share,\u201d he said. To refer so pointedly to Europeans as one single people seems counterintuitive. Not only that, it might even backfire. Brexiters and other anti-EU activists will pounce on it as vindication of all their warnings about an EU ready to deprive nations of their separate identities and to place them under one towering authority. So what was Obama thinking as he spoke in a way that was surely designed to provoke reflection, and how might Europeans dwell on his words?    For many, especially among young generations, the peace imperative has worn thin    This was a speech meant to boost a much-diminished sense of European self-confidence. Obama listed accomplishments that most European leaders find hard to recall these days: how postwar Europe \u201crose above old divisions and put [itself] on the path to union\u201d, how the heroism of the Poles of Solidarity and other central Europeans helped bring down the iron curtain. Resilience to terrorism was even brought into the mix, with references to how European capitals \u201crefused to give in to fear\u201d when bombs went off. You should be proud, he said: \u201cPeople starved on this continent. Families were separated on this continent. And now people desperately want to come here precisely because of what you\u2019ve created. You can\u2019t take that for granted.\u201d But none of this quite defined that supposedly unique entity, the \u201cpeople of Europe\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s no surprise because the European project itself has long struggled with the notion. EU texts don\u2019t even go so far as speaking of a single \u201cpeople of Europe\u201d. Article 1 of the EU treaty mentions an \u201cever closer union among the peoples of Europe\u201d \u2013 note the plural, \u201cpeoples\u201d. For the past 60 years, the main goals set for European cooperation have been peace, prosperity and power. For many, especially among young generations, the peace motif, decisive in the post-1945 period, has worn thin \u2013 even as war returned to the continent in 2014 (in Ukraine). Globalisation has fed resentment against inequalities and elites. And the EU is struggling to convince citizens that it can find pragmatic solutions to concrete problems, as shown by its difficulties in the refugee crisis.   Related: The Guardian view on Obama\u2019s Hanover speech: a welcome endorsement of European unity and values | Editorial    Obama\u2019s speech tried to point to something we Europeans now tend to discard as an overly idealistic vision. Yet there have been numerous \u2013 if tentative \u2013 attempts to forge that common sense of European belonging, and this is a good occasion to recall them. In his book, Passage to Europe, the Dutch political analyst Luuk van Middelaar usefully runs through many of those episodes. For example, does anyone remember that when the Maastricht treaty came into force in 1993, hundreds of millions became \u201ccitizens of the union\u201d? Initially, the European project rested on a vague recollection of the medieval Carolingian past: the six founding nations had after all been part of Charlemagne\u2019s empire. That changed after 1973, when the UK, Ireland and Denmark joined. The need to find other references led to a \u201cdeclaration on European identity\u201d. European unity, it said, was about overcoming ancient enmities, about \u201cdiversity of cultures\u201d within \u201ccommon values and principles\u201d and an \u201cincreasing convergence of attitudes to life\u201d.

There was no rush, among European leaders at the time, to let into their midst 10 poor, weakened peoples. Yet there was no other choice but to welcome them in \u2013 an indispensable step towards European reunification. After the 2004 enlargement, for the first time, Europe\u2019s geographic dimensions started fitting more comfortably with its name. Today, identity politics are back with a vengeance, as the British referendum debate shows, and as other developments have illustrated, from Hungary to the Netherlands, where the far right is on the ascendency. The EU may have retained its own flag (officially called a \u201clogo\u201d when it was adopted in 1986) and it has an anthem (Ode to Joy, from Beethoven\u2019s Ninth symphony \u2013 with the words \u201call men will be brothers\u201d) but the idea that a single European culture can be the bearer of a single political order is overwhelmingly resisted. This is not a new phenomenon, but now seems more pronounced. The truth is, European governments have never fundamentally wanted their citizens to think of themselves as genuinely European citizens. EU institutions are by no means flawless, but they have also been a handy punch bag for national politicians wanting to deflect criticism from their own failings.

When Europeans travel to America, Asia or Africa, many intuitively do feel European. Tourists recognise this. But when returning back home, to Paris or London or Warsaw, that feeling somehow evaporates and we quickly plunge back into nationally framed debates and differences. So it can take an outsider, Barack Obama, to remind us of how the quest for freedom and democracy sits at the heart of European endeavours. That Greeks have been critical of the eurozone\u2019s governance is one thing, but that didn\u2019t mean they preferred to leave the euro, nor the EU. Greece\u2019s just as Spain\u2019s and Portugal\u2019s memberships have been instrumental in harnessing parliamentary democracy: it\u2019s the core reason these countries, which had all known dictatorship, knocked on the European door in the first place. As Van Middelaar points out, European identity is a thin membrane, difficult to capture in words. It stands somewhere between plurality on the inside and a claim to universalism\u00a0towards the outside world. It\u2019s because Europeans find themselves collectively confronted with a changing global landscape, and chaos threatening to spill over from the outside, that it can only make sense to try to stick together. Turning a continent into a union has always been a difficult task, fraught with tensions and setbacks, and today\u2019s crises don\u2019t make it easier. Perhaps Obama\u2019s speech said as much about the degree of concern in Washington over Europe\u2019s state of affairs as it did about what should hold Europe together. The EU is a unique construct, neither a federation nor a purely intergovernmental organisation. Speaking of the \u201cAmerican people\u201d is a given, but no one would seriously think of speaking of the \u201cpeople of Asean\u201d or \u201cthe people of Mercosur\u201d. The EU might now be a loveless union, but if an American president thinks the \u201cpeople of Europe\u201d do exist, why can\u2019t we see the advantage of that?",
