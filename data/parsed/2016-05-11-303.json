  "body": "Among the Panama Papers \u2013 11.5m documents that comprised the biggest data leak in history \u2013 were details of enough privately collected Monets, Picassos and Hirsts to fill a museum. But these were not the Panama Paintings exhibited at Neu West Berlin last week. Instead, the gallery has been showcasing what London-based German artist Philipp Ackermann calls his \u201coffshore paintings\u201d.   Related: How offshore firm helped billionaire change the art world for ever    If it wasn\u2019t for the media frenzy surrounding the Panama Papers, the show would never have come about. It all started when Neu West Berlin\u2019s curator, Matthias Crause, invited Ackermann to exhibit at short notice. With less than two months to put together a show, Ackermann employed a time-saving concept he had used before. He asked the curator to play artist\u2019s assistant and paint a copy of one of his paintings to show in the exhibition. But Crause didn\u2019t paint a thing. Instead, he asked Galician painter Daniel de Isabel to make the copies. Crause calls the concept \u201cpainting with an invisible hand\u201d \u2013 Ackermann gave De Isabel instructions on how to make the works via phone and email, directing the exhibition from his London studio to ape the degrees of remove involved in the offshore dealings exposed by the Panama leak. The concept is based on political philosopher Robert Nozick\u2019s theory of the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d or in Ackermann\u2019s words \u201corders that give the impression they\u2019ve been created by a central authority\u201d. The only thing the artist is evading here is paintbrush-to-canvas elbow grease and maybe some shipping costs. Still, the aim was to make the paintings look like what Crause calls \u201can offshore, undercover business\u201d. It\u2019s not a new idea in art either \u2013 a parallel can be drawn to Lieber Maler male mir (\u201cDear painter, paint for me\u201d), in which German artist Martin Kippenberger contracted colleagues to paint works on his behalf. \u201cHe used a multitude of strategies to obtain the highest possible profit from his ideas, though not necessarily financially,\u201d says Ackermann of the earlier project.  As for De Isabel\u2019s copies, the samples were \u201cvery convincing\u201d and Ackermann believes he picked the \u201cright person for this job\u201d. The exhibition\u2019s title is knowingly promotional. \u201cThe hype which the media has created around [the leak] seems like a piece of art to me,\u201d says Ackermann. \u201cThe Panama Papers name is an accomplishment in itself.\u201d   Related: Mossack Fonseca's role in fight over painting stolen by Nazis    Among the artworks on show is an abstracted interpretation of Seated Man With a Cane, a 1918 painting by Amedeo Modigliani, which is worth \u00a318m and was the subject of a legal dispute between a New York art gallery and the heir of an art dealer who fled the Nazi regime during the second world war.  Ackermann made the abstract version of the Modigliani and painted a version of it in oils, from memory, before De Isabel reproduced it. Visitors walking in wouldn\u2019t know the Ackermann from the De Isabel. The gallery becomes a shell company of sorts for shady dealings.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re contracting someone else to make the paintings, authorship and copyright come into play,\u201d says Crause. \u201cIt\u2019s an intervention, not just an exhibition.\u201d The Panama Paintings are not only symbolic of the scandal, but of wider corruption in the art market. \u201cMoney laundering in the art world is everywhere, but without the scandals. Where does the money go? Where is the ownership? It\u2019s this behind-the-curtains process with rich people.\u201d Even in a show that uses the Panama Papers as a starting point, some details remain hidden. Ackermann\u2019s works are valued upwards of \u00a31,600, but where will the money go if they sell? \u201cThat\u2019s yet to be decided,\u201d says the artist.",
