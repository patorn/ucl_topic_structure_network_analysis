  "body": "The reaction to the wonderful achievement of Leicester City in winning the Premier League is also a sad reflection on the ever-increasing inequality in our society. Nearly 40 years ago my team, Nottingham Forest, came up from the second division with one of the worst promotion records in history and proceeded to win the league, beating, among others, possibly the best\u00a0Liverpool team ever. They then won the European Cup twice. As Leicester were already playing in the top league and had finished the previous season with a terrific burst of form, it is debatable which is the more amazing achievement. However, the depth of reaction to the two events is very instructive. In those days, you could quite easily accept that a \u201clesser\u201d team had some chance of competing against the accepted giants, and Forest\u2019s wins still had a relatively healthy sense of perspective. But now, we hear that Leicester\u2019s performance is \u201cthe greatest ever in sporting history\u201d, presumably in view of the odds against overcoming the colossal inequalities that have been allowed to develop in football. Football \u2013 as ever, a microcosm of the wider world.Jan WiczkowskiPrestwich, Greater Manchester \u2022 Your mountains of deserved praise for Leicester City\u2019s Premier League title omit one small fact that helps reflect the scale of the achievement. In the Guardian\u2019s preview for this season back in August, nine from 11 of your journalists predicted relegation for the new champions. Yes, they really were that far under the radar.Ian CroftLeicester \u2022 I understand that the Leicester City football club have come top of some football league or other. I do think you should have celebrated this achievement. Only 11 pages in the sports section and one full page in the news section hardly seems adequate. What will you do if they win the Champion\u2019s League \u2013 bring out a special edition? And yes, I am a Tottenham Hotspur fan. Mike CantorLondon \u2022 What\u2019s the betting that Cameron now remembers that he didn\u2019t support Aston Villa or West Ham at all, in fact he\u2019s always been a staunch Leicester fan?Phil ElsdonDurham  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
