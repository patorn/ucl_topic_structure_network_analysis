Reedie, under close scrutiny since athletics was plunged into crisis by evidence of systemic Russian doping, has for the first time made specific proposals for vastly increasing Wada\u2019s income outside its current funding model. In an article for theguardian.com, Reedie said that, while Wada could be proud of how far it had come since its formation in 1999, it was time for a step change. He suggested that sponsors should write a clause into the contracts of athletes they back that would divert endorsement fees into the fight against doping if they were found cheating. Reedie, an International Olympic Committee vice-president, also endorsed another idea that has been intermittently proposed by Wada executives but has gained traction in recent months as the scale of the global challenge has again become clear. Noting that the revenue from global broadcasting rights is estimated at $35bn per annum, Reedie suggested a levy on each deal to boost Wada\u2019s existing $30m-a-year budget. \u201cTo impose, for example, a 0.5% tariff on this $35bn annual media rights figure would instantly put $175m more in the anti-doping coffers, increasing Wada\u2019s budget five-fold,\u201d he said. \u201cWith such extra funds we could make a greater impact in protecting the rights of the clean athletes and in turn uphold the integrity of sport.\u201d Reedie said sponsors should take more responsibility for the fight against doping. Huge sportswear companies such as Nike have come under particular scrutiny for continuing to endorse athletes even after they have been banned. \u201cSponsorship is also an enormous contributor to the sport industry. Major sports sponsors should start to look at how they might support clean sport,\u201d he said. \u201cTake pharmaceutical companies, for example, with whom the anti-doping movement has strong relations. While anti-doping has an interest in protecting the rights of the clean athlete, the pharmaceutical industry has a significant stake in ensuring that its products are being used for legitimate medical reasons, not abused by athletes seeking an edge.\u201d There is widespread acceptance that Wada needs more funds if it is to conduct more proactive investigations of the kind led by an independent commission chaired by Dick Pound that uncovered widespread systemic doping in Russia. However, others in the anti-doping world argue that Wada has become too bureaucratic and beholden to its paymasters and must prove first it is capable of spending additional funds wisely. Reedie argued that Wada has been doing its bit to increase funding \u2013 establishing a new $12m fund to research new testing methods and receiving an encouraging response to a recent plea to fund more investigations in the mould of Pound\u2019s \u2013 but that other stakeholders must now do the same. Wada\u2019s current $30m funding is provided equally 50-50 by the IOC and national governments. \u201cWe need to rally all sport\u2019s stakeholders \u2013 including broadcasters and sponsors \u2013 to the clean sport cause,\u201d Reedie said. \u201cPublic opinion is also firmly in favour of a level playing field and so we all have a duty to protect the clean athletes and ensure the fairest, most efficient system possible is in place for athletes across the world. Sport, government, athletes, broadcasters and sponsors alike share this important duty.\u201d The International Association of Athletics Federations and its under-pressure president, Sebastian Coe, will decide on 17 June whether to allow Russia back into the sport before the Rio Olympics, in what will be a pivotal moment. The Norwegian anti-doping expert Rune Andersen has been leading an independent task force to assess whether Russia has complied with a list of requirements set down by Wada. Despite Pound warning last week it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d to trust that Russian athletes competing at the Games were clean, the IOC president Thomas Bach is believed to be lobbying hard for the IAAF to allow them to return. \u201cThere will be a lot pressure to get them back in and from a system point of view, it would be nice to have everybody at the Games,\u201d Pound said. \u201cBut whether that makes sense in terms of the changes they\u2019ve made remains to be seen. I think there\u2019s still some elements of denial [in Russia].\u201d",
