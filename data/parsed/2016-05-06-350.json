  "body": "Labour\u2019s Chris Elmore has won the byelection in the south Wales seat of Ogmore \u2013 traditionally a safe seat for the party \u2013 with a majority of over 8,000. Turnout was 43%. Ukip\u2019s Glenda Davies finished in second place, with 3,808 votes, and Plaid Cymru\u2019s Abi Thomas was third with 3,683 votes. The Conservatives\u2019 Alex Williams received 2,956 votes, while Janet Ellard for the Liberal Democrats received 702 votes. Elmore, 32, a former butcher\u2019s apprentice, has been a councillor for the past eight years, where he was cabinet member for children\u2019s services and schools in the Vale of Glamorgan council. He told Sky News that although Ogmore had been considered a safe Labour seat, \u201cwe\u2019ve canvassed non-stop, we\u2019ve taken nothing for granted.\u201d Elmore said he was \u201clooking forward to getting my hands dirty\u201d in Westminster. He insisted that Jeremy Corbyn had not been asked to stay away from Ogmore in the wake of the row over Ken Livingstone\u2019s comments.  He said: \u201cThere was no request from Welsh Labour to ask Jeremy to stay away. He was up here on Wednesday for an excellent visit to some businesses in Maesteg and meeting residents up and down the high street, so absolutely no reason to keep Jeremy away from the Ogmore byelection.\u201d Elmore, who acknowledged policy differences with Corbyn over Trident, said: \u201cJeremy has been elected as leader, we need to make progress now today in these elections and we continue - as he has won that mandate to continue as leader - and we will see how the results go today.\u201d  Huw Irranca-Davies, who had been the MP for the area since 2002 but triggered the byelection by quitting as an MP to contest a seat in the Welsh assembly, told Sky News: \u201cOne thing I won\u2019t miss is the Westminster bubble.\u201d     Huw Irranca-Davies in 2002 following his election as Labour MP for Ogmore. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA    He predicted other Labour MPs may turn their backs on Westminster to pursue their political careers elsewhere.  Following the news that Andy Burnham was considering standing as a candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester, Irranca-Davies said: \u201cWhether the rumours about Andy Burnham are right or not, but certainly with myself, I don\u2019t think this will be the end of it. I think more will look for opportunities of serving their party, their communities, their country in different ways in different places, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",
