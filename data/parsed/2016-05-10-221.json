  "body": "Countryfile would be unrecognisable and unsuccessful if it was made by a commercial broadcaster, according to the show\u2019s executive producer. Bill Lyons said the magazine-style programme\u2019s appeal to audiences was down to its place on the BBC and the resulting public service ethos behind its coverage of the UK\u2019s countryside.  \u201cFor me what underpins its success is the fact that this is a public service programme. Its ethos is public service,\u201d he told the Radio Times. \u201cIf you had to reinvent Countryfile for the commercial market, it would look nothing like what we do now and it wouldn\u2019t be successful. It is the product of its history with the BBC and of its public service values. And the audience loves it for that. That\u2019s important.\u201d   Related: John Craven to host daily Countryfile as record viewers flock to Sunday show    Lyons was talking to the Radio Times as the programme launched a weekday spinoff, Countryfile Diaries. The daily series will feature longstanding presenter, John Craven, as well as new faces including weather presenter Keeley Donovan and radio presenter Margherita Taylor. The main Sunday evening edition has proved a huge and enduring hit with audiences, regularly outperforming big budget Sunday night dramas on both the BBC and its commercial rivals. In March it passed the 8 million viewer mark. Countryfile\u2019s success has been attributed to enthusiasm among city-dwellers for its depiction of a rural idyll. However the show also covers issues such as domestic violence. As well as this, Boris Johnson and David Cameron are set to appear on the programme to lay out their competing arguments on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU ahead of June\u2019s referendum.  It was recently called \u201cthe most political show on TV\u201d by the Guardian\u2019s Simon Jenkins, something Lyons said was down to the inherently political nature of its subject matter. He said: \u201cDo I agree that it\u2019s political? Yes, I do, but it\u2019s not because we set out to be political \u2013 it\u2019s because the territory we occupy, the countryside itself, can\u2019t help but have political heft to it.\u201d",
