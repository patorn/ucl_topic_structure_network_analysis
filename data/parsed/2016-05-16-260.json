And so Lohengrin discovered in the Independent that the title of Wood\u2019s most enduring song ...  9d Band fared badly with randy couple in song (5,3,5)[ synonym for \u2018band\u2019 + anagram (\u2018badly\u2019) of FARED RANDY ]  ... was the same length as that of her most versatile sketch ...  8d Musical article featuring my old pieces (5,8)[ grammatical article around (\u2018featuring\u2019) synonym for expression of surprise (\u2018my\u2019) + synonym for \u2018old pieces\u2019 ][ AN around COR + ANTIQUES ]  ... and made BARRY AND FREDA and ACORN ANTIQUES the framework for a touching tribute puzzle. In the same (digital) paper the next day, Eimi did a similar job for another musician.  I have never seen any firm evidence of his being a devoted solver, but the lyrics on his inner sleeves read like the parsing of cryptic clues and so I shall refuse to believe that he wasn\u2019t. This pair of successive clues should give away the theme ...  13ac Norwegian band covering record by live act finally leading to letters (8)[ AHA (\u2018Norwegian band\u2019) surrounding LP (\u2018record\u2019) + BE (\u2018live\u2019) + T (final letter of ACT ][ A + LP + HA + BE + T ]    15ac Way Oscar-winning actress steered clear of Last Tango (6)[ STREE (STREEP - its last letter) + T (\u2018Tango\u2019 in Nato alphabet) ][ STREE + T ]  ... and whether it does or not, the puzzle contains a poignant hidden valediction (not in the clues, and not in the answers). Latter patter The setter known as Brendan is a former editor of the Times\u2019s puzzles and his occasional visits here with a cryptic challenge are always welcome and welcomed. The only spoiler I\u2019ll give for his most recent puzzle \u2013 which, if you haven\u2019t yet solved, you must do so at once \u2013 is to note that its subject\u2019s use of language threatens to create many new entries in the dictionaries of the century. The neologisms in question include the topic of our next challenge. Reader, how would you clue SYMBLOMATIC? Clueing competition Thanks for your clues for SETTER. What a versatile set of letters. Unexpected surfaces included mojoseeker\u2019s apocalyptic \u201cMy best friend and I left Trieste in chaos\u201d and GeoScanner\u2019s smart \u201cI\u2019m in a jam\u201d. This is not to say that there were not many canine pleasures: Qfwfq73\u2019s malodorous \u201cOdd scent at rear of dog\u201d, say, LeSange\u2019s terse \u201cBasset-terrier crossbreed\u201d and ComedyPseudonym\u2019s plain-sight \u201cIn a Dorset Terrier, we may have found the next winner of Crufts\u201d. And how unexpectedly topical were Peshwari\u2019s \u201cExaminer orders retest\u201d and steveran\u2019s \u201cDoctor time reset \u2013 one points at Hunt\u201d.

Kudos to Kolf; please leave this fortnight\u2019s entries and your pick of the broadsheet cryptics below. Clue of the fortnight A letter-count with two or more digits is usually a great help, but it\u2019s more pleasing when it\u2019s not, as with this Times clue ...  25ac Pour ale all round insect (2,6)[ synonym for \u2018ale\u2019 surrounding an insect ][ BEER around MOTH ]  ... for BE MOTHER.
