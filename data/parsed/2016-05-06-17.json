  "body": "A ribbon was cut and glasses were clinked at last week\u2019s grand opening of a Hilton hotel built alongside the Stadium of Light. As the evening sun dropped lower in the sky and the precincts of Sunderland\u2019s imposing home were cast in giant shadows, suited and booted club officials sporting uniform red-and-white ties headed for the launch party. Dressed down in an open-neck blue shirt, Sam Allardyce cut a relaxed figure, with this laidback demeanour achieved partly thanks to the 61-year-old\u2019s regular practice of transcendental meditation.   Related: Mitrovic rescues point for Newcastle in dramatic derby draw with Sunderland    It is something he regards as a vital weapon in his side\u2019s battle against relegation and a means of coping with the daunting responsibility involved. As hotel staff enthused about welcoming guests from across Europe and the United States, Allardyce was not alone in being acutely conscious of the elephant in the room. Should Sunderland tumble into the Championship, this Hilton will struggle to sell its weekend special football packages and would be far from the only business to suffer in an already economically challenged city. It explains why the sort of function which might normally have been dominated by Brexit-related chatter instead staged even more tortured debates. Might Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s alchemy save Newcastle United after all? Are Norwich City really a spent force? And, whisper it, but where on earth would Sunderland be without Jermain Defoe? Allardyce\u2019s team, like Newcastle and Norwich, are desperate to be the sole survivors of a grim three-way battle to avoid dropping out of the Premier League. With the losers forfeiting next season\u2019s unprecedentedly lavish top-tier television deal, the consequences will not be pretty. As so often happens in these instances, the greatest hurt is likely to involve the collateral damage suffered by those who can least afford it. \u201cMy responsibility is bigger than just keeping the team up,\u201d says Allardyce. \u201cIt\u2019s about saving people\u2019s jobs. There are hundreds of staff working at this club but that workforce would have to be severely cut if we got relegated. It would be devastating. I feel that responsibility. There will be Sunderland fans losing their jobs, many of whom have been here for a long time and love this place.\u201d   Related: Norwich\u2019s Alex Neil aiming to outwit Sam Allardyce and seal survival    The gloom is only intensified by Sunderland\u2019s latest accounts, which show the club lost \u00a325m in the last financial year. Ostensibly Newcastle \u2013 who recorded a \u00a332m profit in the same period and are based in a considerably more affluent regional capital \u2013 seem better placed to cope with Championship life, but Shola Ameobi demurs. The former Newcastle striker is at Fleetwood now but his heart remains on Tyneside. \u201cFootball\u2019s a huge part of life in the city of Newcastle,\u201d says Ameobi, who first played the game on a hillside children\u2019s pitch perched high above St James\u2019 Park. \u201cThe club, the fans and the city as a whole needs Newcastle United to be a Premier League side. It\u2019s essential they stay up.\u201d Having been part of Alan Shearer\u2019s side which suffered relegation in 2009 he knows St James\u2019 does not merely sit in the heart of the city and dominate its skyline but also exerts a heavy influence on its mood, the prosperity of its businesses and its tourism figures. Although Ben\u00edtez\u2019s transformative presence and famously forensic attention to detail have offered a belatedly renascent side a lifeline, the presence of a break clause in his three-year contract, potentially releasing him in the event of relegation, threatens to make any Premier League exit particularly painful. It will be no consolation to Newcastle fans that the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager has sketched out a tentative blueprint which, if survival can be secured, is designed to facilitate a top-four challenge next season. \u201cThis team\u2019s very close to doing well,\u201d the Spaniard says, tantalisingly. Allardyce\u2019s post-survival manifesto will concentrate on trying to secure a comfortable mid-table finish but first he must relegate Ben\u00edtez and Alex Neil. \u201cTranscendental meditation helps me cope with the pressures,\u201d he says. \u201cIt reduces your blood pressure, it keeps you calmer. It refreshes you, makes you feel good to push on. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it for 12 years, since I was first taken through the ritual process. It\u2019s all about focusing the mind and then chilling out. I typically do it three or four times a week but I\u2019m meditating more now because of our league position. I usually do 20 to 25 minutes when the working day\u2019s finished. I\u2019m not a great sleeper but 30\u00a0minutes\u2019 meditation is as good as two or three hours\u2019 sleep, so you feel a bit better.\u201d With Newcastle a point ahead of their neighbours but having played a game more than both relegation rivals, Ben\u00edtez has reason to seek sanctuary in his club\u2019s multi-faith prayer room, yet he seems to be enjoying himself too much to bother. \u201cI like my job and have no problem with pressure,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m quite calm. I enjoy preparing things during the week. Then I go to the game and try to put in some tension.\u201d Norwich\u2019s S\u00e9bastien Bassong, relegated with Newcastle six years ago, would welcome some divine assistance. \u201cMay God help us,\u201d says one of Neil\u2019s centre-halves. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got we\u2019re willing to give and, God willing, it will make the difference.\u201d Unusually the three squads appear tightly bonded. Ben\u00edtez has cleverly repaired locker-room fissures, Sunderland stage weekly squad dinners and Neil\u2019s Norwich retain the camaraderie which helped them achieve promotion last\u00a0May. \u201cAvoiding relegation\u2019s about being together as a team,\u201d says Ameobi. Julio Arca, who went down with Middlesbrough the same year and with Sunderland in 2006 agrees. \u201cWhen you start losing games the atmosphere in the changing room isn\u2019t the best,\u201d says the South Shields midfielder. \u201cAnd once you find yourself in the bottom three, it\u2019s hard to escape.\u201d Allardyce\u2019s instinct is that this fascinating fight will \u201cgo right down to the last day\u201d but he has one prediction. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of anxiety,\u201d says Sunderland\u2019s manager. \u201cThe dressing-room toilets will be busy.\u201d",
