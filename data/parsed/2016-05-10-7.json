  "body": "There has been \u201cno coherent attempt\u201d to assess how many staff will be needed to ensure that a seven-day NHS can function, parliament\u2019s spending watchdog has found.  A report by the public accounts committee says the Department of Health (DH) has not yet worked out if the current supply of staff can adequately meet demand in the health service in England. \u201cNational bodies need to get a better grip on the supply of clinical staff in order to address current and future workforce pressures,\u201d it concludes.   Related: The Guardian view on statistics and NHS reforms: Jeremy Hunt\u2019s number games | Editorial    The report will be seized upon by critics of the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, whose long-running dispute with junior doctors is based on claims that there needs to be more staff working on weekends to ensure patient safety.  MPs add that the DH has failed to assess the staffing implications of the Tories\u2019 pledge for a seven-day NHS.  Hunt wants to change the hours for which junior medics can claim premium rates of pay, turning 7am to 5pm on Saturday into a normal working day, but the report states: \u201cThe department has not adequately assessed the impact on the clinical workforce of implementing seven-day services and so does not know if there will be enough clinical staff with the right skills.\u201d  The group of MPs are calling for an urgent review of NHS clinical staffing in England.  Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said there were serious flaws in the government\u2019s approach to staffing the NHS.  \u201cThis poor workforce planning means patients face the possibility of longer waiting times and a greater cost to the public purse,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, taxpayers are being asked to accept uncosted plans for a seven-day NHS \u2013 plans which therefore present a further serious risk to public money. \u201cIt beggars belief that such a major policy should be advanced with so flimsy a notion of how it will be funded. If the government hopes to reassure the public it has credible plans for staffing and service delivery, we urge it to demonstrate leadership.\u201d MPs point out in the report that there was a shortfall of about 5.9% of clinical staff working in the NHS in 2014, equating to a gap of about 50,000 staff. They warn that this shortfall inhibits the health service in providing an efficient and effective service.  In recent years, NHS trusts have been forced to reduce staff to meet efficiency targets, the report suggests, pointing out that the NHS meets the staffing need by using more costly agency staff, \u201cthereby increasing the financial pressure on the NHS\u201d.  The report criticises the DH for \u201cineffective leadership and support, giving trusts conflicting messages about how to balance safe staffing with the need to make efficiency savings\u201d.    Related: The NHS must not be subjected to a slow and painful demise    Dr Mark Porter, chair of council at the British Medical Association, said: \u201cThis report further underlines the government\u2019s failure to consider how it will staff and fund additional services when the NHS is struggling to provide existing services.  \u201cDespite what ministers claim, NHS funding has not kept up with rising patient demand and the increased cost of delivering care. This situation is only set to get worse, not least because the government\u2019s handling of the junior doctor contract, which has alienated a generation of doctors. This is disastrous for the delivery of patient care in the long term.\u201d  The DH said the report did not take into account an increase in the number of staff or plans to increase capacity to deliver a seven-day NHS.  \u201cBy 2020, we expect to have 11,420 more doctors working in the NHS, coupled with 10,000 nursing, midwife and allied health professional training places through our reforms. By March next year, we will provide a quarter of the population with 7-day care,\u201d it said.",
