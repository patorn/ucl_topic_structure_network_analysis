  "body": "When Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton\u2019s live-action take on Lewis Carroll\u2019s children\u2019s classic, opened in the spring of 2010, cutting-edge 3D was a relatively new phenomenon. Avatar had broken records that winter, setting the bar for the blockbusters that would follow. Audiences craving an experience similar to James Cameron\u2019s space jam flocked to Burton\u2019s film, which also promised viewers an immersive journey to a magical world. The fact that the picture was mauled by critics didn\u2019t seem to deter audiences. After it grossed $1bn worldwide, a sequel was all but inevitable. What\u2019s surprising is how long it\u2019s taken. On the evidence of Alice Through the Looking Glass, Disney didn\u2019t use the time to iron out the kinks that made the first instalment so lacklustre. Instead, the studio has managed to deliver a follow-up that\u2019s even weaker than its predecessor. In crude terms: Alice\u2019s second trip to Underland wasn\u2019t worth the wait.   Related: Alice in Wonderland: Film review    Luckily for Burton, he escapes largely unscathed \u2013 he\u2019s only on as a producer this time around. In the director\u2019s chair is James Bobin, best known for helming the two most recent Muppets films. Narratively, Alice in Wonderland was muddled, incorporating stories from both Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. Given that Burton\u2019s movie cribbed so heavily from the second book, returning scribe Linda Woolverton didn\u2019t have much to work with. Unfortunately, the strain shows.             At first, Alice Through the Looking Glass teases at another pro-feminist paean, with our young spunky heroine Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) following in her father\u2019s footsteps and sailing the ravaging high seas. On her return to London, Alice is dealt a hard blow that threatens to hinder her dreams of doing her father proud. \u201cA sea captain is no job for a lady,\u201d scoffs a stuffy aristocrat.

Once in the gloriously nonsensical world, the story abandons its feminist leanings to focus solely on Alice\u2019s mission to save the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), who has fallen ill (his orange hair morphs to white), haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his family. Together with some help from the White Queen (Anne Hathaway, still affecting the stilted mannerisms that did her no favours in the first film), Alice journeys back in time to solve the riddle of what happened to the Mad Hatter\u2019s clan and, in turn, save her friend.  Woolverton uses this development as an opportunity to offer fans something they probably never desired: an origin story, chronicling what led the Red Queen (returning scene stealer Helena Bonham Carter) to become so wicked (hint: it has to do with the Mad Hatter). Franchise newcomer Sacha Baron Cohen also factors in as a madcap half-clockwork, half-human demigod who protects the device used by Alice to travel in time. Like the film\u2019s oversaturated palette, he throws everything into his performance, but little sticks, including his inscrutable accent.     Time travelling \u2026 Mia Wasikowska goes back to Underland    Similarly, the plot is too busy. The saving grace of Burton\u2019s film was his wise tendency to bask in the wonders of his gothic Underland. Bobin \u2013 not as equipped in the visual department \u2013 merely rushes from one point to the next. The ultimate effect is far from wondrous.",
