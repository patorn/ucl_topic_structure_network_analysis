With summer on the horizon and iced drinks coming back into season, Starbucks is being accused of short-changing its coffee lovers. \u201cA Starbucks customer who orders a Venti cold drink receives only 14 fluid ounces of that drink \u2013 just over half the advertised amount, and just over half the amount for which they are paying,\u201d states the 29-page-long complaint filed by customer Stacey Pincus, the lead plaintiff in the case, filed in northern Illinois federal court on Wednesday, according to Courthouse News Service.  \u201cIn the iced coffee example, a Starbucks customer who orders and pays for a Venti iced coffee, expecting to receive 24 fluid ounces of iced coffee based on Starbucks\u2019 advertisement and marketing, will instead receive only about 14 fluid ounces of iced coffee.\u201d Starbucks\u2019 cold beverages come in four different sizes: tall (12oz), grande (16oz), venti (24oz) and trenta (30oz). Hot beverages are only served in the first three sizes. \u201cIn essence, Starbucks is advertising the size of its cold drink cups on its menu, rather than the amount of fluid a customer will receive when they purchase a cold drink \u2013 and deceiving its customers in the process,\u201d states the lawsuit.   Related: What war on Christmas? Starbucks holiday sales lead to record revenue    Pincus\u2019s complaint also takes issue with the company\u2019s pricing system, which includes higher prices for cold drinks. Since hot drinks do not include ice and cost less, she argues, Starbucks is making more money off of customers buying iced drinks. Starbucks believes that the lawsuit is without merit.  \u201cOur customers understand and expect that ice is an essential component of any \u2018iced\u2019 beverage. If a customer is not satisfied with their beverage preparation, we will gladly remake it,\u201d Jamie Riley, a spokesperson for Starbucks, told CNN. Starbucks customers who desire less ice in their beverages have also been known to ask for \u201clight\u201d ice when placing their orders.  \u201cYou can order light ice or extra ice on any of our iced beverages,\u201d the company tweeted last April.     You can order light ice or extra ice on any of our iced beverages. #ProTip #JustRight\u2014 Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) April 9, 2015    The lawsuit filed by Pincus is to apply to anyone who has purchased an iced beverage in the past 10 years. According to the complaint, the claims could exceed $5m.",
