  "body": "Jermain Defoe remains on a dual mission to not only rescue Sunderland from relegation but also force his way back into the England squad in time for Euro 2016. Sam Allardyce\u2019s key striker is preparing for the vital game at home against Everton on Wednesday knowing victory would relegate both Newcastle United and Norwich City while ensuring the Stadium of Light hosts Premier League football next season.   Related: Arsenal fear Danny Welbeck could miss Euro 2016 with knee injury    Defoe is also well aware that Arsenal\u2019s Danny Welbeck has a knee injury which puts his place in the France-bound squad in jeopardy. Whether this opens a door the 33-year-old had feared was closed for good depends on Roy Hodgson, but Allardyce believes England could benefit from the former Tottenham forward\u2019s goals, experience and big-game nous. Allardyce accepts that without Defoe, who has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season, Sunderland would long since have been relegated. \u201cI just think that if Roy needed any striker to go along, Jermain would be his man,\u201d the manager said. \u201cJermain\u2019s had a big run of games, of the sort he hasn\u2019t had for a few years, and he\u2019s been a consistent performer at the highest level. To score 18 goals for a team that\u2019s been sat in the bottom three or four all season is pretty miraculous.\u201d With Jamie Vardy and Harry Kane at Hodgson\u2019s disposal, Allardyce admits that Defoe might not always start in France but he feels his experience could prove invaluable coming off the bench. \u201cIf you need a goal, Jermain\u2019s the one you want the ball to drop to.\u201d Defoe won the last of his 55 senior caps as a substitute in a 2-0 friendly defeat by Chile at Wembley in November 2013, but he has recently said he would like to resume his international career. So far there has been no contact from Hodgson but Allardyce would not be surprised to receive a phone call. \u201cJermain\u2019s performance this year and his goals particularly may have caused Roy to just take a little look,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows how much experience he\u2019s got, he knows he can do it at that level.\u201d Defoe\u2019s winning goal against Chelsea in the 3-2 victory on Wearside on Saturday has left Sunderland in touching distance of safety \u2013 not bad for a striker often left on the bench by Allardyce\u2019s predecessor, Dick Advocaat. Sunderland\u2019s current manager took over in October and he needed some convincing whether a striker who had arrived from Toronto in January 2015 in exchange for Jozy Altidore made a big enough all-round contribution to meet the requirements of the modern game. Then there was the question of whether Gus Poyet\u2019s principal signing could operate successfully as a lone striker in Sunderland\u2019s 4-1-4-1 formation. \u201cThat was a good swap for Altidore, with all respect to Mr Altidore, one of the best pieces of business this club has ever done,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cAltidore had scored two goals in two years for Sunderland \u2013 but at first I listened to too many people who said Jermain couldn\u2019t play up front on his own. Now Jermain\u2019s proved he can do that job. He\u2019s certainly resurrected himself this season.\u201d Sunderland\u2019s manager is adamant that Hodgson should not be scared off by Defoe\u2019s age. \u201cHe\u2019s a young 33 because he\u2019s not a drinker, he looks after himself properly, he has always been dedicated. He\u2019s into supplementation, diet and nutrition, fluids, recovery. He does it all. He mixes his own [supplement] drinks now, he\u2019s always inquisitive with the backroom staff about \u2018Why do I drink this? Why do I take that? Why do I have this?\u2019 He uses the staff to the maximum. \u201cHe trains every day, rarely seems to get injured, and performs at a very high level. The performances and work-rate are still there. Some of the levels of physical output he puts in have been quite outstanding. His work-rate off the ball is constant and because of that he\u2019s a constant threat for defenders. Even though a lot of the time the ball doesn\u2019t come his way, he\u2019s always worrying the defender and they\u2019re always thinking: \u2018Where is he?\u2019\u201d",
