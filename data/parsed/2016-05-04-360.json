  "body": "Donald Trump could actually be the next president. Just let that sink in. This is a man who actively demeans women, has encouraged violence at his campaign rallies, would ban all Muslims from entering the US and recently seemed undisturbed by an endorsement from a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. And yet Trump, a political outsider, is poised to grasp at the highest office in the land. It was never supposed to happen. But here we are. Tonight in Indiana, in the primary that nobody thought would matter, the thing that nobody thought possible a year ago, is really coming to pass. Donald Trump is going to clinch the Republican nomination. He is really winning, like he always says. Only it\u2019s not a joke or catchy mantra \u2013 it\u2019s reality.   Related: Trump beats Cruz in Indiana primary, clearing path to nomination    And even he seems to understand how absurd that is. \u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable day and evening and year,\u201d Trump said at the beginning of his acceptance speech. Unbelievable is one word for it. After the race was called for Trump on Tuesday night, Ted Cruz, the only thing standing between him and the nomination, suspended his campaign.  This was never supposed to happen. Early polling had showed a tight race between Trump and Cruz. And Cruz had thrown everything he had at the contest, from money, to a newsy presidential pick and a non-aggression pact with John Kasich. Even up until tonight\u2019s election, insiders continued to insist that delegate math would protect the party from Trump\u2019s nomination.  But suddenly with Cruz\u2019s announcement, the specter of a contested convention fell away and the Republican primary was a one-man show. A big, orange, frightening one-man show. Beaming at his audience on stage in the Trump Tower, he heaped lavish praise on people he\u2019s disparaged the most, from women \u2013 he\u2019s called them \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201cfat pigs\u201d \u2013 to Cruz himself, whom he recently declared \u201ceveryone hates.\u201d \u201cHe is a tough smart competitor\u201d, Trump said of Cruz. Never mind what\u2019s honest, Trump has never been concerned with that. The relationship between the two men has always been politically transparent, and tonight was no exception. After all, Trump will need to win over Cruz\u2019s evangelical base if he\u2019s ever going to beat Hillary Clinton in a general election. So with Cruz out of the race, he went from being Trump\u2019s Opponent-in-Chief to being his Ally-in-Chief. And he does have some support in such shenanigans. No sooner had Cruz stepped aside then Republican chairman Reince Priebus tried to get out ahead of the narrative by calling for the party to unite behind Trump. \u201c@realDonaldTrump will be presumptive @GOP nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton\u201d, he tweeted. And some like Alabama\u2019s Jeff Sessions have long said Trump\u2019s just what the party needs. Not everyone\u2019s on-board (Cruz, in one of his last acts as a presidential candidate, nuked the billionaire real estate mogul as a \u201cpathological liar\u201d), but it doesn\u2019t matter any more. With all 57 of Indiana\u2019s delegates under his belt, Trump has a breezy path to the 1,237 count he needs to steer clear of a contested convention in Cleveland this summer. And he doesn\u2019t have an opponent in sight. Indiana was the moment when Cruz said that, if Trump wins again, \u201cAmerica will plunge into the abyss.\u201d Maybe he was right \u2013 November is still a long way off. Meanwhile the new normal in America is a strange reality indeed. Donald Trump is winning and nobody \u2013 not Ted Cruz nor the entire Republican party working in concert (remember the #NeverTrump crusade?), can stop him.",
