  "body": "San Francisco has been forced to walk back a new policy that would allow groups to pay to reserve areas of grass in the popular Dolores Park, in the latest controversy between the city\u2019s wealthy gentrifiers and its poorer residents. The test policy by the parks department, which began at the beginning of May and was supposed to last two months, had caused outrage among local residents. The cost to rent a grass area for \u201cpermitted picnics\u201d would have been between $33 and $260, depending on the size of the group.

But soon after the test run of the policy was first reported, the idea of booking grass areas was halted by Scott Wiener, who serves on the San Francisco board of supervisors, where he chairs the land use committee. Wiener wrote in a statement on Medium: \u201cDespite this program being consistent with long-standing policy in Dolores Park, I do share concerns about reserving lawn areas in the park, given that green space is extremely limited on weekends due to large crowds.\u201d      A reservation sign in Dolores Park.

Thus, Rec & Park will not be allowing additional reservations of the lawn area.\u201d The furor over grass reservations is the latest in a series of increasingly tense standoffs between San Francisco\u2019s older residents, especially in the traditionally Latino area of the Mission, and its newer Google-bus riding, trendy coffee shop-attending arrivals. In one particularly fraught and infamous incident from 2014, a group of tech employees who had rented out a public soccer field through a similar scheme to the Dolores Park project ended up in a tense confrontation with some local youths who were already playing a pickup game on the pitch. Joey Kahn, a spokesman for the San Francisco recreation and park department, said in a statement that \u201cgiven the recent debate\u201d the department wanted \u201cto take a step back to have more open public dialogue\u201d regarding reservation policies at Dolores Park. He added, though, that the permit system was \u201cdesigned to provide accountability for the use of our public parks by larger gatherings\u201d, and also that the permits were necessary for large groups \u201conly to allow us to avoid user conflict and to monitor post event clean-up\u201d. \u2022An earlier version of this story misspelled Jeremiah Boyle\u2019s first name",
