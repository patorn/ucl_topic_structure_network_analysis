  "body": "If it\u2019s a lean week for new DVD releases, that\u2019s just as well: there\u2019s no competing with this week\u2019s classic reissues, beginning with an indispensable new Blu-ray of Ran (Studiocanal, 12). Following a brief but glorious run in cinemas, this 4K restoration of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 31-year-old Sengoku Shakespeare riff transfers every ravishing nuance of its digital makeover to the small screen \u2013 its vast, swarming compositions razor-sharpened, its deep, marbled skies heavy with weather, the regal reds of its military rags glistening as if wet on the canvas. It\u2019s a rare case of restoration as revelation: having first encountered Kurosawa\u2019s poetically brutal redesign of King Lear on comparatively mucky VHS as a teen, I could see what was beautiful about it without fully seeing its beauty. Now, with its visual and sonic textures intensified as intended, the clean, soaring vigour of its storytelling is likewise heightened: the battle scenes in this neatly culture-crossed saga of feudal war and paternal betrayal tremble with personal stakes to match the formal magnitude of their staging. Ran is both great Shakespeare and great Kurosawa; if its relative newness means it\u2019s been a shade less canonised than Seven Samurai, this immaculate polish should change that. Though it\u2019s also been digitally hoovered to pristine effect, a 75th-anniversary reissue of Citizen Kane (Warner, U) isn\u2019t going to have quite the same startling effect, if only because Orson Welles\u2019s thundering 1941 anatomy of a media baron could hardly be more elevated than it is \u2013 that unedifying but imposing \u201cgreatest film of all time\u201d label sticks fast, even if it lost the pole position it held for decades to Vertigo in Sight & Sound\u2019s august critics\u2019 poll. That reputation is a pretty unhelpful prism through which to view the film, attaching expectations of concrete, capital-I Importance even to Welles\u2019s most puckish instincts as a film-maker: once I had watched it as a film rather than a totem, the zest and verve and acrid humour of this precociously nonconformist \u201cbiopic\u201d of a disguised William Randolph Hearst came far more silkily to the fore. The chunkily austere packaging of this special edition \u2014 complete with hardback brochure and commentary-rich extras \u2013 doesn\u2019t exactly play this side up, but it\u2019s a handsome piece.     Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton in Welles\u2019s classic Citizen Kane.    Moving on to newer (if not fresher) fare, Citizen Kane and Daddy\u2019s Home (Universal, 12) may both be deemed films in the sense that dandelions and California redwoods are both plants. Which is not to dismiss Sean Anders\u2019s cheerfully slender family comedy (which quietly racked up \u00a3165m worldwide at Christmas, when no one, save the ticket-buyers themselves, was really looking) out of hand. There\u2019s some jolly comic sparring in this otherwise stencil-cut tale of rival fathers competing for their kids\u2019 affections: Will Ferrell\u2019s prissy, uptight stepdad may lose all the cool points to Mark Wahlberg\u2019s swaggering, ex-military biological one, but Ferrell in harassed mode is still one of the most reliable laugh-getters in mainstream American comedy. If the film lacks a shred of visual ingenuity or even narrative subtext, the stars\u2019 dork-and-cheese chemistry gets it by. It\u2019s certainly more fun than In the Heart of the Sea (Warner, 12), Ron Howard\u2019s suitably shipwrecked, would-be epic account of the maritime disaster that inspired Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick. Wispily embodied by Ben Whishaw, Melville himself steers the film\u2019s stodgy framing device, extracting from grizzled ex-seadog Brendan Gleeson the glum story of how a colossal sperm whale put paid to the Essex whaleship in 1820. The lost-at-sea survival tale that ensues, headed up by strapping first mate Chris Hemsworth, is a smidge more gripping than Melville\u2019s research notes, but Howard injects no propulsive sense of derring-do into proceedings \u2013 even the effects-saturated sequences of catastrophic attack make for some pretty murky spectacle, the camera lens slicked in algae throughout. In terms of internal logic, the murk is similarly thick in Takashi Miike\u2019s demented genre-mash extravaganza Yakuza Apocalypse (Manga, 18), which plays as if scripted during one of those group-writing games where everyone blindly adds a sentence to an ongoing story. Miike, however, makes a virtue of senselessness: there\u2019s barrelling, bananas momentum to this nuclear meltdown of a martial arts B-movie, in which monsters, vampires and a mute marauder in a moth-eaten felt frog costume tear up the expected genre terrain. Miike, already a prolific director by reputation, appears to have made about a dozen films at once here: arduous nightmare fuel for many, but for those on the director\u2019s barely decipherable wavelength, it\u2019s an almighty party.     In The Heart Of The Sea: a \u2018pretty murky spectacle\u2019.    Intrepid cinemagoers are currently bathing in the heady delights of Portuguese auteur Miguel Gomes\u2019s astonishing Arabian Nights trilogy, but those waiting for the film to hit Mubi.com\u2019s streaming menu in the next month can do some prep work. Never previously released in the UK, Gomes\u2019s 2004 debut The Face You Deserve is also getting a Mubi airing, and it\u2019s well worth a dive. Labelling it more conventional than Gomes\u2019s subsequent output is strictly a relative call: there\u2019s enough wistful whimsy to this musical comedy of a 30-year-old manchild surrendering to his alter egos to drive some around the bend. Just as many, however, will be enchanted by Gomes\u2019s fey muddling of fairy-tale convention with postmodern romanticism. Consider it a sweetly inessential introduction to an essential voice.",
