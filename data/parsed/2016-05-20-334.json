  "body": "It was a surprisingly meteoric rise for James McAvoy, who seemed to go from foppish love interest to action hero to superhero in what felt like weeks.    Related: X-Men: Apocalypse review \u2013 lots of bangs for your bucks but loopiness is lost    McAvoy has been quiet of late (if you forget last year\u2019s execrable franchise non-starter Victor Frankenstein), but he\u2019s got a busy year or so ahead. He\u2019ll star alongside Charlize Theron in the spy thriller The Coldest City, lead M Night Shyamalan\u2019s mystery Split and romance Alicia Vikander in Wim Wenders\u2019 ambitious Submergence.  First up, however, McAvoy is returning this week as Professor X in the X-Men: Apocalypse. It\u2019s the third time he\u2019s taken on the role, and because reviews suggest this is the weakest of the franchise, we\u2019re here to remind you of happier times \u2026 The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe            After roles on the small screen (from Shameless to State of Play) and a failed Brit-com vehicle (Inside I\u2019m Dancing), McAvoy secured a role in his first blockbuster. It was a small part, but he displayed the requisite charm, and didn\u2019t need to return for any of the lesser sequels. Job well done. The Last King of Scotland            Acting opposite an Oscar-winning Forest Whitaker, McAvoy more than held his own in Kevin Macdonald\u2019s true-ish thriller about Idi Amin, adapted from the novel by Giles Foden. His character \u2013 an amalgamation of sorts \u2013 is arguably the more interesting of the two, as he becomes aware of just what his new friend is capable of. Starter for 10            It\u2019s far from a perfect film, but there is a pleasant ease to this adaptation of David Nicholls\u2019 comedy novel. Here McAvoy is the lead, giving him an opportunity to showcase his comic credentials. Starter for 10 was also a strange hotbed for talent: Rebecca Hall, Alice Eve and Benedict Cumberbatch co-starred. Atonement            Despite the period trappings, Joe Wright\u2019s adaptation of the wartime book by Ian McEwan was a welcome antidote to its more conventional peers when it came out in 2007. McAvoy skilfully handled both the harrowing war scenes and his flirtation with Keira Knightley. Filth            After some less convincing roles in action films, McAvoy proudly took a piss all over his heartthrob image with his role in this foul-mouthed Irvine Welsh adaptation. He\u2019s surprisingly convincing as a hard-drinking, drug-taking, morally vacuous cop, and he also helps to deliver a sucker punch of an ending that brings real poignancy.",
