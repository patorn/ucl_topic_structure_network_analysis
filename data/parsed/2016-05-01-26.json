  "body": "Oh dear me, I think I am having a cardiac arrest. Weeks and weeks of complaints about nothing much happening and then this. I\u2019m not sure my nerves are up to seeing this through. \u201cAlright, Percy, time\u2019s up.\u201d Oh, this was unbearable. Was she ever going to get away? Would Percy go with her? I almost died thinking about what Charlie would do if he caught her. \u201cWhere is my wife? Where is my son?\u201d And then the finger-breaking ... Oh heavens.  Then they had to hang about waiting for the bloody pre-paid rickshaw because it\u2019s a really good idea to waste precious time when you are married to someone with murderous impulses who will be very angry to learn you have gone. Don\u2019t wait, Alice! Have a row about rickshaws and get out of there! And of course the inevitable happens and Evil Charlie wins again. My heart was in my mouth. And who was looking after Percy? Did he run into the street? I don\u2019t know if I can wait a whole week to find out what happens next \u2013 and I do not usually feel this way. Damn you, Channel 4, for pulling it out of the bag for Indian Summers so late!      Alice plans her escape. Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4    As Alice put it in the opening scenes: \u201cThis whole adventure will come crashing down before long ...\u201d we\u2019re on a countdown now. Two more episodes to go and then we\u2019re done. And not just done, but properly done: Channel 4 has not renewed the contract, despite the fact that this was due to go to five series. It\u2019s probably the right decision because, despite all indications to the contrary in tonight\u2019s heart-stopper, this series has lost momentum. But it is a shame, especially when the high points of Indian Summers really are sublime.  Before all the health-threatening action, though, a veritable festival of suspense was unleashed here, all trembling clutch bags, secret notes and meaningful glances ahead of Aafrin and Alice\u2019s elopement. We moved swiftly away from the slapstick feel of last week\u2019s multi-Sooni-proposal and into far more dangerous territory. Even Mr Ian was morphing into a bit of an Evil Charlie by the end.     Mr Ian\u2019s spread fails to woo Sooni. Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4    There was a more laidback feel early on as Mr Ian laid on a feast for Sooni and did his hair and everything. But it soon soured and all went black. Can Mr Ian pull in front of Mr Khan? Of course he can\u2019t. How fond I have grown of Sooni, though, and her beautifully kohl\u2019d eyes. \u201cYe cannae wish it into life if it\u2019s no there.\u201d The best was yet to come. Mr Khan: \u201cDon\u2019t despair, Mr Ian. You will love again.\u201d This was my favourite scene ever. \u201cPlease. God ... No ... With him? You? Right from under my nose. You sneaky, ink-stained lothario.\u201d Poor Mr Ian. And, of course, now Sooni says yes to Mr Khan! Hurrah! But will he survive her pebble-encrusted cooking?  Unsurprisingly, however, her parents are set on Eyebrow Man (because they don\u2019t know that their problems are about to get a million times worse as Evil Charlie locks Aafrin in the Secret Love Room of Doom). \u201cMr Khan? From The Simla Times?\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s a Muslim!\u201d I loved that Sooni\u2019s mother was most concerned about the fasting and the stupid food. And they don\u2019t even know what Aafrin is planning ... \u201cYou would kill your poor mother for sure.\u201d Well, don\u2019t worry about that because Evil Charlie will kill everyone in the whole of India first. Political shenanigans     Ralphie and Madeleine put a brave face about the maharajah buggering off to Baden Baden. Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4    Ralphie\u2019s plan to take his place in history as the man who made progress in India lies in tatters. \u201cWe had a deal. We made an agreement.\u201d The pet maharajah has buggered off to Baden-Baden and now there is no one left to vote for the bill. And now Ralphie blames Madeleine for the maharajah sex not being good enough. Madeleine, however, has turned out to be a lot cooler than I thought, supporting Alice and shrugging off the theft of the maharajah\u2019s mother\u2019s statement necklace. Madeleine is unflappable, unreadable and a born diplomat. She was the one who was prepared to put out for a man in a dodgy earring to save the Empire. That is true sacrifice. It would be better if Madeleine were the Viceroy. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything but maybe that will be the final twist at the end of this series? There were various pointless bits of exposition justifying Sarah still being in the country. (Not that I mind. I like Sarah \u2013 more than she likes herself.) \u201cNobody knows who put that thing there. But we\u2019re going to find them. And when we do, we\u2019ll show them we\u2019re not afraid.\u201d Well, it\u2019s all too late for that because the bomb was laid by Bonkers Naresh and he has gone to meet The Adulterous Schoolteacher in the sky. No one misses them. Evil Britisher of the week     Evil Charlie is back on form. Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4    It\u2019s hard to find words for Charlie\u2019s evilness this week, but let\u2019s just say that he\u2019s back on form. And his fingers are capable of destroying more than a tune on a banjo. First, though, he was at pains to humiliate Ralphie with a reminder of who works at the bank. \u201cWilson Hutchinson has asked that you settle your account ... It\u2019s four hundred thousand.\u201d Woah! \u201cWhat a pickle.\u201d And the face before the handshake! Blake Ritson, you are the best. I became very concerned that he would murder Alice before she had a chance to run away. And then he would murder Cynthia too for helping. But he has another two episodes in which to effect all that. I think he will do it slowly and with a twirl of his moustache. The Julie Walters Fan Club     Cynthia shows Sarah who\u2019s boss. Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4    \u201cSome local hero has hoisted the Indian flag in the middle of Cynthia\u2019s lawn.\u201d Soon replaced with the Union Jack and a rousing rendition of Jerusalem. Bravo, Cynthia! And here she was back on top. \u201cEverybody knows me and I know everybody.\u201d How on earth did Cynthia find out about Alice\u2019s tickets? She really is the Derren Brown of Simla. I am hoping Cynthia will be the secret weapon in the fight against Evil Charlie which is surely going to be the set piece for the end of this series. Who cares about the fate of India now that Evil Charlie will have everyone in his sights? He\u2019s a psychopath when he\u2019s in a good mood. I dread to think what he\u2019ll do now that he\u2019s got good reason. If I were Cynthia, I\u2019d burn down the club before Charlie gets there ...",
