  "body": "Northern Ballet: Jane Eyre  Cathy Marston\u2019s new ballet promises to extract the radical and romantic heart from the Charlotte Bront\u00eb classic. With a nicely feminist twist, Philip Feeney has also incorporated music by the 19th-century composer Fanny Mendelssohn into his own newly commissioned score.\u202219 to 21 May, Cast, Doncaster. Then touring.   Related: Curtain-raisers: the best theatre of summer 2016    Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young: Betroffenheit  The wonderful Crystal Pite collaborates with the theatre director and performer Jonathon Young on this coruscating exploration of grief. Betroffenheit is a term used to describe the verbal and physical disorientation produced by an extreme traumatic state, and Pite takes the starting point of a situation of bereavement and loss, to push the boundaries of her dancers\u2019 physical powers of expression.\u202231 May to 1 June, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London. Royal Ballet mixed bill  The last programme in the Royal Ballet\u2019s current season features a new work by Wayne McGregor, a setting of music by the Finnish conductor and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen, renowned for his eclectic contemporary idiom and rhythmic wit. Sharing the bill is a revival of The Invitation, Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s pioneeringly brutal exploration of the sexual dynamics between a young man and woman and an older married couple; also a second outing for Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s lush and finely crafted Within the Golden Hour.\u2022In rep from 28 May to 11 June, Royal Opera House, London.  Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s Shakespeare triple bill  BRB join the Shakespeare 400 celebrations with this mixed programme. Jessica Lang\u2019s new work, Wink, is inspired by the sexual and emotional ambivalence of the sonnets; Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n\u2019s modern dance classic, The Moor\u2019s Pavane, is a distillation of the themes and characters from Othello; and in Shakespeare Suite, director David Bintley uses Duke Ellington\u2019s titular score to choreograph a surreal jazz dance through the Shakespeare oeuvre.\u202222 to 25 June, Birmingham Hippodrome.

Photograph: Bill Cooper    LA Dance Project  This Los Angeles-based dance group was founded in 2012 by the choreographer, dancer and soon-to-be ex-director of Paris Opera Ballet, Benjamin Millepied. Since then, the company has developed an impressive repertory, combining classics from the modern dance repertory with new commissions. This brief UK season features two works by Millepied: Gems 3, created in collaboration with the composer Andy Akiho; and Hearts & Arrows, set to the music of Philip Glass. There\u2019s also a new work Harbour by the always excellent Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui.\u202224 to 25 June, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London.     LA Dance Project are coming to Sadler\u2019s Wells, London.    Natalia Osipova and guests  The outstanding and unpredictable Russian ballerina has commissioned a programme of new contemporary dance from three, very different choreographers: Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Arthur Pita (with whom she collaborated on her previous programme, Solo for Two), and Russell Maliphant, who creates a duet for Osipova and her new on- and off-stage partner, Sergei Polunin.\u202229 June to 3 July, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London; 12 to 14 August, Festival theatre, Edinburgh. Australian Ballet season  The Australian Ballet, a classical company with a 54-year history, have developed a distinctive relationship with tradition, exemplified by the two works in this short London season. Graeme Murphy rewrites Swan Lake as the story of a dysfunctional royal marriage, with parallels to Charles, Diana and Camilla. In Alexei Ratmansky\u2019s Cinderella, the fairytale is a given a witty update to 20th-century Russia.\u202213 to 23 July, Coliseum, London.         Watch a clip of a 2015 performance of Graeme Murphy\u2019s Swan Lake    The Bolshoi Ballet  The great Moscow company return for their regular London season with a mix of familiar classics and some more contemporary repertory. Don Quixote and Swan Lake are inevitably in there, but so is Jean Christophe Maillot\u2019s vivid, playful adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew, and Alexei Ratmanksy\u2019s reimagining of the old Soviet classic Flames of Paris. Olga Smirnova, Denis Rodkin and Artem Ovcharenko are among the season\u2019s principals.\u202225 July to 13 August, Royal Opera House, London.   Related: Scorchers: the hottest films of summer 2016    Scottish Ballet: Edinburgh international festival  The Glasgow-based company have carved out a niche for themselves in Scotland\u2019s premiere festival, and this year present what promises to be a superb double bill of 21st-century works. Crystal Pite\u2019s Emergence is a piece of swarming monumental power set to music by Owen Belton; Angelin Preljocaj describes his work MC 14/22 (Ceci Est Mon Corps) as a hymn to the male body \u2013 its capacity for beauty and tenderness, rather than its aggressive force.\u2022 18 to 20 August, Festival theatre, Edinburgh.     A hymn to the male body \u2026 Scottish Ballet.    Jasmin Vardimon Company: Pinocchio  Jasmin Vardimon\u2019s talent for vivid dance theatre turns towards a family audience in her new adaptation of the classic tale by Carlo Collodi. Text, dance and an inventive set promise to dramatise the comedy and strangeness of the story, and explore what it means to be human.\u2022 27 to 28 August, Gulbenkian theatre, Kent. Then touring.",
