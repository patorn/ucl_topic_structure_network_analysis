  "body": "Where would we be without New Kids on the Block? Clean-cut and always ready to burst into harmonies or a complicated piece of choreography at a moment\u2019s notice, they set the template for subsequent boy bands, first the Backstreet Boys and *N Sync, then One Direction. In America at least, New Kids breathed new life into teen pop music and stoked a newly rabid kind of pop fandom. Plus, they laid the blueprint for Lou Pearlman\u2019s business model, which may have landed him in prison but also transformed the charts of the late 90s and early 00s. The New Kids were influential. They mattered. Which is exactly what journalist Rebecca Wallwork set out to prove in her book, Hangin\u2019 Tough. It\u2019s part of the 33 \u2153 series that has seen different writers tackle a famous album. The books have ranged from Michaelangelo Matos on Prince\u2019s Sign O\u2019 the Times to Alex Niven on Oasis\u2019s Definitely Maybe. There\u2019s nothing ironic about her admiration of the album \u2013 she was a fan. \u201c[I was] a Blockhead,\u201d Wallwork explains over the phone. \u201cI was a little late to the game with New Kids because I was in Australia. The Right Stuff is where I began, probably a few months later than the American Blockheads, but I\u2019m still a fan to this day.\u201d To give it its full title, You Got It (The Right Stuff) was NKOTB\u2019s breakthrough hit. Released in 1988, it got to No 3 in the States and No 1 in the UK.             And Wallwork doesn\u2019t use the term \u201cfan\u201d lightly: she\u2019s met the band upward of 20 times (not including when she\u2019s met members individually or as a music writer), and her Tumblr boasts photos of herself as a teen proudly posing by her NKOTB merch, proving the seriousness of her dedication and how long it\u2019s lasted. \u201cI was 13 when I first saw [The Right Stuff] video, and it just seemed so cool and funky,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard music like that before. And if you listen to it now, it still sounds kind of different. It doesn\u2019t sound to me like Backstreet Boys or *N Sync or One Direction \u2013 it was dancey, they were driving around in a convertible picking up chicks, and I was like, \u2018You look cool, I like this.\u2019 They grabbed my eye, I\u2019ll admit it. And then I really did love the music. \u201cAnd in a way, they were safe,\u201d she adds. \u201cParents allowed their kids to become quite obsessed with them because it wasn\u2019t a bad obsession.\u201d A sentiment anyone who\u2019s dabbled in boy band culture (hi!) will understand. There\u2019s safety in basking in a relationship you can dictate exclusively through your own frame of mind. There\u2019s comfort in deciphering the meaning of lyrics, or poring over interviews and hoping the member you like implies he\u2019s single. (Wallwork\u2019s favourite member is Joe, by the way: \u201cHe was closest to my age - he seemed sweet.\u201d)            \u201cMusic cognition specialists said that what you listen to at 13 and 14 is what sticks with you and what you come back to,\u201d Wallwork tells me. \u201cBecause that\u2019s a time when we\u2019re establishing our identity, and it\u2019s a time [when] your hormones are going crazy, so music has that same effect. And it\u2019s so powerful at that age that it imprints in such an impactful way.\u201d But are people just fondly remembering their youth when they listen to New Kids? \u201cI asked music cognition specialists and fans if it was just nostalgia because people don\u2019t ever talk about the New Kids\u2019 music, but I love the music,\u201d Wallwork continues. \u201cAnd when I hear it, I really like their songs. And some of them get me in such an amazing mood. So I can\u2019t really say it\u2019s just the music because they are cute and they dance and the videos are fun and seeing them live is incredible, and that\u2019s where I think they earn their stripes and the devotion of their fans, because they give it their all onstage.\u201d So why choose Hangin\u2019 Tough as the album to write about? \u201cIt\u2019s the one that made them,\u201d she explains. \u201cWithout Hangin\u2019 Tough I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d have become as big as they did. Hangin\u2019 Tough was such a hit \u2013 it sold 17m copies. That\u2019s a lot. And I know the whole music industry has changed, but at the time it was a big deal. So it\u2019s not just fans liking boy bands, there\u2019s something going on there. So I wanted to dig in a little bit more and ask why it was such a hit and also is it any good, because I don\u2019t really know. I interviewed people and asked if they were good songs, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Yes, these are classic, catchy pop songs.\u2019 So that was a really interesting process.\u201d            Though teen pop is still not exactly the first thing music critics rush to write about, it\u2019s treated more seriously than it was in the New Kids\u2019 heyday \u2013 Wallwork points out that the Backstret Boys, *N Sync and One Direction have all made the cover of Rolling Stone and been have covered extensively \u2013 and sometimes even seriously \u2013 in the mainstream press. NKOTB, on the other hand, were voted 1989\u2019s worst band by Rolling Stone\u2019s readers. \u201cThey never got the courtesy of their music being looked at,\u201d Wallwork says. \u201cAnd I wanted to do that.\u201d Which is thankfully what 33 \u2153\u2019s publishers Bloomsbury wanted her to do too. Largely producing books devoted to the cult or canonical, it\u2019s a departure for the series to publish a tome defending heavily produced 80s pop sung by a Wahlberg. \u201cI was really surprised that they chose to do this book,\u201d Wallwork admits. \u201cI think my proposal is what became the book: Like, \u2018Why don\u2019t people talk about New Kids?\u2019 Things have changed. This is the chance to do it now. It would never have happened 20 or 10 years ago, but with some distance, that helps. \u201cMy feeling is that [33 \u2153] is not necessarily the best albums \u2013 it\u2019s key albums or influential albums. So I think there was this recognition that this album changed things. I expect that there\u2019ll be some backlash, but I think it\u2019s earned its place.\u201d And considering we still cite New Kids when discussing the intricacies of One Direction or Zayn Malik\u2019s solo career (he is such a Jordan Knight) or Backstreet Boys\u2019 residency in Las Vegas, it\u2019s safe to say it has. Plus, NKTOB continue to tour, to perform, and to record \u2013 their reality show about their annual cruise, Rock This Boat, starts its second season on Pop TV on 1 June \u2013 meaning there\u2019s audience still ready for their music.  But aside from our acknowledgement that New Kids paved the way for the most talked-about bands of this era (and our acknowledgement that boy bands are everything and we all know it), what\u2019s a book on Hangin\u2019 Tough supposed to do? \u201cI hope the takeaway is a second thought,\u201d she says. \u201cThat pause when you step back. Because I think people used to have a kneejerk reaction with them. And now that we have time, I would like them to listen to it. Or think about them a second time. [Ask] why did I hate on them? Why did I have that immediate reaction? Was it because everyone else was saying they were uncool? So I want people to look past that and see that there was something to the music. There\u2019s a reason people love this music.\u201d Which is exactly how I\u2019ll justify blaring this record all summer, friends\u2019 taste in pop music be damned.",
