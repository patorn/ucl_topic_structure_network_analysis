  "body": "A man accused of murdering his six-year-old daughter has attacked the Crown Prosecution Service for putting him on an \u201cunfair trial\u201d as he gave evidence for the first time in the case. Speaking at the Old Bailey on Friday, Ben Butler launched a vigorous defence when questioned over the death of his daughter Ellie in October 2013, when she was found with \u201ccatastrophic\u201d head injuries akin to those found in high-speed car crashes. He said he would not be \u201cmuzzled\u201d and claimed that he had been a victim of a miscarriage of justice when he was convicted in 2009 of assaulting his daughter after she was hospitalised with injuries similar to shaken baby syndrome at seven weeks old. He described the system as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and accused the crown of omitting critical evidence that he claimed would prove his innocence. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve lost evidence in this trial that we would be able to prove there was more wrong with my daughter,\u201d he said. On his first day in the witness stand, Butler, 36, described St Helier hospital in south London, where Ellie was examined after he rushed her to A&E when she was aged seven weeks, as the \u201cworst hospital in the world\u201d.  He told jurors he was \u201cdevastated\u201d and \u201cbamboozled\u201d when Ellie was subsequently taken into foster care after \u201cthe wonderful Sutton social services\u201d stepped in before they knew what had happened to his daughter. The jury had previously been told that Butler was found guilty of assaulting her and the conviction was quashed. Butler launched his outburst about the legal system after being asked by his counsel, Icah Peart QC, about the expert evidence used in the family court\u2019s decision to return Ellie to her family from foster care. He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking disgrace and I\u2019ve no problem saying that. It\u2019s been slammed by the high court judges, the expert witness on shaken baby syndrome, and all that the way the trial was conducted.\u201d Referring to the original criminal trial in 2009, he said: \u201cThere were 10 experts that the crown produced every time \u2026 Mr and Mrs Guilty \u2026 I was allowed three experts.\u201d  Peart said: \u201cWe all know you were convicted and sent to prison.\u201d to which Butler replied: \u201cI was unfairly convicted and I had an unfair trial and I\u2019m having an unfair trial now.\u201d \u201cFirstly, I\u2019ve been charged with murdering my daughter but you\u2019re actually charging me with arguing with my wife,\u201d he said, in reference to a barrage of abusive text exchanges between him and Ellie\u2019s mother, Jennie Gray, who is on trial over a separate charge relating to child cruelty. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be muzzled here. I\u2019m not going to stop saying what I\u2019m saying. Secondly, you\u2019ve got experts here. They\u2019ve already been used against us in every trial. Thirdly, we\u2019ve lost evidence in this trial that we would be able to prove there was more wrong with my daughter,\u201d he said. The judge then intervened, saying: \u201cWe are getting into difficult territory,\u201d to which Butler replied: \u201cI\u2019m not being muzzled.\u201d Mr Justice Wilkie said: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to muzzle this witness\u201d Butler replied: \u201cSounds like you are.\u201d  Wearing a light grey suit and a paisley tie, he described how excited he was when Ellie was born on 30 December 2006. He laughed when he told jurors how he and Gray met in a pub after her brother fell off a bar stool in Sutton, south London, where they both lived. They saw each other casually but within weeks Gray had fallen pregnant. He told the jury he thought the pregnancy was the \u201ckiss of death\u201d but became supportive. He said that although he thought friends with babies were \u201cfucking boring\u201d, when his own daughter was born he was proud and excited. Butler and Gray were not living together at the time of the birth and they were not in a relationship, the court heard, but Butler said he would see the baby every day because he missed her so much. There were occasions, he recalled, when Gray told him that the baby had gone pale and seemed to have trouble breathing, but he said the couple were reassured by the district nurse. \u201cI noticed it myself \u2013 she makes a noise like a snorting noise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe talked about it. The nurse said sometimes babies do that. Me, and Jennie was a first-time mum, so we just listened to what they said.\u201d He recalled a day, 15 February 2007, when Gray took Ellie to the house he shared with others. \u201cNormally she\u2019d come round with 50 bags like J-Lo \u2026 Ellie was in the car seat. I said: \u2018Fucking hell, why did she look like that, I\u2019d never seen her like that,\u2019\u201d he told jurors. She was \u201csheet white\u201d, Butler said, but Gray had told him: \u201cI know, but she does that sometimes.\u201d He took the baby upstairs and tried to feed her but she did not seem to be hungry, so he put her in a car seat beside the chair he was sitting on, he told the court. After a while he noticed that she looked different, with her arms by her sides when normally her hands would be up by her face. \u201cI picked her up, her arms were like chicken, how can I describe, that soft feeling, no resistance. I started panicking,\u201d he said. He called the ambulance but while waiting cleared Ellie\u2019s airways with his fingers and \u201cshe went, \u2018ha, ha,\u2019 like that,\u201d he said, drawing breath twice. \u201cShe seemed she was all right. I\u2019d overpanicked. I said don\u2019t worry about the ambulance, she\u2019s fine, but it seemed she wasn\u2019t all right, her arms were still, there was no resistance,\u201d Butler said. He called the ambulance again but when it did not arrive, he called a friend to take her to A&E at St Helier hospital. After initial treatment the doctors told him that Ellie was unlikely to survive. \u201cShe probably won\u2019t make it through the night. If she does she\u2019ll be probably blind, deaf and in a vegetative state,\u201d Butler said, shaking his head in the direction of Gray, who was in the dock. \u201cWe were all shocked, in disbelief. \u2018Why, why what\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019 She [the doctor] said the only way that she could be like this was to be violently shaken,\u201d he said, shaking his head to jurors. He described how the decision was then taken to transfer Ellie to \u201ca proper hospital\u201d, Evelina London children\u2019s hospital. Immediately there was \u201ca different vibe\u201d, he said. While St Helier had jumped to the conclusion that the baby had been shaken violently, the doctors at Evelina were not accusing and told them that they believed the injury was caused at birth, he said. \u201cIt was like a fucking angel just appeared. This guy came out, a proper doctor, he said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s going to be fine,\u2019\u201d Butler said. In what he said was the \u201cbiggest fuck-up in my life\u201d he suggested that the baby should be taken back to St Helier so visiting would be easier. When they returned to St Helier \u201cthey were already bang bang bang, they wouldn\u2019t accept that Ellie was damaged at birth\u201d. Sutton social services got an interim care order and Ellie was placed in foster care. \u201cBearing in mind they said she was a shaken baby and that was not going to live the night, she was well enough to be released after five or seven days,\u201d Butler told the jury. Butler told jurors how his two-year battle to get Ellie back had taken its toll and the couple would turn to drink \u201cjust to pass time\u201d. Travelling up and down to the high court for a seven-week hearing in the family divivision over seven and a half weeks in the summer of 2012 also left them short of money, he said. \u201cWe were both obviously fucked, we were on benefits. We were visiting solicitors. We can laugh about it now, but we had to go bin raiding one night, bin raiding in Iceland,\u201d he told jurors. Fighting in the family courts turned into a near full-time job, he said, and alleged that one day he came home and found Jennie on the floor drunk and shouting. Shortly afterwards she found she was pregnant again and decided to have an abortion, but that went wrong, he said. \u201cShe was fucking crazy, she was fucking crazy, she was going mad,\u201d Butler said. \u201cShe went back to the hospital and that\u2019s when they left the remains inside her and they hadn\u2019t done this properly,\u201d said Butler. She feared the operation would have left her infertile, he said. Ellie, who was being fostered by her grandparents, was eventually returned into her parents\u2019 care in November 2012. Butler said that \u201cindependent social workers\u201d appointed by the high court judge were good because \u201cSutton social services couldn\u2019t be trusted to do anything\u201d. The independent social workers said \u201cmy and Jennie\u2019s interaction was the best they had ever seen\u201d, he claimed. Butler told jurors that Gray\u2019s relationship with her father was poor and they were \u201cat each other all the time\u201d. Later Butler told the jury he was a good dad and \u201chorrible\u201d texts he sent Gray months after they had won a legal battle for the return of Ellie did not affect his attitude to his daughter. He told jurors Gray was mentally affected by frequent bouts of heavy bleeding and she would lose interest in Ellie. He was so scared that social workers would come and take Ellie away again that he contemplated suicide, he claimed. He said that Christmas with Ellie in 2012, 10 months before she died, went well but that his relationship with Gray was very fraught in the three months after. \u201cIf this was a likeability contest I will not be getting a Blue Peter badge any time soon,\u201d he told the court. Gray\u2019s bleeding would leave her hospitalised for up to 10 days at a time, he said. He told jurors he needed her to be around to help Ellie settle in after five years in foster care. He would sometimes threaten Gray that he would call social services but it was all a bluff to get her out of hospital, he claimed. He also claimed they argued by text, not in front of Ellie. Butler frequently swore during his testimony and explained to the court that it was how he normally communicated.  He is accused of murdering Ellie when he was alone at home with her and another child on 28 October 2013. Butler and Gray, 36, are jointly charged with child cruelty over an untreated broken shoulder the girl sustained weeks before her death. They both deny the charges. The trial resumes on Tuesday.",
