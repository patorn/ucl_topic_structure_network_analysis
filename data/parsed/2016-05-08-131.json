After a conversation on the phone where he pressed me on my academic credentials \u2013 a recent PhD from LSE \u2013 we arranged to meet outside his favourite lunch haunt in Kensington. When he arrived I said simply: \u201cNice to meet you Mr Powell, I\u2019m from the BBC.\u201d \u201cWhere is Dr Barling?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat would be me!\u201d I replied. He was startled, but I was used to fluster \u2013 I was often mistaken for a cab driver at the BBC. The noisy banter stopped as we went in. Some people were choking on their soup.    He was startled \u2013 I was often mistaken for a cab driver at the BBC. People were choking on their soup    We were there to work, but for me there was also unfinished business. After Powell\u2019s 1968 \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, I\u2019d been spat at in the playground at school. I remember wiping phlegm off my face. But I bided my time. Powell bemoaned the European desire to resurrect the \u201cImperium of the Holy Roman Empire\u201d; it would unleash the pent-up antipathies of European history, he said. Eventually, during dessert, I asked if he felt Britain had turned out the way he expected. I put it to him that people like me were proof his prediction was way off the mark. \u201cAh yes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I was not thinking about people like you. I was more concerned about those people with whom our culture and values would continue to clash.\u201d I countered that he couldn\u2019t really know who people like me were just because of my position and education. He looked at me wearily and said: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced there isn\u2019t still time for trouble if we do not find a common path forward.\u201d My activist grandfather would have been proud of my next question. I asked Powell if he was a racist. His reply: \u201cIt depends what you mean by that. I don\u2019t believe a man is a lesser man because he is coloured, but it doesn\u2019t mean I might choose to live with him if he is different from me.\u201d I still firmly believe Powell was wrong. Back then as a politician he saw his main chance and tried to seize it. Powell died in 1998. Since then the question of how we live with our differences in the face of political extremism has clearly not gone away.
