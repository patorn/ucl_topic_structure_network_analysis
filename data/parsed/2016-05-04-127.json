  "body": "A TALE OF TWO CITIES (THREE IF YOU COUNT THE REFERENCE TO COV)  Don\u2019t get us wrong. The Fiver is as happy as the next person that Leicester City have won the league. Providing that next person isn\u2019t a supporter of Derby County. Or Coventry City. Or Nottingham Forest, who can\u2019t bang on about 1977-78 being the greatest underdog story of all time any more \u2026 for goodness sake do you need everything, aren\u2019t the two subsequent Big Cups enough? Or they\u2019re getting fed up reading articles about betting odds. Or had assumed they\u2019d seen the back of Kasabian in 2007. Or has been exposed to so many clips of Claudio Ranieri being sweet that they\u2019re risking the onset of type-two diabetes. Or are employed by either Tottenham Hotspur or Chelsea and had gone to the trouble of staging a couple of marvellous 1970s-style bench-emptying brawls only for everyone to forget about them almost immediately. None of those folk are very happy about it at all. Oh the humanity!   Related: Manchester City equipped for Real Madrid after learning from past faults | Daniel Taylor    These poor people can at least take succour from the fact that, in this country, success stories only have so much currency, and at some point everyone will begin to show signs of severe Foxes Fatigue now that the underdogs have entered the mainstream. A feelgood fairytale? No thanks! No thanks! This is Britain! Take Manchester City as an example, for so long everyone\u2019s beloved second team as they bobbed up and down the divisions, flailing around in a hapless but endearing fashion. But these days they\u2019re a source of supreme irritation, winning more than their fair share of trophies, signing all the hottest talent, and giving the editors of Football Focus excuses to run interminable quip-heavy interviews with Noel Gallagher, who we\u2019d otherwise have seen the back of in 2007. However in Europe, City are still considered something of a novelty and, as such, retain a little of their old-school charm. On Wednesday evening they reprise their former role as popular underdogs when they visit Real Madrid for the second leg of their Big Cup semi. Real welcome back Him, who during the first leg in Manchester became trapped in the stand under a ludicrously oversized pair of headphones and was unable to wriggle free. A team of crack civil engineers from RadioShack subsequently released the star, whose side are hot favourites as a result, though Manuel Pellegrini prefers to big up his own talent: \u201cWe have Sergio Ag\u00fcero and I am sure we will see him in a good performance.\u201d The Fiver loves an underdog, so wishes Pellegrini and his men all the best. Though when City subsequently join the European elite after becoming the latest club to deny Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in absurdly cruel fashion in the final, we\u2019ll almost certainly lose interest. A success story? A feelgood fairytale? No thanks! No thanks!

It\u2019s a long way \u2026 It\u2019s the South Coast Mariners. I met the owner, he\u2019s a great guy, an English guy. Peter Storrie\u2019s involved and they\u2019ve got an English coach as well.

Photograph: David Gray/Reuters    FIVER LETTERS \u201cFollowing Bayern\u2019s defeat to Atl\u00e9tico, I was pondering the similarities between Pep Guardiola and the soon-to-be-ex-Queen\u2019s Celtic\u2019s Ronny Deila. Both have spent the last few seasons successfully winning the league in a country where it\u2019s almost harder not to, while consistently underachieving in Europe. Interesting that Pep is universally adored in Munich and feted as one of the best managers in the world while Ronny will leave Glasgow as the least popular Queen\u2019s Celtic boss since the unmitigated disaster that was EhJohnEhBarnes\u201d \u2013 Adam Pinder. \u201cLooks like Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 will get a ban for eye gouging. Having seen the incident, I feel the FA needs to assemble an expert team to scour all footage of the Stamford Bridge handbags, specifically scratching, pinching, flicking, pushing and pulling of pigtails. I suspect four or five well drilled primary school teachers with playground experience should get the job done\u201d \u2013 Marten Allen. \u201cDoes The Fiver have anything to do with this?\u201d \u2013 Sir Bob.  \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

BITS AND BOBS The aforementioned tremendous entertainment at Stamford Bridge on Monday night has resulted in \u2026 a violent conduct charge for Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, and Chelsea and Spurs being charged with failing to control their players. Having successfully extended Bayern Munich\u2019s holidays with a third consecutive Big Cup semi-final exit, Pep Guardiola doesn\u2019t know why everyone\u2019s on his case. \u201cEverything is good. I have done my best. The players know that,\u201d he sniffed. In what is part of a slowburn scheme to get himself a gig presenting Top Gear, Diego Simeone slapped one of his Atl\u00e9tico Madrid assistants,  Oisin Tymon  Pedro Pablo Matesanz, who was attempting to signal for a substitution the manager had asked for during his side\u2019s away-goal Big Cup semi-final win. Hamilton boss Martin Canning has called for unity after their 4-0 defeat by Kilmarnock was met by anger from fans and the club\u2019s stadium announcer, who declared there was no man of the match \u201cbecause, quite frankly, none of them deserve it\u201d. He fumed: \u201cI have since heard about it and obviously wasn\u2019t happy about it. But that will be taken care of.\u201d  Mixu Paatelainen has been ushered to the Dundee United door marked Tee Yksi after the Finnish manager steered his side unerringly to the Scottish Premiership trap door. \u201cIt has been a difficult winter,\u201d he Game of Thronesed. And the wreck of Joe Cole\u2019s post-Mourinho career will be heading to Tampa Bay when his Coventry contract expires in the summer. \u201cIt might happen pretty quickly if he can get international clearance etc,\u201d cheered Tony Mowbray, who is too busy to finish sentences these days.

When Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought Leicester City, not only did the man who makes the nameplates for the club\u2019s office doors retire on the spot, but it set in place a gamble that has now just about paid out. Claudio Ranieri watched Eden Hazard\u2019s goal against Tottenham go in while sitting in his armchair, but it wasn\u2019t long before he ended up on the ceiling. Or that\u2019s what he told Stuart James at least.  If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it looks like to see a man repeatedly pinching himself, but in digital form, read this.
