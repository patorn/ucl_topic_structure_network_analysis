  "body": "Copenhagen is cool. Now. End of story. But for those who want to see where the city is going, there are arguably two main directions to take \u2013 west, across the lakes via Queen Louise\u2019s bridge to N\u00f8rrebro, or south-west of the city centre to Vesterbro, the former red light district turned happening hub. Both are begging to be explored by bike, and while they definitely have a more breathable, village-y feel when compared to the compact old centre, both cram in more urban delights than some major cities.   Related: Gastronomy, art and design: the best of classy Copenhagen    It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess what Hans Christian Andersen would have made of N\u00f8rrebro. Just a stone\u2019s throw from his grave in the bucolic Assistens cemetery \u2013 which is as lovely as any city park \u2013 are some of the coolest, funkiest streets in Copenhagen. Cobbled J\u00e6gersborggade, with its Michelin-starred restaurants, third-wave cafes, wine bars and vintage shops, is already established as a sort of edgy alternative to Str\u00f8get, the popular retail promenade in central Copenhagen. Of course, it\u2019s hipster heaven and you can feast on organic porridge, browse for retro gear and explore the high end of Copenhagen\u2019s coffee scene, but there are also some 40 galleries showcasing work from the city\u2019s famous art and design scene. While the accent here is on youth culture, plenty of more senior collectors and curators are also to be found scanning the art spaces for the next big thing.

Photograph: VisitDenmark    Before leaving N\u00f8rrebro, make sure you pedal through Superkilen \u2013 not only is it a kilometre-long park with bike lanes, it\u2019s a public space dedicated to Copenhagen\u2019s beating multicultural heart. Vesterbro, which can very easily be segued into the same cycle trip as a cruise through N\u00f8rrebro, boasts its own Meatpacking District, with dive bars and fine dining set side by side, much like its New York equivalent. Divided into white, grey and brown sections \u2013 according to the colour of their buildings \u2013 the once grubby, unloved area is now a major nightlife destination for students and party people. Whether you want to shop or window shop, head to Istedgade for antiques, designer gear and cycling clobber, or Vesterbrogade for the best in furniture and kids\u2019 clothing. You\u2019ll find your walk punctuated with fab restaurants and cosy coffee shops, and a turn down tucked-away V\u00e6rnedamsvej will reveal several smart delis, cafes and restaurants. The Carlsberg museum is part of an interesting development for Vesterbro. The enormous former brewing plant is being transformed into a \u201cmicrocity\u201d, comprising a museum showcasing the history of the famous lager, a couple of bars, a restaurant, and a pop-up area where locals sell second-hand clothes. There\u2019s also a \u201cclimbing forest\u201d \u2013 that is, a climbing trail along wooden platforms and zipwires. Finally, whiz over to Papir\u00f8en or Paper Island \u2013 where the newsprint for the Danish Press was once stored \u2013 to see Copenhagen\u2019s Street Food Market. Snacks, wraps, full meals and deli dishes from all over the world are served out of the back of trucks, and can be eaten in the warehouse halls or al fresco on the waterfront. The accent is on tastiness and sustainability \u2013 nothing comes from far away and everything is made fresh on site. Oh, and a meal costs from just DKK50 \u2013 about a fiver.     The harbour bath at Islands Brygge. Photograph: VisitDenmark    If you\u2019re not a cyclist, you can do all of the above on foot. Whatever mode of transport you opt for, wind up your edgeland exploration with a swim in the harbour bath at Islands Brygge \u2013 an urban pool open year-round that can accommodate up to 600 swimmers. On sunny days it fills up and is a major meeting place.  Alternatively, head to the award-winning Kastrup sea bath, or \u201cthe snail\u201d as the locals have dubbed it \u2013 which is built of an African hardwood called azob\u00e9 and is simply one of the most beautiful bathing structures on earth.
