Earlier this month, Price appeared as a panellist on an edition of Loose Women discussing a blog posted on Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle website Goop. The blog advised women to invest in sex toys to rev up their sex lives.   Related: Katie Price in therapy review \u2013 she gave nothing away but a few tears of her won choosing    Price appeared as a panellist on Loose Women alongside Janet Street Porter, Colleen Nolan and Ruth Langsford. The glamour model turned author and TV personality made a number of explicit comments, including owning a \u201ccrystal butt plug\u201d and the use of vegetables. Nolan pretended to march her off the show after her comments grew more outrageous, but she was later allowed back on air.          Katie Price on ITV\u2019s Loose Women    Ofcom received 13 complaints from members of the public offended by the 37-year-old\u2019s comments on morning TV. Broadcaster ITV received three complaints about the show. The regulator assessed the complaints but decided a full investigation into whether there had been a breach of the broadcasting code was not warranted as Price\u2019s comments were \u201clight-hearted\u201d. \u201cWe considered this light-hearted and generally inexplicit conversation was broadly in keeping with the expectations of the likely audience,\u201d said an Ofcom spokesman.  \u201cWe assessed a handful of complaints the sexual nature of a discussion led by panellist Katie Price, but won\u2019t be taking the matter forward for investigation.\u201d Ofcom is still considering complaints about Price\u2019s disabled son Harvey swearing live on Loose Women last Tuesday.  The 13-year-old appeared on the show as part of a discussion on online bullying when he was asked \u201cIf someone says something horrible to Harvey what do you say?\u201d He then used the C-word.  Another panellist, Andrea McLean, immediately said: \u201cWe apologise for that. But this is one of the reasons that we wanted to do this live.\u201d Price said producers had considered filming the interview in advance, but she added: \u201cI want people to see what he\u2019s like, not manufacture and edit what he\u2019s like.\u201d Explaining why she had brought him on Loose Women, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve come to the show obviously about the trolling, a few months ago I came on because the most disgusting things were said about Harvey, some of which I wouldn\u2019t be able to say on air. \u201cIt was important to bring Harvey on air because people can see what he\u2019s like, how vulnerable he is.\u201d Viewers quickly posted messages of support on Twitter.     @MissKatiePrice I know he just swore on TV, by mistake, but probably the best response he could say to trolls!! Well done Harvey! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4d\u2014 Louise Charles (@Louisecharles) May 17, 2016      lol I think Harvey's Response was right with what he said on loose women to the people who troll him #loosewomen\u2014 jem \u2654 (@calliescutie) May 17, 2016    Piers Morgan, who was a guest on Wednesday\u2019s Loose Women, said: \u201cThere are probably some idiots at home already firing away on their keyboards after hearing him swear because they think it\u2019s funny.  \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it is funny to mock Harvey. He\u2019s got great courage, a great sense of humour and his mum does an incredible job of looking after him.\u201d ITV received one direct complaint about the show.",
