  "body": "Louis van Gaal may avoid the risk of Anthony Martial aggravating a hamstring problem by leaving him out of Manchester United\u2019s crucial game at West Ham United on Tuesday. It is understood the striker travelled with the rest of the squad on Monday and faces a fitness test to determine whether he can be involved in the match-day 18. The Frenchman hurt the tendon while warming up for the 1-0 victory at Norwich City on Saturday and was replaced in the starting XI by Ander Herrera.   Related: Manchester United can scent City\u2019s blood in the race for fourth place    After Manchester City could only draw with Arsenal on Sunday, United have control of their destiny before their last two matches. If West Ham are defeated, then Bournemouth in the final outing at Old Trafford on Sunday, Van Gaal\u2019s team will finish in the top four even if City win at Swansea City in their last match. Yet with United also facing Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on 21\u00a0May, Van Gaal is clear Martial will not be selected if there is any chance of the injury worsening. \u201cI cannot say because we have to wait,\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cIf his muscles are still tight I don\u2019t take any risks because he is a very important player. We don\u2019t want a rupture and that is very important for us.\u201d Van Gaal is intent his side must ignore the emotion involved in West Ham\u2019s final game at Upton Park as they push for Champions League qualification. Given the home crowd will be particularly feverish and drive Slaven Bilic\u2019s side on, Van Gaal wants his players focused solely on winning. The manager said: \u201cOn Tuesday we have to play against an opponent who says goodbye to the stadium so they don\u2019t want to lose. They have already lost to Manchester United in the last FA Cup match [in the quarter-final]. That\u2019s also history. It\u2019s not good for us and West Ham United are a very good team. \u201cWe have a lot of respect for West Ham United. They are a historical big club in England, in the Premier League. We don\u2019t want to spoil their party but we need the three points. That\u2019s different. It is a big night and I think the players shall feel that also.\u201d Marcus Rashford and Daley Blind did not travel to Norwich last week as they were rested. Van Gaal may have done the same again with any player who may be tired. He said: \u201cIt is always dependable on the data from my fatigue specialist. \u201cWe are going home and Sunday [was] recovery and the day after is recovery. I have to decide then on the data of my fatigue specialist who I am taking with me. It\u2019s always like that. It can happen that I leave players at home because they are too tired.\u201d",
