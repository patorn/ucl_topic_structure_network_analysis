  "body": "Sam Tomkins believes it may take him a few weeks to produce his best form in a Wigan shirt but says he will not be a \u201cweak link\u201d when he makes his comeback this weekend from the injury which has plagued him for more than a year. Tomkins has not played since his final appearance for New Zealand Warriors in August last year after initially injuring his knee five months before that. But following an off-season operation and subsequent six-month lay-off he will make his second debut for Wigan against Hull on Friday after the Warriors coach, Shaun Wane, confirmed he will return, most likely from the bench. Tomkins admitted that he did not expect to be at his best straight away but said he would still have plenty to offer. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be coming out Friday and performing to my very best,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the fans will probably expect it \u2013 they\u2019ll probably be wanting to get rid of me after the weekend if I don\u2019t bring my best game! I\u2019m realistic, but I\u2019ll certainly add something to the team on Friday, I\u2019m not going to be a weak link, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Tomkins also revealed the extent and timeline of the injury which ruled him out of both the end of the National Rugby League season and England\u2019s international programme last year. \u201cIt\u2019s been the same injury all the way through,\u201d he said. \u201cI snapped my posterior cruciate ligament in March last year and I had around eight weeks off. The medical staff told me I could play when I feel ready and I was putting my hand up to play every week \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t ready. Playing on it meant I damaged the surface of my femur and it then became clear I needed another operation.\u201d Wane admitted that the way Tomkins\u2019s injury was handled by the Auckland side was not the same course of action Wigan would have taken had he been with them. \u201cHe\u2019s had a major operation and he wasn\u2019t right in New Zealand: it wasn\u2019t how we\u2019d have treated him,\u201d Wane said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a superb medical team and there was never going to be any rush. I don\u2019t know how their medical team works but I know it\u2019s very different to what we do here, we\u2019d have dealt with it differently.\u201d Wane also weighed into the debate about player welfare, saying that if he had his way there would be more games in the domestic calendar, not fewer. His comments come after the Huddersfield prop Eorl Crabtree called for a reduction in games after an unprecedented amount of injuries in 2016 throughout Super League. \u201cThese guys aren\u2019t mixing concrete in the rain, they\u2019re coming in and doing weights with top medical staff and the best supplements,\u201d Wane said. \u201cI wish we had more games; I\u2019d look after my players and give more debuts out. If we had a break I\u2019d be bored stiff, and so would my players. I want a bigger squad and to have more games.\u201d",
