The majority of these are solitary bees, as well as over 24 species of bumblebee and 1 honey bee. , 2:B - Rice, like wheat and other grains, is wind pollinated. We would eat rice, pasta and porridge in a world without bees, but the quality and quantity of our food choices would be very dull. No strawberry jam! , 3:C - Bees pollinate 75% of the 100 most globally-traded crops. , 4:A - 1 \u2013 Only honey bees make honey, but all bees are important and help pollinate , 5:D - Bees visit plants for pollen and nectar.

They may also drink water from some plants. , 6:B - If you wear cotton, you should thank the bees for putting the shirt on your back., 7:B - The main cause is the loss of their habitat. This has been driven by how we farm and build things. Exposure to pesticides is also a factor compounding the problem. Pests and diseases are also harmful, especially in honey bees. Studies show that climate change is also starting to have an effect \u2013 for example, the flowering of plants being out of step with when bees are seeking food., 8:A - We can all be \u2018beekeepers\u2019 just by growing the right plants, shrubs, trees and vegetables for all types of bee \u2013 honey, bumble and solitary. Avoid the use of garden and household pesticides and herbicides., 9:B - Only a third of people got this right in a recent YouGov poll.\n    Scores\n    \n     5 and above.Not bad.\n     8 and above.Buzzing brilliant! \n     0 and above.Oh dear.",
