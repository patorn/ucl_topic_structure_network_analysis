  "body": "The Leave.EU campaign has been fined \u00a350,000 for sending more than half a million spam texts. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said the company running the campaign to leave the EU at June\u2019s referendum, Better for the Country Ltd, had broken the law by sending messages to people who had not given their consent. The ICO\u2019s head of enforcement, Stephen Eckersley, said: \u201cPolitical parties and campaign groups must follow the same rules as anyone else. That means they must have people\u2019s permission before sending them text messages. \u201cBetter for the Country did not have permission to send these messages. After considering all the options we decided that enforcement action was necessary.\u201d The Leave.EU campaign, which is backed by Ukip but is separate to the Vote Leave campaign supported by senior conservatives including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, said it had purchased the list of mobile numbers from a third party.  However, Ecklersly said those who had given their numbers should have been clearly told they would be receiving messages from the campaign.    Related: Canadian who took on Facebook named UK information commissioner    Instead they signed up to information about topics such as leisure, home improvements and insurance, with no specification about EU politics. Eckersley said: \u201cThe consent wasn\u2019t clear. Local and national government was as specific as it got: there was no mention of leaving the EU.\u201d Leave.EU did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The ICO has previously fined other political campaigns for their misuse of data. In December, it fined the Telegraph \u00a330,000 for sending out thousands of emails during last year\u2019s election, urging readers to vote Conservative even though many had only signed up for editorial content. In March it fined Labour MP David Lammy \u00a35,000 over more than 30,000 recorded calls relating to his failed bid to become London\u2019s candidate for mayor.",
