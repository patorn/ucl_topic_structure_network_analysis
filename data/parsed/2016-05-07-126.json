  "body": "It was the start of a new year and\u00a0my father and I were trying to avoid discussing death. To be\u00a0precise, his. He had been diagnosed with stage 3 kidney cancer seven years earlier, just months after the publication of\u00a0his first book, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. His illness had stalked his\u00a0subsequent publishing career like\u00a0a\u00a0bitter, mordant rival, thwarting him\u00a0where possible. Symptoms made sitting at a\u00a0desk to write painful and uncomfortable. Toxic side effects from treatments drained him of energy. Hospital appointments nixed literary festival invitations. Yet he never complained, and, thanks in part to the same toxic drugs, did produce, remarkably, seven novels and two novellas over the next seven years. But now his system could no longer tolerate the medication, and he was in decline. So when on this cold January morning, looking pale and gaunt, he told me he was writing a\u00a0new book, I felt a surge of hope. It\u00a0was called The Death of an Owl, he told me, and was about an ambitious politician who runs over an owl by mistake and tries to cover it up, with disastrous consequences. I felt excited. Not just about the book, which sounded promising, but because I saw light flicker in my father\u2019s eyes as\u00a0he told me this. Physically he didn\u2019t seem up to much, but over the next few months, as I checked in with him, he informed me that his first draft was progressing well \u2013 although he was worried that the complex cocktail of pain relief he was taking might have confused his\u00a0writing in places. At the same time it was clear that the process, and his determination to finish the story, was keeping him going. But by that autumn, it was obvious Dad was going to need more than a\u00a0publishing deadline to get through to\u00a0another year. He didn\u2019t seem to be writing any more. In fact, he wasn\u2019t doing much at all by December, and the doctor summoned my brother and me to his bedside. There was no\u00a0more talk of books. (Although, in\u00a0a\u00a0strange reversal, I found myself reading him his favourite passages from The Hobbit over the last few nights of\u00a0his life, just as he had done for me when I was a child.) He died just\u00a0before Christmas. The following April, I finally began dealing with my father\u2019s papers. I say papers, but as this was 2014, I really mean his hard drive \u2013 there were very few actual papers. I came across a document called \u201cDeath of an Owl \u2013 true version\u201d. It was certainly the only version I found. Sitting alone in my study at home, I began to read, fearing that I\u00a0would encounter some exposure of him at his weakest and most vulnerable \u2013 morphine-fuelled non sequiturs or revelations. It was the opposite: the prose was him at his most elegant and thoughtful. I found myself enjoying his writing in\u00a0a\u00a0way I hadn\u2019t for a while, savouring\u00a0a\u00a0lightness of touch and a wit that recalled Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. I\u00a0was gripped. And then it stopped, two-thirds of the way through, quite\u00a0abruptly. It was a really good book \u2013 could be even better if it had an ending. I knew how much he had wanted to tell this story, how it had kept him going through his final days. I began to wonder. The writer in me responded instinctively to the first-person narrator\u2019s voice, the political and media milieu he had created on the page. Could I do the job for him? And did I dare? He hadn\u2019t asked me to, and I hadn\u2019t presumed to ask him if\u00a0he wanted me to. I wrote children\u2019s books about talking animals; he normally wrote mainstream literary fiction about the country-house set. I spoke to my agent. She was intrigued and as supportive as ever, but wisely cautioned, \u201cNo one will thank you for it, darling.\u201d     Paul Torday in 2010. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian    And, of course, she was right. How many times are forgotten books or films or stories dug up from some attic and posthumously released by well-meaning executors to breathless pre\u2011publicity but often disappointing effect? Too often, the pieces in question were unpublished for a reason, and their existence remains of specialist literary critical interest only. So began a game of literary detection, scouring my father\u2019s electronic and paper files for anything that would give me a clue as to how he intended the plot\u00a0to resolve. I found two documents entitled \u201cDeath of an Owl: Synopsis\u201d, which at first, maddeningly, I couldn\u2019t open. Eventually, after hours on internet forums, I was in. They were dated close together, but with subtle and significant differences in the storyline. Which one should I choose? The later version would be obvious, but in places the only extant manuscript bore more resemblance to the earlier synopsis. Planning for my own books was full of similar inconsistencies, but I could make sense of those. I realised that if\u00a0I\u00a0was going to do this, at some point I\u00a0would have to stop playing detective scholar with my father\u2019s work, stop being the reverential son, and start being the writer. But writing the first few words after his felt anything but reverential. My first words of adult fiction, and I felt as though I was impersonating, dressing up as my own father. Could anything be more childlike? And yet, page after page, I began to slip into his voice and his style, almost hearing my father in\u00a0my head, guiding me to his story\u2019s conclusion. After a while, looking back, it was hard to tell where his words finished and mine began. \u2022 The Death of an Owl is published by Weidenfeld &\u00a0Nicolson.",
