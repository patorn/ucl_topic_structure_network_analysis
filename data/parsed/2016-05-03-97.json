  "body": "You might not have heard of skate brand Palace, but you will almost certainly have seen their logo. A triangle with Palace written along each side, it\u2019s spotted on the backs of hoodies worn by suburban teenagers, on shirts worn by Jay Z, on boys staring at the big screen in pubs, on the dancefloor of gay clubs and, in 2014, on England shirts produced by Umbro. It has even, thanks to her dad\u2019s tailor, been worn by North West, the indisputable trendsetter of the toddler world. Ring a bell now? Thought so.

When the ex-skater set up Palace in 2009 on a wing and a prayer, one thing was non-negotiable: the logo had to be supersized. \u201cThat was a big thing for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI told the factory: \u2018Can you make the logo as big as it will go on the back of the shirt, as far as the seam will allow \u2026\u2019 I\u2019m quite a garish person, I think.\u201d Over the following seven years his hits have all been logo-heavy. They include a T-shirt with a Versace-like Medusa (worn by Rihanna) and a similar take on Chanel\u2019s double Cs. It\u2019s cheeky, with the right references, and popular with a varied demographic from Dover Street Market shoppers to young teenagers. \u201cDads come in and buy shit, it makes me so happy,\u201d Tanju says. \u201cWe have sons and dads coming in. I\u2019m like \u2018yes\u2019 \u2013 because dad wants to be cool at work.\u201d     Rihanna in Palace\u2019s Versace-like Medusa T-shirt in 2012. Photograph: Jun Sato/WireImage    At the store in Soho, London, there are queues outside for each new drop of stock. When I visit on a weekday afternoon, there\u2019s a steady stream of teenagers with their parents, US tourists and actual skaters. This regular supply of eager customers is down to a treat-\u2019em-mean, keep-\u2019em-keen policy: Palace only produces small runs of each design. Tanju says this is due to his short attention span, and a kind of Panini sticker \u201cgot-need\u201d appeal. \u201cThere\u2019s a constant flow of little things,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople come in to the shop, grab it and go, and then are like: \u2018I didn\u2019t get a particular T-shirt, why didn\u2019t I get it?\u2019 It\u2019s quite fun.\u201d Tanju, a likable, grinning 33-year-old, has an infectious teenage energy that runs through his brand. On the day we meet, he is wearing Rupert Bear checked trousers, Palace sweatshirt and a cap. He is responsible for the product descriptions on the website, which have a cult following among Palace fans. Forget practical details on fabrics: a bomber is \u201c112% gully\u201d (authentic and street, to anyone over 30). A sweatshirt is explained with the words \u201cI\u2019m craving deep-fried fucking cheese\u201d. \u201cI sit in front the TV with a takeaway and type on my iPhone absolute nonsense in bullet points and people find it funny,\u201d he says. The culinary references are down to his penchant for the Food Network.     A tracksuit top for Palace SS16 . Photograph: Angelo Pennetta    Part of Palace\u2019s ability to keep its cool while growing as a business is down to that unbottleable thing: authenticity. Tanju lives and breathes skate culture, and talks fondly of spending 12-hour days skating at the Southbank skate undercroft as a teenager. He started making videos of his friends\u2019 tricks, and Palace, the label, followed, initially as a way to sponsor skaters, and named in ironic tribute to the scuzzy flat Tanju lived in at the time. He partnered with friend Gareth Skewis and signed skaters Blondey, Chewy and Lucien, who still work with the company now. \u201cWe have a backbone,\u201d says Tanju. \u201cThere\u2019s a skate gang and a crew of people.\u201d Tanju grew up in south London, the son of a Turkish ex-pro footballer father and English mother who worked in the family restaurant. Together they ran Jack\u2019s Place, a restaurant in Clapham where Jack Nicholson and Bros ate. \u201cThere would be two massive bouncers outside, and Bros were inside having a Sunday lunch, back when Bros were Bros,\u201d he says. There is quite a lot of nostalgia for the 90s in Palace \u2013 from the T-shirt with a \u201cMitsubishi\u201d pill on it (the favoured brand of ecstasy in the decade), to references to films such as Terminator and laddy staples including signet rings. This, no doubt, appeals to the Palace customers who were around at the time and those who are discovering it now in a #retrolol way. \u201cI guess it\u2019s when I was young and I could do whatever I wanted,\u201d says Tanju. \u201cIt\u2019s a banging time to think about.\u201d      A tracksuit for Palace SS16. Photograph: Angelo Pennetta    Ultimately, Palace\u2019s success might be down to something really simple: Tanju is entrenched in the cool crowd but he is anything but a snob. He thinks it\u2019s great when his mum texts him to say she saw someone in a Palace T-shirt in Liverpool, and he sheepishly admits to a past that involved \u201cworking in every skate shop in London\u201d selling micro-scooters to children. He says he rarely \u201cseeds\u201d clothes to celebrities such as West, in the hope they\u2019ll post a selfie on Instagram: \u201cWe make it and that\u2019s it. If you want it, come to the shop. If someone really nice phones up [for a T-shirt], then of course. If Elton John rang up, I would be like, \u2018Sure Elton John.\u2019\u201d Elton John in a Palace T-shirt? It\u2019s only a matter of time.",
