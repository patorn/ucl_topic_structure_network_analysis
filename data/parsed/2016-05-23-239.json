  "body": "Romelu Lukaku has admitted he is expecting to leave Everton this summer \u201cand knows where he wants to go\u201d. Speculation over the Belgium striker\u2019s future has been mounting, with his former club Chelsea interested in bringing him back to Stamford Bridge. Last week, Lukaku\u2019s father Roger revealed that he would like the 23-year-old to move to either Manchester United or Bayern Munich, adding that he expected the deal to be struck before the start of Euro 2016. Now Lukaku himself has added fuel to the fire by suggesting he would be open to leaving the Premier League. \u201cIn my head I know where I want to go but I\u2019m keeping that to myself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will know when it is concluded. I have to make a good choice but in my head that has happened already. I have played [in England] for five years now, it\u2019s my league. But there are other nice clubs. I follow Spanish and German football and I also have something for the Italian league. \u201cWherever I go I want to win prizes,\u201d he added. \u201cDuring Leicester\u2019s title ceremony I was standing just 10 metres from the trophy. I just stared at it for two minutes, forgetting to get on with the warm-up. I thought to myself, I want that.\u201d Lukaku, who scored 18 Premier League goals as Everton ended the season in 11th place, also admitted that there was a breakdown in the relationship between the players and their former manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez. \u201cThe team did not perform at all. We won two of our last 11 games. When things are broken between the manager and the players it become difficult,\u201d Lukaku said as he began preparations with Belgium for next month\u2019s European Championship.
