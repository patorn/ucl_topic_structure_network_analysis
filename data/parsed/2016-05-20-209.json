  "body": "The last time Nicolas Winding Refn premiered a film at Cannes \u2013 the violent, stylish thriller Only God Forgives (2013), starring a near-mute Ryan Gosling \u2013 the closing credits were soundtracked by boos, broken by the occasional whoop. On Thursday, history repeated itself as the crowd at the Palais expressed a largely hostile \u2013 but sporadically ecstatic \u2013 response to Refn\u2019s latest, a lavishly-graphic horror set among Los Angeles supermodels.    Related: The Neon Demon review: Nicolas Winding Refn makes Zoolander 3, but erotic and evil    Speaking on Friday, Refn declared himself happy with the response. \u201cBaby, we\u2019re search and destroy,\u201d he said. The reactions, he declared, were \u201cpunk rock. Fuck the establishment. Take it or leave it but you cannot deny it. \u201cIf we don\u2019t split [opinion], what are we doing here?\u201d continued the director, whose first film to screen at Cannes, Drive (2011), met with near-universal praise. \u201cArt is not about good or bad, guys. Those days are over. The internet has changed film as an experience. Good or bad is Chinese food, or the pepper steak you had at whatever French bistro last night. \u201cIf you don\u2019t react, what are you doing here? Why would you waste your time? There\u2019s so many other things that are worth doing than watching a movie or TV show just to consume time.\u201d Such a stance was crucial, Refn stressed. \u201cWhatever you got, I\u2019ll tear it down, and I\u2019ll give you something else instead. I want my children to have the same attitude. Have integrity. Take no prisoners. Don\u2019t compromise on life or anything.\u201d Refn was holding court at a lively press conference, in which he also described his countryman Lars Von Trier of having \u201cdone a lot of drugs\u201d and being \u201cover the hill\u201d. Refn, whose father, Anders, is Von Trier\u2019s long-time editor, added that the last time he had seen the director (who was declared persona non grata by Cannes in 2011 for a joke in which he expressed sympathy for Hitler), Von Trier had \u201ctried to tell my wife he wanted to have sex with her\u201d. \u201cI told him to fuck off,\u201d explained Refn. \u201cSo he found some other slut.\u201d The Neon Demon is Refn\u2019s first film with a female protagonist: Jesse, played by Elle Fanning, who makes her way to Los Angeles aged 16 to seek her fortune as a model. She swiftly finds success, to the opprobrium of other models, who find unconventional revenge. As well as featuring vampirism and cannibalism, the film also features a memorable morgue-set sex scene.  Asked if he felt today\u2019s society was inherently necrophiliac, Refn said \u201cas a metaphor, that\u2019s spot on\u201d. \u201cDeath and beauty has now become one, because the digital revolution has and is in the process of creating an alternative universe that my children and their children will live within almost as if it was a real world\u201d.

I think there is something very terrifying in thinking the world can only be about beauty. The reality is that it\u2019s an obsession that has only grown, even though was try to rationalise it.\u201d Refn, who frequently shoots commercials for clothing brands, including David Beckham\u2019s campaign for H&M, said his experience of the fashion industry was that \u201cany environment that is so much focused on how you look is extremely harsh because it really comes on how were you born. And that itself is such a horrible world to live in, where the reality is so extreme. it\u2019s very intoxicating but it\u2019s very frightening.\u201d Last night Refn and Fanning had attended the amfAR gala, a glitzy fundraiser for Aids research charities, which had acted, said the director, as pre-prom party for the actor, who is missing her own high school prom on Friday night. It was also, he said, an instructive sight in light of the movie, which suggests cosmetic surgery is both fundamentally suspect and always possible to detect. \u201cThere was a lot of plastic surgery at amfAR,\u201d said Refn. \u201cSo it was pretty easy to see who was who. We were the normal couple.\u201d",
