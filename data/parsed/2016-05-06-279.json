Major figures in the Welsh wing of the party \u2013 including the leader, Carwyn Jones, and former Welsh secretary Peter Hain \u2013 suggested the campaign had been hindered by Labour\u2019s troubles elsewhere in the UK. The party\u2019s total of 29 seats \u2013 just short of a majority in the 60-seat assembly \u2013 coupled with the fractured nature of the opposition means it could choose to govern as a minority administration.  As expected, Ukip won its first seats at the assembly, with the former Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless among the seven who will take up seats at Cardiff Bay. Reckless said the party would be constructive but not part of a \u201ccosy consensus\u201d.  Hamilton said he was looking forward to a return to mainstream politics, nearly 20 years after losing his Westminster seat following Guardian revelations that he had been involved in a cash-for-questions scandal. It was a bad election for the Tories, who failed to win seats they believed were in their grasp. The party slipped into third place with 11 seats, while the Liberal Democrats were left with just a single representative, their leader, Kirsty Williams. Leanne Wood, the leader of Plaid Cymru,  achieved the shock of the night when she won the Rhondda constituency seat from Leighton Andrews, a Labour stalwart and minister in the last administration. Plaid took 12 seats, becoming the second biggest party in the assembly. In her acceptance speech, Wood said: \u201cA new dawn has broken over these Rhondda valleys. It is too early to tell whether a new political dawn will break over the entire nation.\u201d Speaking in Cardiff on Friday, Jones said he would discuss the possible shape of the fifth assembly with Plaid and the Lib Dems. He insisted he would not work with the Tories or Ukip.  \u201cPeople will look to us to form a government as by far the largest party. We have to do that fairly quickly. We have a steel crisis that has to be dealt with. The last thing people want is uncertainty,\u201d he said. Asked about the divisions within Labour on the UK level and the row over antisemitism, Jones said: \u201cIt\u2019s not helped. I\u2019m not going to pretend otherwise. The lesson is that it\u2019s really important for politicians in London not to say things that are not helpful to colleagues in the UK.\u201d There will be much soul-searching over the loss of the Rhondda seat and the narrowness of the party\u2019s victory in nearby Blaenau Gwent, where a 9,000 majority melted away to 650. Jones described the Rhondda result as a \u201chuge disappointment\u201d and admitted he did not know what had gone wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we saw coming. At this stage it\u2019s not clear,\u201d he said. Jones said the party would analyse why its share of the vote had fallen (down 7.6% in the 40 constituencies since 2011). \u201cWe still have work to do,\u201d he said.  Asked if Jeremy Corbyn was unhelpful toWelsh Labour, Jones said: \u201cThis is a Welsh election. With any political party some people don\u2019t like the leader. Jeremy wasn\u2019t a significant issue at this election.\u201d The Labour leader visited Wales this week. Jones said: \u201cWe were saying to people: \u2018This is a Welsh election. I\u2019m the party\u2019s candidate for first minister.\u2019\u201d Jones, however, has not hidden his frustration with the antisemitism row centred on Ken Livingstone. On the lessons the UK party could learn from Welsh Labour, he said: \u201cWe think the key is to connect with people as much as possible and to be on the street meeting people. The key to yesterday\u2019s victory was the amount of time knocking on doors and phoning people.\u201d Lord Hain said: \u201cYou would have expected us to be doing better in our heartland seats. There are questions for UK Labour.\u201d The defeated Andrews said problems within the UK party were having an impact on Wales. \u201cYou can\u2019t mobilise voters at a local level if the party is divided at a UK level,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lessons to be learned.\u201d But there were some encouraging results for Labour. In Cardiff Central, Jenny Rathbone fought off a spirited charge by the Lib Dems. Julie Morgan, wife of the former first minister and Welsh Labour leader Rhodri, clung on to Cardiff North with a majority of 3,667. The Ukip UK leader, Nigel Farage, hailed a \u201cbreakthrough night\u201d for the party and joked that the money he had spent on the Severn Bridge tolls (which Ukip wants to scrap) had paid off. \u201cI\u2019ve been going back and forth to Wales paying those ridiculous tolls. Looks like it\u2019ll be worth it,\u201d he said. Kirsty Williams quit as leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats after the party lost all but one of its seats in Cardiff Bay. Although she held her own seat in Brecon and Radnorshire with an increased majority, the Lib Dems lost four seats. In a letter announcing her decision, she said that \u201cdespite our best efforts, and a positive campaign, it has not been enough\u201d, adding, \u201cI must take responsibility\u201d.",
