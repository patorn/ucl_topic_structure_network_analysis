  "body": "Malarndirri McCarthy, a former minister in the Northern Territory government and ABC presenter, has won preselection to replace Labor senator Nova Peris. On Monday Labor\u2019s national executive selected McCarthy to top the ALP Senate ticket in the Northern Territory. McCarthy beat a field of four women: the Yothu Yindi Foundation chief executive, Denise Bowden, NT Labor staffer Cathryn Tilmouth, former NT Labor minister Marion Scrymgour and Peris\u2019s chief of staff, Ursula Raymond.   Related: Nova Peris defends her decision to quit politics: 'I am leaving on my terms'    McCarthy received strong support from Labor\u2019s left faction. In a statement the Labor party said McCarthy had lived in the territory for most of her life and was a proud Yanyuwa Garrawa woman from Borroloola in the Gulf country in the NT. \u201cMcCarthy has a strong record as an advocate for Indigenous people, having served as a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and a minister in the Northern Territory Labor government,\u201d it said. \u201cMcCarthy has also had a distinguished career as a journalist and is a champion for promoting Aboriginal culture, particularly amongst young people. \u201cShe has been a fierce advocate for her community of Borroloola and will bring that same passion to representing the Northern Territory in the federal parliament.\u201d Labor thanked the strong field of candidates and acknowledged \u201cthe pioneering contribution of Nova Peris\u201d. Peris resigned on Tuesday after reports she was seeking the top Indigenous position at the AFL.  Peris\u2019s resignation was criticised by some commentators, as it came midway through an eight-week election campaign and without warning to the Labor leader, Bill Shorten. On Thursday Peris hit back at critics. \u201cUntil you are an Aboriginal person, do not criticise me for the decisions I have made,\u201d she told media in Darwin. Asked why she hadn\u2019t announced she would be stepping down earlier, Peris said: \u201cI didn\u2019t call the election.\u201d When she nominated for the Senate spot on Tuesday, McCarthy said: \u201cI have a deep passion for pursuing a better way of life for all Territorians.\u201d McCarthy promised to to be a \u201cfierce advocate for the territory and Indigenous Australians in a Shorten Labor government\u201d.           Nova Peris says \u2018no one should judge me\u2019 as she explains Senate exit",
