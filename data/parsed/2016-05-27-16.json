  "body": "Hull\u2019s Robert Snodgrass has warned the Sheffield Wednesday forward Fernando Forestieri not to ruin Saturday\u2019s Championship play off final at Wembley by diving. The winger remembers Forestieri \u2013 who has a reputation for going down rather easily \u2013 being sent off for diving when the teams drew 0-0 at the KC Stadium in February and does not want to witness a repeat. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to win at Wembley by cheating,\u201d said Snodgrass, who has proved a key component in Steve Bruce\u2019s side since returning to the first-team in December following 15 months out with a knee injury. \u201cWhen Wednesday played us here I would have sent him off earlier, I think he dived about four times in the first half. I thought Forestieri was terrible for the game. It\u2019s a contact sport but you don\u2019t want somebody cheating. It\u2019s cheating the referee. The referee has a hard enough job as it is.\u201d Snodgrass believes the yellow card for a second \u2018dive\u2019 which eventually secured Forestieri, Wednesday\u2019s leading scorer, his red card at Hull had something to do with him crying wolf earlier. \u201cWhen you look back at the decision to send him off, it was the one where he probably hadn\u2019t dived,\u201d said Snodgrass. \u201cHe killed himself by diving in the first half. If he\u2019d been in my team I\u2019d have told him to get a grip.\u201d Snodgrass believes the match officials will need to keep a close eye on Forestieri on Saturday. \u201cHe\u2019s been sent off a few times for diving. It\u2019s not good for the game,\u201d Snodgrass added. \u201cThere\u2019s better ways of helping your team-mates \u2013 if you get sent off, you let them down.\u201d",
