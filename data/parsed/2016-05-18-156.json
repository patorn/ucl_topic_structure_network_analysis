Last week\u2019s needlessly late arrival of the team bus to Upton Park brought questions for Bulova, \u201cThe Official Timekeeping Partner of Manchester United\u201d. But at least United were at that stage still on schedule to finish the season on time. Since then, you may have discerned a little upset caused by what we\u2019ll class as The Official Security Search Experts of Manchester United. In days gone by, time itself appeared to be a client state to the club, with temporal laws subservient to a higher form of measuring: Fergie time. Back then, United would finish top in April. Now, they\u2019re coming fifth in the second half of May. None of the above is meant to give the club what their own sources are promising the relevant \u201cidiot\u201d at Security Search Management and Solutions \u2013 namely, \u201ca right kicking\u201d. But I can\u2019t help feeling that much of the angst and the anger flying around isn\u2019t really about the pretend pipe-bomb fiasco, but about the post-Ferguson fiasco. Training devices are just something else to add to the long list entitled What We Talk About When We Talk About Fergie. Bombs in the bogs are the latest thing that many reckon \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened under Sir Alex\u201d, though the thing of all things is obviously Europa League football. The training device is just a plot device. (Sorry.) Not that the public safety implications can be entirely dismissed. However Keystone Cops it appears to have been, the pipe-bomb/search dog exercise at Old Trafford serves as a sobering reminder. The highly complex modern security threat means we are effectively engaged in conflict and proxy conflict in any number of theatres, including the Afghan theatre, the Syrian theatre, and the Theatre of Dreams. Even so, the reaction to United\u2019s cancelled game against Bournemouth on Sunday still feels absurdly overblown. A furious Greater Manchester mayor and police and crime commissioner, Tony Lloyd, has called for \u201ca full inquiry\u201d. Really? There are surely enough really horrid things happening in the world without police overlords wetting their pants about false alarms. Still, if there is an actual inquiry, I hope Sir John Chilcot does it, because I\u2019d be quite happy for it to report in the new post-Ferguson measure for elasticity: Chilcot time. Furthermore, I know that the absolute last thing Mr Lloyd would want is for the furore over the bungled Old Trafford training exercise to obscure another criticised training exercise, this time one organised by Greater Manchester police. It was, after all, only last week that a simulated suicide bombing in Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre was chided for featuring a \u201cbomber\u201d needlessly shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d as he kicked it off by detonating his own pretend explosives. There is no sense speculating on whether any of this would have happened under Sir Alex Ferguson, the former United manager having explicitly ruled himself out of mayoral contention last November. All we can do is consult our Bulova watches, and wonder whether a close season in Manchester bombing exercises is now due. Olympic pot calling the Fifa kettle black Of all the bandwagon-jumping lectures in the wake of the Fifa arrests in Zurich, the ones emanating from a hundred miles down the road in Lausanne were the hardest to stomach. To hear the International Olympic Committee pontificate at the time was to sense that a major tear had opened up in the sports-bullshit continuum. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely important for Fifa to regain credibility for Fifa,\u201d intoned the pious IOC president, Thomas Bach, \u201cso I can only advise that they work hard at reforms and work hard on addressing these grave allegations.\u201d By October he had upgraded to declare that \u201cenoughis enough\u201d, adding various instructions on \u201ccredibility\u201d. Imagine the collective lack of shock, then, as we watch the developing fallout from Tokyo\u2019s successful bid for the 2020 Olympic Games. On Tuesday, the president of Japan\u2019s Olympic Committee refused to disclose details of its contract with a shadowy account named \u201cBlack Tidings\u201d, believed to be linked to the son of the disgraced former IAAF chief Lamine Diack. (Honestly, who calls their dodgy account \u201cBlack Tidings\u201d? You\u2019re a blazer, not Magneto.) Even accounting for creative accounting, though, the biggest con in the era of sporting mega-events remains the idea of Olympic legacy. I note that in the case of Rio this has now pretty much been commuted down to a single abstract noun. For your records, it is \u201chope\u201d. Let\u2019s see it in action. \u201cThis message of hope is perhaps the most important legacy that the Olympic Games will bring Rio de Janeiro,\u201d explained Bach last month. At the lighting of the Olympic flame in Greece, the Rio organising committee president took up the baton with the claim: \u201cThe Olympic flame means hope to us all.\u201d Does it now? \u201cIt brings a message that can and will unite our dear Brazil.\u201d What it doesn\u2019t bring, according to Moody\u2019s \u2013 which in February cut Brazil\u2019s debt rating to junk status \u2013 is any hope of affecting Brazil\u2019s deepest economic recession since the 1930s, despite the usual woolly suggestions to the contrary. As the credit ratings agency insisted firmly this week: \u201cThe Games will last just one month and the associated economic stimulus pale compared to Brazil\u2019s economy.\u201d Still, you can\u2019t put a price on hope. And \u2013 much more conveniently \u2013 you can\u2019t begin to measure it.",
