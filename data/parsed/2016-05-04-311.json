  "body": "Unions, Labor and the Greens have raised concerns that a new government-subsidised youth internship scheme will lead to exploitation as employers churn through free workers rather than creating real jobs.   Related: The budget is full of old ideas but at least we get a new slogan | Edward Cavanough    But employer groups have hit back, arguing the program will reduce the risks to employers of hiring young people, by letting them trial new workers as well as provide people with valuable skills. In Tuesday\u2019s budget the treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced the government would redirect $751.7m from work for the dole to a voluntary youth internship scheme called Youth Jobs PaTH. Under the scheme, the government will pay businesses $1,000 to take on young, unemployed people as interns for up to 12 weeks. Under the scheme the interns will receive $200 on top of their fortnightly welfare payments. Businesses that employ people full-time at the end of their internships will be eligible for a youth bonus wage subsidy of between $6,500 and $10,000. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has warned the scheme would allow businesses to access a pool of free labour instead of employing workers on the minimum wage. By the ACTU\u2019s calculation, PaTH interns working 25 hours a week would receive $364 a week. That is $68 below the minimum wage and represents just a $4-an-hour improvement on the dole. Businesses would save a wages bill of $432.25 for 25 hours\u2019 work a week for each employee.

ACTU secretary, Dave Oliver, said: \u201cThis internship program is a path to nowhere \u2013 it\u2019s replacing existing entry-level jobs with a \u2018churn and burn\u2019 scheme that gives business access to free, exploitable workers. \u201cWhy would a business employ a minimum wage or lower-paid worker when the government is ready to supply them with free labour and a $1,000 handout?\u201d he asked. Oliver also noted internships could include low-skilled work such as work in supermarkets, which he said was \u201cnot a plan to create real, lasting jobs\u201d. Concerns were raised on social media about the quality of jobs PaTH interns would perform.

The training will deal with employers\u2019 expectations and explain attitudes and behaviours required to be successful in a job. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, told Guardian Australia the scheme was good for small businesses because: \u201cIt\u2019s a risk to take someone onboard, in terms of time to prepare someone to come in and supervise them. \u201cIt is important that the government has come up with a scheme we strongly support for encouraging businesses to provide for internships and prepare young people with basic employability skills, like turning up on time and taking direction on things like personal safety equipment,\u201d Pearson said. He said the $200 extra a fortnight provided an incentive for young workers, and it was misleading to compare their wages to those of permanent workers. Such a comparison also neglected that young people would benefit from skills acquisition, experience and contacts which would help them get a job at the employer or another business, he said. The scheme has also been backed by Australian Council of Social Services chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, who said it will help young people into work but safeguards were needed to prevent young workers replacing existing jobs. Labor\u2019s workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said: \u201cIf the government hadn\u2019t made significant cuts to skills and apprenticeship programs, we wouldn\u2019t need this new $751.7m program. \u201cThe Abbott-Turnbull government has ditched 122,400 apprenticeships for 120,0000 inferior internships; a four-year apprenticeship replaced with a four-week internship,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said: \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about people losing their jobs to make way for a young person who has a subsidy attached. \u201cInternships proposed by the government to reduce youth unemployment could easily result in young people being exploited and I question the long-term employment outcomes,\u201d Siewert said. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said \u201cbusiness will welcome the development of new pathways helping young people enter the workforce\u201d. \u201cBy making young people become more work-ready through pre-employment training and internships, the Youth Jobs PaTH initiative targets a leading concern of business around employability and backs these measures with accelerated and simpler wage subsidies,\u201d he said.  \u201cThese measures will assist businesses make an important contribution to improving the lifelong employment prospects of eligible young people.\u201d In Senate question time on Wednesday the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said \u201cthe best form of welfare is a job\u201d and the new scheme would give young people \u201cemployability skills and real work experience to get them a job\u201d. Cash said the program delivered \u201ca new youth jobs path, an opportunity to have a trial and then we hope to move into employment and be hired\u201d.  \u201cBased on evidence, internships actually help our young people move into a job,\u201d Cash said.  Cash told Guardian Australia the employment department would monitor the program to ensure displacement does not occur. \u201cImportantly, employers that exploit the program or job seekers will be banned from using it.\u201d",
