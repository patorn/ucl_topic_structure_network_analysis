  "body": "Alfonso Flores looked relieved. Standing at the front of the prayer hall, the 29-year-old dental technician accepted hugs and handshakes from other members of the Centro Isl\u00e1mico, America\u2019s only mosque founded specifically to be a place for Spanish-language programming for Latinos. Flores had just taken the shahada, the Islamic profession of faith, at the mosque\u2019s first-ever Cinco de Mayo celebration on Saturday, where community members with roots in Colombia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Cuba and other countries served halal variations of their traditional foods, while celebrating their shared identity as Muslims. \u201cWe\u2019re like a family,\u201d said Ana Ortiz, a Puerto Rican Muslim originally from New Jersey, who was serving food at the festival\u2019s Puerto Rico tent.  Since it opened on 30 January 2016, 18 people like Flores have taken the shahada at the mosque in Houston. There are more than 55 million people of Hispanic origin in the United States, and more than 3 million Muslims. Estimates of the number of Latino Muslims in the US range from 30,000 to 300,000. Latino Muslims have organized across the country for decades, but have had few mosques specifically built around their communities. New York\u2019s Alianza Isl\u00e1mica opened a storefront mosque in mid-1990s, but it closed down by 2005. Houston\u2019s Centro Isl\u00e1mico is among the first to organize since then.     Centro Isl\u00e1mico, America\u2019s first Spanish-language mosque. Photograph: Ryan Schuessler for the Guardian    \u201cWe used to gather in different masjids,\u201d said Magidel Morris as she served halal tamales in the mosque\u2019s parking lot on Saturday. \u201cBut then we got together and decided we had to have a place for Hispanic people to get together and learn about Islam.\u201d With the Centro Isl\u00e1mico, America\u2019s Latino muslims now have a home of their own.  \u201c[Latinos] want to learn about Islam,\u201d said Jalil Navarro, who donned a Mexican luchador mask while distributing Spanish-language Qur\u2019ans in the masjid\u2019s parking lot. \u201cbut sometimes they step into a masjid and there is no people to serve them if they don\u2019t speak English.\u201d  Islam in Spanish, the organization that founded the mosque, was formed to fill that gap. Founded in 2001 by Colombian American convert Jaime Fletcher, the organization produces Spanish-language programming and Islamic educational materials that are distributed throughout the Americas. Today there are more than 1,000 Latino Muslims affiliated with the organization.     \u2018We had to have a place for Hispanic people to get together and learn about Islam.\u2019 Photograph: Ryan Schuessler for the Guardian     Related: What do American Muslims think of the election and its presidential candidates?    \u201cThey\u2019ve been able to really define very significant and strong Latino and Muslim identities, and to merge the two together,\u201d said Ken Chitwood, a PhD student at the University of Florida who studies and writes about the growing Latino Muslim community. \u201cAnd they are very intentional about that.\u201d In his research, Chitwood has found that most Latino Muslims are converts from Christianity. Central and South American countries are heavily rooted in the Roman Catholic church. \u201cTypically, there is some sort of spiritual wandering that occurs,\u201d Chitwood said. \u201cThere is some type of spiritual dissatisfaction with their present religious outlook, be that Catholic or Protestant or whatever. And then they go looking.\u201d \u201cWe have it in our roots,\u201d said Navarro, who has been a Muslim for three years, one month, and 10 days as of 10 May 2016 \u2013 he\u2019s counting. \u201cIslam changed my life.\u201d The interior of Houston\u2019s Centro Isl\u00e1mico is decorated with motifs that echo the striped arches of La Mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba, a 10th-century mosque still standing in southern Spain.     \u2018You can practice Islam and remain a Latino.\u2019 Photograph: Ryan Schuessler for the Guardian     \u201cThey are doing the work of identity construction,\u201d Chitwood said. \u201cThey are imagining a common homeland for themselves, that is shared across Latino Muslims and is rooted in more traditional Islamic history. When you say \u2018the Islamic world\u2019, nobody thinks of Puerto Rico or Cuba.\u201d Fletcher said: \u201cYou can practice Islam and remain a Latino \u2026 We want Latinos to be proud of where they come from, to have a strong sense of identity for themselves.\u201d Flores had talked about Islam with Muslim co-workers, and had visited other mosques while learning more about the faith. But it was when he found the Centro Isl\u00e1mico \u2013 the community of Latino Muslims, specifically \u2013 that he was moved to profess his faith. Saturday\u2019s Cinco de Mayo celebration was only the second time he had visited the mosque. \u201cYou can relate,\u201d Flores said. \u201cA lot of Muslims grow up in their lifestyle, and we\u2019re different.\u201d \u201cWe change our religion, but we don\u2019t change our culture,\u201d said Magidel Morris, whose hijab was striped with the colors of Mexico\u2019s flag: red, white and green. \u201cWe\u2019re still Mexican.\u201d  This article was amended on 9 May 2016 to correct a previous headline, which misidentified the mosque as the first Spanish-speaking one in the US.",
