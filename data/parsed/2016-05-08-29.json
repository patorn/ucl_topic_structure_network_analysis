  "body": "Shane Meadows has said he would not rule out a new film or stage version of his This is England saga in the future.  Meadows had previously said that This is England \u201890 would be the final outing of his award-winning series, which began as a film in 2006 following young skinhead culture in the 1980s and developed into three follow-up series on Channel 4. But speaking at the Bafta TV awards, where This Is England \u201890 picked up two awards \u2013 best mini-series and best supporting actress for Chanel Cresswell \u2013 Meadows said it was \u201cdifficult to give up and close the door forever\u201d on his beloved project, adding: \u201cThis is England is more like a summer holiday than a job.\u201d Meadows said that the lives of Lol, Woody, Combo and friends could \u201cpotentially\u201d be brought to life again either on the West End stage or in another film. \u201cAll those things have crossed my mind,\u201d said Meadows. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got another series in me. This was 13 months of proper grind, I\u2019m a maniac and I have to be involved in everything. But I think there\u2019s a film that\u2019s left in there ... there is still one little gem in there.\u201d Meadows said he would even entertain the idea of doing both at the same time.  \u201cThe idea of bookending it for cinema and TV on the same night is really exciting, so maybe the two things can blossom together in one final hurrah.\u201d He joked: \u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled out OAP This is England\u201d.",
