  "body": "Blake Scott visits his barber every week without exception. He\u2019s scrupulous about tailoring and hygiene. He keenly frequents the gym. He\u2019ll hardly leave his home in downtown Los Angeles \u2013 to enjoy a chilled glass of riesling in a suite at the Ritz Carlton, say, or to charter a private jet for a deluxe weekend abroad \u2013 without dressing to catwalk-ready perfection, often in the finery of the fashion industry\u2019s most venerated designers. These are the rigors demanded by his position.  Scott is a menswear influencer: a man among the vanguard of popular tastes. The influencer is a sort of style authority \u2013 a style doyen, a style connoisseur. What he wears today, the thinking goes, you\u2019ll want to wear tomorrow.  Scott enjoys an audience of nearly half a million on Instagram, where he can daily be seen strutting down city streets in resplendent suit and tie. Scroll through his feed and you\u2019ll quickly discern the pattern: here he is buttoning his jacket and staring into the middle distance, or frozen mid-stride with an unctuous grin. But Scott is not a model. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly modelesque,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a soft chin. I\u2019m not in the best shape. Regular modeling would not be my gig.\u201d        Perhaps not. And yet people seem to quite like looking at him. Putting on a suit and getting photographed has been his full-time job for two years.  An early adopter of Instagram, in its humble pre-Facebook days, Scott emerged as one of the first men to chronicle his wardrobe in a serious way. (His fiancee has been behind the camera from the start.) \u201cThere were no guys doing what I do now,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt was very amateur, very basic. That\u2019s what I loved about it: it was just a photo and a short description. People looked to it for inspiration.\u201d  Until 2013 menswear Instagram accounts were hobbyist affairs, maintained, like small blogs, on evenings and weekends, with an enthusiast\u2019s passion. Then the brands began reaching out. \u201cThe companies want more exposure. They want the 18-24s \u2013 the audience that\u2019s actually going to buy.\u201d So they pay men like Scott to market to the consumer directly.  \u201cI showcase brands to my audience,\u201d Scott says. \u201cLike any other advertisement, I guess you could say.\u201d Though the men I talked to were reluctant, naturally, to reveal specific arrangements or fees, a new crowdsourced Tumblr aggregating influencer rates would seem to indicate payments ranging from $200 to thousands per post. Nor are the rewards just monetary: Scott finds himself routinely courted by hotel chains and travel agencies, hospitality groups and beverage manufacturers. \u201cI feel like my guy doesn\u2019t just dress up,\u201d he says, alluding to an idealized Scottian ur-follower. \u201cHe also appreciates a good whiskey or a fine resort.\u201d What\u2019s expected in return for cash and pampering is presentation \u2013 and in that Scott is beholden to the whims of his benefactors. \u201cBrands want certain things. Landscape versus horizontal, closeups versus details, clean aesthetic versus dark appeal. Everything is decided.\u201d  With all that control it\u2019s rather easy, Scott observes, to sell out. But influencers have standards, he says. And advertising can still have integrity. \u201cI\u2019m turning things down all the time,\u201d Scott insists. \u201cYou see some guys partnering with brands they\u2019d never normally wear. They\u2019re doing it only for the paycheck. I don\u2019t want to be that guy.\u201d        \u201cThe point is not to seem like a salesperson,\u201d says Jamal Jackson, who runs a menswear account on Instagram under the sobriquet the Style Society Guy. He feels the challenge of the contemporary influencer is to promote the product without making the effort conspicuous. \u201cIt has to be well-strategized,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too salesy. You need to sell a story, and it has to be organic and true. That\u2019s why brands are giving influencers more of an experience now: sending them to festivals or sending them on trips. Because guess what? Everyone\u2019s tired of hearing that your jeans fit great and that you can wear them day or night. That\u2019s old. People want a story behind everything.\u201d  Jackson has less than 10% of Scott\u2019s present following, and his Instagram feed is commensurately modest. In lieu of Scott\u2019s extravagant jet-setting, Jackson roams his native New York, where he\u2019s most often pictured trotting around Bushwick, Brooklyn, or enjoying a social brunch. Still, you can feel the throb of glamour in the portraiture, the pulse of chic experience.  But how does anyone find the time, you feel while thumbing through Jackson\u2019s pictures, to maintain such an outsized lifestyle?  \u201cYou\u2019d think in New York that people are always out getting brunch or doing happy hour or whatever, but most people go to work and then go home,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cI always told myself that I would never do that. I want to have as much fun as possible and live my life.\u201d Of course, anybody\u2019s life could be exciting if they weren\u2019t obliged to do anything but exciting things. Unfortunately for most of us more banal responsibilities interfere. But Jackson isn\u2019t dressing up and taking a quick selfie over brunch before he heads to work; dressing up and taking selfies over brunch is work.  Jackson describes himself as very busy, and I believe it \u2013 busy setting up meetings with menswear brands, arranging on-the-street photo shoots (itself a 20-hour weekly commitment, arranged with the help of camera-owning friend), and planning, every afternoon and every night, to be wherever the fashionable will be. And he can hardly afford to look shabby when it\u2019s literally his job to look good.  Imagine the upkeep. Imagine the pressure.        \u201cProbably a few years ago I wouldn\u2019t have gotten my hair cut every week or tailor every piece of clothing I own,\u201d explains Perkens Bien Aime, an influencer based in Los Angeles. \u201cBut as my popularity grows I gain more and more followers and with that comes more and more respect. I need to hold myself accountable to that.\u201d If he doesn\u2019t, he says, somebody else no doubt will. \u201cLooking good is an important part of my brand. It\u2019s what I sell to people.\u201d   \u201cI get manicures way more,\u201d Jackson admits. \u201cAttention to detail is key. Can I hold a product up in the air and look good? I\u2019m a guy, but still. The photo has to look appealing. And whatever you have to do to make it appealing is what you have to do.\u201d  \u201cTaking care of yourself shows,\u201d Bien Aime agrees. And it matters, he insists, to the people who make the whole charade possible: the fans.  \u201cThe followers look at you as a role model. You\u2019re a better version of them or an example of a way they can be,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s our job as influencers to make sure we look the part.\u201d",
