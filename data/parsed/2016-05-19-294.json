  "body": "For the past 12 years, the church of St Frances Xavier Cabrini in Scituate, near Boston, has not been empty for a single moment. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, a group of parishioners has maintained a vigil inside the building to prevent its sale by the archdiocese of Boston, to help pay the Catholic church\u2019s enormous bills relating to its long history of child sexual abuse. Children have slept in the sacristy, meals have been eaten beneath the stained glass windows, planning meetings have been held in the pews, prayers said and candles lit. But not for much longer. After the supreme court this week declined to hear an appeal against an earlier court ruling, the parishioners must now vacate the premises, and will hold a final farewell service on 29 May.

But, far from being exhausted and defeated, the core group of about 100 parishioners who have occupied the church since 2004 are gearing up to start afresh. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay together, reach out and re-energise thousands of disenfranchised Catholics who no longer trust the church,\u201d Jon Rogers, the group\u2019s spokesman, told the Guardian. They were \u201cincredibly disappointed\u201d at the supreme court\u2019s decision, he said. \u201cWe thought the higher up the legal ladder we travelled, the closer to the truth we\u2019d get. But it seems like the judicial system still has a healthy fear of the Catholic church.\u201d Possession of St Frances Xavier Cabrini, which sits in 30 acres of prime real estate overlooking the ocean about 25 miles south of Boston, will return to the archdiocese, which had sought to evict the parishioners as trespassers. In 2004, the church was put on a list of about 70 Catholic properties in and around Boston to be sold to help foot the bill to compensate the survivors of widespread sexual abuse by clergy. A year earlier, the archdiocese had agreed to pay $85m to settle almost 550 lawsuits. According to the archdiocese, St Frances Xavier Cabrini was placed on the closings list in response to declining attendance, fewer priests and changing demographics. It denied that the closure was connected to the sexual abuse crisis, saying legal settlement costs were largely met from insurance payments and the sale of an administration complex. The scale of church sexual abuse \u2013 and its cover-up \u2013 was coming to light thanks to a long investigation by the Boston Globe, recently dramatised in the Oscar-winning film Spotlight. Last year, the paper reported that at least 571 clergy within the archdiocese had been publicly accused of sexually abusing children. The scandal shook confidence in the church, and exposed how powerful it had become within the Boston establishment. Following the revelations, the proportion of Catholics regularly attending mass fell and donations to the church dwindled. \u201cThe archdiocese wanted to sell off churches to replenish its coffers which were being depleted by the sex abuse crisis,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cOur church was one of the most valuable. It really was a land grab.\u201d But before archdiocese officials could lock worshipers out of St Frances Xavier Cabrini, one parishioner slipped inside and began an occupation that by this Wednesday, had clocked up 4,222 days. \u201cWe got organised to meet the challenge,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cWe were prepared to jump through hoops of fire. We did our research, we ran processes and we shared with others how to do it. We went up against the archdiocese of Boston.\u201d Occupations also began at around 10 other churches on the archdiocese\u2019s sell-off list. One by one, protesters lost heart or legal cases, or both. But about 100 people who formed the core of The Friends of St Frances Xavier Cabrini kept going \u2013 raising funds, sewing quilts, holding services and fighting court battles. Legal arguments over the fate of the church were heard in US courts and at the Vatican\u2019s supreme court. On Monday, the end of the road came when the US supreme court refused to hear an appeal by the parishioners against an earlier ruling that the archdiocese was the legal owner of the church and had the right to evict the occupiers. In a statement, archdiocese spokesman Terrence Donilon said: \u201cGiven the denial of the Friends of St Frances Cabrini\u2019s petition, we ask them to end their vigil and leave the property within 14 days.\u201d He added that the archdiocese invited \u201cthose involved with the vigil to participate and join in the fullness of parish life\u201d. That does not seem likely. \u201cThis church is being stolen from us, there\u2019s no denying that. The archdiocese sees the value of property over the value of people,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cWhen we started this, we made two promises. The first was to exhaust every level of appeal available. We\u2019ve fulfilled that. The second promise was that this community, that came together to fight to protect our spiritual home, would go on, with or without the archdiocese of Boston.\u201d The final service in 10 days\u2019 time would be bittersweet, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of a long and arduous battle, but also the start of something new. This is what God wants us to do.\u201d",
