  "body": "The radio broadcaster Ray Hadley has roasted Scott Morrison over the government\u2019s new lifetime cap on tax concessions on superannuation contributions, warning it may be the \u201crock on which [the government] will perish\u201d. Under changes in the 2016 budget, people will not get tax concessions on superannuation they voluntarily contribute above a lifetime cap of $500,000.    Related: Liberals split over Labor plan to change rules allowing MPs to 'double dip'    The changes have come under fire from the right-wing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, which claims they are retrospective and has promised to campaign fiercely against them. The proposed changes have been criticised by Labor and the Liberal Democrats, who hope to win votes off the Coalition over the issue. Hadley warned if the government persisted with the cap Morrison would still be the member for the Sutherland shire but would not be the treasurer. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying to you at your own peril as a government unless you do something between now and July 2 on [this cap] ... this could be the rock on which you perish,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you moved the $500,000 to a million, you\u2019d probably sway the hearts and minds of people who want to see you returned to power. They don\u2019t want to deal with Bill Shorten, Chris Bowen or Tanya Plibersek but you\u2019re almost forcing their hand.\u201d  Morrison defended the cap by saying it only applied to 42,000 people out of a total of 16m with superannuation and the $500,000 limit was indexed to average wage rises. He said the median after-tax contribution over the past seven years was just $41,000. \u201cWe are talking about a very small group of people, in a position to put in hundreds of thousands of dollars of after-tax contributions,\u201d he said. Hadley said aspirational Australians \u201cfeel as if they\u2019re trapped\u201d because they don\u2019t want to vote for Labor. Morrison said: \u201cI don\u2019t suggest they should.\u201d Morrison said the cap also helped pay for the low-income superannuation tax offset, which benefits 3.3m people on low incomes. \u201cThis is about making sure our superannuation contributions are fair,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that very small number, 42,000, who have already made that $500,000, the suggestion is somehow they should be able to put another $500,000 in on top of that. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s very fair to the people out there saving today, younger people \u2013 they\u2019re not getting the access to the enormously generous contribution arrangements for many years.\u201d   Related: Malcolm Turnbull's poll rating slumps as Labor maintains 51-49 lead    Hadley said the chances younger voters would vote for the Coalition were \u201cnone and Buckley\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019ll go Labor party or Greens \u2013 I\u2019m talking about the people that vote your way. \u201cYou won\u2019t win the young voters by this, I can tell you.\u201d Morrison laughed off a series of polls showing Labor ahead 51%-49% in two-party preferred terms, saying \u201cin the UK Ed Miliband was supposed to be the prime minister\u201d. \u201cFederal election are always tightly contested and things do get closer as you go into the campaign.\u201d Hadley warned he\u2019d be \u201cfilthy\u201d with the government if Labor won and he had to interview Chris Bowen as treasurer.  Morrison speculated that Adam Bandt could be the deputy treasurer in a Labor-Greens government and Sarah Hanson-Young could be immigration minister.",
