But few have been heckled by a 12-year-old, questioned about their Canadian birth, or had their spouse field questions about their resemblance to a serial killer. All in one day. Ted Cruz suffered all this and more on Monday in Indiana, a state where he desperately needs to do well if he wants to preserve any hope of winning the Republican nomination for president. Simple arithmetic eliminated Cruz from an outright victory two weeks ago, but he has clung to the possibility that he could deny Donald Trump the 1,237 delegates a candidate needs to win the primary election. Indiana and California are the two largest states that could tilt the race in favor of a contested convention, in which Cruz would have a chance of beating Trump. But Cruz, called \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d by one of his former colleagues in Congress last week, found little more love in Indiana than in Washington. The trouble started with a 12-year-old in La Porte, Indiana. At a rally there, a boy shouted \u201cYou suck!\u201d and \u201cShut up!\u201d during Cruz\u2019s stump speech, thwarting the senator\u2019s attempts to turn the pubescent heckler into a talking point. \u201cYou know, one of the things that hopefully someone has told you is that children should speak with respect,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cImagine what a different world it would be if someone had told Donald Trump that, years ago.\u201d Eventually he gave up, saying: \u201cIn my household, when a child behaves that way they get a spanking.\u201d Police escorted the boy away, shouts of \u201cshut up\u201d continuing.  Later, Cruz was confronted near his campaign bus by supporters of his rival, who gleefully shouted \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted!\u201d at the senator from a few feet away, using Trump\u2019s preferred nickname for Cruz. Trump has bestowed pet names on each of his rivals \u2013 \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d Clinton and \u201cComrade\u201d Bernie Sanders, for instance \u2013 and has reminded his fans repeatedly that Ted Cruz was recently a dual Canadian American citizen. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out tomorrow,\u201d the Trump supporter said. \u201cIndiana don\u2019t want you.\u201d The Princeton alumnus and champion debater tried to engage. \u201cThe question everyone here should ask ... \u201d \u201cAre you Canadian?\u201d the voter asked, to titters from the crowd. Then: \u201cWhere\u2019s your Goldman Sachs jacket?\u201d an allusion to the employer of Cruz\u2019s wife. Always a lawyer \u2013 and one who has argued successfully before the supreme court \u2013 Cruz tried a different tack: an appeal to civility. \u201cIf I were Donald Trump, I wouldn\u2019t have come over to talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cSir, America is a better country ... \u201d \u201cWithout you!\u201d \u201cThank you for those kind sentiments,\u201d he said. \u201cI respect your right to speak but I\u2019m also going to say in America we are a nation that is better than anger and insults and cursing and rage. And I believe the people in Indiana have common sense and good judgement and want real solu \u2013 \u201d \u201cWoo! Vote Trump! Woo!\u201d the voter screamed, followed by others in the crowd. Cruz spun on his heels and walked away.   Related: Ted Cruz is the Zodiac killer: the anatomy of a meme gone rogue    Cruz\u2019s allies did not have much a better day. His wife, Heidi, was asked by Yahoo News to comment on a string of jokes at this weekend\u2019s White House correspondents dinner, made at her husband\u2019s expense. On Saturday, the comedian Larry Wilmore invoked an internet meme that pretends the senator is the Zodiac Killer, the enigmatic and never-captured murderer who puzzled authorities with coded notes and claimed to have killed several people in the late 1960s and early 70s. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been married to him for 15 years and I know pretty well who he is, so it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. There\u2019s a lot of garbage out there,\u201d Heidi Cruz said. Elsewhere, Cruz\u2019s would-be running mate, Carly Fiorina, slipped off a stage at a rally as Cruz obliviously continued to shake supporters\u2019 hands.            Carly Fiorina falls off stage during Ted Cruz event    Trump later commented: \u201cCruz didn\u2019t do anything; even I would have helped her ... That was a weird deal.\u201d There was no report of any injury, but internet comedians quickly seized on her literal pratfall, as well as a strange, fumbling hand clasp she attempted with Cruz. Nor could the Cruz campaign find any comfort in the polls. Averages show Cruz tanking: down 14 points to Trump, while John Kasich hovers around 11%, without enough support to make up for Cruz\u2019s deficit even if all of Kasich\u2019s voters suddenly defected to the Texan.  Trump needs about 45% of the remaining delegates in order to reach 1,237, CBS estimates \u2013 a viable possibility, considering his good chances in California, the state with the most delegates. But Cruz insisted that even without Indiana, he \u201cabsolutely\u201d had a path to the nomination, defying the cries of Trump supporters to \u201cdo the math\u201d. Nor do Americans in general seem to be taking a liking to Cruz, even though a recent Washington Post-ABC poll shows that 67% of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Trump.  Fifty-three per cent of Americans dislike Cruz. A March poll found that 52% of Americans have unfavorable opinions of Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.
