Which is why a trend is emerging of clubs and movie studios teaming up to help hawk each others\u2019 wares \u2013 led, naturally, by Manchester United. Here are four of the best efforts from Hollywood FC. Manchester United and X-Men: Apocalypse      A trailer for X-Men: Apocalypse starring Wayne Rooney. Photograph: @ManUtd/Twitter    Last Tuesday, Manchester United emerged for their season-ending tie against Bournemouth accompanied by four young mutants. Their mascots had been made up as mini characters from X-Men: Apocalypse as part of a promotional deal with 20th Century Fox, the latest impressively tenuous marketing tie-up from the Old Trafford commercial machine (see also Donaco: \u201cOfficial casino resort partner of Manchester United for Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and South Korea\u201d). At least the kids didn\u2019t pay (as mascots at some other clubs have to) for the privilege of advertising on behalf of one entertainment corporation for the commercial gain of a Cayman Islands-registered PLC. Instead, they were selected to do it by insurance multinational Aon \u2026  The promo continued on Friday, with a video of the X-Men cast watching the stars of England\u2019s fifth-best team, and deciding that the most suitable candidate to join the superpowered mutants in their mission to fight Doctor Robotnik or whatever was Wayne Rooney. As Wazza says in his latest acting tour de force, \u201cbloody hell\u201d. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Big Fish, Closer and Spider-Man 2 (among others)      Fernando Torres in a Hellboy-branded shirt in 2004. Photograph: Jose Jordan/AFP/Getty Images    The last time Atl\u00e9tico Madrid stepped on the pitch for a Champions League final (they do so again next Saturday against city rivals Real), the chests of Diego Costa and pals were emblazoned with the slogan \u201cAzerbaijan: Land of Fire\u201d. Which \u2013 unless you happen to be gay, or keen on human rights \u2013 is certainly evocative. But being sponsored by an entire country isn\u2019t the weirdest thing Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s players have had on their shirts. In 2006, an innovative deal with Columbia Pictures saw Los Rojiblancos wear the names of different upcoming movies over the course of two seasons, including Hellboy, Big Fish and Resident Evil: Apocalypse (no relation to X-Men\u2019s Apocalypse). Incidentally, all three of those films\u2019 titles correspond with nicknames given to Costa since he joined Chelsea in 2014. Manchester City and Jack Reacher     Robert Duvall, author Lee Child and Tom Cruise at the Etihad Stadium in 2012. Photograph: Shirlaine Forrest/Getty Images    As part of a day of pleasant corporate symbiosis in December 2012, Jack Reacher stars Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall spent the preamble to the Manchester derby on the pitch at the Etihad Stadium and facing hardball questions from Geoff Shreeves in the tunnel (\u201cJack Reacher, when is that released? It\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019ve seen it \u2026 Boxing Day, it\u2019s out on Boxing Day\u201d).             As Duvall explained his love of legendary Celtic winger Jimmy Johnstone, the Cruiser suggested that \u2013 despite not having seen a game in England \u2013 he had been following the sport since the 80s. We can, then, only assume he had chosen this fixture to pay his respects to the spirits of 80s City legends such as Imre Varadi and Paul Power \u2013 and not because it was in his contract. Everton and Creed     Sylvester Stallone brandishes his Everton scarf in 2007. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images    If any Hollywood character summed up Everton\u2019s 2015/16 season, it probably wouldn\u2019t be the never-say-die, grit-over-glamour spirit of Rocky Balboa. The way they defended at times was more Rocky and Bullwinkle (\u201cJohn Stones stars as Bullwinkle J Moose!\u201d). In fact, their fans\u2019 highlight of their season was probably playing a cameo role in this year\u2019s Creed. Toffees fan Stallone (who fell in love with the team after watching them draw 1-1 with Reading in 2007) filmed the crowd during an early 2015 0-0 draw with West Brom for the movie\u2019s final scene \u2013 a fight between Michael B Jordan\u2019s Adonis Creed and real-life Scouse boxer Tony Bellew. Everton fans wouldn\u2019t be this animated again until a plane with a banner calling for manager Roberto Martinez\u2019s sacking flew over Goodison Park in April.",
