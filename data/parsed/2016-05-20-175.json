As part of mental health awareness week we asked those who live with anxiety to tell us how it feels to them and to explain what people can say and do to make their condition more bearable, not worse.  Paul Culshaw, 32, Liverpool: \u2018Don\u2019t say: \u201cOh I get that. You\u2019ll be fine in a minute\u201d\u2019      Anxiety for me manifests in a pressure that I feel in the left side of my chest. All of a sudden I won\u2019t be able to breathe and my mind tells me that I could be about to have a heart attack. I know by now, eight years on, not to believe it, but it tries to communicate that frightening message all the same. When I get like this I find sitting still very difficult and social situations overwhelming. At its most intense, anxiety can make me feel like I want to jump out of the window to escape \u2013 but I don\u2019t even know what I am trying to escape from.  The worst things to hear when I feel like this are statements such as: \u201cSnap out of it,\u201d or \u201cThink positive,\u201d or: \u201cOh yeah, I get that. You\u2019ll be fine in a minute.\u201d If you don\u2019t know what to say, sometimes it\u2019s better to say nothing or keep comments minimal. When friends say: \u201cIt\u2019s all in your head,\u201d or tell me to snap out of it, it\u2019s horrible. Do people really think those with anxiety haven\u2019t considered this? It\u2019s when people say it\u2019s all in your head that really gets me. Yes, I\u2019m sure doctors would agree, it is a mental illness after all, but despite this it still affects us physically, creating sensations such as shallow breathing, hyperventilating, tightness of chest and claustrophobia. Elizabeth Yarlott, 24, London: \u2018Probably the worst thing to say is \u201cstop worrying\u201d\u2019      Anxiety has changed every aspect of my existence, and is not to be sniffed at. Probably the worst thing to say is: \u201cStop worrying.\u201d My physical symptoms come on with no warning whatsoever, and are not always linked to thoughts, events or circumstances. It can be very depressing to have a life-changing condition dismissed as something so banal as worrying. The things I wish I had been told earlier are the physiological explanations for the symptoms I had been experiencing. Before I was diagnosed with severe generalised anxiety disorder, I thought I had a brain tumour, labyrinthitis \u2013 a whole host of illnesses that I felt were the only way to explain the extremely physical feeling of anxiety. As soon as they were explained to me in an intelligent way, they became infinitely less frightening. Salma Begum, 18, Cambridge: \u2018It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t think positively. It\u2019s just that anxiety overrides it\u2019 Let me dispel some myths. Firstly, some assume anxiety is not much of a big deal and can be avoided or just switched off. There is also a general belief that anxiety only happens to people who have had a traumatic life events. Thinking there\u2019s nothing they can do to help someone with anxiety or that it\u2019s best to leave them alone when that person has isolated themselves. The worst thing to say to someone with anxiety is to calm down or that their thoughts are irrational, telling them to think positively and not to be silly. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t think positively. It\u2019s just that anxiety overrides it. The best way to handle the situation is to reassure the person that you are there for them, ask them how they are and talk about the problems. Jake Freedman, 26, London: \u2018Giving someone who experiences anxiety advice is often irritating\u2019      Anxiety for me is closely linked with the experiences of depersonalisation and derealisation, which make me feel detached from my own self and body and as though I am permanently half asleep. It seems to take my mind longer now to process information and I find it difficult to concentrate. Tingling in my hands and feet is common. Giving someone who experiences anxiety advice is often irritating, as the chances are they have tried most things that have been suggested to them. The best thing someone can say is that they are sorry I am experiencing anxiety and that I am free to talk about it if I want to. Colin MacAllister, 52, Belfast: \u2018Don\u2019t say: \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous\u201d\u2019      Anxiety is like being stretched on a medieval rack with surges of panic being randomly poured on you like buckets of ice-cold water. Or just the simple act of sitting down for a meal with friends. I can feel myself being tortured by thoughts whizzing dangerously close to my head: what if you die? What if you have a heart attack? What if you are sick? What if you can\u2019t make it to the toilet and have an \u201caccident\u201d?  The worst thing to say to someone with anxiety is: \u201cWhat are you worrying about? You\u2019re being ridiculous. You need to get over it.\u201d The best thing is: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you are feeling this, but what can I do for you?\u201d  Tiffany Stoneman, 23, Peak District: \u2018The biggest myth is that it\u2019s all in your head\u2019      My whole body responds to anxiety \u2013 I break into a sweat, my limbs go tingly (sometimes my whole mouth too). I feel sick, I get a throbbing in my ears and I have the unshakable feeling that something really, truly horrific is about to happen. It\u2019s entirely overwhelming. The biggest myth is that it\u2019s all in your head. Well, it is, but it means so much more than that. My anxiety manifests in such a physical way that it stopped me going to work, way before I realised that it was mainly psychological. The mind controls the body and vice versa. The worst things you can say are: \u201cCan\u2019t you just cheer up?\u201d Or: \u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d Or: \u201cIt\u2019s just in your head. You\u2019re actually fine.\u201d My boyfriend used to say all of the above, until he started reading about how to deal with someone with anxiety. He then learned very quickly that most often I just need a hug, or a cup of tea. Anonymous, 28, London: \u2018People with anxiety need time and patience\u2019 For me, anxiety is the feeling that there\u2019s a voice in my head that is bigger than me. When it\u2019s at its most powerful it washes over me and dilutes my personality until I don\u2019t recognise the person that\u2019s left. I feel afraid of everything.  The biggest misconception is that anxiety will just go away. For many people who suffer from it it\u2019s something that you have to live with your entire life, and learning how to cope is vital.  Whenever my anxiety has got so bad that I need medication it can sometimes be frustrating when my friends and family want me to get back to myself quickly. People with anxiety sometimes need time and patience, and that\u2019s hard for those who have never experienced it to understand \u2013 especially as sometimes there are no physical symptoms. Anxiety isn\u2019t something that just disappears overnight and sometimes although people may appear fine and \u201cback to normal\u201d they still feel fragile. Anxiety can come back at any time, sometimes without warning and for no obvious reasons.",
