Gavin Patterson, the BT chief executive, didn\u2019t actually use those words, but that was the message that came out of Thursday\u2019s financial results.  He is going to have to fork out \u00a36bn to improve the country\u2019s phone and internet infrastructure \u2013 if only to keep the regulator Ofcom off his back \u2013 but that\u2019s the price of keeping the cash cow that the wholesale division has become.    Related: BT to spend \u00a36bn on superfast broadband and 4G rollout    In 2012, Patterson shocked media observers when he agreed to pay \u00a3738m to show live Premier League matches to his broadband customers. BT Sport was initially given away for free, and for the first time, BT customers had a reason not to move their phone and internet service over to Sky.  Since then Patterson has hoovered up further Premier league games and, in what looks like a masterstroke, exclusive rights to Champions League and Europa League football ties.  Anecdotal reports suggest armchair fans are starting to wonder whether they need to pay Sky \u00a340-\u00a350 a month, when they can get plenty of live sports from BT at a fraction of the price.  BT has 1.5 million TV customers, up 28% since the start of this year. Patterson, a Liverpool fan, was keen to point out at the results briefing that the Europa League game between Liverpool and Manchester United attracted more than 2 million viewers \u2013 a BT Sport record. There was a nod to the fact that Openeach\u2019s customer service hasn\u2019t been good enough (borne out by endless letters of complaint to this newspaper). He admitted 5% of Openreach engineer home visits were cancelled without warning \u2013 a proportion he has pledged to reduce to a (still considerable) 2.5%. Surprisingly, Ofcom customer service targets in this area had been hit, he said. Criticism that BT phone and broadband customers have been paying for the sports rights \u2013 whether they like sport or not \u2013 through a series of inflation-beating price increases were similarly batted away.  Last week the company said it would raise the cost of its monthly line rental and other charges in July by 5-7%. This follows a 7% increase in September 2015 and a 6.5% increase in 2014. Half the company\u2019s broadband customers are on more profitable fibre contracts.  The fact that the company has been able to quietly increase prices by 20% in two years \u2013 with barely a murmur of complaint \u2013 is testament to the fact that fast broadband is now seen as essential, rather than a luxury item, in most households.",
