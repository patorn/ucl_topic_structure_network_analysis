  "body": "When I was given this book as a birthday present, the title and cover did not interest me initially. I thought it was an odd-looking and boring book until I looked at it closely. As they say, never judge a book by its cover. However I was soon fascinated by the the main character, Itch. He is a quiet boy who likes collecting elements from the periodic table. He hardly has any friends apart from his tomboy cousin Jack and his younger sister Chloe. Itch discovers that some of the Uranium he is given is actually super radioactive rocks! The rest of the story follows Itch as he heads the mission to put the rocks back into a well while watching out for enemies who want the rocks.       I enjoyed reading about Itch going surfing with his Dad. I would like to do that someday. I disliked the part in the book when Itch goes down the well which is near the earths core! I also disliked the part where one of the characters gets captured.  My favourite character is Jacob, who is one of the characters that Itch meets. He does some really cool karate kicks. Overall, Itch is a great and thrilling book with an easy to read storyline that will help kids to understand elements! WARNING: Once you read it you will want to read more, like me!
