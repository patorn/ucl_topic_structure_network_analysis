Related: Robin Wright targets Congo's 'conflict minerals' violence with new campaign    In a move that would have made Claire Underwood proud, Wright told an audience at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York that she had to threaten studio bosses with going public unless they agreed to equal pay \u2013 which they did. \u201cIt was the perfect paradigm. There are very few films or TV shows where the male, the patriarch, and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards,\u201d Wright said, according to a report by the Huffington Post. \u201cI was like: \u2018I want to be paid the same as Kevin.\u2019\u201d In the hugely popular political thriller, Wright plays steely first lady Claire Underwood, the wife and co-conspirator of President Frank Underwood, played by Spacey. Wright has appeared in all 52 episodes of House of Cards and directed several. Both she and Spacey are listed as executive directors of the series\u2019 fifth season.

So I capitalised on it,\u201d Wright said on Tuesday. \u201cI was like: \u2018You\u2019d better pay me or I\u2019m going to go public.\u2019 And they did.\u201d     Claire Underwood\u2019s character was more popular than [Frank\u2019s] for a period of time. So I capitalised on it.  Robin Wright     Wright was in New York to promote her campaign to end the pillage of Congo\u2019s natural resources. According to the Huffington Post, she told the audience that her earning power had been affected by having children during her marriage to fellow actor Sean Penn. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t working full-time, I wasn\u2019t building my salary bracket. If you don\u2019t build that \u2026 with notoriety and presence, you\u2019re not in the game any more. You become a B-list actor. You\u2019re not box office material,\u201d she said.  \u201cYou don\u2019t hold the value you would have held if you had done four movies a year like Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett did during the time I was raising my kids. Now I\u2019m kind of on a comeback at 50 years old.\u201d Wright is the latest high-profile actor to speak out about the gender pay gap in Hollywood. In 2015 Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence railed against men earning more than women in the film industry. Similarly, Patricia Arquette used her 2015 Oscars acceptance speech to demand equal pay and rights for women in Hollywood.
