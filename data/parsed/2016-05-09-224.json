Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky\u2019s outrage electrified the room, and his speech was visceral and heartfelt. But no one\u2019s ever heard of Peter Kosminsky, and he was wearing quite a weird jacket, so it probably didn\u2019t set alarm bells ringing. Mark Rylance? Recognisable, yes, a household name in some households, but still a bit of a luvvie. Now it\u2019s Ian Hislop. Not exactly a movie star, but people quite like him, don\u2019t they? James Nesbitt? Eek, he\u2019s in adverts. Tom Hiddleston is definitely too charming to have as an enemy. And Craig Revel Horwood? Craig Revel Horwood? You\u2019re doing something so exultantly and gratuitously ideological that you\u2019ve managed to draw Strictly pantomime villian and fixture of middle England\u2019s living rooms Craig Revel Horwood into politics? You\u2019ve goaded this sleeping giant, the ordinary licence fee payer\u2019s docile spirit animal, into expressing an opinion on something more controversial than Judy Murray\u2019s Viennese Waltz? The blood, you have to imagine, drained from Whittingdale\u2019s face.     \u2018When Craig Revel Horwood starts having a go at you, it\u2019s probably a sign that you\u2019ve overstepped the mark.\u2019 Photograph: Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images    It is a good rule of thumb, in politics as in life: when Craig Revel Horwood starts having a go at you, it\u2019s probably a sign that you\u2019ve overstepped the mark. Since last weekend\u2019s absurd provocation in friendly newspapers, wherein we learned that serious consideration was being given to the prospect of forcing shows like Strictly to vacate the most popular broadcasting slots so that we might all watch more toilet paper adverts, the extent and implacability of the culture secretary\u2019s hostility to culture has become clear. And the attempts to cast his enemies as a bunch of pampered luvvies who want ordinary people to keep subsidising their documentaries about the Mongolian nose-flute have become ever harder to sustain. Stewart Lee and Armando Iannucci might be written off this way, yes, but not David Attenborough and Gary Lineker. Indeed, when the Sun is describing the nation\u2019s favourite football broadcaster \u2013 who will certainly not be short of work should Match of the Day go out of business \u2013 as a \u201csniping leftwing bore\u201d and \u201cwarrior for social justice\u201d in a week where the public was mostly interested in the prospect of seeing him on TV in his pants, that newspaper and its allies sound suspiciously like they are out of touch. They haven\u2019t tried the same thing on Attenborough yet, it should be noted. They wouldn\u2019t dare.   Related: Pity David Attenborough \u2013 the BBC\u2019s Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise | Stewart Lee    Will any of this make the slightest difference? It may be too late to expect any significant changes to the content of the white paper, widely trailed as a gleeful assault on the integrity of public service broadcasting. On the other hand, if past experience is anything to go by, this government isn\u2019t shy of a U-turn; and, if Whittingdale and his advisers aren\u2019t completely deaf, they may at least detect that he would do well to keep the relish out of his voice as he announces the steps he intends to take. The pushback from celebrities like Lineker gives those cross-party opponents of the plans hope that their resistance will not be futile. Even if they have no legislative prospect of intervening, they can at least kick up a stink, confident in the knowledge that this issue matters not only to nose-flute aficionados but to Saturday night dance-off enthusiasts across the country, and that they can make it toxic enough to pose the government a problem. Watch out, John Whittingdale: Craig Revel Horwood\u2019s armies are on the march. They are not leftwing. They are not luvvies. They are your and your party\u2019s most reliable and sensible constituency. You radicalise them at your peril.",
