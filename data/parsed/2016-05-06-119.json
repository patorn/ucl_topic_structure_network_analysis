  "body": "Ellen DeGeneres is helping to bring a film adaptation of the 2007 BBC One series Jekyll to the big screen. The popular host and comedian is producing the Lionsgate project with Jeff Kleeman, through their A Very Good Production banner, reports Variety. Writers Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry, who most recently collaborated on the new Shane Black comedy, The Nice Guys, have already completed a script, while the search is still on for a director.

The show tracked Jackman\u2019s fight to keep his dark side at bay from his wife and two children, using modern technology. Penned by Steven Moffat, the series was pegged as a sequel to the Robert Louis Stevenson novella The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The characters last appeared in Charlie Higson\u2019s colonial-era update, Jekyll & Hyde, for ITV.  DeGeneres can next be heard on the big screen as the voice for the fish Dory in Finding Dory, Pixar\u2019s sequel to Finding Nemo.",
