  "body": "Politics often makes for strange bedfellows. Far-right parties in the UK and across Europe push for anything that will weaken the European Union \u2013 a goal shared by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. This week, their fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson went as far as to repeat the Kremlin line that Europe is partly to blame for Putin\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. One does not expect clear policy statements from Trump or Johnson, but Putin\u2019s reasoning is irrefutable. His goal is to weaken the institutions, including Nato and the EU, that could thwart his neo-Soviet ambitions. The Kremlin was in mourning when Scotland narrowly voted to stay in the UK. Putin sees Europe as his enemy and wants his adversaries to be divided, smaller and weaker.   Related: Grapes of wrath: fury in Crimea as Putin and Berlusconi drink 240-year-old wine    Divide and conquer isn\u2019t new, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t effective. During his 16 years in power, Putin has done a good job of picking off the weakest, most pliable members from the herd of European leaders and using them as a wedge against a united Europe. He had Silvio Berlusconi, who boasted he was Putin\u2019s personal advocate. He had Gerhard Schr\u00f6der \u2013 and in fact still has him as chairman of the Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany, which Schr\u00f6der signed into effect as German chancellor. Brexit isn\u2019t simply an item on Putin\u2019s wish list. Russia Today and Sputnik, Kremlin propaganda outlets that are inexplicably treated as legitimate news sources in the west, are full of Brexit articles (next to the pro-Trump ones). Putin always supports the most divisive elements in European politics, and hopes they will repay the favour by voting to end the EU sanctions placed on Russia after his invasion of Ukraine. Europe\u2019s anti-immigrant parties, the quasi-fascists and the not-so-quasi fascists, openly venerate the man who has annexed European territory and continues his military assault in Ukraine \u2013 a country Putin wishes to punish for following the dream of joining the EU, a dream some in Britain would freely abandon.   Related: Life after Ukraine: the \u2018invisible\u2019 Russian fighters struggling to return to normal    Brexit would embolden the forces of divisiveness and hatred already on the rise. It would be a boon to the terror groups already active inside and outside Europe\u2019s borders, to the Russian dictator who is crashing through those borders, and it would reduce the ability of the UK and Europe to resist these assaults. It would be a giant step backwards for the global order, for the globalised economic growth that depends on that order, and for the values of human rights and democracy. There are limits to broad appeals to the greater good and what Winston Churchill called \u201cthe responsibility of greatness\u201d. It is reasonable for Britons to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d Healthy self-interest is a cornerstone of democracy and the free market system that has brought freedom and prosperity to so much of the world \u2013 the freedom and prosperity we envied so much from behind the iron curtain. Yet without the UK\u2019s influence, the EU will move toward the ideologies and policies that frustrate many Britons (and others). Meanwhile, the UK would still rely on the EU, an EU made less effective and more vulnerable to exactly the tendencies the Brexiteers complain about most. To solve its problems and to become a better version of itself, the EU needs the UK \u2013 and the UK needs that better EU.    To solve its problems and to become a better version of itself, the EU needs the UK \u2013 and the UK needs that better EU    I do not have a great deal of sympathy for the Brussels bureaucracy. No one who grew up in a totalitarian state has ever looked at a problem and thought that what was needed was another layer of politicians and functionaries. In this case, however, the cure has proved to be better than the disease. For all its limitations, the EU is far superior to the fractious era that went before. A quick survey of those who most desire a return to that era is enough to give pause. If you\u2019re not sure of the best course of action, you could do worse than look at what Putin wants and do the opposite. For example, he desperately wants Trump to become the next president of the United States. The European dream is still worth fighting for, and must be fought for. Churchill, addressing the American people on 6 September 1943, pleaded the common values of Anglo-American unity. His coalition of English-speaking peoples is obsolete. The union has expanded to include all those who desire a common language of liberty, peace and democracy. But Churchill\u2019s words still apply: \u201cI say, \u2018You cannot stop.\u2019 There is no halting-place at this point. We have now reached a stage in the journey where there can be no pause. We must go on. It must be world anarchy or world order.\u201d  This piece is also published on InFacts.org",
