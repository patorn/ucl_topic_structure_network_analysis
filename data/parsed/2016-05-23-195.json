  "body": "Eighty minutes after we walk into Gary Lockett\u2019s empty gym, at the end of a raw and moving interview, we take a breather. The boxing trainer has spoken with compassion and honesty while moving from his bruising years as a professional fighter who was good enough to headline a world title contest in Atlantic City to the darkest night of his life. Two months ago this week Lockett was in Nick Blackwell\u2019s corner when, after a bout against Chris Eubank Jr, his fighter ended up in an induced coma for nine days. At least the story has a happy ending for, even if Blackwell will never box again, he has recovered and remains close friends with his trainer.   Related: Nick Blackwell: Eubanks were \u2018inhuman and disgusting\u2019 for going public    Lockett looks drained as the sound system in the fitness centre outside echoes around us. It is an ordinary morning in Cardiff and the world keeps turning. But in the hushed sanctuary of his gym, in this private space, tears have been shed and memories turned inside out. We have reached a place where he can smile again. The 39-year-old Welshman nods and leans forward when asked if he can imagine himself working in boxing years from now. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in boxing 30 years and, even with kids who\u2019ve never boxed, you see the difference it makes. It\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful sport. I\u2019m currently working with expelled children and the two big things you want is for them to avoid prison and become more employable. You need to improve their attitude, get them to think for themselves, become more disciplined and take some qualifications. You can make a positive difference through boxing.\u201d Lockett pauses before, sinking back into his chair, he speaks clearly. \u201cI can honestly say that if I won the lottery on Saturday I will still be working with my fighters on Monday. I think so much of them. It\u2019s not a job \u2013 it\u2019s a hobby I love. But, after everything that happened with Nick, it took me three weeks to come back. The first day I nearly stopped myself three or four times. But everyone at the gym has been brilliant. The man downstairs at reception gave me a bear hug.\u201d Lockett mimics his embarrassment at that man-clinch. \u201cI was like: \u2018Yeah. OK. You all right?\u2019 The guy said: \u2018It\u2019s so empty without you boxing fellers. You\u2019re all such characters.\u2019\u201d     A swelling grew over Nick Blackwell\u2019s eye during his bout with Chris Eubank Jr. Photograph: TGSPhoto/REX/Shutterstock    The best boxing men are not just characters. They are people who, dealing with hurt every day, can express fear and vulnerability in stark yet vivid language. Lockett, typically, talks with fierce, flowing eloquence. \u201cIt\u2019s still very raw, it\u2019s still very painful,\u201d he says of the near tragic night when Blackwell faced Eubank Jr. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the fight back and I\u2019ll never watch it as long as I live. Luckily it turned out OK in the end but, obviously, it will never leave me.\u201d Lockett starts to cry. But he is such a strong and proud man that he keeps talking even as he instinctively brings his hands to his face to wipe away the tears. He rightly feels no shame in showing his emotions because that grave night marked him. \u201cFighters always say: \u2018Oh, I know the risks\u2019, but you don\u2019t expect the risks to be bestowed on you. To see Nick on a life-support machine will haunt me the rest of my life. To see a happy-go-lucky, lovely, lovely boy, who I have a special relationship with, on a life-support machine \u2026\u201d The trainer shudders, and then continues. \u201cBut you can\u2019t stop a fight at the first sign of trouble. I know Nick better than most people. He\u2019s as hard as nails and always comes back. I know he was losing by a long way but I\u2019m trying to think of ways to help him change the flow. \u201cI spoke to [the referee] Victor Loughlin the following Wednesday. Vic is possibly the best ref in the country. If there was a time to stop it earlier Vic would have seen that. Vic refereed Blackwell when he was behind after the first five against Damon Jones and then knocked him out. Vic knew this kid starts slow and then, boom, he fires. It was very hard for Victor. He was in turmoil over whether to referee the next weekend. I said: \u2018If you refereed one of my boys I would not have 1% less confidence in you than I did last week.\u2019 Hopefully he took some positivity from that.\u201d    I\u2019ve never seen the fight back and I\u2019ll never watch it as long as I live    Blackwell himself has since been interviewed by The Sun and on ITV by Piers Morgan. In Monday\u2019s newspaper interview Blackwell is quoted as saying that if he throws one more punch in his life he would like it to land on the jaw of Chris Eubank. Blackwell told Morgan that \u2018I can\u2019t actually remember saying that.\u2019 He also said \u2018No\u2019 when asked by Morgan if he would like to punch Eubank. But he dismissed the argument that Eubank Sr had acted compassionately by telling his son to aim for Blackwell\u2019s body rather than his head towards the end of the fight. \u201cAs anyone in boxing knows, it\u2019s more of a tactical thing,\u201d Blackwell said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t stop me to the head, so he went to the body to try and get rid of me.\u201d Considering his own role, and preferring not to discuss the Eubanks, Lockett talks powerfully. \u201cIf there was any sign of anything in the corner I would have stopped it straightaway. Remember how I got criticised for pulling Ricky Owen out of Prizefighter? He\u2019d won two fights and was in the final against Willie Casey, a strong man. Rick was cut over his eye, and knackered, so I pulled him out. \u201cIt cost him \u00a38,000 but when it comes to protecting someone, money is irrelevant. If it had cost him \u00a3150,000 I would have still pulled him out. I pulled out Kerry Hope against Darren Barker. Gavin Rees had two good rounds against Adrien Broner before he was dropped. As soon as I threw in the towel I got criticised: \u2018Lockett is too close to his fighters.\u2019\u201d Lockett had an impressive 30-2 record as a professional and in his final bout in 2008, he lost his world title challenge against Kelly Pavlik \u2013 then considered the hottest fighter in the US. Steeped in boxing, Lockett was convinced Blackwell could beat Eubank. He had watched from the corner when, after a fitful start, Blackwell found the spark to stop John Ryder and win the British middleweight title last June. He did the same two months later when stopping Jones. \u201cWe were very confident because, in the right mood, Nick is relentless. Eubank likes to produce these 20-punch flurries. But then he needs a big breather. The plan was to pressure Chris and not give him respite. But Nick never switched on. He was jabbing and that\u2019s about it. Nick just couldn\u2019t execute the game plan.\u201d A dominant Eubank snapped Blackwell\u2019s head back repeatedly with hurtful uppercuts. A grotesque swelling formed above Blackwell\u2019s left eye. \u201cI kept thinking Nick\u2019s going to switch on but we got to round seven and he lost it big,\u201d Lockett recalls. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t landed a punch and Eubank was teeing off. I told Nick he had to fight back and asked: \u2018What\u2019s his power like?\u2019 Nick said: \u2018He can\u2019t hurt me. He\u2019s not got much power \u2013 he\u2019s just snappy. But when he lets them go he\u2019s relentless and I\u2019m finding it hard to tuck up and come back with my shots.\u2019 \u201cAfter that Chris wasn\u2019t the same. He\u2019d used a lot of energy. I still had Nick losing every round but some people said he pinched one or two. I said: \u2018You\u2019re way behind but he looks knackered, this kid. If you jump on him now, pour out all your emotions and every bit of hard work. Throw as many punches as you can.\u2019 I felt, with Eubank tiring, if Nick came on strong who knew what might happen. It was never a case of sending a beaten fighter out to take more punishment.\u201d Eubank stopped him in the 10th round when the referee asked the doctor to examine Blackwell\u2019s swollen eye. After much deliberation the doctor ended the fight. Blackwell smiled sadly as he congratulated his opponent and listened to consoling words from Eubank Sr. But when did Lockett realise something was terribly wrong?   Related: Nick Blackwell\u2019s plight again underlines the risks boxers take | Kevin Mitchell    \u201cWhen Nick collapsed in my arms. I\u2019d said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it. You weren\u2019t yourself tonight. Just have a good rest.\u2019 He said his head was starting to hurt. Then he started to slip. I got my right hand under his left armpit and called for the stool. I thought it was exhaustion but he slumped to the ground and they put the oxygen mask on his face. They did a wonderful job of getting him anaesthetised within 13 minutes of the fight ending.\u201d Did Lockett know the situation was critical? \u201cI knew then. It\u2019s horrific. I would have felt it if it had been any boxer. But with it being someone I\u2019m particularly close to it\u2019s horrendous.\u201d Lockett accompanied Blackwell and his family to St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington. \u201cAfter two and a half hours the doctor said: \u2018It\u2019s a bleed on the edge of the skull and we don\u2019t need to operate. That\u2019s very positive. We\u2019ve seen encouraging signs. But I won\u2019t lie to you. It is very serious.\u2019\u201d His father-in-law, a former orthopaedic surgeon, tried to reassure Lockett. \u201cIt was still the worst time of my life by some distance,\u201d the trainer says. \u201cBut imagine how much worse it was for Nick\u2019s family. They\u2019re very close.\u201d Lockett spent most of the next nine days at hospital but he was on a rare break with his own family when he spoke to Mick Hennessy, Blackwell\u2019s promoter. \u201cMick said: \u2018Nick\u2019s awake. He\u2019s talking and he\u2019s laughing.\u2019 The relief was huge. Absolutely huge. I had a pint of Guinness. And another. And a couple of glasses of wine when I got home.\u201d The impact on his family and his other fighters had been acute. \u201cMy wife is a brilliant mother and a very strong woman. But it affected her and the boys in the gym. Liam Williams [his unbeaten light-middleweight] was meant to defend his British and Commonwealth title the week after Nick. Alex Hughes and Jay Harris were on the undercard. I told them: \u2018You\u2019re not boxing.\u2019 Liam said: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want to.\u2019 He was in Nick\u2019s corner with me and not in the right frame of mind to fight. \u201cWe were supposed to go on a family holiday in the Easter break. I cancelled that. I couldn\u2019t go on holiday with my boxer lying in hospital in a coma. Some people said: \u2018You should go, take your mind off it.\u2019 I said: \u2018Take my mind off it? I want to be there for him. He\u2019s my fighter. He\u2019s my friend.\u201d How is Blackwell now? \u201cI saw him yesterday. He\u2019s great. He\u2019s back to normal. Absolutely. I asked him: \u2018How are you?\u2019 Nick said: \u2018Oh mate, I\u2019m fine. How are you?\u2019\u201d     Gary Lockett said of Blackwell\u2019s fight against Eubank Jr: \u2018I kept thinking Nick\u2019s going to switch on but we got to round seven and he lost it big\u2019 Photograph: Adam Holt/Reuters    Trainers are often the forgotten men in boxing and so Lockett hesitates. \u201cI\u2019m OK. I go back into the ring for the first time on 4 June. Liam is fighting. I\u2019m very strong. I\u2019m also confident I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I can honestly say I tried to act in Nick\u2019s best interests. I tried to help him win the fight. I care about him.\u201d Lockett thinks hard when asked how he might react if Williams hits trouble. Can he stay calm and clear-thinking and allow Williams to find a way out of such danger? \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see. Do I have extra concerns? Of course. I will be even more careful. Everyone says they know the risks. But, really, you\u2019re not quite in touch with the risks until this happens. It make you think much more deeply about everything.\u201d Then, like sunlight breaking through a dark bank of cloud, Lockett looks up and smiles. \u201cYou know, after a period of doubting myself, there were just too many positive messages for me to turn away. I decided to stop thinking about the negatives and start focusing on the positives. We\u2019ve got so much good work to do. We\u2019ve all got so much hope again.\u201d           Boxer Nick Blackwell criticises Eubanks for giving press conference after coma fight",
