  "body": "We rarely look directly at it but we miss it\u00a0when we can\u2019t see it. If\u00a0it wasn\u2019t there at all, we\u2019d be gone too. It delivers the food we eat, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear. We read by its light \u2013 on a screen, on paper, indoors or out \u2013 because it is the ultimate energy source: indeed, the only energy source. It powered the primeval forests of carboniferous ferns and conifers that became our fossil fuel just as it drives the winds for the electrical turbines that must one day replace coal and oil. Even the radioactive elements whose decay and fission keep the planet alive and self-renewing are stellar confections: fragments first forged in, and then recycled by supernovae, exploding giant suns. That lucky old sun, the great Louis Armstrong sang, \u201chas nothing to do but roll around heaven all day\u201d. In fact, it is the only thing in the solar system that really works hard: every second it converts 600m tonnes of hydrogen to 596m tonnes of helium and those missing 4m tonnes become the energy released by the thermonuclear reaction: a bonus of electromagnetic radiation distributed across the entire solar system. A trifling 2 billionth of this highlights one side of the spinning Earth, delivering energy at the rate of 1,361 joules per square metre. This is the caloric power a hungry human might derive from a\u00a0mere crumb, a tenth of a gram of a commercially marketed corn chip, says Lucie Green helpfully. But this planetary nourishment arrives every second to every square metre and from this shining moment all else follows: everything that has ever lived, every evolutionary advance, every human conceit, every sensory pleasure, and every book, including this one. And you can read this only because printer\u2019s ink absorbs visible light and bleached paper reflects it \u2013 both of these of the sun\u2019s making. But the light that hits the page \u2013 in this story of research in progress \u2013 seems a strangely haphazard agency. It begins in the heart of the sun, in a ball of matter 133,000 times the mass of the Earth, so\u00a0crushed by its own gravitational force that it has 10 times the density of\u00a0lead, 2.5bn times the pressure of air, and is hot enough to shred atoms: they become plasma, the fourth state of matter, a swirl of electrons and protons. (In 1993 the band They Might Be Giants recorded a cover of \u201cWhy Does the Sun Shine?\u201d, which contains the line: \u201cThe sun is a mass of incandescent gas.\u201d Sixteen years later, they wrote a companion song that updated it to \u201cThe sun is a miasma of incandescent plasma\u201d.) In this vast furnace, 15m C at its core, the highly improbable can happen: just give it time. Protons collide and, once every 100bn collisions, overcome their resistance to each other, perform a complex three-step dance of union, and become a helium-3 nucleus, releasing two neutrinos and two gamma ray photons in the process. The neutrinos instantly make the journey from the sun\u2019s core to the cosmos at the speed of\u00a0light, and every second 100bn of\u00a0these pass through matter the size of\u00a0a human fingertip as if it wasn\u2019t there. But the gamma ray photons can\u00a0barely travel a millimetre before smashing into electrons, to be scattered and bounced back, losing a tiny bit of energy in the process. This bashing and\u00a0scattering happens an estimated 10\u00a0million billion billion times as the photons find their way to the surface of\u00a0the sun: a distance of 500m km.   Related: Staring at the sun: our local star \u2013 in pictures    What begins as a laborious struggle through ultra-dense plasma becomes a\u00a0mere obstacle race through the cooler zones where atoms can survive, and the light by which you read this is finally released by yet another freak of\u00a0solar physics. A high energy photon is absorbed by a negative hydrogen ion\u00a0which bubbles nearer to the surface\u00a0at about a kilometre a second to release \u2013 at last \u2013 a photon of light in\u00a0the visible spectrum that can make a\u00a0dash to Earth\u2019s surface in around eight minutes. Negative hydrogen ions midwife 95% of the sun\u2019s visible light, and for every 100m hydrogen atoms in the sun\u2019s photosphere, there is only one negative hydrogen ion. \u201cThe sun seems to be driven by some extremely unlikely processes,\u201d Green writes. \u201cBut, of course, the sheer scale of the\u00a0sun makes these things possible.\u201d None of these happenings can be empirically tested, and very little can be observed directly: the whole story has had to be assembled by inference and conjecture, cautious observation and some serious mathematical physics, from the first sight of sunspots\u00a0to the launch of space-based solar observatories. It is a story with its\u00a0heroes and heroines: one of the latter is Annie Jump Cannon, recruited by Harvard in the 19th century as a\u00a0computer (the word originally described a person who computed) to classify stars from their spectra: she categorised 250,000 in a lifetime. Another was Cecilia Payne, first at Cambridge and then Harvard, the first\u00a0astronomer to make an accurate estimation of the sun\u2019s chemical composition, although the men around her wouldn\u2019t accept her results. Green is herself a solar physicist and\u00a0TV presenter and this book tells a\u00a0luminous story with (what other phrase could one use?) a light touch. The account embraces both the making of the solar system from a cloud of swirling gas and dust, and the sun\u2019s probable end first as a red giant, and then as a white dwarf, fading to oblivion in a slow, billion-year extinction. But the real thrill is in the incomplete unfolding story: of the puzzles set by coronal mass ejections, those great million-mile-an-hour blasts of stellar fabric that light up the aurorae, pound spacecraft and once, in 1859, set telegraph equipment ablaze. The narrative encompasses the piecemeal answers delivered periodically by eclipses, the measurements of the sun\u2019s extraordinary magnetic field, the strange resonances within the sun that triggered a new science called helioseismology, and the continuing discoveries of the marvellous Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, and now at or perhaps beyond the furthest outposts of the empire of the sun. And, in the next two years, the European Space Agency and Nasa will each launch a space mission to observe the making of the solar wind, while Voyager 1 and 2 are still feebly relaying signals from the furthest edge. \u201cFor the first time the beginning and the end of the heliosphere will be studied simultaneously,\u201d Green says. \u201cI cannot imagine that this will ever happen again.\u201d \u2022 To order 15 Million Degrees for \u00a315.19 (RRP \u00a318.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
