  "body": "The United Nations must pass a resolution for an internationally supervised vote for independence in West Papua, global parliamentarians and independence advocates have said. In a meeting in London on Tuesday, the West Papuan independence leader, Benny Wenda, will join parliamentarians, lawyers and humanitarians from the UK and the Pacific region to demand the United Nations pass a resolution for an independence referendum, in order to make up for its \u201cmistake\u201d in allowing Indonesia to take control almost 50 years ago.   Related: Indonesia warns other countries to respect its sovereignty over Papua    West Papuans are the indigenous people of a region on the Western half of an island shared with Papua New Guinea. Formerly under Dutch colonisation, Indonesia took temporary control of West Papua under a UN\u2013backed treaty in 1963. It later gained complete rule through a UN-sanctioned but discredited ballot in 1969, in which just a little over 1000 Indonesian-picked West Papuan leaders representatives cast votes under threat of violence. Wenda said that vote, so called the \u201cact of free choice\u201d, was a betrayal of West Papuans and now was the time for the United Nations to set it right. \u201cWe West Papuans call it the act of no choice,\u201d Wenda told the Guardian. \u201cThe UN already made a mistake, they broke their own rule. That\u2019s why the UN needs to correct it now.\u201d The Free West Papua movement hopes to see a UN resolution within two years to send international peacekeepers to protect West Papuans as they vote on independence. \u201cFor 50 years Indonesia massacred my people, 500,000 people. We need international peacekeeping force in West Papua,\u201d said Wenda. \u201cIn maybe another 10 or 20 or 50 years time I think my people will become a minority. We need this as soon as possible.\u201d Joining Wenda at Tuesday\u2019s announcement will be \u02bbAkilisi P\u014dhiva, the Tongan prime minister and first head of state to attend a Free West Papua meeting, Papua New Guinea governors Powes Parkop and Garry Juffa, and Vanuatu minister Ralph Regenvanu. A message of support will be read on behalf of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Regenvanu told the Guardian his nation had always supported a free West Papua, and he called on others in the region, in particular Australia and New Zealand which currently back Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty, to join them. \u201cThey need to step up and recognise what\u2019s happening on their doorstep,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI think the attitude of the governments of New Zealand and Australia is quite shameful when it comes to West Papua.\u201d Human Rights lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, noted both nations also supported Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor until \u201cthe very last moment\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s important we continue build strong civil society campaigns within Australia and New Zealand to put further pressure on the governments to do the right thing,\u201d Robinson told the Guardian. \u201cIt is of course unlawful as a matter of international law to recognise an unlawful situation, and Indonesia\u2019s occupation of West Papua is unlawful because they did not respect international law in the process by which West Papua was incorporated into the state.\u201d The referendum called for on Tuesday is modelled on that held in the former Indonesian territory of Timor Leste in 1999. While the hope is West Papua would see similar success in gaining independence, there is fear it could also see the same human rights atrocities and widespread violence by Indonesian forces. It\u2019s estimated about one third of East Timor\u2019s population was killed during Indonesian occupation and during the fighting which marred the independence vote despite the presence of peacekeepers.

Under his rule, alleged abuses and violent attacks by military and police, including mass arrests and crackdowns on peaceful protests, have continued. In the last month alone more than 60 people have been arrested, Wenda said. \u201cThis is everyday life in West Papua. Physically, mentally, Indonesia intimidates every day,\u201d said Wenda. Wenda, who famously escaped an Indonesian prison and fled to Papua New Guinea before seeking asylum in the UK, was coy about any role in a future West Papuan parliament. \u201cMy people will decide on whoever they want to lead us independence, but my obligation now is to free West Papua,\u201d he said.",
