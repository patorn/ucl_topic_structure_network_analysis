First seen in Brazil last year, the Zika virus has now been detected in more than 50 countries. Brazil remains the country most-affected by the mosquito-borne virus, which has been proven to cause a severe birth defect that results in babies born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains. The virus has also been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis and death. In February, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern. Save for advising pregnant women not to travel to Zika-affected areas \u2013 including Rio de Janeiro \u2013 WHO has not issued any other travel restrictions on Zika-affected countries. Speaking to the Guardian on Thursday, Attaran described the idea of going ahead with the games as both \u201cindescribably foolish\u201d and \u201cmonstrously unethical\u201d. The potential risks to visitors range from brain-damaged children to death in rare instances, he added. \u201cIs this what the Olympics stand for?\u201d The state of Rio de Janeiro has recorded 26,000 suspected Zika cases \u2013 the highest of any state in Brazil \u2013 and has an incident rate of 157 per 100,000, the fourth highest in the country, he said. \u201cWhat is proposed is to bring half a million Olympic visitors into the heart of the epidemic.\u201d   Related: 100 days until Rio 2016: 'It will be a great party, with a garbage legacy'    The deluge of athletes and visitors expected to pour into Rio from countries around the world could facilitate the virus\u2019s transmission in countries that to date have been unaffected, he said.  The risk is that the virus may land on the doorstep of countries that do not have adequate healthcare infrastructure to tackle the virus. \u201cWith all those skills and gifts that Brazil possesses, it has been unable to quell this catastrophe,\u201d said Attaran. \u201cAre we seriously expecting that Nigeria, the Congo, and Indonesia will be able to do so?\u201d  On Thursday, WHO responded to the claims, noting that the Zika virus usually results in mild symptoms \u2013 ranging from fever, body aches and rashes \u2013 with most of those affected not experiencing any symptoms at all. The organisation said it has been working with the Brazilian government to mitigate the risk posed by Zika to athletes and visitors, and is encouraging visitors to take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites and practice safer sex. The timing of the Games may also prove help helpful. \u201cThe Games will take place during Brazil\u2019s wintertime when there are fewer active mosquitoes and the risk of being bitten is lower,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. The International Olympic Committee said it has no plans to postpone or move the Games and instead has been in close contact with WHO to track the Zika virus in Brazil. \u201cWe are working with our partners in Rio on measures to deal with the pools of stagnant water around the Olympic venues, where the mosquitos breed, to minimise the risk of visitors coming into contact with them,\u201d the IOC told the Guardian.  In recent weeks, the Zika outbreak has been eclipsed by the many challenges facing Brazil: Dilma Rousseff, the country\u2019s president, has been stripped of her presidential duties and is facing impeachment; the economy has plunged into a deep recession; and uproar has been growing over a corruption scandal involving the state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, and politicians across the spectrum. Rousseff was suspended early on Thursday, after the country\u2019s senate voted to impeach her over charges she whitewashed government finances. Hours later the interim president, Michael Temer, named a politician with no medical background as the new health minister. The portfolio will be taken by Ricardo Barros, a civil engineer by training. He is the fourth health minister in little more than half a year. The medical director of Australia\u2019s Olympic team said he believed the risk of the Zika virus was minimal for Australian athletes. \u201cThe last couple of people that I have spoken to, who have been to Rio in the past month or two, haven\u2019t seen a mosquito,\u201d said David Hughes in a statement. \u201cGiven that there is no chance that the Games are going to be shifted to another venue, I believe we can proceed with confidence, knowing that we have appropriate guidelines and preventative measures in place.\u201d Canada\u2019s Attaran is not the first academic to publicly question whether the games in Brazil should go on as planned. In February, New York University\u2019s Arthur Caplan and Lee Igel, wrote in an article that \u201cto host the Games at a site teeming with Zika ... is, quite simply, irresponsible\u201d. Attaran pointed to the 1976 Winter Olympics \u2013 moved to Austria after mounting costs forced the American city of Denver to withdraw as host \u2013 as a precedent for allowing the Games to be changed in exceptional circumstances. \u201cI\u2019m not the Olympic Grinch. I\u2019m not calling for the games to be cancelled,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking for is a bit of delayed gratification so that babies aren\u2019t born permanently disabled.\u201d",
