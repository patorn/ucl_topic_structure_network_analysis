  "body": "Hillary Clinton, for the first time since launching her campaign, declared herself the inevitable nominee of the Democratic party on Thursday, having held off a surprisingly strong challenge from her progressive rival, Bernie Sanders.  While Clinton has maintained a comfortable lead in both delegates and votes, her opponent has refused to bow out of the primary race even as his path to the nomination narrowed. On Thursday, Clinton said her pledged delegate lead is \u201cinsurmountable\u201d and concluded that Sanders is no longer a barrier on her path to the nomination.    Related: US election delegate tracker: who's winning the presidential nomination?    \u201cI will be the nominee for my party \u2026 That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won\u2019t be,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with CNN on Thursday. The Sanders campaign dismissed Clinton\u2019s comments in a statement that suggested the nomination was still his for the taking.  \u201cIn the past three weeks voters in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton,\u201d said campaign spokesman Michael Briggs on Thursday.  \u201cWe expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree. And with almost every national and state poll showing Senator Sanders doing much, much better than Secretary Clinton against Donald Trump, it is clear that millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign.\u201d Clinton has 1,768 pledged delegates compared with Sanders\u2019 1,494 delegates, out of the 2,383 needed to win the nomination. When super-delegates \u2013 unbound delegates who are free to switch their support \u2013 are taken into account, Clinton needs just 90 more delegates to clinch the nomination. The Sanders\u2019 campaign maintains that if it can level the playing field with a win in California, where polling shows the candidates close, he can then flip enough super-delegates to wrest the nomination from Clinton. Sanders has pledged to remain in the race until the California primary on 7 June, and has previously vowed to continue his campaign through the party\u2019s convention in Philadelphia this summer. \u201cI should tell you, that there a lot of people out there \u2013 many of the pundits and politicians \u2013 they say Bernie Sanders should drop out \u2026 Well let me be as clear as I can be: I agree with you. We are in until the last ballot is cast,\u201d Sanders told a crowd in California on Tuesday. Sanders has been under fire from Democratic leaders to denounce the unrest that erupted at the Nevada convention in Las Vegas last weekend when his supporters shouted down Clinton delegates and bombarded the state party\u2019s chairwoman with threats because of a perceived bias against their candidate. The discord revealed deep fissures in the Democratic party, and raised the specter of disturbances at the Philadelphia convention in July. Clinton called what transpired at the Nevada convention \u201cdisturbing\u201d but said she was confident that the party would find a way to unite. She then called on her opponent to \u201cdo his part\u201d to unify a divided Democratic party, as she did herself in 2008 after losing a bruising primary battle to then-senator Barack Obama.  \u201cThat\u2019s why the lesson of 2008, which was a hard-fought primary, if you remember, is so pertinent here. Because I did my part, but so did Senator Obama,\u201d she said.  After campaigning for Obama, he in turn asked her to serve as his first secretary of state, a role she initially refused, the story goes, and eventually accepted. Asked whether she would consider Sanders for a running mate, Clinton replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question.\u201d During the interview, she also criticized the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, denouncing him as \u201cnot qualified\u201d for the presidency, a characterization she has avoided until now.  \u201cWhen you run for president of the United States, the entire world is listening and watching,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when you say you\u2019re going to bar all Muslims, you\u2019re sending evidence to the Muslim world, and you\u2019re also sending a message to terrorist ... Donald Trump is essentially being used as a recruiter for more people to join the cause of terrorism.\u201d Asked if Clinton feels compelled to defend her husband, former President Bill Clinton, after Trump revived a decades-old rape allegation against him, Clinton said she did not. \u201cI know that\u2019s exactly what he is fishing for,\u201d she said.
