  "body": "Hours after Senator Bernie Sanders released a statement condemning \u201cany and all forms of violence,\u201d he rallied thousands of cheering supporters in southern California \u2013 without mentioning the unrest at the Nevada Democratic convention, during which his supporters threw chairs and threatened the party chairwoman. \u201cWithin the last few days there have been a number of criticisms made against my campaign organization,\u201d the leftwing presidential candidate said in a statement earlier in the day. \u201cParty leaders in Nevada, for example, claim that the Sanders campaign has a penchant for violence. That is nonsense.\u201d As thousands of supporters at Cal State Dominguez Hills interrupted him with cheers, Sanders celebrated his win in the Oregon primary.   Related: Sanders wins Oregon primary while Clinton claims narrow win in Kentucky    Sanders opened his appearance, one of three in California this week as the 7 June primary nears, by addressing Kentucky: \u201cIn a closed primary, something I am not all that enthusiastic about, where independents are not allowed to vote, where Secretary Clinton defeated Barack Obama by 250,000 votes in 2008, it appears that we\u2019re going to end up with about half the delegates.\u201d Half an hour later, when he actually won a contest, he was even more jubilant, interrupting his usual stump speech with a victory announcement. \u201cMy wife tells me CNN has called Oregon for Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said, as the packed tennis stadium erupted. \u201cWe won a great victory in the state of Washington a few months ago. We just won Oregon. And we\u2019re going to win California. I am getting to like the west coast.\u201d Sanders may have ignored the Nevada controversy on Tuesday night, but it was top of the news away from his campus rally in the gritty Los Angeles County city of Carson. Earlier on Tuesday the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, told reporters that violent threats and harassment by Sanders supporters at Saturday\u2019s Nevada convention amounted to a \u201ctest of leadership\u201d for Sanders, and called on him and his campaign to condemn the unrest. In an interview in his Century City office, the former California governor Gray Davis said on Tuesday that \u201cyou never condone violence. You never condone threats. But I have some empathy for the passion people feel, particularly when it\u2019s your first campaign.\u201d And even when it\u2019s not. \u201cAs a Hillary Clinton supporter, when we lost to Obama in 2008,\u201d Davis said, \u201cI know how bitter people felt, particularly some women who said, \u2018I\u2019m never going to vote for Obama.\u2019 But at the end of the day, in part because Hillary came out very strong ... my guess is 85% to 90% of people who voted for Hillary [voted for Obama].\u201d For a man with virtually no chance of clinching the Democratic nomination for president, Sanders continues to draw massive audiences of cheering supporters. On Tuesday night, as the sun set, the chill crept in and controversy swirled, thousands of the faithful gathered inside the tennis stadium at Cal State Dominguez Hills. They filled the seats and spilled on to the green court. They waved signs calling for free college tuition, wore T-shirts emblazoned with the candidate\u2019s trademark horn rims and flyaway white hair, and happily took part in campaign call and response: \u201cAre you ready to fight?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cAre you ready to vote?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cAre you ready to win?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d And they cheered themselves hoarse. But even if the electorate \u2013 led by droves of new, young voters \u2013 rallies behind the septuagenarian with the Brooklyn accent and rumpled suits, he\u2019d still have to capture more than 85% of the delegates and super delegates left to overtake Clinton in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. And that, while not impossible, is one massive feat. Not that you\u2019d know it by listening to Sanders on Tuesday night. \u201cBy the way, I should tell you that there are a lot of people out there \u2026 they say that Bernie Sanders should drop out, that the people of California should not have the right to determine who the next president will be,\u201d he said. \u201cWell let me be as clear as I can be: we are in until the last ballot is cast.\u201d California alone accounts for more than half of the remaining delegates. Which is why Sanders has been a prominent presence in the Golden State lately. In addition to Tuesday\u2019s southern California rally in Carson \u2013 a city that was once home to landfills, refuse dumps and auto dismantling plants \u2013 Sanders is scheduled to appear on Wednesday in San Jose and the formerly bankrupt city of Vallejo. Which prompts the question: what\u2019s he doing if there is little chance he will prevail?   Related: Sanders' endgame: keep the message alive even as nomination slips away    \u201cBernie is trying to accumulate delegates, win some primaries, see where it takes him, how much influence he can have over [the party] platform and future party rules at a minimum,\u201d said Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant who is not affiliated with any candidate. \u201cHe\u2019s also a believer in lightning strikes,\u201d Carrick continued. \u201cIn the old days, presidential campaigns ended when you ran out of money. Senator Sanders doesn\u2019t run out of money \u2026 He has the financial wherewithal to continue in the campaign.\u201d As Sanders noted on Tuesday night in Carson, he has received more than 8 million individual donations with an average value of $27 each. That has fueled his campaign and his optimism \u201cNo one can predict the future but I think we have a real shot to win primaries in a number of the states that will be coming up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell Secretary Clinton. She might get nervous. But I think we\u2019re going to win here in California.\u201d California, he reminded the crowd, had 475 pledged delegates. And how many delegates does he need to overtake Clinton? Around 850 or so. \u201cIt will be a steep climb, I recognize that,\u201d he acknowledged on Tuesday night. \u201cTogether we have been climbing that steep hill from day one in this campaign. And we\u2019re going to continue to fight for every last vote until June 14 and then we\u2019re gonna take our fight into the convention.\u201d And the crowd cheered.",
