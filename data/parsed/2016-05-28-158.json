  "body": "During my schooldays I was forever being told to tuck in my shirt. It bothered me \u2013 I couldn\u2019t see the relationship between my shirt and my ability to learn. One day, when my history teacher barked his familiar request to \u201ctuck that shirt in\u201d, I asked why. I was all but dragged to the deputy headteacher\u2019s office and it was there I first heard about the \u201chidden curriculum\u201d.  We teachers have a peculiar obsession with enforcing dress codes on our students. Checking top buttons are done up, ties are tied, telling people where and when they can wear coats \u2013 we keep vigilant for the most minor transgressions. The reasoning comes from the \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory: if we show zero tolerance to small infractions of the rules, it sends a clear message that greater crimes will be tolerated even less.  In fact, when failing schools start to turn things around, a clampdown on uniform usually marks the beginning of their brave new era. Get the uniform right and the rest will follow.   Related: Secret Teacher: I refuse to let the negativity in teaching bring me down    The past few weeks, however, have been a shocking reminder to me that such sartorial scrutiny is not reserved only for students. For the simple revolutionary act of not to wearing a tie to work for a few days I, a teacher, was once again made to feel like a naughty schoolboy.  As you may have guessed, I have never liked wearing ties \u2013 I find them constrictive and uncomfortable \u2013 but had perceived them as a necessary evil of the job. A while ago I was discussing this with a colleague who pointed out that there was no explicit rule in our school\u2019s dress code about ties, we just needed to look professional. So when the weather warmed up I decided not to wear one. Comfortable and happy, I got on with my job. I noticed a few raised eyebrows, but no one from senior management mentioned anything, and, of course, my students were not fazed. Little did I know, however, that behind the scenes meetings were being held at the highest levels. Then there was a knock at my door. The first manager tried the friendly approach. There was a lot of grinning and attempted camaraderie while I was instructed to reinstate my neckwear. When this failed, a second leader gave me the same message \u2013 without any smiling. Holding my ground, I explained I had already discussed the matter and was awaiting a chat with the head. I had not chosen to go tie-less as an act of rebellion \u2013 this was not the hill I had chosen to die on. But I was becoming increasingly frustrated that such a big deal was being made about this throwaway decision. When Barack Obama met Prince William and Harry on his recent UK visit, neither wore a tie. A tie-less David Cameron was recently seen campaigning for Zac Goldsmith, before Goldsmith was defeated by a tie-less Sadiq Khan. We live in a world where presidents, princes, mayors and ministers regularly carry out state business without wearing a tie. Surely a teacher need not die by this noose? Was I not the same \u201coutstanding\u201d teacher without a tie that I was two weeks ago when I was wearing one? It seemed preposterous that a piece of fabric dangling from my neck could matter so much. But the head finally told me, in no uncertain terms, that a tie was not optional. Her ruling was accompanied by a thinly veiled threat about being valued and how it would be a great shame if I rocked the boat over something as insignificant as a tie.  The only school rule I was breaking was an unwritten one: that we must wear ties to set a good example for the boys who are required to wear them each day. But there are many things staff can do that students cannot. We ignore one-way systems, stay in school buildings at lunchtime and eat and drink in our classrooms. Students are intelligent enough to recognise nuance (and, probably, hypocrisy). Can\u2019t we credit them with that same intelligence when it comes to clothing?

In a profession that demands more and more every year, were they really going to take this from me too? With our breaks frequently given up to detentions, clubs and interventions; our evenings and weekends consumed with marking, planning, reports and paperwork; our holidays given over to wrapping our heads around new syllabuses and specifications, the sliver of personal autonomy I enjoyed when choosing not to wear a tie was a glimmer of freedom. When professional morale is at an all-time low and people are leaving the profession in droves, is it really worth alienating those of us heroically clinging on? Not a single student had their education affected by the absence of my tie, but for those few glorious days I had one less obstacle in the way of enjoying a job that is more and more difficult to love. Ironically, individual liberty is one of the \u201cfundamental British values\u201d we are required to teach but it seems no one \u2013 not students, and least of all teachers \u2013 is allowed the liberty to challenge even the most trivial aspect of a school\u2019s authority.
