  "body": "Jeremy Moberg peers into a microscope at a leaf in a Petri dish. \u201cThrips\u201d, he declares to a man wearing a facemask and surgical gloves. \u201cWe\u2019ll get rid of those with neem oil.\u201d Moberg spotted the pest while cloning in his greenhouse. He\u2019s not your run-of-the-mill biologist or horticulturalist. The 41-year-old owns a marijuana farm with a multi-million dollar turnover in Washington state, USA, where the drug was legalised for recreational use in 2012. His expertise comes from two decades of growing illegally, deep in the woods, dodging the helicopter raids of drug-enforcement officers. The smell of marijuana hangs heavy and pungent in the processing centre, where half a dozen people are clipping flower buds. \u201cYou\u2019re trimming too closely,\u201d he calls to one man working on his cheapest product as he walks to the boardroom. \u201cLeave it shaggier and go faster.\u201d Life is good for Moberg. He\u2019s generated more than $3m in the 20 months since he started the business. However, he says a glut on the market has depressed prices this year, taxes are high and profits are invested back into the farm, so his personal pay cheque is modest. Still, he owns a couple of houses and enjoys eating out, skiing and fishing.    It felt so good when the vote passed to legalise. We drank and sat in the hot tub    As Moberg says, he is a \u201cproduct of circumstance, the right person at the right time\u201d. Four years ago he was on his uppers. He had taken a job as a fisheries ecologist, using his environmental science degree, and stopped growing weed to \u201cgo straight\u201d while involved in a custody battle for his daughter, now 10. Then he was laid off and his life unravelled. With no crop in production, he sold wood to make ends meet, borrowed money from his mother and relied on friends for food. He nearly lost his house and had a difficult break-up with a girlfriend, which led to him being arrested for taking his rucksack out of her car. He was arrested again for stealing a Sim card tray from a shop so he could use his mobile for a job interview. Both charges were later dismissed. That\u2019s important because people with marijuana convictions are often barred from working in the industry. This has meant Black Americans, who were disproportionately targeted in the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, are thought to be missing out on the opportunities created by legalisation. Now Moberg runs a legitimate business, producing and processing 900kg of marijuana a year that he sells to pot shops springing up across the state. And it\u2019s about to become a family affair. His mother, a retired teacher, and his brother, a lawyer, are going into production, too, each having taken leases on farms neighbouring Moberg\u2019s. \u201cIt felt so good when the vote passed to legalise,\u201d Moberg says. \u201cWe drank and sat in the hot tub in the snow. We totally partied. The next morning my pipe, my beer, my weed were still there. I remembered saying: \u2018This is going to be huge.\u2019\u201d      Joint account: Jeremy Moberg\u2019s farm in Okanogan County, Washington. Photograph: Patrick Kehoe for the Observer    I first met Moberg in a coffee shop in Seattle \u2013 a four-hour drive west from his farm \u2013 on his way to deliver tens of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of stock. He was rangy from a food-is-fuel attitude and a hectic schedule, and his face was weathered from a life outdoors. He talked rapidly. It was no surprise that he smoked marijuana to help him sleep at night, although the double-shot espressos probably don\u2019t help. Establishing his business hasn\u2019t been straightforward. Moberg grows outdoors; the conditions in Okanogan are perfect \u2013 hot summers with low humidity. At first it was proposed licences be granted to indoor growers only, largely because of security concerns over open fields of marijuana. Moberg, who spent most of his life terrified of being raided by police or robbed, now had to step forward and argue his case in public. He and fellow growers formed the Washington Sungrowers Industry Association (WSIA), lobbying politicians in Olympia, the state capital, and giving a presentation to the liquor control board.    Moberg\u2019s mother told only close friends about the farm. \u2018There\u2019s prejudice \u2013 even in my quilting group\u2019    Indoor production leaves a large carbon footprint, he told me, because of the electricity needed for intense lighting and air regulation. Sun-grown marijuana \u2013 as he calls outdoor weed \u2013 was more environmentally friendly, he argued, even in Washington, which uses mainly hydropower, considered greener than other energy sources. \u201cIndoor growers use lots of nitrates and phosphates and there\u2019s mercury in the lightbulbs.\u201d He used only vinegar, natural plant-derived oils and potassium bicarbonate.  \u201cIt was prohibition that led to growing indoors in the first place \u2013 to hide it,\u201d he added. This led to a more potent product because it was bombarded with light and fertilisers. \u201cPeople got used to the look and strength of it. There\u2019s a perception that outdoor is crappy because for a long time it was grown illegally in difficult conditions. But I can manipulate the plant by depping [using tarpaulins to deprive plants of light and trick them into flowering] and can produce marijuana that is as good quality.\u201d WSIA\u2019s campaign was successful and licences were granted for outdoor cultivation of up to 30,000sqft. Moberg, now one of more than 600 growers in the state, told me there are strict rules around security and to avoid environmental damage like that caused by illegal outdoor farming in California, where there are cases of water being diverted from salmon-spawning creeks, deforestation and soil erosion.

Photograph: Patrick Kehoe for the Observer    I joined Moberg as he delivered an order to Uncle Ike\u2019s Pot Shop in Seattle. Moberg chatted to the owner, Ian Eisenberg, who said he was now testing the pot he sold for pesticides. Two Washington growers had been fined for using illegal pesticides and regulators in Colorado had recalled several batches over similar concerns.  He pointed towards the lunchtime queue of office workers, hipsters and a couple of middle-aged women in yoga pants. A security guard checked ID at the door \u2013 you have to be over 21 to buy and use marijuana \u2013 and half a dozen \u201cbudtenders\u201d stood in front of shelves filled with bottles of marijuana flowers with names like Girl Scout Cookies, Aliens on Moonshine and Double Lemon Cheesecake, as well as vape pens, pre-rolled joints, oils and waxes, and edibles \u2013 cookies, chocolates and brownies. Eisenberg said: \u201cPeople care about how their chicken is raised, whether it\u2019s in a cage or not, but until now no one cared how their pot was grown. The older crowd is going for non-pesticide now.\u201d    The older crowd is going for non-pesticide now    The roads to Moberg\u2019s CannaSol Farms in Okanogan County, north-central Washington, stretch long and empty, flanked by apple and pear orchards, and fields of alfalfa. There\u2019s no sign marking the anonymous buildings on the one-acre site surrounded by 8ft fences topped with barbed wire and security cameras.  Moberg has been teaching his mother MaryAnn Bennett, 68, how to clone marijuana from a mother plant, so the same strain can be grown repeatedly. She\u2019s giggling at how the nickname for a greenhouse of marijuana plants is the Mother Room. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the hang of it, Mom, just like you did with your roses,\u201d jokes Moberg.  With her long wool skirt, glasses and bobbed hair, she certainly looks more retired elementary school teacher than cannabis farmer. She\u2019s a new convert to the drug. Moberg showed her how to infuse it into sugar and she sprinkles half a teaspoon in her tea every evening to help her sleep.  She intends to grow medicinal marijuana, which is legal in 23 states. Recreational use is legal in Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Colorado as well as Washington DC. \u201cThis is a new venture for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI have senior friends who have really benefitted. One has a serious case of lupus and her joints hurt real badly, and this has really helped her.\u201d  However, Bennett, a churchgoer, adds: \u201cI don\u2019t really talk about it with my friends, just my very close ones. There\u2019s still prejudices and bias, in the churches especially. Even in my quilting group \u2013 they\u2019re older than me, I\u2019m young, some are in their 80s \u2013 there\u2019s a prejudice. I always thought it was less harmful than alcohol. It\u2019s beneficial in certain circumstances. Everyone can use something to excess.\u201d She says she knew nothing of Moberg\u2019s years of guerrilla growing until she heard him speak at a symposium after he\u2019d been granted a licence. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock,\u201d she admits.      \u2018A lot of friends got busted. I used to hide my plants in the woods\u2019: Moberg on his farm. Photograph: Patrick Kehoe for the Observer    Moberg was the \u201chippy kid\u201d growing up in Moses Lake, Washington. His father, since separated from his mother, was a lawyer. When Moberg was in his early teens he became a socialist, experimenting with dope and starting the school\u2019s first recycling programme. His activism wasn\u2019t always well received, particularly during the first Gulf war. \u201cWe had an anti-war group and held a forum\u2026 I got hate mail. I was, like, OK I\u2019m not going to school any more.\u201d His parents sent him to a private school 100 miles away in Spokane, where he lived with his older brother and enjoyed his new-found freedom.  \u201cMe and my friends used to cruise around for hours looking for green bud. We\u2019d find a little bit of weed for 50 bucks, smoke it and go look for it again. That was what probably first made me think there\u2019s a market here.\u201d He was soon growing marijuana in his wardrobe and selling it at school, which ended with him being expelled and then arrested for possession. \u201cI made a deal to spend a month in rehab. It was full of alcoholics, cokeheads and meth heads. I was like: \u2018I just smoke weed, I don\u2019t know what your problem is.\u2019\u201d     This stuff is so strong. Older people get wasted on it. They get sick    Back at high school, he began growing in the basement of a house he shared, and then outdoors. \u201cMe and my buddy would ride motorbikes deep into the woods and grow not very good weed. We had no idea. I was producing around 20lb a year. People could make $50,000 to $100,000 a year from that. It was a big risk and a lot of effort, but a good income for my age.\u201d He made enough to put himself through college. \u201cI\u2019d turn up two weeks late for fall quarter and leave two weeks early. I had a crop to tend.\u201d He bought some property in the North Cascades mountains near where CannaSol Farms now is. \u201cI was just hanging out. My pal had next door. I had a beautiful lake. Those were my back-to-the-land years. I wasn\u2019t making a lot of money, but enough.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound relaxing, however. \u201cI was a hermit. We were very afraid to speak to anyone, even fellow growers. The helicopters came every year and I had a lot of friends who got busted. I hid the plants under trees in the woods. They did find a lot, but they couldn\u2019t prove it was ours unless they caught us with them. \u201cOne time, it was so scary, I couldn\u2019t breathe. Even now when I hear the voom, voom, voom of a chopper, wow\u2026 I reckon I smoke marijuana to help my PTSD from selling marijuana.\u201d In 2002 he got a \u201cproper\u201d job, monitoring habitat in rivers for an environmental consulting firm. He was laid off in 2011. For some of these years, Moberg lived next to the sheriff of Okanogan County. He still does \u2013 growers are not allowed to live on their farms \u2013 and they are on friendly terms. \u201cI think he was like, \u2018Yeah, we knew the whole time,\u2019\u201d says Moberg, laughing.  Sheriff Frank Rogers is weeding the garden of his home in Okanogan. \u201cDon\u2019t mind dead animals, do you?\u201d he yells, striding inside to the living room where half a dozen stag heads and a bobtail cat stare down from the walls. \u201cYeah, I knew Jeremy when he was counting fish, before he got into the legal dope growing. \u201cI knew he grew illegally, they had dope in the house,\u201d he continues. \u201cI could\u2019ve done something, but the trend was towards legalisation. He had a lot more up at his other place, turns out.\u201d     Ready to roll: a CannaSol employee holds a bag of \u2018Dutch Treat\u2019 marijuana ready to be shipped to retailers. Photograph: Patrick Kehoe for the Observer    There has been a mixed reception to legalisation in this rural, conservative area \u2013 48.6%, including Sheriff Rogers, voted against it in Okanogan. There were fears that usage would increase, particularly among young people, leading to more addiction and mental health issues, crime and traffic accidents. \u201cWe do see more people using it,\u201d says Rogers. \u201cOnce it was legalised they were like, hey, we used to smoke this when we were kids. This stuff is so strong, though. They\u2019re hallucinating, having anxiety attacks. These people my age, 55, 60, used to smoke a big bag of crap weed, but on this stuff they get wasted like with booze, they get sick. We\u2019ve seen more problems with kids, too, because getting hold of it is easier \u2013 they can get it from home, steal a little bit from Dad. It\u2019s here to stay. The worse issue here is the meth and heroin, it\u2019s bad.\u201d     My best decisions were made smoking sativa \u2013 it\u2019s the thinking man\u2019s weed    A paper published in the journal Addiction in January stated that while it was too soon to assess many of the effects of legalisation, there was little evidence that more people were using it. There had been an increase, it said, in the number of motorists suspected of driving under the influence testing positive for cannabis. There had also been a dramatic fall in the number of prosecutions for possession (it is legal to carry up to 28g), although African-Americans continued to be three times more likely than whites to be charged, despite comparable rates of use. Rogers worries about visiting houses where people are smoking marijuana. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for cops. I can\u2019t stand and talk to them because I can\u2019t breathe it in. If I then go out and shoot someone, I\u2019ll be automatically tested for drugs and alcohol and it\u2019ll be in my system. We ask to talk to them outside.\u201d  Andi Ervin, of the Okanogan County Community Coalition, which works to reduce youth substance abuse, believes regular cannabis use affects the developing teenage brain. She says data shows that the percentage of teenagers in the state who thought there was no risk of harm from regular use had jumped between 2008 and 2014. There\u2019s another issue, too \u2013 Rogers has received complaints about the smell coming from the farms, which travels a couple of miles during harvest. \u201cThe county stinks,\u201d he tells me. However, the \u201cgreen rush\u201d \u2013 which is producing millions in tax revenues for the state \u2013 has also brought economic benefits to the county, one of the poorest in Washington. There are more than 50 licensed growers in Okanogan now who are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars locally on equipment, labour and construction work. Moberg is in the greenhouse inspecting his mother plants. He describes how Cannabis sativa strains make users more alert, while C indica is more sedate. What does he prefer? \u201cAll my best decisions were made when I was smoking sativa, it\u2019s thinking man\u2019s weed,\u201d he says, as an employee comes in to tell him he\u2019s needed at a meeting. \u201cBut I don\u2019t get to smoke as much as I did,\u201d he adds ruefully. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the time.\u201d",
