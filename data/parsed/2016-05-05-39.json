  "body": "When you\u2019re a tabloid with a largely working-class readership it\u2019s difficult to spin a budget that slugs smokes and booze and hands out tax cuts to business. But Rupert Murdoch\u2019s the Daily Telegraph jumped through hoops to portray the Coalition\u2019s 2016 budget as a winner despite the lack of perks for the average reader.  With an election soon upon us the treasurer, Scott Morrison, was depicted on the front page of Wednesday\u2019s paper as a muscle-bound Superman, complete with a skintight blue suit and a red cape. Superman might not help the average worker but the Tele\u2019s \u201cSco-Mo\u201d is \u201cthe hero of the hard worker\u201d. \u201cJust don\u2019t drink, smoke or be rich,\u201d the Tele added down the bottom.  The paper\u2019s relatively new editor, Chris Dore, prides himself on making a splash with his front pages and, with tensions running high between Dore and the Australian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Paul Whittaker, over his poaching of Tele staff, Dore was keen to prove his mettle as Whittaker\u2019s successor. Whittaker\u2019s Oz was similarly laudatory with the headline SCOMO\u2019S SUPER TAX TRICK and portrayed the treasurer as a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, albeit a very small one. GQ\u2019s editor turns the page   Related: Richard Di Natale opens up to GQ on pacts, policy and dealing with the Liberals    Shortly after he made headlines with his cover of the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, in a black skivvy, GQ\u2019s editor, Matthew Drummond, abruptly resigned. The former Australian Financial Review journalist had been in the job for less than a year.  They don\u2019t muck around at GQ. They have already amended his byline on the website to read \u201cMatthew Drummond, Former GQ Australia Editor\u201d. Mason and the jargonauts The director of ABC Radio, Michael Mason, was clearly not bowed by our exposure last month of his plan to introduce a raft of \u201cpreposterously named executives\u201d to radio management.  The titles \u2013 which sounded like they came straight out of an episode of the ABC satire on bureaucracy Utopia \u2013 included \u201cCapital Local Lead\u201d, \u201cHead, Spoken\u201d and \u201cClassical Lead\u201d.  Earlier this week Mason was at it again, telling staff in a jargon-riddled email all about how he had a strategy for improving diversity on ABC Radio. Keen to impress the new boss, his missive came just hours after Michelle Guthrie told staff she was keen to focus on diversity. Mason told staff he had already established a diversity action group or, ahem, a \u201cDAG\u201d, to focus on how ABC Radio can look and sound more like Australia by 2020. Some questions he wanted them to think about were: \u201cDo we (however unconsciously) avoid using talent because they have a \u2018difficult\u2019 accent? \u201cHow do we make sure that we\u2019re not basing our scripts and interviews on old ideas and assumptions about the average Aussie? \u201cWhich \u2018forgotten\u2019 communities would it be good to seek views from? How do we do that? When we do [outside broadcasts], for example, do we go to the same places every time?\u201d It even included tips for interviewing people with heavy accents: \u201cAim for face to face where possible; pre-recording allows for editing; be ready to rephrase your questions if you\u2019re not immediately understood; if appropriate repeat answers you\u2019ve been given before moving onto your next question.\u201d Coalition chooses between channels With the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, claiming in a budget statement that the government was \u201csupporting\u201d and \u201cinvesting\u201d in public broadcasting, and the lobby group Friends of the ABC saying the government had slashed $50m from Aunty in the budget, we thought we should clarify matters.  Yes the Coalition has maintained the ABC\u2019s base funding of $3.1bn over three years but it has only partially supported the additional tied funding the news division has received for the past three years. A $20m boost under Labor has been cut to $13.5m per annum \u2013 or a $41.4m cut over the next three years \u2013 meaning there will have to be some cuts to staff and programs, possibly to the Fact Check Unit.    Related: New ABC chief faces budget shortfall and Senate estimates in first week of job    As news director Gaven Morris told staff: \u201cNow we know exactly what we\u2019re dealing with, we will develop a proposal on which to consult with staff and unions as soon as possible. We always knew the additional funding was a three-year proposition but the prospect of losing good people and quality services is still extremely difficult. We are determined to minimise the impact on our staff whilst also ensuring we are able to reinvest in our digital future and continue our commitment to regional and local news-gathering.\u201d  The government also failed to renew a one-off lump sum that was granted to be spent on digitisation and digital delivery. (This is how the Friends came up with the $50m figure.) The $41.4m cut is on top of the $250m cut under the Abbott government in 2014, which imposed an ongoing \u201cefficiency dividend\u201d \u2013 6.5% this year. While the government is taking from the ABC, it has found the cash to lighten the load of the commercial broadcasters by a not insignificant $163m. It has reduced the licence fees paid by Seven, Nine and Ten by 25% this year in recognition that the Australian media market has changed \u201cwith the move to online and on-demand content fragmenting the market for media services and increasing competition for audiences and advertising dollars\u201d. The competition is coming from Netflix and Apple TV who pay no licence fees. Fairfax strike under scrutiny Back in March staff at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age in Melbourne walked off the job after Fairfax Media announced it will lose a further 120 journalists.  In what unions say is a very unusual decision, the Fair Work Ombudsman has launched an investigation into the unprotected three-day strike and ordered the company to hand over the contact details of everyone who walked off the job. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance is providing staff with legal advice. Word is beginning to trickle out about who is leaving and the sport department will be decimated.  The Age\u2019s award-winning cricket writer Peter Hanlon has taken redundancy and Jake Niall has already left to join Fox Sports. In another blow to the Age, management has dropped its separate education section as well as the Third Degree blog written by Erica Cervini.    @tim_grainger Due to cutbacks at The Age the separate education section is going, including Third Degree. Education continues in news pages.\u2014 Erica Cervini (@thirddegreeblog) May 2, 2016",
