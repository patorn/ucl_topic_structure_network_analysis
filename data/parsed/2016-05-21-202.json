  "body": "On Friday evening my wife receives a\u00a0text from a neighbour asking us to keep the noise down. It is a jokey, good-humoured text, but it contains a\u00a0grain of seriousness: there is too much noise. My wife\u2019s breezy reply has a similar frankness at its core. \u201cI\u2019m in Frome\u201a\u201d it says. We are both in Frome, on one of those rare occasions when my wife comes to see the band play. Our normal strategy when leaving the house overnight is to keep the news from the children until the last minute, to prevent them making plans. It seems we have not reckoned with their knack for impromptu socialising.      My wife sends a text to the youngest one telling him to vacate the garden. A few minutes later she receives another text from the neighbour assuring her that all is now eerily quiet. On Saturday my wife arrives home hours before I do \u2013 I have another gig to play. She sends me a text that makes our miscalculation plain: our night away coincided with the last day of classes for the upper sixth. Upwards of 30 of them found their way to our house. Everything, she says, is suspiciously clean. When I get home late that night the house seems to be in reasonable order. A few sofa cushion covers have been removed, presumably for washing. I don\u2019t look too closely at the rest of it. The next morning my wife is already out of bed when I wake up. I find her in the garden, picking plastic cups out of the wisteria. \u201cI\u2019m amazed there weren\u2019t more complaints,\u201d she says. The beds, I notice, are marked by deep\u00a0footprints. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s a chicken,\u201d she says.      I go back inside and turn on the oven. I\u00a0hear nothing but the faint hum of an electric\u00a0lawnmower in the distance. In a few months, I\u00a0think, the middle one will be at university. The youngest will follow a year later.\u00a0All too soon eerie silence will be the norm. I look up to see Constance standing in the\u00a0doorway. \u201cGod I feel awful,\u201d she says. \u201cHave you got any nail varnish remover?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not staying for lunch,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t!\u201d Constance says, rolling a fag. \u201cI\u2019m playing tennis at two.\u201d Constance stays for lunch. The youngest one comes downstairs, brimming with hair-raising recollections from the party. \u201cOne guy was running up and down the stairs in your bathrobe,\u201d he tells me. \u201cGoing, \u2018I\u2019m Tim Dowling! I\u2019m Tim Dowling!\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like that,\u201d my wife says. The middle one appears, looking drained but pleased with himself. He shows me a picture on his phone of someone wearing my bathrobe. The\u00a0doorbell rings. \u201cThat\u2019s Pat,\u201d my wife says. \u201cLet him in.\u201d Pat introduced me to my wife 30 years ago and regards our married life as a cautionary tale performed for his benefit. He surveys the scene before him with a look that says: another edifying chapter. Then he sits down to read the paper.      \u201cHave you ever actually played tennis before?\u201d the middle one says to Constance. \u201cI lied and said I could,\u201d she says. Her phone\u00a0rings. \u201cHe had a bath in your bath as well,\u201d the youngest one says. \u201cWho did?\u201d I say. \u201cGet plates!\u201d my wife shrieks. It occurs to me that the eerie silence of lunches yet to come is still a long way away. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re in the neighbourhood, just come here,\u201dConstance says into her phone. \u201cNo!\u201d shouts my wife. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t her saying no,\u201d Constance says. \u201cJust push the bell.\u201d",
