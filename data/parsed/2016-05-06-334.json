  "body": "The Extraordinary Collector 8pm, BBC2 The collector in question is Gordon Watson, one of those fortunate people who has managed to turn his compulsion \u2013 in his case, the acquisition and sale of 20th-century art \u2013 into a profitable living. This film follows Watson as he pitches to a dream client \u2013 Lord Jacob Rothschild, both a connoisseur of antiques and one of Britain\u2019s richest men. The real selling point, however, is the rare glimpse into Rothschild\u2019s estate, and its own extraordinary collection. Andrew Mueller The Secret 9pm, ITV \u201cTonight\u2019s on, we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d says dentist Colin Howell to his lover, teacher Hazel Buchanan. He\u2019s talking about murdering the duo\u2019s respective spouses and making the deaths look like a joint suicide. The way this drama, based on the true story of these killings, so convincingly conjures up a conservative world where unhappiness is supposed to be endured rather than escaped only makes these scenes, which fill much of the episode, all the more unsettling. Jonathan Wright The Windsors 10pm, Channel 4 Super-silly sitcom about the royal family from the creators of Star Stories, Bert Tyler Moore and George Jeffrie. The gags bang and whoosh like a New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display and W1A\u2019s Hugh Skinner is outstanding (and somehow even posher than before) as Prince William, backed up nicely by Harry Enfield as a mildly demented Prince Charles and Haydn Gwynne as a conniving Camilla. The result is quite joyfully daft throughout. Knighthoods all round. Julia Raeside When Pop Went Epic: The Crazy World of the Concept Album 10pm, BBC4 Concept albums are the true tightrope-walkers of rock. Get it right, you\u2019ve got yourself a Quadrophenia. Take a misstep, you\u2019re left with Yes\u2019s Tales from Topographic Oceans \u2013 the sound of Pinky and Perky thrashing around in a cutlery drawer. Former Yes-man Rick Wakeman gamely revisits the latter, along with the likes of Pink Floyd\u2019s The Wall, George Clinton\u2019s Mothership Connection and the Flaming Lips\u2019 Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. Ali Catterall Rick Stein\u2019s Long Weekends 9pm, BBC2 WIth Nigella hyping avocado toast and chia seeds in her last TV outing, it wasn\u2019t going to be long before other famous foodies started gushing about zeitgeisty nosh. And so, Padstow\u2019s finest lands in Berlin for the latest instalment of his new series, probing postwar architecture, guerrilla chefs and food he terms as \u201ccutting-edge and arrogant\u201d before polishing it off. It\u2019s an odd fit but, as per, Stein\u2019s have-a-go enthusiasm is infectious. Hannah Jane Davies Hoff the Record 10pm, Dave Series two of the workmanlike self-satire continues to walk through all the tropes that made mockumentaries cool 10 years ago. David Hasselhoff plays himself as a daringly plausible caricature, with his disastrous career marshalled by Thick of It spinners, who give Office-style interviews commentating on the action. Tonight, low earnings cause the Hoff to fake his own death. It\u2019s efficient, but every line is the most agonising thing comedy can be: nearly funny. Jack Seale Jack Irish: Blind Faith 10pm, Fox The gritty, witty Aussie crime drama starring an increasingly battered Guy Pearce continues. Jack\u2019s estranged journo girlfriend Linda and her crafty Philippines bureau chief Orton finally discover the aftermath of the Mindanao village massacre that opened the series. But where are all the bodies? Meanwhile, back in Melbourne, Jack manages to finagle a face-to-face with Pastor Rob, the head of the shady megachurch seemingly behind his frame-up. Graeme Virtue TV films The Core (Jon Amiel, 2003), 6.20pm, Film4 You\u2019d think Hollywood had exhausted the disaster movie scenario, but this one ingeniously imagines trouble at the centre of the Earth, where electromagnetic mumbo-jumbo is stopping the world going round. As an intrepid team start drilling their way towards the core armed with a nuclear solution, there are vivid special effects on display, plus a witty script and a refreshingly alternative cast, including Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Tch\u00e9ky Karyo and Stanley Tucci. Paul Howlett Fight Club (David Fincher, 1999), 11.35pm, 5Star Fincher\u2019s ferocious drama stars Edward Norton as an insomniac businessman who is led into a whole new way of life by Brad Pitt\u2019s soap salesman, Tyler Durden. At their fight club, where ordinary guys batter each other to pulp in bareknuckle contests, they embrace a world of anarchic violence, and the club expands into a nationwide movement. A darkly brilliant satire adapted from Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s novel.
