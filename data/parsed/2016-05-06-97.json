  "body": "Zainab al-Khawaja, the Bahraini political activist, is still languishing in gaol a month after a promise - made under rare international pressure - that she be freed. The Gulf state, a close military and economic partner of western governments, is ignoring a direct appeal by the US to release her. Khawaja, convicted of insulting an official and tearing up a picture of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, is in cell 19, Issa Town Women\u2019s Prison, with her baby son. Her case has attracted global attention because of her own reputation and that of her father, Abdel-Hadi, serving a life sentence for calling for the overthrow of the Sunni monarchy. Amnesty International has adopted her as a \u201cprisoner of conscience.\u201d Thousands of supporters agree. \u201cMy cause is the cause of my people,\u201d Khawaja wrote in a letter smuggled out of prison recently. \u201cIf nothing changes for the people of Bahrain, then my staying in jail or release is not of great consequence.\u201d Khawaja is no stranger to trouble. She was last detained in February on the fifth anniversary of the 2011 crackdown on the protests of the \u201cPearl Revolution.\u201d That early chapter of the Arab spring triggered a Saudi-led military intervention and left Bahrain in a state of political paralysis. Bahrain\u2019s opposition is well represented abroad - partly because some activists have been stripped of their citizenship. Supporters are adept at campaigning in the US, Britain and other countries which view the island state as a strategic ally and lucrative market for business and investment. Washington and London also care about the headquarters of the US Fifth Fleet, and a new base being built for the Royal Navy. And they struggle to address accusations of discrimination against Bahrain\u2019s Shia-majority population. The British government, MPs and activists complain, has all but fallen silent. \u201cThe Foreign Office say they support human rights defenders,\u201d said Sayed Alwadaei of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, \u201cbut they have failed the defenders in Bahrain. We want to see them start by calling for Zainab\u2019s release.\u201d So it was a big deal when Khawaja - Twitter handle @AngryArabiya - had her case raised by John Kerry, the US secretary of state, visiting Manama last month on the eve of a Gulf summit Barack Obama was attending. Bahrain\u2019s foreign minister Khaled bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said she would be freed, though the case would continue to be pursued. Kerry\u2019s reference to \u201crespect for human rights and an inclusive political system\u201d was criticised by some as \u201ctepid.\u201d But it did not go unnoticed in a small country where at least 3000 people are in prison for taking part in protests and are often labelled \u201cterrorists.\u201d And his intervention followed a unprecedented meeting with five senior opposition figures - \u201ca huge event,\u201d in the words of one Manama observer. The US sent another unmistakeable signal this week when the state department publicly \u201curged\u201d Bahrain to keep its promise and free Khawaja. Khawaja is not alone. Sheikh Ali Salman of al-Wefaq, the largest Shia opposition movement, is behind bars. So is the (Sunni) Ibrahim Sharif of the leftwing Waad party. Nabeel Rajab, the human rights activist, has been effectively silenced by a travel ban and laws that criminalise political comments on social media. The Bahraini government has been trying to improve its image by pointing the finger at Iran. There\u2019s no question that the Islamic Republic is hostile, bracketing the Al Khalifa with their Saudi allies. Its propaganda is relentless and crude. Hamad has spoken of \u201ccompelling evidence of flagrant (Iranian) interference\u201d in his country\u2019s internal affairs. But it has never been publicly spelled put. Nightly clashes in the Shia villages around Manama, where masked youngsters burn tyres, build barricades and throw rocks at police vehicles, do not require sophisticated foreign support. \u201cBlaming Iran is something the government says to foreigners,\u201d scoffs an independent Bahraini. \u201cNo-one here believes it.\u201d Bahraini officials and commentators radiate hostility to the US in the same way Saudis do \u2013 seeing in Obama a president who has \u201ctilted\u201d to an aggressive Tehran over its nuclear programme and failed to intervene decisively in the Syrian crisis. Instability in Iraq and war in Yemen, much closer to home, have also sharpened regional sectarian tensions. Manama loyally followed Riyadh and severed its diplomatic links with Iran following attacks on Saudi diplomatic premises after the execution of the Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr in January.  \u201cBahrain is trying to play for time,\u201d argues Ali al-Aswad, a former Wefaq MP. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to upset the loyalists. I am not optimistic that they will release Zainab soon. She is really putting pressure on the government. I am not sure they will do what Kerry said.\u201d So Khawaja\u2019s fate is being carefully watched - as a small sign, perhaps, of the way the Gulf winds are blowing.",
