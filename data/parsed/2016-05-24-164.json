In terms of legitimately awful portents, Cameron\u2019s Micra is up there with the ravens leaving the Tower of London and Boris Johnson deliberately mussing up his hair before a\u00a0public speaking engagement. Only bad things can happen from now on. We\u2019re doomed. What does Cameron\u2019s Micra mean? There are only two options. Option one: the starting pistol has been fired on the EU referendum campaign proper. With a four-week purdah set to kick in on Friday, banning the Treasury from publishing data about the public cost of Brexit, politicians will now be forced to get their message across in other ways. Televised debates. Town hall meetings. And, most gallingly of all, woeful attempts to find common ground with the voting public. In short, the race is on for everyone to look as normal as possible. Buckle up, guys. This is going to be excruciating. Because Cameron\u2019s Micra has to be an attempt for him to look normal, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just too perfectly convenient to be anything else. The timing is too convenient. The car dealer\u2019s selfie is too convenient. The fact that Cameron managed to chance upon one of the precious few members of the public who doesn\u2019t automatically start humping the air and making pig noises at the very sight of him is too\u00a0convenient. And of course he paid full price for it. Of course he did. He wouldn\u2019t have insulated himself against accusations of hurting small business owners if this wasn\u2019t all a great big publicity stunt. Cameron is a famed negotiator, but suddenly he can\u2019t even get \u00a3300 knocked off a\u00a0Nissan Micra? This is a man who once waited nine full hours without going to the toilet because he refused to leave a negotiating table until he got what he wanted. At the very least, he could have secured a free air freshener by threatening to wee all over the forecourt. But no.     The Nissan Micra \u2018lacks the visual impact of the Kia Picanto\u2019.    What on earth is Cameron going to do with a\u00a0\u00a31,495 Nissan Micra, anyway? He doesn\u2019t need it. He\u2019s the prime minister, for crying out loud. His time is so vastly important that his security detail deliberately arranged for him to arrive at the dealership at precisely 17.32. If every second of your life is accounted for like this, then the last thing you should do is put your faith in a\u00a0vehicle that Autocar once said \u201clacks the visual impact of the Kia\u00a0Picanto\u201d. Oh, sure, the official line is that it was a gift for Samantha, but she\u2019s hardly going to be thrilled about that, is she? A secondhand car to go along with all those cheap high-street dresses she has to wear to conferences to blend in, and the memories of all those dismal staycations she has to keep taking in order to look normal? No, the only logical explanation is that Cameron bought the car because he wanted to fill it with rubies, set it on fire, put a brick on the accelerator and watch it plummet off a cliff while he yells: \u201cBuller buller buller!\u201d at it. That is the only logical explanation. Still, we should be thankful that Cameron was chosen to represent the remain side here instead of, say, George Osborne. Cameron\u2019s photo just makes him look like a slightly clueless man buying a car. With Osborne, there would by now be a Vine of him staring off into space, repeatedly tasting the air with the tip of his tongue, like some sort of horrifying circus iguana having a nightmarish fractal flashback. And this isn\u2019t the worst of it. In the days to come, now that Cameron has signalled the start of his \u201cHey! I\u2019m just like you! Hooray for Europe!\u201d campaign, the Brexiters are destined to follow suit. And that will just be an absolute mess from start to finish. Even in their jobs \u2013 their real life, nebbish jobs that they really do for an actual living \u2013 the leave campaigners all tend to come across like space aliens who have crashed on Earth and can\u2019t yet manage to convincingly mimic human behaviour. Imagine Michael Gove trying to relate to normal people in a pub. Imagine how hard you would wince if Boris Johnson visited a nursing home. Imagine if you saw Nigel Farage holding a puppy. You wouldn\u2019t know if he was going to stroke it or eat it. You\u2019d have nightmares. Politicians should have learned that nobody is fooled by all these attempts to relate to us. Every time it happens, it stinks of inauthenticity. They\u2019re doomed to be forever undone by a\u00a0leotard or a pint of beer or a fumbled conversation about Aston Villa. Every political career in the country is just one bacon sandwich away from oblivion, and yet these sham performances continue. Politicians aren\u2019t like us, and that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s actually quite heartening to realise that they\u2019re too busy to buy a secondhand car or get into the Arctic Monkeys. So drop the act, Cameron. We can see right through you. A Nissan Micra. A Nissan bloody Micra. Who the hell do you think we\u00a0are? Option two: David Cameron just wanted to do a nice thing for his wife. That\u2019s feasible, too, I\u00a0suppose.",
