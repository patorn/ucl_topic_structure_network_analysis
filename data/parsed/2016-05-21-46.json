  "body": "Manu Tuilagi is likely to miss England\u2019s tour of Australia with a hamstring injury picked up in Saracens\u2019 44-17 win over Leicester in the first of the Premiership play-offs. On a disappointing day for Eddie Jones \u2013 who announces his England squad on Sunday \u2013 his midfield may be further disrupted by the loss of Owen Farrell, who came off in the same game clutching his ribs. The Saracens fly-half is touch-and-go for next weekend\u2019s final. But Tuilagi is the main concern for England. It is understood the centre, who has been plagued by groin and hamstring injuries for two years, has suffered a grade-two hamstring tear, which he has suffered before, an injury that tends to carry a six-week layoff. Richard Cockerill, his director of rugby, was unable to confirm the extent of the injury, but said: \u201cManu\u2019s pulled his hamstring. I don\u2019t know how badly. We\u2019ll assess it over the next 48 hours. He came off pretty quickly, so it doesn\u2019t look brilliant, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d Mark McCall was similarly uncertain about Farrell\u2019s injury, picked up when he was hit by two tackles in the same passage of play. \u201cI don\u2019t know the extent of it yet. He\u2019s got a bang on the rib, and you know ribs can go one way or the other. Hopefully, it\u2019s the right way.\u201d Cockerill refused to blame Tuilagi\u2019s early exit for the result, but once again expressed his dislike for the artificial surface at Allianz Park.\u201cIf you get more purchase on the pitch, you put more force through your body and that causes more problems,\u201d Cockerill said. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the artificial pitches at all. For me they could take them all out and make every Premiership side have a DESSO field (grass mixed with natural fibres) or a proper grass one that\u2019s mixed so that you have a good surface for the whole year.\u201d",
