  "body": "\u201cPopular science has an element of art, even entertainment.\u201d So writes the American psychologist Lauren Slater in her 2004 book, here adapted by the multifaceted theatre company Improbable in a co-production with Northern Stage and West Yorkshire Playhouse. Slater\u2019s subtitle is Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century. What interests Slater are the stories around the experiments as much as the experiments themselves. She interviews scientists and their subjects, imagines details of their personal lives, entwines her own life into the accounts and into the experiments, concluding: \u201cNo matter how technologically proficient our newest experiments, we cannot escape the residue of mystery and murk, so we carry the residue with us \u2026 We live our lives, each one a divine hypothesis.\u201d    Words garble along, tripping tongues tell what should be transformed into event    Improbable\u2019s adaptation, directed by Phelim McDermott and Lee Simpson, follows the narrative faithfully - too faithfully. For much of the time, we seem to be watching a lecture coming straight off the page. White lines mark out a giant cube in a black space; Laura Hopkins\u2019s design a visual cue for the boxes in which the eponymous Skinner shaped the behaviour of his rat subjects. Six actors wearing brown suits with coloured bow ties move through this box and a range of roles - human and animal. Words garble along, tripping tongues tell what should be transformed into event. One example: Harry Harlow\u2019s experiments showing that baby monkeys prefer a cuddly dummy mother over a metal milk-giving one. On stage are: Harry, dummies and monkeys. But Harry doesn\u2019t discover; he describes his discovery. As monkeys to touch, so audiences to action: we need it; it stimulates engagement and communication. Slater\u2019s book is entertaining as well as informative and thought-provoking - if this stage adaptation were less in thrall to the page, it would be truer to her writing. \u2022 Opening Skinner\u2019s Box is at West Yorkshire Playhouse from 5-14 May; and Bristol Old Vic, 20-21 May",
