His three-day trip has been seen as an attempt to bolster Vietnam\u2019s capacity to deal with China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea. China has built military installations, including runways and missile launchers, on reclaimed islands, often in areas also claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Japan. The South China Sea is thought to have significant oil and gas reserves and is a route for about $4.5tn (\u00a33.2tn) in trade. Washington is nervous about Beijing\u2019s growing assertiveness in the area. China\u2019s state-run Global Times said on Tuesday that the White House \u201cis taking advantage of Vietnam to stir up more troubles in the South China Sea\u201d. The trip, which has also promoted the US-inspired Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, has been criticised by activists and US politicians who say it backs the one-party Vietnamese state and its poor human rights record.

About 100 prisoners are in jail for political reasons. In March, seven activists were sentenced by the Communist party, which has ruled since 1954, for \u201cspreading anti-state propaganda\u201d. During his Tuesday speech, Obama said that he was impressed with the Vietnamese people for \u201craising your voices for causes that you care about\u201d and said Vietnam\u2019s constitution included rights to freedom of speech and the freedom of the press. The president did meet six activists during his trip but acknowledged that several Vietnamese civil society members were prevented from seeing him. He said Washington had \u201csignificant areas of concern\u201d about political freedom in Vietnam. Nguyen Quang A, a prominent critic of the Vietnamese government, told Reuters he was taken by police from his home early on Tuesday so that he would be unable to meet Obama in Hanoi. He said he was forced into a car by a group of officers, driven out of the capital, and held for over five hours. On Sunday, the BBC reporting team was told their accreditation to cover Obama\u2019s visit had been withdrawn without reason. On Monday, in a joint news conference with the Vietnamese president, Tran Dai Quang, Obama said \u201cmodest\u201d human rights improvements had been made. He said any weapons sales would need to meet strict requirements \u201cincluding those related to human rights\u201d. The president will fly to Ho Chi Minh City later on Tuesday. The city was formerly known as Saigon before it was taken over by North Vietnamese communist forces in 1975, ending the war with US-backed fighters in the south. From Vietnam, Obama will travel to Japan for a G7 summit and a visit to Hiroshima.",
