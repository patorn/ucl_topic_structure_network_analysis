  "body": "Andrew Michael Hurley likes to know which part of The Loney unsettles you the most. It\u2019s different for everyone: is it the setting \u2013 a decrepit house on a \u201cwild and useless length of English coastline\u201d? Or the occasional touch of gothic \u2013 a girl\u2019s face glimpsed in a window, an effigy of Jesus found hanging in a wet wood, a crown of thorns topping a sheep skull? Or simply the relentless tension \u2013 who will go the furthest to cure a mute boy: his fanatical mother or the presence she believes is God, but the reader knows, deep down, is something else entirely? In person, Hurley is a little rumpled, but cheerful. He has just won the best debut and book of the year prizes at the British Book Industry awards (BBIA) and is living what sounds like a debut author\u2019s dream: after 300 copies of The Loney were published quietly by small Yorkshire press Tartarus in November 2014, two months later a few doozy reviews brought it to the attention of one of the UK\u2019s most venerable publishers, John Murray. It was picked as a book of the year by the Sunday Times, Daily Mail, Daily Express, Daily Telegraph and Times. Horror grandmaster Stephen King called it \u201can amazing piece of fiction\u201d. In January 2016, Hurley won the Costa first novel award. Today, he\u2019s in his publisher\u2019s office in London, with a sore head but two fresh BBIA\u2019s under his belt (he texted his kids to tell them he had won a prize, but they were more interested that he sat next to Youtube celebrity Joe Sugg). In conversation, he frequently anticipates imaginary accusations of flippancy in the face of his success: \u201cIt has been totally bewildering and strange and brilliant. No one has been more surprised than I have. I know that sounds like false modesty \u2013 but I think all writers feel the same. But The Loney has been so universally loved, which is astonishing. I was just so happy for it to be published, I didn\u2019t really have much more ambition for it than that \u2013 oh, that sounds daft, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d The Loney follows a family on their annual pilgrimage to a decrepit house on a bleak coast: the 15-year-old narrator, his mute brother and their timid father and fanatically Catholic mother, who believes her son can be cured with a visit to a local shrine. With their local priest and a gaggle of fellow churchgoers in tow, tensions build and rituals become increasingly sinister. The feeling of being on the brink of something awful, something unseen, pervades The Loney like a sickness. Hurley\u2019s young narrator observes: \u201cThere was so little of the modern world there that it was difficult not to think of the place being at a sort of standstill and \u2013 how shall I put it \u2013 primed in some way.\u201d   Related: The Loney by Andrew Michael Hurley review \u2013 eerily good    Is The Loney horror? Literary fiction? A thriller? No one really knows \u2013 but no one seems unduly bothered. It\u2019s the confidence of the debut that resonates, even with those wary of horror. \u201cPeople said, \u2018Where will this go in a bookshop?\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t answer that for a long time,\u201d Hurley says, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s funny that the thing I thought would be a drawback made it remarkable.\u201d Hurley, who is 41 and has previously published two short story collections, spent spent three or four years to writing the novel, plotting it out in the evenings and weekends while he worked part-time as a creative writing teacher and librarian. He sent The Loney out into the world to a chorus of polite \u2018no\u2019s, before he found and approached Tartarus. \u201cThey had this caveat on their website that said \u2018unless it\u2019s very strange, we probably won\u2019t be interested\u2019. That was perfect for me,\u201d he says.  Writing short stories first taught him the power of economy, he says. He loves the great names of the genre \u2013 Raymond Carver, Hemingway, John Cheever, Chekhov. Brevity pairs well with gothic horror, he says, as it leaves gaps for readers to invest in. \u201cLeave them more questions than are answered. For me the most genuinely unsettling stories are those ones where you don\u2019t see everything. There is no place more terrifying than your own mind \u2013 if the monsters exist in there, that will unsettle you more than if it is spelled out for you.\u201d     \u2018Gothic literature says: \u2018No, nature does not care about you and it can hurt\u2019 \u2026 Andrew Michael Hurley. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    The Loney has an open ending, leaving the readers to construct the horrors beyond. This took a lot of drafts, Hurley says, but it was important that \u201cyou knew something had happened, but quite what it was or why, you weren\u2019t entirely sure.\u201d (He, however, knows what it is.) Horror writer MR James, particularly his short story Oh, Whistle, And I\u2019ll Come To You, My Lad, was a huge influence, he says. \u201cAt the end he describes this crumpled face of linen. That\u2019s all it is, but it is this horrific, unsettling, uncanny image, of an entity whose motivations are never disclosed. That is quite disturbing.\u201d Hurley\u2019s odd title (\u201cIt is a bugger to Google\u201d) comes from an actual place: a local nickname for a wasteland on the River Ribble, in his hometown of Preston, Lancashire. \u201cIt was a place you were warned away from by parents: \u2018You don\u2019t go to the Loney as strange people hang out there.\u2019 Of course, all kids went there. When it came to writing my novel I had my title immediately. I just had to lift it from Preston and put it on the coast.\u201d One element of Hurley\u2019s debut that has been most frequently remarked on is the sense of place. Even without knowing England\u2019s coast, you can smell the salt in the air, imagine trudging through sodden, fetid leaves. There, time doesn\u2019t \u201cleak away as it should\u201d but \u201ccollected as the black water did on the marshes and remained and stagnated in the same way\u201d. Gone is any sense of the English pastoral; The Loney shrieks with storms, looms in drizzle. Hurley is fascinated by humanity\u2019s refusal to accept nature\u2019s indifference. \u201cYes, there is something comforting in the idea that your tiny little insignificant life could be mapped out and there is order and purpose to it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe cycle of the seasons being representative of an afterlife, that spring will always come after the winter kills everything \u2026 gothic literature says: \u2018No, nature does not care about you and it can hurt.\u2019 There is a sort of existential angst about these places.\u201d Mummer, the overbearing matriarch, attributes the landscape\u2019s fury as evidence of God, a link Hurley is fascinated by: \u201cShe believes these elemental forces are examples of God at work, that it is something quantifiable or benevolent even when it is wild. But no, there is something malevolent about that weather; it can kill you.\u201d He drew on memories of pottering about in nature with his older sister: \u201cI remember those feelings of being frightened by it. You look at those mountain ranges in the Lake District and suddenly the cloud comes down \u2026 when even the adults are edgy about it, that\u2019s when nature becomes quite scary and serious.\u201d Hurley was bought up in a big Catholic family and was an altar boy before he stopped believing. \u201cI lost my faith when I was 12 or 13, but the imagery and the language of mass stayed with me as an adult.\u201d Despite his atheism, he is fascinated by the church and the purpose of faith; while writing The Loney, Hurley thought of his grandparents, whose social lives revolved around their religion. \u201cIt gave them a very simple framework to live by. I completely understand why people want that in their lives, why wouldn\u2019t you? But you only have to switch on the TV on any given day of the week to see what religion also permits \u2013 the worst atrocities you can imagine. Trying to square those two things is what The Loney is about.\u201d   Related: Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter    Hurley has just submitted his second novel (\u201ca blessed relief\u201d) and has ideas for a nonfiction book on solitude and nature. After the success of his first, it is understandable that second book fears are weighing on him a little. \u201cI do have to put that out of my mind or I\u2019ll never write another word,\u201d he chuckles. But he\u2019s sticking to the form: \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful playground,\u201d he says. \u201cA fascinating, maddening, disturbing, beautiful thing.\u201d He\u2019s planning a \u201cloose trilogy\u201d of unconnected novels about the Lancashire landscape, with the second set on the moorlands near where he lives and looking at myths and reinterpretations. \u201cIt will be dark and unsettling,\u201d he promises, cheerfully.",
