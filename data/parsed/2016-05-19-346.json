  "body": "Labor criticising Peter Dutton for saying asylum seekers would take Australian jobs amounted to \u201cdemonisation\u201d of the immigration minister, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, says. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, shot back that \u201cpeople in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones\u201d. He said Dutton had demonised migrants and Turnbull had backed him. On Tuesday Dutton said many asylum seekers weren\u2019t \u201cnumerate or literate in their own language, let alone English\u201d and were unemployed or would \u201clanguish on unemployment queues\u201d. Turnbull said Labor was \u201ccrab-walking to the left\u201d to appease the Greens, who propose quadrupling the refugee intake.   Related: When Peter Dutton insults refugees he insults the Australian people | Lenore Taylor    \u201cOf course they have given no thought to what it\u2019s going to cost or how you\u2019re going to integrate those people,\u201d he said in Sydney on Thursday. \u201cWe are committed to multicultural Australia. We are committed to an immigrant nation, which is what we are.  \u201cWhat Labor is proposing is just political. Bill Shorten is only interested in the politics of this issue. And you can see the way he leapt on it yesterday to demonise Peter Dutton as a means of distracting attention from [David] Feeney\u2019s rather careless accounting for his real estate interests.\u201d At a doorstop on Thursday Shorten responded: \u201cPeople in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones, should they. \u201cThe issue is that yesterday migrants were demonised by Peter Dutton and Malcolm Turnbull backed in Peter Dutton over the great immigration history of this country. \u201cWe know why they\u2019re talking about this every day. We understand why they\u2019re doing it.  \u201cWhat they want to do is say that Labor doesn\u2019t have a strong policy to stop boats coming to Australia and they want to undermine the perception of our commitment to regional processing. They are lying.\u201d Shorten accused the government of running \u201ca cry of xenophobia ... to undermine the migrant contribution to Australia\u201d.  \u201cWe won\u2019t let them get away with their lies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will stand up to their bullying on behalf of a great migrant tradition in this country and we will make sure the election is fought on the issues which matter to everyday Australians.\u201d Shorten said Labor\u2019s policy to increase the humanitarian intake to 27,000 by 2025 had been costed, and the Greens by contrast were \u201cpromising everything to everybody\u201d. Dutton\u2019s comments were condemned by refugee organisations.  The Edmund Rice Centre\u2019s director and president of the Refugee Council, Phil Glendenning, said Dutton\u2019s comments were \u201ca blatant attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator of society \u2013 prejudice and bigotry\u201d. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre\u2019s refugee rights advocate, Pamela Curr, said they were \u201cignorant and ill-informed\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s a sad indictment on [Dutton\u2019s] management of portfolio that he knows so little about people he is responsible for.\u201d On Wednesday Turnbull defended Dutton, describing him as an outstanding immigration minister. Turnbull repeated Dutton\u2019s observation that \u201cmany [refugees], large percentages of them have no English skills at all ... [Many] are illiterate in their own language,\u201d and added: \u201cMany haven\u2019t completed high school. That is no fault of theirs.\u201d Asked about Dutton\u2019s statement refugees took Australian jobs, Turnbull said: \u201cEverybody that comes to Australia, we want to be able to seek employment. We want to be sure that they have got the skills to do so. \u201cWe want them to become part of our workforce.\u201d",
