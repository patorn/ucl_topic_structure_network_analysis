  "body": "The arrival of 10,000 supporters for his unveiling provided Brendan Rodgers with all the evidence he required that swapping the Premier League for Scotland does not automatically constitute a massive fall from grace. On his maiden appearance as the Celtic manager, Rodgers claimed those who are sceptical about his first job since leaving Liverpool in October are unaware of the Scottish champions\u2019 scale. \u201cPeople might say this is a step down but they don\u2019t know this club,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI have come into a huge club here. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have had a number of guys who have said: \u2018Don\u2019t go. Why would you go?\u2019 But this is Celtic and it\u2019s different. It is a challenge, of course. It is a different market, a different budget but this can be a wonderful opportunity to come and help the players. If I can help the game in Scotland then great, but this is about helping Celtic.

On the Monday, I got a call from a club but I wanted to have time out from the intensity of managing big clubs and the pressures that come with it. It was always clear that I wanted to go back in the summer. \u201cWith Swansea, it was a case of me telling Huw Jenkins in January that I wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to work but in the summer I would be. We had a few conversations and a lot of it was linked to the new ownership. That new ownership isn\u2019t ready to go through yet. \u201cI could have waited and maybe got another job in the Premier League, but I hope to be managing for another 20-odd years. The chance to manage Celtic might not come again, which is why I felt I wanted to talk and then be here today.\u201d Peter Lawwell, Celtic\u2019s chief executive, insisted last week that the club were not in the market for a quick managerial fix. Rodgers asserted that such thoughts had never entered his head. \u201cWhen you come into any club, you come in for the longer term,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI look at Martin O\u2019Neill, he was here for five years. Neil Lennon was here for four seasons. So you want to bring success to the club and, however long that takes, you want that opportunity. \u201cTime is the big thing you want as a manager, but ultimately you don\u2019t get that. You\u2019ve got to win games and you\u2019ve got to perform. At this moment in time, I\u2019ve got no thoughts of Celtic being a stepping stone and moving back into the Premier League. I don\u2019t want to work in the Premier League for 20 years, hence the reason I came up here. \u201cThis is a wonderful country. It has some top class coaches and managers. You are working in a totally different market at a totally different level. For me, it is a challenge. However long the challenge is, I will be here. You don\u2019t know what the future holds. For me, to come here and manage and be successful \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not going to be for a year, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Rodgers, who is yet to confirm the make-up of his backroom team, said he had not considered a move for Steven Gerrard. The former Liverpool captain is reportedly keen to return to Britain from the United States. On times at Anfield past and present, Rodgers was effusive. \u201cI loved every minute of my time there,\u201d Rodgers, 43, said. \u201cOf course it was tough at Liverpool towards the end. But they have brought in an outstanding manager who will go on and do very well there. He has time to go on and mould the squad how he wants to do it but I have been able to take a step back from it. \u201cThe Premier League and its intensity is huge and the expectation at Liverpool is huge having not won the league for so long and then getting so close. The difficult part of getting so close and then we never really built on that squad but I have been able to stay fit and I feel good. At Liverpool I just think that I will always remember the positives from there which was that we made the supporters smile, we went as close an anyone to winning the title and we played a brand of football that excited people and the supporters loved. With a little bit more luck we could have won the title.\u201d",
