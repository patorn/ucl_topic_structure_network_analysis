  "body": "In days of yore (yes, yes \u2013 some time in the mid-cretaceous era) I used to be the secretary on the Sun showbiz desk. Shortly after I started, it was explained to me that there were really only 10 tabloid showbiz stories. These include \u201cis set to wed\u201d, \u201cis set to split from\u201d, and \u201chas splashed out on a new\u201d. The best that can be said about one type of tale on the list \u2013 \u201cis set to become a Hollywood movie\u201d \u2013 is that it is probably the one least likely to come true.   Related: David Squires on \u2026 Leicester City winning the Premier League    There are various reasons for this. They range from the fact that a tiny percentage of movies \u201cin development\u201d ever make it to the screen, to the far greater probability that the tale was only filed because the hack had nothing in the cupboard as a Sunday-for-Monday story. And, despite being a blatant invention, it is not the sort of one likely to elicit a legal complaint. Nobody minds being linked with a Hollywood movie, do they? Some, it must be said, can take it or leave it. \u201cIf that\u2019s what they want to do, then so be it,\u201d the Leicester striker Jamie Vardy laughed back in November about reported plans to turn his story into the proverbial Hollywood movie. By February, Adrian Butchart \u2013 the screenwriter in question \u2013 had watched Leicester\u2019s 2-0 win over Liverpool in Vardy\u2019s private box, and posed for a group photo with his girlfriend and agent. Now that the Foxes have only gone and done it, Adrian\u2019s project is reported to be gathering pace. \u201cWhile the central character in the film is Jamie Vardy,\u201d he tells the Daily Mirror, \u201cwhat has happened over the past couple of weeks, when we saw the other Leicester players come together as a team in his absence and prove that they have what it takes to win, has really brought them to the forefront.\u201d Butchart is sweetly described as a \u201cmovie guru\u201d by the Daily Mirror, and crucial to this gurudom appears to be a particularly ruthless form of asceticism. His IMDb entry suggests he has not written a movie for nearly 10 years, when he gave us Goal II: Living the Dream. Two years prior to that was Goal! \u2013 and that is almost it. A rifle through my esteemed colleague Peter Bradshaw\u2019s archives finds he opened his review of Goal! with the stark observation: \u201cThe word \u2018own\u2019 is missing from the title of this cameo-packed football film.\u201d An intro which somehow recalls the two-word review of Spinal Tap\u2019s comeback album Shark Sandwich (which, you will recall, read merely: \u201cShit sandwich.\u201d) So, Leicester may well be hoping for the phenomenon of \u201crival productions\u201d, recently explored by Mark Kermode. As for what will happen to the spellbinding Leicester story once it has been through the wringer of the Hollywood system, I can hardly bear to think. My personal favourite rendering of the movie process is in Robert Altman\u2019s The Player, where our first sight of Richard E Grant is as a profoundly earnest movie director pitching his integrity-heavy death row picture. \u201cNo stars, no pat happy endings,\u201d he insists. There will be no eleventh-hour reprieve of the wrongly convicted murderess: \u201cBecause \u2026 That\u2019s. The reality. The innocent die.\u201d By the time we get to the first screening of the final cut, we see a last-second pardon being phoned through, before the window of the prison gas chamber is shot out by Bruce Willis, who leaps in to free the condemned woman. As he carries her out in his arms, Julia Roberts asks: \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Bruce smiles. \u201cThe traffic was a bitch.\u201d Long before we arrive at this kind of creative compromise with the Leicester project, of course, we can rely on passing certain milestones. First one? Vinnie Jones will be linked with it. Sources close to Vinnie Jones \u2013 player-manager of Brits In LA For No Good Reason \u2013 will tell a journalist that the footballer turned straight-to-GIF star is in talks to star in the Leicester movie. And yet, even as I typed those words, I thought it wise to Google \u2026 and there it was. \u201cFormer football hardman Vinnie Jones is set to be approached to play the part of former Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson in the upcoming Jamie Vardy biopic.\u201d   Related: From Algeria to Thailand: how the world has fallen in love with Leicester City    Well, he\u2019s not the only one. One Direction\u2019s Louis Tomlinson is \u201crumoured\u201d to be in line to play Vardy, which has already produced some artistic niggle. Kasabian, whose guitarist Serge Pizzorno supports Leicester, are interested in doing the movie soundtrack, though not entranced by the possibility of Tomlinson\u2019s casting. Others to be linked with the movie include Emilia Clarke, whose line-mangling in Game of Thrones is \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 irrelevant considering the rest of her performance, but may be more painfully foregrounded in the role of Khal Vardy\u2019s girlfriend. As for what will be left on the cutting room floor, aside from a casino scene, I can only picture an American studio executive screaming: \u201cThe hell is this Stamford Bridge bullshit? I am not paying tens of millions of dollars for my money shot to happen a hundred miles away in London! Do you think Casablanca would have been better if Rick hadn\u2019t said goodbye to Ilsa so we could all watch some scene nobody cares about in Czechoslovakia? Read my lips: the grand final in the Premier League series is held at King Power and that\u2019s non-negotiable. If you don\u2019t like it, get back to Britain and get on your knees for the Lottery.\u201d And so on. I realise that \u201ca Hollywood movie\u201d is still regarded by many as the highest honour contemporary culture can bestow. But I can\u2019t help hoping that the Leicester movie remains safely locked in development hell in perpetuity. The real life story is electrifying \u2013 a fictional version would have \u201cGary Barlow investment vehicle\u201d written all over it.",
