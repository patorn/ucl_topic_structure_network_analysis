But truth is very important in friendships and if we are to be \u201cfriends\u201d for the time it takes you to read this article then it\u2019s important I tell you how it is. If you think this is too abrasive, that\u2019s the first reason, right there, you probably don\u2019t have any friends: you can\u2019t handle the truth and lack self-awareness.   Related: Is it just me... or does everyone lose friends in their 30s?    The second reason may be due to your age. If you are very young, well, you\u2019re probably not reading this. But in childhood we tend to look for friends who live close by and with whom we have common interests. So if you don\u2019t have any friends you may simply not have anyone you can pal up with yet. That\u2019s OK, although it probably doesn\u2019t feel like it. I spent all of my school life on the peripheries of other people\u2019s friendships. Those with \u201cbest friends\u201d seemed impossibly protected. If only I\u2019d known then that not shackling myself to any one friend could, and would, actually make me better at friendships later in life. If you move around frequently as a child (or as an adult), you can either become very, very good at making friends (having to fit in fast, always having to play everyone else\u2019s games) or very, very bad, because you simply get fed up with not being able to put down roots. In adolescence, trust and loyalty become very important. It can be difficult if you don\u2019t find anyone who is a kindred spirit, and it can seem as if everyone is more popular than you. As anyone who has ever befriended a teenager on Facebook will know (Facebook is dead to the young, of course, but a few still use it), they have literally thousands of \u201cfriends\u201d but not necessarily many real friends.           Video: My Bright Idea: Robin Dunbar    The evolutionary anthropologist and author of How Many Friends Does One Person Need?, Robin Dunbar, has come up with the maximum number of friends any one person can meaningfully sustain. That number, aka the Dunbar Number, is 150. \u201cWe\u2019re members of the primate family,\u201d Dunbar has explained, \u201cand within the primates there is a general relationship between the size of the brain and the size of the social group. We fit in a pattern. There are social circles beyond it and layers within \u2013 but there is a natural grouping of 150. This is the number of people you can have a relationship with involving trust and obligation \u2013 there\u2019s some personal history, not just names and faces.\u201d When you are old, you might not have any or many friends because they have moved on, either physically or because, well, they\u2019ve died. I\u2019m writing this in a fairly brusque way because it scares me. When I was 22, my octogenarian neighbour said the worst thing about being old for him was not fear of death but all his friends dying. I had no idea what he was talking about. Your friends didn\u2019t die, they were always with you, weren\u2019t they? Now, two decades and unfortunately some deaths down the line, I\u2019m beginning to see how scary the landscape must be when your friendship base, as well as your hair, starts to thin out.   Related: Good friends are hard to find \u2013 and even harder to keep | Tim Lott    In a letter to the New York Times in March, in response to an article about female friendships, a reader called Enid W Rothenberg described how friendships change as you get older. \u201cFor the very old, the relationships change markedly \u2026 those of us over 85 have to learn to make new friends when we have less to offer and more to lose in a new relationship. Are we being welcomed because we still drive or have the energy to serve wine in the afternoon?\u201d If you\u2019re neither too young nor too old, and you don\u2019t have any friends, you may simply be too critical or negative. If you leave people feeling bad about themselves, or so drained it\u2019s like they\u2019ve given a pint of blood (but without the biscuit afterwards) then they might not want to see you again. In How to Win Friends and Influence People, first published in 1953 and still in publication (16 million copies sold!), the author, Dale Carnegie, recommends not being critical if you want to make friends. \u201cCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is danger, because it wounds a person\u2019s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance and arouses resentment \u2026 by criticising we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.\u201d So although honesty is a vital basis for friendship, diplomacy also needs to be deployed. If you think truth is vital at all costs, at all times, well, count up how many friends you have. (There is a reason my first paragraph rankled so much.)     \u2018Although honesty is a vital basis for friendship, diplomacy also needs to be deployed.\u2019 Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis as Thelma and Louise. Photograph: c.MGM/Everett/Rex Features    All of this said, slating other people can cement a friendship. So maybe you are not mean enough (this friendship malarkey isn\u2019t easy). Ten years ago there was a report published in the journal Personal Relationships called Interpersonal Chemistry Through Negativity: Bonding By Sharing Negative Attitudes About Others. One of the article\u2019s authors, social psychologist Jennifer Bosson, explained that it\u2019s not that we \u201cenjoy disliking people, it\u2019s that we enjoy meeting people who dislike the same people\u201d. Bosson\u2019s advice was to keep talking until you find something about someone that you both dislike. Or, as Alice Roosevelt Longworth put it more succinctly: \u201cIf you can\u2019t find anything good to say about anyone, come sit next to me.\u201d If you don\u2019t have any friends, you could also be male \u2013 I hate to be gender-specific, but men are less likely to have friends. Some years ago there was a four-year study, conducted by the University of Manchester\u2019s School of Social Sciences, which tracked 11,000 men and women. It found that women made \u201cdeeper and more moral\u201d friends who stuck by them, whereas men\u2019s friendships were more likely to be fickle and based on social drinking or playing sport.     \u2018Men\u2019s friendships are often based on playing sport.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy    Ultimately, old or young, male or female, friendships take lots and lots of work to maintain. They don\u2019t just happen. Remembering people\u2019s birthdays. Checking how they are. Listening as well as talking, being interested and au courant in what they\u2019re up to. Lack of friends can be a result of reading signals incorrectly. Many people think other people don\u2019t like them, so they don\u2019t like them in return and thus it goes on and on and before you know it, you hate that person, before you\u2019ve even spoken to them. What I\u2019m about to say sounds tremendously trite, like something you\u2019d find printed on a tea towel in a seaside shop selling awful scented candles, but smiling at someone can be the first step to friendship. It can make someone warm to you, make them like you, because they think you like them. Friendship favours the brave. Those who aren\u2019t afraid to smile or put a hand out first.",
