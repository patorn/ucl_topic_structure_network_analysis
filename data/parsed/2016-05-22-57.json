  "body": "People who are caught sharing new psychoactive substances (NPSs) with friends are unlikely to face prosecution under the ban that comes into force next week, the police commander in charge of implementing the law has said. Commander Simon Bray, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council\u2019s lead on NPSs, said: \u201cThere are all sorts of options around problem-solving in a proportionate way, so the ban is not too heavy-handed on the more social end.\u201d On the other hand, he expected overt sales of the drugs \u2013 also known as legal highs \u2013 to end quite literally overnight, with a significant impact on the high street businesses that stock them. Bray said: \u201cHead shops are not always exclusively NPS, of course. Some are going to be selling other stuff so some may continue trading. But those which have built their business around psychoactive substances will reduce in number or cease to be.\u201d  However, with NPSs still flooding into the country, indications are that it may take some time for the current supply to be exhausted. And some retailers are apparently moving towards less visible markets.

We always thought there would be some element of stockpiling amongst people who want to use these items and a bit of a fire sale towards the end.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen an awful lot of that but there has been some and there has been some move from the clearnet on to the dark web. If you look at some of the retailers, you will see some of them have moved into bitcoin as well as sterling, which suggests they might be heading that way.\u201d The Psychoactive Substances Act, a ban on the trade in any substance that can stimulate or depress a person\u2019s nervous system, is due to come into force on 26 May. Substances including caffeine, nicotine and alcohol are excluded. While possession of psychoactive substances will not be a crime, those convicted of dealing or possession with intent to supply could face a potential seven years in jail. However, Bray said that police had a wide discretion over how they chose to deal with those caught breaking the law.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always got discretion about whether to prosecute or not to prosecute,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s one of the reasons right from the outset that the government have included the notices section.  \u201cThe notices bit is quite wide \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have a sanction attached to it per se \u2013 but it\u2019s a notice that can say to someone: \u2018You mustn\u2019t do this under these circumstances that we\u2019ve set out for x amount of time.\u2019 And it\u2019s pretty open-ended in most cases.\u201d NPSs first appeared in the UK a decade ago as \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d with similar effects to banned drugs but sufficiently different at a molecular level to dodge the Misuse of Drugs Act.  The first big scare emerged around mephedrone, a chemical that mimicked the euphoric and stimulant effect of ecstasy, which was banned in 2010. But the rapid proliferation of the chemicals reached a point where legislators were unable to keep up, prompting a catch-all ban.  Bray said he expected the law to stop some NPS users who experimented with the drugs because they were more freely available than banned equivalents. However, he admitted that many NPS users were already users of controlled drugs who might turn to alternative suppliers once the ban came in.  He said: \u201cThis [ban] will get rid of some of the public manifestations of supply: shops, glossy packets, internet supplies. It will also mean that where our intelligence identified other forms of supply \u2013 whereas in the past we\u2019ve been a bit hamstrung \u2013 now we can say actually it\u2019s a problem we\u2019ve got and some legislation that can solve it.\u201d But Steve Rolles, a senior policy analyst with the Transform Drugs Policy Foundation, which campaigns for drug law reform, said the ban would mask the potential harms of continued NPS use.    Related: Is Irish ban on legal highs driving markets underground?    He said: \u201cThe markets will simply shift to street and unregulated online sales, actually increasing public health risks and crime. Similar bans haven\u2019t worked in Ireland, where use has risen to the highest in Europe, and in Poland, where NPS poisonings have increased. This is about being seen to act \u2013 not evidence of what is going to reduce harms.  \u201cWe welcome the police acknowledging that criminalising young people for possession and non-profit social supply of these drugs is counterproductive and should be de-prioritised. But if it\u2019s wrong and unhelpful for NPS, than we should apply that logic to all drugs. Otherwise we will have an inconsistent, arbitrary and unjust two-tiered approach. \u201cThe longer-term solution has to be strictly regulated supply of more established and better understood drugs like cannabis, MDMA and magic mushrooms, which would collapse the NPS market, rather than just driving it underground.\u201d",
