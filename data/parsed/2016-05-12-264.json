It would have consisted of single family homes on curvilinear streets within walking distance of manmade lakes, shopping centres and industry. In short, a 1970s vision of suburbia. One key factor would have made this town different, however. The self-contained, racially integrated community would be planned, developed and managed by black people. Those black foundations would be celebrated in the town\u2019s name: Soul City. The idea was dreamed up by Floyd McKissick: attorney, civil rights activist and force of nature. In January 1969, amid the waning days of US president Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s administration, McKissick strolled into a Washington DC news conference with secretary of agriculture Orville Freeman and announced plans to build Soul City on 5,000 acres of rural land in impoverished Warren County, just over an hour\u2019s drive from Raleigh, North Carolina. That was the easy part. While Johnson supported the effort and pledged government help, McKissick\u2019s real task began five days later when a new president was sworn in: the politically conservative Richard Nixon.

Photograph: Harold Valentine/AP    Having secured the US\u2019s southern states, including North Carolina, in the 1968 presidential election using a decidedly anti-black campaign tactic called the \u201csouthern strategy\u201d, the prospect of Nixon backing $14m-worth (\u00a39.7m) of federal loan guarantees to support the construction of this new town \u2013 built and managed by black people and called, of all things, Soul City \u2013 looked remote. Yet that\u2019s exactly what happened. Construction on this \u201csouthern utopia\u201d began within a few years. And for a while at least, it looked as if McKissick \u2013 an African American who had marched with Martin Luther King in the violent south and successfully sued for admission to the University of North Carolina School of Law \u2013 had prevailed again.  \u201cThe black man has been searching for identity and destiny in the cities,\u201d McKissick said in that 1969 news conference. \u201cHe should be able to find it in the plains of Warren County.\u201d  The rise of soul Soul City came at time when black culture was taking a larger role in the American mainstream. In 1968, a show called Soul! \u2013 conceived as a black version of the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson \u2013 had premiered on New York public television. There were black sitcoms, and soul music began to cross over to the pop charts with frequency. The nationally syndicated dance show Soul Train premiered in 1971. Major cities such as Los Angeles and Atlanta elected black mayors for the first time. Also, in 1971, hair care company Chicago\u2019s Johnson Products became the first minority-owned firm to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Given the context, a black city did not seem out of the realm.     American civil rights activists Martin Luther King, Floyd McKissick and Stokely Carmichael in Canton, Mississippi.

There would be homes and industry surrounded by trees, hills and lakes. Above all, there would be no prejudice, poverty or slums, according to a Soul City brochure. For a black person in the segregated urban ghettos of the north, the message was clear: \u201cCome back home.\u201d Floyd McKissick Jr, son of the Soul City founder and formerly the development\u2019s planning chief, says that company officials visited and made direct appeals to black families in the north \u2013 many of whom had left the south just a generation earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting, we\u2019d give a \u2018dog a pony\u2019 show (a slide presentation) that could be used exactly for that purpose,\u201d McKissick Jr recalls. \u201cPeople living in Harlem and in Newark ... even if they were working hard and making a living, the price of buying a home was unaffordable. And if they did buy something, they weren\u2019t getting much for their money.\u201d Despite its name, Soul City was never intended to be an all-black town, but rather, a multi-racial community built and managed by black people. To tamp down perceptions that he was building a racially exclusive town, the senior McKissick briefly considered changing its name to Open City. Soul City was born under the federal government\u2019s Model Cities programme, which began in 1966. A plank in President Johnson\u2019s anti-poverty efforts, it funded housing, employment, infrastructure and planning. Of the programme\u2019s 14 new developments, Soul City was the only one to be built from scratch, with no pre-existing infrastructure \u2013 and the only one by a black developer.

The project got urban planning assistance from the very school he had sued more than 20 years earlier: the University of North Carolina. \u201cIt had probably looked pretty much the same since the 1700s and 1800s,\u201d McKissick Jr says of the site. \u201cSo you were transforming the land, laying out plans for it.\u201d In a county where slaves toiled in cotton and tobacco plantations barely a century earlier, the planners envisioned a broad Soul City boulevard leading south into the development from nearby Interstate 85. The road would pass Soul City\u2019s executive office complex and the industrial park Soultech 1. After passing a manmade lake, recreational buildings, and a shopping centre (to be developed later), the boulevard would connect to Opportunity Lane \u2013 leading into the residential areas of Soul City. A county-wide high school and bike trails were also planned. Land was set side to grow food. Soul City would have a freight rail spur, new water purification and sewage treatment facilities, and even a fire department. \u201cYou were going to bring to bear, in a rural area, urban types of interactions and economic opportunities,\u201d recalled Eva Clayton, former executive director of the Soul City Foundation, in 1989, as part of the University of North Carolina\u2019s Documenting the American South project. \u201cYou were going to have houses, you were going to have shops, you were possibly going to have the schools.\u201d A new, \u201climited purpose\u201d governance structure was also planned as part of the experiment. This new town government would create the infrastructure, but the operation and law-making capabilities would be left to Warren County. According to McKissick Jr: \u201cIt would have been a very liveable, planned community ... something you\u2019d see in many places throughout America \u2013 but which was very unique for Warren County.\u201d Visionary and bold The new President Nixon supported Soul City \u2013 and on closer examination, it\u2019s not hard to see why. The Republican party still courted black voters now and again, and the business-oriented McKissick, a believer in capitalism and free markets, had become more Republican-like. He had also grown disenchanted with the traditional civil rights movement, the Black Power movement and the Democratic party. By 1972, he was a full-on member of the Republican party who supported Nixon\u2019s re-election. One year after Nixon was returned to power, Soul City \u2013 armed with those $14m loan guarantees that enabled it to raise capital and sell bonds to begin construction \u2013 broke ground in a November 1973 ceremony.

Photograph: James Cheadle/www.unionmag.co.uk    \u201cIt was a very exciting period,\u201d McKissick Jr remembers. \u201cThe governor of the state flew in on a helicopter and spoke.\u201d \u201cOh, it was visionary,\u201d Clayton said in the 1989 interview. \u201cIt was bold.\u201d Gini Richards is one of a team of three filmmakers who are completing a 20-minute documentary on Soul City: \u201cI think a lot of people mentioned the groundbreaking as this wonderful moment because it happened several years into the project,\u201d she says. \u201cUp until that point, it had been such a struggle to get buy-in and funding \u2013 you can\u2019t build it unless you have people; but if you don\u2019t have buildings, nobody is going to come.\u201d After the groundbreaking, Soul City\u2019s first houses went up, along with a water system plant, a health clinic, and the Soultech 1 industrial centre. A few residents from Richmond, Virginia and Newark heeded the call and moved into this revolutionary new development. Constructed at its main entrance on US Highway 1 and Soul City Boulevard was the \u201cSoul City marquee\u201d \u2013 a 20-ft tall, rectangular concrete monument with the town\u2019s name written in a stylish, rounded 1970s font. \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy with our progress at this stage,\u201d said the elder McKissick in 1973.     An aerial view of Soul City in 1975. Photograph: US General Accounting Office    He was tempting fate. Getting the private sector and the necessary homebuyers to come in, sit down and invest was already proving a struggle. Then the project was dealt a heavier blow by the 1974 US oil crisis, which caused the cost of petrol to skyrocket, taking the prices of plastic piping and asphalt with it. \u201cYou\u2019d see 200 or 300% increases in costs almost overnight,\u201d McKissick Jr says. \u201cThat meant you might as well throw the projections out of the window.\u201d After the Watergate scandal had pushed Nixon from office in 1974, and with the project\u2019s finances now skewing, the Raleigh News & Observer newspaper accused the elder McKissick of misspending Soul City\u2019s government funding. Then the state\u2019s US senator Jesse Helms \u2013 a Republican and noted segregationist \u2013 demanded a federal audit of Soul City, bringing the project to a near-standstill. Alleging financial waste and mismanagement, Helms called Soul City \u201can insult to the hard-pressed taxpayers of North Carolina, and the nation\u201d. The probe found no wrongdoing, but the delay further weakened the project\u2019s viability. With 30-year home mortgages rising above 10% in 1978, Soul City was to all intents and purposes finished \u2013 despite the arrival in April of that year of Welmetco, a manufacturer of backpacks and duffel bags.  Amid severe criticism that the project wasn\u2019t progressing, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development finally pulled its funding in 1979. The agency took over Soul City\u2019s ownership the following year and auctioned off the town for $1.5m. McKissick, who sued the department and later settled, kept a few properties under his control. Throughout the 1980s he continued to push the Soul City concept, even after becoming a judge. He died in 1991 aged 69, and was buried in Soul City.

They escaped the harsh boot of Jim Crow to find a better life in the north of the country, reshaping everything from art to politics in the process. In this century, however, the trend is reversing. It is a phenomenon that would have been unthinkable 50 years ago; black people in their tens of thousands are returning to America\u2019s southern states.  And Soul City is still there, unfinished. It\u2019s now part of the city of Manson, North Carolina, with Soultech 1 making up a section of the county\u2019s jail complex. But the streets, the giant Soul City sign, and other reminders of those heady days are still there. Portions of the area resemble a ghost town, rotting \u2013 or perhaps waiting. Could Soul City ever be resurrected? \u201cI could see it occurring,\u201d says McKissick Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of whether it\u2019s in this decade or the next, or if it takes longer. If Soul City could all be reassembled, it could have great potential.\u201d Does your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development?
