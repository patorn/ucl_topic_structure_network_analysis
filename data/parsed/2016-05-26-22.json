  "body": "The last time England played Australia, in February 2003, the occasion was memorable for the debut of a freckle-faced Liverpudlian who has not done too badly for his country since cadging a lift from his Uncle Eugene to the team hotel and managing to fall asleep when he should have been downstairs for his first get-together. Wayne Rooney\u2019s first impressions of the England squad, once someone had \u201cfetched a spare key from reception, opened my bedroom door then shaken me awake\u201d, was that it was a cliquey world \u2013 \u201cManchester United\u2019s players sitting together and the Liverpool players on another table\u201d \u2013 where the standard of training was better than anything he had ever been used to at Everton. England were trailing 2-0 when he came on as a half-time substitute. Rooney set up the goal for Francis Jeffers, another debutant, but England lost 3-1, ignominiously, and the night was notable for an unusual occurrence: Sven Goran Eriksson losing his temper. \u201cSven was understandably angry,\u201d Rooney recalls.   Related: Marcus Rashford in line to make England debut against Australia    Thirteen years on it is now Marcus Rashford\u2019s turn as the new kid on the block. Rooney, now the elder statesman of England\u2019s squad, had the impudence to chip David James in one of his first training sessions and Everton\u2019s boy wonder was already on his way to international stardom by the time \u2013 with a 12-year-old Jordan Henderson one of the ball-boys \u2013 England played Turkey not long afterwards on their last visit to Sunderland. Rashford has taken a similar path so far but, if anything, the teenager from Wythenshawe, on the edge of Manchester, will be under even more pressure bearing in mind the backdrop to his first England appearance will be that Roy Hodgson has to finalise his Euro 2016 squad before Tuesday\u2019s midnight deadline. Rashford, in other words, will get only one chance in England\u2019s colours to show he belongs at this level and the pressure is considerable. \u201cI, my coaching staff, the rest of the players and the whole of the English football world will be watching,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cEveryone will be saying: \u2018We all think this lad has something special, can he now show it again?\u2019 \u201cWe appreciate his pace. We appreciate his directness. We appreciate his desire to get behind defences with or without ball. Just take the FA Cup final as the most recent example. He plays with a confidence in his own ability. He has important qualities for our style of play.

But we\u2019ll see.\u201d It is certainly a lot to ask of a player who started the season in Manchester United\u2019s under-18s, does not turn 19 until Halloween and played in front of 3,264 people on his last international appearance \u2013 a 2-1 defeat against Canada for England\u2019s under-20s at the Keepmoat Stadium, Doncaster. Rashford is 16 months older than Rooney when the boy from Merseyside became England\u2019s youngest player, at the age of 17 years and 111 days. Yet, in another sense, he is actually ahead of Rooney in terms of the speed at which everything has happened. Rashford\u2019s first cap will arrive only 92 days after he made his first-team debut at Old Trafford, and with only 18 first-team appearances to his name, whereas Rooney went 179 days from breaking into the Everton side to playing for England and had been involved in 26 games for his club. It is also worth keeping in mind that Gareth Southgate, England\u2019s under-21s\u2019 manager, left Rashford out of his last squad because it was considered \u201ca bit early for him exposure-wise\u201d. That decision looks increasingly bizarre and, listening to Hodgson at England\u2019s team hotel, nobody should automatically presume Rashford will be cut free when the squad is whittled down to 23 players in the coming days.

I wanted to play down all those expectations and demands and at least give him a chance to see if he could keep it up for two or three months and, in fairness to him, that\u2019s what he has done.\u201d There is certainly no doubt who will be the centre of attention when England play their penultimate warm-up game and, though Hodgson would not rule out Daniel Sturridge\u2019s chances of playing, it seems inconceivable that the Liverpool striker will be risked when his troublesome calf has flared up again. The stage is set for Rashford. \u201cHe has very interesting qualities, so can he produce them at international level at such a young age?\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cNow we will find out.\u201d",
