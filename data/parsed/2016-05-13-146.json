The international charity said the last remaining open road out of Khan Eshieh, a Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus, was shut this week by heavy shelling and sniper fire. Save the Children said three youths were reportedly shot dead trying to escape the camp, while bombing has increased, with dozens of barrel bombs being dropped on the area.   Related: Red Cross aid convoy denied entry to Syrian city of Darayya     News of the siege emerged as an aid convoy carrying medicine, vaccines and baby milk to Darayya \u2013 a suburb of Damascus that has been under siege for more than three years \u2013 was prevented from entering the town by elite troops loyal to the president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s brother, Maher, even though the Syrian government had agreed to the deal. There are more than a million people living under siege in Syria, the vast majority in blockades orchestrated by the Assad government. The blocking of the aid deliveries has raised further questions about the Syrian government\u2019s commitment to allowing aid into besieged areas.   Sonia Khush, head of Save the Children\u2019s Syria programme, said that despite the \u201csupposed ceasefire\u201d people across the country were still suffering sieges and bombardments. \u201cPeople in Khan Eshieh tell us that most medicine, fuel and flour has almost run out, and food prices have doubled in the past few days,\u201d she said.  \u201cThey expect it to get even worse in the coming days. The roads and access to the camp must urgently be reopened and vital humanitarian aid immediately allowed in.\u201d On Thursday a joint UN, Red Cross and Red Crescent mission to Darayya turned back after seven hours of negotiations at the final checkpoint before the town, where they faced unexpected hurdles, despite agreeing not to include food in the convoy, and appealing to the UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, and the Russian government. The troops from the 4th Armoured Brigade, which is led by Maher al-Assad, prevented the convoy\u2019s entry until the mission was aborted.  They then fired shells at the crowd that had gathered in the town centre to receive the aid, killing two people and wounding five civilians, the Southern Front, an opposition coalition that controls the town, said in a statement. \u201cCommunities in Darayya are in need of everything, and it\u2019s tragic that even the basics we were bringing today are being delayed unnecessarily. We must be able to provide aid impartially and safely,\u201d said Marianne Gasser, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria (ICRC).  \u201cThere must be minimum conditions for independent humanitarian action in Syria. Today those conditions were not met. We urge the responsible parties to grant us this access immediately.\u201d  The UK international development secretary, Justine Greening, said the Syrian authorities\u2019 refusal to let the convoy into Darayya was shocking. \u201cFor nearly four years, Darayya has been besieged, cut off from humanitarian assistance in any form,\u201d she said. \u201cAccess to medical treatment is not a privilege it is a fundamental right. Immediate and sustained humanitarian access to reach all people in need in Syria must be a priority. It should not be subject to negotiation.\u201d Darayya was surrounded by government troops in November 2012, and since then no aid deliveries to the town have been permitted.    Related: Syria's Darayya needs air drops to save its people from starvation | Glenys Kinnock    Human rights workers say people in Darayya are short on essentials like food, medicine and baby milk. Some people there are malnourished. The ICRC has been granted access in the past to deliver life-saving aid to towns like Madaya, where residents were starving and reduced to eating grass and cooked tree leaves to survive. Despite the neutrality of the Red Cross \u2013 and the organisation\u2019s agreement to the government\u2019s conditions to deliver the material to Darayya without food as a confidence-building measure \u2013 the regime\u2019s refusal to permit entry highlighted the politicisation of aid deliveries in Syria. Maher was seen as a key figure in the immediate crackdown on protesters when the uprising in Syria began in 2011, an uncompromising character who sought to use maximum force against demonstrators.",
