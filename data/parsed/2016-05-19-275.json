  "body": "Hi Wayne, how are you doing? I\u2019m good, thank you Small Talk. How are you? We\u2019re fine, Wayne, and very excited about the Betway Premier League Play-Offs. Who\u2019s going to win? I still think Michael van Gerwen is the one to beat, but I\u2019m one of these people who loves a bit of fantasy \u2013 and I would love it if people were saying: \u201cWow, how did Phil Taylor come back to do that?\u201d That would sum Phil Taylor up. If he wins, he should pick the trophy up and say to everyone, \u201cRight, you said I was finished and you were wrong. See you later.\u201d Don\u2019t you think the prospect of winning the worlds again will be too tempting, even if he wins this? I do. But lose the worlds and then what? He\u2019s got more chance of winning the Premier League than he has the world championship \u2013 he\u2019s in the play-offs, so he\u2019s only got two games to win now. I would hate to see him become one of these chasers. He\u2019s not like Steve Davis, who could miss events and come back and say, \u201cLook I don\u2019t care, I just want to compete, I know I won\u2019t win but I enjoy it.\u201d Phil Taylor could not turn up at an event to be beaten. It doesn\u2019t work that way with Phil.  When he lost to Jelle Klaasen in the last 16 of the worlds in December, many thought it was over, but his Premier League form has been brilliant. What has changed? He\u2019d been changing his equipment. I\u2019m closely in with Target Darts, and they have made a dart that he loves. He has said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure this can be improved upon.\u201d He\u2019s happy with his equipment. It\u2019s like he has thought, \u201cThe excuses have stopped. It\u2019s now me, I have to perform.\u201d And he really is.   Related: Adrian Lewis v Gary Anderson: PDC World Darts Championship final \u2013 in pictures    Is he the mentally toughest sportsman you\u2019ve ever seen? Have I ever seen anyone stronger? No, probably not. I see him in action and look at him wondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What is going on in there?\u201d When one human being can\u2019t read another, they\u2019ve definitely got something you haven\u2019t. In your book Hawaii 501, there were two recurring themes: a love of KFC and a fascination with the mental side of darts. Is that what makes it so good? I think it is. It\u2019s one-on-one: you miss a shot, someone takes out something miraculous, and the whole world changes. It shouldn\u2019t. The great players, they don\u2019t allow it to change; they stay in control. Those that allow certain shots to faze them on a regular basis are mentally weaker than those at the top. Can you believe the standard of play these days? No. It\u2019s outrageous. I remember playing in the 2008 Premier League, and I averaged 97 over a seven-game spell. I thought: \u201cThis is brilliant, I do not get any better than this.\u201d I vividly remember being on stage, being annihilated by Phil, thinking, \u201cI am glad there\u2019s only one Phil Taylor, nobody will ever average what he does.\u201d And now Michael van Gerwen is better. The stats don\u2019t lie. If you could relive one game from your career, what would it be? Small Talk thinks it knows the answer \u2026 Yeah, it would be the game against Phil at the World Championship in 2008.             You won 5-4 but you were confident even at 3-0 down, weren\u2019t you? There\u2019s actually someone to back up my confidence! There was a guy, Scott Gibling, who was one of the match officials for the PDC. I went off for a break and I was standing there, bewildered, and then I said, \u201cDo you know what, Scott? I\u2019ve had enough. I have had enough of this. Here we go.\u201d He looked at me like I was some kind of lunatic. Within seconds I found an inner strength and a confidence \u2013 I just thought, \u201cStop playing Phil Taylor and just have a bit of fun.\u201d That attitude made me freer, more competitive, and I think it worried Phil because he got worse and worse as the match went on. The feeling of that last leg, I\u2019d like to relive that again. That was beautiful. So you almost chose to enter the zone? I didn\u2019t predict it, but I felt it could happen. Normally as human beings we are quite weak - but I didn\u2019t feel weak, even though I was behind and getting absolutely annihilated. I felt I had a lot more to offer, and for the next hour or so I did. Unfortunately the next day was... (starts laughing) \u2026 poor. Would it have helped in the semi-final against Kirk Shepherd if you\u2019d had an extra day off? I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d have become world champion but I needed a day off. I said that before I played. I didn\u2019t feel as in control as I did the day before. And I\u2019d already lost in three world semi-finals. It was a bigger semi-final for me than it would be for others. It\u2019ll be like that the next time James Wade is in the semis. He\u2019s never reached the final and he\u2019s lost three, so don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s just another semi-final. It\u2019s not. It becomes tougher. So, yeah, I could have done with another 12 hours\u2019 sleep. Never mind! Although he won it in 2014, is there a danger something similar could happen with Michael van Gerwen? Yes. I thought it was an issue this year, I really did. He did nothing wrong, he averaged 105 against Barney. But to win everything on TV apart from the Premier League and the worlds, that would really have bothered him. It will only be worse next year. Can\u2019t be any better. Since 2012 he\u2019s been the best player on the planet but he\u2019s won only one world title. I think he needs to win it this year. That Kirk Shepherd semi-final, is that the one that got away? Nah. The one I think about the most was 2006, when I lost to Phil in the semi-finals. I had him. I had him. I was the better player \u2026 People will laugh at this, but I know and Phil knows: I was the best player in the tournament that year. I felt I blew it. \u201cAh, man, what have you done?\u201d I remember missing double nine to lead 5-3, and once I missed that he changed \u2026 (starts laughing) \u2026 and I didn\u2019t like it. You do a bit of darts coaching . Are you surprised the top players don\u2019t have coaches, like in tennis? I\u2019m not surprised, I\u2019m absolutely gobsmacked. I\u2019m not on about employing me, but I\u2018m amazed they don\u2019t employ someone. How can a sport where there\u2019s millions of pounds on the line not have coaching at the top level or any level? It\u2019s incredible. There was a good example at the World Championships, when James Wade was playing Gary Anderson in the quarter-finals. James was lifting his left heel off the floor as he was throwing. That meant his darts were spraying all over the 20. Eric Bristow was doing coaching with him at the time, but it was more mental than technical. I said in commentary, \u201cEric Bristow needs to get James Wade in the break and tell him what he\u2019s doing wrong here.\u201d Eric didn\u2019t have a word with him \u2026 sorry about that, my dog\u2019s going nuts \u2026 Eric wasn\u2019t interested in the technical side, but darts is such a technical sport. If you\u2019re moving as you\u2019re throwing, it has to affect your accuracy. Who\u2019s the next superstar of darts? Before the Premier League I would have said Michael Smith, but he didn\u2019t cope well at all. I felt for him in the first week, when he had to play two games. He was as nervous as kitten. Being eliminated might have done him a favour. I think he\u2019ll be around for a long time, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s the next superstar. There are a few guys who have got a lot to offer: Max Hopp, he\u2019s a great young player, he\u2019s got a fantastic action. Josh Payne is a really good player, who has just won his first ProTour event. He\u2019s got a look and a way of living that I think darts needs. What about Benito Van de Pas? I think he\u2019s great but I\u2019m unconvinced by his longevity because of the way he throws. It\u2019s an odd action and the minute the timing goes he becomes poor. On his day he\u2019s a world-beater. You\u2019re a Spurs fan. Is this the best Spurs team you\u2019ve ever seen? No. No. I did like the Mark Falco era \u2026 The Mark Falco era?! Yeah I liked the team in the early 1980s \u2013 Gary Mabbutt, Glenn Hoddle, Steve Archibald. I loved watching them. I do think this is one of the worst Premier Leagues I\u2019ve ever seen. The standard is shocking. What was the last film you saw? Birdman, with Michael Keaton. It was 93 minutes of my life I\u2019ll never get back! What\u2019s your poison? It would be \u2013 especially in the summer \u2013 a nice bottle of Corona with a small wedge of lime in the top. You\u2019re not one for this whole craft beer revolution then? No. No. I\u2019m 43 but I\u2019m kind of old school \u2013 I know a bottle of Corona with lime in the top isn\u2019t old school, but I like a beer that I know isn\u2019t going to get me too drunk. I have my very small limits. Do you have a pair of slippers? Yes. They\u2019re Uggs, these fluffy Ugg things, but they don\u2019t make your feet warm at all. I was bought them for my 40th birthday by my sister \u2013 and I\u2019ve got them on now! What\u2019s your favourite TV show? My favourite TV show, without any hesitation, is The Big Bang Theory. And after that it would be The Blacklist. It\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019ve just started watching the, er, Break \u2026 what\u2019s it called? Oh how can you forget. I\u2019ve just watched seven episodes in two days \u2026 a guy with lung cancer is go \u2026 Oh, Breaking Bad Breaking Bad, that\u2019s it. Yeah, it\u2019s excellent. Wait till you meet Gus Fring in season three. Right, OK, ssssshhhhh. Who would you invite to a fantasy dinner party? Wow. Er. Oh. There aren\u2019t many people I find intriguing, believe it or not. One of them would be John McEnroe. I just like the fact he didn\u2019t care. Why should he? Why should he care? My mind just revolves around sport, it\u2019s pretty sad \u2026 (thinks for a bit) I\u2019ll go Elvis. I want to ask him why he felt the need to self-destruct. He had everything, absolutely everything. I can\u2019t think of any others to be honest. It changes I reckon, when you get to 30, 40 and 50. Ask me in 10 years and I probably wouldn\u2019t mention those two. But those two intrigue me because they didn\u2019t conform. I hate conformists. They bore me a bit. Small Talk can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t said Colonel Sanders. Are you still a KFC man. No. We had a bad experience in one! It was horrible. That put us off for about five years. This is shocking news. I have the odd one, where you think, \u201cRight I\u2019ll give KFC the benefit of the doubt.\u201d But no, no, the coating is not the same. Have you found anything else to fill the void? Nando\u2019s? I do like Nando\u2019s, but it\u2019s a meal isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s, \u201cLet\u2019s go shopping and \u2018look, there\u2019s a Nando\u2019s\u2019\u201d But KFC, back in the eighties and nineties, ach! Pure joy! We\u2019re off for a Bargain Bucket. Thanks for your time Wayne. My pleasure Small Talk. Sky Sports will show the Betway Premier League darts Play-Offs on Thursday 19 May at 7pm on Sky Sports 2",
