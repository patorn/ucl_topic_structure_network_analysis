  "body": "Clinton Romesha was pleased when early readers of Red Platoon, his memoir of the 14-hour Battle of Kamdesh, told him the book made it seem like he had done very little during the siege. Book agents had started approaching Romesha three years ago, shortly after Barack Obama awarded him the Medal of Honor, America\u2019s highest military honor. In 2009, the Black Knight Troop was preparing to close a poorly positioned outpost in eastern Afghanistan when it was attacked by 300 Taliban insurgents. Romesha, then a staff sergeant, led the counterattack, which was ultimately victorious although he was wounded and eight troop members were killed.  Romesha was apprehensive about the prospect of courting attention. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do a book about the individual perspective of Clint Romesha,\u201d he says, especially since CNN journalist Jake Tapper had already written a book, titled The Outpost, about Kamdesh. But he knew that many troop members were uncomfortable speaking with journalists, and these members encouraged him to write a first-person account that would tell a fuller story. (The film rights to Red Platoon already have been optioned by Sony Pictures.) \u201cI get the attention on a daily basis, but the other men that were there with me that day were just as important,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for those eight men who gave up everything I wouldn\u2019t be here, but there\u2019s been a one-sided perspective.\u201d With journalist Kevin Fedarko, Romesha went back and spent hours discussing and reliving the battle with his \u201cbattle buddies\u201d. Red Platoon, out this week from Penguin Random House, joins the ranks of war memoirs like Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell and American Sniper by Chris Kyle. Romesha, whose father served two tours in Vietnam, said there has been a rise in such memoirs because direct knowledge of the military is increasingly rare.  \u201cWe live in a time now where less and less are serving, and with that comes a disconnect between those that serve and those that haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the experience is more foreign, there are people out there who want to know what it\u2019s like, and if we as veterans put our candle under a bushel and don\u2019t let other people see our sacrifice it will be forgotten.\u201d     The body of US army specialist Michael Scusa is returned to the US, one of eight American soldiers killed in the battle of Kamdesh. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images    For Romesha, working with Fedarko highlighted the strength of the military bond. \u201cHaving Kevin there to interject and have us fully explain things made us aware of when we\u2019re talking in our military language, made us hear those meaningful pauses or those awkward glances at each other,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about that unspoken language, the words in between the words.\u201d In one instance, Romesha referred to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d when speaking with Lieutenant Andrew Bundermann about their strategy for building up the platoon before heading to Afghanistan. Prompted by Fedarko to explain the term \u2013 which means talking up a soldier to exchange him for another one \u2013 Romesha realised that there is so much unsaid that goes on between military people that outsiders cannot understand. \u201cServing in the military and being able to have that as part of my life is something that I can never explain in terms of how much that means to me and how that has really developed me into the man that I am today,\u201d he says. Romesha doesn\u2019t read many war memoirs himself. While overseas, he was more interested in presidential memoirs and history books than ones about experiences that mirrored his own. He retired from the military in 2011 and now works for the oil industry in North Dakota, but said that the military will always be part of his life.  \u201cNow that I have a little more voice that maybe people will listen to, I hope to have the opportunity to talk about veterans\u2019 rights, the status of our military, why veterans don\u2019t get chiropractic care, why the Veterans\u2019 Administration continues to have these scams,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk for those who can\u2019t really talk or say what\u2019s really on their mind.\u201d",
