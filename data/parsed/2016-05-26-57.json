  "body": "Every reference to Australia was scrubbed from the final version of a major UN report on climate change after the Australian government intervened, objecting that the information could harm tourism. Guardian Australia can reveal the report \u201cWorld Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate\u201d, which Unesco jointly published with the United Nations environment program and the Union of Concerned Scientists on Friday, initially had a key chapter on the Great Barrier Reef, as well as small sections on Kakadu and the Tasmanian forests. But when the Australian Department of Environment saw a draft of the report, it objected, and every mention of Australia was removed by Unesco. Will Steffen, one of the scientific reviewers of the axed section on the reef, said Australia\u2019s move was reminiscent of \u201cthe old Soviet Union\u201d. No sections about any other country were removed from the report. The removals left Australia as the only inhabited continent on the planet with no mentions. Explaining the decision to object to the report, a spokesperson for the environment department told Guardian Australia: \u201cRecent experience in Australia had shown that negative commentary about the status of world heritage properties impacted on tourism.\u201d As a result of climate change combined with weather phenomena, the Great Barrier Reef is in the midst of the worst crisis in recorded history. Unusually warm water has caused 93% of the reefs along the 2,300km site to experience bleaching. In the northern most pristine part, scientists think half the coral might have died. The omission was \u201cfrankly astounding,\u201d Steffen said.

He was previously executive director of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme, where he worked with 50 countries on global change science. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of my career working internationally,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very rare that I would see something like this happening. Perhaps in the old Soviet Union you would see this sort of thing happening, where governments would quash information because they didn\u2019t like it. But not in western democracies. I haven\u2019t seen it happen before.\u201d The news comes less than a year after the Australian government successfully lobbied Unesco to not list the Great Barrier Reef in its list of \u201cWorld Heritage Sites in Danger\u201d. The removals occurred in early 2016, during a period when there was significant pressure on the Australian government in relation to both climate change and world heritage sites. At the time, news of the government\u2019s science research agency CSIRO sacking 100 climate scientists due to government budget cuts had just emerged; parts of the Tasmanian world heritage forests were on fire for the first time in recorded history; and a global coral bleaching event was beginning to hit the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 another event driven by global warming. The environment department spokesperson told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe department was concerned that the framing of the report confused two issues \u2013 the world heritage status of the sites and risks arising from climate change and tourism.\u201d The report said the case studies were chosen partly because of their geographic representation, their importance for tourism and the robustness of evidence around the impact of climate change on them.

Photograph: Rob Blakers for the Guardian    A recent study found the conditions that cause the current bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef was made at least 175 times more likely by climate change and, on the current trajectory, would become the average conditions within 20 years.   Related: Great Barrier Reef: advisers call for cap on farm pollution    Without mentioning the Great Barrier Reef, the report notes: \u201cResearch suggests that preserving more than 10% of the world\u2019s corals would require limiting warming to 1.5C or less, and protecting 50% would mean halting warming at 1.2C (Frieler et al. 2012).\u201d The full statement from the environment department said:   The World Heritage Centre initiated contact with the Department of the Environment in early 2016 for our views on aspects of this report.  The department expressed concern that giving the report the title \u2018Destinations at risk\u2019 had the potential to cause considerable confusion. In particular, the world heritage committee had only six months earlier decided not to include the Great Barrier Reef on the in-danger list and commended Australia for the Reef 2050 Plan. The department was concerned that the framing of the report confused two issues \u2013 the world heritage status of the sites and risks arising from climate change and tourism. It is the world heritage committee, not its secretariat (the World Heritage Centre), which is properly charged with examining the status of world heritage sites. Recent experience in Australia had shown that negative commentary about the status of world heritage properties impacted on tourism. The department indicated it did not support any of Australia\u2019s world heritage properties being included in such a publication for the reasons outlined above. The Department of the Environment conveyed these concerns through Australia\u2019s ambassador to UNESCO. The department did not brief the minister on this issue.\u201d",
