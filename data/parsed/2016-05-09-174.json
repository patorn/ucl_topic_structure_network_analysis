  "body": "A British-Iranian woman is being held in solitary confinement in Iran, away from her two-year-old daughter, after they attempted to return to the UK from a family visit.  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a 37-year-old project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the news agency\u2019s charitable arm, was arrested in early April in Tehran by members of Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guard at Imam Khomeini airport, where she and her daughter, Gabriella, were about to board a flight back to the UK. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has since been separated from Gabriella, who is solely British and does not have Iranian nationality. The child has been placed in the care of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s family in Iran and her passport confiscated. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who has been advised not to travel to Iran, says he has neither seen his daughter since she went holiday, nor spoken to his wife since her arrest. \u201cIt is now nearly two months since I saw or held my little girl. I cannot get her back: her passport is confiscated, I have no visa, and I have been advised not to try and go to Iran,\u201d Ratcliffe said.  It is unclear why the guards arrested Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but the Iranian authorities have deep suspicion of dual-nationals and in recent years have held a number of them on security charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has since been held in solitary confinement in an unknown location in the southern province of Kerman. She has not been allowed access to a lawyer but has informed her family in Iran that she has been under pressure to confess to unspecified crimes. The family has been told that her arrest is connected to a matter of national security.  Her plight is complicated by the fact that Iran does not recognise dual nationality, which means she is not granted consular access to British officials.  Ratcliffe said Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s role at Thomson Reuters Foundation \u2013 which runs media training programmes and some legal services \u2013 was to manage grants, and was unconnected with the news agency\u2019s coverage of Iran.  Reuters has not had a bureau in Iran since 2012 when all staff in the country had their press accreditation suspended due to a mistake in a story about women\u2019s martial arts training.  \u201cIt is hard to understand how a young mother and her small child on holiday could be considered an issue of national security. She has been over to visit her family regularly since making Britain her home,\u201d her husband said in a statement. He has not been able to speak to his wife since the arrest.  \u201cThe cruelty of the situation seems both outrageous and arbitrary \u2013 that a young mum and baby can be treated as some national security threat is absurd, far outside any reality our family was familiar with,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut it is also very real. In its isolation and pressures on her, it is a cruelty that is clearly deliberate and designed. And I have been powerless to stop it. After 36 days we have gone public, against the advice of the [Foreign Office], in the hope that with others and with public pressure that might change.\u201d  A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have been providing support to the family of a British-Iranian national since we were first informed of her arrest, and will continue to do so.\u201d The Foreign Office said it would not comment on a case involving a minor.      Nazanin with daughter Gabriella    Ratcliffe described his wife as \u201ca kind, caring and sociable person, who would do anything for her family\u201d. He said: \u201cIt will be torturing her to be stuck in solitary confinement, away from her baby and all her family, thinking about all the worry that they are going through and whether she will be able to see them again. I have not been able to reach her at all, or speak to her to remind her that she has done nothing wrong. \u201cI am pleading to the British authorities, now that delegations are traveling between the two countries to improve trade and understanding that all efforts are made to bring my wife and daughter home as quickly as possible, and to get Nazanin out of solitary confinement immediately.\u201d      Kamran Foroughi, son of detainee Kamal Foroughi, protests outside the Iranian embassy in London. Photograph: Amnesty International    Zaghari-Ratcliffe was born in Tehran in 1978 and moved to the UK in 2007, where she met Ratcliffe while studying. They married in Winchester in 2009, and five years later Gabriella was born in London.  Other Britons held in Iran include Kamal Foroughi. Last week marked five years since the British-Iranian businessman was imprisoned. There are concerns about the state of his health and his family have repeatedly urged the Iranian authorities to give him access to proper medical care.  \u201cWe can\u2019t believe that my 76-year-old dad has spent five long years in Evin Prison,\u201d Foroughi\u2019s son, Kamran, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand why he hasn\u2019t been released, or why he was arrested in the first place.  \u201cFor the Iranian authorities we have a simple message: please let Grandpa Kamal go and let him come home. He hasn\u2019t seen his wife, daughter, son and two granddaughters for five years, and we\u2019re all suffering too much.\u201d",
