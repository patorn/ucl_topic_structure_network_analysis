  "body": "A British man has died of a heart attack after a fight on the Canary island of Tenerife, an emergency service said. The 53-year-old man was in cardiac arrest when medical staff arrived after receiving several reports that two men were beating each other in the street in the resort of Costa Adeje, on the south-west coast of the island, the Emergencies and Security Coordinating Centre (CECOES) said. A doctor, nurse and police arrived at the scene in Avenida Ernesto Sarti at 1.47am on Thursday but resuscitation attempts failed and the man was pronounced dead. The Spanish national police had taken over the investigation of the incident, CECOES said. Costa Adeje is a relatively new resort area within the town of Adeje. It has benefited from regeneration cash in recent months and brands itself as an \u201cupmarket\u201d alternative to some of the \u201cpie-and-pint\u201d resorts elsewhere on the island.",
