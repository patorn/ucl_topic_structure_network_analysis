  "body": "All aid workers have been there. Stepping off the plane, squinting into unfamiliar light, a freshly signed contract clutched in our jet-lagged hands \u2013 freshly minted aid workers arriving on our first ever mission. Just as at home \u2013 whether you\u2019re national or international staff \u2013 you\u2019re desperate to impress. But forget getting stuck in the lift or spilling coffee down your new shirt, aid environments provide entirely new ways to screw up on your first day. Even when knee-deep in post-typhoon mud, first impressions are everything. So here\u2019s our toolkit for not putting your newly-sandalled foot in your mouth.   Related: The seven  sins of humanitarian douchery    Getting ready to go The eternal question is what to pack? The art of second-guessing what you\u2019ll need in three weeks time takes on a different dimension when, by then, you might be halfway up the Congo river. You need to be extra careful with your baggage allowance. I\u2019d suggest not, for example, panic-buying a child\u2019s mattress, especially one in Barbie doll print, just because you heard en-route to post-tsunami Aceh in Indonesia that colleagues were sleeping on the floor. How my colleagues laughed when they showed me to my room, complete with a bed, in an actual house. All I suffered was piss-taking, unlike my ecoconscious friend who took organic bug repellent to Sierra Leone. \u201cNeedless to say, I was down with malaria within a few weeks,\u201d she remembers. But at least we did some research, unlike the American friend who, deployed to Russia, packed shot glasses. Or another headed for Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo who packed a tin of sweet potatoes. \u201cI always cook Thanksgiving dinner wherever I am,\u201d she says, in her defence. \u201cI was worried about getting the ingredients.\u201d Oh, and one more thing: do actually sign the contract before you leave. Don\u2019t just believe the nice man who tells you over the phone that they\u2019ll sort it when you get to Haiti/Nepal/complete-as-applicable, or you could end up in a crisis zone with no medical insurance, no allowances, a salary half that of your colleagues \u2013 and a six-month fight to rectify it all. Packing clothes   Related: Humanitarian Star Wars: 15 signs your mission belongs in a galaxy far, far away    Wrongly guessing the look at your destination is a classic error and easily done, no matter how hard you try. \u201cTrying to be culturally appropriate my first day in Sudan, I wore what I thought were tasteful billowy clothes for a 50C summer day,\u201d remembers one friend. \u201cThe head of human resources asked me if I was Amish.\u201d On the other hand, blending in too well is also an issue. Another friend recalls landing in a remote area, jumping out of the helicopter, \u201cand realising that, from a distance, my trousers and top looked exactly like the uniform of the militias that had been harassing people in the same area.\u201d Whatever you wear, though, do remember to bring more than one outfit. One friend \u2013 not even a rookie \u2013 was deployed to Aceh after the 2004 tsunami with only one pair of trousers packed. When, after two weeks of constant wear in the heat, he finally got a new pair, his long-suffering colleagues were so relieved they included it in the UN daily situation report, in bright pink, 24-point type. As proofreading was not a top priority at that point in the response, it wasn\u2019t removed and landed up on desks from Downing Street to Canberra. The moral of the story? Ask in advance. And always pack spare trousers. Settling in Once arrived, get settled in. \u201cOn my first night in Kosovo, I had just got into the shower at the hotel when gunshots went off right outside my window,\u201d remembers one colleague. \u201cI turned off the lights, hit the deck, shimmied along the floor to get some clothes and went immediately down to the bar \u2013 where no one else had even noticed \u2026 My introduction to happy fire.\u201d  Guesthouses can also be traps for the unwary. One colleague, who had never seen a generator, confesses: \u201cI had to be told what the \u2018roaring\u2019 sound was.\u201d Another, deployed to Myanmar after cyclone Nargis, came unstuck when she tried to do a little tidying up using some outsized rubbish bags she found. \u201cIt was only when I asked why the binbags were too big that a colleague told me they were actually bodybags,\u201d she remembers. All offices have their quirks, but field stations in particular can be more Heart of Darkness than David Brent and, generally speaking, challenging the boss never ends well. \u201cIn Gabon, in my first two weeks, I sat at the head of the table at the first all-staff meeting without thinking about it. It was the only empty chair left. You could almost hear the gasps, as if I, the only white westerner in the place, was deliberately trying to usurp \u2018Madame\u2019, the resident representative. It was downhill from there.\u201d  Another useful tip: If you\u2019re working in communications, as I was in my first posting, it\u2019s best not to tell the head of the UNDP that they can\u2019t put \u2018capacity building\u2019 into a press release because \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean anything\u201d.

Saving the world of course    And finally, you might want to note that the requirement for everyone to have VHF radios and communicate with a central radio room basically means the end of privacy. To take another colleague\u2019s experience: if you inform the radio operator \u2013 as per protocol \u2013 that you are going to a bar with the rest of the office and everyone checks back in when they are home except you and the logistician who reports his position as being in a hotel \u201cwith guest\u201d, everyone \u2013 including all the drivers \u2013 will know what you were up to by the morning.
