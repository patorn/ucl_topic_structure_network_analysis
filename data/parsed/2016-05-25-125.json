  "body": "\u201cOnce there was a Mexican girl whose name was Frida,\u201d begins one of the 100 fairytale reinventions included in Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls. A new children\u2019s book that sets out to confront gender stereotypes, it has quickly raised more than $600,000 (\u00a3409,000) on Kickstarter. Created by Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, co-founders of children\u2019s media company Timbuktu Labs, the book tells the stories of 100 great women, from Kahlo to Elizabeth I to Serena Williams, illustrated by female artists from around the world. Favilli and Cavallo launched their Kickstarter a month ago, with the goal of making $40,000, and printing their first 1,000 copies. With hours to go before closing to further pledges, their fundraising total stands at $624,905. \u201cIt\u2019s insane. We were expecting the project to be successful but not at this level,\u201d said Favilli. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond any possible dream.\u201d     \u2018Venus and Serena would train every day...\u2019 Photograph: Timbuktu Labs    The pair have now added a series of \u201cstretch goals\u201d to their Kickstarter, including a week of workshops in Rwanda about female leadership in January 2017. They estimate that they will be printing more than 10,000 copies of the book and are also planning an edition for general distribution, once the fundraiser ends on Wednesday. \u201cWe chose to write the stories in the style of a fairytale \u2013 lots of them start \u2018once upon a time\u2019,\u201d said Favilli. \u201cWe are really thinking of the book as a modern fairytale that children will read at bedtime before they go to sleep.\u201d On their Kickstarter page, Favilli and Cavallo explain that part of the inspiration for the book was their own journey as entrepreneurs, which \u201cmade us understand how important it is for girls to grow up surrounded by female role models\u201d, because \u201cit helps them to be more confident and set bigger goals\u201d. They also realised \u201cthat 95% of the books and TV shows we grew up with lacked girls in prominent positions\u201d. Pointing to a study of 6,000 children\u2019s books published between 1900 and 2000, which found that just 7.5% had female protagonists, they add that not much has changed since.   Related: Picture books that draw the line against pink stereotypes of girls    \u201cWe know children\u2019s books are still packed with gender stereotypes,\u201d said Favilli. \u201cAnd we\u2019re both in our early 30s, we\u2019re female entrepreneurs, and we know first-hand how hard it is to succeed, to be considered, to be given a chance.\u201d The idea for the book, she said, \u201cdidn\u2019t happen overnight, it was more of a process. We started to send pieces of content out with our newsletter, short stories about extraordinary women, and at some point we realised that the response we were getting just from sending the newsletter was so great, so intense. This doesn\u2019t happen often with you send a newsletter; usually people don\u2019t open it. So it became clear this was a book we had to make.\u201d",
