  "body": "Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will confront Barack Obama over crimes committed by US military personnel after a worker on a US air force base admitted killing a woman on Okinawa. As the US president prepares to visit Japan for the G7 next week he faces tough questions from Abe over a case that could fuel opposition to the presence of US troops on the southern Japanese island. Kenneth Franklin Shinzato, a former marine who works at the US air force\u2019s Kadena airbase, told police he had strangled Rina Shimabukuro, a 20-year-old woman whose body was found in undergrowth on Thursday, according to Kyodo news. Abe, a strong supporter of the US military presence on Okinawa, said he was indignant over Shimabukuro\u2019s death and hinted that he would confront Obama next week.

We will demand that the US side take strict measures to prevent something like this from happening again.\u201d Police began questioning 32-year-old Shinzato who lives in the town of Yonabaru with his wife and child, after his car appeared in security camera footage in the area where GPS data from Shimabukuro\u2019s mobile phone was last confirmed. She had been missing sice late last month. The case is expected to complicate the already controversial relocation of a key US marine base on Okinawa, which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan and 75 percent of its bases. Most Okinawans oppose plans, agreed by Tokyo and Washington two decades ago, to move Futenma base from its current location in the middle of a densely populated town to a remote coastal area on the outskirts of the town of Nago. The plan would require the construction of a new offshore runway that local people say would destroy the local ecosystem and increase the risk of accidents.  Okinawa\u2019s governor, Takeshi Onaga, who opposes the Futenma move and wants the base moved off the island altogether, said the death of the woman broke his heart. \u201cAs I look back at all the developments to date, I\u2019m simply speechless,\u201d he said. In 1995 the abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl on Okinawa by three US servicemen sparked massive protests, prompting Washington to pledge efforts to strengthen troop discipline to prevent such crimes and reduce its footprint on the island. The Futenma deal includes the relocation of 8,000 US troops and their dependents from Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam and other locations. The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said: \u201cWe will do our utmost to alleviate the burden (on Okinawa) ... in consideration for the feelings of the people of Okinawa.\u201d Shimabukuro\u2019s body was found in a weed-covered area after investigators conducted search based on Shinzato\u2019s deposition, while police found DNA matching the victim\u2019s in his car, Kyodo news agency said. Foreign minister Fumio Kishida summoned US ambassador Caroline Kennedy to the foreign ministry in Tokyo shortly after Okinawa police arrested the 32-year-old former US marine. \u201cIt is extremely regrettable that the very cruel and atrocious case occurred,\u201d Kishida told Kennedy, according to Nippon Television Network. Kennedy replied that the US side would fully cooperate in the investigation, local media said. In Washington, state department spokesman John Kirby expressed condolences and said US authorities were following the case closely.   \u201cThis is a terrible tragedy and it\u2019s obviously an outrage. We\u2019re treating this situation with the utmost seriousness,\u201d Kirby said at a daily news briefing. Okinawa was the site of a brutal second world war battle but is now considered a strategic linchpin supporting the two countries\u2019 decades-long security alliance. But continued crimes by US personnel remain an irritant in Japan-US relations and a rallying point for Okinawans and others in Japan who oppose the US military presence. Next week, Obama will become the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb was dropped on 6 August 1945, killing 140,000 people instantly and in the months that followed. Japan\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Kenichiro Sasae, said he hoped the latest incident would not affect Obama\u2019s trip to the city, saying the Japan-US alliance had made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d in his eight years as president. \u201cThe Okinawa issue is the Okinawa issue,\u201d Sasae told reporters. \u201cThis is a tragic event, but a tragic event should not overshadow the fundamental objective of the alliance - that\u2019s what I hope.\u201d",
