  "body": "With the Imax-scaled Warcraft inbound, this lowish-budget Brit attempt to replicate gaming\u2019s immersive properties \u2013 stalking nerds around an, of course, mysterious corporation\u2019s wipe-clean HQ while they beta test a VR shoot \u2019em up \u2013 risks looking a bit Amstrad. Yet it\u2019s been capably produced: writer-director Charles Barker may cleave to a dusty old slasher-pic template but he hustles everybody briskly between levels, sending his industrious design team ahead of him to redress a presumably limited number of sets. If it\u2019s far from bleeding edge \u2013 within days, it\u2019ll look as dated as Tron and The Lawnmower Man do today \u2013 it\u2019s a modest upgrade on all those killer-website movies that popped up a decade ago, keeping us at least semi-interested as to who stands and falls. It\u2019ll fill a slot, if your Xbox connection is down and you feel inspired to quit the sofa.",
