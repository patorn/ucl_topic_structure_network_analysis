  "body": "Mylo Kaye, co-founder of Dreamr, explains why he should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:  Over the past 12 months, Dreamr has grown to now employing 16 staff and welcomes clientele from all across the globe. My determination to succeed starts with an 80 hour week, and only ends when the team are happy after our monthly team bowling session.  I have the versatility needed to be able to run a company, motivate staff and help secure business, which has meant Dreamr has grown and grown. With our growing team, everyone else is hard delivering products and customer happiness. My strategic planning continues to drive the company forward day after day.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
