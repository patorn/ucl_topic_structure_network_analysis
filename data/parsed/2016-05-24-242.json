We are waiting for a group of cyclists to form near the minibus queue, which in the half-light of 6am already stretches around the block. Lovemore consults his smartphone. Around 100 cyclists living in this informal area of makeshift shacks and dirt roads on the edge of South Africa\u2019s biggest city use WhatsApp to coordinate their journeys \u2013 there\u2019s safety in numbers. A couple more will be along shortly, he says. The group have agreed to let me join them on their commute to the northern suburbs where most work as gardeners and security guards in luxury shopping malls or the electric-fenced homes of the wealthy. Once the group is deemed big enough we join the slow flow of 4x4 bakkies and cars heading into the city on William Nicol Drive, Johannesburg\u2019s busiest cycling street. There\u2019s a small but steady stream of people on old steel-framed racers and mountain bikes sturdy enough to cope with the potholes and broken glass. Sure enough, not long after we set off, one of the ubiquitous Toyota Hiace minibuses swerves across the traffic, and us, to get to the kerb. Johannesburg may be a sprawling metropolis built for the car \u2013 but the majority of its 9.2 million residents can\u2019t afford one. The city\u2019s thousands of private minibus taxis offer a lifeline to their predominantly black users, filling the voids in the coverage of official public transport. With no fixed routes, it is a fluid \u2013 and in many ways fantastically efficient \u2013 system, but it is also unpredictable, with notoriously aggressive drivers.    Johannesburg is a sprawling metropolis built for the car, but the majority of its 9.2 million residents can\u2019t afford one    If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll hear a bip on the horn before they cut across your path. A couple of years ago one of the Diepsloot cycle group wasn\u2019t so fortunate: he was run over and killed by a minibus taxi. Another member, Artwell, tells me how he was seriously injured earlier this year when a bakkie drove through him at a junction. He was off work and unable to earn money for a week. No small matter. Artwell occasionally takes a minibus taxi to work in Rosebank, 15 miles away, but finds the 22 rand (\u00a31) ticket prohibitively expensive. With the early-morning queue, snarled traffic and a long walk the other end, it can take an hour on a good day. He says his bike is cheaper, and just as quick. Most of the Diepsloot cyclists are not South African by birth; they are immigrants who found their first homes here in an informal area on the fringe of the city. Nearly all of the group come from Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia or Zimbabwe, importing bike culture from countries where cycling has been less stigmatised.

Traffic congestion is already reaching what Simphiwe Ntuli, director for infrastructure at the city\u2019s transport department, declares to be \u201cimpossible\u201d levels. It\u2019s not uncommon for a sudden snarl-up to add 90 minutes or more to a short journey, and a two-mile rush-hour drive from the rich northern suburbs to the swanky skyscrapers of Sandton can take an hour. \u201cIf everyone comes into the city by car, then nobody can move,\u201d says Ntuli. \u201cWe need a solution.\u201d At present, though, it seems the Diepsloot cyclists are not the norm: Johannesburg\u2019s cycle modal share \u2013 the percentage of journeys taken by bike \u2013 is just 0.2%, or one in every 500 trips. It wasn\u2019t always like this. In 1935 the city unveiled a cycle lane on the key thoroughfare of Louis Botha Avenue, and a year later cyclist-turned-car dealer Frank Connock paid tribute to \u201cthe tremendous part played by the pedal cycle\u201d in the development of this former mining town. But in post-war Johannesburg \u2013 as in cities around the world \u2013 motor cars soon came to dominate the streets. Apartheid-era town planners gave little thought to poor, black people or bicycles, and for the next few decades it was all about asphalt highways to accommodate the wealthy white elite who could afford to drive. The Natives Resettlement Act of 1954 saw the forced removal of tens of thousands of black South Africans from the city\u2019s western areas like Sophiatown to new suburbs like Soweto, far away to the south-west. Between 1960 and 1983 a further 3.5 million non-white South Africans were forced into segregated neighbourhoods some distance from the centre, helping create the sprawling, low-density Johannesburg of today.    The air-conditioned malls may be more multicultural than two decades ago \u2013 but it remains very hard to walk anywhere    Apartheid finally collapsed more than 20 years ago but the legacy of the system\u2019s spatial planning remains in the millions of poor workers who live in far-flung suburbs, separated from the centre and their places of work by miles of hills and hard-to-cross highways. In the late 80s and early 90s, when the apartheid regime began to fall apart, Johannesburg\u2019s white residents fled the dense skyscrapers of the Central Business District and the formerly wealthy areas on its periphery like Hillbrow; they gravitated instead towards an alternative financial hub in Sandton to the north. Again, this new city centre was planned around the car, with multi-lane highways, shiny shopping centres and underground parking. Visit Sandton now and the air-conditioned malls may be more multicultural than they were two decades ago \u2013 but it remains very hard to walk anywhere. Pavements are often non-existent and drivers are not generally sympathetic to people on foot or on bikes. It can feel like a hostile environment to those not cocooned inside a car. The only walkers here are people who cannot afford to get around any other way.     Heavy traffic in Johannesburg\u2019s Central Business District. Photograph: Alamy    The city government though, led by ANC mayor Parks Tau, has ambitious plans to address this. Infrastructure director Ntuli says Johannesburg wants \u201cto become Africa\u2019s first cycle-friendly megacity\u201d. \u201cWe can no longer accommodate more cars,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at the traffic. It\u2019s impossible. We have to encourage cycling \u2013 we just don\u2019t have a choice. Even motorists who are hostile will come around eventually.\u201d The mayor\u2019s support ensures Ntuli\u2019s cycle infrastructure projects get budget priority. \u201cWe want to see more people cycling so we have to get out there and make it happen. It\u2019s not going to occur naturally,\u201d he says. Things began to change in the runup to South Africa hosting the football World Cup in 2010. Officials who visited Latin American cities on fact-finding missions came back enthused by Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) and its promise of metro-levels of service at a fraction of the cost. Crucially, these cities also considered cycling part of the urban mobility solution. Soon Johannesburg had one of Africa\u2019s first BRT lines, the Rea Vaya, alongside the Gautrain rail system to the airport and Pretoria. By 2012, as big turnouts at monthly night-time Critical Mass rides raised cycling\u2019s profile in the city, a group of volunteers formed the Johannesburg Urban Cyclists Association (Juca) to give bike commuters a voice. The city may be spread out, they argued, with hills and hot summers and many poorer people living far away from the centre, but these problems were not insurmountable. Johannesburg got its first post-apartheid bike lane in the Orlando township of Soweto in 2013. The following year saw increasingly gentrified Braamfontein get in on the act, with a lane currently being extended to Ellis Park and Sophiatown. Last year, the financial centre of Sandton opened its first segregated cycle lane and there are more in pipeline. A planned route from Sandton to the nearby township of Alexandra, where many of its low-paid workers live, has been hit by delays but has the potential to carry \u201cbig, big numbers\u201d and cut their commuting times significantly, Ntuli says. The city\u2019s Growth and Development Strategy 2040 enshrines the desired shift away from cars towards walking and cycling. There was even talk of Johannesburg, along with Cape Town, becoming the first African city to host a public bike share service \u2013 although a couple of years down the line the plans seem to have stalled.     Passing cyclists offer help and advice when Lovemore gets a puncture    Visiting the cycle lanes in Sandton or Braamfontein you\u2019re more likely to see a parked car than a cyclist, but Njogu Morgan at Juca says he has seen an evolution in the city\u2019s design standards. \u201cThe first lanes were built by road engineers who weren\u2019t trained in what works for cyclists,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a lot of fear about confronting drivers, so some lanes are too narrow \u2013 they just didn\u2019t have the guts \u2013 but the latest lanes are much better.\u201d    Cycling creates a very democratic space and provides free, or very very cheap, transport  Njogu Morgan     Concerned that spending a lot of money on bike lanes that get little use can be counter-productive, Morgan and other Juca members like chair David du Preez are now pushing the city to get involved with training (\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people here don\u2019t know how to ride a bike\u201d), giving poorer people access to bikes, and improving security. They hope a bike hub in the Brixton area \u2013 popular with students and creative professionals \u2013 will show the rest of city that cycling can work in Johannesburg. \u201cThe city has serious other problems \u2013 housing, clean water, crime \u2013 and people see cycling low down that list,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThere are concerns from the public about spending all this money but, as well as reducing congestion and pollution, cycling creates a very democratic space and provides free, or very very cheap, transport.\u201d Another problem is status. \u201cJohannesburg, like the rest of South Africa, is a very aspirational place,\u201d explains Morgan. \u201cAs soon as people can afford it they want to travel by car \u2013 a big 4x4 if they can \u2013 and in poorer communities there are very few people interested in cycling. I don\u2019t know what the answer is but it\u2019s the holy grail.\u201d     A FixinDiaries cycle ride in Soweto, Johannesburg    Part of the solution might be found in Soweto, where the group of entrepreneurs behind the custom fixie-building business FixinDiaries is working hard to make cycling cool for young, black people, and especially the young, black women who are rarely seen on bikes here. Co-founder Hussain Roos says cycling was seen either as an elitist sport for whites or as a humble mode of transport for those too poor to afford a car. \u201cAfter launching the fixie workshop we noticed that many women didn\u2019t have bikes and didn\u2019t participate in our rides,\u201d says Roos. \u201cOur Brunch and Ride is designed exclusively for women. We start off with coffee and juice, then ride around Soweto, with various pit stops. We have lunch and its back to the workshop for music from our local DJs. The atmosphere is vibey but chilled.\u201d Political will Nine hundred miles to the south-east, Cape Town too is hampered by the legacy of apartheid planning: it has the worst congestion in South Africa and 95% of the people who cycle in the city are poor, black men who typically live 20 miles away from their place of work. Early mornings see hundreds of shaven-legged Lycra-clad road cyclists on high-end carbon bikes touring the beautiful coastal roads, but the leisure scene seems disconnected from day-to-day reality. Once a year, 35,000 riders and huge crowds of spectators turn out for the Cape Town Cycle Tour, but few would use a bike to get to work: an estimated 0.5% of trips in the city are made by bicycle.

If there\u2019s no demand in that location then it\u2019s useless. Cape Town is the most cycle-friendly city in Africa but that\u2019s not saying a lot.\u201d Andrew Wheeldon, director of Bicycle Cities and the Freedom Ride, and former managing director of BEN, the Bicycling Empowerment Network which has distributed more than 15,000 bikes to school children, health workers and others, says both Cape Town and Johannesburg need multi-modal solutions. If someone is making a 40-mile round-trip to work from the Cape Flats or outer Soweto then they need secure bike parking near transport hubs, allowing them to combine cycling with the BRT, and allowing the person running the hub to make a few rand watching over the bikes and making repairs. \u201cJohannesburg started later than Cape Town, but they have some very inspirational people who are pushing all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cJohannesburg has the political will. That\u2019s why I think they are going to shoot ahead.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion",
