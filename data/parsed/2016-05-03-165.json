  "body": "On 19 May, Don DeLillo\u2019s 17th novel, Zero K, arrives in UK shops. It is the writer\u2019s first novel in more than five years. I\u2019ve read an early copy, and it may not surprise you to learn that it\u2019s a stonker. Funny, strange, often achingly moving , it\u2019s also a wonderfully brave confrontation with mortality from a man who is about to enter his ninth decade.  A man, also, who has done as much as anyone currently working to earn his own literary afterlife. It\u2019s hard to think of an author publishing today with a more impressive body of work, who has said more about modern America and the world, and who has done it in more commanding style.   Related: Don DeLillo: anatomising the everyday terrors of American life    His collected works are so good that it\u2019s hard to choose between them \u2013 there are few I\u2019ve read that I wouldn\u2019t recommend and there are plenty I would want to push on you with evangelical zeal. Underworld, for instance, is mighty. Staggering. Overwhelming. But it\u2019s also long and complex. We\u2019ll hopefully get to it one day on the Reading group, but for now I\u2019m going to make an executive decision. Because while it isn\u2019t easy to name the finest DeLillo book, the best place to start is clear: his breakthrough novel from 1985, White Noise. This winner of the 1985 US National Book Award is an easily readable classic that we can plough through in a few weeks, but also one that provides rich territory for discussion, as well as a useful comparison with the new novel Zero K. Both books display Don DeLillo\u2019s talent for sly humour and pointed satire, not to mention a commendable willingness to enter the realms of speculative fiction and absurdity. We\u2019ll hopefully have time for some kind of comparison towards the end of the month.   Related: Don DeLillo: 'I'm not trying to manipulate reality \u2013 this is what I see and hear'    But before we get there, a word of caution as well as encouragement. White Noise is a blast. It\u2019s approachable and enjoyable and a fine introduction to this ingenious writer. But it should not be underestimated. Despite its lightness of tone \u2013 and frequent hilarity \u2013 White Noise comes freighted with angst and uncertainty. It will mess with your head, your sense of self and reality and your ability not to think surprisingly dark thoughts whenever you hear the phrase \u201cairborne toxic event\u201d. I should also say that as a funny, satirical, campus-based novel it doesn\u2019t necessarily represent the rest of Don DeLillo\u2019s body of work. But then, no one book could. Like all of them, it\u2019s a unique and strange pleasure in its own right. I hope you\u2019ll join me in reading it. One more thing to get the ball rolling. We are giving away five copies of White Noise to the first readers in the UK to post \u201cI want a copy please\u201d, along with a nice, constructive comment, in the comments section below.
