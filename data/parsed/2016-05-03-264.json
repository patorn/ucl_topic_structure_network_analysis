  "body": "Related: Frozen fans urge Disney to give Elsa a girlfriend in sequel    Disney should include gay characters in the forthcoming Star Wars film, Episode VIII to help improve its \u201cfailing\u201d record on LGBT representation, US gay rights group Glaad (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) has claimed. The call was made after the organisation\u2019s latest annual \u201cstudio responsibility index\u201d found that none of Walt Disney Studios\u2019 11 films released in 2015 featured gay characters. \u201cAs sci-fi projects have the special opportunity to create unique worlds whose advanced societies can serve as a commentary on our own, the most obvious place where Disney could include LGBT characters is in the upcoming eighth Star Wars film,\u201d the report claimed. \u201c2015\u2019s The Force Awakens has introduced a new and diverse central trio, which allows the creators opportunity to tell fresh stories as they develop their backstory. Recent official novels in the franchise featured lesbian and gay characters that could also be easily written into the stories.\u201d Glaad\u2019s suggestion follows the current Twitter campaign for Disney to confirm that Frozen\u2019s Princess Elsa is gay in the forthcoming sequel to the highest grossing animated film of all time. A hashtag, #GiveElsaAGirlfriend has found currency on the social network, with MTV blogger Alexis Isabel Moncada\u2019s initial post on the subject having been retweeted more than 1,500 times.    Dear @Disney, #GiveElsaAGirlfriend\u2014 Alexis Isabel (@lexi4prez) May 1, 2016     Related: Glaad: Hollywood films are failing gay people    Star Wars fans have also called for the bromantic chemistry between Oscar Isaac\u2019s Poe Dameron and John Boyega\u2019s Finn in JJ Abrams\u2019 The Force Awakens to be shifted into full-on relationship territory in Episode VIII. The sequel\u2019s director, Rian Johnson, fanned the flames by retweeting fan art depicting the rogue stormtrooper and resistance pilot locking lips in January. Boyega himself hinted he was more than open to the idea of shifting the Finn-Dameron relationship to the gay side in an interview at the Bafta awards in February.  Glaad\u2019s call on Disney came as the annual studio responsibility index painted a depressing picture of Hollywood\u2019s record on LGBT inclusivity. Of the 126 major studio releases last year, only 22 featured gay characters, amounting to 17.5% \u2013 an unchanged figure from the organisation\u2019s 2014 survey. Two further major studios were also rated \u201cfailing\u201d by the civil rights organisation. Like Disney, Paramount released no films in 2015 featuring gay characters, while Warner Bros managed five out of 25 released movies, according to the survey.   Related: Would a gay relationship in Star Wars: Episode VIII be revolutionary?    Other studios, including Fox, Lionsgate, Sony and Universal, were all rated \u201cadequate\u201d by Glaad. Lionsgate was praised for including LGBT characters in eight out of its 24 releases in 2015, but the Glaad suggested Hollywood still had a long way to go if it was to achieve the levels of inclusion that have become the norm on the small screen. \u201cHollywood films lag far behind other media when it comes toportraying LGBT characters, cementing the industry\u2019s reputation as outdatedcompared to the groundbreaking inclusion seen on streaming series likeSense8, Orange Is the New Black, and Transparent,\u201d said Glaad president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. The survey singled out two Kevin Hart films, Get Hard and The Wedding Ringer, for playing on \u201cgay panic\u201d stereotypes. Glaad described Get Hard, as \u201cone of the most problematic films in several years\u201d, and a \u201cnearly two-hourprison rape joke\u201d.",
