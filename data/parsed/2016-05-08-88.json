We\u2019ve got over calling them Bardot tops now (bit of a stretch, wasn\u2019t it?), but their usefulness has given them longevity. Bare shoulders say summer and don\u2019t make grownups panic about their upper arms. Ditto the so-called cold-shoulder tops that are also everywhere. If naked shoulders feels too louche for an air-conditioned office, note that slinging a cashmere sweater over your shoulders like Jeremy Irons is totally acceptable.

Most women can\u2019t pull off a kaftan top outside of a brochure featuring sand dunes, beach huts and blond children. But most women have a relaxed shirt that they can summer up. Denim is good; pale blue is good; white works. Unbutton it down to the breastbone, wear jewellery and get the rolling right. Below or on the elbow is a little beta, above the elbow and you\u2019re comfortably in Jackie O territory.

No apologies for the fashion singular, a lot of the hack is in the way you sell it to yourself. 4Work the margins Make everything about your outfit incrementally more summery. Wear your hair loose, wear sunglasses, turn up a trouser hem and, most importantly, ditch the socks. Even wearing white tennis trainers or Vans without socks is a move towards summer. 5Take a hard look at last summer\u2019s shoes Do you have a pair of leather gladiator sandals? They\u2019ll work for another summer, won\u2019t they? Sorry, no. Absolutely not. Ditto the flip-flops that you think are so functional and anodyne they couldn\u2019t possibly offend. Hate to be the wardrobe Cassandra here, but flip-flops are style suicide. The good news is that sliders are hot, and available on every high street and corrugated retail park in the land. Wear with breezy jogging bottoms, cropped trousers or a long skirt.     Out with flip-flops, in with sliders \u2026 Fenty x Puma with Rihanna.

Not too many to confuse, but enough for everyone to find something they like. 7Mess about with camisoles and slip dresses They are summery and light and semaphore that you got the sunshine memo. You probably have something like this in your wardrobe. Wear a T-shirt under a slip dress \u2013 looks right and swerves the whole bra-on-display issue. Or for those brave enough to stand up to this summer ambush and laugh in its meteorological face: wear a camisole over a shirt. It\u2019s called summer layering and it is seriously happening.",
