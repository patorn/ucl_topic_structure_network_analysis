  "body": "Thursday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood The Brigadier Gerard Stakes meeting at Sandown is Britain\u2019s best evening card of the year by some distance, and the racing at the Esher track is up to its usual standard on Thursday night with at least half a dozen horses in action who will be mixing it with the very best at Royal Ascot next time out.   Related: Horse racing tips: Thursday 26 May    The betting suggests that the feature event is between Intilaaq and Time Test, who could both be lining up at Group One level next time, though Western Hymn\u2019s course form makes him a 5-1 chance and Scottish, who has joined Charlie Appleby from Andrew Balding, is not out of it either. Scottish, in fact, is possibly overpriced at 7-1 as his form when winning at Ayr\u2019s Western meeting last year was franked when Exosphere ran away with the Jockey Club Stakes on 2,000 Guineas day. He is running for the first time since today, however, while Time Test\u2019s 5lb penalty for a Group Two success last year just tips the balance towards Intilaaq (7.40). Mehmas (6.35), who looked as good as any juvenile seen out this year when successful at Newbury last time out, should have the beating of Chupalla in the National Stakes. Again, though, it is not cut and dried as Chupalla\u2019s winning form at Kempton in March has been backed up several times, most recently when Rapacity Alexander won well at Lingfield yesterday. Max Dynamite (7.05), the runner-up in the Melbourne Cup in November, is the obvious choice in the Henry II Stakes. Time Check (8.35) will take all the beating on the second all-weather card at Newcastle this evening, while Rustique (3.50) and Melgate Melody (4.20), who showed significant improvement on his seasonal debut at Redcar 10 days ago, both arrive at Chelmsford City\u2019s meeting this afternoon on workable marks. HAPPY BIRTHDAY William36! One of our regulars has reached a milestone birthday today. On behalf of all at Talking Horses, we\u2019d like to wish you many happy returns, William36.
