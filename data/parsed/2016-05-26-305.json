  "body": "Two pensioners \u2013 fine old ladies, one scouser-Irish, the other Cardiffian \u2013 are in need of urgent care. Once grand and beautiful, they have fallen on hard times. They are poor, sick, unsteady, leaky, incontinent. And while some remember and miss them in their prime, others rub their hands impatiently and expectantly, waiting for them to go \u2026 Oh, hang on, they\u2019re poor now, how does that work with the vultures? Anyway \u2013 maybe you guessed \u2013 they\u2019re not really old ladies, they\u2019re buildings: the Wellington Rooms in Liverpool and Cardiff\u2019s Coal Exchange. Nick Broomfield has made Going Going Gone (BBC4) about them. Yes, Nick Broomfield, man with headphones, famous maker of films \u2013 about prostitution, Sarah Palin, South Africa, war in Iraq, Biggie and Tupac, Kurt and Courtney, the life and execution of a serial killer. Perhaps this isn\u2019t so out of character, as this programme is not just about architecture (although he has, he says, \u201calways been fascinated by buildings and history\u201d), but also about injustice and death. Not execution by lethal injection (as his film about serial killer Aileen Wuornos was), but slow, drawn-out euthanasia, through starvation and neglect. Manslaughter maybe. The building-person thing isn\u2019t so ridiculous. Of course buildings \u2013 particularly interesting ones such as these \u2013 have personality. And it\u2019s about the people who lived and loved and everything else in them, about the communities in which they sat and what they meant to those communities.     In search of architectural personalities \u2026 film-maker Nick Broomfield confronts the barrier around Cardiff\u2019s Coal Exchange. Photograph: Kyle Gibbon/BBC/Lafayette Film    Broomfield \u2013 for whom both buildings meant something at some point \u2013 is very good at bringing this out. He goes in, sometimes with permission, sometimes less so (I think Nick might be quite keen to show us how bold he is, scaling a security fence, climbing the scaffolding \u2026 oh and not getting in, waiting for permission, which does come). And it\u2019s not just about the neoclassical splendour and ornate ceilings, it\u2019s about the ghostly echoes of happier times \u2013 Irish dancing in Liverpool (the Wellington Rooms was the Irish Club for a long time), blokey trading, then later gigging and raving in Cardiff. He does better than bring back the sounds of the past to the crumbling, leaky present \u2013 he brings back some of the people, too. Such as Sean, who first saw and fell in love with his wife at the Irish Club. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d Sean says after he chokes up at the memory. Don\u2019t be, Sean, as Nick says, it\u2019s fantastic. And Barbara and Ellen who met dancing 70 years ago at the Wellington Rooms and are still best friends. \u201cYou can just hear that music from years ago,\u201d one of them says, as they wander around the rubble. They can, indeed, hear it today: Nick has laid on a band, and Barbara and Ellen dance in the Wellington Rooms once again, without a care in the world. Lovely. And sad.     Spot, Hexyc and Tibo \u2026 Secret Life of the Human Pups. Photograph: Richard Ansett/Channel 4 images    I\u2019ve been trying \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to persuade my family we should get a dog. I was thinking of something small that fits in a bag, maybe a dachshund. But having seen Secret Life of the Human Pups (Channel 4), I\u2019m wondering if one of these might be the answer. I wasn\u2019t even aware of this subculture, but apparently there are up to 10,000 men (they tend to be men) in Britain who like to dress up as, and behave like dogs. Men such as 32-year-old theatre technician Tom, AKA Spot, and currently Mr Puppy UK. Tom was engaged to Rachel, but now they\u2019re just friends. (Rachel\u2019s very tolerant of the puppy play, will scratch Spot\u2019s ear or throw him a squeaky toy, but I think she\u2019d rather have him back as Tom, and be still engaged). But now he has \u2013 and lives with \u2013 a handler, Colin. Handlers like to be boss, to be adored and obeyed. Pups also like to be loved, but it\u2019s more about pleasing and playing. Are they romantically involved? \u201cIt\u2019s primarily handler and pup,\u201d says Colin. \u201cYeah, friendly benefits on the domestic side,\u201d adds Tom. Is that yes? No? Sometimes? I still don\u2019t know. Anyway, it\u2019s Colin and not Rachel going to Antwerp with Tom/Spot for Mr Puppy Europe. (How would Brexit affect that I wonder, if Tom wants to try again next year?) In Antwerp it seems clearer, looks more obviously BDSM (bondage and discipline, sadomasochism) from what they\u2019re wearing. Maybe that\u2019s why Tom only manages third place, he\u2019s just a bit too tame. And comes home with his tail between his legs. An eye-opener, but quite complicated and I\u2019m not sure I completely understand. I think I\u2019m going to stick with wanting what Colin refers to as a \u201cbiological dog\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 May 2016. An earlier version referred to Aileen Wuornos as Eileen Wournos.",
