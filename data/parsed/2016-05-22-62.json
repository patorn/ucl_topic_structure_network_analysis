  "body": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, has confirmed Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, a close ally for two decades and a co-founder of the ruling AK party, as his new prime minister, taking a big step towards the stronger presidential powers he has long sought. Speaking to members of the party that he and Erdo\u011fan co-founded, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m called for changes to the Turkish constitution to give more authority to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s office and erode the powers of the prime minister. \u201cAre you ready to bring in a presidential system?\u201d Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m asked members of the ruling AK party, who had just elected him as their party leader. As prime minister, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m will technically be the head of the Turkish government. But he said he supported plans to cede power to Erdo\u011fan, since the latter has a huge personal mandate after becoming the first Turkish president to be elected directly by the public in 2014. \u201cNow that the president is elected by the people, nothing can be the same as it was,\u201d said Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, who was previously transport minister. \u201cWe have always proudly said that we are Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s companion, that we share a common fate and a common passion. Mr President, we promise you that your passion will be our passion, your cause will be our cause, your path will be our path.\u201d     President Erdo\u011fan, right, meets the outgoing prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu at the presidential palace in Ankara. Photograph: Kayhan Ozer/Reuters    Commentators argue that Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has been installed for his acquiescence, after his predecessor \u2013 Ahmet Davuto\u011flu \u2013 was ousted earlier this month for allegedly blocking Erdo\u011fan\u2019s path to greater power. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was the sole candidate for party leader at the AKP congress, and he won all 1,405 of the valid votes. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s supporters say there is nothing unusual about a presidential system, highlighting how many western countries \u2013 such as France and America \u2013 have comparable systems. But his critics argue that Erdo\u011fan is seeking to build an autocracy under the guise of democratic norms. \u201cToday\u2019s Turkey is experiencing a tug-of-war between autocrats and democrats,\u201d Can D\u00fcndar, a recently jailed newspaper editor and critic of Erdo\u011fan, said in April. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m has made clear he will pursue two of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s biggest priorities \u2013 the executive presidency and the fight against militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) in the largely Kurdish south-east. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was elected as a deputy for Istanbul in November 2002 when the AKP won its first election. He was appointed transport, maritime and communications minister, a post he then held almost continuously in successive governments.  His ties to Erdo\u011fan date back to the 1990s when Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, educated in shipbuilding and marine sciences, was in charge of a high-speed ferry company in Istanbul, where Erdo\u011fan was mayor.
