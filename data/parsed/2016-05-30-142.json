  "body": "The Facebook post showed a photo of Kelly Hofer in a baggage-laden car, his older sister at the wheel. \u201cLeaving Home: On the tenth of June I left the colony.... New adventures await me,\u201d he wrote. The upbeat tone cloaked the significance of the journey. Hofer was leaving behind his childhood home in the Hutterite community \u2013 a little known Anabaptist sect often likened to the Amish but with a selective embrace of technology. He was moving to Calgary, a city of a million people, dreaming of a career in photography. He was also coming out as gay. Today, four years on, Hofer hesitates when asked if he considers himself a Hutterite. \u201cKind of,\u201d says the 23-year-old, slowly drawing out the words. With a small laugh he adds, \u201cIt depends on what subject you bring up.\u201d    Related: Hutterite life: a world apart \u2013 in pictures    One of the few \u2013 if not the only \u2013 openly gay Hutterites, Hofer has become a rare voice pushing for greater acceptance among the community, whose nearly 50,000 members live in more than 450 colonies in western Canada and the United States. \u201cThere\u2019s so many gay Hutterites and there\u2019s nobody talking about the subject.\u201d  But while Hofer was growing up, sex was not a topic to be addressed in public. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sex-averse culture.\u201d As a teenager, Hofer\u2019s friends talked about girls and their attraction to them but never brought up sex. He first heard the word \u201cgay\u201d when he was 14. The outside world felt far away, he says. Hutterites, who arrived in North America from Russia in the 1800s, often grow their own food, sew their own clothes and build their own homes. Access to technology varies among colonies; in Hofer\u2019s colony the internet that flows through the service provider set up by Hutterites in Manitoba is heavily filtered. Everything from meals to housing is provided, and members are expected to work and adhere to the faith.  Hutterites don\u2019t vote or run for public office, and the community in Canada has spoken out just once in recent history. In 2005, riled by proposed legislation to make same-sex marriage legal in Canada, Hutterite leaders voiced their opposition in an unprecedented public stand. \u201cWe will be classed as traitors in God\u2019s eyes, and we will live the darkest day in all of Canada\u2019s history,\u201d leaders wrote in a letter to Paul Martin, Canada\u2019s then-prime minister.  It was soon after that Hofer began realising he might be gay. \u201cThere was no way of confirming it,\u201d he says. On the colony, where many feared to even use the word gay, the concept of a gay Hutterite simply did not exist.  Increasingly it seemed his sexual identity was at odds with the expectations around marriage on the colony. \u201cI came to a slow realisation that in order to live a happy life, I would have to leave,\u201d Hofer says. \u201cIt would be easier to change my location in life than it would be to change my entire culture or colony.\u201d  Eventually, in 2012, Hofer, then 19, snuck out of the colony one morning, aided by a sister who had left the colony six years earlier.  As he settled into a new life in Calgary, eventually finding success as a photographer, he began learning the basics of life off the colony. \u201cThe way money works, for example, because you don\u2019t really get a sense of that on the colony.\u201d He had spent his whole life surrounded by the same 100 people; now he had to learn how to make first impressions.  Within a few months of leaving the colony, Hofer came out on Facebook. \u201cMy dream is for the Hutterite culture to be accepting of gay people like me,\u201d he posted online. \u201cSo that we may be ourselves in the communities we were born in.\u201d Reaction was swift. \u201cFor the most part it was pretty ugly,\u201d he says. Almost all of his friends online were Hutterites; some sent him messages of hate and disgust, others quoted passages from the Bible to condemn him.  It was exactly what Hofer was expecting. \u201cI did it to start a conversation about homophobia on the colony.\u201d In doing so, Hofer had finally found his place in the Hutterite community \u2013 as a voice on the outside pushing for change within. Today Hofer runs a support group on Facebook for gay Hutterites. The closed group counts some 26 members, including some who continue to live in colonies and constantly fear being found out. The aim of the group is to provide a safe space where people can explore and come to terms with who they are.  Some have said his efforts will be futile in a culture where men and women are constrained to narrow gender roles, down to the pants and suspenders worn by men and homemade dresses and headscarves of women. But since he came out online four years ago, Hofer says he\u2019s seen a shift in how some respond to him.\u201d They\u2019re a lot more accepting now.\u201d In his push to bring change to Hutterites, Hofer is quick to point out the community\u2019s strengths. \u201cI genuinely love the culture and I think there\u2019s a lot of things the outside world could learn from the Hutterites,\u201d he says, pointing to their self-reliance, sustainable farming practices and social structures. \u201cOn the colony, if you\u2019re disabled, if you\u2019re pregnant, if you\u2019re a child, there is no question asked about whether or not you\u2019ll be taken care of.\u201d These attributes were perfected over hundreds of years, as Hutterites were forced to move from country to country, adapting each time. Now the time has come for the community to again embrace change, says Hofer. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of gay Hutterites at home and they\u2019re not going to go away.\u201d",
