  "body": "Two years ago, I started dating a\u00a0woman I met online \u2013 we had a spark immediately. We were both recently separated; she has two amazing girls but I\u2019ve always felt uncomfortable with her ongoing relationship with her ex. I understand that a good relationship between parents is infinitely preferable to two parties at war, but they\u2019re just too caught up in each other\u2019s lives. In\u00a0the two years since we got together, they\u2019ve been on holiday (as a foursome) several times. Whenever I mention my discomfort, she says I\u2019m\u00a0selfish and jealous. Am I being unreasonable?Being aware of the benefit to the girls is very generous of you. And I agree that a relatively harmonious co-parenting partnership is very important for children of divorced parents. But it sounds like the family is benefiting from this arrangement and not you. It\u2019s important to establish which relationship your girlfriend thinks of as the primary one. At some point, as you deepen your connection with this woman, you would ideally become her primary relationship. Yes, she has a loyalty, a\u00a0history and a deep bond with her kids and her ex \u2013 there is no way around that \u2013 and it\u2019s important for her to maintain this. However, her response when you express your discomfort is not a loving one. At the very least you deserve empathy; at best, there should be a change in your partner\u2019s behaviour. My sense is that, if you are validated and prioritised by your girlfriend, there are multiple solutions. Perhaps you join them on these trips; perhaps there are more trips taken without their father. There will likely be a deepening of your connection with the girls over time as their potential new stepdad. All of these are important considerations and steps on the journey of integrating new family members post-divorce.   Related: Ask Alanis Morissette: since I\u2019ve been ill, I\u2019ve lost contact with many friends    Some people careen right into new regimes, some blend the expanding members into the tribe, some keep things distinct and separate. The key is that everyone wins, which includes you. I would try to\u00a0explore your girlfriend\u2019s commitment to you, to see if it is likely to deepen to the point where she will make sure you are happy. If not, you may come second in her heart indefinitely \u2013 and you\u2019ll have to figure out whether you can tolerate that. which would be something you would have to figure out in your heart if you were willing to tolerate. \u2022 Alanis Morissette\u2019s podcast is available on iTunes and at alanis.com.
