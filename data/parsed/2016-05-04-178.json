  "body": "The Formula One race director, Charlie Whiting, has insisted that the sport must adopt cockpit safety measures despite opposition from drivers, chiefly Lewis Hamilton. Addressing Hamilton\u2019s comments that danger is part of the attraction of F1, Whiting said that he believes it would be remiss of the FIA not to act when it has identified a fundamental threat to drivers\u2019 safety.   Related: Mercedes letter: we are not favouring Nico Rosberg over Lewis Hamilton    \u201cThat we are aware that accidents like this can take drivers\u2019 lives and we are aware of a solution \u2013 then I think it is incumbent on us to do our best to make sure we can protect drivers more,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not think there is any doubt about that.\u201d Hamilton has acknowledged and supported the FIA\u2019s work towards safety, but has been critical of both the devices proposed for the 2017 season \u2013 the halo design and the aeroscreen \u2013 and before the Russian Grand Prix he expressed his belief that maintaining an element of jeopardy was essential. \u201cWhen I get in that car, I know that there is a danger,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a risk that I am willing to take and that every single driver that\u2019s ever got in the car has been willing to take. Everyone comes to me who\u2019s just started watching Formula One and says: \u2018It\u2019s so dangerous.\u2019 That\u2019s a large part of why they are so in awe of what you do.\u201d However, the FIA\u2019s Whiting, who has said that a decision on which device will be adopted will be made by 1 July, does not accept this as a basis for rejecting cockpit safety improvements. \u201cI take his point, but there will always be risks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are driving a car that quickly. When you look at them on track, it\u2019s not until they go off the track that you realise how fast they are going and just what damage can be done. Cars will still look dangerous. Our job is to try and make them look dangerous without being dangerous. \u201cYou only have to have an accident to see that it is dangerous. There is nothing better than to see a driver get out of an incredibly damaged car like we saw with Fernando Alonso [in Australia]. Everyone expects it. We want to improve the chances of that happening while the spectacle is still there.\u201d The sport has made huge advances in safety since the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, not all of them initially embraced. The Hans \u2013 head and neck support device \u2013 was not universally welcomed but it has proved extremely successful and its use is compulsory in international FIA events. That Alonso could emerge effectively unscathed after his huge accident in Melbourne also proved how effective safety rules on wheel tethers and side, frontal and inverted impacts have been.   Related: F1\u2019s push for better safety united but drivers remain divided over Halo    But the cockpit is still exposed and the move towards some form of head protection has been under investigation by the FIA for some time, not least since Felipe Massa suffered a skull fracture after being hit by a spring in 2009 at Hungary, the same year Henry Surtees, son of the former world-champion John, was killed at Brands Hatch during a Formula Two race having been struck by a wheel that had broken free from another car. The FIA were already testing jet fighter canopies in 2011 when Dan Wheldon died in an accident at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, after his car landed cockpit-first in the catch netting. The British driver Justin Wilson died after after he was hit by a piece of flying debris in an IndyCar race at the Pocono Raceway last year and Whiting believes the FIA simply cannot do nothing to try to reduce the threat, despite concerns from some, on the grounds of both aesthetics and that any device would make it harder for fans to see drivers. At the Russian Grand Prix, F1\u2019s chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, said he did not believe the sport needed the aeroscreen or the halo. \u201cWe are aware that driver\u2019s heads are exposed to a certain extent,\u201d Whiting pointed out. \u201cFar less than they were 20 years ago, of course. But do you ever stop with safety research? Look at road cars 20 years ago some of the things you see on road cars now you would not believe would be necessary but they are now normal. Hamilton\u2019s team-mate, Nico Rosberg, who won in Russia and is 43 points ahead of the British driver in the championship is, in contrast, firmly in favour of implementing a device. \u201cWe need it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest danger zone which remains in our sport as we have seen. There have been some fatalities. It\u2019s an area where we need to keep pushing safety.\u201d Whiting believes Rosberg reflects a relative consensus across the drivers. \u201cSome drivers have said to me this is not F1 and won\u2019t be F1 any more but then other drivers, most drivers I would say, are in favour of it, in fact very, very insistent upon it being introduced,\u201d he concluded. Having first employed the aeroscreen in practice at Sochi, Red Bull will test their design again at Spain and Monaco, with the ultimate decision in the hands of the F1 commission.",
