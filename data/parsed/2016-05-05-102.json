  "body": "Three more big UK companies have suffered damaging investor revolts over executive pay at their annual shareholder meetings. The latest rebukes came at bookmaker Ladbrokes, consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser and construction firm Carillion. At the Ladbrokes AGM, 42% of investors voted against the company\u2019s remuneration report.  At Reckitt, known for products such as Dettol, Nurofen and Durex, nearly one in four shareholders opposed the group\u2019s pay policy that covers the next three years, and abstentions took the protest vote to 29%.  Almost 18% voted against the remuneration report for the past year, which included a \u00a323m pay package for the chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor. Kapoor is thought to be the second-best paid FTSE 100 boss after WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell, who was handed a \u00a370m pay package last year. At construction firm Carillion, 46% of shareholders failed to back its remuneration report, including abstentions.  The trio are the latest high-profile companies to face the wrath of shareholders, after huge rebellions at oil giant BP, drugmaker Shire and others. The chief executive of Ladbrokes, Jim Mullen, who took over in April last year, was paid \u00a3567,000 for the nine months he was in the role, and his predecessor, Richard Glynn, received a big payoff. Ladbrokes said it understood the concerns expressed by some shareholders over the payoff for its former finance director Ian Bull, who left in February. As \u201ca good leaver\u201d he stands to get up to \u00a3600,000 of shares for 2015. The firm said shareholder views would \u201cplay a key part in the board\u2019s thinking as remuneration is considered for the business going forward and the potential merger with Coral\u201d. Aside from its pay row, Reckitt is also embroiled in a humidifier steriliser scandal that has claimed around 100 lives and injured hundreds more in South Korea. Kapoor issued a personal apology at the company\u2019s AGM in London, just days after the company publicly accepted responsibility for its role in the controversy for the first time. The problem with the steriliser humidifiers, which caused deadly lung problems, came to light five years ago.  Kapoor said: \u201cI\u2019m personally very sorry and very much regret that our Oxy product caused harm to people in Korea.\u201d His apology came a day after South Korean retailer Lotte Mart and several online firms dropped Reckitt\u2019s products.  He reiterated that the company had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and vowed to ensure that \u201csomething like this never happens again\u201d. He said he would meet on Friday with representatives of the victims, a handful of whom had travelled to London and were demonstrating outside the AGM. Reckitt\u2019s disinfectant \u2013 a liquid added to the water of humidifiers \u2013 was among several products, also manufactured by rival companies, that were suspended by the South Korean government in 2011 after being linked to lung damage. At the shareholders\u2019 meeting the consumer goods group came under fire over top-level pay and governance issues. Cliff Weight from individual shareholder group ShareSoc said Reckitt had performed well in terms of shareholder returns since 2002 but even so, Kapoor\u2019s pay package was \u201cindefensibly high\u201d at \u00a323m for 2015, and \u00a356m since his appointment in 2011. Weight said a reasonable remuneration would be \u201cless than half this amount\u201d. He drew applause from other shareholders when he said: \u201cIt is difficult to have a cost-conscious culture when you are paid excessively yourself.\u201d Last year Kapoor said he would fly economy on flights under six hours as part of a \u00a3150m cost-cutting drive. A representative from responsible investment charity ShareAction urged Reckitt to follow other big companies such as Unilever in paying its staff the UK living wage as set by the Living Wage Foundation. Deborah Gilshan, from the Railways Pension Scheme, was also applauded when she voiced \u201csignificant concerns about the quality of board governance at the company\u201d and executive pay.  She levelled her criticism at the head of the remuneration committee, Judith Sprieser, who has been on the board for 12 years and was re-elected on Thursday. She said the pension fund had met with Reckitt\u2019s chairman, Adrian Bellamy, to discuss its concerns. \u201cIt is a pity that the remuneration committee under Ms Sprieser\u2019s leadership has failed to address these concerns,\u201d she said. Bellamy replied: \u201cWe hear you,\u201d but defended the firm\u2019s pay policy, saying it was linked to company performance. He added that Sprieser had managed the committee \u201cextraordinarily well\u201d and was therefore invited to stay on the board. Sprieser said that the strengths of Reckitt\u2019s pay policy had been its \u201csimplicity, consistency and transparency\u201d and claimed: \u201cIt works.\u201d She said: \u201cWe take the feedback we get from our investors very seriously,\u201d and added that some changes to long-term incentive plans had been made.",
