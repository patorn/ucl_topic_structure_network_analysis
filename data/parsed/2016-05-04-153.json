  "body": "Male-focused channel Dave has made its second move into live TV sports, striking a deal with Frank Warren to air the British Darts Organisation\u2019s World Trophy event. Pay-TV company UKTV, the owner of channels including Gold and Alibi, has been emboldened to extend its coverage of live sports after attracting a record-breaking peak audience of 3 million to watch David Haye\u2019s comeback fight against Australian Mark de Mori free-to-air on Dave in January.    Related: John Whittingdale could force BBC to sell off UKTV stake    \u201cThis is an exciting time for the BDO and I\u2019m thrilled that we\u2019re able to bring Dave viewers the BDO World Trophy, free to air and live from Lakeside,\u201d said Richard Watsham, director of commissioning at UKTV. \u201cThis is an important step for Dave as we continue to expand into important new genres such as live sport.\u201d Under the deal, UKTV, jointly owned by US pay-TV broadcaster Scripps and BBC Worldwide, will air ten hours of live coverage running from 12pm to 10pm each day of the event. The World Trophy, which has \u00a3150,000 in prize money on offer, runs for three days from 28-30 May. \u201cThough I have worked predominantly in boxing for nearly 40 years, I have also promoted and been involved in various other sports and entertainment ventures throughout my career,\u201d said Warren. \u201cI am delighted to have been part of setting this event up and securing the BDO one of the UK\u2019s leading broadcasters for the event.\u201d The BDO World Trophy event was set up in 2014 and the first two tournaments were broadcast by pay-TV channel Eurosport, which is owned by Discovery. The World Trophy event is separate from the BDO World Darts Championship, which has been broadcast exclusively on BT Sport since the BBC decided to axe coverage of the event after 28 years. UKTV-owned Dave, which uses the strapline \u201cthe home of witty banter\u201d, airs shows including reruns of 8 Out of 10 Cats, Top Gear, Mock the Week and QI, while it also features US programmes such as Storage Hunters and Lizard Lick Towing. In the past it has aired non-exclusive coverage of World Cup football and Six Nations rugby. Dave also has the exclusive rights to Red Bull\u2019s extreme sports programming such as Red Bull Soap Box Race, Cliff Diving and X-Fighters. \u201cWe are constantly looking for new opportunities and show ideas for Dave to keep our audiences entertained,\u201d said Steve North, general manager of Dave at UKTV. \u201cAfter the incredible experience we had with the David Haye fight at the start of the year we are delighted to be delving further into the sporting world by partnering with the BDO in what is a fantastic opportunity to offer fans extended live coverage of the BDO World Trophy.\u201d",
