  "body": "For some, plans at the Penrith Regional art gallery had gone awry before Malcolm Turnbull even arrived. \u201cThis is just the worst timing,\u201d said one cafe-goer, watching the photographers and TV crews file in. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be having a sick day.\u201d More welcoming were the Women of Altitude, a group of small businesswomen who had gathered for morning tea with Fiona Scott, the MP for Lindsay.    Cafe swamped w media.

Angela Maguire runs a marketing consultancy, but was keener to press the PM on education funding, announced last week to be $3bn less than under Gonski. \u201cMy concern is [that] my children, my daughters, might not have the some opportunities in education that I\u2019ve enjoyed,\u201d she told him. \u201cThere\u2019s an inequity that I feel has become so systemic.\u201d    Angela Maguire has grilled PM on public education funding, says inequality has become systemic #ausvotes @murpharoo pic.twitter.com/dYjmUGetSU\u2014 michael safi (@safimichael) May 10, 2016    An easier sell was Freya Brown, celebrating her first birthday on Wednesday, who posed placidly with Turnbull before the wall of cameras. Her mother, Kirsten, grinned too, but said later: \u201cAny cut to education funding is a concern to me. I think it\u2019s very shortsighted not to keep the Gonski recommendations going.\u201d Turnbull had set aside an entire morning for Lindsay, whose aspirational \u201cHoward battlers\u201d famously abandoned Labor in 1996 to deliver the seat to Liberal Jackie Kelly.            Tony Abbott says Liberal candidate Fiona Scott has \u2018sex appeal\u2019    Lindsay became prominent again in 2013 courtesy of Tony Abbott\u2019s suggestion that candidate Fiona Scott had a winning \u201cbit of sex appeal\u201d. And so it was again on Wednesday, when a press conference out front of the gallery blew off-course, possibly taking the day\u2019s campaigning with it. The PM had just finished extolling Scott\u2019s business credentials when she was asked if she could explain the government\u2019s superannuation changes. \u201cWell, the prime minister did actually quite explain it with a journalist earlier,\u201d she replied. Another asked about rumours Abbott\u2019s supporters were boycotting Lindsay to punish Scott for endorsing Turnbull in September\u2019s leadership spill. Would she reveal which way she voted?  \u201cI take my role as a parliamentarian very, very seriously. In that, the solidarity of the party room is absolutely crucial,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t leak from the party room and I don\u2019t intend to start leaking from the party room. I have never disclosed how I voted, and frankly I never will.\u201d Turnbull added: \u201cThose party-room ballots are secret ballots and they\u2019re secret for a reason. So that people can confidentially make a choice. Some people say how they vote. Whether they\u2019re telling the truth, who knows?\u201d Minutes after the press conference wrapped, word filtered through that the rest of the day\u2019s events \u2013 understood to be a walk meeting voters at a nearby Westfield shopping centre \u2013 had been abruptly cancelled. Official word was the morning tea had gone overtime.  Shock jock Ray Hadley, an Abbott loyalist, thought Turnbull had pulled his own sickie. \u201cApparently the prime minister is not too happy with the line of questioning whilst he was in the company of Fiona Scott,\u201d he told his listeners.  \u201cSo he\u2019s terminated his afternoon in western Sydney and he\u2019s heading back to the big smoke.\u201d",
