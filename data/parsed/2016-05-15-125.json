  "body": "Milo, the black teen vampire at the heart of The Transfiguration, likes his tales about the undead told with a fair amount of grit. The same could no doubt be said for Brooklyn-born writer/director Michael O\u2019Shea, who laces his first feature with references to George A Romero\u2019s Martin, Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s Near Dark, Tomas Alfredson\u2019s Let The Right One In, and most boldly, FW Murnau\u2019s Nosferatu. Unfortunately for O\u2019Shea, he does his film no favours by biting these genre classics. Even Twilight - a series Milo (Eric Ruffin) refuses to engage with (\u201cit seems unrealistic\u201d), and one O\u2019Shea probably doesn\u2019t care for - has more going for it.

Probably thinking he\u2019s hearing sex, he hurries out, perturbed. It\u2019s then that we\u2019re introduced to 14-year-old Milo, sucking the last ounces of blood out of the neck of his latest victim. Despite the ferocious nature of his attacks, Milo is as silent a vampire as they come. \u201cDo people ever tell you you don\u2019t talk a lot?\u201d he\u2019s asked at one point, to which he responds: \u201cNo, no one ever speaks to me.\u201d A loner, living a rundown housing project in Queens, New York with his military vet brother, Milo is constantly bullied by local gang members for his steely reticence. Haunted by the death of his mother, who committed suicide in their apartment (his father died when Milo was eight), Milo spends his days in his room, watching gruesome nature videos online, as well as VHS tapes of his favourite vampire films.  When he meets Sophia (Chloe Levine), a slightly older and deeply troubled white girl in the lobby of his complex, he\u2019s visibly tempted to snack on her. Instead, he opts to ask her out after some awkward courting. In one of O\u2019Shea\u2019s many on the nose moments, he has Milo take Sophia out on their first date to a screening of Nosferatu.  The Transfiguration is a character study first and foremost, spending all of its time with Milo. Problem is, he\u2019s so opaque that as a protagonist, he\u2019s completely impenetrable. Ruffin holds the camera with his forlorn gaze, but as rendered by O\u2019Shea\u2019s script, his character is inert, only springing to life when he feeds.

Each one is staged with little-to-no flair, save for an electronic score that swells louder with each bite.  The film is at its best in vividly depicting its environs. The rundown Rockaway beachfront that Milo and Sophia frequent, serves as a solemn reminder of the battering the area received in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Queens, as seen in The Transfiguration, is a grim and brutal place - worlds away from the neighboring Brooklyn Lena Dunham envisions in Girls.",
