  "body": "Welcome back everyone. I make no apologies for the fact that Peaky Blinders is the garish, glorious show of my heart and this hugely confident opening episode, overflowing with swagger and coming across like the adrenaline-fuelled love child of Downton Abbey and Miller\u2019s Crossing, only reaffirmed my adoration. This is a drama at that imperious stage where it\u2019s hard to go wrong \u2013 confident in its storytelling, secure in its character development and trusting the audience to join them on what looks set to be another tumultuous journey through the back streets of Small Heath, Birmingham and the equally dangerous corridors of power. Our heroes It\u2019s almost 18 months since we last saw the Shelby clan. In that time, Peaky Blinders has gone from word-of-mouth hit to A-list-endorsed phenomenon. Fittingly, then, the Shelbys too have moved up in the world. It\u2019s 1924 and Tommy has parlayed his success on the track into an enormous house in Warwickshire \u2013 I was particularly taken with the fact that he relegated the family portrait to the stairs and put the painting of himself and Grace\u2019s Secret centre stage \u2013 and is now a father and soon-to-be-married man. Of course this is Peaky Blinders, so his wedding to the winsome Grace (whose husband, it transpired, awfully, had killed himself) swiftly descended into horse races, boxing matches, mayhem and murder. By the time Tommy was gazing out of the window of his mansion while Johnny Dogs and the Lees burned the body of a Russian agent, murdered by Arthur, on a pre-ordered pyre, there was little more to say than: welcome back boys! I\u2019m glad the march to respectability hasn\u2019t slowed you down.     A wedding that swiftly descends into boxing matches, mayhem and murder.    Talking of respectability, I remain unsure about Grace. I can make a plausible case for why Tommy married her: she was pregnant with his child and family is everything; her husband killed himself \u2013 it\u2019s not clear when exactly \u2013 which would have made walking away from her even harder; marrying Grace is less overwhelming than marrying May, who was true aristocracy as opposed to cavalry class and, crucially, ensures Tommy\u2019s autonomy is intact; he does, despite everything, appear to love her. That final point, however, is where I always fall down. Grace has lied and spied and cheated for much of this show\u2019s run, however much she plays the charity-dispensing lady of the house now. As Polly rightly remarked: \u201cIt\u2019s only Thomas that\u2019s forgotten what you are.\u201d   Related: Cillian Murphy: \u2018Is this it, for the rest of my days?\u2019    And what of the rest of the gang? I continue to feel desperately sorry for poor Arthur. When the episode opened I thought the eldest Shelby brother might have turned a corner \u2013 the credits say he\u2019s married to the god-fearing Linda and he was clearly trying to stay on the path of righteousness, albeit with mixed results. (\u201cI\u2019m having a couple now and then to remind myself of why I\u2019m off it.\u201d) Unfortunately his brother didn\u2019t build a criminal empire by getting his hands dirty on his own wedding night, so yet again it was down to Arthur to dispatch the Soviet agent in a bloody scene that didn\u2019t shy away from showing us the ugly side of the Shelby organisation. Nor was he the only one feeling the stresses of Shelby life, as Polly was visited by temptation in the form of suave portrait painter Reuben Oliver. The little reveal that she took a gun to the door was cleverly done, demonstrating that all this new wealth hasn\u2019t brought the family security \u2013 if anything, the opposite is true.      Arthur, the eldest Shelby brother, is finding it impossible to stay on the path of righteousness.    The bad guys We don\u2019t yet have a clear lead on who this series\u2019 main villain will be now that Sam Neill\u2019s Inspector Campbell is dead. But we did learn the following: Churchill has called in his favour of two years before and it involves White Russians, tanks and is probably building up to the events of August 1924 which saw an uprising against the recently formed Soviet Union in Georgia (where the supposed Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna apparently came from). I imagine the series is also going to deal with the Zinoviev letter, which triggered the fall of the first Labour government in 1924, a plot point that will almost certainly pit Ada against her brothers (as well as give her more to do than roll her eyes at Tommy \u2013 hurrah). However, this is Tommy Shelby we\u2019re talking about and, as he reminded us at the episode end, he\u2019s a gambling man, which means Churchill\u2019s shenanigans are not the only thing in play here. Instead, our man with the many plans appears to be on the verge of executing an enormous robbery. As to the who, where, what, when and why of that, we don\u2019t yet know but it\u2019s interesting that Grace is clearly as much in the dark as we are. Notes and observations     A right royal Shelby wedding.    \u2022 The episode was beautifully directed by Belgian director Tim Mielants. At certain points \u2013 the boxing fights, the horse race \u2013 the whole thing looked like a painting come to life. \u2022 I don\u2019t trust the devious Michael and his bright future. He has backstabber written all over him. \u2022 I do, however, love John and his endless supply of cavalry jokes. Between those, Ada\u2019s socialist small talk and Arthur\u2019s stumbling wedding speech, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d hire the Shelby clan as public speakers any time soon. \u2022 Polly\u2019s would-be suitor Reuben Oliver is played by the wonderful Alexander Siddig. Here\u2019s hoping he\u2019s given more to do than on Game of Thrones. \u2022 I loved the many horse references \u2013 in particular, the fact that Tommy\u2019s Godfather-esque desk for posing seriously behind had a row of little horse sculptures. I like to imagine that the rest of the clan give them to him as presents. \u2022 I\u2019m not a huge fan of Annabelle Wallis\u2019s performance but I do love the scenes between her and Helen McCrory\u2019s Polly, which are always a barbed delight. \u2022 So Tommy is the one who gets out of bed when the baby cries? If it wasn\u2019t for the whole gangland crook, trail of bodies thing, he\u2019d be quite the early-20th century catch. Anachronistic but strangely right song of the week Nice use of Nick Cave\u2019s Breathless during the wedding vows, but I\u2019m giving this to Radiohead\u2019s You and Whose Army, which played out as Tommy impassively watched the body of the Soviet agent burn. Quote of the week \u201cNo cocaine, no sport, no telling fortunes, no racing, no fucking sucking petrol out of their fucking cars, and the main thing is \u2013 no fighting.\u201d I\u2019m fairly sure every single one of Tommy\u2019s rules was broken by the end of his wedding day \u2013 most of them on his orders. So what did you think? Are you happy to have the Shelby clan back? What exactly is Tommy planning? And will they all make it through the whole season intact? As ever, all speculation and no spoilers welcome below\u2026",
