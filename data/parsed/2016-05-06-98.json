  "body": "As a dictionary plunderer who knows a lot about a lot of things, Ian Duhig\u2019s eclectic enthusiasms and often laugh-out-loud wit make him poetry\u2019s answer to Stephen Fry. Popular but complex, comic yet serious, no one could accuse his verse of being dull or predictable. \u201cMy experience of poetic ideas is that they don\u2019t stand there waiting calmly until you\u2019re ready to receive them,\u201d Duhig once said, \u201cyou have to rush out and welcome them immediately.\u201d The presiding spirit of The Blind Road-Maker, his seventh book of poems, arrives in \u201cThe Ballad of Blind Jack Metcalf\u201d, a hymn to the 18th-century Yorkshire civil engineer, blind from childhood, who learned to read by \u201cfeeling headstone faces\u201d. Metcalf ends up figuring as a kind of alternative self to Duhig, having built the Leeds road on which the poet now lives. He is a man born in darkness who operates with remarkable determination and conviction, while the poet, in Duhig\u2019s own words, \u201cstumbles about in the light\u201d, trying to make sense of an often chaotic world in apparently plain sight. Stood, as one poem has it, \u201cIn His Shadow\u201d, Duhig demonstrates a refreshing and self-effacing respect for this almost folkloric figure: \u201cTesting stones to bed his roads\u2019 black tongues, / I heard how Jack rolled them around his mouth / \u2018like new words\u2019. But I wouldn\u2019t know about that.\u201d This being Duhig, though, The Blind Road-Maker isn\u2019t solely a series of character portraits of \u201cBlind Jack\u201d, nor even the example of his eventful life. The original working title for the collection was Ashtrayland, a term lifted from Bernard Hare\u2019s study Urban Grimshaw and the Shed Crew, a tale of all-too-real anarchy and sink-estate poverty among the dispossessed youth of northern England. \u201cAshtrayland\u201d is the eponymous Leeds gang\u2019s name for England, a place whose history and culture they feel distanced and excluded from. As the \u201cThe Blue Queen of Ashtrayland\u201d has it, \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s the Holy Grail?\u201d Resolving to commemorate and mythologise Britain\u2019s underclass on their own terms, Duhig enables the excluded to claim a home in the language. They may not have a round table, settling instead to \u201chand round / White Lightning in two-litre flasks\u201d, but through the poet\u2019s words the \u201cQueen\u201d and \u201cher knights\u201d become the modern stuff of Arthurian legend: \u201cHer hair glows, burnished as the gold / that trims her Nike cardigan; / Ionian white her Fila trainers\u201d. Merging poetic balladry with unflinching realism, these lines tread expertly between bleak comedy and angry social commentary. Given that he spent 15 years working in homeless shelters and drug-addiction centres before becoming a full-time writer, it is no surprise that Duhig\u2019s unpatronising sympathy and humanity shines through his verse. At the end of the disturbing \u201cAshtrayville\u201d, the poem has the reader receive a \u201csilent watch \u2026 for your long service\u201d to an unnamed, derelict city, at which \u201cyou weep with pride. Then you just weep.\u201d The compassionate political and social conscience that Duhig displays here is vital, an attitude our current leaders would do well to embrace. If the poet\u2019s interest in Metcalf and the characters of \u201cAshtrayland\u201d is partly about singing songs of the forgotten and voiceless, much else in The Blind Road-Maker focuses on poetry as a fundamentally collaborative process, operating within the shared and ideally egalitarian medium of language. \u201cThe Plagiarist\u2019s Song\u201d unpacks the complicated layers of meaning in that term: \u201cPlagiarus also means \u2018seducer\u2019\u201d, we are told, before the poem points to \u201clip service as unpaid // as Hell or Dante\u2019s debt to Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\u201d, only one example of the appropriation, incorporation, retelling and outright theft that not only defines, but to a large extent makes, our great global literary tradition. Where do we draw the line? As the poet writes of the folk singer Bert Lloyd, who deceptively invented the sources for his \u201ctraditional\u201d songs, \u201cWhich line was written by Bert Lloyd / the song won\u2019t care, of course, / \u2026 Ghost-writing for his unborn ghosts / perfected Bert\u2019s own style\u201d. In our self-centred age of attributed authorship and intellectual copyright, Duhig upsets the applecart by harking back to our folkloric oral traditions, and many a cherished modern example of literary cribbing and borrowing. His own such behaviour is a masterclass in modern parody and satire. The longest poem here, \u201cCanto\u201d, is a rollicking homage to Byron\u2019s Don Juan that is as bawdy and provocative as the Romantic poet could hope, its highlight an unlikely fistfight between the poets Geoffrey Hill and JH Prynne. \u201cThe outcome of their contest\u2019s undecided still, / being fought in an impenetrable fog\u201d, scoffs our narrator, \u201cis Prynne why now your average college nerdsworth / shuns Byron to study bloody Wordsworth?\u201d Elsewhere in the collection, Duhig himself lays himself open to being accused of such abstruse meanderings through dense cultural, historical and geographical references. But it is his sense of humour, self-awareness and democratising attitude that steer his poetry clear of pretension. As he writes of a poetry workshop he once ran with old soldiers at Age Concern, \u201cThey\u2019d lost that battle with the word, / believing too much better left unsaid\u201d. Encouraging them to let it out \u201cinto words they feared betrayed it\u201d, Duhig ends on a stark and humble note: \u201cAnd I learned why they were right\u201d. The Blind Road-Maker is a generous, smart and big-hearted book of poems, from a writer who truly values the whole of life as it is variously lived. \u2022 Ben Wilkinson\u2019s For Real is published by Smith|Doorstop.
