  "body": "The embattled Labor frontbencher, David Feeney, has struggled to outline Labor\u2019s position on big-ticket budget items in a car-crash TV interview seized upon by the Coalition trying to mask its own stumbling performance on spending figures.  The Labor shadow justice spokesman agreed his failure to declare a $2.3m house in Melbourne on the parliamentary register of interests was the biggest \u201cown goal\u201d of the election campaign last week. In an interview with Sky\u2019s David Speers, Feeney was asked whether Labor would keep the $4.5bn schoolkids\u2019 bonus, a Gillard government measure that was dumped by the Abbott government.

I\u2019ve been a little ... ah ... distracted over the last few days.\u201d The Coalition leapt on Feeney\u2019s confusion, with the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, describing Labor\u2019s budget position as being in \u201ccomplete chaos\u201d.  However, it helped Cormann recover from his own mistakes. On Tuesday, he had joined Scott Morrison to claim Labor had a $67bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the budget costings, only to end the conference suggesting it could be $32bn after journalists questioned the details. Cormann used Feeney\u2019s stumble to claim vindication, suggesting Labor\u2019s position was unclear on budget measures.  \u201cClearly David Feeney hadn\u2019t realised Labor had backflipped,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cThe question is, what other statements and promises have they made in the last three years that didn\u2019t mean anything?\u201d David Feeney\u2019s interview was the first he had done since it was revealed he forgot to declare the $2.3m house \u2013 which is currently rented out \u2013 for three years.  He is under pressure from the Greens candidate Alex Bhathal in his seat of Batman and he was further embarrassed when his tenants displayed Greens corflutes in the front yard.  Speers pressed Feeney on the budget measures, but the Labor frontbencher could only refer it to the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen.  \u201cI refer to the relevant shadow. I don\u2019t have the answer,\u201d Feeney said. Feeney was also asked, given his Northcote house was negatively geared, if he was a \u201crich investor\u201d who was making housing less affordable. Labor has promised to end all negative gearing on existing housing for buyers from July 2017.

Feeney said his wife, Liberty Sanger, a partner in the law firm Maurice Blackburn, did the couple\u2019s finances and the house was not declared due to \u201chuman error\u201d. \u201cThe point I would make is when people forget to register their car, they don\u2019t forget they have a car. I never forgot I had a home.\u201d  MPs are required to update their register of interests within 28 days and can be found in contempt of parliament and referred to the house privileges committee for investigation.",
