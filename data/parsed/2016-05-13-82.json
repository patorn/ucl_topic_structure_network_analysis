Though Plaid has only 12 members to Labour\u2019s 29, the nationalists managed to force an unexpected tie thanks to backing from the Tories and Ukip.   Formal talks opened to try to find a way forward after both sides accused the other of arrogantly trying to get its leader elected.   A joint statement issued on Friday evening said: \u201cWe have had a number of meetings today and they have been extremely useful. We are confident that we can find a way forward that will result in the successful nomination of a first minister next week. We will continue to work over the weekend, and look to resume formal talks on Monday.   Related: Welsh assembly standoff leaves voters baffled     \u201cAs it is important to take these talks through on a confidential basis, we won\u2019t be making any more comment at this stage.\u201d  Party sources said the talks had been undertaken \u201cin a spirit of cooperation\u201d with a view to the formation of a Labour minority government as opposed to being formal coalition talks. If the stalemate cannot be resolved the Welsh people face the prospect of another election.  Before the talks, the Plaid AM Simon Thomas had said he expected that the incumbent first minister, Carwyn Jones, would in due course become first minister.  Thomas said: \u201cIt\u2019s more than likely he will be the first minister but for us to be able to support that we want to understand in what way will he work, what will he do first 100 days, his priorities.\u201d  Thomas said some were obvious, such as the steel crisis and helping to keep the UK in the EU. But he said Plaid wanted to hear what Labour intended to do in other areas that were key during the campaign such as health and education.   The impasse has left some voters confused, with some wrongly believing Plaid has hatched a with its sworn enemies, the Tories and Ukip.  Both parties accused the other of arrogance. Plaid said Labour was arrogant to assume Jones would be first minister without reaching out to other parties; Labour said Plaid was arrogant to put forward a candidate for first minister even though it won only a fifth of the seats.  Thomas accepted that voters had been left puzzled. But he compared it to when Gordon Brown was defeated at the general election in 2010 and there was confusion until the coalition between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats was formed.  \u201cThis is the first time this has happened,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cYou can look at it as part of the growing process of the assembly becoming an actual legislative parliament. We are learning on the job.\u201d  Thomas said it was clear that Ukip, which won seven of the 60 assembly seats, had already changed the dynamic. \u201cThey are not there to play by the usual rules, which is fair enough. That is their choice.\u201d  The assembly has in the past been accused of being boring and predictable. \u201cWe needed livening up a bit,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t look too silly.\u201d Meanwhile Ukip\u2019s leader, Nigel Farage, suggested that Neil Hamilton, elected last week as leader of the Ukip assembly members, may be too old to be a frontline politician.  Former Tory MP Hamilton, 67, reignited his political career when he first won a seat on the assembly then successfully challenged the Welsh party leader, Nathan Gill, for the leadership of its assembly group.  But his return was met with hostility by the national party leader \u2013 15 years his junior \u2013 who said the treatment of Gill had been \u201cunjust and an act of deep ingratitude\u201d.  In a fresh attack, Farage questioned whether Hamilton was young enough to take on the role. \u201cI personally was not particularly in favour of Mr Hamilton\u2019s return to the frontline, aged nearly 70. But there you are, he\u2019s there, people have voted for him,\u201d he told LBC radio.  \u201cI think it is difficult to return to frontline politics after a 20-year gap when you are getting on a bit in years. But there you are, perhaps he\u2019ll surprise me.\u201d  Farage added: \u201cOne thing I will say: he is utterly committed to this EU cause and he has been since the 1960s.\u201d",
