  "body": "When the western United States collapses it becomes the home of The Republic, a nation perpetually at war with its neighbours.  June Iparis is born into an elite family which happens to live in one of the Republic\u2019s wealthiest districts. Fifteen-year-old June is a rare prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic\u2019s highest military circles; June is our first point of view, the second being Day. He was born into the slums, but made his reputation as the country\u2019s most wanted criminal. However when both worlds meet, June realises that the world isn\u2019t as malicious as she first thought. A mega problem arises that destroys both of the lives June and Day have come to know, however they both sounded like similar people - including their personalities, the same way of thinking and even the same hardcore abilities ( even though June was trained properly).          It seems as though Marie Lu is trying to compare how two people from different backgrounds face similar situations. At one point after Day is familiarised with June, he even observes that June is essentially the female version of him. Even when June and Day got into a shallow relationship, they didn\u2019t seem to have a strong connection, only that they are attracted to each other\u2019s good looks.  The plot was slightly predictable and clich\u00e9d and also had several gaps in logic. However the book was enjoyable and the young teen protagonists give a sense of self belief.
