Wang Zhongjun, a self-made billionaire who some say is China\u2019s answer to Shakespeare in Love producer Harvey Weinstein, purchased the letter at an auction in Beijing on Sunday, according to reports in the Chinese media. Wang, the 55-year-old chairman of Huayi Brothers Media, one of China\u2019s largest entertainment groups, reportedly paid 207 million yuan (\u00a321.9m/US$31.7m).    Related: Cultural Revolution reduced to footnote as Communist party says China has moved on    The letter \u2013 thought to be the only surviving work by Song dynasty scholar and government official Zeng Gong \u2013 was written on 27 September 1080, according to China Radio International. It is called Jushi Tie, which roughly translates as \u201ca letter on happenings\u201d. In his brief dispatch \u2013 which is written in an archaic form of the Chinese language that makes its meaning hard to grasp for speakers today \u2013 the author addresses a close friend, thanking him for his unwavering support in his career. \u201cJushi Tie exemplifies Zeng\u2019s elegant and neat penmanship,\u201d the China Daily reported earlier this month. Yin Guanghua, a Beijing-based art expert, told the newspaper the letter was \u201cimportant to understanding the official\u2019s life because it expresses deep personal feelings\u201d. As well as being a trained painter and art enthusiast, the letter\u2019s new owner is said to be China\u2019s 309th wealthiest person, with a fortune of about $1bn, according to Forbes. Wang has used his fortune to build a huge art collection, which he reportedly divides between homes in Beijing, Hong Kong and Los Angeles. Among the paintings hanging from the billionaire\u2019s walls are works by C\u00e9zanne, Monet, Picasso and Renoir. In an interview last year, Wang claimed he often snapped up masterpieces on the spur of the moment. \u201cThe impulse simply came,\u201d he said of his decision to spend nearly US$62m (\u00a338.7m) on Van Gogh\u2019s Still Life, Vase With Daisies and Poppies. That painting subsequently ended up on the wall at Wang\u2019s Hong Kong residence. \u201c[It will] make my home more colourful,\u201d the media mogul said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.  Chinese newspapers said Wang\u2019s decision to shell out millions on the 124-character letter was a possible indication that his tastes may be changing. \u201cWang is said to be gravitating towards impressionist and modern art, but his purchase on Sunday may indicate an expanded interest in classical Chinese calligraphy,\u201d the South China Morning Post reported.",
