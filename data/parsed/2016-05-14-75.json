A school system spokeswoman said Illinois\u2019 budget standoff had put summer school programs for more than 17,000 students in jeopardy. The programs largely serve students who are struggling to graduate or move on to the next grade, and they include students from the third grade through high school. Since the beginning of the year, both murders and shooting incidents have spiked in Chicago. There have been more than 1,000 shooting incidents so far this year, a 67% increase compared with last year, and roughly twice as many shooting incidents in the two years before that. Murders are up 56% compared with the same time period last year.

The potential cuts, first reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, raise questions about whether having academically struggling students outside this summer, rather than in classrooms, might put them at greater risk of violence.  Chicago public schools spokeswoman Emily Bittner blamed potential summer school cuts on the state budget crisis, and said they were \u201cdriven by the state\u2019s discriminatory funding\u201d. Summer school programs would not be eliminated entirely, she said.  \u201cOur priority will be to serve the most vulnerable students, but unfortunately, reducing summer school opportunities will set students\u2019 progress back.\u201d  Bittner declined to comment on whether the summer school cuts might impact the basic safety of Chicago\u2019s public school students, as well as their educational achievement.  A recent poll of Chicago residents found that 85% of black residents thought it was likely that a typical young person in their neighborhoods would be a victim of a violent crime. Half thought it was \u201cvery likely\u201d. Less than a third of black residents thought there was good availability of quality public schools in their neighborhoods.  The scale of the cuts to Chicago\u2019s public summer school programs will depend on what action the state government takes, Bittner said. A spokeswoman for Illinois governor Bruce Rauner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Illinois has not passed a new budget for nearly a year. Rauner, a Republican, has battled with the Democratic legislature over spending, taxes, and policies to weaken the collective bargaining powers of public employees.

Local advocates in Chicago said they had lost funding for summer jobs programs, support services for at-risk youth and violence intervention outreach workers.  Mayor Rahm Emmanuel, who is facing record public disapproval ratings, did not comment on the potential summer school cuts. His office referred questions to the school system, which is struggling financially and has announced a potential 20% overall budget cut for next school year. News reports called the cut the largest in the school district\u2019s history.  An analysis of public crime data by FiveThirtyEight found the increase in Chicago\u2019s violence dated to late November, when the city released a video of a Chicago police officer shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The increase in both murders and nonfatal shootings was closely correlated with drops in official statistics on arrests by police officers, FiveThirtyEight concluded. Some officials in Chicago have said that officers have become less proactive because of a fear of being the subject of the next viral video of police misconduct.  Bittner, the Chicago schools spokeswoman, said the potential summer school budget cuts would affect four major summer school programs that cost a total of $16.1m last year. One program provides an extended school year for \u201cdiverse learners\u201d. Two others serve students in the third, sixth and eighth grades who fail to meet the criteria to move on to the next grade. The last offers high school students who have failed courses the chance to make up the credits.  She said the school system was working with \u201csister agencies\u201d to look for alternative summer support programs for Chicago students.",
