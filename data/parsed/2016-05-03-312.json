  "body": "With the upcoming election and in the week of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s first budget as prime minister, there\u2019s a lot to talk about in terms of his government\u2019s policy impact on women.  It\u2019s highly unlikely Abbott-era cuts to community legal centres that serve women experiencing family violence will be reversed. Women\u2019s healthcare is threatened with the removal of subsidies that incentivise bulk billing, raising the price of mammograms and Pap smears. Even Scott Morrison\u2019s suggestion of tax cuts for people on \u201caverage wages\u201d of $80,000 a year is gender exclusive: average female full-time earnings are only $69,846.    Related: Health campaigners push budget wish-lists \u2013 politics live    So to have, perhaps, a necessary conversation about the reality of Australian women, I agreed to go on Weekend Sunrise alongside my conservative counterpart, Miranda Devine. Any hope there\u2019d be a meaningful discussion croaked within me like a kitten strangled when I realised the cameras were rolling and I was \u2013 surprise! \u2013 also on a panel with Mark Latham. The segment began with the provocation \u201cAre men second class citizens?\u201d Miranda Devine invoked the spectre of the \u201ccriminalisation of masculinity\u201d by man-hating mainstream feminists, before co-host Angela Cox identified herself a feminist who doesn\u2019t believe all men are rapists. I reminded everyone that gender-based violence actually kills women and Rory Gibson from the Sunday Mail insisted he isn\u2019t a misogynist just because women call him one.  Then, Latham. What happened next is what\u2019s become sadly inevitable; \u201cfeminism\u201d is something of a trigger word to the former Labor leader \u2013 he proceeded with a personal attack, invoking me as some kind of a feminist folk villain, just as he has done of domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty, journalist Lisa Pryor, and senior military officer Cate McGregor and many more. What the audience received was no spirited left/right contest of gender values, but Latham barking easily disproven claims about gender pay disparities, more personal insults and then a shouting match with host Andrew O\u2019Keefe. Asked by Cox if there was truth to the argument that men feel threatened by greater freedom of women. Latham replied:  No, I think the average man is doing quite fine. They ignore most of the left feminist claptrap, they ignore people like Van, who are a very very minority interest in our society. She\u2019s a self declared anarchist way way on the extreme left of politics representing perhaps point zero, zero, per cent of thought in Australia so she\u2019s safely ignored.  Latham\u2019s was a textbook demonstration of what feminists deride as a \u201cmanologue\u201d \u2013 a bitterly vocalised defence of an unearned male privilege to be the centre of everyone\u2019s attention. It\u2019s the melodrama of Latham\u2019s last-stand bitterness that makes great television, just as its the splattering of blood that renders Game of Thrones the same; when Latham\u2019s on, no one is safe, and that\u2019s why they keep getting him back \u2013 on Sunrise, the Verdict, columns and even a notorious appearance at a writers\u2019 festival that descended into a brutal, clown-show-level farce. But why Latham himself keeps coming back himself \u2013 increasingly, as the object not merely of feminist scorn but popular mockery \u2013 is the sadder question. Because Latham was not always an hourly-rate media misogynist. I remember well his stint as leader of the Labor party, and, before that, as a shadow education minister. That\u2019s where I met him a few times, in 1998. I was a student politician and we participated in some forums together. His declaration on Sunrise that he never knew me at all is either disingenuous or indicative of a degeneration beyond the merely political \u2013 you\u2019d think as one of the few senior Labor men from working class suburbs he\u2019d remember a young woman in public life who was, at least, one of his own. But for all Latham\u2019s self-avowals on Weekend Sunrise that he somehow still represents the working class, it\u2019s sad to see that a man once described by former Victorian premier Steve Bracks as having a \u201cpermanent chip on his shoulder ... constantly belittling groups of people from all walks of life\u201d has become even more chip than shoulder since leaving politics, even with his parliamentary pension. There\u2019s a cruel tradition within Australian politics where a fraction of the blue-collar brotherhood is left unable to navigate back to the \u2018burbs when the fairyland of political power deserts them. After championing the rights of the small side of town, politics inflates some male personalities to a size too big to fit back into it.    Related: Donald Trump or Mark Latham? Which pugnacious politician said it \u2013 quiz    I\u2019ve had the Eggs Hemingway in the invite-only Qantas Chairman\u2019s Lounge, and will admit they\u2019re just as tasty as priority bookings, private drivers, complimentary hotel upgrades and the chance to say whatever you want on TV because everyone knows who you are.  But Latham\u2019s seizure of anti-feminism is pathetic, because in a world where even Alan Jones is calling himself a feminist, it\u2019s a public role he can have because no one else wants it. The rise of the feminist commentator like myself \u2013 and all the other women Latham publicly barks at \u2013 is itself based on the majority social recognition that the hard questions about women\u2019s equality, economy and gender fairness are the ones that even morning television in Australia is maybe, just maybe, preparing itself to take seriously. And despite my visible frustration on the show, I actually have great sympathy for Latham, for he\u2019s yelling not even so much at women, as he is at a cloud that\u2019s passed him by. There is, of course, a life much richer to be lived than one spent waiting for the phone to ring again. Anyone left in the media who retains any sympathy for the man should do him a favour, and stop making the calls.",
