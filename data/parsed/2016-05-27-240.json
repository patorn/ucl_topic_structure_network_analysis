  "body": "The co-founder of the Safe Schools Coalition, Roz Ward, has resigned her advisory role with the Victorian government over a Facebook post reportedly labelling the Australian flag \u201cracist\u201d. A spokeswoman for Victoria\u2019s minister for equality, Martin Foley, confirmed on Friday that Ward had \u201cchosen to resign\u201d over an impending story in the Australian highlighting her Facebook activity. According to the newspaper, Ward posted a picture on Tuesday of the rainbow flag flying over the Victorian parliament, with the comment: \u201cNow we just need to get rid of the racist Australian flag on top of state parliament and get a red one up there and my work is done.\u201d   Related: Caving in to the right on Safe Schools could undermine Turnbull's greatest asset | Lenore Taylor    The LBGTI flag was erected above parliament the day the premier, Daniel Andrews, made an apology to the gay community for historic discrimination, including laws against homosexual acts. It is understood the Australian was going to publish a story about the Facebook post on Saturday.  Ward released a statement saying she apologised \u201cfor any offence that comments posted on my private Facebook page may have caused the government and members of the LBGTI community\u201d. \u201cThese were private comments that were never intended for the public domain.\u201d She said the comments did not reflect the views of either the Safe Schools Coalition nor the Victorian government.  \u201cI understand the damage that comments like these can do when taken out of context and so I am today resigning from the education working group of the LGBTI taskforce,\u201d Ward said.           Q&A: student Carter Smith\u2019s passionate defence of Safe Schools LGBTI program    The state\u2019s gender and equality commissioner, Rowena Allen, said she accepted Ward\u2019s resignation \u201cfollowing an inappropriate Facebook post on her private account\u201d. \u201cMs Ward has acknowledged that the post was inappropriate and may have caused offence, even if meant in jest, and posted in private,\u201d she said. Allen said the state government remained proud of and committed to the Safe Schools program.   Related: Turnbull government unveils dramatic changes to Safe Schools program    News Corp publications have been campaigning against the Safe Schools program, which is designed to make schoolyards more accepting of LBGTI students, but which critics argue pushes inappropriate sexual material on young people and promotes \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d. Ward, a leftwing activist and academic specialising in gender issues, was part of a reference group set up in September to advise a state government taskforce on LBGTI policies. The program has become controversial among Christian groups and conservative MPs, and in March the Turnbull government announced dramatic changes, including sharp reductions in the lesson content and a requirement that students get parental consent before participating.",
