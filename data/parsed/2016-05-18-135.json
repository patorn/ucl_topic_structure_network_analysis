  "body": "As a kid in Kirkcaldy, Dougray Scott liked to stow away in the back of the car when his dad left for work. By the time he was discovered, it was usually too late to turn back. Scott Sr was a door-to-door salesman, flogging fridge-freezers in the Scottish Highlands, and his son paid attention when he went into his routine.    Related: Chlo\u00eb Sevigny: I've had 'creepy situations' in auditions    \u201cMy dad worked on commission, so you had to get it right, you had to convince people,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWatching him was quite extraordinary \u2013 the emotions he presented to the world and the ones he kept suppressed.\u201d He learned about acting watching the old man sell white goods. Flash forward four decades and Scott is 50, a mainstay of Hollywood blockbusters and BBC dramas. He\u2019s in a beach bar at Cannes, a long way from home, although it seems that old habits die hard. His new film, London Town, is a coming-of-age tale with a late-70s punk backdrop \u2013 but the thing\u2019s not quite finished and is being sold in the market. This puts Scott in the role of salesman, like his dad before him, called in to do the heavy lifting himself. In fairness, he looks built for the task; tanned and trim, with a Celtic Cross tattoo on the underside of one forearm and the bushy moustache of a 70s porn star. He explains that the moustache isn\u2019t permanent: he grew it for a role he\u2019s been shooting in Romania. I suggest he keeps it; it makes him look like Tom Selleck. \u201cNo man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s totally Freddie Mercury.\u201d Ahead of our meeting I watch seven minutes of footage from London Town, in which a 14-year-old boy (Daniel Huttlestone) sets out to save his dad\u2019s record shop. Riding to his rescue is the late, great Joe Strummer (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), former frontman of the Clash, who agrees to perform at a benefit concert. So far as it goes, the film looks pretty good, earthy and uplifting, like a three-chord riff on Ken Loach\u2019s Looking for Eric, although one wonders if Rhys Meyers, estimable though he is, is quite able to match the propulsive, impassioned charisma of a man like Strummer. Then again, who is? \u201cJoe Strummer, I loved him,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAmazing guy. Tender guy. Looking at all these documentaries about him, that\u2019s what struck me the most, how tender he was as a human being. People think of punk as this aggressive, nihilistic thing. But he cared about everything \u2013 all kinds of music, all kinds of people. Maybe that\u2019s what punk was really about.\u201d   Related: Personal Shopper review: Kristen Stewart's psychic spooker is a must-have    He throws a glance around the beach bar, with its accompanying press junkets and battalion of security goons. \u201cFilm\u2019s different,\u201d he admits. \u201cThere\u2019s a barrier that exists in the film world, but I\u2019ve done my best to tear it down. Because I don\u2019t have publicists; I don\u2019t like dealing with that. I mean, I don\u2019t have Brad Pitt levels of fame, but when I walk down the street, I\u2019d rather be more accessible. And that\u2019s what Strummer did with the Clash. He was like, \u2018I wrote these songs for you and, more than that, I want to talk to you about it.\u2019 The Clash were very much a band of the people.\u201d In his time, Scott has played heroes (Enigma) and villains (Mission: Impossible 2). He impersonated Arthur Miller in My Week with Marilyn and Matt Busby in United, about the Munich air disaster, and was nearly James Bond until Daniel Craig got the gig. But in London Town he takes the role of dad, toiling to support his child, and this naturally made him think of his own father too.  \u201cThe guy in the film, he wanted to be a rock star and ends up running a music shop. And it was the same deal with my dad, he tried many different things. He was a footballer. He was an actor with the Unity theatre in Glasgow. He worked as a copyboy for the Daily Express. He did all these things, but then he ended up as a salesman, purely in order to earn money for the family. Those are the hard choices life presents you with.\u201d He recalls his dad coming to see one of his earliest acting jobs, when he was about 23. \u201cIt was at the Traverse in Edinburgh and I was playing a gay character who was very promiscuous. And there\u2019s this one speech in the play where he talks in very graphic detail about anal sex. And all the way through, I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Oh Jesus Christ, my dad\u2019s in the audience.\u2019 Because he had this very old-fashioned attitude to being gay, like a lot of working-class men at the time. But he was fine with it, he liked it. He said I was good.\u201d Is it true that homosexuality was illegal in Scotland until 1980? \u201cHa,\u201d he says. \u201cProbably still is.\u201d The trouble was that his father was old when he had him, already in his 50s. He fought in the second world war, in fact, although Scott points out that this not strictly true because he never saw action. Warming to his theme, he says Scott Sr used to boast he\u2019d been shot in the war, when what he actually meant was that he\u2019d been shot by accident, with a screw gun, by one of his fellow soldiers. Most war stories are tragic; this one sounds like a farce. On another occasion he was hospitalised after eating wild rhubarb from a French farmer\u2019s field. \u201cMy dad always said the rhubarb saved his life,\u201d Scott remembers. \u201cHe got fucking food poisoning like you wouldn\u2019t believe and so they had to ship him out. But right before they did, he was off in the khazi, outside the barracks, when he heard the air-raid sound. When the bombs came down he was so far away from the explosion that he came out untouched.\u201d Scott erupts with laughter; his moustache twitches like a ferret. \u201cSo yes, I\u2019m very thankful that happened,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the rhubarb, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d",
