  "body": "How about this for an alternate reality? A normal election campaign would be starting today. As it is, welcome to week four \u2013 we\u2019re nearly, almost, oh-so-close to the halfway mark, and the question of a hung parliament is back on the table. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have weighed in on the hypothetical as poll analysis shows the government could lose up to 16 seats in just three states. Cormann refused to rule out the Coalition forming a minority government with independents. At a doorstop in western Sydney on Monday, Turnbull said it was a \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d but that if any government was to formed on that basis, it would be between Labor and the Greens: the bogeyman that the Coalition has been evoking since the start of the campaign. \u201cThat is the chaos we all remember,\u201d said Morrison later. \u201cAnd the best way to avoid that chaos is to support the government.\u201d There are three independent crossbench MPs seeking re-election: Cathy McGowan, Bob Katter and Andrew Wilkie. Other hopefuls include Tony Windsor, who is taking on Barnaby Joyce in New England, and James Mathison, the former Australian Idol presenter, who has announced he will run against Tony Abbott in Warringah. (Look, you never know.) The Libs won\u2019t say that they won\u2019t work with the independents but are keen to push Labor and the Greens together, the Greens don\u2019t want to sit with the Libs \u2013 it\u2019s like trying to accommodate particularly trying guests at a dinner party that may never happen.  At least one potential arrangement has been ruled out: Turnbull said \u201cof course\u201d there is \u201cno way\u201d a coalition would be the formed with the Greens. The feeling\u2019s mutual, says Richard Di Natale: \u201cMy own view is that it would be inconceivable to support this government.\u201d Coming soon: a \u2018straightforward\u2019 plebiscite Turnbull has confirmed that the marriage equality plebiscite would be held this calendar year, as soon as possible after the election. He said the question asked would be very straightforward: \u201cwe will be asking the Australian people whether they support the definition of marriage being extended to include couples of the same sex\u201d. The announcement follows aspersions cast at Turnbull\u2019s integrity during Sunday night\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate when the prime minister dodged a question from AFR journalist Laura Tingle about who he was and what he stood for. (Van Badham\u2019s interpretation of Mike Bowers\u2019 shot of Tingle says it all.)    #leadersdebate #ausvotes #auspol pic.twitter.com/gMlXvrhJYI\u2014 Van Badham (@vanbadham) May 29, 2016    Earlier this month George Brandis, the attorney general, said planning for the plebiscite was well advanced. But Shirleene Robinson  of Australian Marriage Equality said that, regardless of which party wins the election, the quickest way to achieve marriage equality was through a parliamentary free vote: \u201cthat should be held as soon as possible\u201d. Labor has committed to holding a free vote on same-sex marriage within 100 days if elected. The Greens are also in favour. Politicians in glass-bottom boats \u2026     Bill Shorten, with Labor\u2019s environment spokesman Mark Butler, during a glass bottom boat ride at Green Island. Photograph: Jason Edwards/AAP    Bill Shorten announced that Labor will spend $500m over the next five years on protecting the Great Barrier Reef. \u201cIf we do not act, it is in serious danger of being irreparably damaged,\u201d he said in Cairns this afternoon. \u201cIf we do not act, our children will rightly ask us why didn\u2019t we. This is not a problem that I\u2019m inclined to pass on to future generations.\u201d Labor says it wants to work with the Queensland government to implement the plan, and provide a multimillion dollar boost to the CSIRO. This comes after Friday\u2019s revelation that the government intervened to remove every reference to the Reef from a UN report on the impact of climate change on tourism and World Heritage sites. In the wake of that story, the Juice Media have put together an honest tourism advertisement. (And First Dog on the Moon has asked the question that should be on on everyone\u2019s lips: \u201coh my god what is going on?\u201d)       Best of Bowers     Is it an election campaign or a holiday? Mike Bowers accompanied Bill Shorten to Cairns on Monday morning, where Shorten spoke to the media in the shade of some handy palm trees before his trip to Green Island on a glass-bottom boat.

Bill Shorten had a sharp response for David Leyonhjelm after the Liberal Democrat senator criticised Shorten\u2019s pledge to fund more women\u2019s sport on television: \u201cBack to the cave, stone age man.\u201d Leyonhjelm had suggested women\u2019s sport was not interesting enough to warrant additional funding at the taxpayers\u2019 expense after Shorten announced in Canberra on Sunday that Labor would deliver an extra 500 hours of women\u2019s sport via the ABC if elected on 2 July. In other Leyonhjelm news, Crikey reports that he is currently in the throes of a staffing crisis after policy adviser Helen Dale \u2013 n\u00e9e Darville, AKA Demidenko \u2013 quit in the middle of the campaign after a dispute over \u201cbeing subjected to oversight on Facebook stuff\u201d.

Seems legit. On Twitter Dale suggested that she\u2019d quit because of constraints on her Facebook freedoms, referencing a staple of meme culture when she tweeted \u201cShitposting for liberty FTW\u201d. She also confirmed that she was no stranger to \u201cthe awkward \u2018teach old people about dank memes\u2019 conversation\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s... difficult.\u201d    Shitposting for liberty FTW.\u2014 Helen Dale (@_HelenDale) May 30, 2016      Also confirming I am an excellent shitposter and do not need to be told how to do it :) @joshgnosis @JoshButler\u2014 Helen Dale (@_HelenDale) May 30, 2016    A spokesman for Leyonhjelm said: \u201cWe can confirm Helen Dale has left her position in the office of Senator Leyonhjelm and we thank her for her contribution. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate to discuss private arrangements in the media, except to say we are complying with all tax requirements.\u201d Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ... Over two historic terms, official White House photographer Pete Souza has chronicled the most intimate, candid and comical moments of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.

PM: \u201cHow old is your rat?\u201d    Turnbull was reported to be \u201cstartled\u201d by the discovery of a rat tucked in its owner\u2019s high-vis hoodie during a walkthrough of a western Sydney shopping centre this afternoon. The two-and-a-half-year-old rodent was named Splinter; his owner, Shane, dared the prime minister to \u201cgive him a pat\u201d.  \u201cHe\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t get pests in my home \u2013 he eats them all,\u201d Shane told Turnbull, according to BuzzFeed Australia. \u201cCockroaches, silverfish, ants, spiders, fleas, flea eggs. \u201cOnly bad thing he does is he tries to clean my teeth when I\u2019m asleep.\u201d The prime minister reportedly replied, \u201cAll right, thank you.\u201d We\u2019ll let The Walkmen play out this \u201ccinematic\u201d moment.     \u201cYou\u2019ve got a nerve to be asking my number, Mr Prime Minister\u201d   Never miss another catchup: If you\u2019re reading this in the Guardian app, tap on \u201cAustralian election briefing\u201d at the top or bottom of this page, then tap on \u201cFollow series\u201d to get an app notification as soon as the Campaign catchup publishes every afternoon.",
