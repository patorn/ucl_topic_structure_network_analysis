  "body": "I\u2019m a teenager, drunk in a shopping mall. Actually I\u2019m not, I\u2019m none of those things, it just feels like that. Really I\u2019m on a cruise ship, the cruise ship, the biggest in the world, for a two-night inaugural joyride from Southampton into the middle of English Channel and back. Royal Caribbean\u2019s Harmony of the Seas is a very big boat, an 18-layer wedding cake that seriously alters the skyline and the population wherever it docks. You\u2019ve probably seen the figures: a billion dollars to build, 362m long, 226,963 tonnes, 23 pools including waveriders and waterslides, 20 restaurants. There\u2019s a theatre, ice rink, casino, gym, spa, nursery, hospital, jail, morgue and much much more. My favourite stat is that 15,000 eggs are consumed on board every day. Some 2,100 crew look after up to 6,780 guests, a total of 8,890 people \u2013 that\u2019s more than the seaside town of Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, which we may or may not be passing (it\u2019s been a while since I saw the sea or the outside world).     The Harmony of the Seas, arrives in port at Southampton for the first time. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters    Now I\u2019m in a lift. I spend a lot of the cruise either in or waiting for one of the ship\u2019s 24 guest elevators. Or walking along long grey corridors. So long, like a corridor from a weird dream, numbered doors on both sides, and at regular intervals a friendly person from the developing world (the Philippines, Peru, Mexico, Jamaica, Mauritius) with a housekeeping trolley and a warm greeting.     No problem getting a sun lounger today, harder not to get blown off it. Photograph: Sam Wollaston for the Guardian    My cabin \u2013 our cabin, I\u2019m with my girlfriend and our four-year-old \u2013 at last. With a window, and a balcony, on to the outside, and the sea! Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t afford an outside window, or even one that looks inside over Central Park (the food mall part of the shopping centre, with real trees); it\u2019s OK because the cabins with no windows at all have virtual ones, virtual balconies, too; it\u2019s really a high-definition screen on to which a sea view is projected, but it\u2019s a real real-time image, taken from a camera on the outside of the ship, so it\u2019s pretty much like having an outside balcony. With the added advantage that if it all gets too much and you the feel the urge to jump, you can\u2019t; no one ever drowned in pixels. Jumping off, like norovirus, is a thing on cruises. Hey, let\u2019s not get too negative about all this. My colleague John Vidal has already done the big cruise enviro-boo. We say screw the planet, we\u2019re here to have a good time. The weather mid-Channel isn\u2019t making that easy, it\u2019s grey and wet. No problem getting a sun lounger today, harder not to get blown off it. All those pools and water slides, the mini golf etc don\u2019t look so tempting either. I don\u2019t think this is ideal cruising territory. Soon the Harmony of the Seas is off to the Mediterranean.     Aboard the Harmony of the Seas, some 2,100 crew look after up to 6,780 guests. Photograph: Jean-Francois Monier/AFP/Getty Images    What? The ship\u2019s big attraction, the Ultimate Abyss, is closed? (It doesn\u2019t work so well in the wet apparently: people stick). It\u2019s OK, I already did it before we even left Southampton, before the rain began. What is the Ultimate Abyss? A big purple tube that spirals down 10 storeys, like a large intestine at the arse end of the ship. You get in at the top end, shoot down and come out of the bottom; you\u2019re a human poo, albeit a very quick one. Why am I thinking about norovirus again? Actually, it\u2019s like a cross between suicide and norovirus. Also worryingly thrilling.           \u2018Like being a human poo\u2019: the Guardian\u2019s Sam Wollaston tries the 10-storey slide on The Harmony of the Seas    We find other things to enjoy. The bed is very comfy. The staff are all absolutely lovely and remarkably cheerful given that when they\u2019re done changing sheets, cleaning toilets, hoovering the forever corridors, waiting etc, some of them go back down to their windowless (not even virtual ones) shared rooms in the actual bowels of the ship, below the waterline. And they can be away from their families for six months at a time.     Our cabin has a window, and a balcony on to the outside, and the sea! Photograph: Sam Wollaston for the Guardian    We like the ship\u2019s big blasty horn a lot; \u201cMummy did a fart: high five,\u201d we say every time, which is often in poor visibility. Too many eggs probably, hopefully not noro \u2026 shut up about noro! Four-year-old actually loves it all, even if he doesn\u2019t fully understand what it is. \u201cAre we still on the ship?\u201d he often asks. I can understand the confusion; it seems the bigger the ship, the less shippy it is. And it\u2019s easy to forget, apart from the tipsiness, which seems to be abating. Must be getting our sea legs. We\u2019ll just have to get actually drunk then. At the first bar we enter, a uniformed lady closes a door behind us, and we start to go up. The whole bar. What the eff? Finally we\u2019re out of the lift, and into a bar, and the bar turns into a bloody lift. Maybe we should have guessed, it\u2019s called the Rising Tide and goes up and down between the mall and Central Park. The Bionic Bar is staffed by robots \u2013 less friendly than the other staff, and mainly there for the purpose of selfies.   Related: Harmony of the Seas arrives in Southampton \u2013 in pictures    We go to a Totally Awesome (and very loud) 90s Street Party. And take in an ice show, slidy dance, I\u2019d like to see that in a storm. Jamie\u2019s here: Jamie\u2019s Italian, where we eat (nice). And then later, at the 1,400-seat Royal theatre, we sing along to Grease, the live musical: \u201cWell-a well-a well-a huh, tell me more tell me more, was it love at first sight?\u201d     The Bionic Bar is staffed by robots \u2013 less friendly than the other staff. Photograph: Sam Wollaston for the Guardian    No, it really wasn\u2019t, pretty much the opposite, more like horror. Harmony of the Seas may be an engineering marvel but it\u2019s also monstrosity. After some time on board, though, I\u2019m beginning to see the point of it, and how \u2013 if you didn\u2019t want to think too much about anything, or care about sharing a confined space with nearly 9,000 other people \u2013 it might be a nice holiday for a multi-generational family. Anyway, right now we\u2019re \u2026 shhhh \u2026 quite enjoying it. Even if we\u2019ve all totally forgotten we\u2019re on a boat at all. Hey, maybe we\u2019re not, and it\u2019s not just those windows that are virtual \u2026 No, but they would have made the weather better, sunsets and everything. That\u2019s got to be the future, though, hasn\u2019t it? Virtual everything, in some kind of Truman Show bubble, perfect skies and clear consciences, and everyone happy. \u2022 Sam\u2019s trip was provided by Royal Caribbean. A seven-night western Mediterranean cruise costs from \u00a31,037pp all-inclusive for an interior room.",
