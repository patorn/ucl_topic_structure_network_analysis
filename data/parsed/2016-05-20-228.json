  "body": "A Dying Breed (Two Roads, \u00a314.99) is the\u00a0debut of former Today programme editor Peter Hanington. He is writing about what he knows (the BBC, Afghanistan) using Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s post-cold war novels as a loose template. The result is thoughtful, atmospheric and grippingly plotted. If it has a flaw, it is\u00a0Hanington\u2019s romantic, occasionally pompous sense of Today\u2019s importance \u2013 and of the importance to Today of middle-aged alcoholic white men, who do most of the clever, world-saving stuff here. One such man is maverick reporter William Carver, who suspects that the bombing of a tailor\u2019s shop in Kabul, where he is based, is not the work of the Taliban but an organisation altogether closer to home, only to be blocked when he tries to pursue the story. Recognising that Carver is too\u00a0unattractive to carry the novel, Hanington gives him a young, callow sidekick in producer Patrick. Whom Patrick is based on I\u2019ve no idea, but any\u00a0similarities between the novel\u2019s plain-speaking programme editor, Rob\u00a0Mariscal, and controversialist columnist Rod Liddle must be\u00a0coincidental.         One of the reasons journalist Stephanie Merritt\u2019s SJ Parris novels work so well is her cleverly chosen narrator-hero, former Dominican monk Giordano Bruno. The visionary heretic filters his superstitious, sectarian, 16th-century world for us with a\u00a0detachment that\u2019s gently ironic without ever collapsing into cynicism. He is\u00a0both out of step with that world \u2013 in the case of Conspiracy (HarperCollins, \u00a314.99), the fifth in the series, Paris during the Reformation \u2013 and inescapably embedded within it. Here, Bruno must investigate the murder of Paul Lef\u00e8vre, a firebrand priest affiliated with the Duke of Guise\u2019s fanatical Catholic League, which seeks to depose Henri III. But is Henri right that the Duke had Lef\u00e8vre murdered with the aim of implicating the king? And why, on his deathbed, did Lef\u00e8vre whisper to Bruno the word \u201cCirce\u201d? Questions, questions.         Elizabeth Brundage\u2019s fourth novel All Things Cease to Appear (Quercus, \u00a316.99) is a portrait of a dysfunctional marriage with supernatural shadowing. The chief mystery, though, is how something so beautifully written, so full of neat observations and telling details, can be so unengaging. At its centre are selfish art history professor George and his muralist wife Catherine, who have relocated from New York to a small rural town with their three-year-old daughter and bought a heavily discounted farmhouse where, unbeknown to them, a\u00a0double suicide occurred. The novel opens not with the family moving in, but with Catherine\u2019s subsequent killing and George\u2019s unconvincing insistence that it has nothing to do with him. Brundage backtracks to fill in the blanks, but her relaxed approach to pacing and addiction to supplying multiple viewpoints dissipates what tension there is, while the procedural aspects of the mystery seem to bore her. Still, she generates a convincing fog of unease.         Thomas Olde Heuvelt\u2019s Hex (Hodder, \u00a316.99) was originally set in its author\u2019s native Holland. Nancy Forest-Flier\u2019s English translation relocates it to the US \u2013 specifically Black Spring, a superficially charming town in the Hudson Valley. If she had made it Maine then the similarities to early Stephen King would be overwhelming, though there is also something Spielbergian in the way Heuvelt shows supernatural goings-on in the midst of everyday life. For Black Spring is routinely haunted by a 17th-century witch, bound in chains and with her eyes and mouth sewn shut. She enters houses at will; stands by families while they eat and by the beds of children as they sleep. It\u2019s a fabulous, unforgettable conceit and Heuvelt makes the most of it, exploiting the generational gap between those town elders who would prefer to keep the witch\u2019s presence a secret from the outside world and teenagers increasingly intolerant of the quarantine that\u2019s been imposed on them to contain the haunting.         There is a pristine classicism to Gregg Hurwitz\u2019s Orphan X (Michael Joseph, \u00a312.99), which borrows from Robert Ludlum and superhero lore to bring us Evan Smoak, adopted as a child by a shadowy figure called Jack and trained to be an assassin as part of\u00a0a secret US government scheme. When the Orphan programme (as it is\u00a0known) is disbanded, Evan moves to\u00a0California and devotes himself to\u00a0good works \u2013 taking out a slum-landlord paedophile cop, for example, after his\u00a0victim calls Evan\u2019s special number. However, his meticulously compartmentalised life makes him vulnerable \u2026 Orphan X is tight and tense in all the right places. But it wouldn\u2019t work half as well if we didn\u2019t feel Evan\u2019s pain and share his panic as\u00a0the worst-case scenario unfolds: another former Orphan, with\u00a0a less noble agenda, seems to be\u00a0hunting him. Orphan X is weapons-grade thriller-writing from a modern master.",
