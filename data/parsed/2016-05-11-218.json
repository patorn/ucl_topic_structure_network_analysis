  "body": "George RR Martin has tossed another morsel to the hordes of his hungry fans \u2013 a new chapter from The Winds of Winter. Told from the perspective of Princess Arianne Martell, the excerpt sees her travelling the countryside and reporting the news she gleans back to her father, Prince Doran Martell of Dorne, while attempting to control her wayward cousin Elia Sand. There\u2019s talk of bearding dragons in their den and of forthcoming battles, plus a rather lovely foray into a deep cave system.  Daemon Sand moved to her side and raised his torch. \u2018Look how the stone\u2019s been shaped,\u2019 he said. \u2018Those columns, and the wall there. See them?\u2019 \u2018Faces,\u2019 said Arianne. So many sad eyes, staring. \u2018This place belonged to the children of the forest.\u2019 \u2018A thousand years ago.\u2019  \u201cYou want to know what the Sand Snakes, Prince Doran, Areo Hotah, Ellaria Sand, Darkstar, and the rest will be up to in Winds of Winter? Quite a lot, actually. The sample will give you a taste,\u201d Martin wrote on his blog. \u201cFor the rest, you will need to wait.\u201d   Related: George RR Martin: when writers just can't finish their books    The novelist revealed at the start of this year that he would be unable to complete the sixth novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series, The Winds of Winter, before the airing of the new Game of Thrones series this spring. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a lot written. Hundreds of pages. Dozens of chapters,\u201d he wrote in January. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a lot still left to write. I am months away still \u2026 and that\u2019s if the writing goes well.\u201d He was quick to \u201cspike any bullshit rumours\u201d that he was now finished with the novel. \u201cMonkey is still on my back,\u201d he wrote, referencing an image of himself on the site with a monkey on his shoulder. \u201cBut he\u2019s growing, he is, and one day\u2026\u201d",
