  "body": "A major Japanese travel agency has cancelled a promotion offering passengers the chance to fly with female university students chosen from a \u201cpictorial book of beautiful girls\u201d after an online backlash. Local media reported that H.I.S. Co offered five groups of winners the in-flight companionship of female students enrolled at the University of Tokyo, who would share their knowledge en route about the overseas destination and its tourist attractions. Japanese news blog RocketNews24 reported the campaign \u2013 \u201cTodai Bijo Zukan university student will sit next to you for a fun flight to your destination plan\u201d \u2013 stressed the women\u2019s intelligence over their looks.

According to PR Week, five winners were to be given a choice of five female students with whom to \u201cspend their time in the air in a meaningful way\u201d: two engineers, a science student, a literature student and an education student. But hours after the campaign launched on Wednesday, it was criticised as sexist, with the agency receiving complaints on social media.    Wow, @HIS_japan. I've seen sleazy guys at clubs try to exploit @Univ_of_Tokyo women before, but this is new. https://t.co/PKPQyhvOm2\u2014 Brian David Berry (@BrianDavidBerry) May 13, 2016      @BrianDavidBerry @HIS_japan @Univ_of_Tokyo Clearly an idea born in a conference room full of old men.\u2014 Thomas Sturm (@thomassturm) May 13, 2016    Fewer than 12 hours after launching the campaign, the agency \u2013 based in Shinjuku Ward \u2013 scrapped the package and published an apology on its website that acknowledged the volume of \u201copinions\u201d it had received.    \u3010\u304a\u8a6b\u3073\u3011\u672c\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u958b\u59cb\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u5f0a\u793e\u4f01\u753b\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u3066\u3001\u3054\u610f\u898b\u3092\u771f\u646f\u306b\u53d7\u3051\u6b62\u3081\u3001\u7686\u69d8\u306b\u3054\u4e0d\u5feb\u306a\u601d\u3044\u3092\u611f\u3058\u3055\u305b\u308b\u5185\u5bb9\u3067\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u6df1\u304f\u304a\u8a6b\u3073\u3057\u3001\u53d6\u308a\u3084\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u81f4\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u306a\u304a\u3001\u95a2\u9023\u3059\u308b\u6295\u7a3f\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001\u9806\u6b21\u3001\u524a\u9664\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002https://t.co/Z1d0B4BNiE\u2014 HIS_japan \u30a8\u30a4\u30c1\u30a2\u30a4\u30a8\u30b9 \u516c\u5f0f (@HIS_japan) May 11, 2016    The Japan Times reports that H.I.S.
