It\u2019s easy, and very rewarding, to hop around the well-known sites \u2013 the Round Tower, Christiansborg and Amalienborg palaces \u2013 or to go on a slow canal tour of the highlights. But to really get under the skin of this place you\u2019ll want to make sure your visit takes in some of the modern landmarks and contemporary cultural powerhouses of the 21st-century city.   Related: Music, nightlife and hip districts: the best of cool Copenhagen    A good place to get an immediate feel for its enviable lifestyle is at the Torvehallerne, two stylishly designed glass and steel market halls that opened in 2011 and boast 60 stands selling everything from fresh fish and meat to gourmet chocolate and exotic spices. Some stalls specialise in indigenous fare, such as Bornholmer Butikken, which stocks chocolate, cheese and caramel from the Danish island of Bornholm; others ship fine produce from carefully selected fine food producers in France and Spain. Some stalls are quirky and quite unique: Pal\u00e6o, for instance, is the first restaurant in Denmark to serve what is known as \u201cstone age food\u201d. It\u2019s great to browse, but there are dozens of places selling snacks, wine and tapas, so you can either eat on the hoof or pick something up for a gourmet picnic in one of Copenhagen\u2019s lovely parks.     The market halls at the Torvehallerne are the perfect place to pick up a picnic or try out local delicacies.

Copenhagen is rightly famous for its commitment to design \u2013 and it is on show at places like Designmuseum Danmark, the National Aquarium, the Black Diamond (housing an extension to the national library), 8Tallet, the Copenhagen Opera House, DR Koncerthuset and the Royal Danish Playhouse. Grab a map and visit these on foot or by bike \u2013 it\u2019s a great way to explore and get a feel for the shape of the city. Nor do you have to limit yourself to looking and admiring \u2013 book a ticket at, say, the DR Koncerthuset and you get to experience French architect Jean Nouvel\u2019s masterpiece as he intended it \u2013 listening to the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, with a glass of champagne or two imbibed at the interval.  You can even get a fix of Danish design when you go to bed by booking into the cool contemporary design-focused hotels. What you will probably begin to notice is that there is, for all the fads and fashions, a traceable line of confidence and quiet audaciousness line that defines the specific character of Danish design.     New Nordic cuisine is based on traditional, seasonal ingredients served with a modern twist. Photograph: Nicolai Perjesi/VisitDenmark    And it\u2019s the same with food, for new Nordic cuisine is, at its core, a revival of long-running passions. The ultra-hip restaurants like H\u00f6st, Radio and three-Michelin-starred Geranium all take staples (oats, cheeses, ramsons, seasonal shellfish) and time-honoured smoking, fermenting and curing traditions from the Danish kitchen and give them a twist. The dining spaces tend to be divinely designed too, so you can feast your eyes on the cool interiors between courses. To explore something of Copenhagen\u2019s dedication to fine art, old and new, make sure you pop into the Danish National Gallery in central Copenhagen to see the three permanent collections and also to the ARKEN Museum of Modern Art, to the south of the city \u2013 built by architect S\u00f8ren Robert Lund to resemble a stranded ship and housing some 400 mainly post-1990 works by Danish, Scandinavian and international artists. Can coffee be fine art? Many Danes think so, and at specialists like the Kent Kaffe Laboratorium in the city centre, Rist Kafeebar on Vesterbro\u2019s V\u00e6rnedamsvej, Democratic inside the main library, and across the branches of the Coffee Collective, you can taste brews from all over the bean-growing world. If this sounds all a bit too urban and \u201caspirational\u201d, don\u2019t worry \u2013 Danes specialise in the ideal of hygge, which is a sort of homeliness and snugness, meaning that even the fanciest coffee comes with a comforting Danish pastry and a candle to calm down all that contemporary coolness.
