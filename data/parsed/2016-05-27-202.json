One is to change the world in some way \u2013 be it big or small \u2013 and the other is to reduce their dependence on grants. While funding bodies may like to put money into exciting projects, it\u2019s the relatively mundane things \u2013 paying the gas bill or the rent \u2013 the so called \u201ccore funding\u201d that most organisations have sleepless nights about. But one method of raising cash many may not have considered is starting a business venture.   Related: Charity shops: what's in store?    Getting started According to Hayley Trowbridge, executive director of Wehearttech CIC, a social enterprise in Liverpool that uses technology for social good, organisations looking to build a business may already have some of the tools they need right under their nose, including the use of existing premises, experienced staff and volunteers willing to lend their expertise, and the support of the community.  Trowbridge said: \u201cFrom skill-sharing, to tapping into volunteering and social remit schemes within workplaces, hiring out our own equipment and space, and selling our expertise as consultancy packages, the sector is really beginning to think and work in ways outside of the box.\u201d Nick Walsh runs not-for-profit community interest company Nickel Support in Surrey, which helps adults with learning disabilities into the world of work. It has developed a range of side ventures that not only help service users develop their business skills, but also raises much-needed funds. \u201cIt was quite clear to us from the outset that we did not want to rely solely on core block funding because we did not feel it is a sustainable business model,\u201d said Walsh. Among Nickel\u2019s business ventures are furniture recycling, where service users recondition unwanted items and sell it in a shop and on eBay. It has proven so popular that the organisation is in talks with the local council to expand it, with the hope it could become entirely self-sufficient in the next three years. Nickel also has a caf\u00e9 that runs once a week and stages events for other local people with learning disabilities. All of its ventures are run and managed by a board of people with learning disabilities.   Related: Public prefer charity shops to eBay and Gumtree, study shows    Walsh added: \u201cThe reason these enterprises were chosen is because they lent themselves well to the experience and skill set our staff team have.  \u201cThey all require creative thinking and give the staff the opportunity to be a part of the shaping of the enterprise.\u201d  Be creative Ciaran Shanahan, development manager and company secretary of the Halton Autistic Family Support Group (HAFS) in Cheshire, claims smaller organisations can miss out to national charities in the quest for grant funding, forcing them to get creative.  To this end, HAFS opened a charity shop in Runcorn in 2013 where donated items are sold to raise cash. It also helps to raise awareness of autism in the wider community and gives members valuable work experience. He said: \u201cThe shop opened after a major refit and clean up, decorating and re-carpeting exercise that took three months. \u201cThis was all done by our members and funded by ourselves.\u201d Even if they don\u2019t have their own premises or expertise in-house, exploring partnership working is also something which groups can consider.  Health Action Local Engagement is a healthy living project based in Shipley, West Yorkshire. Formed in 2003, last year it set up a community caf\u00e9 to raise funds after losing \u00a3194,000 \u2013 two thirds of its annual budget \u2013 after failing to win a council tender. It was able to open the caf\u00e9 in a local GP practice, a move which Helen Parsons, community connector co-ordinator at the charity, said showed how crucial it was to have a network of relationships with other organisations. She said: \u201cI think partnerships are key. I think as well the natural link between Hale as a healthy living project and the setting of the cafe within a health centre which helps raise our profile, promoting links with other health care groups.\u201d  Ask yourself these questions But starting a business is no simple task said David Saint, a former fundraiser for Scope, Sense, SANE and Arthritis Care and now chairman of Action Planning, which provides consultancy services for not-for-profit groups. He said they should ask themselves the following questions:   Why do you want to do it? Is there a better way of generating surpluses, such as improving fundraising operations?   Is it within your objectives and powers to start a business? If not, you may need to set up a trading company first.   What are your strengths? What do you know? What are you good at? What assets do you have?   What outside expertise, if any, must you bring in?  Saint said: \u201cRunning a business is very different from running a charity, and getting the right advice early on can save a lot of time, money and anguish.\u201d For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, join our community - it\u2019s free!",
