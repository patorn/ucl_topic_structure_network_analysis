  "body": "The Sacred Heart of Jesus village, in the Philippines\u2019 Nueva Ecija province, is home to 17 families who live in colourful houses, each one edged by plants potted in bottles and plastic bags. A woman pokes her head out of a lime green house. \u201cThis is Gawad Kalinga,\u201d she says. \u201cWelcome.\u201d Gawad Kalinga (GK) \u2013 meaning \u201cto give care\u201d in Tagalog, the most common Filipino language \u2013 is a social movement that emerged from a Catholic youth camp in Manila\u2019s slums more than 20 years ago. Galvanised by the destruction caused by typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,300 people in 2013, the movement has become a household name.  This year, from April to June, tens of thousands of volunteers are taking part in the Bayani (heroes) challenge, a countrywide project to develop GK communities through building houses, planting trees and repairing schools. It attracts students alongside army and business volunteers. In Sacred Heart village, volunteers and residents are building a further 28 homes. People pass bricks to a plot where others are digging foundations. Another group cuts and bends steel rods for the walls.

Seven months ago, say residents, the water in the village was chest high following a typhoon. Farmers resowed their crops, only to see them destroyed by another typhoon in December. The rice fields \u201clooked more like an ocean\u201d, says Tito (uncle) Juanito. \u201cIf the water is too high, you can\u2019t plant the rice. If there is a drought, you can\u2019t water the rice. I have been a farmer since I was 18. It\u2019s the only thing we can do.\u201d Juanito, who was elected village leader when, after a private land donation, the community was built seven years ago, was responsible for the evacuation and clean-up. \u201cThe water came in through the windows,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe were very sad and very hungry. But even though there are a lot of disasters, we always want to get back up on our feet.\u201d   Related: Philippines rockets up list of countries most vulnerable to disaster    Most of GK\u2019s beneficiaries are survivors of natural disasters \u2013 unsurprisingly, in a country where 130 million people were affected by such hardships between 1995 and 2015 (pdf). Communities start from a land donation, a request from a local authority or an approach from a homeless community. GK worked with Catholic missionary organisation Couples for Christ until 2009, but is now an independent NGO. More than 2,500 GK communities have sprung up across the Philippines, funded by individual donors, grants and corporations. At the heart of GK\u2019s model is a definition of poverty centred not on economics, but on a mental state. Its aim, its website states, is to eradicate a survival mode mentality, where it\u2019s \u201cevery man for himself\u201d. Communities instead try to foster a spirit of bayanihan, a tradition of helping out your neighbour. Every individual who joins a GK village must attend a course that emphasises security, participation, religious freedom, peace, tourism, productivity and the environment. Residents must sign a contract that gives them free use of the property but forbids its rental, sale or mortgage. GK wants to end poverty for 5 million families by 2024. To date, 250,000 families have been housed by the organisation. Despite significant economic growth, the Philippines ranks 115th in the UN human development index and a quarter of the population live below the poverty line. The man behind GK is Tony Meloto, who hopes to grow a rural economy less reliant on imports. The project is still keen to open its doors to the west, however.

Volunteers, students and entrepreneurs come here \u2013 from French universities in particular \u2013 to learn and share expertise. Dylan Wilk gave up his life as a British computer games entrepreneur in the UK after visiting a GK community in 2003. In 2008, he founded Human Nature, a natural cosmetics company that employs people from GK communities. Louis Faure, 23, arrived in 2014 for a six-month internship at the Enchanted Farm, a project spread over 35 hectares (86.5 acres) that links students with local farmers and businesses to develop food products. Two years on, Faure is running a poultry business, initially funded by the farm. He has 950 chickens and expects the business to cover its costs within a few months.   But Meloto\u2019s approach has attracted criticism. Observers have noted the dearth of independent assessments of GK\u2019s work \u2013 all the more notable as the movement spreads overseas. About 7,000 families live in GK communities in Jakarta, set up by Filipino expats. There is a GK village in Cambodia and others are planned in Malaysia and Australia. Last year, the Center for Philippine Studies at the University of Hawaii branded Meloto a sexist for a speech in which he reportedly said: \u201cThe greatest asset of the Philippines is our beautiful women\u201d. Meloto apparently added that he wanted to attract \u201cthe best and brightest men from the west\u201d. Meloto does not deny that his model is male-centric. \u201cOur women are motivated to study. Our men are not. That is the state of our development. When you\u2019re poor you look more at physical strength to develop. You\u2019d rather be into guns, drugs or drinking. So these girls will have to marry men with lesser qualifications than them. What kind of a future am I going to give them if I don\u2019t also motivate the men?\u201d  This article was amended on 31 May 2016 to correct the name of Tony Meloto in the subheading and to clarify that the 7,000 families living in GK communities in Jakarta are Indonesians. It was further amended to correct the number of GK communities in the Philippines and to remove a description of GK as a secular NGO.",
