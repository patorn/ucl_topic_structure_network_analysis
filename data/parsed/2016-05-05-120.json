  "body": "Some stories stop you in your tracks and The Untold: Child Rescue (Radio 4) is one of them. Much has been written about Rob Lawrie, who was caught trying to smuggle a four-year-old girl from a Calais refugee camp into the UK, so it\u2019s intriguing to hear his own words. \u201cThis is what you risk when those people on the news become your friends,\u201d says broadcaster Grace Dent, who adds the perfect amount of intrigue to the tale. At times, Lawrie\u2019s story weaves such a tangled web it could be fictional, but the sad thing about it is that there are real, vulnerable lives involved. \u201cIrrational, irrational, irrational\u201d is how Lawrie describes his behaviour on the night he loaded a pillow, quilt and teddy bear into his van and wrapped little Bahar up in the hope of taking her to Leeds, where she had family. He was intercepted at the border: two other stowaways were found in his van. As he was handcuffed, he remembers \u201ckicking up a storm\u201d, but all he wanted was to alert the authorities that Bahar was in the van. He was fined and escaped a five-year jail sentence for people smuggling, but his life was shattered. Lawrie comes across as likable, whether he\u2019s joking with a French film crew or stating matter-of-factly that he can understand why his wife left him, taking their children. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can blame the whole world,\u201d he says. \u201cI did it. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d What is clear is that he tried to help the refugees out of compassion. His own childhood was tough and he recalls seeing his older brother\u2019s face \u201crammed up against the woodchip wallpaper\u201d by his violent dad. Later, he was moved to a children\u2019s home. \u201cI always think \u2018I wish I could have been rescued,\u2019\u201d he says. Now, Lawrie is still bringing aid to refugees and has Hollywood producers interested in his story, but the real tragedy is that there is no happy ending for Bahar. \u201cThe ironic thing is that when I\u00a0came out of court I went to pick Bahar up \u2013 and her dad \u2013 and on the way back I had to drop them back at the camp,\u201d says Lawrie. He was free to go home and have a bath. That little girl is still in Calais.",
