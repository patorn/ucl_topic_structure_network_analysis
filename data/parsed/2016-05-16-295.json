  "body": "By 2018 every employee in the UK aged between 22 and pension age, earning \u00a310,000 or more per year, will be automatically enrolled into a workplace pension. It\u2019s part of the government\u2019s auto-enrolment policy, that is being implemented in stages since October 2012. How much will it cost charity employers? From April 2019, staff at even the smallest charity will see 8% of their eligible earnings (currently from \u00a35,824 to \u00a343,000, before tax) go into a pension pot. Employers are legally obliged to pay in at least 3% of that 8% (with staff making up the remaining 4% with 1% as tax relief). So how are charities responding?   Related: Charity pensions: how to defuse the billion-pound timebomb    Fiona Terry, head of human resources at Samaritans, says that on top of the 3%, the charity will match up to 5% of contributions from employees. \u201cSo if they want to contribute 1% [of their salary] we will match this and will similarly match 2%, 3%, 4% and 5%. \u201cStaff are welcome to contribute more, but we cannot go any higher [than 5%],\u201d she says. \u201cA few have opted out \u2013 mainly those on lower wages. A few are paying in more.\u201d Macmillan, meanwhile, said it would eventually match employees up to 7.5%, but will be aiming for an equal 4% split by 2018.  According to Andrew O\u2019Brien, head of policy and engagement at the Charity Finance Group, this 7.5% figure doesn\u2019t look dissimilar to what charities might have to offer in the future. \u201c[The] government is looking to ramp up employers\u2019 minimum contributions,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Australia they are already paying 9%.\u201d  What to consider It\u2019s important to find out the terms of the pension into which you will be auto-enrolling staff, the fund\u2019s potential returns, and how the scheme is financially rated. A fund\u2019s ethical credentials may also be of interest, and there are often a number of options regarding the types of investments the money can be used for.  Staff wishing to opt out, or choose their own pension provider, are able to do so. However, O\u2019Brien says, employers are not obliged to contribute to a staff member\u2019s own choice of pension. If they do, setting up the payments can be administratively complicated.  Employees who earn less than \u00a310,000 can still ask to be enrolled in the firm\u2019s pension scheme, and employers must comply. But they do not have to contribute if the staff member earns less than \u00a35,824 \u2013 although, again, they can choose to do so. Freelancers, casual staff and temporary staff can be a grey area. In general, those with a contract who aren\u2019t self-employed and earn more than \u00a3833 a month should be auto-enrolled into the charity\u2019s pension scheme.   Which pensions providers are charities using? Most charity employers are joining multi-employer schemes such as the Pensions Trust and the National Employment Savings Trust (Nest). Both are not-for-profit options and, like most pensions nowadays, offer defined contributions rather than defined benefits \u2013 ie the payouts you receive on retirement are dependent on factors such as the amount you pay in, fluctuations in performance of the investment, and the economy. (A defined benefit pension promises a specific income.) In the private sector, Aviva currently sits at the top of ShareAction\u2019s responsible investment chart (pdf) and is used by charities including the School for Social Entrepreneurs. ShareAction, set up as a charity to encourage more ethical investing, opted forNest as its provider, which is at number five on its chart. \u201cAviva are indeed doing very strongly, particularly on climate change,\u201d says Grace Hetherington, spokesperson for the charity. But the team decided to go with Nest, as the not-for-profit, more cost-effective option, she says. \u201cWe were impressed with their strong member communications, robust responsible investment policy and transparency of voting practices.\u201d Nest also offers ethical and Sharia compliant options among others, which limit the companies and sectors the money can be invested into. Its mainstream fund prohibits investment in the most controversial weapons, such as landmines. An employer can also set up its own pension trust and have more flexibility over its offering, which the RSPB has done. The charity has since been able to address its future deficit of \u00a386.5m by closing the final salary section to new entrants, increasing staff contribution rates, and passing on part of future cost increases to pension scheme members.  The Samaritans says it looked extensively at the available options and chose The People\u2019s Pension (TPP), a not-for-profit scheme with three million members. This plan is ranked at 11 on ShareAction\u2019s chart of auto-enrolment pension providers, scoring four points out of a possible 80, compared with Aviva\u2019s 39 and Nest\u2019s 27.  The Samaritans\u2019 head of human resources, Fiona Terry, says:  \u201cAll staff following our staging date are auto-rolled with TPP. We spent an extensive amount of time weighing up the options, looking at returns and ethics of various schemes and found TPP to be the best option.\u201d For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, join our community \u2013 it\u2019s free!",
