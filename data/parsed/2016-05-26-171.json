  "body": "The slow rollback of South America\u2019s \u201cpink tide\u201d is laying bare the endemic corruption that was hidden beneath the economic success once enjoyed by the region\u2019s progressive governments. Voted out in democratic elections in Argentina, expelled by what almost conclusively looks like a palace coup in Brazil or tottering on the brink of social meltdown in Venezuela, a league of like-minded progressive presidents has been broken apart in the space of six months. The ingrained habit of palm-greasing across the continent has suddenly erupted from below the surface, leading to wide-ranging court investigations, especially in Brazil and Argentina, that seem to be shaking the foundations of the social conquests made by the left-leaning politicians now in retreat around the continent. Forged by decades of opposition against an entrenched economic elite they imagined to have finally toppled, the region\u2019s progressive leaders are now seeing that old rival \u2013 a right-leaning and mostly white patriarchy \u2013 march triumphantly back into office. At stake is the survival of the badly needed welfare benefits put in place during their administrations, either because they contradict the free-market policies of the new incumbents or because the painful end of the commodities boom that once propped them up has rendered them unsustainable. Although it is a continent-wide swing, there is an especially strong sense of deja vu in the recent and almost synchronous move to the right in Brazil and Argentina, welded at the waist as the two South American giants are by their interlocking economies. Both countries endured lengthy military dictatorships in the 1960s and 70s. They then made an almost parallel transition to democracy in the 1980s. In the 1990s, they both veered right to launch free-market economic programmes that reduced their dizzying inflation rates for a period, a success that ultimately proved hollow. By the turn of the century, a new bout of spiralling prices and maxi-devaluations crippled both economies once again. Then in 2003, disenchanted with their failed dalliance with liberal economics, both turned left, voting in charismatic leaders with a populist bent who quickly delivered on their promise of a new economic deal that empowered the working class instead of continuing to fatten the traditional upper crust. Brazil\u2019s Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Argentina\u2019s N\u00e9stor Kirchner saw their region\u2019s exports to China skyrocket during their terms, creating a favourable economic wind that allowed them to reduce their dependence on foreign credit, lifting millions out of poverty while they turned a cold shoulder to Washington, attributing to the US imperial intentions rather than neighbourly feelings.

Photograph: David Fernandez/EPA    They were soon standing side by side instead with Venezuela\u2019s anti-US Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, awash in petrodollars that he generously spread around to bankroll his dream of a \u201cBolivarian revolution\u201d, and with Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro, honorary figurehead of the left-leaning alliance. For a moment, Lula and N\u00e9stor, universally known at home by their first names, backed by Ch\u00e1vez, seemed to put South America on the brink of a bright socialist dawn. For the many South Americans who voted them into office, it was a heady experience that was in tune with the 1970s dream of \u201cliberation\u201d, cruelly drowned in blood by the continent\u2019s murderous generals. But, unlike those failed utopias, the new \u201cpink tide\u201d really did reduce the region\u2019s hated foreign economic dependence and seemed to mercifully end the long dominance of local elites. When three women cast from the same ideological mould, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez in Argentina, Dilma Rousseff in Brazil and Michelle Bachelet in Chile, followed as South America\u2019s first elected female presidents, the dream seemed complete. Complete, yet unrealistic, an ironic observer might add. But is that true? The wave of populist governments failed to manage wisely the commodities windfall they enjoyed. They did not diversify their economies or stack up reserves to weather the inevitable crash. But the condition of their economies upon leaving office, with the cataclysmic exception of Venezuela, is nowhere near the state of economic chaos left behind by the region\u2019s disastrous free-market experiments of the 1990s. In Bolivia, Evo Morales, the country\u2019s first indigenous president, has proved that socio-economic reforms that reduce inequality don\u2019t always crush the economy. The populist governments also ushered in a series of forward-looking reforms: gay marriage rights in four countries, including Brazil and Argentina; abortion and the legalisation of marijuana in Uruguay, where Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez of the progressive Frente Amplio (Broad Front) party was reelected only last year.     Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, has been named in the Panama Papers. Photograph: Eitan Abramovich/AFP/Getty Images    N\u00e9stor Kirchner and his wife, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who succeeded him in office, may very well be remembered as much by the scale of their corruption as for their social programmes. But the witch-hunt against their wrongdoing currently under way in Argentina\u2019s courts entirely misses the elephant in the room \u2013 the uncomfortable fact that Argentina\u2019s entire political establishment is rotten to the core, from left to right and back again. Almost as if to prove the point, Argentina\u2019s new centre-right president, Mauricio Macri, had barely assumed office when his name popped up in the files of the international Panama Papers financial scandal. The same applies to Brazil. The revelations brought to light by the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation suggest a scale of corruption so epic it makes even the Kirchners pale by comparison. But the recent right-leaning \u201csoft coup\u201d that unseated Rousseff was perpetrated by legislators who for the largest part were at the receiving end of that corruption. About 60% of the 594 members of Brazil\u2019s Congress face charges ranging from bribery to homicide. And wiretaps revealed by the press this week strongly suggest that Rousseff was ousted not as part of any anti-graft crusade, but precisely to squash the investigation into Brazil\u2019s mind-boggling corruption, an investigation that Rousseff did not attempt to block. In the end, South America\u2019s progressive alliance crumbled not because it was ideologically unsound, but because it was built on the same feet of clay as its conservative nemeses. Corruption is a trait sadly common across the region\u2019s entire political spectrum.",
