  "body": "The family of the woman who inspired Titty in Arthur Ransome\u2019s Swallows and Amazons have hit out at plans to switch the dinghy-loving character\u2019s name to \u201cTatty\u201d in a new film adaptation. BBC Films announced in 2011 that it was planning a new take on the classic Lake District-set children\u2019s story, with the aim of capturing the imagination of the Harry Potter generation. The first movie in a planned series \u2013 Ransome wrote 12 books \u2013 will be in cinemas later this year.   Related: Swallows and Amazons: the new Harry Potter?    Barbara Altounyan, niece of Mavis \u201cTitty\u201d Altounyan (later Guzelian), told the Telegraph her aunt would be \u201cturning in her grave\u201d and said the family were \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d the name of Ransome\u2019s real-life inspiration had been changed. \u201cI would absolutely wring someone\u2019s neck if could only find out whose neck I could wring,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the most disgustingly pompous thing to do, to feel you can change somebody\u2019s identity without any permission or discussion.\u201d Altounyan, daughter of the real-life Titty\u2019s younger brother Roger, said the name change \u201cruns the risk of leaving audiences ignorant of the innocence and charm of Arthur Ransome\u2019s children\u2019s novel\u201d. Her late aunt, she said, was a \u201cvery well-educated person who knew something of the world\u201d and \u201cwould be so angry to be called Tatty\u201d. In a letter to the Telegraph, Altounyan described the move as \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, which would have \u201cinsulted\u201d her aunt. She said she had attempted to contact the new film\u2019s producers but had made \u201cno impact whatsoever\u201d. Mavis Altounyan was the inspiration for one of the four Walker children featured in Ransome\u2019s novels, along with her brother John (the eldest and captain of the Swallows), Susan (mate) and Roger (ship\u2019s boy). The Amazons of the title are the Blackett sisters Nancy (captain) and Peggy (mate). Ransome met the Altounyans while holidaying in the Lake District. Sophie Neville, who played Titty Walker in the 1974 film adaptation of Swallows and Amazons and is the current president of the Arthur Ransome Society, said she had mixed feelings about the name change. \u201cPeople still call me Titty to my face. Over the past 43 years there have never been any problems. Fan mail has never stopped arriving. I find it charming,\u201d she said. \u201cThe British public have a huge warmth and affection for Titty, which I think has been underestimated. There is even a #TittyForever hashtag. \u201cOn the other hand, as someone who\u2019s been involved with the new film adaptation, I appreciate that the movie has to attract audiences worldwide. I know that all Arthur Ransome enthusiasts would love to see films made of the other books in the series such as Peter Duck, Winter Holiday and Missee Lee. For these to be financed we need to think about the reaction of international audiences. We might have to pay the price by changing Titty\u2019s name.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Mavis Altounyan\u2019s nickname has been changed for the screen. The BBC\u2019s 1963 version of Swallows and Amazons referred to the character as Kitty.",
