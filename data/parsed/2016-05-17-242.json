It famously chronicled Bob Dylan\u2019s pivotal 1965 tour of England and his transformation from a polite leading light of the marginal folk scene into an incendiary figure in the cultural mainstream.  \u201cVery few people change the way of the world,\u201d says Baldassare. \u201cTo me there is before Elvis and after Elvis, before Cassius Clay and after Muhammad Ali, and before Bob Dylan and after Bob Dylan. In Don\u2019t Look Back we have the rare vantage point of seeing that moment just before.\u201d   Related: Do look back: a new golden age for the music documentary    Shot handheld on black-and-white 16mm film, Don\u2019t Look Back invented the \u201crockumentary\u201d. Its fly-on-the-wall style flew in the face of contemporary cinematic convention, and its reputation and influence has steadily grown since its release in 1967. In 2014, the British Film Institute\u2019s authoritative poll of movie industry experts ranked Don\u2019t Look Back as one of the 10 best documentaries of all time. Since the mid-1950s Pennebaker had been a pioneer of the observational \u201cdirect cinema\u201d style, and had even helped develop the small synchronised sound and vision system which enabled it. While making films for Life magazine, he was looking for a more personal project when he met Bob Dylan in a bar in Greenwich Village. \u201cHe [Dylan] said: I have an idea for a film where I write out all the words to this song on pieces of paper, and I\u2019ll just throw them down as I read them,\u201d Pennebaker recalls. \u201cI said: that\u2019s a fantastic idea.\u201d This eventually became the famous Subterranean Homesick Blues \u201cvideo\u201d (actually the opening sequence in Don\u2019t Look Back).         Bob Dylan \u2013 Subterranean Homesick Blues    Pennebaker was not attracted to Dylan because he was a celebrity \u2013 in fact, quite the opposite. \u201cI was interested in real people and why they did things, or how they did things. And the only way to find that out was to follow them,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him [Dylan] that well, I didn\u2019t know who he was really. But the idea of going with a musician on a tour and being able to photograph him \u2013 both when he performed and when he didn\u2019t perform \u2013 that seemed to me an interesting idea.\u201d    Dylan is constantly creating himself, and then standing back and trying to witness it    So did this idea turn out? \u201cDylan is an interesting person to watch because he is constantly creating himself, and then standing back and trying to witness it,\u201d says Pennebaker with typical understatement. The movie is mesmeric: while it features spellbinding snatches of a musician performing at the height of his powers, the off-stage drama is just as enthralling. Arriving in England, Dylan is all politeness and charm in the face of a media circus intent on turning him into an easy-to-understand cardboard cutout. But as the chaotic tour wears on, he becomes increasingly abrasive and angry, mercilessly mocking a backstage interloper and demeaning a reporter from Time magazine.

I mean, people make up their own mind about what he is like from watching the film and that\u2019s OK. I can\u2019t change that,\u201d says Pennebaker, who didn\u2019t find Dylan at all difficult to work with. \u201cHe was very easy, we got along fine. I mean, we\u2019re still partners.\u201d Despite being shot in black and white over half a century ago, Don\u2019t Look Back still looks contemporary. It was certainly way ahead of its time in the 1960s. \u201cThe people who distributed films didn\u2019t even want to look at it,\u201d says Pennebaker. \u201cFor them, films were made with people who were very well known, celebrities \u2026 The way they were filmed was always in perfect clothes, perfect surroundings, and whenever they spoke the voices were perfectly heard. It was hard. We distributed it ourselves, we couldn\u2019t get a distributor.\u201d     Bob Dylan in Don\u2019t Look Back. Photograph: Channel 4 picture publicity    Having left the corporate structure of Life magazine, Pennebaker had no production funding for Don\u2019t Look Back. \u201cIf you\u2019re only one person and you\u2019re shooting with a camera that you built yourself, it\u2019s not so expensive,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need a crew. You didn\u2019t need lights because the film was pretty fast. You didn\u2019t need any extra things. You didn\u2019t have to have big studios and expensive makeup and all the things that Hollywood had put on to the films, because they weren\u2019t necessary. And that\u2019s what I did, and that\u2019s what we still do.\u201d   Related: The night Bob Dylan abandoned me at a petrol station    Pennebaker is still making films in his signature style with his directing partner Chris Hegedus, and the influence of his earlier work is still being felt across the spectrum of moving image. With Monterey Pop, Pennebaker practically invented the concert film at a 1967 festival featuring Janis Joplin, The Who and a guitar-burning Jimi Hendrix. 1993\u2019s The War Room, which followed Bill Clinton\u2019s election campaign, became a blueprint not only for subsequent documentaries but also for dramas (such as The Thick of It and Veep). In 2012, an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement was awarded \u201cto DA Pennebaker, who redefined the language of film and taught a generation of film makers to look to reality for inspiration\u201d. The Don\u2019t Look Back exhibition at New York\u2019s Morrison Hotel Gallery breaks yet more new ground for Pennebaker, as it includes new photographs made from stills from the film. \u201cThe moments before a performer takes the stage, they navigate a wave of reflection, preparing for what is about to take place,\u201d explains curator Baldassare, who selected the stills for the photographs. \u201cIn creating this exhibit, I looked for those moments.\u201d Pennebaker never had any intention of following in the footsteps of his father, who was a photographer. But at the age of 90 he seems happy to have done so. \u201cI never thought of myself as a photographer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut when I see these pictures I\u2019m quite impressed with how some of them have turned out.\u201d Don\u2019t Look Back exhibition is at the Morrison Hotel Gallery, 116 Prince Street, New York, 20 May to 14 June.",
