  "body": "When it was published 20 years ago, Junk was a long shot. Teenage fiction at the time was really aimed at 11 and 12-year-olds. Maybe the occasional 14-year-old might read down to it, but no one seriously thought that 15 or 16-year-olds would read it. I remember some librarians saying that they thought it was a great book, but that it\u2019s likely fate was to languish on the shelves.      Why a book about drugs? I come from one of the first generations when recreational drugs were widely available, and of course, many of us at school were very curious. There was no useful information about that world \u2013 the authorities were all saying how awful and deadly drugs were, but the Beatles and Stones seemed to be having a fairly good time. By the time I was in my 20s, drugs culture was full blown, but ignorance, officially sanctioned in law, was still the order of the day.  I was living in Bristol, in the middle of that heady, inner-city mix of sex, drugs, rock n\u2019 roll and politics. Such a seductive, exciting and dangerous world! \u2013 just the place for a story to be told. So when my publisher, Klaus Flugge of Andersen Press, suggested a book on drugs, it was to that period that my mind inevitably went.

But\u2026 what wouldn\u2019t I have given for a book set in that world when I was 15 or 16? A book not simply about the drugs themselves, but about the culture\u2026 the people, the ideas, the relationships, with all its highs and lows, all its excitements, glories and tragedies.  Why not? Fiction for young people had been moving that way for years\u2026 getting older, getting more serious, testing the waters. I was already known for hard hitting, honest books. Klaus, bless him, was up for it\u2026    It used to be Alice in Wonderland and Fluffy Bunny \u2013 now suddenly it\u2019s junkie whores rolling round in the gutter       That\u2019s what Junk was \u2013 the book I wished I\u2019d had when I was 15-years-old. It came as a surprise to me when it did so well. There was a huge amount of fuss when it won first the Guardian children\u2019s fiction award, and then the Carnegie medal \u2013 both originally awards for younger children\u2019s fiction. People on the inside knew that change was going in teenage fiction, but the press was taken completely by surprise. This is fiction for children? Help! What\u2019s going on? Where had Ratty, Toad and Moley gone? It used to be Alice in Wonderland and Fluffy Bunny \u2013 now suddenly it\u2019s junkie whores rolling round in the gutter. What happened to innocence? Above all, why are we subjecting our children to this sort of thing? I had a busy time explaining that the book was not aimed at children, but teenagers \u2013 people in possession of all their hormones and probably having a full sex life by then, even if it was usually on their own. And already thinking about, or maybe even already experimenting with, intoxicants of one form or another. Surely it was better to arrive in that world forearmed with a little knowledge, than to step out as a total naive onto the streets, as I did, ready to swallow the first bunch of lies told, either by an unscrupulous black marketeer, or by an equally unscrupulous know-all in authority, ready to tell them any amount of tosh to keep them in line?   Related: Why I've written a book for teenagers about taking drugs    These days, of course, Junk wouldn\u2019t attract anything like so much attention. Teenage fiction, or YA as it\u2019s now known, is big business. Looking back, it seems astonishing that there was no real publishing industry aimed at high school students at all in this country, or indeed most of Europe, and that a book aimed at that age group should attract so much outrage only twenty years ago, just for trying to engage with them on an authentic level. I\u2019m very proud of it. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of people who\u2019ve contacted me to tell them how important Junk has been to them \u2013 some because it helped them understand their own addiction, or the addiction of friends and family; some because it\u2019s helped them navigate their way through that perilous world; some because it struck notes deep inside; and others simply because they loved reading it.   Related: If the real world isn't censored \u2013 why should fiction be?    Junk is often called a game changer, but what difference did it really make in the long run? Well, who can tell? There are some modern European countries without much challenging YA literature \u2013 Italy is one, I\u2019m told \u2013 so it\u2019s never a forgone conclusion. But things were moving in that direction here, albeit slowly, and I suspect that the UK was always going to be a YA stronghold. It did perhaps kick-start the genre, though. Publishers had been trying for years to court the teenage market, but the general opinion was still that, \u201cThey don\u2019t read\u201d. Junk sold by the barrelful and showed that it wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t want to read \u2013 it was just that no one was publishing the right kind of material. The book attracted writers to the genre as well \u2013 any number of people have told me that they were attracted to writing YA because they loved Junk, and because it showed them just how far you could go.  Most of all though, the book opened up a debate about teenage life and teenage literature, about whether young people had the right to read honest, authentic books; about what was suitable, what was not, and whether or not our young people should be protected from the harsh realities of life, or empowered to cope with them.   Related: Why I explore rape culture in my new book for teens    I\u2019m very pleased that the empowerers won the day, hands down.  It\u2019s a great thing to get in early. Junk marks not so much a line in the sand, but the rubbing out of a line. Since then, the rules have changed utterly, and I\u2019m just delighted to have been involved in helping kick down a few doors. You can buy Junk from the Guardian bookshop.
