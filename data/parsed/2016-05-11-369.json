  "body": "The advertising watchdog has banned mobile network Three\u2019s Muppet-themed ad campaign, following a complaint from rival EE. EE, the UK\u2019s largest mobile phone company, lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority about the campaign and one strapline where Three UK claims to be the \u201cundisputed\u201d market leader. The ad features Jackson, a Muppet-like creation of Jim Henson\u2019s Creature Shop, in boxing gloves being victoriously hoisted in a Rocky-style moment of triumph. It ran with the strapline: \u201cThe undisputed. UK\u2019s most reliable network. Again.\u201d    @ThreeUK Undisputed? Not quite: https://t.co/z8KvI0HHFY  #makeitright #getitright pic.twitter.com/CGzfKJ6933\u2014 EE (@EE) November 5, 2015    EE, which took to social media posting a tweet with the dictionary definition of the word \u201cundisputed\u201d, challenged whether the ad was misleading and if Three UK could prove the claim. A member of the public also lodged a complaint with the ASA. Three UK said the ad\u2019s claims were based on a YouGov report in which it had beaten rivals in five consecutive quarters in a comparison about network reliability. The company also said that there was no standard, objective industry test for network reliability, so the best way to determine it was to ask customers. The ASA said the ad did not make it clear that the claim \u201cundisputed\u201d was in fact based on subjective consumer views, and that those who saw the ad would think it was based on \u201crobust objective measures\u201d. \u201cBecause we understood that there were no commonly agreed objective measures of network reliability against which 3 UK had undisputedly scored higher than their competitors, we concluded that the claim \u2018The undisputed\u2019 as used in the context of the ad was likely to mislead,\u201d said the ASA.  \u201cThe ad must not appear again in its current form. We also told them not to state or imply that Three was the UK\u2019s most reliable network unless they made clear that the claim was based solely on a survey of consumer opinions.\u201d A spokesman for Three UK defended the company\u2019s track record. \u201cWe have been recognised by consumers, based on their direct feedback to YouGov, as the UK\u2019s most reliable network for an incredible seven quarters in a row. Technical tests conducted by Rootmetrics have also recently named us as the most reliable network, so we are naturally surprised and disappointed by the ASA\u2019s decision. We are analysing the ruling before deciding our next step.\u201d And EE couldn\u2019t help but crow on social media about its knockout of rival 3 UK over the claim.    Hi @threeuk your undisputed claim has been disputed. The ASA says you have to #makeitright https://t.co/liTezUpjfK pic.twitter.com/NpQRJeen7Z\u2014 EE (@EE) May 11, 2016",
