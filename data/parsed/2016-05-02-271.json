  "body": "Labor has seized on reported comments by the government backbench MP John Alexander that negative gearing has helped make property unaffordable for first home buyers as evidence the tax deduction must be wound back. According to an ABC report before his appearance on Four Corners on Monday, Alexander said negative gearing had led to a housing market \u201cdominated by speculative investors\u201d.   Related: Labor's negative gearing reform proposal is economically responsible and fair    \u201cToo often we see the young couple getting beaten out at the auction and then renting out the very place that they were trying to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst home buyers have really been unable to compete.\u201d Alexander headed a parliamentary inquiry into housing affordability, which is due to report this year. The Turnbull government has ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, arguing driving down the value of Australian homes would harm growth and prosperity. Alexander had some praise for negative gearing, saying: \u201cIt has worked very well when it has provided affordable rental properties. \u201cThe moment that it intrudes on the marketplace and stops young families from buying the house, that\u2019s not ideal. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in this moment when interest rates have gotten so low.\u201d Labor\u2019s financial services and superannuation spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said in Canberra on Monday it was \u201cJohn Alexander\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Dwyer moment\u201d, in reference to her statement that Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy would drive up prices in apparent contradiction of government claims it would have the opposite effect.   Related: Government's negative gearing claims dismissed by Grattan Institute report    \u201cI mean, twice now we\u2019ve seen members of the Turnbull government completely torpedo the scare campaign, the dishonest, unhinged scare campaign that the prime minister has been proceeding with,\u201d he said. \u201cJohn Alexander can see that negative gearing is an issue that needs to be addressed.\u201d Chalmers said it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that the government was defending \u201csubsidising people who have nine or 10 or 11 investment properties when it\u2019s hard for people to get into the property market\u201d. Labor has proposed limiting negative gearing to new housing while grandfathering arrangements for investors from 1 July 2017 if elected and slashing the capital gains tax discount from 50% to 25%.
