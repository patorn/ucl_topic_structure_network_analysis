Underneath Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s face is his slogan: \u201cChange is coming.\u201d Likened to Dirty Harry, a ruthless police inspector played by Clint Eastwood, \u201cDuterte Harry\u201d has drawn scorn from rights groups who accuse him of allowing vigilantes to kill hundreds of suspected criminals.   Related: 'I'd kill my kids if they took drugs' says Philippines presidential favourite    Also known as \u201cthe Punisher\u201d, the 71-year-old who cruises his home town on a motorbike has run a presidential campaign promising to wipe out criminality within six months. The Philippines should build funeral parlours, not prisons, to cope with drug pushers in his time in office, he says. And, despite incredulity from the political establishment, polls show Duterte is likely to win Monday\u2019s election with a 10-point lead over his rivals. Recent surveys give him 33% in a system where candidates do not need a majority to win \u2013 Benigno Aquino won in 2010 with 42%. With presidents limited to one term of six years, the outgoing incumbent has made an 11th-hour attempt to block Duterte by attempting to gather candidates around his preferred successor, Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas, the grandson of a former president.  Aquino, who is credited with strong economic growth, says he has contacted the other candidates \u2013 senator Grace Poe, the former international criminal court judge Miriam Santiago and the current vice-president, Jejomar Binay \u2013 to try to stall Duterte\u2019s lead.

Photograph: Bullit Marquez/AP    The coastal city of Davao, population 1.5 million, where Duterte has been elected mayor seven times, provides perhaps the most accurate vision of how the country would be run under his leadership. His detractors say he is dangerous, but supporters laud his principled lifestyle, his modest house and support of LGBT groups, a risky political move in a mainly Catholic country. As a former prosecutor, Duterte has raised the city\u2019s standing from a haven for criminals to one of the country\u2019s safest cities. Investment and tourism are up.  \u201cThe masses dream Duterte can help,\u201d said Artemio Jim\u00e9nez, who runs one of city\u2019s largest districts, called a barangay, of 200,000 people. Sheltering from the sun under a metal awning in central Davao, he wore a blue and red wristband with \u201cDuterte\u201d written on it and a small yellow symbol of a punching fist.

Having been elected in 1994, he has worked with Duterte throughout his time as mayor and says Davao is a model for the Philippines, with \u201cpeace and order as a primary concern\u201d. When Mayor Rody, as the gun-collecting tough-talker is known locally, first took office in 1988, Davao was tagged the \u201cNicaragua of Asia\u201d. While Jim\u00e9nez denied Duterte was linked to death squads, he said the mayor had a policy of using \u201cpeace keepers\u201d \u2013 volunteers who \u201croam around during day and night\u201d and clean up the city\u2019s crime problems. \u201cDuterte doesn\u2019t want a \u2018son of a gun\u2019 or a \u2018naughty naughty\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cEven as a barangay captain, I will kill a son of a gun. Those who are thieves or rapists, if I caught them in an actual criminal offence.  \u201cWhat would you do if your sister was raped?\u201d he asked. The city, once a hotspot for fighting between communist rebels and security forces, is a bastion of support for Duterte. A survey by Ateneo de Davao University showed he has the backing of 88% of the city\u2019s voters, while percentages for the rest of the presidential candidates were \u201cinsignificant\u201d.

His son is already vice-mayor. \u201cThey idolise him,\u201d says Amado Picardal, a priest who has spent the past two decades documenting death squad attacks, which he says have killed 1,424 people, 132 of them minors.  The former spokesperson of Davao\u2019s Coalition Against Summary Execution said a Duterte presidency \u201cwould be a period of great uncertainty and instability\u201d.  \u201cHis programme would be the elimination of criminality. At the core of this is the use of extrajudicial killings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was already done in Davao, the so-called peace and order. It will continue.\u201d In 2009, Human Rights Watch released a report calling for the Philippines to dismantle highly organised vigilante gangs it said were directly linked to government officials and police.

Photograph: Ezra Acayan/Reuters    The victims, many of them petty criminals or street children, were killed by men in baseball caps who rode motorbikes with no licence plates. Targets were often warned in advance by police that their names were on a list. The mayor had warned that criminals were a \u201clegitimate target of assassination\u201d and Human Rights Watch said some victims had been killed after Duterte himself announced their names on local television. Duterte has at times denied links to death squads while also making contradictory statements that he either condones or is even part of the vigilante group. Residents have brushed off criticism, saying Duterte distributed policing power to local communities. A merchant mariner said Davao\u2019s Muslim, Christian and indigenous populations were allowed to \u201cdeal with their own problems, including criminals\u201d to prevent sectarian anger from outside interference. He said criminals finally got the message when syndicate figures were shot dead immediately after their release from prison. Another resident, 53-year-old Pedro Corsiga, said \u201cbefore there was criminality, a lot of chaos in the city\u201d. He sat in a car park in Davao with other supporters of Duterte who wore T-shirts bearing the message \u201cNo to drugs. No to criminality. No to corruption\u201d. Duterte is popular nationwide because many like his quick-fix promises to deal with the country\u2019s problems. Slow-pace reform has led to distrust of the political elite. For example, the other four candidates, all of them measured politicians, have proposed detailed policies to deal with a territorial dispute with Beijing over atolls in the South China Sea.  Mayor Duterte, instead, has promised to jet-ski to a contested island and raise the flag of the Philippines.         Duterte: \u2018Change is coming.\u2019    But most worrying for Duterte\u2019s opponents are his threats to abolish congress or create a revolutionary government. As with many of his statements, it was not clear if the comments were in made in jest or seriousness, causing ripples of fear in a country that pride itself on ousting late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Tom Pepinsky, a south-east Asia analyst at Cornell University, says Duterte\u2019s popularity suggests \u201che will not face opposition to a more vigorous law-and-order campaign\u201d. Pepinsky warns: \u201cThe parallels to Ferdinand Marcos, who also was elected in democratic elections and exploited elite and middle-class distress about chronic political instability in the early 1970s before declaring martial law, are troubling.\u201d Yet Duterte is harder to define than the caricature his profanity-laced public speeches present. Data from Davao city hall, where Duterte has surrounded himself with technocrats and policy wonks, show imports and exports rising and tourist arrivals doubling since 2010. His campaign team says behind Duterte\u2019s rough campaign speeches there is a team of thoughtful policymakers. Eurasia Group, a global risk research firm, said Duterte is likely to develop infrastructure. When arriving at Davao airport, flight crew remind passengers it is a no-smoking city, the first in the country, and Davao was also the first Philippine city to operate an effective 911 call centre. Known to drive a taxi incognito around Davao, Duterte converted a large villa into a live-in chemotherapy centre as hospitals were too crowded for patient\u2019s families to stay for long periods of time. His demagogic rise has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump, but Duterte considers the latter a bigot. And in 2012 the mayor passed landmark legislation for an office he set up to expand support for LGBT rights.   Related: Philippines presidential candidate apologises for comments on Australian rape victim    Lorna Mandin, the officer in charge of the department deep inside city hall, said the mayor heard the LGBT community was suffering and leaned on the \u201ctraditionally conservative\u201d city council to pass the anti-discrimination law. \u201cHe has a human rights perspective,\u201d Mandin said as her colleagues wrote women\u2019s rights slogans on large placards, their latest education drive. Key to the programme is Norman Baloro, a public servant who runs an annual Christmas pageant for the LGBT community where partygoers dress up \u201cas Cinderella or Barbie\u201d. Duterte attends every year, Baloro says, and also provides gifts for the raffle. \u201cHe gave 100 televisions, 150 cellphones, rice cookers, gas stoves,\u201d Baloro said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want the LGBT community left behind.\u201d Local love has gone national, with Duterte\u2019s poll numbers far ahead of Poe, a businesswoman who has run her campaign on economic policy. She and Aquino\u2019s favourite, Roxas, are tied second in polls. The mayor\u2019s imminent entry to high office has led to warnings from senior politicians of an overthrow. When Senator Antonio Trillanes, a former navy officer who led two failed mutinies, was asked if Duterte\u2019s win could lead to a return to coup plots, he replied: \u201cLet\u2019s just say it\u2019s found to be very easy to recruit people for such military intervention and I believe people will be longing and clamouring for that.\u201d And on Wednesday Aquino had warned that the country\u2019s hard-earned democracy was under threat. \u201cNow that we are free,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople who act like dictators are the ones in the lead.\u201d",
