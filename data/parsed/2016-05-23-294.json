  "body": "Kurt Wallander is visiting a fellow Swede at the charity programme he runs for young offenders outside Cape Town. This is the English adaptation of Wallander (BBC1, Sunday), the Kenneth Branagh one, back after a few years for three final cases. Axel Hedeman\u2019s wife has been missing for 10 days. \u201cWhat do you do for them?\u201d Wallander asks, about the youths. \u201cGym, soccer, some kind of male role model,\u201d says Axel. \u201cAnd your wife, what did, er \u2026?\u201d \u201cInga, she\u2019s a teacher.\u201d Did you spot it? The change in tense? What do you do, and what did she do. Wallander doesn\u2019t give much away, but he doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s alive. And you don\u2019t want Wallander thinking your wife isn\u2019t alive, unless, of course, you don\u2019t want her to be alive. In spite of the suspicions of the local police, I\u2019m not convinced Axel does want Inga to be dead, or that he killed her or had her killed. She\u2019s a teacher, he says, present tense. He may not be perfect, but he still thinks \u2013 and hopes\u00a0\u2013 that he\u2019s going to see her again. Wallander only came to South Africa to make a speech at a conference, but you know him \u2013 he can\u2019t help getting involved. Am I imagining it, or is it because there has been a fresh batch of miserable, northern sleuths (Icelandic Andri in Trapped, most notably) since Ken\u2019s Wallander was last on the screen, but has Kurt mellowed? He still doesn\u2019t give much away, through that not-quite-horizontal crack of a mouth, but there\u2019s an almost friendly twinkle about him. More than a hint of warmth on a video call to his daughter. And with Grace, the local cop. And at a party at her house \u2026 So, maybe not quite the life and soul \u2013 he\u2019s not doing the conga \u2013 but he\u2019s at least saying hello to everyone, more awkward and shy than full-on Nordic misery. When these last three are done, is he going to retire happily, a doting grandad pushing his granddaughter on\u00a0a swing? I doubt it, somehow. The case becomes more complicated and more intriguing, with roots that spread down into the country\u2019s past. Inga\u2019s disappearance is tied up in history, politics, gangs, mercenaries, dodgy property developments and corruption in an emerging nation. Wherever Kurt goes, the buzzing flies are a signal that a body \u2013 or bits of one\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is about to show up. Including Inga\u2019s, in a water tank at a deserted military base. See, Wallander was right; he generally is. Respect to the person in charge of locations, incidentally \u2013 they\u2019re fabulous: an old farm that looks like trouble, and is, with a whining wind turbine and a gate that creaks in the wind; big landscapes, big skies; a township bar that contrasts with a smart, air-conditioned hotel, where whites laugh and drink loudly. Not just a backdrop of physical beauty, but one that says something as well. I was right, too (I\u2019m generally not). It\u00a0wasn\u2019t Axel whodunnit. The answer is more interesting, and more in keeping with the location. I love the way Wallander figures out who\u2019s behind it all; don\u2019t keep peacocks if you\u2019re a criminal, that\u2019s one message to take away. I love it all, until Wallander finally delivers the speech he went there to give in the first place. \u201cDo we make a difference?\u201d he says to assembled delegates. \u201cMaybe. Sometimes. Not much. What I do know is that we should never stop trying. We need to remember that every little counts \u2026\u201d Every little counts! From the (thin) lips of\u00a0our Sir Ken, that\u2019s not right, is it? Not just dodgy grammatically, and uncharacteristically sentimental, but it\u2019s hard not to think of a well-known supermarket. After that subtle tense change earlier, too. What is this, Nordic noir the Tesco way? There\u2019s more schmaltz from a knighted thesp in David Jason\u2019s narration of World Cup 1966: Alfie\u2019s Boys (BBC2, Sunday). But hey, it\u2019s 50 years, and the last time \u2013 the only time\u00a0\u2013 we won anything; a little nostalgia is permitted. A lot of them are here, too, lovely old heroes, reminiscing: Sir Bobby C, Sir Geoff H, Jimmy G, Gordon B, Jack C. No Sir Alfie, of course, or Sir Bobby M, but here\u2019s Mrs Moore, Tina, representing the family. Perhaps there are some lessons for the current lot, off to France next month. Roy should have elocution lessons, and be more aloof, especially with the press. The players need to be stripped of their money and their egos. Cancel the special plane, put them on the train to Dover \u2013 they can take the ferry. Once there, they should be highly suspicious of all foreigners, and fiercely patriotic. That should do the trick. And then, when they\u2019ve won it, they can go home and mow the lawn.",
