A film, more than 20 years in the making, that\u2019s been stalled by vanishing funds, flash floods and disease. Yet Terry Gilliam is again pushing The Man Who Killed Don Quixote up the hill. The director\u2019s treasured adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s book has seen years of false starts. A who\u2019s-who of acting talent have been attached to play the arrogant, dreamy Don (Jean Roquefort, Robert Duvall, John Hurt) and an approximation of his staunch squire Sancho Panza (Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor, Jack O\u2019Connell). All departed, for reasons ranging from the dull (Depp\u2019s been too busy making films for Disney) to the life-changing (Hurt was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year, just as the film entered another round of pre-production). The most famous mis-fire, which starred Depp and Roquefort, was chronicled in the 2002 documentary Lost in La Mancha. The tagline for the doc read \u201cThey\u2019ve got a story, but have lost the plot\u201d.            Whisper it, so fate doesn\u2019t hear, but this time, the eighth time, it looks like Gilliam will finally get Quixote made. He\u2019s at the Cannes film festival to tell the world that the production is back in the saddle. He\u2019s got his actors (Adam Driver, Michael Palin, Olga Kurylenko) and he\u2019s got a financier (Amazon Studios). He will start shooting in October. He hopes to bring the finished film to next year\u2019s Cannes, only a decade or so late. \u201cQuixote is a disease,\u201d says Gilliam, who has arrived at the five-star Carlton hotel in ebullient mood, dressed in sandals (no socks) and a beach shirt. \u201cI want to get it out of my life so I can get on with the rest of my life. It\u2019s one of those nightmares that will never leave you until you actually kill the thing.\u201d He talks the press through the new incarnation. The time-travel narrative that was originally proposed has gone. This Quixote will be set solely in the 21st century with Driver playing Toby, a TV ad director who gets mistaken for Sancho Panza by a mad actor (Palin, Gilliam\u2019s fellow former Monty Python member) who starred in Toby\u2019s film about Cervantes\u2019s knight 10 years earlier and hasn\u2019t been able to shake himself of the conviction that he is the real Quixote since. The film, says Gilliam, is partly inspired by the madness of film-making, specifically his guilt over the toll that regular folk often have to pay when a film production ravages their town. \u201cIt\u2019s very much about the danger of films, what they do to people and communities when you go and shoot there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my exposing a lot of the guilt I feel for some of the things that happened during filming in Scotland for Monty Python and the Holy Grail. \u201cAll of us came up from London. Local girls and local guys got wrapped up in the business and then, at the end of it all, you realise that marriages have broken up, people are pregnant, people go back to London and they\u2019re trailed by love affairs that didn\u2019t end. I thought, \u2018God. We kind of fucked up a lot of lives there!\u2019\u201d     Michelle Yeoh and Terry Gilliam at the premiere of Julieta in Cannes. Photograph: Gisela Schober/Getty Images    Driver \u2013 also at Cannes, with Jim Jarmusch\u2019s new film, Paterson \u2013 is, according to Gilliam, \u201cthe guy I\u2019ve been looking for all these years\u201d. He\u2019s been emailing the director about the project regularly, picking through the book (the only one of Gilliam\u2019s stars who has bothered) and suggesting bits that could be included. Gilliam appreciates Driver\u2019s passion. His celebrity doesn\u2019t hurt either. \u201cThank God for Star Wars,\u201d says Gilliam. \u201cAdam Driver is bankable! He can get us the money we need!\u201d He does feel for him though. Apparently, the actor is finding super-fame frustrating. \u201cHe\u2019s living in London at the moment and can\u2019t go out,\u201d Gilliam says. \u201cHe says it\u2019s terrible. He\u2019s very tall, so it\u2019s like [John] Cleese \u2013 it\u2019s very hard for him to hide\u201d. As for Palin, it will be his fifth collaboration with Gilliam. Their first was on Jabberwocky, Gilliam\u2019s first crack at directing a live action film solo. Their last might well be Quixote. \u201cHe\u2019s got to get on the horse, wield a lance \u2013 all this shit,\u201d says Gilliam. \u201cAnd he\u2019s 73! It may be our last big adventure together.\u201d The other Pythons are unlikely to make an appearance (\u201cMike\u2019s the nice one, the others are impossible\u201d), besides Gilliam doesn\u2019t want Quixote to be a Monty Python film. It\u2019s too close to his heart for that. He cares about it deeply. Perhaps that\u2019s why he\u2019s always believed, despite the urban myth that the project is cursed, that he could always make this film. \u201cThe curse is bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a good story and I like it. It\u2019s just not what\u2019s really going on. But I\u2019m like Trump, I\u2019ll do anything for headlines.\u201d \u201cPeople used to say I\u2019m Don Quixote, because I\u2019m a fantasist and a dreamer,\u201d he says. \u201cI go up against reality, fail and do it again. But I don\u2019t think I am Quixote. I think I\u2019m Sancho Panza. Don Quixote is the film and I\u2019m following it.\u201d",
