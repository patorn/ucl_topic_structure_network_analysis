  "body": "According to your report, there will be a machine that lip-reads (Read my lips? One day soon, a machine could do it, 25 April). The myth that lip-reading solves deaf people\u2019s problems and makes us into hearing people simply will not go away, since our culture keeps the hidden disability of deafness right where it is. Lip-reading is not an exact science, but is mostly sheer guesswork, based on working out from the conversation\u2019s context, facial expression, body language and visemes, or shapes that can be seen on the lips. We are pretty certain this machine will blow up with the same frustration we deaf people have in trying to make sense of the extremely limiting shapes on the mouth which form the so called art of lip-reading. In addition to the examples given in your report, regarding words beginning with b, m and p, there are many other words that look similar on the lips. These are some examples: t, d, n \u2013 town, down, noun; ch, sh, j \u2013 chew, shoe, Jew; q, w \u2013 quell, well; f, v \u2013 fear, veer. Some of the hidden sounds that come from the throat are: g, t, c, ck, x, h, l, r, s, z, ing, ed. This is a sample of the difficulties faced daily by lip-readers which DEXperience calls \u201calways calculate\u201d, as it is like doing a crossword without a pen to hand. Why there has to be a machine of this\u00a0nature begs belief, when efforts and funding should be put to much better use by ensuring all parents of deaf\u00a0children understand that lip-reading and technical aids are insufficient, and hold back their deaf child\u2019s wellbeing and educational opportunities. British Sign Language needs to be enshrined in law as one of the UK\u2019s languages and its promotion alongside English and Welsh in education will give\u00a0deaf people\u00a0the best of both worlds, and\u00a0celebrates being deaf.Jill JonesChair, Deaf Ex-Mainstreamers\u2019 Group Ltd/DEXperience \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
