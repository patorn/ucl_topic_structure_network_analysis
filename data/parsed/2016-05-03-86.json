  "body": "All Guy Westlake wanted to do was wash your underwear. And your shirts, and sheets and skirts and suits. His Lavanda app, launched in London two years ago, would do it all seamlessly, efficiently, affordably. About 20 minutes after you hit the wash button, a Lavanda Pro arrived to collect your load. Using their own washing machine or a dry cleaner, they would return your stuff at a time of your choosing. It was, Westlake told excited investors and journalists, \u201cUber for laundry\u201d. What happened next may sound familiar to would-be moguls piling into an Uber-inspired gold rush with wide eyes and iPhones for spades. The Mayfair meeting rooms of venture capitalists are echoing with the same phrase: \u201cIt\u2019s Uber for ...\u201d Takeaway, haircuts, parking, handymen, cleaners, massage, couriers, supply teachers, barmen, postage \u2013 think of a service, and if someone hasn\u2019t invented an Uber for it, they\u2019re probably working on it. On-demand apps pair consumers with workers to provide a service, silently and automatically doing the work that, in the case of Uber, it would take a minicab office the size of the Pentagon to achieve. That efficiency \u2013 and the typically self-employed status of the workers \u2013 means they can grow at speed. Deliveroo, the Uber for food delivery, deployed an army of wobbly cyclists using the same model. Three years after its launch, the London-based firm has more than 5,000 riders in 60 cities across Europe and Asia. It also means we are starting to use our phones as bells to command enough staff to make Lord Grantham blush. In this new, digital service era, Uber gave us the chauffeurs; it is now worth as much as $65bn (\u00a350bn), and operates in 400 cities. For aspiring entrepreneurs, these numbers are worth digging for. \u201cTen years ago, everyone was trying to build the Facebook for X,\u201d says Jordan Poulton, co-founder of the Makers Academy, a heavily oversubscribed east London coding school. \u201cNow it\u2019s the Uber for X, and the difference is that the ideas are usually better.\u201d But there are signs that the gold is running low, or at least losing its lustre, as startups with virtual shopfronts collide with cold reality. Last month, Valk Fleet, an \u201cUber for fast food\u201d, which delivered for Burger King and other outlets, went into administration. The margins on Whoppers were just too small. In the US, Spoonrocket, a meal delivery service, also went under. Figures are hard to come by in the wild west of on-demand, but tech blogs report almost weekly on services that are struggling to grow and stay cheap while satisfying customers and workers. As US investors begin, according to some reports, to plough less into on-demand apps, there are big questions about the future. \u201cHere is what we are witnessing,\u201d the influential New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo declared last month. \u201cThe end of the on-demand dream.\u201d But is he right?     Lavanda ... a hit at first.    Lavanda was a hit at first. At its peak, the company had 3,000 customers, but the spin cycle soon began to falter as it hit one problem after another. There was competition from Zipjet, which had big-money backing. Customer service was critical but, while digitally hailing a taxi in seconds remains a thrill, \u201cgetting shirts back clean can only be so exciting, and customers only responded when something went wrong\u201d, says Westlake. \u201cIf we turned up after 27 minutes instead of 22, they were demanding a refund and holding us hostage on social media.\u201d Westlake also needed a workforce big enough to meet spikes in demand, which carries the risk of idle workers. \u201cThe cost of that redundant capacity is overpowering, so you need expensive tech and algorithms to combat it,\u201d he says. Fred Destin, a London venture capitalist who has pumped millions into Deliveroo, says the service has algorithms to predict the weather. \u201cIf it rains, demand for takeaway goes way up just as the number of riders showing up goes down,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we predict rain, we figure out how many to ask to show up. And if doesn\u2019t rain, it\u2019s like: Oh shit, we have too many riders.\u201d Infrastructure \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 also became a problem for Lavanda. Westlake began using industrial laundries, but they weren\u2019t geared for the digital age, so he looked\u00a0for a site on which he could build a\u00a0hi-tech plant of his own. \u201cWe found one but\u00a0the landlord decided to sell rather than lease to a startup,\u201d he says. With the requirement to grow quickly but no way or place to do it, Westlake pulled the plug last\u00a0September. There is a happy ending to the Lavanda story (keep reading), but failure is not unusual. And it can hit the heart as well as the pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing a love,\u201d says Mike Rosam, a\u00a0rugby player turned engineer. In 2012, he quit his job to develop an Uber for holiday transfers. FluidCar was a\u00a0smart, affordable way for people to drive themselves from Geneva airport to a ski resort, and then give the car to someone going back the other way. The trial succeeded in winter 2014, but when Rosam sought funding to grow, more than 30 investors said no. He lost \u00a345,000. \u201cIt meant everything to me and it\u2019s really quite painful,\u201d he says. The road is rocky and potentially fatal for any startup, but are there basic flaws in the on-demand model? Stian Westlake, head of research at Nesta, the London-based \u201cinnovation charity\u201d (and Lavanda\u2019s Guy Westlake\u2019s cousin) translates Manjoo\u2019s ending\u00a0dream as \u201cthe trough of disillusionment\u201d, which he sees as a function of the cycle of hype. He explains: \u201cFirst, nobody knows what a\u00a0new tech is, then it gets hyped crazily and everyone thinks it will change the world. Then investors and entrepreneurs pile in. Then people realise that even things that are quite good don\u2019t work, and you see more realistic developments.\u201d The hype is critical, he adds, even if it\u2019s bloody: \u201cWithout it, nobody would take risks or invest in anything.\u201d But he also sees flaws, not least the imperative for these platforms to grow quickly at all costs when margins are low and profits slow to arrive. \u201cWhat if you wanted to do this at a small scale, to set up a version of Uber only in Hull that paid the living wage?\u201d he asks. \u201cHow do you do that in a world where the basic desire is to grow until you serve all 8\u00a0billion people on the planet?\u201d   Related: What\u2019s Yours Is Mine: Against the Sharing Economy by Tom Slee review \u2013 the problem with Airbnb and Uber    Tom Slee, the author of What\u2019s Yours Is Mine: Against the Sharing Economy, has concerns about the consequences of infinite growth. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a fizzling out of the original vision,\u201d he says from his home near Toronto. \u201cThere was this thing years ago about your power drill only being used for 15 minutes in its lifetime. So, let\u2019s all borrow each other\u2019s power drills? But the intermediaries \u2013 the apps \u2013 quickly became anti-communitarian. Because if there is an appeal in them, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t have to deal with other people. \u201cThere seems to be this doublethink in Silicon Valley where they want community-oriented services and globe-straddling behemoths at the same time and don\u2019t seem to see a contradiction in that,\u201d Slee adds. Typically it\u2019s the workers, who are employed effectively as zero-hours, low-paid freelancers, who suffer. Last week, Uber agreed to pay $100m (\u00a370m) to settle a lawsuit in which drivers in two US states had pushed to be recognised as employees. And in the past two months alone, Uber drivers have threatened to down tools over falling fares in Cape Town, Melbourne and New York. The company says the cuts will bring in more business; the drivers say they can\u2019t afford to run their cars. In London, Deliveroo riders report worries about cancelled shifts. \u201cWe are slaves to an app,\u201d one rider told me last month. \u201cDemand management is difficult, but the objective is to provide flexibility,\u201d Destin says in response. \u201cIf some riders are unhappy, the company cares about it, because we live by our riders.\u201d As tensions build, a smaller wave of on-demand entrepreneurs is finding an opportunity inside an opportunity \u2013 to be the \u201canti-Uber for X\u201d. In London, James Middleton, a former City man, has sunk more than \u00a3100,000 of his savings into Street Stream, an on-demand courier app he launched last year. It allows couriers to quote for jobs, and people or small businesses to send stuff across town without a big account. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in couriers being a commodity,\u201d says Middleton, whose \u201cseveral dozen\u201d riders complete 50 jobs on a good day. \u201cOur system allows customers to book an individual they know and like. We find customers are willing to pay more for couriers with good ratings.\u201d Middleton is about to launch a sister app for stranded cyclists called Kerbi \u2013 an Uber for\u00a0punctures. In New York, a man who used to run technology for the Israeli military is going one step further, as he sets out later this spring to launch the anti-Uber for ... Uber. During a video call to his office on the 47th floor of the new World Trade Center building in Manhattan, Talmon Marco shows off a glass meeting room filled with people. \u201cThose are Uber drivers joining Juno,\u201d says the tech entrepreneur, who took on Skype in 2010 with Viber, a\u00a0messaging app (four years later, he sold it to a Japanese company for $900m).     Talmon Marco, who took on Skype with Viber, and is now taking on Uber with his new app Juno. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images    Marco has towering ambition, and will soon lead Juno up to its permanent office on the 84th floor (\u201cI think it will put us and our drivers in a certain state of mind\u201d). He also has a track record and tons of cash, but is he foolish to take on Uber? \u201cI\u2019m going to quote your SAS,\u201d he says. \u201cHe who dares wins.\u201d Moreover, he wants to show that he who wins can be nice about it \u2013 even in a cut-throat market. Juno drivers will become proper employees if they work exclusively for the company, and will keep 90% of fares (it\u2019s 80% or so with Uber). The most loyal drivers will also get equity. \u201cThis will mean we need to spend less on driver acquisition and retention,\u201d Marco says. \u201cQuality of service will also be better, which will attract customers. It\u2019s the right economic and moral decision.\u201d Middleton and Marco may not succeed. Destin expects almost a third of the ventures he funds to fail. He accepts that \u201ca brave new world comes with a bunch of issues\u201d, but adds: \u201cThere\u2019s always blood on the wall when there\u2019s a big new wave of innovation. What we\u2019re seeing is a rationalisation where the winners are emerging. That\u2019s the market maturing, not the end of on-demand.\u201d Rosam and Westlake would love a fraction of Juno\u2019s funds, but both are bullish in the face of failure. Rosam returned to engineering work after FluidCar failed, but is plotting his comeback with a new app (\u201cIt is on-demand, but I wouldn\u2019t want to call it the Uber for anything,\u201d he says). Westlake is already there. When he noticed that some of his laundry customers used the app to maintain Airbnb lets, he decided to \u201cpivot\u201d last September. Lavanda is now an Airbnb management company. He is guarded about numbers, but says revenue growth is between 50 and 100% each month. \u201cWe\u2019re on an upwards trajectory rather than being bogged down doing other people\u2019s laundry,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted.\u201d",
