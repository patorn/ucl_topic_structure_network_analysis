  "body": "Susan Sontag saw herself as a novelist. The years between 1962, when she completed her first novel, The Benefactor, and 1965, when she began her second, Death Kit, were for Sontag \u201ca sharply defined period\u201d in which she wrote many of the literary critical and cultural pieces that came to define her even more strongly than her fiction. In her Paris Review interview of 1994, Sontag confessed: \u201cWriting essays has always been laborious. They go through many drafts, and the end result may bear little relation to the first draft; often I completely change my mind in the course of writing an essay. Fiction comes much easier, in the sense that the first draft contains the essentials \u2013 tone, lexicon, velocity, passions \u2013 of what I eventually end up with.\u201d Sontag\u2019s earliest essays, nonetheless, have a heady and self-confident originality. This collection for instance contains two modern classics, Against Interpretation and Notes on Camp, as well as discussions of L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Godard, a memorable demolition of Ionesco, together with psychoanalysis and science fiction cinema. Sontag, who came to influence generations of readers around the world and saw herself at war with philistinism, was nothing if not transgressive. And always intensely varied. In the same Paris Review interview, she said of her writing that \u201cit\u2019s supposed to be diverse, though of course there is a unity of temperament, of preoccupation \u2013 certain predicaments, certain emotions that recur \u2013 ardour and melancholy. And an obsessive concern with human cruelty, whether cruelty in personal relations or the cruelty of war.\u201d Notes on Camp, which first appeared in 1964 in the Partisan Review, an early patron, fell to one side of that \u201cunity\u201d, but caused a sensation that propelled Sontag to instant prominence in American intellectual circles. Summarising Sontag\u2019s reputation, Time magazine declared that \u201cshe has come to symbolise the writer and thinker in many variations: as analyst, rhapsodist, and roving eye, as public scold and portable conscience\u201d. Sontag would have been gratified by such a description. \u201cI had come to New York at the start of the 1960s,\u201d she wrote later, \u201ceager to put to work the writer I had pledged myself to become.\u201d Her aesthetic was, and would remain, omnivorous. \u201cMy idea of a writer: someone interested in \u2018everything\u2019\u2026 The only surprise was that there weren\u2019t more people like me.\u201d But of course there weren\u2019t. Sontag was inimitable, in both life and work. Her writing quickly became the quintessential commentary to the 1960s, which was unfolding, raucously, and sometimes violently, around her in New York. Typically, she spurned any kind of easy pigeonhole. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the 60s then. For me it was chiefly the time when I wrote my first and second novels, and began to discharge some of the cargo of ideas about art and culture and the proper business of consciousness which had distracted me from writing fiction. I was filled with evangelical zeal.\u201d     Susan Sontag at a writers\u2019 conference in 1966. Photograph: Bob Peterson/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images    In its review of this volume, the New York Times latched on to Sontag\u2019s moralistic side, describing her as a \u201cthoroughly American figure standing at the centre of Against Interpretation. The dress is new, true enough, and the images strange. The haunting image is that of a lady of intelligence and apparent beauty hastening along city streets at the violet hour, nervous, knowing, strained, excruciated (as she says) by self-consciousness, bound for the incomprehensible cinema, or for the concert hall where non-music is non-played, or for the loft where cherry bombs explode in her face and flour sacks are flapped close to her, where her ears are filled with mumbling, senseless sound and she is teased, abused, enveloped, deliberately frustrated until \u2013 until we, her audience, make out suddenly that this scene is, simply, hell, and that the figure in it (but naturally) is old-shoe-American: a pilgrim come again, a flagellant, one more self-lacerating Puritan.\u201d This is super-fine, as far as it goes, but it misses Sontag\u2019s appetite for intellectual exhibitionism. There was, I think, always more than a touch of Oscar Wilde about \u201cMiss Sontag\u201d. Like Wilde, she was a self-confessed \u201cpugnacious aesthete\u201d; like Wilde she revelled in aphorism; and, like Wilde, she absolutely refused to play safe. Despite the promise of her brilliant university career, she had other ideas. \u201cI was not going to settle for being an academic: I would pitch my tent outside the seductive, stony safety of the university world.\u201d Like her contemporary, Germaine Greer (No 13 in this series), Sontag was for \u201cfreedom\u201d, a throwing off of \u201cold hierarchies\u201d, but she was also self-consciously placing herself squarely in a line of American thought: \u201cThe ardours I was advocating seemed to me \u2013 still seem to me \u2013 quite traditional. I saw myself as a newly minted warrior in a very old battle: against philistinism, against ethical and aesthetic shallowness and indifference.\u201d    Like the fumes of heavy industry\u2026 the effusion of interpretations of art today poisons our sensibilities  Susan Sontag     As well as commenting on the 60s, Sontag came to embody the decade. \u201cHow one wishes,\u201d she wrote later, \u201cthat some of its boldness, its optimism, its disdain for commerce had survived. The two poles of distinctively modern sentiment are nostalgia and utopia. Perhaps the most interesting characteristic of the time now labelled \u2018the 60s\u2019 was that there was so little nostalgia. In that sense, it was indeed a utopian moment. The world in which these essays were written no longer exists.\u201d Sontag\u2019s work, however, unequivocally outlives her. The title essay, which even carries an epigraph from Wilde (\u201cIt is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible\u201d) sounds a passionate appeal for \u201can erotics of art\u201d. Sontag\u2019s argument, expressed with much greater brilliance and subtlety than any simplification can convey, is that critical \u201cinterpretation\u201d, which takes its cue from Plato and Aristotle, has become reactionary and stifling. \u201cLike the fumes of the automobile and of heavy industry which befoul the urban atmosphere, the effusion of interpretations of art today poisons our sensibilities.\u201d This, says Sontag, \u201cis the revenge of intellect upon the world.\u201d Thus, the task of the critic is \u201cnot to find the maximum amount of content in a work of art\u2026 Our task is to cut back content so that we can see the thing at all.\u201d Sontag\u2019s Wildean provocations reached their apogee in her famous 1964 essay, Notes on Camp, also collected here. The debt to Wilde is manifest on almost every page. Remarkably, Sontag holds her own with verve. \u201cThe essence of camp,\u201d she begins, \u201cis its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration. And Camp is esoteric \u2013 something of a private code, a badge of identity, even, among small urban cliques.\u201d Cleverly recognising that \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing to be solemn and treatise-like about Camp\u201d and run the risk of having perpetrated \u201ca very inferior piece of Camp\u201d, Sontag proceeds to set out 58 witty and coruscating numbered \u201cnotes\u201d, culminating in the ultimate Camp statement: \u201cIt\u2019s good because it\u2019s awful.\u201d What we need now, more than ever: this kind of originality and risk. A signature sentence \u201cA sensibility (as distinct from an idea) is one of the hardest things to talk about; there are special reasons why Camp, in particular, has never been discussed.\u201d Three to compare Susan Sontag: Illness As Metaphor (1978)Camille Paglia: Vamps & Tramps (1994)Susan Sontag: In America (2000)",
