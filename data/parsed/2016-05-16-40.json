  "body": "Saracens\u2019 chairman Nigel Wray has compared his young core of English players to Manchester United\u2019s class of \u201992 following the club\u2019s maiden European success. If Maro Itoje, Owen Farrell, George Kruis, Jamie George, Will Fraser and the Vunipola brothers stay together, Wray believes there is every chance of further success in the years ahead.   Related: European Champions Cup awards: our writers on the 2015-16 season    Wray has waited two decades to see Saracens become Europe\u2019s leading side and, after Saturday\u2019s 21-9 win over Racing in Lyon. , he is optimistic there is more to come from a predominantly young, English-qualified team. \u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting is that like Manchester United\u2019s class of \u201992, there\u2019s half a dozen of them \u2013 the class of 2008 \u2013 who have all come through together and have now all played in a European final. \u201cPeople forget that we\u2019ve got 17 English players. What\u2019s exciting is that they can go on for the next five years. They\u2019re young lads and, wow, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s a bit grand to use the word \u2018dynasty\u2019 but let\u2019s just say we want to do bloody well. While winning the European Champions Cup was great, there is more. It is a strange word for rugby but they love each other. They really do love each other which means they want to pull out that extra bit for each other. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d Saracens will have a shot at another trophy next week if they can beat Leicester in Saturday\u2019s Premiership semi-final at Allianz Park but, despite having topped the regular season table and won the title last year, Wray is wary of making any assumptions. \u201cTo say there isn\u2019t a chance of their heads being turned might itself be arrogant. We have to work at being humble and keeping their feet on the ground. \u201cOne of my favourite characters is Icarus. When he flew too close to the sun, the gods burned his wings and he came crashing to Earth. I don\u2019t think anybody survives arrogance. But we\u2019re all human beings and our feet do float off the ground and we think we are bloody marvellous. We just have to get them on to the ground as quickly as possible.\u201d Two Saracens players, Itoje and Alex Goode, have been included on the shortlist for the Premiership Player of the Season award, along with George Smith and Charles Piutau of Wasps and the Exeter duo of Gareth Steenson and Don Armand. McCall is also on the shortlist for the director of rugby award alongside Rob Baxter of Exeter, Dai Young of Wasps and Sale\u2019s Steve Diamond. Meanwhile the Wasps second-row forward Bradley Davies is returning to Wales on a national dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union and the Ospreys. The 29-year-old lock, who has won 54 caps, is keen for his young daughter to attend a Welsh-speaking school.",
