  "body": "The NHS choir that beat Justin Bieber to Christmas No 1 is to be the subject of a new film, reports the BBC. The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS choir\u2019s charity single, A Bridge Over You, narrowly beat Bieber\u2019s Love Yourself in December after the singer asked his 72 million Twitter followers to support it.   Related: Justin Bieber beaten by NHS choir to UK Christmas No 1              The film will tell the individual stories of the choir\u2019s 32 members and how they helped get the song to No 1. Rights have been optioned by producer Julia Verdin, best known for Al Pacino\u2019s Shakespeare adaptation The Merchant of Venice. Choir co-ordinator Caroline Smith, who works as a children\u2019s physiotherapist, told the BBC the singers were \u201cthrilled\u201d. \u201cThe world will now get to see our incredible story,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will see the massive power achieved when everyone comes together.\u201d A Bridge Over You finished last year\u2019s Christmas chart race with 127,000 sales and downloads, nearly 31,000 sales more than the multimillion selling popstar. With the two singles neck and neck just hours before close of sales, the Canadian singer tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m hearing this UK Christmas race is close \u2026 but @Choir_NHS single is for charity \u2026 So for 1 week it\u2019s ok not be #1. Let\u2019s do the right thing & help them win. It\u2019s Christmas. @Choir_NHS good luck. This is what it\u2019s all about. Merry Christmas.\u201d The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS choir last month signed to Decca Records, which is owned by Bieber\u2019s label Universal. A debut album, Something Inside So Strong, is due out on 3 June, with proceeds going to the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS trust.",
