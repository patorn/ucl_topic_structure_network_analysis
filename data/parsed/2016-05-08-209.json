  "body": "We\u2019ve all heard the importance of looking within, finding yourself, and being authentic to what you see. What could possibly be wrong with that? Actually, Chinese philosophers 2,000 years ago would say our emphasis on self-discovery has led us dangerously astray and constrains us. Consider the self the way that they did: there is no true self and no self you can discover in the abstract by looking within. Such a self would be little more than a snapshot of you at that particular moment in time. We are messy, multifaceted selves who go through life bumping up against other messy, multifaceted selves. Who we are at any given moment develops through our constantly shifting interactions with other people.    Being untrue to ourselves helps us break bad patterns. Confucius taught that we must \u2018overcome the self\u2019    Philosophers, such as Confucius, advocated living \u201cas if\u201d. They said that by engaging in as-if rituals \u2013 which are the very opposite of the sincere, authentic approach to ourselves \u2013 we will develop into better human beings. How does this work? Consider a game of hide-and-seek with a child. When you play at being a befuddled adult who can\u2019t hide very well, both you and the child know you are just pretending. But by taking on these roles you have both broken from your usual patterns. The triumphant child experiences competence over an adult; the adult is the fallible, vulnerable person bested by a child. We break from who we are when we note the not-so-good patterns we\u2019ve fallen into and then actively work to shift them \u2013 \u201cas if\u201d we were different people in that moment. Such opportunities exist all around us. When we greet someone cheerfully even though we\u2019re feeling down at the moment; when we calmly respond to an infuriating person even though our \u201creal\u201d feeling is anger. In all such instances, we enter an alternate reality in which we draw on different sides of ourselves and each time we do so we come back slightly changed. Being untrue to ourselves helps us break bad patterns. Confucius (who presumably saw the dangers of too much self-absorption and would have almost assuredly been horrified by the Myers-Briggs test) taught that we must \u201covercome the self\u201d. His rituals liberated people from the notion of any sort of essential self. But if there\u2019s no essential self and you are always changing, you might wonder how you could ever decide what\u2019s best for you. Here again, the notion of living life by breaking from who you think you are can help. Consider the example of a student we know: throughout secondary school he\u2019d excelled in maths and science, so when he went to university he expected to continue along that path, and planned on studying economics. He had an interest in Chinese, but quit after a term because learning a foreign language didn\u2019t seem to be a strength of his. After encountering Chinese philosophy, he realised that he didn\u2019t need to limit himself to his strengths and proclivities, nor did he have to stick to a plan he\u2019d previously made, so he returned to Chinese, did a postgraduate degree in Asian studies, and now works as a diplomat. By breaking from his vision of himself he found an expansive and unexpected life. It is liberating to understand the self and the world to be unstable, imperfect and fragmented. This gives us all the more opportunity to shift things on micro levels constantly. We alter things at a small, daily level, and if we\u2019re successful we eventually build tremendous communities around us in which we, and other people, can flourish.
