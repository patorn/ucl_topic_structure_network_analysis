  "body": "With polls suggesting a tight contest, could we be heading towards another minority parliament? The Greens seem happy to fan that analysis, with Adam Bandt, the MP for Melbourne, telling Radio National the party would be open to forming a \u201cstable progressive government\u201d with Labor.   Related: Labor and Liberals accuse each other of collaborating with Greens    But he said Labor seemed to be of the mind that it either governed alone, or not at all, which he said was a \u201ca pig-headed approach\u201d. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, certainly indicated that was still the party\u2019s endgame: \u201cWe are playing to win,\u201d she said, \u201cnot playing to be part of a coalition government. Every seat we lose to the Greens makes it more likely we\u2019ll have Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister.\u201d And later, in Townsville, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, quoted The Castle in his out-of-hand dismissal of the idea \u2013 yep, telling Bandt he was \u201cdreaming\u201d. As Guardian Australia\u2019s Bridie Jabour noted in today\u2019s election blog, even entertaining the idea of potential alliances and preference deals presents the government with the opportunity for a scare campaign. Sure enough, Malcolm Turnbull later asked voters to \u201cconsider what it would be like if we have the same old Labor with the same old deal with the Greens\u201d. This won\u2019t be the last we hear of the possibility of a Labor-Greens government, no matter how keen Labor, at least, are to strike the idea from our minds. The two major parties continued their campaigns along the lines established yesterday, which is broadly to say, businesses (with some robots) versus schools (and Indigenous issues). Country matters Turnbull\u2019s day began at the Mitre 10 hardware store in Forde. Branch owner Ian Gill was in favour of the tax cut the Coalition has to offer, telling Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor Lenore Taylor he\u2019d use it either to employ more people or make more profit. On how this latter point would assist jobs and growth, Turnbull said it was \u201cwell understood ... that if you reduce the level of business taxes ... you will see more investment\u201d.

He said he could \u201csee the spirit\u201d of the government\u2019s national economic plan (\u201cthe confidence, the optimism, the determination to get ahead\u201d \u2013 that national economic plan sure sounds like a winner, doesn\u2019t it?) all around him in Queensland. And once again, Shorten\u2019s day began at a state school, this time in Townsville. It seems the setting is symbolic of what Labor believes the Liberals have forgotten (\u201cThe best way you demonstrate your bona fides is by ... prioritising the proper funding of schools\u201d).     \u2018Bill demonstrates a positive attitude but an unwillingness to participate in group activities.\u2019 Photograph: Mick Tsikas/EPA    Campaigning in north Queensland set him apart, he said, \u201cbecause I will be a prime minister, if elected, who governs for all Australia, not just the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane\u201d. Labor\u2019s education spokeswoman, Kate Ellis, directly invoked the contrast with the Coalition, saying that Turnbull \u201cmay want to talk about youth and jobs but ... you don\u2019t care about youth and jobs if you don\u2019t care about an adequately supported, quality education system\u201d. But Labor was distracted from its desired talking point by questions over its boat policy, prompted by both the Daily Telegraph\u2019s reporting of tensions in the ranks and the appearance of protesters calling on them to \u201clet them stay\u201d at Shorten\u2019s appearance alongside Herbert candidate Cathy O\u2019Toole. The Liberal party took the opportunity to riff on Labor\u2019s \u201c100 positive policies\u201d campaign while simultaneously capitalising on its reputation for being stronger on border protection.    Under Labor more than 800 illegal boats arrived. Whether weak borders or more dysfunction, same old Labor #auspol pic.twitter.com/GCZ7UBwaae\u2014 Liberal Party (@LiberalAus) May 9, 2016    The cross-party social media sniping is well under way \u2013 and making Twitter even more intolerable than usual, with the platform\u2019s in-house analysis of the #ausvotes hashtag so far finding more mentions of @AustralianLabor than @LiberalAus \u2013 make of that what you will.    Super-troopers  The conservative thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs is gearing up to run an aggressive public campaign against the Turnbull government\u2019s superannuation changes. Its members are furious at the super reforms revealed in Scott Morrison\u2019s budget, and met this morning to discuss how to formally oppose them. Central to the issue is whether capping lifetime contributions to super and limiting the amount of super balances which can earn tax-free income are retrospective changes. The government has insisted that\u2019s not the case, with trade minister Steve Ciobo telling ABC News Radio this morning there was nothing retrospective about increasing a tax from zero to 15%. But IPA executive director John Roskam told Guardian Australia the government\u2019s proposed super changes had become an \u201cabsolute firestorm\u201d among Coalition supporters and IPA members, and the government\u2019s claim that the changes were not retrospective had made people \u201ceven more angry\u201d.

And also ...     Peter Dutton. Photograph: Sam Mooy/AAP    Immigration minister Peter Dutton announced this afternoon that he would not be appealing against a federal court finding that he breached his duty of care to the asylum seeker known as S99, who became pregnant after being raped on Nauru. Dutton will now have to fly S99 to a country where she can safely undergo an abortion. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ...     A stock image of a pug, political views unknown.

We can go to the pictures.\u201d Rich people don\u2019t even notice their tax-free threshold lift. Why don\u2019t I get it? Why do they get it?\u2019    Self-described Aussie battler Duncan Storrar is being hailed as a hero of the common people after apparently sticking it to assistant treasurer Kelly O\u2019Dwyer on Monday night\u2019s Q&A. (Though her passing reference to a \u201c$6,000 toaster\u201d did some of the work for him.) Storrar\u2019s question about the negligible impact of lifting the tax-free threshold for high-income earners was doing the rounds on social media all day, with #IStandWithDuncan trending on Twitter. Fairfax even profiled the 45-year-old father of two, the \u201chuman face on the budget battle\u201d.
