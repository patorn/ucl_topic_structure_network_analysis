In this episode, a group infiltrates and attacks our floating headquarters, and a \u201cstrong\u201d leader who\u2019s not afraid of violence teaches a few of the supposed good guys a couple of lessons about morality in the new world. This was the Governor storyline of season three, and the Negan storyline of the parent season\u2019s most recent run. Don\u2019t we want the spin-off to be different?    Related: Fear the Walking Dead recap: season two, episode three \u2013 Ouroboros    No one\u2019s asking to remove the zombie guts from the engine, but Fear\u2019s biggest problem was always going to be how it stood out. So far, its focus on family hasn\u2019t been enough. We can blame Alicia for the attack on the Abigail, what with her overly trusting conversation with Jack on the radio back in the season premiere. The attackers use a ruse about a pregnant woman in need, and it\u2019s not long before Jack, Reed and Vita have taken everyone hostage and Strand adrift on a raft. Talk immediately turns to the mysterious leader, Connor \u2026 justas minions of the original series would talk about the Governor or Negan before viewers got a glimpse. Alicia, vying for the title of The Worst this week, seems more concerned that she was lied to about Jack\u2019s dead girlfriend than anything else. Predictably, she convinces Jack to ensure her family\u2019s safety in exchange for her going with them. Meanwhile, Travis convinces Reed that he can start the boat, and by smuggling a knife from the machine room furthers his plot to free the hostages. When Connor arrives with reinforcements, he says he\u2019ll take Alicia and Travis only \u2013 kind of a surprise, since everyone talked about the need for people who can handle themselves, and Alicia and Travis do not pass that bar. Even Chris has proven himself handier in a pinch. It\u2019s like a pro football team using their first two picks in the draft on a garden gnome and a golden retriever. \u2018The rest of the world has fallen away\u2019  When this episode didn\u2019t feel like The Walking Dead, it felt like Lost, full of flashbacks about Strand\u2019s story. That the character turns out to be gay was a pleasant surprise, if quickly obvious, thanks to the body language in a bar. There are a few gay people in the franchise, but as a fellow friend of Dorothy, I\u2019m glad such a complicated and central figure is in love with a man. And the Abigail turns out not to be named for a woman, but rather Thomas Abigail, a millionaire and Strand\u2019s significant other, whom he met in a hotel bar after losing his fortune in Hurricane Katrina. Strand stole from Abigail, but used that to create a new fortune, and is now on a quest to reunite with him at their immaculate, splendid hideaway in Mexico \u2013 at least until the zombies get them. But all this character development also revealed that Strand wasn\u2019t about to die, not yet, and not in a deflated raft. It also gave the show a needed boost: Strand became a more compelling character, and one to root for outside the central family. \u2018Death is a way to new life\u2019  While the episode\u2019s major plots were the hijacking and Strand\u2019s past, it began with Nick washing ashore naked and his wander through an eerie tent village. He again tricks the undead by masking his scent with zombie guts, but did he have to use so much? Wouldn\u2019t just a dollop on his clothes suffice? He had gone to meet Luis, Strand\u2019s de facto brother-in-law waiting for a pickup at a development in southern California. He\u2019s the contact to get everyone across the border, though the coyote plan also raises a question: why not just sail around it? At ant rate, he meets Luis\u2019 mother Celia, who claims her sons are a force to be reckoned with and that she and Thomas are waiting for Strand. That the extended Manawa-Salazar clan is along for the ride is a surprise to all parties, but the episode\u2019s subsequent plot points should not surprise viewers. Madison shanks Reed with the weapon Travis left behind, Chris is increasingly aggressive \u2013 though apparently a bit smarter than before \u2013 and the hijackers are routed. Too bad they didn\u2019t get there before Connor ran off with Travis and Alicia somewhere \u2013 one can only hope it\u2019s a Waterworld flotilla, Kevin Costner and all. And though the episode was formulaic, it at least set up a new path for Alicia and Travis, and turned Mexico into a more interesting land than just the vague destination for our floating family.",
