  "body": "Dave was fed up. Being prime minister wasn\u2019t as much fun as he had hoped. Half his party now hated him for supporting the EU, Boris was gunning for his job, he\u2019d been made to do a photo op with the comatose Zac \u2013 Jesus, was the guy alive or not? \u2013 and now he\u2019d been forced into a humiliating climbdown over child refugees. Why couldn\u2019t they have found somewhere to go on their own? Whatever happened to a sense of adventure? To round off a thoroughly bad 24 hours, he now had to waste half an hour on another prime minister\u2019s questions. Sod it. He wouldn\u2019t bother.   Related: Elections 2016: what you'll be voting for on 5 May    \u201cCould the prime minister explain his cuts in social care?\u201d asked Jeremy Corbyn. Dave\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do things differently this week. I\u2019m going to pretend to be the leader of the opposition and I\u2019m going to ask you the questions. So, you tell me why Labour is riddled with antisemites and why Hamas and Hezbollah came to your birthday party.\u201d Corbyn wasn\u2019t entirely happy at this turn of events. He hadn\u2019t banked on being prime minister just yet. If ever. But to give no answer at all would be tricky. \u201cI can assure you no racists ever came to my birthday party,\u201d he insisted. \u201cCan we now go back to the government\u2019s social care policy?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Dave. \u201cIt is a complete outrage. It always used to be the Tories who were the natural home of racists and now Labour has stolen our policy. I demand some answers.\u201d It would probably have been better if, at this point, Corbyn had tried to explain how, though Hamas had been at his birthday party, they weren\u2019t BFFs and he had only invited them in the hope they might behave a bit better. Instead he chose to attack the prime minister for the Conservative party\u2019s smear campaign against his friend, Sadiq Khan, in London mayoral contest. \u201cYou complete idiot,\u201d shouted Sadiq, from somewhere in greater London \u201cYou\u2019ve just cost me another 10,000 votes. We\u2019re not friends and we never will be.\u201d Dave saw absolutely nothing wrong in trying to make out that since Sadiq was a Muslim he was therefore almost certainly a terrorist. \u201cSadiq has been spotted talking to some extremely unpleasant people,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them may even have been members of the Conservative party. This proves that if he is elected as London mayor there will definitely be a terrorist atrocity somewhere in the world at some point in the next two years. So vote for the dopey bloke instead.\u201d With LOQs (Leader of Opposition questions) having descended into a toxic mix of competitive racism and electioneering, Dave cheered up a bit. He hadn\u2019t had to answer a single question about his government\u2019s social care policy. Which was just as well, because he hadn\u2019t a clue if it had one. Just as he was about to congratulate himself on slipping off the hook, Dave remembered he had an appearance before the liaison committee later than afternoon to explain the government\u2019s support for remaining in the EU. Damn it. There wasn\u2019t much chance of him getting away with not answering the questions of every select committee chair. Still he\u2019d give it a go. \u201cGood afternoon prime minister,\u201d said Andrew Tyrie, the committee\u2019s capo di tutti capi. \u201cWould you be recommending a remain vote in the referendum if you hadn\u2019t managed to renegotiate anything?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a hypothetical question,\u201d said Dave, evenly. \u201cNo it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a straightforward yes or no.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a conditional question because it\u2019s got an if in it.\u201d One down ten to go. Dave looked warily at the rest of the committee. At least half of them were angry Brexiteers who were bound to make trouble. Bill Cash wouldn\u2019t be a problem because nobody took any notice of him any more. But Bernard Jenkin would be tricky. Conspiracy theorists always are. \u201cI want you to take down every government website during the referendum campaign,\u201d insisted Bernie. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Dave. \u201cBecause they will secretly talk to people to make them vote to remain.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re overreacting a bit.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve got a legal precedent about a golf club notice from 1937.\u201d A look of concern passed over the face of every committee member. They hadn\u2019t realised just how unwell Bernie had become. But Bernie wasn\u2019t to be stopped. \u201cIf you don\u2019t obey me you can expect a letter before action.\u201d \u201cCalm down, Bernie.\u201d \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll get a writ.\u201d Dave was back where he had started the day, falling out with his own party. Now he came to think of it, he rather missed LOQs.",
