Not sure, sorry    \u201cTo Dimitri and Mustafa and all the other people with unpronounceable names like Waleed, I want to say one thing: that is that I am incredibly humbled you would even think to invest in me that way.  \u201cBut I\u2019m also incredibly saddened by it, because the truth is you deserve more numerous and more worthy avatars than that. \u201cI don\u2019t know if and when that\u2019s going to happen but if tonight means anything \u2026 that is the Australian public, our audience, as far as they\u2019re concerned there is absolutely no reason that can\u2019t change.\u201d The former academic turned radio broadcaster and popular writer paid tribute to the other nominees in the Gold Logie category: his Project co-host Carrie Bickmore who won last year, SBS News veteran Lee Lin Chin, ABC actor Essie Davis, game show host Grant Denyer and The Block host Scott Cam. \u201cEach nominee brilliantly distills some separate piece of Australia and I think it\u2019s an amazing thing that that can be assembled on this night in this way,\u201d Aly said. \u201cIf you step back and look at those pieces assembled, it is a truly spectacular mosaic.\u201d Aly\u2019s nomination prompted News Corp publications to run a bizarre column titled \u201cSix reasons why Waleed Aly should not win Gold\u201d, which appeared only to cement his popularity.  Aly, who also won the Silver Logie for best presenter, told hosts TV Week that being recognised by a popular vote was \u201cvery humbling\u201d.

Because when you walk into a job like this, there is so much scope for doing badly and there is so much scope for being rejected by an audience that has grown attached to what the show was before you got there.\u201d In another game changing moment for the Logies, Noni Hazlehurst became only the second woman in the award\u2019s 56-year history to be inducted into the TV Week Gold Logie Hall of Fame.  Hazlehurst, 62, gave a stirring, emotional speech about children\u2019s television, mental health and the power of the medium to do good.  \u201cI fear that our hearts are growing cold,\u201d the star of The Sullivans, Play School, and A Place to Call Home said. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m only the second woman to be given this honour is merely a reflection of the prevailing guard ... [But] things are changing.  \u201cThey are changing glacially slowly. The great thing about glaciers is that if you\u2019re not on them, you go under. I have been riding that glacier for 40 years and I am staying on top of it.\u201d  The ABC\u2019s Sarah Ferguson picked up most outstanding public affairs report for The Killing Season, while Seven won the news category for its coverage of the Parramatta shooting.",
