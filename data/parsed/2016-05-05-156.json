  "body": "\u201cHumour is a tool of provocation and survival in the music of Schnittke,\u201d writes violinist Miranda Cuckson in her sleeve notes. \u201cA cheeky attitude anchored by deep purpose.\u201d Which isn\u2019t a bad summation of the commonalities between B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Alfred Schnittke and Witold Lutos\u0142awski \u2013 all composers who loved the jostle between wit and weight, spirit and logic, raw emotion and modernism. Cuckson and pianist Blair McMillen end up delivering less cheeky attitude and more of the deep purpose: their playing is frank and urgent, with powerfully stripped-back quiet passages in Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Second Sonata, a gritted-teeth ecstatic climax at the heart of Lutos\u0142awski\u2019s Partita, and brutal attacks and silences in Schnittke\u2019s extraordinary Second Sonata. Cuckson calls those silences \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d, but she plays them absolutely stony-faced.",
