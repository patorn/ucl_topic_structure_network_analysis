  "body": "Sources of inspiration ranged from algorithms to ancient oaks for designers taking coveted gold medals at the Chelsea flower show. But it was Andy Sturgeon\u2019s dramatic depiction of a landscape moulded over millions of years by myriad geological events that clinched best show garden for the Telegraph at the world\u2019s most prestigious horticultural show. Sturgeon\u2019s Captured Landscape had faced stiff competition. The M&G garden drew on designer Cleve West\u2019s teenage years spent in the ancient oak woodland of Exmoor to claim gold. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best garden I\u2019ve done here. So very happy,\u201d he said on receiving his medal. Jo Thompson\u2019s Chelsea barracks garden, inspired by the development of the former barracks site next door to the show\u2019s royal hospital venue, also took a gold. It had been \u201ca painful process, but it has been worth it,\u201d she said.   Related: The best of the Chelsea flower show    James Basson\u2019s L\u2019Occitane garden, a recreation of the edge of a lavender field, transporting visitors through colour and scent to the heart of Haute Provence, equally wowed the judges. Sturgeon, however, had the edge. His bold design and attention to detail won the highest praise for a garden incorporating 17 huge bronze fins representing a mountain range, cool stream water, and semi-arid plantings echoing the chaparral of California\u2019s Sierra Madres and the Chilean Matorral. His aim, he said, was to take visitors to an imagined landscape inspired by \u201cthings I have seen from my travels around the world and brought altogether into this place that existed only in my mind, until now\u201d. It was a garden took 10 months to design, comprising 80 tonnes of stone, plants from France, Italy and Spain. It sought to highlight the need to adapt gardens to their environment and to changing climate. Sturgeon, who has now won two best show garden awards, was \u201ctotally over the moon\u201d.  He had started as 2/1 favourite with bookmaker William Hill, but betting was suspended before the announcement because 100% of the wagers were placed on his garden winning.

We have clearly underestimated the Andy Sturgeon-designed garden which our green-fingered clients think is a certainty,\u201d said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams, with the announcement still pending.  The Morgan Stanley garden for Great Ormond Street hospital, to which it will be relocated, also claimed one of the six show garden gold medals. The plant-rich design by Chris Bearshaw of woodland diversity, which features dappled shade, restful water and a rich green scheme sprinkled with pockets of colourful plantings, is designed to provide a reflective space for the families of children undergoing treatment. Equally restful was Paul Martin\u2019s gold medal-winning Vestra Wealth garden of mindful living, which drew its inspiration from yoga and travel in the far east, to provide a calm space for a busy city worker.     The Harrods British Eccentrics garden. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Diarmuid Gavin\u2019s whacky Harrods British Eccentrics garden, with its revolving topiary trees, bobbing box hedge balls and levitating flower boxes proved, as some predicted, to be a little too out there for the judges, but did earn silver gilt. Nick Bailey\u2019s Winton Beauty of Mathematics, which translated mathematics and algorithms into a horticultural delight, was also among the eight silver gilt winners. The best fresh garden award was claimed by the Marble and Granite centre with Antithesis of Sarcophagi, a stark and highly unusual garden within a giant 44-tonne granite cube, created by Martin Cook and Gary Breeze.  The fresh garden category aims to redefine the perception of the garden, taking a more conceptual approach, and embracing technology, trends and materials to create a truly innovative design. The Modern Slavery garden, in which doors open a path to freedom from within iron railings in Juliet Sargeant\u2019s celebration of parliament passing the Modern Slavery Act in 2015, was awarded a gold medal. Best artisan garden was given to Viking Cruises Mekong garden with Sarah Eberle\u2019s water garden drawing inspiration from the floating gardens of Cambodia and the Mekong river. Senri-Sentei-Garage Garden, a garden for car enthusiasts who want to transform the car porch, and The Garden Bed \u2013 a partnership with Asda \u2013 which placed a hospital bed at the centre of a hospice garden, were both awarded artisan garden gold medals.",
