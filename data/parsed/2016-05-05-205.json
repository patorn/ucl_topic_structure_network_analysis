  "body": "Aline Ferreira\u2019s son wears a blue and white babygrow. Over her shoulder, she carries a cloth to wipe his mouth. She smiles happily, but anyone can see there is something severely wrong with three month-old Luiz. His head seems squashed out of shape, and it flops forward. Luiz has microcephaly \u2013 a head that has not grown to its full size \u2013 and the pattern of brain damage that doctors now link to the Zika virus. His mother \u2013 at 15, hardly more than a child herself \u2013 developed a rash two months into her pregnancy but assumed it was dengue fever, which has become as common as a cold in Brazil in recent years. Now she spends much of her time at two major hospitals in Recife: one for disabled children, and the Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira (Imip), where she is today.   Related: A global defence system to fight virus threats is urgently needed    \u201cI got up at 1.30am to come here,\u201d says Aline.  It is a three-hour bus journey to the hospital from Vertentes, on the outskirts of Recife in the northern state of Pernambuco, where she lives, but she comes in three or four times a week for the rehabilitation programme in which Luiz was enrolled two months ago. He gets physiotherapy to help him hold his head up and to flex his feet. \u201cI think he is improving,\u201d she says. Aline speaks with great composure and equanimity for somebody so young, in such a situation. She had no idea that there was a problem until she had an ultrasound at eight months. The radiographer was afraid to tell her what she had seen. When she saw the doctor who referred her to Imip, he assumed she already knew. \u201cHe said, \u2018Your baby has microcephaly\u2019, and I was shocked and it was not easy to cope,\u201d she says. That time was the worst. \u201cAt the beginning, people were terrible,\u201d says Aline. \u201cPeople said I would have to stay permanently in hospital and he would have problems feeding and be sick. But now he looks fine to me. He can feed and he interacts with me and smiles and I am relieved.\u201d She loves her baby. Back in the waiting room, her 23-year-old boyfriend puts his arm around Aline and his child. Her family have all accepted Luiz, she says. Babies with microcephaly attracted unwanted attention in the early months of the crisis. \u201cIn the waiting room, other mothers wanted to do a selfie with them,\u201d says Dr M\u00f4nica Coentro, clinical director of Imip. \u201cThere is stigma. We had a similar problem with HIV when we diagnosed the first infections in 1987. Lower-income families accepted it, but the higher-income families did not. If a lower-income mother died, an aunt or even a neighbour would take the child. The higher-income families were more likely to think of adoption.\u201d The great majority of the microcephaly babies have been born to poorer families. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it is linked to low-income families or there are more vectors [mosquitoes carrying the virus] in the area where they live,\u201d says Edvaldo Souza, an immunologist in infectious diseases. \u201cWe are trying to find out if micronutrient deficiency, agricultural pesticides or herbicides have anything to do with it. We don\u2019t know.\u201d Luiz is loved but will need care for the rest of his life \u2013 from what they have seen on the brain scans of affected babies, that is one of the few things doctors are certain about.  \u201cThose children will need rehabilitation forever,\u201d says gynaecologist Adriana Scavuzzi. \u201cWe don\u2019t know much about these diseases, but if we compare with other microcephalies, we see the kids will need extra care for years to come.  \u201cIt has a major impact on a woman\u2019s life and family life. Some of those women have to stop working to take care of these children. It means less money for their family. There is an economic impact.\u201d Aline has already left school because of the baby. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they will have the rehabilitation to achieve their potential,\u201d says Scavuzzi. \u201cWe know they will be deeply affected by this disease. Their neurological and cognitive functions will be severely affected. But we don\u2019t know if the health system will be able to provide them with all the care they need. It is a big concern of all the doctors.\u201d In outpatients, Dr Danielle Cruz, a paediatrician, is examining a seven-month-old boy. He is well-grown but he lies in her arms slowly moving his legs, as if thoughtfully. This is the mother\u2019s first visit. There could be many more babies affected who have not yet come to the attention of doctors. Cruz thinks this boy probably does have microcephaly but they will need to do tests on his nervous system. They are seeing two types of problems with these babies, says Souza. Some have spasticity and trouble swallowing; others are hypotonic, moving less than an unaffected baby. Among the 239 microcephaly cases they have seen so far at Imip, 90 have confirmed exposure to Zika and most of the others are still being tested. The CT scans show calcifications unlike other types of microcephaly. \u201cThe locale of the calcification is different and the disproportion of the face, and they look different. In other cases of microcephaly, newborns are small for gestational age,\u201d she says. The babies they have seen have high Apgar scores at birth, showing good blood circulation, pulse, breathing, reflexes, and arm and leg movement. The Imip saw its first case in August, and then there were many. In August to September, they detected 29 cases. In alarm, they contacted the Pernambuco health department.  Doctors have been hard pressed to deal with the crisis, says Adriana Seavuzzi. These were not high-risk pregnancies. Women with an ultrasound showing microcephaly could deliver in their local hospital. \u201cBut when this outbreak happened, women and other people got panicked and they started to come here,\u201d she says. \u201cThe problem came during a crisis. We have been living in a health crisis for years. The situation was already very bad. We don\u2019t have enough beds for all the women who come to us. Some of them we have to send to other hospitals because we can\u2019t receive all the women.\u201d Imip\u2019s clinical director Coentro says there are three very stressful times for the mothers. The first is when they develop a rash, which is a Zika symptom. The second is the ultrasound scan, which some refuse, and the third is the birth itself. But when they are told they have a baby with microcephaly and possible brain damage, \u201csome women deny the problem\u201d, she says. \u201cThey say, \u2018My baby is normal\u2019.\u201d   Related: On the front line in Brazil\u2019s war on Zika: \u2018I felt I was in a horror movie\u2019    They do come back for the checkups and the rehabilitation, which includes physiotherapy and psychological and social support, but they are determinedly positive. \u201cThey take nice photos every month and post them on Facebook \u2013 but they do also understand that their baby has special needs. They accept it.\u201d Luiz has the support of his entire family, but it is not always so. \u201cSome husbands leave the home,\u201d says Coentro. She says it is hard for the hospitals to give the women and their babies all the help and support they need. \u201cIt is a great problem. We have here few local therapists to stimulate the potential of these children,\u201d she says. Although they begin breastfeeding well, at around one month some babies have developed difficulties swallowing, for which they need physiotherapy help. As they get bigger \u2013 the oldest are only seven months \u2013 their needs will be greater. Damage to the eyes and hearing are common. The numbers of babies born with signs of microcephaly dropped in March, she says. \u201cWe feel there is a slowing down in the increase in these cases. We don\u2019t know if it was the recommendation to women of fertility age to postpone pregnancy. We don\u2019t know if it is this or a decrease in the rates of the mosquito vector or infections.\u201d Scavuzzi fears this may become an endemic problem, affecting babies for years to come. She strongly feels that the health of impoverished women living in Brazil\u2019s mosquito-ridden favelas needs to be a much higher national priority. \u201cWe hope that it was an outbreak and we don\u2019t have any more cases but the sanitation conditions are the same. There was no big [improvement] in the conditions last year. So are we going to get rid of this? Everything is starting again. It is raining again and maybe we will have more problems,\u201d she says. \u201cOur minister of health said recently that he hoped that as many women as possible get the infection. But I think it is likely to lose the battle if you think the only way to get rid of a disease is by getting the infection spread to everybody. The goal should be to improve the people\u2019s lives. \u201cThe government must take the bull by the horns. They are the ones who should invest in improvement of people\u2019s lives when it comes to sanitation and health. It is not the health Brazilian people deserve.\u201d",
