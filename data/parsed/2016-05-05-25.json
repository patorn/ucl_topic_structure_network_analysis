  "body": "Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, has called for the resignation of the chair of a parliamentary committee investigating the retailer\u2019s demise suggesting he was \u201cprejudiced\u201d against the entrepreneur.   Related: What is the Pension Protection Fund and will BHS sink it?    The retail chain, which Green sold for \u00a31 to a little-known group of investors a year ago, collapsed into administration last week putting 11,000 jobs at risk and the pensioners in the hands of the government\u2019s pension protection fund (PFF). The matter is the subject of two parliamentary inquiries, which will hold a special joint session to take evidence from Green next month. But on Thursday, Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee that is set to begin its inquiry into BHS on Monday, told the Financial Times that he would recommend stripping Green of his knighthood if the retail tycoon did not put up funds to pay off the \u00a3571m pension fund deficit. Field said: \u201cI hope that I reflect the anger of BHS pensioners who feel that money is not there in the pension scheme.\u201d He said Green needed to make good the pension deficit at BHS so that it would not need to be rescued by the pension protection fund. \u201cI feel that Philip Green has a moral duty to make good the pension scheme and if he doesn\u2019t, while I can\u2019t speak for the committee as a whole, I personally would recommend he should lose his knighthood.\u201d Field said he had not pre-judged the inquiry. \u201cSir Philip is a master of bullying but he will find that parliament isn\u2019t for being bullied.\u201d  Green hit back in a statement saying he was horrified by Field\u2019s \u201coutrageous outburst\u201d. \u201cClearly he has made his decision as to what he feels the punishment should be without even hearing any evidence from anybody about BHS or the circumstances of the last 15 years,\u201d Green said.     Frank Field has called for Green to have his knighthood stripped. Photograph: Frank Baron for the Guardian    Green said the comments suggested there would not be a balanced hearing when Field and fellow MPs begin their inquiry on Monday with evidence from the PFF, the pension \u201clifeboat\u201d funded by a levy on businesses. \u201cI think Mr Field needs to stand down from the inquiry immediately as he is clearly prejudiced,\u201d he said. Green said that BHS\u2019s board had not been involved in any decisions made by the trustees of the BHS pension fund other than in complying with their decisions. He added that the \u00a3571m deficit figure was based on the cost of a buyout of the fund by an insurance company \u2013 a much higher figure than the deficit if the fund is taken on by the PPF. Green has reportedly offered to put up \u00a380m \u2013 including \u00a340m in cash and \u00a340m in writing off a loan to BHS \u2013 in discussions with the pension regulator. The regulator has the power to pursue former company owners if they are seen to have left the pension in difficulties. Under Green\u2019s stewardship, more than \u00a3586m was extracted in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans by the Green family and other shareholders, including The Ivy restaurant owner, Richard Caring.  Green has agreed to appear before an unusual joint session of the business, innovation and skills select committee and the work and pensions select committee. He is expected to go to parliament in mid-June after the committees have taken evidence from other parties, including Dominic Chappell, the boss of Retail Acquisitions \u2013 which bought BHS a year ago, and the BHS pension trustees.Retail Acquisitions extracted more than \u00a325m of payments, including professional fees and loan interest, from BHS in the year before it entered administration with debts of \u00a31.3bn. The Guardian has revealed that Chappell could be forced to return millions paid to his consortium during its controversial 13-month ownership of BHS. The legal director of BHS has written to Chappell asking him for \u00a350,000 that was not repaid after he moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer to an obscure corporate vehicle in the days before its collapse. Meanwhile, administrators are examining whether loans paid to Retail Acquisitions can be called in.",
