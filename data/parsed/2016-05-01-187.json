  "body": "I had just finished this remarkable book and this review, when I heard of Jenny Diski\u2019s death on Thursday morning. Diski was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer in August 2014. The news prompted her to respond in the only way that had ever seemed meaningful to her, to write about it \u2013 and, once and for all, to tell the full, strange story of her writer\u2019s life, one that was linked fatefully to her having been taken in as a 15-year-old \u201cwaif\u201d by Doris Lessing. I had the privilege of talking to Diski about some of this not long after she started out on her journey into that past. She confessed, among other things, the born writer\u2019s guiltiest secret: that even the worst possible news lights a spark. In hearing her diagnosis, among her first thoughts had been that cancer might be \u201ca way of writing about Doris\u201d, an idea she had been stumped by since Lessing herself had died a year earlier. \u201cI was terribly excited to think I had a subject, or a project,\u201d she said, wrapped in a cashmere blanket in her front room in Cambridge, with due irony. She will, no doubt, have had a writer\u2019s sense of pride to have met her last deadline and seen her project\u00a0published. The writing of In Gratitude has punctuated the long narrative of Diski\u2019s progressing illness, which was slowed but not defeated by sessions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Addenbroke\u2019s hospital. No detail of that gradual, brutal decline is overlooked in this story \u2013 Diski has a bone-dry matter-of-fact line in documenting the betrayals of her body, the humiliating falls, and \u201cmesh of steroid effects\u201d, her \u201cclot-headed\u201d hospice dreams. The middle section of the book is a clear-eyed meditation on modern mortality: \u201cI can\u2019t get into the car without waving an electric hand-held fan in my face and swigging on liquid morphine.\u201d Respite from that hard-to-endure present came in her no less forensic and determined untangling of the past. She was half-adopted, or fostered, or taken in by Lessing \u2013 she never really could explain their relationship \u2013 after she had escaped her estranged parents\u2019 dysfunctional and abusive attentions, first to a social-services sponsored place at a boarding school (from which she was expelled after falling for a local journalist) and then a period in a psychiatric hospital. While there, Lessing sent her a note out of the blue inviting her to come and live with her and her son Peter (who had known Diski a little, at least by reputation, as the \u201cwickedest girl\u201d at school). Diski was all set to take up a bed in a hostel in London, having found work in a shoe shop. In part, the \u201cgratitude\u201d of this book\u2019s title refers to that initial gesture from Lessing, if not always to what followed.   Related: Jenny Diski on Doris Lessing: \u2018I was the cuckoo in the nest\u2019    She turned up like a fully fledged foundling: \u201cI knocked on the door, wearing an awful mustard-yellow woollen coat with a brown velvet collar and kind of pleated below and dropped waistline, which my mother thought was very grown up and respectable, and which I would never wear again.\u201d Lessing greeted her with a small kitten in her arms, \u201cLook, she can be your cat\u201d \u2013 an act of kindness unusual for its awkward simplicity in Diski\u2019s memory. The relationship between Lessing and Diski subsequently proved a kind of lifelong case study of complication and withholding, which this book nags at like a knot. For all the vaunted confessional honesty and socialist (and feminist) principle of her books the Nobel prize winner emerges as pathologically self-serving and self-absorbed, treating Diski (and almost everyone else who came to \u201csit at Doris\u2019s feet and gather wisdom\u201d) first as a kind of abstract project for improvement, then as a nuisance and a disgrace, and finally as literary\u00a0material.    Diski wondered towards the end whether art was always a product of pain; she was defiantly unconvinced    When Diski arrived, Lessing had, she suggests, moved on from ideas of liberation through communism and sex, and was now in search of a \u201cmetaphysical education\u201d. Part of this was a determination to accept every obligation chance put in her way, not with love necessarily but with stoic fortitude. The foundling was part of this experiment. When Diski herself started to write, Lessing made her swear never to explore their relationship in print, but that didn\u2019t stop Lessing creating hardly fictionalised characters that detailed Diski\u2019s intimacies, and letting her know about it. In some ways, then, this book is a settling of scores, a setting of the record straight. Diski was too honest and spirited a writer to make that impulse ever seem like an act of spite. As this memoir compulsively retreats from the grimmest day-to-day reality of her illness (\u201cit\u2019s like a punishment. But for\u00a0what?\u201d), she finds plenty of occasion for understanding Lessing, and even to see in herself the time-protecting writer\u2019s coldness \u2013 \u201cI was at\u00a0least as selfish as Doris\u201d \u2013 though you\u00a0are not quite convinced. Lessing never apparently read a word of Diski\u2019s\u00a0books \u2013 her 10 wonderful shape-shifting novels, or her seven dazzling works of nonfiction. The loss was hers. The cliche goes that at the moment of death all our life passes in front of us. Rarely can a book so effectively have dramatised that idea. Diski wondered towards the end whether art\u00a0was always a product of pain; she was defiantly unconvinced. Though she shared much of Lessing\u2019s blunt distrust \u00a0of sentiment, throughout this book she can\u2019t help finding at least as much comfort in her own roles of mother and of grandmother and of wife (to \u201cThe Poet\u201d Ian Patterson) as much as \u201cwriter\u201d. Despite her unvarnished fear of \u201cdissolution, of casting my particles to the wind\u201d, and at the \u201cinsoluble grief\u201d of not seeing her grandchildren grow up, there is, still, a triumphant note to her fast unspooling history. As the scenes of her traumatic and chaotic childhood pass by she reminds us, sentence by sentence, not only that she emerged to become every bit the writer she always dreamed of being, but also that, despite everything, along the way she learned a great deal about love.
