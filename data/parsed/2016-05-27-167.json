  "body": "The track I\u2019ll be opening my next DJ set with Death Grips: Guillotine            I usually open with this as it\u2019s such an aggressive sound. It grabs your attention, and it\u2019s so off-key-sounding that people don\u2019t know what to expect afterwards. The track that got me out of bed this morning Steve Spacek: Melin Dreams Something I was working on late last night on GarageBand on my phone. It\u2019s a hypnotic track for the dancefloor. The track I\u2019d play to show off my eclectic tastes Moondog: Viking 1             This is an amazing piece played on a vibraphone. It\u2019s a great way to send the crowd off. The track that should have been a crossover hit Fatima: La Neta             This came out about two years ago from my peeps over at Eglo. It\u2019s by Swedish-UK soul singer Fatima; produced by Flako, and is the perfect mix of soul and modern day electronics. The track I\u2019d play at my auntie\u2019s wedding Tiger: When (Steve Spacek remix)            A wicked dancehall tune with a truly infectious beat, along with some comical lyrics that all rhyme with \u201cwhen\u201d. I reckon auntie would be skanking to this one! The best track by my favourite new artist Packer & Rhodes ft Natalie Slade: Where We Go Natalie is a Sydney-based singer-songwriter who I\u2019m working with, and this is a collab between her and myself. Look out for it some time this year, maybe on my new label SPA. The ideal festival track Mark Pritchard: Soundboy Fuck Off        I love this track! Whenever I hear it, it gives me this vibe. The closest thing I can relate it to is a feeling people might get when they want to mosh, if that makes any sense. The track I\u2019d play at sunset in Ibiza Bobby Konders: The Poem            Anyone who remembers raving back in the day would and should remember this one\u2026 I\u2019m not even gonna describe it! It\u2019s best to have a listen, it speaks for itself. Steve Spacek plays Corsica Studios, SE17, Sunday 29 May; Soup Kitchen, Manchester, Thursday 2 June",
