An executive is practising tai chi by the cactus garden, while another jiggles in a robotic massage chair nearby. A volleyball match is in full swing in the lush-planted courtyard below, while raucous shrieks of table football emerge from the Chill Zone, next to a row of space-age nap pods. \u201cMeet by the ping-pong tables,\u201d reads a sign stuck on the window. \u201cToday\u2019s spinning class will be on the terrace! :)\u201d With its new $300m office block, which stands like a stack of gleaming white hard drives at an intersection north of San Jose, the South Korean electronics giant is plunging headlong into the holiday camp workplace culture of the Bay Area tech scene. \u201cWe wanted to introduce more of a startup vibe to the company,\u201d says Jim Elliott, Samsung\u2019s vice-president of memory marketing, a job title as otherworldly as the building he works in. \u201cWe were all separated in our different departmental islands before, but this building is about bringing people together and encouraging chance encounters. We want to get people out of the boardroom.\u201d Samsung has had a base here for 30 years, housed in a cluster of nondescript sheds, but this 10-storey beacon is designed to shift its brand image in North America from purveyor of fridges and washing machines to powerhouse of cutting-edge semiconductor innovation. Designed by NBBJ, an architecture firm that is conjuring futuristic jungle-filled biospheres for Amazon in Seattle and a handful of vast tech offices across China, the building is the product of research into behavioural psychology and the neuroscience of work.     Techie jungle \u2026 liana-like cables and stuffed leopards at Facebook\u2019s HQ, the biggest continuous office floor in the world. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright for the Guardian    \u201cIt\u2019s all about mobility,\u201d says architect Scott Wyatt, who heads NBBJ\u2019s corporate workplace division. \u201cIf you sit down for more than 20 minutes, you get dumber.\u201d Walking outdoors, he says, is when your brain achieves optimum cognitive function, so the Samsung office is configured to get people out of their chairs as much as possible. With pairs of floors separated by an outdoor terrace, employees are never more than a floor away from stepping outside. The cafeteria, meanwhile, is housed in a separate star-shaped building, so they have to walk out to lunch \u2013 where 10 kinds of global cuisine are on offer in a food court worthy of an upscale mall.    If you sit down for more than 20 minutes, you get dumber    Samsung\u2019s fun-filled office-cum-wellness-centre is just the latest in a wave of new flagship headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area that mark a radical departure for the tech industry, which has never much cared for its surroundings before now. Norman Foster is busy erecting a doughnut-shaped flying saucer for Apple, set in a 150-acre park in Cupertino, where 3.7 miles of curved glass will soon encase a continuous tube of offices, built to the precision of an iPhone. Not to be outdone, Google has hired two of the most fashionable designers of the moment, Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick, to concoct a retro-futuristic fantasyland of plug-in work pods beneath swooping glass tents. Such dreamy visions mark a recent and radical shift from the tech world\u2019s default setting of the generic suburban business park. \u201cMicrosoft always said the buildings don\u2019t matter,\u201d says Wyatt, who has worked on countless projects for the Bill Gates empire. \u201cThe tech attitude was: \u2018Just give me a garage.\u2019\u201d All that has changed. With increasing competition to attract the best young minds, the silicon giants are now racing to outdo each other with ever more elaborate facilities (filled with ever more bountiful snacks). The mother of all pimped-up garages now rambles along the highway in Menlo Park, 15 miles west of Samsung\u2019s HQ, standing like a line of conjoined aircraft hangars piled up in a car crash. With walls jutting out at odd angles and zig-zagging staircases casually bolted on as if at random, it bears the unmistakable hand of Frank Gehry. Stretching across 40,000 square metres, his Facebook headquarters is a hymn to the beloved startup foundation myth of the loose-fit inventor\u2019s shed.

Photograph: Tim Griffith    Housing the biggest continuous office floor in the world, seating around 3,000 workers in an open-plan jumble, it is a suitably gargantuan home for a social network that now counts one fifth of the world\u2019s population in its membership. Walking the office floor feels like exploring a techie jungle, where lianas of cables dangle from the seven-metre-high ceiling, servicing \u201cpods\u201d of programmers, while novelty helium balloons sway above their adjustable standing desks. \u201cWe encourage people to \u2018hack\u2019 their space,\u201d says my young tour guide, as we navigate this rough and ready world of raw steel beams and exposed ductwork, passing a pi\u00f1ata modelled on Donald Trump, a leopard in a pink cape and a life-size stuffed polar bear. \u201cWe\u2019re only 1% finished connecting the world, so we wanted the building to look unfinished too.\u201d   Related: Office makeover: 'If you can work anywhere, where do you want to work?'    Freestanding plywood meeting rooms are daubed with colourful murals from resident artists, while other walls are plastered with motivational posters, made by the company\u2019s print studio, the Analogue Research Lab, featuring ominous mottos such as: \u201cEventually everything connects.\u201d \u201cWhen Zuck [CEO Mark Zuckerberg] says something in the morning,\u201d one Facebooker tells me, \u201cit can become a poster slogan by the afternoon.\u201d At the top of a dog-leg staircase, in a moment of Alice in Wonderland revelation, we come to a nine-acre rooftop park, a bucolic idyll of sloping lawns and wireless-enabled wildflower meadows that look out across the marshy rust-coloured flats of the bay. Cranes are busy building housing next door (which, although partly funded by Facebook, the company insists is not the rumoured \u201cZeetown\u201d for its workers), while volunteers set up marquees on the roof for \u201cglobal causes day\u201d, an annual charity initiative. \u201cNo one pays attention to how much you\u2019re at your desk,\u201d says my guide. \u201cAs long as you get your work done, you can be lying on the lawn or sitting at the grilled cheese bar.\u201d     Tai chi garden \u2026 Samsung HQ. Photograph: Tim Griffith    Free food on tap is a fundamental part of the tech workplace, and Bay Area companies have long competed over the breadth of their snack offering. But the stakes are now shifting towards health-conscious choices: the ubiquitous jars of jelly beans and M&Ms are increasingly supplanted by dehydrated broccoli florets and kale crisps, washed down with a gulp of Soylent. Google has rearranged its snack counters so you have to pass fresh fruit before you reach the candy, while in the cornucopic cafeteria of LinkedIn\u2019s new San Francisco HQ, a wall lists all the local suppliers, beneath the slogan: \u201cKnow your farms, know your food.\u201d \u201cI like to start my day with a kimchi rice bowl, or maybe some sushi,\u201d says one LinkedIn employee, as we stroll around the never-ending buffet. \u201cWe have an in-house pastry chef whose cakes are to die for and eight flavours of homemade ice cream.\u201d Sheathed in a sinister cloak of faceted black glass, somehow befitting the professional networking site, LinkedIn\u2019s new 26-storey tower is a vertical promenade of tech office cliches. We pass the wireless headphone rack of a \u201csilent disco\u201d zone and a Nerf missile play area, then a \u201cpillow fight\u201d meeting room and a \u201cpost your own haiku\u201d wall, each space exuding the forlorn air of a besuited businessman trying to be wacky. Leaving the offices, we pass through a corridor where a distorted trompe-l\u2019oeil mural makes a slogan appear to float in thin air, filling your field of vision with bold capital letters: \u201cFOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS.\u201d     Airbnb\u2019s bedouin tent meeting rooms. Photograph: Mark Mahaney/Mark Maheny    A few blocks away, one of the region\u2019s fastest growing companies is rapidly filling the floors of a former paper factory, where it has converted the industrial spaces into a theatrical playground of themed work zones. At Airbnb, you can have your meetings in a log cabin or a Milanese loft apartment, a bedouin tent or a replica ramen cafe \u2013 each space meticulously recreated from the website\u2019s holiday rental listings. According to the company\u2019s in-house Environments team, it\u2019s about \u201chow we can create spaces that are home-like, but highly effective, functional spaces that allow people to do great work, but hopefully in ways that surprise us.\u201d Some people nestle in bean bags, hunched over their laptops on a stepped seating terrace, others meet in an Airstream caravan, while studious types can squirrel themselves away in leather armchairs in a dimly lit study. At the centre of it all, in a defining moment of startup nostalgia, is a meeting room modelled on the apartment down the road where the company first began. If the office is trying to be a physical manifestation of the company\u2019s motto \u2013 \u201cBelong anywhere\u201d \u2013 it all feels a bit like a budget version of the Crystal Maze, each set decorated with props sourced from eBay or Etsy, and built with the longevity of a shop-window display.     Time to noodle \u2026 ramen cafe-themed meeting room at Airbnb\u2019s HQ. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright for the Guardian    Out on the street, leaving the living wall-lined lobby, you\u2019re confronted with a stark symbol of one of the symptoms of the success of this room-letting behemoth, in the form of a type of enclosure that doesn\u2019t make it into the themed office landscape: the tents of a homeless encampment, huddled beneath the flyover. It is a reminder of the side-effects that the booming tech industry is having on the immediate context outside its hermetically sealed, candy-coated walls. The recent influx of companies from the valley to the city, lured here by considerable tax incentives, is not only increasing rents but bringing other unexpected consequences. \u201cTech offices can have a kind of deadening effect on the city,\u201d says Allison Arieff of SPUR, a non-profit urban research centre. \u201cBecause they now provide their employees with everything on site for free \u2013 from coffee to dry-cleaning to haircuts \u2013 local businesses are often forced to close down when they move in.\u201d For all their talk of community and the commons, the dotcoms are proving to be some of the least civic-minded businesses around. As a gesture of public goodwill, LinkedIn\u2019s tower gives a vast chunk of its ground floor over to an airy \u201cpublic room\u201d, where you may sit and have your lunch and use the Wi-Fi, but San Franciscans won\u2019t be so easily persuaded. \u201cNobody cares about your tech job,\u201d reads a poster on a nearby lamppost. \u201cBe courteous to others when in public and keep the feral careerism of your collegial banter on mute. Or get mugged. We can hear you.\u201d",
