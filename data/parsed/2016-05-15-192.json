  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull has announced a $54m program for diabetic children, on a day his campaign sought to stay positive in the face of a doctors\u2019 revolt over a Medicare funding freeze and a triumphalist campaign launch from Tony Abbott. On Sunday the New South Wales premier, Mike Baird, helped launch Abbott\u2019s re-election bid for his north Sydney seat of Warringah at the Queenscliff surf life saving club. Baird praised Abbott, who he said \u201cwill go down in history as the most effective outstanding leader of opposition we have ever seen\u201d. He predicted \u201cin years to come they will reflect on his time as prime minister as an incredibly positive time for this country\u201d.    Related: Tony Abbott says he does not think Liberals will make him leader again    Abbott boasted of his achievements in government including scrapping the carbon and mining taxes. \u201cThey said you\u2019d never be able to do it but we did,\u201d he said. \u201cWe even managed to do it with the existing Senate.\u201d  \u201cWe made a very strong start to the task of budget repair, and most of all, my friends, we kept this country safe ... So yes, this is my legacy, this is Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s legacy, this is our legacy, and that\u2019s why it is so important that we re-elect a Coalition government on July 2.\u201d  Abbott said he would be a standard bearer for the Liberal and conservative values that made Australia great, and \u201cto be part of the best possible government\u201d. Turnbull said he didn\u2019t catch the launch, but might kayak across Sydney harbour to help Abbott campaign in Warringah. Turnbull had one campaign stop in the south-western Sydney marginal seat of Macarthur, where he and the health minister, Sussan Ley, announced the government would spend $54m on continuous glucose monitoring technology for children and young adults under 21 years old. \u201cOur commitment is estimated to benefit as many as 4,000 children and young adults, and could save the average family up to $4,000 per year off the cost of managing their child\u2019s type 1 diabetes,\u201d he said. The policy would help reduce possible visits to emergency departments and missed school days by allowing families and children to better self-manage their diabetes, he said. \u201cMost importantly, it will help reduce stress and anxiety for children and their parents, and even save lives.\u201d Turnbull was asked about the Australian Medical Association campaign against the government\u2019s decision to extend the Medicare indexation freeze until 2020. The campaign warns patients \u201cyour health will cost you more\u201d and describes the indexation freeze as a \u201cco-payment by stealth\u201d:    What we have is a copayment by stealth @amapresident #nomedicarefreeze #auspol pic.twitter.com/bytZOotc5f\u2014 AMA Media (@ama_media) May 15, 2016    Turnbull pointed to figures that show despite the indexation having been frozen since 2013, bulk-billing rates have climbed to 85%. \u201cSo the experience to date has been that more Australians, not fewer Australians, are paying no more when they go and see their GP,\u201d he said. Shorten appeared at Kingscliff beach in the northern New South Wales electorate of Richmond to announce $40.9m for kids\u2019 swimming lessons. He said the investment would support the states and territories working with government, Catholic and independent schools, local swim schools and lifesaving clubs to ensure every student has access to a swimming and water safety program.  \u201cThe water safety education Australian children receive depends on where they live and in some cases, on their parents\u2019 income level,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cNot every Australian child is receiving the necessary instruction in swimming and water safety.\u201d Shorten fended off questions about attorney general, George Brandis\u2019, call for him to disendorse Dunkley candidate Peta Murphy for supporting a 2009 Liberty Victoria submission arguing against stronger terror laws. He questioned whether Brandis would make the same call about Liberal candidate for Goldstein, Tim Wilson, who opposed laws preventing journalists from reporting on intelligence agencies\u2019 prescribed operations.   Related: Campaign catchup: leaders go head-to-head in front of election diehards    Shorten described Murphy as a \u201ccapable candidate\u201d and said Liberty Victoria, of which she was a member, made the submission but they weren\u2019t her personal views. Shorten attacked Turnbull, who he said had used the Friday leaders\u2019 debate to \u201cdeliberately set up to create a false impression in the mind of Australian voters at the pathology issue is over\u201d. The government announced on Friday it will help pathologists tackle unfair rent to keep their costs down, but will not overturn a $650m cut to the bulk-billing incentive for pathology and diagnostic imaging. Shorten said: \u201c[Turnbull] should be ashamed of what he said. This issue is only delayed, not fixed.\u201d \u201cThey have resolved another issue about the cost of rent, but they have not resolved the bulk billing issue.\u201d",
