According to reports, Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian are heading to Cuba, which may leave the Cuban people wondering if the recent rapprochement with the US is really all that. Cuba isn\u2019t an obvious choice for the Kardashians. It\u2019s not great for shopping, what with the trade embargo, and the family may find it tricky to update their Instagram accounts with Cuba\u2019s restricted internet access (one expects they\u2019ll find a way). So, what can we expect from the Kardashians\u2019 trip, as seen through their various media channels? The three of them perched on a mint-green 1950s Chevy, obviously. A selfie in front of a Che Guevara mural (\u201c#Our every action is a battle cry against imperialism [heart emoji] [smiley face]\u201d)? On previous international missions, the Kardashians have raised awareness of a historic massacre (\u201cToday marks the 100 year anniversary of Armenian Genocide!\u201d) and paid a charitable visit to an orphanage in Thailand (\u201cI told Kanye I was like, honestly, this girl is so sweet and so cute, like, I would totally adopt her,\u201d said Kim on the Kardashians\u2019 reality show). Kim, in particular, is comfortable with talks with world leaders; she met the Armenian prime minister during her trip there last year. Here\u2019s hoping she gets to meet Fidel Castro, so the world can have a lasting record of his feelings about the world\u2019s foremost reality star and one of the most influential women in the world. We haven\u2019t heard much about his opinions on celebs since Naomi Campbell reported that the former leader had complimented her on becoming the first black model to appear on the cover of Vogue and said he was impressed that Kate Moss had \u201cstarted the revolution of little models\u201d. I know, it\u2019s like when Guevara took Havana. \u201cI suppose we were both revolutionaries in his eyes,\u201d Campbell added. Pray that Kastro delivers.",
