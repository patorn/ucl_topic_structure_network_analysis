The stakes truly could not get any higher, yet many of us steadfastedly refuse to change our behaviour.  What\u2019s it going to take? It\u2019s a question being asked more and more. Slowly, we\u2019re gathering the data to begin answering it.    Related: It's spring: stop using your dryer already    First, we\u2019ve learned a lot about what doesn\u2019t work, and why. In his book, What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming, psychologist Per Espen Stoknes explains that focusing on scare tactics doesn\u2019t serve to motivate. Quite the opposite, in fact.  In an interview with Yale Environment 360, Stoknes says, \u201cWhat we know from psychological studies is that if you overuse fear-inducing imagery, what you get is fear and guilt in people, and this makes people more passive, which counteracts engagement.\u201d This link between engagement and efficacy is underscored by the results of virtual reality experiments carried out by Stanford University, where individuals are immersed in virtual reality nature settings and then asked to carry out tasks like cutting down trees. The effects of these experiments have proven to create both striking and long-lasting positive changes in the participants\u2019 behavior relating to environmental issues.  An article explaining the experience sums it up quite neatly: \u201chumans\u2019 willingness to shift behavior is directly correlated to our sense of control.\u201d  It makes sense. If we feel afraid and innefectual, there is little motivation to act. What good would it do? The task seems too great; the chance of success, too slim.  Surprisingly, although increasing our sense of control works to increase eco-friendly behaviour, focusing purely on the effects of individual action (like I tend to in this column, ahem) often proves quite ineffective in motivating people to act.  To put it bluntly, a recent study found that \u201cthinking about climate change from a personal perspective produced little to no change in behavior\u201d. What did work? When researchers framed climate change within the framework of collective responsibility. Respondents consistently demonstrated a greater dedication to environmental issues (measured by the amount they were willing to donate to fight climate change) when considering collective causes of and solutions to climate change, instead of their own individual actions.  Similarly, a separate series of studies conducted over a two-year period indicated that asking participants to consider what kind of legacy they hoped to leave behind caused an increase in what the researchers call \u201chelping behaviour\u201d, especially regarding environmental causes. In essence, being asked to consciously think about the way they would be remembered by future generations caused people to act in more environmentally-friendly ways.  What these peeks into our psychological landscapes reveal is that we like to have an effect on the world around us. We like to have control, make our mark, and be remembered in a positive light. We like to work together, rather than feeling like fate of the world rests solely on our imperfect shoulders.  Perhaps most importantly \u2013 especially for those embedded within the often-depressing world of the environmental movement \u2013 there needs to be a light at the end of the tunnel. It\u2019s not enough to count the species lost to extinction or measure the melting ice caps; there must be stories that go beyond the damage we\u2019ve already done. We need stories about how to repair this earth, regenerate lost landscapes and reclaim dead ecosystems. Indeed, in his interview, Stoknes argues that rather than wallowing in morose pessimism, we need to be doing a far better job of spinning the story.  Environmentalism needs to be identified as more than just a good deed and called what it is \u2013 an incredible opportunity. There will always be small segments of the population who will be eco-friendly even when its expensive, inconvenient or unpopular, but for the rest, we need a far better sales pitch.  \u201cWe need to flip the barriers over so they become successful strategies,\u201d says Stoknes. \u201cRather than doom, we need to emphasize the opportunities that the crisis affords us. Climate change is an opportunity for economic development \u2013 an entire energy system has to be redesigned from the wastefulness of the previous century to a much smarter mode of doing things. It\u2019s a great opportunity to improve global collaboration and knowledge sharing and to create a more just society.\u201d So, what\u2019s it going to take? Now we know. An expanded focus and a shifting story: identifying opportunities, not just consequences. Cultivating stories of resilience, rather than catastrophy. Championing collective responsibility, rather than lone do-gooders against the world.  And hope. Above all, it\u2019s going to take a hell of a lot of hope.",
