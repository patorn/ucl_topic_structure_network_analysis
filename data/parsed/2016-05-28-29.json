Labour MPs said they were shocked that no response had apparently been sent and added that it was further evidence of the party leadership\u2019s slow and inadequate response to the crisis. After Ken Livingstone was suspended from the Labour party at the end of April for making highly controversial remarks about Hitler and Zionism, Isaac Herzog, leader of the Israeli Labour party, wrote to Corbyn, saying he was \u201cappalled and outraged by the recent instances of anti-semitism by senior Labour party officials in the United Kingdom\u201d. Livingstone said on the Vanessa Feltz Show on Radio London last month: \u201cWhen Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel.\u201d Corbyn was forced to suspend his ally for the remarks. Herzog invited Corbyn to bring a delegation to Yad Vashem to witness that the last time the Jews were forcibly transported \u201cit was not to Israel but to their deaths\u201d. An Israeli Labour party official confirmed that it had \u201cnot had a reply\u201d after rumours circulated in the Jewish community in London that no response had been received in Jerusalem or issued from London. Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, who was one of several MPs who held a private meeting with Corbyn last week to discuss antisemitism, said: \u201cIt should be a matter of common courtesy to reply to a letter from the leader of one of our sister parties, particularly on an issue as important as tackling antisemitism. But this is fairly typical of the flat-footed and lackadaisical attitude that we\u2019ve seen from the outset. It is simply unacceptable.\u201d Ian Austin, MP for Dudley North, said he was shocked that the party had not sent Herzog a reply. After Livingstone\u2019s suspension, Corbyn established an independent investigation under the chairmanship of the former head of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti. The Labour leader also reassured MPs last week that he was treating the matter as a high priority. Now it has emerged that Livingstone\u2019s Saturday morning radio show has been dropped by LBC in the wake of the controversy. He had presented the politics show for eight years with David Mellor. LBC, which is owned by Global Radio, the UK\u2019s largest commercial radio operator, decided not to renew the contracts of both presenters. Livingstone had appeared on LBC\u2019s Saturday show as a guest in the wake of the antisemitism row, but has not been on the station since then. \u201cI was told on Monday that my contract would not be renewed,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cIt was an annual contract and doesn\u2019t run out until the end of July/early August.\u201d Meanwhile, a Labour activist, Jackie Walker, who was suspended this month over claims about antisemitism, had her suspension lifted. The Kent activist, who is also a member of the pro-Corbyn Momentum movement, described the past few weeks as \u201ca living nightmare\u201d. According to BBC reports, Walker had written about \u201cthe African holocaust\u201d and Jews as \u201cchief financiers of the sugar and slave trade\u201d. She accused the \u201crightwing press\u201d and people opposed to Corbyn\u2019s leadership of having \u201cprovoked\u201d her suspension. \u201cI am glad this investigation has fully cleared me of any wrongdoing,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not a racist, but I robustly defend my right and the right of others to speak openly and frankly about matters of grave political and historical importance. That is the cornerstone of the right of free speech in our democracy.\u201d She added: \u201cWhat I have suffered and the effect [it] has had on my health, and also on my family, can only be described as the lowest form of \u2018attack politics\u2019.\u201d",
