A new book, Every Song Ever, by the New York Times critic Ben Ratliff, offers cunning methods of linking disparate genres. But for a life-changing examination of how classical music in the 20th century can encompass and reflect the cultural and political upheavals of its time, Alex Ross\u2019s magisterial survey The Rest is Noise is truly essential reading.     If the book has a unifying theme, it might be the strange death of hummable tunes.    This book took my mild curiosity about Mahler and Aaron Copland, and transformed it into a full-blown obsession with Richard Strauss, Arvo P\u00e4rt and everybody in between.  Ross, who is music critic at the New Yorker, knows a minor sixth from a major seventh, but he deploys his technical expertise to clear and compelling effect so it never feels alienating. Here he is describing a section of Messiaen\u2019s monumental Turangal\u00eela-Symphonie: \u201c[The] chord is played as a slow, slinky arpeggio, in the manner of a cocktail lounge pianist. There might as well be a chanteuse in a tight dress leaning to the side.\u201d If the book has a unifying theme, it might be the strange death of hummable tunes. Ross argues that the discordant harmonies that drowned out romanticism with the premiere of Strauss\u2019s Salome in 1906 rippled out to jazz, film soundtracks and television cartoons.

Photograph: Imagno/Austrian Archives    These weird sounds may have since lost some of their power to shock but as Ross points out: \u201cNothing in the annals of music scandal \u2013 from the first night of Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring to the release of the Sex Pistols\u2019 Anarchy in the UK \u2013 rivals the ruckus that greeted Schoenberg.\u201d  Ross deftly establishes the connections between, say, Stockhausen and Bj\u00f6rk, or Edgar Var\u00e8se and Frank Zappa. And he also highlights how JFK\u2019s cold war cosmopolitanism allowed American composers such as Milton Babbitt the leeway to bamboozle audiences with atonal polyphony, while successive leaders of the Soviet Union regarded avant garde compositions as a dead end \u2013 occasionally literally for the composers. True to the spirit of his inclusive approach, Ross\u2019s mission to explain continues at his admirable website. It should be your next stop after navigating the thrilling journey mapped out in his award-winning book \u2013 with your streaming service of choice close to hand, of course. The Rest is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century by Alex Ross is published by 4th Estate.  We\u2019re looking for Guardian members to recommend new and classic books to fellow readers.
