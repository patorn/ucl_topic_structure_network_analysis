  "body": "First, the positive. Hibernian\u2019s status as the butt of so many jokes has now been removed. In a moment where time appeared to freeze, Liam Henderson\u2019s corner was met by the head of David Gray in ending a 114-year wait for Scottish Cup glory. Poetically, the winner arrived in stoppage time. Glory, Glory to the Hibees as the old song dictates. This Hibs vintage of 2016 has thereby been afforded legendary status by stepping where so many before them, including wonderful teams, could not. Logan, Gray, Hanlon, Fontaine, Fyvie, McGeouch, Stevenson, McGinn, McGregor, Stokes, Cummings, Henderson, Keatings and Gunnarsson will roll from the tongues of Hibs fans forever more. They have captured the Holy Grail when led by Alan Stubbs. After so many decades of hurt, bordering on torture at times, only the seriously churlish would deny Hibs their basking in epic glory. Good on them. Nonetheless, Hibs\u2019 triumph came at an immediate cost to reputation. The scenes that arrived at full-time, and will provide enduring images of the 131st Scottish Cup final, were despicable. Laughing them off as excessive jubilation would be a scandal in itself. Plenty have already tried. This was easily the worst Scottish football scene since the infamous Hampden riot of 1980.   Related: Hibernian condemn crowd trouble which marred Cup win over Rangers    For thousands of Hibs supporters to invade the Hampden playing surface with a desire to celebrate, haul down goalposts and claim turf \u2013 as plenty did \u2013 is dubious but perhaps understandable. The problem was perfectly obvious; an element took it upon themselves to immediately head to the Rangers end of the ground and goad the opposition. Physical confrontation with the defeated players was also apparent before police horses arrived to belatedly restore at least an element of calm. Why any individual would choose to mark such a wonderful moment in their club\u2019s history with such antics is utterly baffling. Some of the Rangers following had responded by entering the field themselves, in itself worthy of condemnation despite provocation. The fighting that ensued could conceivably have been worse but was horrible enough to offer a shameful image of Scottish football to an audience who had earlier been treated to an excellent match. The Rangers players could not so much as receive their medals in public, while Hibs were denied a lap of honour. Only those in Cloud Cuckoo Land can believe there is any chance of the push to sell alcohol at Scottish grounds succeeding in the near future. Supporters aside, the failure of authorities to appropriately control what was transpiring before their very eyes was a scandal. In part, they understated what this meant to Hibs. Perhaps the Scottish FA will charge itself with an inability to properly preside over a cup final. Rod Petrie, the Hibs chairman and a vice-president of that governing body, bizarrely met the media and praised the \u201cprofessional manner\u201d with which events were dealt with. Petrie repeatedly pointed to \u201cover exuberance\u201d as an explanation. \u201cYou guys should be writing about five great goals and our success after years of toil and effort. That\u2019s the story,\u201d asserted Petrie, delving into the territory of flat earth. This reflected exceptionally poorly on both Petrie, his club and his SFA position. \u201cBehaviour that is unacceptable should be punished,\u201d Petrie eventually added, after castigating one journalist for \u201cexaggerating\u201d. It was Gray, unwittingly of course, who lit the touchpaper. Hibs had led through Anthony Stokes inside three minutes, the opening blow of a terrific first half. Kenny Miller restored parity with a fine header after James Tavernier crossed from the right. Stokes, his strike partner Jason Cummings and John McGinn all had opportunities to endorse what was lengthy Hibs superiority in the early stages with more goals. Instead, Rangers gradually gained a foothold in the second half and edged in front through Andy Halliday\u2019s long-range, powerful drive. For so long, Hibs\u2019 bottle had been questioned. They were now expected to wilt. Instead? Henderson\u2019s first, key outswinging corner was met at the near post by the outstanding Stokes. Even better was to follow. Hibs had commonly been castigated for their failure to gain promotion to the Scottish top flight for a second time in succession. Being realistic, this cup win will probably matter more than the league botch to those who sampled disappointment for so long. The victory means Hibs will even take their place in the qualifying phase for next season\u2019s Europa League. Mark Warburton, the Rangers manager, did not attend any post-match press conference. Police Scotland\u2019s assessment of \u201cdisorder and violence\u201d was more valid, in any case. Sadly, the achievement of stunning victory from the jaws of defeat for Hibs and a painful defeat for Rangers had already been overlooked in so many quarters. We have not heard the last of 21 May 2016 at Hampden. Nor should we have.",
