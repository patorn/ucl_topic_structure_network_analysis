  "body": "Blue is my favourite colour. The colour of cloudless skies, Saturday morning jeans and Cillian Murphy\u2019s eyes; what\u2019s not to love? It\u2019s probably your favourite colour, too. I\u2019m pretty sure I read somewhere that blue is the most commonly cited favourite colour. It is precisely because blue was already all around us that the trend for blue shirts is quite easy to miss. Its rise, overtaking the previously ubiquitous white shirt as the subtle fashion statement of the day, is probably the biggest fashion shift of 2016 so far. But because blue shirts were perfectly commonplace long before they became a trend, they have risen uncharted. Unlike, say, the embroidered bomber jacket, which is unmissable as a 0-60, all\u2011cylinders-firing arrival in the fashion marketplace, the blue shirt has moved steadily up the outside lane to become a quiet champion. The blue shirt \u2013 either solid, washed-chambray blue or a blur of blue-and-white stripes \u2013 is the cornerstone of this summer\u2019s style. Take your cropped wide-leg trousers/denim culottes/split-leg midi skirt/high-waisted jeans, and swap out the white shirt/T-shirt you were wearing with them last year for a pale blue shirt, and your look is updated. It really is that easy. A blue shirt strikes a more low-key look than a white one. It\u2019s not a blue collar/white collar thing so much as that, while both can be worn to the office, a white shirt is also what you wear with a tuxedo for formal, black-tie eveningwear. (Caveat: a\u00a0blue shirt doesn\u2019t work with a tux.) Also, while a white one works best indoors, any blue shirt, even in the finest cotton with pearl buttons, is a\u00a0distant cousin of the denim shirt, so feels more suitable for outdoors, and therefore more summery.   Related: What I wore this week: flat white shoes | Jess Cartner-Morley    This is not a trend to wow people with your whizziness, so if that\u2019s your plan, get a cold-shoulder top and a choker. A blue shirt is a\u00a0different kind of fashionability. To\u00a0look modern and of the moment without shouting about it is fashion\u2019s take on virtue signalling. And a blue shirt is all it takes. \u2022 Jess wears shirt, \u00a329.99, zara.com. Jeans, \u00a3289, citizensofhumanity.com. Wedges, \u00a346, topshop.com. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.
