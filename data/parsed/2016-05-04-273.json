  "body": "It is 1.30pm in west London, and the morning shift workers are spilling out of the Noon prepared foods factory to be met by a small but energetic group of Labour party activists. \u201cPlease vote Sadiq Khan on May 5!\u201d says Zahida Abbas Noori again and again, dashing between cars to thrust campaign leaflets through reluctantly opened windows, while other supporters intercept staff members leaving on foot. \u201cNot interested,\u201d says one man, ripping his piece of paper in two as he walks away. Several others among the largely south Asian workforce, split between Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims, pause to scrutinise the leaflet, saying they haven\u2019t decided how to vote. But this area, Southall, is a solidly Labour part of the city, and others give a thumbs up as they leave or a promise that yes, of course, they\u2019re voting for the party\u2019s candidate to replace Boris Johnson as mayor.   Related: London mayoralty: Sadiq Khan urges voters to choose hope over fear    In the week of London\u2019s mayoral election, one might expect these to be comfortable days for Sadiq Khan\u2019s team. Having pulled ahead of his Tory rival Zac Goldsmith at the start of the year, the Tooting MP has since strengthened and extended his lead, with an Opinium survey for the Evening Standard on Tuesday putting him nine points ahead of Goldsmith, with the gap widening to 14 points after second preferences. But there is no one inside Labour \u2013 not least Khan himself, a close ally of Ed Miliband who ran the party\u2019s Westminster campaign in the capital \u2013 who does not carry deep scars from the general election a year ago, when the polls were proved humiliatingly wrong on election night. Khan campaign insiders say they believe their man is ahead, but are extremely reluctant to trust the huge reported margin. And so, accepts Kamaljeet Jandu, chair of the party\u2019s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) executive committee and an active member of Khan\u2019s extended team, all are focussed in the final days on events like this one, and a spirited effort to persuade Labour\u2019s core vote to actually turn up on Thursday. \u201cThe polls have him way ahead, and that could translate into: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t need to go out and vote, others are going to do it,\u2019\u201d says Jandu. \u201cThat\u2019s my fear. It\u2019s our responsibility to make sure people do get out there.\u201d     The campaign of Zac Goldsmith (foreground) has been rubbished by many British Indians for its leaflets targeting London\u2019s Indian and Tamil communities. Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters    Though Goldsmith\u2019s campaign has been widely criticised for highly personal attacks on Khan, attempting to link him to \u201cextremists\u201d he has defended as a lawyer or MP, or to paint his own policies as \u201cradical\u201d, some activists will privately admit to encountering some resistance to their Muslim candidate on the doorsteps. That reluctance is most pronounced in outer boroughs where Labour has historically been more vulnerable.  In ethnically mixed areas such as Southall, the Conservatives have been spending money on highly targeted leaflets to Indian and Tamil voters, apparently based on surname, telling Hindus that Khan\u2019s party wants to tax their family jewellery and Tamils that Khan \u201cwon\u2019t stand up for the Tamil community\u201d. The tactic has been rubbished by many British Indians (\u201can ill-informed and arrogant mailshot,\u201d wrote one blogger on the website DailySikhUpdates.com) and is met with a certain amount of eye-rolling on the streets of west London. \u201cOh yes, we have had so many of these leaflets,\u201d laughs Lal Kumar, behind the counter of a womanswear shop on Southall High Street. Does he know how he plans to vote? \u201cWe will go for Labour.\u201d    Related: 'It's ugly and dangerous': the inside story of the battle to be London mayor    US Chada, owner of a shop selling gold and \u201cUK sweaters\u201d, is almost affronted when asked if he thinks attempts to link Khan to controversial Muslim figures will put off his fellow Sikhs or Hindu voters. \u201cI have never discussed this with anybody.\u201d He has a Khan campaign poster in his window but is voting Conservative, he says, because he knows the candidate in his home area of Northwood. The Goldsmith campaign has consistently denied it is exploiting ethnic stereotypes. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s been a negative campaign,\u201d says Greg Stafford, leader of the Conservative group on Ealing council. \u201cI think it\u2019s a campaign that has been highlighting a number of [Khan\u2019s] faults, and Sadiq has done exactly the same [about Goldsmith]. I think people are very sceptical about Sadiq\u2019s record.\u201d But will it work? \u201cIt is perfectly appropriate to target different types of voters, but when you target leaflets by surname there are pros and cons,\u201d says Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a non-partisan thinktank looking at issues of integration and identity. \u201cAn older, first-generation Indian might like it, but the British-born audience might say, could I not have had the leaflet about the 94 bus instead? \u201cThe Conservative strategists might be asking themselves, if they find themselves dog-whistling in a city where there maybe aren\u2019t enough dogs any more.\u201d That may be reflected in Labour\u2019s internal polling, which has not detected any measurable effect of the highly targeted messages, according to a source close to the Khan campaign. But there is a palpable terror of complacency among activists. Sen Kandiah, a Tamil Labour activist, says Goldsmith has greatly misjudged Tamil voters, who he expects to be solidly behind Khan. He admits to concerns, however, that some Hindu or white working-class voters may be more vulnerable to the Tory attacks. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to tell you [on the doorstep], but in the ballot box they can do what they want to do. \u201cThat is why as a Labour man I am not taking anything for granted. We are working hard until the end in a last push for Sadiq.\u201d",
