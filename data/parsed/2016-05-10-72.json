  "body": "The speaker of the house, Paul Ryan, has said he is \u201cnot ready\u201d to endorse Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy. This is problematic for Trump \u2013 Ryan is also chair of the Republican National Convention \u2013 but hardly surprising. I was a little surprised to hear that in retaliation Sarah Palin had endorsed Ryan\u2019s rightwing rival in a Wisconsin primary, but not because it didn\u2019t sound like her. I just thought, someone is running to the right of Ryan? How? When Ryan was picked to be Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012, he was considered a Tea Party favourite. The statistician Nate Silver maintained that, based on his voting record, Ryan was the most conservative vice-presidential candidate in a century. This was a man who gave copies of Ayn Rand\u2019s novel Atlas Shrugged to his staff as Christmas presents. He may have since distanced himself from Rand\u2019s objectivist philosophy \u2013 too atheist \u2013 but politically, Ryan doesn\u2019t leave you much room to pass him on the right.         \u2018Nehlen is presently starring in a deeply weird campaign ad.\u2019     So who is this rival now labouring under the weight of Palin\u2019s endorsement? It\u2019s the businessman Paul Nehlen, a former Ryan supporter whose main beef with Ryan is over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Nehlen is presently starring in a deeply weird campaign ad that shows him riding a Harley through rural Wisconsin, tattooed shoulders bare. He\u2019s not wearing a helmet, although he later turns up in a factory with safety glasses on, accusing Ryan of championing TPP, and challenging him to a debate. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t want to debate me,\u201d he says, \u201cmaybe we can arm-wrestle.\u201d The merits of TPP need not concern us here, since Ryan is actually a vocal critic of the trade agreement as it stands, as are the Democrats Clinton and Sanders, as well as Trump. And I\u2019m not sure why Nehlen is certain he can beat Ryan at arm-wrestling. In my experience, it\u2019s not even always about how big your arms are. It doesn\u2019t sound as if Nehlen means to outflank Ryan on the right; he\u2019s just trying to be the more unhinged candidate. Thanks to Trump, there\u2019s still plenty of room on that side of the road. A satisfying gut feeling   Related: Probiotic goods a 'waste of money' for healthy adults, research suggests    The news that probiotic drinks don\u2019t really do anything for you \u2013 a review of seven major trials has found \u201cno convincing evidence\u201d that they have any effect at all on the gut bacteria of healthy people \u2013 is the kind of story that gladdens my heart a little. It\u2019s like hearing that blindfolded wine experts can\u2019t tell the difference between red and white. I didn\u2019t believe the wine thing \u2013 although I wanted to \u2013 until my son directed me to a well-known experiment at the University of Bordeaux in 2001 involving oeneology students and glasses of the same white wine, some of which had been dyed red. I suppose it\u2019s the pleasure associated with the overturning of assumptions I never really held anyway: there\u2019s no downside for me. As for reports that flossing is a waste of time, well, I find myself a little overinvested. If it\u2019s true, then I really have wasted a lot of time. Homesick, sweet homesick Outbreaks of norovirus always leave me feeling homesick, because the virus used to be known as the Norwalk virus \u2013 so named, I\u2019d always assumed, after my hometown of Norwalk, Connecticut. It was so successful that now you can catch it anywhere. After the latest outbreak on a cruise ship, I went online to find out why they\u2019d changed the name, only to be sorely disabused: the virus was named after Norwalk, Ohio, which had a significant outbreak in 1968. Norwalk, Ohio, was actually settled by refugees from the real Norwalk, in Connecticut, when the latter was burned by the British in 1779. Ohioans can keep their stupid virus for all I care. They can put up signs at the city limits that say \u201cNorwalk, Ohio \u2013 Home of the Winter Vomiting Bug\u201d. Anyway, Connecticut will always have Lyme\u00a0disease.",
