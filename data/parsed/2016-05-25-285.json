  "body": "While the government will no longer force every state school in England to become an academy through legislation, the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, remains committed to persuading schools to make the transition.  If schools do make the switch, academy status brings changes for the all-important governing body. So what are the main differences for people who are governors of an academy rather than a local authority (LA) school?    Related: Without parent governors, schools face an uphill battle to engage families    They have a different job title  The language around academies is different from that of local authority schools. Local authority schools have governors who sit on a governing board, whereas academies have a two-tier system. At the top are members \u2013 usually two or three people who sit on the board of the trust and only have occasional meetings. They play an important role: they ensure that the academy trust\u2019s charitable objectives are being met, maintain an overview of the effectiveness of the trust structure and have the power to appoint and remove trustees.  Trustees are the people who fulfil the roles traditionally done by governors. Like all school governors, they promote the vision, ethos and strategic direction of the school; are a critical friend to the head and hold them to account for the school\u2019s performance; and oversee the use of resources to ensure money is well spent. Academy trustees are both company directors and charity trustees  Academies have the legal status of companies and are also charitable trusts. This means trustees have the responsibilities of both company directors and charity trustees. They must have the best interests of the academy uppermost in their minds at all times, and have a duty of compliance, ensuring all relevant laws and regulations are followed. As holders of a public office, trustees should also be aware of the Nolan principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. Like all company directors and charity trustees, academy trustees must be autonomous in their decision-making and avoid conflicts of interest. For example, if they are connected to another organisation in the local community, such as a business, their decisions as a trustee must be made independently.  They have direct responsibility for admissions Governors for voluntary controlled schools have to comply with the LA\u2019s admissions arrangements, but academies have to devise and implement their own. This means deciding on the numbers admitted into the school and \u2013 just as importantly \u2013 the oversubscription criteria, which can be one of the most controversial elements of a school\u2019s procedures. Whatever is decided on, arrangements must comply with the schools admissions code and be fair, clear and objective. There must also be an independent appeals panel to deal with parents who petition against a decision not to offer their child a place. They have more specific financial responsibilities Trustees are required to submit annual accounts and returns to the academy trust, Companies House and the Education Funding Agency. They are not allowed to set deficit budgets and must not have a deficit at the end of a financial year. Trusts are not allowed to borrow money either. If a trust is deemed to have failed to run the academy\u2019s finances properly, it is likely to receive a financial notice to improve from the funding agency. The audited accounts must also be published on the trust\u2019s website.  They are not accountable to the local authority In academies, regional schools commissioners (RSCs) and headteacher boards replace local authorities in terms of oversight and accountability. RSCs are responsible for intervening in academies where governance is inadequate, and have wide-ranging responsibilities to get involved when academies are underperforming. There are eight RSCs across eight regions in England; rather than intervening directly, RSCs commission teaching schools and other beacons of excellence in education to improve underperforming schools.  They have different liabilities Trustees often worry about personal liability and whether, if something goes wrong, as company directors and charity trustees they could be held individually responsible. In practice, however, unless they have been grossly negligent, trustees should not worry too much as the government has put in place recommendations regarding academy trustee liabilities in the case of financial difficulties. It\u2019s the board as an entity that is responsible. Even where decisions are taken by an individual governor or a committee of the governing board, provided the decision is taken with what the Charity Commission (pdf) defines as \u201cgenuine, honest intentions or motives, trying to do the right thing, in the interests of the charity\u201d no liability will attach to an individual. However, insurance is available and some trusts have it. As an employer, an academy trust is responsible for the health and safety of pupils and staff. They are required to ensure that systems are in place to ensure regular health and safety audits are carried out. The school governors series is funded by Zurich Municipal.
