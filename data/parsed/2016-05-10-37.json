Over the years, that aphorism could be applied to any of the small spaces the GOP has shouldered its way into: doctor\u2019s offices, classrooms, bedrooms. It seems appropriate, then, that the hill some Republicans want to die on resides in a toilet stall. The last gasp of their flailing culture war \u2013 HB2, North Carolina\u2019s law banning transgender people from deciding what bathroom is most appropriate and safe to use \u2013 stinks. And the justification for the law reeks of the insincere protectionism the GOP routinely uses as an excuse to discriminate. Republicans insist that HB2 simply protects little girls from predators \u2013 just as they claim that laws limiting abortion access protect women from ourselves and our doctors, or that immigration policies protect women from \u201crapists\u201d. It\u2019s amazing how much the GOP seems to care about women\u2019s wellbeing! Given the extraordinary concern Republicans claim to have over sexual violence, you\u2019d think they would be working hard to end it across the board. Rape in the military is so prevalent \u2013 26,000 cases in 2012 \u2013 that it caught the attention of a United Nations human rights panel. Yet the party\u2019s presidential frontrunner believes this level of sexual assault is the predictable outcome of having women serving alongside men.      One in four undergraduate women have been sexually assaulted on their college campus, but the right dismisses these statistics as overblown hysterics. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alone faces three federal investigations into alleged mishandlings of rape cases, and still Governor Pat McCrory believes his time is best spent keeping transgender people from using the bathroom. In fact, McCrory doubled down on HB2 just this week, filing a lawsuit that claims the Department of Justice\u2019s call to abandon the discriminatory legislation is an overreach of federal power. Given the substantial political capital McCrory and others are risking \u2013 Ted Cruz used his presidential campaign\u2019s last breaths on the issue \u2013 you\u2019d think there was an epidemic of transgender people attacking bathroom-goers. But no, that number is just about zero. In stirring remarks on Monday, the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, took note of the absurd defense of HB2: \u201cYou\u2019ve been told that this law protects vulnerable populations from harm \u2013 but that just is not the case. Instead, what this law does is inflict further indignity on a population that has already suffered far more than its fair share.\u201d In fact, the population who is at actual risk in public restrooms are transgender and gender nonconforming people themselves, 70% of whom have been harassed in a restroom. The danger that the GOP has invoked in this battle is one that lives solely in their minds \u2013 minds that aren\u2019t willing to evolve and progress with the rest of the country. A country that doesn\u2019t much care who uses what bathroom. Some Republicans know this is a losing battle, but for those who don\u2019t \u2013 those who would rather feign concern over imaginary sexual assaults than do something about real ones \u2013 a time may soon come when they find themselves unwelcome in any kind of room.",
