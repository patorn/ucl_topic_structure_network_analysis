  "body": "Mary Anne Noland\u2019s obituary has quite the first line: \u201cFaced with the prospect of voting either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, Mary Anne Noland of Richmond chose, instead, to pass into the eternal love of God on Sunday.\u201d    According to this obituary, instead of choosing between Trump or Clinton, this lady went with another choice. pic.twitter.com/Gmd86RmvIM\u2014 R.L. Bynum (@RL_Bynum) May 17, 2016    Noland\u2019s husband Jim told NBC12 one of their sons wrote the opening line as a way for them to carry on her sense of humour, rather than to insult either candidate. Mary Noland is not the only recently deceased whose political wishes were expressed in their obituary \u2013 far from it. It\u2019s not even a particularly new phenomenon. As the Washington Post pointed out earlier this year, there were a number of news stories in 2000 of obituaries asking people to vote for George W. Bush. And they continue to be screenshotted, shared and redistributed via Twitter, Facebook groups and, obviously, articles like these.  If you search obituaries on Legacy.com, you\u2019ll find a Dorothy Revell Anderson of Nashville Tennessee, whose obituary asks: \u201cIn lieu of flowers Mrs. Anderson requested that you do not vote for Hillary Clinton in the Presidential Elections.\u201d The obituary of musician and veteran David Arons, detailing his varied life, is already really interesting even before you get to the final paragraph, which says: \u201cHe recently said his biggest regret would be not living long enough to vote for Hillary Clinton. Perhaps friends and family will consider helping fulfill his last wish by voting for Hillary themselves.\u201d Earlier this year, Donald Trump tweeted the obituary of Ernest Overby (although he appears to have spelt his name wrong), with the final line: \u201cPlease vote for Donald Trump.\u201d    Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. https://t.co/2DZp7YOadj pic.twitter.com/2YtLlEwceB\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2016    Chiropractor Jeffrey H Cohen died aged 70 earlier this year. His obituary, published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said: \u201cJeffrey would ask that in lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Donald Trump.\u201d Of course, among all these genuine obituaries are hoaxes, like this one from \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s cousin\u201d. The entirely fictional Thomas P. Trump declares: \u201cAs a proud bearer of the Trump name, I implore you all, please don\u2019t let that walking mucus bag become out president.\u201d    Fake obituary from realDonaldTrump's cousin implores the public not to vote for him: https://t.co/qs8e8B151k pic.twitter.com/sQ3SJGMWAL\u2014 Cape Town Fairy (@CapeTownFairy) February 5, 2016    It began being widely shared in February after it was posted on Imgur. Fact-checking site Snopes, who really deserve a medal for their debunks, found the picture was actually of a man completely unrelated to Trump, who died in 2008.",
