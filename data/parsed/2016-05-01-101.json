  "body": "Back in 2007, Live at Leeds started to showcase the city\u2019s homegrown talent. Now in its 10th year, it\u2019s one of the UK\u2019s best established street festivals, with 180-plus bands (compared to 2007\u2019s 54) playing at 16 venues. Attendance has also grown massively, from 1,500 to 10,500 punters pressed body-to-body in tiny bars, driving Uber price surges as they rush between distant venues in search of the next best thing. The bill is full of unknowns, but sticking a figurative pin in the map for the first band of the day works out well: ZoZo are a local five-piece with a saxophonist in their ranks. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying us, so you\u2019d better come forward,\u201d singer/guitarist Kang Clinton tells Belgrave Music Hall. It turns out that seeing the whites of Clinton\u2019s eyes is key to ZoZo\u2019s performance. They marry Protomartyr\u2019s post-apocalyptic incantations to brassy postpunk in debt to the Ex. Each member jitters as if he\u2019s short-circuiting, and Clinton\u2019s absurd, overheated gesticulations are funny and unpredictable. For the last song, he shoots across the floor like a bowling ball and disappears, leaving a random bloke to seize the mic and chant along to the frenzied music. They make midday feel like midnight.     Technical problems \u2026 Hannah Lou Clark. Photograph: C Brandon/Redferns    But even the best laid plans have a tendency to go awry. Late-running sets are a big problem, throwing the whole day off as you dash from one silent venue to the next. Over at Holy Trinity church, Hannah Lou Clark has a nightmare: technical issues mean her set starts 30 minutes late, then she does one track \u2013 a plaintive electric-guitar ballad \u2013 only to break a string, stall again, and end up playing just three songs. The breaking down of genre barriers means that pop-leaning acts now get a look-in at ostensibly indie festivals like this. At Headrow House, duo Girli\u2019s cyberpunk Claire\u2019s Accessories aesthetic and vocal fry affectations are meant to be subversive \u2013 they discuss periods and throw \u201cpre-bled\u201d pants into the crowd \u2013 but, unlike Kathleen Hanna\u2019s Valley Girl Intelligentsia, it all seems to be a joke at the expense of teenage girls and pop fans, rather than a provocative spin.  It\u2019s a strange sign of the times that proper indie lads such as Blossoms have finally recognised the power of their teen-girl fans, and adapted accordingly. Following the 1975\u2019s lead, they embrace their floppy-haired heart-throb status at Leeds University union, and bring rolling funk and silvery synths to their robust, devotional guitar pop. There must be 2,000 people in the room; Blossoms will be massive.     Endearing wonder \u2026 Loyle Carner. Photograph: Waytao Shing/Getty Images    For all that Live at Leeds offers, there\u2019s surprisingly little grime or hip-hop. At the Brudenell, Loyle Carner provides a welcome corrective, though he has a more sentimental approach than the genre\u2019s comic, spitting mainstays. Over soulful samples, he raps about his parents and wishing for a little sister. \u201cI tell her, eat her spinach and she\u2019ll see that the skies are limitless,\u201d he imagines, with endearing wonder. Afterwards, to loud cheers, he says that his mum has just told him she\u2019s adopting a little girl.  Despite logistical difficulties resulting from its size, Live at Leeds thrives in intimate moments like this.",
