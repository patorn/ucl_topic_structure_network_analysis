Donald Trump sweeps West Virginia and Nebraska but his wins are overshadowed by news he is sending a prominent white nationalist as a delegate to the summer convention. Sanders focused his message on Trump, saying it is not enough to just reject the Republican candidate \u2013 \u201cthis is an opportunity to define a progressive vision for America\u201d. In a West Virginia exit poll, 43% of Sanders supporters said they\u2019d sooner vote for Trump than Clinton in November. The Guardian\u2019s Lucia Graves says: West Virginia so what? Clinton didn\u2019t need it anyway. Bernie Sanders takes West Virginia as Donald Trump rolls on An \u2018inane jumble\u2019 Republican defense hawks in the Senate who are starting to mark up next year\u2019s Pentagon spending plans are unsparing in their critique of the presumptive presidential nominee\u2019s foreign policy ideas. An \u201cinane jumble of jingoistic sloganeering\u201d neatly covers their take on Trump\u2019s efforts to set out his America First vision.  \u2018An inane jumble\u2019: Trump foreign policy splits GOP on issue party once agreed on Queen Elizabeth rebuffs Chinese leader So much for a \u201cgolden age\u201d of UK-Chinese relations. In a rare diplomatic leak, Queen Elizabeth II was caught in a reality TV moment at her garden party at Buckingham Palace, letting slip that a visiting Chinese delegation was \u201cvery rude to the ambassador\u201d. The slip-up referred to President Xi Jinping\u2019s first state visit to Britain last year. Queen caught on camera saying Chinese officials were \u2018very rude\u2019           \u2018Very rude\u2019: Queen\u2019s unguarded comments on Chinese officials during UK visit    Climate change tipping point A key atmospheric measuring station at Cape Grim in Australia is on the verge of showing CO2 concentrations at 400ppm for the first time. This is a grave marker and suggests carbon dioxide concentrations are teetering on the point of no return and locking the planet into irreversible warming. \u201cWe\u2019re going into very new territory,\u201d says James Butler, of the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  World\u2019s carbon dioxide concentration teetering on the point of no return Power struggle hampers Isis fight As an Isis bomb devastates a Sadr City market, killing at least 66 people, US-backed efforts to rid Iraq of Islamic State are being undermined by internal ethnic and sectarian strife and political torpor. Martin Chulov finds that weak state controls have pitched the Iraqi army in a power struggle with militias and the Kurds, weakening the resolve to confront Isis as the rivals focus on future territorial carve-ups.

Mosul: suspicion and hostility cloud fight to recapture Iraqi city from Isis Prince\u2019s doctor questioned Dr Michael Todd Schulenberg, the physician who prescribed medication to Prince twice in the month before his death, has been questioned by investigators. The search warrant shows investigators interviewed Schulenberg and searched a suburban Minneapolis hospital where he worked but did not specify what medications were prescribed. Warrant says doctor prescribed medication for Prince before death Brazil\u2019s president faces a crucial vote Brazil\u2019s President Dilma Rousseff faces a crucial vote today in the Brazilian legislature that will probably see impeachment proceedings against her approved. Jonathan Watts says Rousseff\u2019s stubbornness and secretive nature made her ill-equipped to stop the trouble that was brewing. Brazilian senate to vote on Dilma Rousseff impeachment Hedge fund kings still rolling in cash The business has been hammered by losses and closures, but hedge fund kings are still commanding massive paydays. The top 25 hedge fund managers earned $13bn in 2015 \u2013 more than the entire economies of Nicaragua, Namibia and the Bahamas. Of those, Kenneth Griffin, founder of Citadel and the wealthiest man in Illinois, and New York\u2019s James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, each made $1.7bn. Top Wall Street bankers are paupers by contrast: the best paid banker last year was JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who collected $27m.

The plan is to promote equality. The new representations include cartoon female engineers, chemists, plumbers and farmers. \u201cNo matter where you look, women are gaining visibility and recognition as never before,\u201d say the designers behind the proposal. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time that emoji also reflect the reality that women play a key role in every walk of life and in every profession?\u201d Google proposes new set of female emojis to promote equality Obama\u2019s lost atomic ambitions Barack Obama\u2019s historic trip to Hiroshima should have been a crowning moment for his ambition to usher in an era of fewer weapons of mass destruction. Sadly, unlike the Enola Gay, gleaming in a Washington museum, his own efforts look more tarnished. Enola Gay is a museum piece, unlike the nuclear arms Obama hoped to eradicate Masters of mankind In part two of an extract from Noam Chomsky\u2019s new book Who Rules the World? the author looks at how a sledgehammer strategy, AKA \u201cthe global war on terror\u201d, has spread jihadi terror from Afghanistan across much of the world. \u201cThe invasion of Iraq made a substantial contribution to this process,\u201d writes Chomsky, \u201cmuch as intelligence agencies had predicted.\u201d If we continue with such brutal policies, he says, the likely effect is even more violence with broader appeal. Part one is here.  Playing by the al-Qaida gameplan: how the war on terror spread jihadi influence Protect children from literature? Er, no thanks Certain subjects \u2013 sex, drink, drugs, violence \u2013 are guaranteed attention-grabbers. But how do you write about them for teenagers?
