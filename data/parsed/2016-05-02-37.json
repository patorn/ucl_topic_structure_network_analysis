  "body": "Five years ago, the Turner prize-winning British artist Martin Creed had an idea \u2013 a secret handshake. It wasn\u2019t for just anyone; it was for his stepdaughter, who was 10 at the time. \u201cWe\u2019d go \u2018peace, love and understanding\u2019 with these hand signals when we were saying goodbye,\u201d says Creed over the phone from his home in London. He and his stepdaughter would make the peace sign together, where they each lifted one finger. They\u2019d make a love heart with the shape of their hands over their chests. And then, they\u2019d make a symbol for understanding by waving their hands, as if they were creating brainwaves between two people. Creed calls it \u201ca hippy thing\u201d, but it became a coping mechanism for stepfamily awkwardness. \u201cWhen I first got to know her, my relationship to her was not clear \u2013 am I her dad? Am I not her dad?\u201d he remembers. \u201cThis was a way to try and communicate with my stepdaughter, but without saying what it is, in a way.\u201d Now, Creed is taking the word \u201cunderstanding\u201d from his secret handshake and emblazoning it in enormous red letters along Brooklyn Bridge Park\u2019s Pier Six in New York City. Overlooking the East river, the 25ft-tall revolving neon sculpture simply says Understanding and is open for interpretation. Created with the Public Art Fund, which puts on major works for all in New York, it ties into Creed\u2019s first US retrospective, which opens at the Park Avenue Armory on 8 June.

Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer    Originally meant to be a three-part work, the piece would have read Peace, Love and Understanding, but proved too expensive. Creed had to edit it down. \u201cI ended up thinking, \u2018Maybe all you need is understanding,\u2019\u201d the artist said. \u201cPeace and love can go out of the window a little bit, they\u2019re absolute ideals, but understanding is possible because it includes that what is not possible.\u201d The sculpture goes beyond his family experience to express his view on the wider political environment. \u201cI think it has to do with the bloody shit going on in the world at the moment,\u201d Creed says. \u201cIt has to do with wars and communicating with people in a way that\u2019s understanding, for lack of a better word.\u201d At the same time, Creed\u2019s sculpture is ultimately personal. \u201cI want to be understood,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody wants. If we have an understanding of other people, or try to understand them and ourselves, it might help a bit.\u201d     Martin Creed in his studio in East London. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Creed has worked in a variety of media, from concepts (his work All the Bells, first performed in Costa Rica and then for the London Olympics, encourages the population of a certain place to ring a bell loudly for three minutes) to paintings. Born in West Yorkshire but brought up in Glasgow, hence his Scottish accent, he won the Turner in 2001. The installation he showed for the prize exhibition was Work No 227: The Lights Going On and Off \u2013 an empty room in which precisely that, and nothing else, happened. Neon signs are an ongoing series for the artist. Sometimes he\u2019s irked, other times he\u2019s inspired \u2013 his emotions filter through his glowing neon works. There are the more hopeful works, like Don\u2019t Worry in lemon yellow, and the blazing white phrase Everything is Going to Be Alright, which was hinged at the Hilton in New York\u2019s Times Square back in 2000. Then there are his more ill-tempered pieces, such as Fuck Off, Shit and Whatever, which tie into his punk roots, as Creed is also a musician who is releasing his next album on 8 July called Thoughts Lined Up.           Martin Creed live session: How I wrote ... Thinking/Not Thinking    This piece, however, is both philosophical and playful. \u201cIt\u2019s a wee bit of a joke that you can stand under understanding,\u201d Creed says.  The rotating sculpture is raised on a platform with stair-like seating to relax by the waterside. As picturesque as it is, the color red was chosen as a contrast to all the bright white lights that pepper the city skyline. \u201cNeon red is one of the most straightforward colors, it is the color of neon gas,\u201d Creed says. \u201cAnd yet, red is a danger color.\u201d Hinting as a warning for the danger the world is in, this is the third and largest of his rotating neon sign pieces after Work No 1357, Mothers from 2012 and Work No 2070, People from 2014.     Mothers, which rotated about 10ft off the ground. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    The artist sees this public sculpture as a way to get out of his own narcissism. \u201cI wanted something that looks to the street, rather than creating a wank world of my own,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m aware art galleries are closed off and people create their own fantasy worlds.\u201d The elite bubble of the art world may look attractive from the outside, but to this insider, that\u2019s what worries him. \u201cI worry about being deluded,\u201d Creed says. \u201cIn order to live your life without committing suicide you have to delude yourself that you are important, that what you do matters. To do things, you subscribe to a confidence-building delusion, which is dangerous to making work, as you can ignore the reality of life.\u201d Pausing, he chuckles, as if he has revealed too much. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he sighs. I can\u2019t help but remember his quirky, self-loathing neon signage, like Feelings, Coconuts and Opium. \u201cI\u2019m trying to look at the outside world and not trust my own interior world,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible, but I try.\u201d Aside from all this, do Creed and his stepdaughter still do their secret handshake? The artist laughs. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that any more,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s 15, so we just say goodbye now. I wouldn\u2019t try to do it because I\u2019d be scared she would give me the brush-off.\u201d  Martin Creed\u2019s Understanding runs from 4 May to 23 October at Brooklyn Bridge Park\u2019s Pier 6, while his retrospective The Back Door at the Park Avenue Armory runs from 8 June to 7 August.      \u2018Maybe all you need is understanding.\u2019 Photograph: Public Art Fund",
