  "body": "Facebook has apologized for banning a photo of a plus-sized model and telling the feminist group that posted the image that it depicts \u201cbody parts in an undesirable manner\u201d.    Related: The \u2018perfect body\u2019 is a lie. I believed it for a long time and let it shrink my life    Cherchez la Femme, an Australian group that hosts popular culture talkshows with \u201can unapologetically feminist angle\u201d, said Facebook rejected an advert featuring Tess Holliday, a plus-sized model wearing a bikini, telling the group it violated the company\u2019s \u201cad guidelines\u201d.  After the group appealed against the rejection, Facebook\u2019s ad team initially defended the decision, writing that the photo failed to comply with the social networking site\u2019s \u201chealth and fitness policy\u201d.  \u201cAds may not depict a state of health or body weight as being perfect or extremely undesirable,\u201d Facebook wrote. \u201cAds like these are not allowed since they make viewers feel bad about themselves. Instead, we recommend using an image of a relevant activity, such as running or riding a bike.\u201d  In a statement on Monday, Facebook apologized for its original stance and said it had determined that the photo does comply with its guidelines. \u201cOur team processes millions of advertising images each week, and in some instances we incorrectly prohibit ads,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis image does not violate our ad policies. We apologize for the error and have let the advertiser know we are approving their ad.\u201d The photo \u2013 for an event called Cherchez La Femme: Feminism and Fat \u2013 features a smiling Holliday wearing a standard bikini. Facebook had originally allowed the event page to remain, but refused to approve the group\u2019s advert, which would have boosted the post.    Related: Tess Holliday: 'Never seen a fat girl in her underwear before?'    The policy in question is aimed at blocking content that encourages unhealthy weight loss \u2013 the opposite intent of Cherchez la Femme, which was promoting body positivity.  This is not the first time Facebook has come under fire for its censorship of photos. In March, the site faced backlash when it concluded that a photograph of topless Aboriginal women in ceremonial paint as part of a protest violated \u201ccommunity standards\u201d.  Critics said that ban was an obvious double standard, noting that Facebook allows celebrities such as Kim Kardashian to pose with body paint covering her nipples.  Instagram and Facebook have also faced opposition for policies banning women from exposing their nipples, with critics arguing that the guidelines are prejudiced against women and transgender users.  Cherchez la Femme vented its frustrations on its Facebook page.   \u201cFacebook has ignored the fact that our event is going to be discussing body positivity (which comes in all shapes and sizes, but in the particular case of our event, fat bodies), and has instead come to the conclusion that we\u2019ve set out to make women feel bad about themselves by posting an image of a wonderful plus sized woman,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe\u2019re raging pretty hard over here.\u201d   Related: Facebook to change trending topics after investigation into bias claims    Jessamy Gleeson, co-producer of the group, said she was initially so shocked by the language in Facebook\u2019s explanation that she didn\u2019t know how to respond.  \u201cI was utterly furious. I couldn\u2019t comprehend it, quite frankly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought it was really horrible and isolating and alienating \u2026 Women with fat bodies can, of course, be as desirable as anybody else.\u201d Gleeson said she was not satisfied with Facebook\u2019s apology and hopes the company will re-examine its policies and address double standards in how it reviews photos of women. \u201cQuite simply they need to understand we can use images of fat women to promote women being happy,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWhat about all the cases that don\u2019t receive this media attention? They\u2019ve been wrong in many other thousands of cases, I\u2019m sure.\u201d",
