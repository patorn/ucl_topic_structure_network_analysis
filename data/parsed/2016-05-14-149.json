  "body": "It\u2019s Saturday night and I\u2019m having dinner at a friend\u2019s house. After dinner has been cleared, someone produces a small bag of cocaine and begins to cut it into lines at the table. I take a gram of cocaine and another of MDMA. I smoke some weed and drink three to four glasses of good red wine. We dance. The 15 of us who have gathered \u2013 old friends, some of whom I\u2019ve known since school \u2013 push aside the coffee table and twirl around the living room, holding hands, laughing and marvelling at how lucky we are to have these exact friends and to be exactly here, in this moment. \u201cYou lot are the best,\u201d we say over and over. I feel as though I\u2019ve never been so happy, so lucky, so brilliant. I am the very best version of myself. I have a deep sense of compassion for every person in the room. I can reveal any part of myself, say anything, no matter how personal or banal. At around 4am, high as kites and exhausted from dancing, we all sit down and play charades. \u201cFilm!\u201d \u201cTwo words!\u201d \u201cJumanji?\u201d It\u2019s not exactly Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. At some point, I think around 9am, we call the dealer again. The prospect of the comedown, an achy, twitching sadness where you can\u2019t stop thinking about a bad thing you said three-and-a\u2011half years ago, seems too awful to bear. Because he won\u2019t come for anything less, we order another 2g of coke and another 2g of MDMA (total cost \u00a3180). At 2pm on Sunday, almost out of white powder and with the working week looming large on the horizon, we go home to nurse our heads. On Monday, we each crawl into work clutching triple-shot americanos and pretending to our colleagues that we\u2019ve had quiet weekends. Take that model, and repeat \u2013 sometimes as much as every weekend for a few months, sometimes as little as once a month \u2013 and you\u2019ve got a pretty accurate picture of how I\u2019ve spent my 20s. I\u2019m now 28 and a writer on a national magazine. I grew up on the outskirts of a city in the north of England, but I\u2019ve lived in London since 2011. I enjoy reading and going to the gym. I take drugs most weekends, but I wouldn\u2019t call myself an addict, any more than someone who spends their weekend drinking gin and tonics and doing shots would call themselves an alcoholic.    In a heavy month, my drug spend can be around \u00a3400. That\u2019s a quarter of my income    But then, I do wonder. My own father died when I was 19 because of complications that arose from his chronic alcoholism. In the bad times, he would drink a bottle of vodka a day. He would steal and lie and get unspeakably angry. Other times, he would be lovely and affable and completely sober. I can\u2019t help but wonder when the habit became an addiction for him. I\u2019ve never allowed myself to linger too much on his memory, because in the end he wasn\u2019t a nice man; but every so often, going past a mirror, I catch a glimpse and pause. I can see him in myself and think that maybe it\u2019s time to stop, or slow down. Perhaps I\u2019m hiding behind excuses; in denial, on the steady downward spiral of someone not ready to admit they\u2019ve got a problem. Of course I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case \u2013 if it were, then almost every friend I have who is living in a major city in the UK has a serious problem. Are we \u2013 me, my nearest and dearest \u2013 actually the happy, dancing-in-the-living-room, social users we see ourselves as? Or have we begun to push through that flimsy membrane? *** One conversation from last week\u2019s party has stuck with me. Bella, 29, is a financial consultant. We\u2019ve known each other since meeting in halls at university. I was bemoaning the fact that we\u2019d been too busy to go to an exhibition and now it was finished. \u201cWell,\u201d she laughed, \u201cwe\u2019re not that busy. We just fill our time doing this.\u201d She gestured to the line of coke I was fashioning with the edge of my gym membership card. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for exhibitions when this is your hobby.\u201d I would truly hate to tot up all the midnight cash withdrawals I\u2019ve made throughout my 20s, the time spent making shady deals late at night in the backs of cars with men you don\u2019t really want to bump into after dark. In a heavy month, my drug spend can be around \u00a3400. That\u2019s a quarter of my income. \u201cBut it\u2019s great,\u201d Bella continued. \u201cCan you imagine me mountaineering or something? I\u2019d rather be here, with you guys, having a good time.\u201d Bravado is easy when you\u2019re high: you\u2019re on top of the world, so of course it\u2019s worth it. But what about after, on a Wednesday night, when work worries are made all the more worrisome by an unshakable anxiety, a feeling that lurks at the edges of your consciousness for a few days after a heavy session. \u201cDid I actually say it was that great?\u201d she laughs a few days later. \u201cYeah, I guess so. But it\u2019s not something I\u2019m overly proud of.\u201d    In the way that others might crave a glass of wine to unwind, I want a line. It\u2019s a guaranteed good time    Like me, Bella has gone through periods of less and more regular usage. I\u2019ve never been able to ascribe a certain mental state to either \u2013 usually, I take more drugs when there are birthdays or other reasons to celebrate \u2013 but for Bella, who in the past has dealt with social anxiety through a combination of CBT and medication, it\u2019s more obvious. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m most anxious, I tend to have heavier weekends, drugs-wise,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t do it consciously, but looking back I can see the pattern. The fact is, taking some coke, or whatever else, makes me feel better, even if that\u2019s short-lived. It\u2019s fun. I feel my stresses fall away for a night. And it\u2019s brought me much closer to all of my friends \u2013 closer than I thought I could be because of my anxiety. I\u2019ve always found it hard to open up because I worry about what people will think of me. In the past, that might have made me seem standoffish, but spending time in these situations has been really liberating.\u201d But the relief can be short-term. \u201cMy comedowns are worse than most people\u2019s, from what I can tell. I get a thought stuck in my head, usually something I\u2019ve forgotten to do that\u2019ll get me into trouble at work, and it\u2019s really hard to get past it.\u201d After a few days, though, those feelings abate. \u201cFriday rolls around and I\u2019m ready to go again. It\u2019s a running joke. Monday to Wednesday you tell yourself you won\u2019t do it this weekend, Thursday you feel OK, Friday you\u2019re back on form.\u201d Alcohol, she agrees, is the gateway drug, and two drinks \u2013 where you feel just tipsy enough to be reckless \u2013 the golden quantity. \u201cAfter two drinks, I want to cut loose,\u201d Bella explains. \u201cIn the way that others might crave a glass of wine to unwind, I want a line. Not every weekend, but usually when work has been stressful. It\u2019s a guaranteed good time.\u201d Bella uses the same dealer every time. Like me, she met hers through friends. We each have a few numbers of reliable guys (it\u2019s always men) whose product is of an OK quality. Bella\u2019s dealer has branded loyalty cards, much like the ones you get at coffee shops. For every pick-up, she gets a stamp. She texts the amount, he drives to meet her wherever she is, and five stamps equal a free gram of cocaine; it\u2019s an audacious but effective method of marketing. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out with a certain set of friends at the weekend, it feels almost inevitable that we\u2019ll do it. Before I know it, one of us is popping outside to meet the dealer and the next few hours are brilliant.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t call this an addiction \u2013 I\u2019ve seen drug addiction. I grew up on an estate, and while I\u2019d be loth to paint too predictable a picture of it (I had a nice childhood and have friends who still live there), drugs were everywhere. My mum still lives in the semi-detached I grew up in, and just last year her neighbour\u2019s house was raided by police. The people living there were dealing heroin (\u201cHe always helped me bring in my shopping, though,\u201d Mum said when I told her I was worried). And it was easy to spot the hollow-eyed, desperate-looking types who would hang around waiting for the dealer to let them in. I can\u2019t relate to that kind of physical need. But then, my friends and I never thought we\u2019d still be doing this within touching distance of 30. And instead of becoming firmer, our self-control has just become more slippery. The older we\u2019ve got, the less we\u2019re inclined to curb our appetites.    I used to call my dealer and pretend there were people with me, so he wouldn\u2019t know I was alone, stocking up    \u201cAddiction doesn\u2019t always look the way people assume,\u201d the Priory\u2019s medical director, Dr Richard Bowskill, tells me. \u201cMaybe people aren\u2019t taking the drug every day or every weekend, but when they do take it, they find it harder to control themselves. They think, \u2018I\u2019ll go out drinking tonight, but I\u2019m not going to have any cocaine.\u2019 Then they end up drinking and taking cocaine. They spend four times more than they thought they would and miss work the following Monday because of their hangover.\u201d This, I explain meekly, sounds suspiciously like my own behaviour. \u201cWell,\u201d Bowskill says, \u201cthat sounds like psychological dependency.\u201d Beyond the psychology, of course, I question how my weekends affect my physical health. When I idly search the internet for the health impact, I find stark warnings that drug abuse can lead to heart disease, lung disease, depression, psychosis, hepatitis C, high blood pressure and schizophrenia (to name a few). Dr Adam R Winstock, psychiatrist and founder of the Global Drug Survey, is sanguine. \u201cThere are lots of happy, functional, regular users of drugs such as cocaine, MDMA and cannabis.\u201d Around 5% of that group, he explains, may encounter an \u201cacute\u201d problem \u2013 say, dehydration, which requires a trip to A&E, or getting too stoned and throwing up. \u201cMost will grow out of drugs as their use becomes incompatible with their lives.\u201d Still, when I press him, he reels off a litany of health problems that I may encounter. For regular, heavy MDMA users, this could be neurotoxicity \u2013 where the normal function of the brain and nervous system is impaired after long-term exposure to toxins. \u201cA lot of studies on MDMA exposure focused on very high doses, taken over long periods of time,\u201d Winstock says, \u201cand found that after a number of years participants suffered from low moods, were more impulsive and that memory was impaired.\u201d Cocaine speeds up the development of atherosclerosis both in the heart and in the brain, \u201cthe furring up of arteries that you normally get when you\u2019re around 60 and you\u2019re a lifelong smoker\u201d. With ketamine, the risk is largely immediate \u2013 users take too much and, as it\u2019s a depressant, find they can\u2019t move or speak (known as a k-hole \u2013 one old university friend of mine k-holed next to a hot radiator, and sat there for so long that it burned her whole left arm). In the long term, Winstock explains, ketamine can cause toxic ulceration of the bladder lining.    It\u2019s the cravings that make me uncomfortable; the feeling, after a few drinks, that a line would make everything better    Of course, like all risk-takers, I have the \u201cit won\u2019t happen to me\u201d mentality that allows me to continue in the same vein. I\u2019m also comforted by the fact that, compared with my peers, I wouldn\u2019t class my use as particularly heavy. \u201cWell, most people don\u2019t,\u201d counters Winstock. \u201cBut based on figures from last year\u2019s Global Drug Survey, 80% of cocaine users take it less than 10 times a year. Similarly, an average dosage of MDMA is 200-400mg. The reality is, in the UK, most people who take party drugs are casual, irregular users for whom it forms only a very small part of their social lives. If your habit is a weekly one, you\u2019re likely to be in the top 5%.\u201d *** For Mary, 25 and an actor, the slide into dependency seemed to happen all too easily. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of myself as having a real problem until my then housemate came into my room, rounded up all the drugs she could find \u2013 which I think amounted to 5-6g of ketamine, some cocaine and a small amount of skunk \u2013 and threw them away. I was really furious with her.\u201d Mary had got into the habit of using ketamine almost daily. \u201cIt was a social, weekend thing, until it wasn\u2019t. It just escalated really quickly. I\u2019d feel awful on a Monday, so I\u2019d have a little bump and feel pleasantly spaced out.\u201d Not having regular work meant it was easy for something she had only ever meant to be occasional to become the defining part of Mary\u2019s life. \u201cI suppose somewhere in the back of my mind I knew that the way I was using wasn\u2019t normal. I would call the dealer and then have to pretend that there were people in my flat or that I was going out to meet friends, so he wouldn\u2019t know I was just on my own, stocking up. I guess I felt like a failure, because I wasn\u2019t getting much work. Going out, drinking and getting high, on the other hand, made me feel good. So I just decided to focus on doing that. \u201cWithin a year I was snorting a gram of ketamine most days. It started like a treat \u2013 a few bumps here and there \u2013 but obviously the quantities kept going up as my tolerance built. The money was coming from part-time jobs, from bits of acting work or from my parents, but I must have spent well into the thousands. My housemate did try to talk to me about it on a few occasions. I think she noticed how weirdly I was behaving, staying in my room for days, eating rarely. To other friends, it wasn\u2019t so apparent.\u201d When her housemate confronted her again, Mary was shocked by the ferocity of her own emotions. \u201cI never saw myself as addicted, because there\u2019d be days when I wouldn\u2019t have anything and be fine. But the thought of not having access to ketamine made me really panicked. I was so angry at my housemate that I tore into her room and started rifling through her clothes and boxes, to see if she\u2019d kept any. She didn\u2019t try to stop me, but I saw my reflection in the mirror and it was really disturbing.\u201d That was a year ago; since then Mary has stopped drinking (\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d trust myself after a few drinks\u201d) and taking all drugs. She has been on the periphery of my group of friends for a few years, but we\u2019ve never discussed this before, and I realise I have seen much less of her lately. \u201cI do find it hard to be around you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re all really laissez-faire about when you do it and what you take.\u201d My mind flashes to a Wednesday night dinner where one of the girls produced a half-empty bag of cocaine. We all dutifully marched to the toilets, leaving Mary alone at the table. \u201cNights are put on hold while someone waits for the dealer to turn up, or go on for hours after I\u2019ve left, so it feels like I\u2019m missing out.\u201d    When do we expect to become \u2018responsible\u2019? I\u2019ll be 30 soon, but feel as if I\u2019ve lived in a state of extended adolescence    For every story such as Mary\u2019s, though, I know five more where the weekend habit remains just that: people who would never dream of doing drugs during work time just as they would never dream of turning up to the office drunk. Like me, these people would argue that their weekend antics have little impact on their working lives. Could my habit go on for years without ever turning into addiction? This is how Bowskill explains the difference: \u201cIf the frequency is about once a week, the amount stays around the same and there are no social consequences \u2013 no arguments, no debts, no aggressiveness or risk-taking behaviour \u2013 then you could say that it\u2019s not an addiction.\u201d But he\u2019s still encourage people to look at their relationship with all substances, he says. \u201cTo ask themselves, is this really what I want to be doing? Has it become too frequent? Is it just going out and partying, or is it masking a deeper psychological problem?\u201d *** There have been times when I\u2019ve scared myself. Physically, I\u2019m perhaps lucky in that I\u2019ve never come close to, or seen anyone overdose. The quality of the product is often iffy, particularly with cocaine, where the dealer will cut it and then offer a \u201cpremium\u201d, purer version for double the price tag. But it\u2019s the cravings that have made me uncomfortable; the feeling, after a few drinks, that a line would make everything infinitely better. And then, of course, there are the ethics. Cocaine has a particularly dire human cost. It comes to the UK via a long route \u2013 trafficked usually from Colombia, through Africa \u2013 and leaves in its wake a trail of human misery. But just as I push to the back of my mind the fact that a cheap flight to Lisbon is ruinous to the climate, so I bury my head to the idea that the product I\u2019m buying has taken a long, awful, circuitous route to get to me. Very few of the 20 or so people whom I canvassed for this article grew up knowing anything about substance abuse. They came from nice homes, dabbled at university and got into the rhythm of \u201cliving for the weekend\u201d when their post-recession careers didn\u2019t take off the way they expected. For now, I see this as a phase \u2013 one that will surely pass when we all have children and mortgages and real responsibilities to attend to. Though, as my friend Evie (29 and a product designer) points out, \u201cWhen do we really expect to become \u2018responsible\u2019? I\u2019ll be 30 in a few months\u2019 time, but I feel as if I\u2019ve lived in a state of extended adolescence. I don\u2019t expect ever to be able to buy my own house. I\u2019m single, so no kids to think about. I\u2019m not sure if \u2018we\u2019ll only do this while we\u2019re young and carefree\u2019 is a valid argument in the current climate.\u201d I can\u2019t deny Evie\u2019s logic. But this Friday night, sitting in a bar with a group of friends, with two whole days of freedom stretching ahead of me, I\u2019ll still probably end up saying to myself, \u201cOh well, might as well get it out of the way while I\u2019m still young,\u201d just as I did when I was 22. \u2022 Some names have been changed.",
