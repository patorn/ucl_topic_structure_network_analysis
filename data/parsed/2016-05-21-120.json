London,  Fire in the Mountain 3-5 June  The tiny folk and bluegrass event on a farm near Aberystwyth is run by a not-for-profit organisation with sustainability at its heart. With only 1,000-odd tickets, it is cherished for its intimacy, if not for the Welsh climate, which makes stout wellies and stouter blankets a must. Among this year\u2019s musical highlights are local boy the Gentle Good, Martha Tilston and the exuberant bluegrass of American old-time string band Foghorn Stringband. West Wales,  Songlines Encounters  2-4 June     Finnish folk trio V\u00e4rttin\u00e4 Photograph: Seppo Samuli/PR    The leading world music magazine programmes this annual event to showcase its pick of the best new acts from today\u2019s world music scene.

With a particularly strong tradition of family-friendliness, this is one to take your kids and your parents to; everyone will find something to keep them happy.

Malmesbury, Wiltshire,  Cambridge folk festival 28-31 July     Kate Rusby. Photograph: Matt Kent/Redferns    This long-established friendly festival showcases a wide variety of acts across several stages, and will be one of the best places to have a dance, with Afro Celt Sound System, Baaba Maal and the irrepressible Gogol Bordello among the headliners. Its folk credentials remain impeccable, with sets from some of today\u2019s most virtuosic musicians, including John McCusker, Sam Lee and Kate Rusby. Cambridgeshire, Sidmouth Folkweek 29 July-5 August Pretty much everyone who\u2019s anyone in British folk today puts in an appearance at this week-long annual festival on the Devon coast.

Devon,  Fairport\u2019s Cropredy Convention 11-13 August Established 35 years ago by folk royalty Fairport Convention, who open and close the proceedings, this festival might have strayed from its folk roots (Madness and the Bootleg Beatles are among the headliners), but it\u2019s still a place to catch some of the best of folk\u2019s future, as well as its past, with sets by Steeleye Span, Ralph McTell and BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award winner, the piper Brighde Chaimbeul.

Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    FolkEast 19-21 August At only five years old, FolkEast \u2013 in the 300-acre grounds of Glemham Hall \u2013 punches above its weight, with six stages (including one run entirely by solar power from a double-decker bus) and visits by many of folk\u2019s great and good, including Eliza Carthy and the Wayward Band, John Spiers, Belinda O\u2019Hooley and Heidi Tidow, and Rura. A new dedicated dance venue will host daily ceilidhs and workshops, and you\u2019ve only got a few weeks to place your bets as to which colour \u2013 or with what \u2013 the totemic tree (the dead oak in the middle of the Glemham Hall Estate) will be dressed this year.
