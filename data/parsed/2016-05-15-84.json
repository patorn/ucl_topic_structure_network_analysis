  "body": "Jazz Carlin believes there could be some unexpected performances by Britain\u2019s swimmers at the European Championships, which she describes as a first step on the team\u2019s Olympic journey. Carlin, who will compete in the 400m and 800m freestyle at the Aquatics Centre this week, qualified for the Rio Olympics at Britain\u2019s trials last month, having missed out on London 2012 following a bout of glandular fever. She is a key member of Britain\u2019s Games squad, of which there are high expectations after a disappointing medal haul four years ago.   Related: Adam Peaty spearheads 26-strong Great Britain swimming team for Rio 2016    A week of swimming events begins in London on Monday and Carlin, 25, says there is a buzz in the British squad as they step up their preparations for an Olympic summer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the full Olympic squad here and also the junior development team who are targeting Tokyo [2020], we\u2019ve got a real balance in the team and I think the Olympic squad is going to be great. It\u2019s a first step in our Olympic journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about looking forward to Rio now and it\u2019s important to race the best in Europe. I can\u2019t wait for the Olympics, I just want to enjoy racing this week, race well and race hard. It\u2019s tough to race the best in Europe, it\u2019s never easy, but I just want to get stuck in and relax. We\u2019ve definitely got that buzz and that excitement and it\u2019s starting to feel a lot more real. \u201cWe had our Olympic trials about four weeks ago and have been in that hard block of training, it\u2019s just about racing hard. Sometimes when you\u2019re racing the best in Europe you can surprise yourself. It\u2019s going to be a great crowd here supporting the British team.\u201d Carlin, who will be joined in the team by compatriots and fellow Olympic medal hopefuls Adam Peaty and James Guy, secured qualification for Rio in Glasgow last month with a 400m time of 4min\u00a04.33sec. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re a few months out from the Olympics so we want to see where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s not very often that you get a home championships, it\u2019s exciting to race a world-class field and I\u2019ve got great memories from Berlin two years ago. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to race and having that home crowd support is going to spur us on this week.\u201d",
