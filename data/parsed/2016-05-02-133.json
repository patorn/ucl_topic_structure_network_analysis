The editor of Cumhuriyet, one of the last remaining bastions of media opposition to Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had appeared in court that morning over a documentary he produced on government corruption. It is one of two cases against him \u2013 in February, he was released from prison pending a spying trial over a story on arms shipments to Syria. \u201cTurkey has never been a paradise for journalists but of course not a hell like this,\u201d he said in an interview in his office. \u201cNowadays being a journalist is much more dangerous than ever and needs courage and self-confidence.

Prosecutors have opened close to 2,000 cases of insults to the president since Erdo\u011fan took office in 2014, prominent journalists appear in court two or three times a week, Kurdish journalists are beaten or detained in the country\u2019s restive south-east and foreign journalists have been harassed or deported.           Turkish police storm a media firm in 2015. The Koza Ipek Holding firm was alleged to have links to government critics     Turkey ranks 151st among 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.   Press freedom graphic   D\u00fcndar was arrested in November with Cumhuriyet\u2019s Ankara bureau chief, Erdem G\u00fcl, charged with espionage and divulging state secrets and held in jail. The arms shipment story, published six months earlier, had alleged the Turkish intelligence service, M\u0130T, was sending weapons to rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria under the guise of humanitarian aid. Academics are also standing trial, accused of spreading propaganda by the separatist and outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). The result is a climate of fear and intimidation that Turkish journalists say is an attempt at silencing the critical press. \u201cShort of journalists being assassinated, we have every kind of problem,\u201d said \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6\u011fret, a freelance reporter and the representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists in the country. Some journalists have been killed. Kadri Ba\u011fdu, a journalist with a pro-Kurdish daily that had received numerous threats over its coverage, was killed by unidentified gunmen in October 2014. Syrian media activists and journalists have been killed in Turkey by Islamic State operatives. Erdo\u011fan remains as popular and powerful as ever \u2013 his Islamist AK party won an absolute majority in recent parliamentary elections, albeit in a deeply polarised country where a Kurdish insurgency rages in the south-east and Isis strikes in Ankara and Istanbul. \u201cThe only things that unite us in this country are cats and football,\u201d said \u00d6\u011fret. \u201c[But] if you kick a cat, you will be beaten up by a Kemalist, an Islamist or a socialist.\u201d Journalists and experts say the attacks on press freedom in Turkey are a sign of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s intolerance of criticism and a symptom of a broader power struggle between the president and supporters of his former ally Fethullah G\u00fclen, a preacher who now lives in exile in Pennsylvania. Erdo\u011fan believes G\u00fclenists in the judiciary and police constituted a \u201cparallel state\u201d that sought to overthrow him.     Fethullah G\u00fclen in Pennsylvania in March 2014. Photograph: Selahattin Sevi/AP    G\u00fclen\u2019s acolytes in the Turkish judiciary helped remove hundreds of members of thesecular military establishment, but then friends turned on each other. News of a major corruption investigation into Erdo\u011fan\u2019s inner circle emerged in 2013, supposedly leaked by the G\u00fclenists, creating a scandal that forced the resignations of government officials and furious accusations of an attempted coup. It may well have been. Even opponents of Erdo\u011fan say the G\u00fclenists may have thought they were powerful enough to topple the government. Or it may have been that all other rivals had been eliminated and the G\u00fclen-Erdo\u011fan alliance had run its course. Whatever the cause, G\u00fclen\u2019s group, Hizmet, quickly fell out of favour. Media companies linked to it were accused of funding and supporting terrorism, and government-appointed trustees took over the two main pro-G\u00fclen media conglomerates \u2013 Koza \u0130pek Holding and Feza, the parent company of Zaman newspaper. Zaman, once one of the largest circulation newspapers in Turkey, is now a resolutely pro-government title, its new executors unconcerned about keeping up a facade of impartiality. Most of the paper\u2019s well-known writers and editors have gone into exile. Those that remain struggle. Levent Kenez, a former Zaman journalist who is editor of the pro-G\u00fclen newspaper Meydan, said his newspaper\u2019s circulation dropped from 100,000 to about 40,000 after the distribution company was taken over by the government and decided to no longer circulate it.  Advertisers, which Kenez says are under pressure from the government, have also cut ties with the newspaper. \u201cI wake up every day thinking thank God they haven\u2019t yet taken over our newspaper, and every night it is thank God, we published today,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our psychology.\u201d     A man holds up a placard during a protest out the office of Zaman newspaper in Istanbul in March. Photograph: Emrah Gurel/AP    The state now controls most of the prominent media outlets in Turkey. \u201cErdo\u011fan wants to be a sultan, not just for Turkey but the whole region, so he wants to stop any kind of criticism,\u201d said D\u00fcndar. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a political struggle of course, to stop every critical point of view. It\u2019s not only in the press but TV, artists, academics. He hates criticism and this is the result of it, that Turkish prisons are full.\u201d Journalists with pro-government outlets deny an attack on press freedom. They acknowledge the aftermath of the takeovers was handled poorly and embarrassing to Turkey, but say journalists with links to the G\u00fclenist movement were not real journalists, rather puppets of a shadowy cult determined to overthrow the government. They insist the opposition press is vibrant, pointing to S\u00f6zc\u00fc, a widely read tabloid that mocks the president, and say anti-Erdo\u011fan columns form the majority of online commentary in the country. \u201cThe G\u00fclenists wanted to take over everything and organised conspiracies in order to reach their goal,\u201d said Ibrahim Altay, the ombudsman of the Daily Sabah, a pro-AK party newspaper. \u201cThey established a hidden government that members of the G\u00fclenist organisation were taking orders from. That\u2019s not acceptable under any circumstances. I want my secular state.\u201d Meryem Atlas, the paper\u2019s opinion editor, acknowledged that there was still much work to be done to make Turkey more democratic and transparent, but said the international press was exaggerating Turkey\u2019s problem and the media environment was a lot more free and critical than in the days of military rule, when all newspapers had to toe the junta\u2019s line. Opposition journalists in Turkey say the political battle with the G\u00fclenists has been used as a convenient club to shut down dissent among those with no links to them. D\u00fcndar, a staunch secularist, was initially accused of colluding with Hizmet in the arms shipment story for which he faces a life sentence if convicted. (An attempt to join D\u00fcndar\u2019s case to that of the broader alleged G\u00fclenist conspiracy was last month dismissed by a judge, but he still faces charges of espionage and divulging state secrets.) D\u00fcndar has pledged to continue the fight, though he has many more court appearances ahead. \u201cIf you\u2019re a journalist in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey, you have to be either a prisoner or a suspect or jobless,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the future there will be a Turkish exile press.\u201d Insulting the president     German chancellor Angela Merkel listens to Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan at a press conference in Berlin last month. Photograph: Axel Schmidt/AP    Turkey\u2019s justice minister said in March during a parliamentary session that his ministry had allowed 1,845 cases of insulting the president to be prosecution since he began his tenure in 2014. Under Turkish law, prosecutions for the offence can go ahead if permission is granted by the ministry. Critics say the proliferation of these cases is a sign of a broader crackdown on dissent.   Related: The Guardian view on the Jan B\u00f6hmermann affair: no joke    Article 299 of the penal code sets a prison term of more than four years if the insult is published in the press, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and those prosecuted include journalists, activists, academics and artists. \u201cSuch cases, even when they do not result in imprisonment, take a toll on journalists,\u201d the CPJ said. \u201cConstantly appearing in court and defending the right to report or express an opinion amounts to obstruction of professional activities.\u201d Last month Erdo\u011fan\u2019s lawyer even requested the prosecution in Germany of Jan B\u00f6hmermann, a German comedian who read out a poem alleged to have denigrated the Turkish president. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, accepted the request, saying it was up to the courts to decide the limits of freedom of expression.     Jan B\u00f6hmermann. Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images    \u201cFreedom of the press should never negate the respect for human dignity and freedom of the press can only survive and thrive with respect to human dignity,\u201d Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, said at a press briefing in Gaziantep last week. \u201cVery heavy insults against the president of a country that one should not really hear or read about, is that really part of the freedom of the press?\u201d Many journalists in Turkey have criticised the EU for failing to speak up about issues of freedom of expression. Brussels has been accused of even going so far as to delay and water down an annual report on human rights in Turkey so as not to jeopardise Ankara-Brussels talks about relocating refugees and migrants. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s supporters point to a rise in rightwing politics and Islamophobia in Europe as evidence of Europe\u2019s hypocrisy when it comes to freedom of speech issues in Turkey.",
