  "body": "The semantic struggle is real. Every day it gets harder and harder to know whether my vocabulary is inadvertently perpetuating a \u201cgrowing tyranny of feelings\u201d that threatens the very foundations of democracy. Thankfully the internet is full of vocabulary vigilantes eager to spell things out for the rest of the us \u2013 the most recent example being Molly Worthen, who recently published an op-ed in the New York Times urging people to \u201cStop Saying \u2018I Feel Like\u2019\u201d. According to Worthen, the phrase is \u201clinguistic hedging\u201d that evades the civilized conflict on which democracy is premised.  In case you\u2019re wondering why Worthen is qualified to tell people what not to say, she is an assistant professor of history who focuses on conservative Christianity. Her latest book was called Apostles of Reason: The Crisis of Authority in American Evangelicalism. I feel like this is an unusual way to become an apostle of linguistic reason, but I\u2019m no expert.  While Worthen explains that \u201cI feel like\u201d is used and abused across generations and genders, she also makes it clear that the trouble all started with young women. And her piece is just the latest example in a long history of unsolicited advice about what women should and should not say. In just the past couple years, there have been millions of words written explaining why \u201cundermining\u201d words or phrases like \u201csorry\u201d, \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not an expert\u201d are basically upholding the patriarchy while making you sound like a moron. There\u2019s even an app, Just Not Sorry, which helps you remove these words from emails.  Sorry, but this is all getting out of hand. I don\u2019t want to read any more op-eds about what women should or should not say. Let\u2019s just make things easier for everyone by laying down some ground rules that put a stop to the confusion: a Dictionary of WomanSpeak (get 10% off with your Woman Card) that serves as a definitive guide to things you should not say while being female.  \u2018I feel like\u2019 We\u2019ve already covered this, but I\u2019ll just repeat it for clarity: every time you say \u201cI feel like\u201d, a small part of democracy dies. So please, reach for more definitive, muscular phrase such as:  \u2022 \u201cI have a graph that demonstrates\u201d  \u2022 \u201cStatistics suggest\u201d \u2022 \u201cA man told me\u201d \u2022 \u201cA wise man told me\u201d (although this is obviously tautology) Rather than saying \u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to rain\u201d, for example, say: \u201cA man told me that it is going to rain.\u201d Democracy saved. \u2018I\u2019m no expert\u2019 Tara Mohr, a leadership coach, has advised women not to use qualifiers such as \u201cI\u2019m no expert in this, but \u2026\u201d She delivered this advice on a blogpost for Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle community. You should absolutely ban \u201cI\u2019m no expert\u201d from your vocabulary and replace it with \u201cYou\u2019ll find that the expert, Ramlikizan, once said ...\u201d Ramlikizan is a made-up name but people will be too embarrassed by not knowing it to contradict you.  \u2018I think\u2019 \u201cI think therefore I am undermining myself,\u201d said Descartes\u2019 sister. Well, that may not be exactly true, however the Just Not Sorry app highlights mentions of \u201cI think\u201d suggesting that they undermine your message. The solution to this is following the lead of Jane Austen and prefacing every opinion with \u201cIt is a truth universally acknowledged \u2026\u201d After all, would Pride and Prejudice have had quite the same appeal if it had started with \u201cI think \u2026\u201d? I think not. \u2018Just\u2019 Former Google exec Ellen Leanse has said women should stop using \u201cjust\u201d as a \u201cpermission\u201d word because it puts the person they are talking to into a \u201cparent\u201d position, granting them more authority and control. Bad uses of the word included: \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m just following up on \u2026\u201d \u2022 \u201cI was just wondering if you\u2019d decided ...\u201d Apparently, every time you use these phrases all the person is hearing is: \u201cPlease Mom, can I ...\u201d So take a time-out, ladies, and just don\u2019t do it. \u2018Bossy\u2019 Sheryl Sandberg is leading a charge to ban the word bossy, stating: \u201cWhen a little boy asserts himself, he\u2019s called a \u2018leader\u2019. Yet when a little girl does the same, she risks being branded \u2018bossy\u2019.\u201d However the best thing to do whenever a child speaks up is to not call them anything at all. Just ignore them.  \u2018Sorry\u2019 Sometimes you make mistakes maybe once or twice \u2013 and by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple hundred times \u2013 and you wonder: is it too late to say sorry now? The answer is yes. Never use the word \u201csorry\u201d in any context whatsoever or you will be letting all women down. It has been extensively documented that women apologize a lot and should stop. Tami Reiss, the creator of the Just Not Sorry app, says she is a big believer in saying thank you instead of sorry. So next time you spill coffee on your boss, just say thank you. You\u2019re welcome.",
