  "body": "The reservations Michael O\u2019Neill harboured about taking the Northern Ireland job have proved the most rewarding part for him. In three weeks\u2019 time the 46-year-old leads his country into its first European Championship finals on the back of a record unbeaten run, yet satisfaction at changing Northern Ireland\u2019s football history does not stem from results alone. \u201cIt is massive how much this means to the country,\u201d O\u2019Neill says, though not of the ticket to France and Group\u00a0C fixtures against Poland, Ukraine and the world champions Germany. The issue is much closer to home, one he referenced throughout Northern Ireland\u2019s remarkable rise to top their qualifying group and when collecting the BBC Sports Personality coach of the year award for 2015. It is the conviction Northern Ireland can have a football team that unites rather than divides. A recent survey of 1,000 people representing all communities in Northern Ireland, commissioned by the Irish Football Association, found 71% believed the entire country will be behind O\u2019Neill\u2019s team in France. \u201cIt is a phenomenal statistic,\u201d says Oonagh O\u2019Reilly, director of sales and marketing for the IFA and a former Gaelic footballer. \u201cNo other sport can do that in Northern Ireland.\u201d And it is where O\u2019Neill sees a marked difference with Northern Ireland\u2019s last appearances on the international stage, the World Cups of 1982 and 1986 under Billy Bingham. \u201cFootball was divisive in the past. The national team was divisive. The era I played in was divisive,\u201d says O\u2019Neill, who gathers his squad in the Republic of Ireland on Monday for their first pre\u2011Euro\u00a02016 training camp before returning to Belfast for the friendly against Belarus on Friday. \u201cI played during some of the worst moments of the Troubles. I remember playing in games at Windsor Park off the back of atrocities and the atmosphere was far from great. The atmosphere now in the stadium has a real strong Northern Ireland identity, whereas once you had to be one or the other. That has changed dramatically. The IFA have done an awful lot of work on that. \u201cWhen you have the success we have had you get to a situation where everyone who goes to the game now wears a Northern Ireland shirt. In the past they would be wearing a Rangers or Linfield shirt. That\u2019s been the biggest positive in terms of what it means to Northern Ireland. But this is a different era as well. Northern Ireland is a totally different place from what it was in \u201982 and \u201986. There\u2019s a whole generation of people who feel a stronger identity towards being Northern Irish.\u201d That is some responsibility on a man employed to win football matches for Northern Ireland, not elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. \u201cI\u2019m getting the Syria job next!\u201d O\u2019Neill responds, though it is not a responsibility he takes lightly. It was only 14 years ago that the team\u2019s Catholic captain, Neil Lennon, was forced to retire from international football after receiving sectarian abuse and a death threat. He adds: \u201cA big thing was made when I took the job because I was a Catholic and they hadn\u2019t had a Catholic manager for so long, certainly not Northern Ireland-born. The media made a lot of that at home. I was conscious of that. At times you sit back and you are concerned about that. I thought: \u2018This is a big thing, the consequences are potentially quite big\u2019 but the reaction of the people, the crowd, everyone inside and outside of the stadium has been so, so positive. More than anything that has probably been the most pleasing aspect of the whole thing.\u201d The challenge confronting O\u2019Neill is now confined to the football fields of Nice, Lyon and Paris, where almost 30,000 Northern Ireland fans will be in attendance after Uefa bowed to pressure and gave the IFA an extra 4,000 tickets. The manager, who selects from one of the smallest playing pools in Europe, travelled round France following qualification to choose a training camp. There are no massed ranks of highly paid support staff around the Northern Ireland manager and budget was a factor in selecting a base just north of Lyon, as it is when arranging international friendlies. Hence Belarus. Still it beats hitching a lift with a bus-load of Germany fans to watch Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s team play in Ukraine, as O\u2019Neill did at the last European Championship. \u201cMy previous jobs were at Brechin City, while I was trying to carve a career in financial services as well, and then I took the job at Shamrock Rovers because our financial services company went bust, which shows how good I was at that,\u201d says the former Newcastle United, Dundee United, Hibernian and Wigan Athletic midfielder. \u201cTaking Shamrock Rovers to the Europa League group stages gave me a lot of experience in preparing players who shouldn\u2019t have been playing at that level, and being able to handle it at that level. I\u2019ve carried that on, I\u2019ve tweaked and developed it, and this is a great opportunity for me as a coach. I\u2019ve told the players the one thing I can guarantee them is that our preparation will be as good as we can have it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to send people to do things so I go and do them. As a manager I don\u2019t leave a lot of things to chance. We are faced with problems all the time. The Chris Brunt situation [the West Bromwich Albion defender, one of only five Premier League regulars in the squad, ruptured a cruciate ligament in February]. Of all the players we could have lost that was the one position where we were weakest. We could have coped even with a centre-back because we have another one but with that situation, that\u2019s my problem to try and solve between now and the first game. That will be a test.\u201d O\u2019Neill is determined his players enjoy every second of \u201cthe biggest moment of their careers\u201d. He says: \u201cThat will excite them, it will motivate them and it will almost invigorate them to take this opportunity.\u201d The manager has been able to use plush training facilities at Arsenal and Manchester City to motivate his players, several of whom are accustomed to more basic surroundings in England\u2019s lower leagues or in Scotland. There will be no extra motivation needed when Northern Ireland kick off their first European Championship game against Poland on 12 June. \u201cOnly eight teams go home after the first phase. The message to the players is let\u2019s try not to be one of those,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cThe reaction of the players has been funny. The first time we saw them after the draw was in March and they genuinely believe \u2018we\u2019ve got a chance\u2019. In Romania, Hungary [two of the teams Northern Ireland finished above in qualifying] is there a big difference as opposed to Ukraine and Poland? \u201cWhat we maybe didn\u2019t have in our group were countries with that one special player. Romania and Hungary were quite similar to us, their strength was their team. But [Poland\u2019s Robert]Lewandowski, the two Ukrainian wingers [Yevhen Konoplyanka and Andriy Yarmolenko]. That will be our biggest challenge, how we stifle that level of player. \u201cThe key is not to be beaten in the first game. I\u2019m not expecting to be in the tournament on 10 July but, equally, I\u2019m also hoping I\u2019m not going home on 23 June either. We are the type of country no one wants to play. The expectation of Ukraine and Poland is that they should beat us, a tiny country. I was interviewed by Polish media back in Belfast and one guy was almost insulting, saying: \u2018But you\u2019ve got players from Fleetwood?\u2019 I said we have but we won our group. These are things which won\u2019t be underestimated by the opposition. We have to turn that into our favour.\u201d",
