  "body": "Melissa McCarthy has responded to criticism of the Ghostbusters reboot, saying she finds the original trailer \u201cvery confusing\u201d.   Related: Ghostbusters trailer is most disliked in YouTube history    The past week saw the trailer for the all-female take on the sci-fi comedy become the most disliked trailer on YouTube with over 600,000 thumbs down votes. McCarthy, who stars in the film alongside Kristen Wiig, has now spoken about her concerns over the way the trailer presents the story. \u201cIt\u2019s a reboot not a remake,\u201d she said on The John, Jay & Rich Show. \u201cI know its weird that they say [in the trailer] \u201830 years ago\u2019, but in this movie its like the first one didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s a great story but it\u2019s told totally differently. It\u2019s four unlikely heroes, it\u2019s in New York City, ghosts are taking over; it\u2019s that same classic story but it\u2019s not 30 years later ... it\u2019s not dependent on the first one.\u201d McCarthy also said that she raised the issue but was ignored. \u201cBelieve me the question was asked,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s very confusing. But then everyone said we don\u2019t care what you think.\u201d            Last week, director Paul Feig spoke to the Guardian about the negative response to the trailer, which many believe is down to the decision to change the gender of the leads. \u201cThe haters on our trailer were very proud of the fact they had racked up 400,000 [currently 648,000] dislikes on YouTube versus 200,000 likes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut [given the number of views] that\u2019s not a majority by anybody standards. Some of it is that people don\u2019t want an old property touched \u2013 I\u2019m sympathetic to that. But the ones who are hating it because it\u2019s about women? That\u2019s just a non-starter.\u201d",
