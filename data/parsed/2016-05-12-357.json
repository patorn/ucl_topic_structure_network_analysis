  "body": "Piers Morgan has heard that Erin does a good Amazing Grace, that it\u2019s her go-to song. Is that true? \u201cIt might be,\u201d giggles Erin, 24, shyly. \u201cDo you still sing it? asks Morgan. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d \u201cCould you sing it now?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d And she does. Nicely. \u201cWow,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cYou have a great voice.\u201d Sounds like a big fat yes from Morgan, then. Ant and Dec give Erin a cheeky Geordie thumbs up from the wings \u2026 Well, they probably would, if this was Britain\u2019s Got Talent. But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not even America\u2019s Got Talent. More like Hilltop Unit Texas State Prison\u2019s Got Talent. Yes, Morgan is in jail. Yay, at last, you say? But it\u2019s just for an hour I\u2019m afraid, to interview Erin Caffey, the first of the Killer Women With Piers Morgan (ITV). Eight years ago, when she was 16, Erin masterminded the murder of her mother and her two brothers. Her dad survived the attack, which was carried out by Erin\u2019s boyfriend Charlie, 18, and his friend Charles while Erin and another pal, Bobbi, waited in the car. It\u2019s one thing for a teenager to say she wishes her parents are dead, it\u2019s another to go away and calmly organise it. An extraordinary, gruesome story, the more so because the Caffeys were a nice, close family who went to church. That\u2019s the angle that seems to interest Morgan most \u2013 the fun-loving girl with the voice of an angel but the soul of the devil who killed her family. As she sings Amazing Grace we hear her therapist saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never come across anyone as dangerous as Erin, and I hope I never do.\u201d Morgan is a good interviewer. (And doesn\u2019t he know it. It\u2019s almost performance interviewing: look at me, tough guy asking the tough questions, but with a human understanding too.) Erin doesn\u2019t give an awful lot away though. Her dad, who he also speaks to, is more forthcoming and more interesting, about how he came to forgive his daughter; she is all he has got now, even if she is the reason she\u2019s all he has got now. Otherwise there\u2019s something a bit murder-porn about it all, the story of the pretty little blond girl who got the boyfriend her family disapproved of to slaughter them. Then they went back to his trailer and had sex (Morgan asks her about this, of course.) It\u2019s not an immersive new investigation into a case. There seems to be no question of miscarriage of justice \u2013 Making a Murderer this really isn\u2019t. There are no great revelations, or insights into violence and gender, no special reason for it at all, except that Erin is a KILLER WOMAN and she\u2019s with PIERS MORGAN. Get in! Ant\u2019n\u2019Dec get a mention in Cunk on Shakespeare (BBC2), as it happens. \u201cPopular entertainment in Shakespeare\u2019s day was often unpleasant, involving public humiliation and mindless cruelty to animals, with no Ant\u2019n\u2019Dec to take the edge off it all,\u201d says Philomena Cunk, the idiot reporter sired by Charlie Brooker and so exquisitely given birth to by Diane Morgan. (I\u2019m sure it requires pushing and pain but it looks so easy and natural, as if she just plopped out like a slippery seal pup.) Cunk has been studying Shakespeare \u201cever since I was asked to do this programme, and it turns out he was more than just a bald man who could write with feathers\u201d. You can hear CB\u2019s own feather behind every line. In the arsiness \u2013 literally, with Philomena tittering at the anus in Coriolanus and a newly discovered play called Tight Arse And Droniclus; in the imaginativeness and the references to the new \u2013 Philomena\u2019s realisation that Shakespeare invented computer games, and that by far his greatest work (arguably his only good one) is Game of Thrones; in the odd shrewd truth too: \u201cOf course, if you go to watch a Shakespeare comedy today, you\u2019ll hear the audience laughing as though there are jokes in it, even though there definitely aren\u2019t.\u201d I hate those people, those laughers. There definitely are jokes in this, it\u2019s very funny. I also like that it\u2019s not so squirmingly Ali G-mean on the serious Shakespeare contributors \u2013 the archivist Paul Taylor, theatre director Iqbal Khan, actor Simon Russell Beale and Mr Burton, the \u201cfictional English teacher from TV drama Educating Yorkshire\u201d. I think they\u2019re having a good time too. Brilliant.",
