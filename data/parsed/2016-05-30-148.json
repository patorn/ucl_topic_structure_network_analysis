I think that has become clear in the reaction to Operation Black Vote\u2019s latest campaign poster, A Vote is a Vote, which was created by the advertising company Saatchi & Saatchi. In the 24 hours since it was released Operation Black Vote has been called everything under the sun, fielding gross abuse and implicit threats of violence. For the past 20 years Operation Black Vote has been dedicated to encouraging political and civic engagement by black and ethnic minorities and tackling all forms of racism. Our goal with this campaign is multifaceted. We want to encourage and inspire many more people from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds to register to vote and to engage in the EU referendum debate. We also want to challenge and counter the toxicity around issues such as immigration, which we feel has arisen on both sides of the debate. The arguments around the EU referendum are crucial and yet all the \u201cnudge nudge, wink wink\u201d and half-truths have taken the public down a path that leads ordinary, hard-working BME people to be abused. We decided to represent, on one side of a seesaw, an Asian woman \u2013 we purposely didn\u2019t distinguish her race or religion. On the other side we chose to picture not an ordinary white person \u2013 precisely because we didn\u2019t want to generalise white society \u2013 but a thuggish-looking character who might be abusive. We didn\u2019t give any indication on the poster of which way either figure would be voting, we just used the visuals to highlight that every vote is equal. Politicians, newspapers and individuals have made their own assumptions about who in this picture might vote leave and who might vote to remain. The debate about immigration has, in recent times, become rabid and those who choose to be abusive don\u2019t distinguish between the many different BME groups who bear the brunt of animosity around this issue.     Vote Leave\u2019s poster warning against immigration from Turkey.    Some of the responsibility for the tone of the debate \u2013 and the ensuing racism \u2013 must lie at the door of politicians and their parties. For example, last week Vote Leave launched a poster that suggested there was a possibility that 76 million Turkish citizens might come to the UK. This is factually impossible. But the effect of saying it creates fear and loathing, which for some translates into the abuse we\u2019ve captured in this picture. Another example of race entering the debate unnecessarily was Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion that President Barack Obama was anti-British because his father was Kenyan and had been ill-treated under British colonial rule. Is Johnson suggesting that all of us from the Commonwealth are potentially anti-British? I hope not. In recent years, too, some Labour party politicians and members have done their fair share of \u201cdog whistling\u201d around the immigration issue. Over these last few weeks the Operation Black Vote campaign has included a series of debates up and down the country with BME communities discussing the EU referendum. We were not surprised to find a great diversity of views, with many arguing we should stay and many arguing we should leave. What has become abundantly clear, however, from these debates, is that those who lean toward leave are being alienated by the divisive rhetoric of some leave campaigners. One attendee said they found it hard to be a supporter of leave after Nigel Farage stated that Labour wanted to \u201crub our noses in diversity\u201d. In a closely fought EU campaign the 4 million BME voters could be the deciding factor but many are being put off by the negativity of the debate at present. If by highlighting what is already an uncomfortable truth politicians on all sides will scale down the politics of fear and loathing, we\u2019ll all benefit. Operation Black Vote hasn\u2019t sought to be divisive but with so much rabid rhetoric \u2013 particularly around immigration \u2013 we wanted to say that sometimes this is how that noise translates, and it\u2019s really not good. Remona Aly: Yes, such playground politics puts people off voting      The EU referendum debate has predictably descended into a race-fuelled scrap \u2013 and last week that scrap turned nastier. The latest stumble into playground politics is a campaign poster launched by Operation Black Vote (OBV), which intends to rally voters from BME communities, and doesn\u2019t hold back on shock tactics. The image depicts a seesaw: at one end sits a white male skinhead, wagging an angry finger at a South Asian granny poised peacefully in her sari at the other end. She looks as if she\u2019d still ply him with a plate of samosas. This poster is in your face and powerful, but in essence I have a problem with it. There\u2019s an implication, intentional or not, that Brexit voters are all white fascists ready to taunt the old auntie next door. By wheeling out drastic stereotypes, this limits what should be a broader and healthier debate around the referendum. Instead, it dives head-first into an already very loaded and messy argument. Simon Woolley, director of OBV, insists the campaign poster is a mirror, reflecting \u201cthe toxicity of the present, rabid immigration debate\u201d. Well, it certainly has been toxic. Not only has Boris Johnson alluded to Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d heritage as a reason for his \u201cancestral dislike for the British Empire\u201d, but a poster from Vote Leave also depicted the footprints of Turkish migrants queuing to get into Britain, should it remain a part of the EU. Stereotypes are clearly in play, but should OBV really stoop to the same level? Their poster has been called racist, distasteful and even provoked a hissy fit from Nigel Farage, who said it was \u201ctrying to divide society\u201d. As you can imagine, this led to incredulous responses from some \u2013 as one tweeter jibed, \u201cpot, kettle, black\u201d. I feel like we\u2019re getting dragged further into the desperate times we\u2019re living in. Instead of rising above the dirty politics, we are led straight in by the nose. Fear-mongering is being used as a tool to push people to vote. It\u2019s true that BME voters could tip the Brexit balance. There are an estimated 4 million in the UK alone, plus an additional 400,000 from the British Commonwealth who are eligible to vote in the EU referendum \u2013 although around 30% are not even registered. And of those who are, some are still apathetic. It\u2019s not hard to understand why. Speaking as one of the 4 million minority effnik voters in Britain, I\u2019ll raise a pint of Shloer to toast the day we stop parading fear, panic and polarised cliches just to score points in the political arena. We are all part of the debate. Let\u2019s make it a healthier one.",
