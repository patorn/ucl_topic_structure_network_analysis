  "body": "Film-maker Ken Loach has called the benefits system a \u201ccruel bureaucracy\u201d that makes users feel inferior and desperate in an interview after winning his second Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes film festival.   Related: Peter Bradshaw on Cannes's closing awards: baffling choices don't spoil a vintage year    Loach clinched the festival\u2019s highest honour for his welfare state drama I, Daniel Blake, about a carpenter struggling with the inanities and indignities of the benefits system.  Loach, who will turn 80 next month, came out of retirement to make the movie, saying he hoped it would influence welfare policy in the same way one of his very first films, Cathy Come Home, had changed political thinking on homelessness. \u201cI think we have to look again at this whole cruel sanctions and benefit system, which is out to tell the poor that it\u2019s their own fault and if they don\u2019t have a job it\u2019s because they are incompetent or useless,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday.  \u201cThere\u2019s a despair and anger with people who are facing this and those trying to support them. The fact that we now accept food banks as part of our national scene, this is actually unacceptable.\u201d When asked by presenter Sarah Montague why he thought there was such a groundswell of public support for welfare measures such as the benefits cap, Loach said that was an opinion of \u201cpeople who listen to the Today programme too much\u201d. \u201cIf you actually get out amongst the food banks and the people supporting people there, people who would not eat unless if it weren\u2019t for the charity, who have to choose between heating and food, I think you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a great disgust and despair about that in this country now,\u201d he said.    Related: Cannes 2016: Ken Loach wins Palme d'Or \u2013 the Dailies film podcast    Despite being a realist drama about the British welfare system, I, Daniel Blake was praised by the Cannes jury for its universally relatable story, with jury member Donald Sutherland calling it \u201can absolutely terrific movie that resonates in your heart and soul\u201d. \u201cI think dealing with a cruel bureaucracy is something that crosses borders and people understand the frustration of being constantly trapped by call centres, by people who won\u2019t give you the help you need and facing a bureaucracy that is out to deny you what you feel is your right, is something we all understand,\u201d Loach said. The recognition for the film, he said, was down to \u201cfinding a theme and a story that people can identify with and take something from and has some connection to the world that we\u2019re living in\u201d.",
