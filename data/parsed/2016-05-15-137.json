Singer-songwriter Jamala was crowned the winner for her haunting rendition of the ballad 1944, which evoked the deportation of Crimean Tatars by Josef Stalin and has been interpreted as a criticism of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. As she collected her trophy, she pleaded for \u201cpeace and love\u201d.  Before the final, which was held in Stockholm on Saturday evening and seen by many as the most politicised edition of the competition to date, Jamala had said her victory would show that Europeans were \u201cready to hear about the pain of other people\u201d.    Related: Ukraine's Eurovision singer urges voters to show Crimea solidarity    Jamala, whose real name is Susana Jamaladynova, is herself a Crimean Tatar who has not been home since shortly after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of the peninsula. Her parents and extended family still live there. \u201c[If I win,] it will mean that modern European people are not indifferent, and are ready to hear about the pain of other people and are ready to sympathise,\u201d Jamala told the Guardian by phone from the Swedish capital shortly before the contest. Referring to her song\u2019s lyrics, she said: \u201cOf course it\u2019s about 2014 as well. These two years have added so much sadness to my life. Imagine \u2013 you\u2019re a creative person, a singer, but you can\u2019t go home for two years. You see your grandfather on Skype, who is 90 years old and ill, but you can\u2019t visit him. What am I supposed to do: just sing nice songs and forget about it? Of course I can\u2019t do that.\u201d      Australia\u2019s Dami Im was leading the competition all the way until Ukraine pipped her to the post thanks to the public telephone vote. Photograph: IBL/Rex/Shutterstock    Accepting her Eurovision trophy, she said: \u201cI know that you sing a song about peace and love, but actually, I really want peace and love to everyone.\u201d She then thrust the glass microphone prize and yelled: \u201cThank you, Europe \u2013 welcome to Ukraine!\u201d  Guest nation Australia, represented by Dami Im\u2019s Sound of Silence, came second, with favourites Russia in third, Bulgaria in fourth and Sweden fifth. The UK\u2019s act, Joe and Jake, finished 24th out of the 26 entries, despite drawing a favourable reaction from the Stockholm crowd for their peformance of You\u2019re Not Alone.  Graham Norton, who guided UK viewers through the grand final on BBC One, led a toast to his predecessor, Sir Terry Wogan, during the ninth song, which this year was host country Sweden\u2019s entry, If I Were Sorry, performed by Frans. Norton took over the job in 2009 and was narrating his first Eurovision since Sir Terry died in January.  Justin Timberlake provided the half-time entertainment, opening his performance with his hit Rock Your Body before moving on to his new single, Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling.    Related: Eurovision song contest 2016 \u2013 in pictures    This year\u2019s competition used a new voting system, under which points were awarded partly by juries from member countries and partly by a public telephone vote. Australia had been in the lead at the end of the jury stage, but the phone voters ultimately swung things Ukraine\u2019s way.  The show was broadcast live in Europe, China, Kazakhstan, Australia, New Zealand and, for the first time, the United States. The viewing figures for this year\u2019s contest are not yet known, but they are expected to exceed the 200 million who tuned in last year.",
