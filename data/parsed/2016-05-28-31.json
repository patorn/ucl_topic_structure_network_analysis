  "body": "Marcus Rashford\u2019s amalgam of fearlessness, imperious finishing and fast decision making has left Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson searching for superlatives.   Related: England\u2019s Roy Hodgson: making tough choices for Euro 2016 is part of job    It was a little after 10pm on Friday when a member of the Football Association\u2019s security detail escorted the 18-year-old Manchester United striker along the short walk between the Stadium of Light\u2019s main entrance and England\u2019s team bus. After scoring on his senior international debut and almost certainly booking his place in Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad for France for the European Championship, Rashford had become a protected species. Sudden fame can do strange things to teenagers but, following the 2-1 win against Australia at Sunderland, Sterling and Henderson are confident Rashford will comfortably take it in his rangy, coltish stride. \u201cHe plays with no fear,\u201d said Henderson, who hopes to have proved his fitness to Hodgson by midnight on Tuesday when England\u2019s coach must trim his squad to the final, Chantilly-bound 23. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll continue to do that. Playing with no fear and just enjoying your football like Marcus can be a real positive. We\u2019ve got a lot of young players in the squad and their lack of fear can be a good thing.\u201d If Rashford\u2019s right-foot volley in the third minute was the highlight of a balmy Wearside evening, his all-round game generally proved impressive. \u201cA brilliant debut,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure on Marcus so I was delighted. He has to keep doing that, keep improving but I\u2019m sure he will. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good all-round player. He\u2019s got everything in his locker and he\u2019s only 18. He looks very mature so, yeah, I think he\u2019d be ready to go to France. Australia was a big test and he passed it. There\u2019s a lot of good strikers in the squad, so anyone could be in the 23, but Marcus has given himself the best opportunity.\u201d Hodgson was particularly excited by much of the link play between Rashford and Sterling with the United striker seeming to bring the best out in the Manchester City creator. \u201cI\u2019m really impressed with Marcus,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cHe makes his decisions early and he\u2019s a quality finisher. I\u2019m looking forward to playing and working with him over the years ahead. \u201cIn the changing room beforehand I said to Marcus: \u2018Straight away when I get on the ball, try to look in behind.\u2019 Then, when he got on the ball, I did the same. It was our first game together and our link-up play probably wasn\u2019t the best but there are signs it will improve.\u201d Hodgson was much more enthusiastic about the pair\u2019s embryonic chemistry after Rashford\u2019s promptings at times helped remind everyone precisely why there was such a fuss about Sterling\u2019s controversial switch from Liverpool to City. It helps that the latter clearly revels in playing for this England coach. \u201cIt\u2019s really a positive when the manager tells you every time you get the ball that he wants you to go forwards,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cI\u2019m most definitely enjoying my football. It\u2019s really good, that, in every England training session, if I don\u2019t go forward, the manager has a dig at me; that\u2019s something I\u2019m relishing. \u201cSomeone really pushing me to get forward and play is something I really enjoy. I\u2019ve worked with Roy over the last few years and he knows me well so hopefully I can really show him I\u2019ve got something that can have a positive impact on the tournament.\u201d   Related: Mamadou Sakho handed Euro 2016 lifeline after Uefa doping ban expires    It would be a major surprise were Sterling not to be in England\u2019s party and, once in France, he hopes to help translate optimism into reality. \u201cWe\u2019re going into the tournament to do well, not just to partake but to really try to challenge for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s being naive. We just need to listen to the manager and take heed because some of his tactics and formations have really worked for us.\u201d The all-important ability to listen to the right people but turn a deaf ear to the wrong ones is a quality Sterling believes he has acquired in recent months. \u201cI\u2019ve learned quite a bit since going into City for my first year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a massive learning curve. \u201cI haven\u2019t scored or assisted as many goals as I\u2019ve wanted to but I\u2019m definitely improving mentally. That\u2019s the most important thing. I\u2019ve learned to not really listen to outsiders and just concentrate on being myself and expressing myself. \u201cI think my main problem has been that sometimes I get drawn into staying out too wide but against Australia I got in behind and I could get closer to the box and create stuff.\u201d Newly recovered from a knee injury, Henderson seems to have made the equivalent of a late dash into the penalty area just in time for Euro 2016. The former Sunderland midfielder completed his first full 90 minutes since stepping off the treatment table and should feature in Hodgson\u2019s tournament plans. Even so he will be pleased when England\u2019s coach completes a painful cull. \u201cNo one\u2019s safe, really \u2013 maybe one or two,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cEveryone\u2019s fighting for a place and I\u2019m no different. I\u2019m sure Roy will pick his best 23 but we\u2019ve got a lot of good players in the squad so it could be any 23.\u201d With Fabian Delph ruled out, Roy Hodgson must drop two players from this provisional Euro 2016 squad on Tuesday: Goalkeepers: Joe Hart, Fraser Forster, Tom Heaton. Defenders: Gary Cahill, Chris Smalling, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Ryan Bertrand, Danny Rose, Nathaniel Clyne. Midfielders: Dele Alli, Ross Barkley, Eric Dier, Danny Drinkwater, Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana, James Milner, Raheem Sterling, Andros Townsend, Jack Wilshere; Strikers: Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Daniel Sturridge, Marcus Rashford. FRANCE OR FROZEN OUT? FOUR SWEATING ON A PLACE BEFORE TUESDAY\u2019S CUT DANIEL STURRIDGE Roy Hodgson is desperate to include the Liverpool forward and says he will take him but a calf injury dictates Sturridge has not trained since joining up with England and was forced to sit out the Australia friendly. If the doctors say he won\u2019t be ready for England\u2019s first game on 11 June, reluctantly, he will be left behind. DANNY DRINKWATER The return to fitness of both Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere (even though the legacy of his broken leg seems to be restricting his mobility) could well spell bad news for the Leicester City midfielder. Asked to perform in a left-sided role that is not his forte against Australia, Drinkwater failed to impress. ANDROS TOWNSEND A big part of his problem is that Hodgson\u2019s two preferred formations, the diamond and 4-3-3, are not best suited to an orthodox winger. His early-season first-team exile at Spurs may count against him but it could all hinge on which two from Townsend, Ross Barkley and Drinkwater England\u2019s coach culls. ROSS BARKLEY Barkley failed to impress as a substitute against Australia and ended the season in lacklustre form for Everton. But Hodgson is loyal to those who have performed well for him and that he played the full 90 minutes of England\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Holland at Wembley in March, having earlier made an impact late on as England spectacularly came from 2-0 down to beat Germany 3-2 in Berlin, will not be forgotten.",
