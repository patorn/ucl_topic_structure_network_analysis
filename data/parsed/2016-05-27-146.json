  "body": "The Guardian has partnered with Canon to launch a stunning new brand campaign using the latest suite of Guardian\u2019s digital ad formats in a deal brokered by PHD. Canon\u2019s latest \u2018travel camera\u2019 campaign kicks off today and harnesses the new ad units - \u2018Guardian Frame\u2019 and \u2018Guardian Focus\u2019. These formats will showcase the beautiful images the Canon camera captures across the Guardian\u2019s mobile and tablet platforms, helping to engage with its influential readers. The new formats expand the Guardian\u2019s native ad proposition, which can now be executed across the Guardian - offering an even deeper, richer and comprehensive ad experience. Designed and developed in-house, \u2018Frame\u2019 and \u2018Focus\u2019 offer a new level of contextual sensitivity, engagement mechanisms and high-quality visual impact. Canon will incorporate these new formats into a Guardian-wide campaign, including a unique brand experience in the Guardian app, providing Canon with an opportunity to deepen their relationship with the Guardian\u2019s most engaged audience. The campaign will kick off with a front page takeover, and the ads will then be featured across the Guardian\u2019s network front, travel, lifestyle, tech and culture verticals. Susie Donaldson, Marketing Director, Canon UK said: \u201cThe Guardian\u2019s new formats are great for showcasing the incredible images Canon cameras can capture. It\u2019s fantastic to be able to reach the Guardian\u2019s influential audiences in such compelling, beautiful and impactful ways.\u201d The new formats are: Guardian Frame: A native ad unit designed to sit sensitively within the flow of Guardian content, wholly sympathetic to its surroundings. The format mirrors the Guardian\u2019s core visual style.  Frame is designed to be fully responsive, rendering effortlessly across all devices and includes the new \u2018Guardian lozenge\u2019 - an interactive call-to-action corner icon. This is available on all Guardian\u2019s digital platforms. Guardian Focus: An immersive mobile display experience that hosts an interactive sliding gallery and is optimised for beautiful image-led campaigns on mobile devices (app and web). These are in addition to an expansion of Guardian Fabric - a responsive full width-banner which can now be deployed anywhere across the site and platforms. Nick Hewat, commercial director, Guardian News & Media said: \u201cThese new formats are as beautiful as they are impactful - designed to showcase advertising at its best. We\u2019ve been researching and working with developers, our readers and advertisers to create new formats that have affinity with the device and context of the editorial environment, as well as encouraging deeper reader engagement. I\u2019m delighted to be bringing these to market and raise the bar for native ad display campaigns.\u201d -Ends- For more information please contact:  media.enquiries@theguardian.com or 020 335 32219 Notes to Editors  About Guardian News & Media Guardian News & Media (GNM) publishes theguardian.com, one of the world\u2019s leading English-language newspaper websites.
