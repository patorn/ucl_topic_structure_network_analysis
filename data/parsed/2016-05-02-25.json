Leicester!\u201d The supporters of Chelsea soon allowed that chant to segue into another one, a spine-tingling one: \u201cChampions! Champions!\u201d A touch of the surreal enveloped Stamford Bridge as the greatest story football might have etched reached its wondrous completion after a tumultuous occasion on which a record nine Tottenham players were booked.   Related: Leicester City win the Premier League title after fairytale season    How extraordinary that Claudio Ranieri, once of this parish, a man who was removed from the Chelsea job during Roman Abramovich\u2019s first year of ownership, perhaps because of the reputation that he was not combative enough to win major honours, should experience the finest moment of his career thanks to events at Stamford Bridge. Mamma Mia. Even Claudio\u2019s 96-year-old mother, with whom he shared lunch on this astonishing day, could not have seen many tales quite like this. Leicester City are Premier League champions. They were helped over the line by the deposed title-holders as Chelsea showed the kind of defiant streak they seldom mustered this season to pierce a briefly buoyant Tottenham. Leicester\u2019s closest challengers, 2-0 up at half-time, brimmed with intent to fight to the last. But Chelsea\u2019s second-half riposte cut them down. The equalising goal, a superb arrowing strike from Eden Hazard, brought a theatrical end to it all. Guus Hiddink fielded a phone call from Ranieri shortly after the final whistle to hear heartfelt thanks. The Italian\u2019s voice was trembling. As climaxes go, this was of the purest nerve-shredding, tension-fuelled variety. It was also malevolent \u2013 as brutal physically as it was emotionally. Chelsea\u2019s role as kingmakers during this title finale provoked them into some spark and spite. That was the dominant tone for a feisty encounter that was on the limit of control from the moment the ball began rolling. At times provocation and reactions crashed over the line of acceptability and when the dust settles both teams may well face consequences. As Tottenham\u2019s fading league hopes evaporated their discipline lapsed completely. Twice Mauricio Pochettino, who spent most of the evening pacing his technical area like a coiled spring, raced on to the pitch to deal with altercations. At the end of the game chaos engulfed the route into the tunnel and Hiddink ended up sprawling. The Dutchman took it in good spirits. His Argentinian counterpart did his utmost to explain it all away as one of those things under the circumstances. \u201cThis is the end of the season, the emotion, we are human,\u201d he said. Hiddink, who played the role of peacemaker frequently, had some sympathy. \u201cThere was a lot at stake for them and for us prestige was at stake. It was an emotional game between two big clubs. I had to come in between a lot of people.\u201d           Mauricio Pochettino: Spurs must now fight to keep second place.    The worst of the episodes involved Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who gouged at Diego Costa\u2019s eyes during a wider m\u00eal\u00e9e sparked by a confrontation between Danny Rose and Willian. Retrospective punishment is likely to be on the agenda. Cesc F\u00e0bregas accused \u00c9rik Lamela of stamping on his hand. Some of the tackles were more suited to rugby by the end. Frankly it was almost impossible for Mark Clattenburg to keep up, and there were 12 yellow cards (it could have easily been worse). Frantic is something of an understatement. The hostilities were helterskelter, with a screeching tempo in front of a salty atmosphere. Somewhere amid this ferocity Tottenham\u2019s mission was to find composure. The game\u2019s pendulum swung in the 33rd minute as they broke to seize the lead. The move was based on slick build-up play on the edge of the box as the ball was pinged from Christian Eriksen to Lamela, who prodded forwards to Harry Kane. Tottenham\u2019s top scorer, who found time in possession hard to come by during this breathless wrestle, was suddenly handed one of those moments where the clock almost slowed. Played onside by John Terry, Kane enjoyed a moment of clarity. He sidestepped Asmir Begovic and planted the ball in the net. The England striker was elated to claim his 14th goal in his last 15 games. The Tottenham celebrations increased shortly before half-time when they doubled their lead. Kane won the ball in midfield and there was Eriksen, who orchestrated beautifully once again. His subtle pass, shifting play forwards and into Son Heung-min\u2019s path, unlocked the door for the South Korean to finish crisply. Chelsea did not appear to have the quality to match from a technical point of view, and at half-time Hiddink introduced Hazard for the largely ineffective Pedro. The home team found refreshed verve. Just before the hour mark they found a method to finally make a footballing impact. Willian\u2019s floated corner fell for Gary Cahill, who escaped Toby Alderweireld to unleash some of Chelsea\u2019s frustration bylashing the ball past Hugo Lloris.

A minute later Costa raced goalwards only to tumble before he could shape to shoot. Chelsea sensed an opportunity to sting their old foes. Willian was the next with a chance but Lloris saved capably. Chelsea threatened again when a ball flashed across the face of goal and Walker just managed to clear as Costa lurked for a tap-in. Then came Hazard\u2019s blistering coup de grace. \u201cAfter the whole season and the dream to be champion it is difficult to take off this feeling,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cOur players are disappointed and sad we need to feel that for the future.\u201d On Sunday 15 May the visitors here at Stamford Bridge will be Leicester. Claudio Ranieri. The champions.",
