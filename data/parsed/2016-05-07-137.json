  "body": "If you set a fantasy tale in the real world, do your characters read fantasy? Are they aware of the conventions of the genre \u2013 conventions you might want to\u00a0use yourself? One tactic is the\u00a0kind of knowingness seen in\u00a0the work\u00a0of Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and\u00a0director of Avengers films, whose characters joke about the narrative tropes they enact. The key is to mix banter with action in\u00a0a way that makes the narrative feel fresh without undermining its emotional power. Eoin Colfer with his Artemis Fowl series and Rick Riordan in his Percy Jackson books have proved themselves masters of this mix in children\u2019s fiction, and Dave Rudden\u2019s debut has been compared to\u00a0both. Rudden sets out his\u00a0stall in a\u00a0prologue in which an unpleasant orphanage director contemplates the dangers of having a\u00a0library and letting children read \u201cstory after story of noble orphans rescued from drudgery \u2013 and now every time someone came to visit, hopeful orphans began packing their bags, ready for their new life as wizard, warrior or prophesied king\u201d. This is, of course, exactly the story Rudden himself is telling: about an orphan who turns out to have extraordinary magical powers. His name is Denizen Hardwick, and he has grown up in an orphanage reading fantasy books. One day, he is summoned to meet a\u00a0mysterious aunt he never knew he had, and is drawn into a fantastical underworld in which his aunt leads a\u00a0secret organisation dedicated to fighting magical creatures of darkness. \u201cThis is the worst recruiting pitch ever,\u201d Denizen observes, as his gruff aunt spells out the perils of joining the organisation. Sometimes the dialogue is a little hard to believe, especially coming from a child, but mostly Rudden gets the balance right. And his prose is\u00a0spot on, with well-worked, striking images that feel newly forged and full of attitude. The fighting, for example, is done with incantations made of light: an\u00a0arresting concept that is at once visceral and cerebral. Power bursts outof Denizen in a satisfyingly tactile way, yet it also has a shimmering poetry that makes it properly magical. The characters themselves would never call it that, though, dismissing the word \u2018magic\u2019 and the conventions of fairytales even as they live them. . And although Denizen\u2019s power comes a\u00a0little easily to him, Rudden is very good on the cost of magic. There is a\u00a0literal cost in which parts of\u00a0the body turn to iron, starting with the hands. And while there is a satisfying explanation for why this cost involves iron, Rudden resists the temptation to\u00a0over-explain, keeping even his\u00a0most knowledgable characters largely in the dark and retaining the magic\u2019s mystery. There are complex characters of both sexes here. Most memorable is Denizen\u2019s aunt, a fearsome warrior and\u00a0commander, characterised in terms of the iron hammer she carries \u2013 \u201cthe softest thing about her\u201d. She also carries a great secret that is closely guarded until the end, making for a\u00a0twist that has real emotional power, as well as being beautifully set up and executed. This, more than anything, shows why Rudden is an author to watch. Knights of the Borrowed Dark is\u00a0a pacy, entertaining read, but it has a\u00a0heart, too. \u2022 To order Knights of the Borrowed Dark for \u00a35.59 (RRP \u00a36.99) go\u00a0to\u00a0bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.",
