At 8:18am local time in New Zealand, Hayley Stirling received a text saying Chelsea had just scored a goal and were now 2-1 down against Spurs. They needed to equalise for Leicester to win the Premier League.

Come on!!\u201d Several minutes later, the text she wanted landed. \u201cOh my god!!!!!!!! Waaaaahhhhhoooooooo!!!! Foxes foxes foxes foxes!!!! Ranieri for president!\u201d she replied. Stirling lives in Dunedin, the nearest city in New Zealand to the exact opposite point from Leicester if you drilled a tunnel right through the globe \u201cI think it\u2019s a timeless thing anyone can relate too - we all want the underdog to have a chance for success, in sport and life,\u201d said Stirling, who is the Women\u2019s Football Development Officer for Football South.  As daylight moves west, the world has woken up to a miracle in the British Midlands, gradually celebrated across the Earth by millions who love English football. Or indeed any football. In Japan, the official broadcaster NHK singled out its national, Shinji Okazaki for praise: \u201cHe worked tirelessly in front of the goal, and was devoted to protecting his defence,\u201d it wrote. \u201cGoals such as his exquisite overhead kick in March helped Leicester keep up a momentum they never lost.\u201d A Leicester fan living near Tokyo offered help with the city\u2019s often mispronounced name.

You know, the usual. And then to see them keep defying the odds, game after game, I started to follow again.\u201d The unofficial Leicester supporters club in Japan tweeted: \u201cWe live Japan but, our hearts are always together!!!\u201d    Thank you for all congrats messages from all over the world!We live Japan but, our hearts are always together!!! pic.twitter.com/RCqDeQUQMc\u2014 Leicester City Japan (@Leicester_CityJ) May 2, 2016    In Okazaki\u2019s hometown, Takarazuka, people spoke of their pride. \u201cI\u2019m bursting with happiness that Okazaki plays for this team,\u201d one resident wrote.  \u201cTakarazuka pride!

The duty-free magnate has flown Buddhist monks to bless King Power stadium, named after his company, and raised a portrait of the Thai king at the grounds. Many supporters on Leicester City\u2019s Thai Facebook page, which has nearly 600,000 members, shared photos of themselves holding up talismanic cloths, which are blessed by Buddhist monks. \u201cGoosebumps! Cheering on Leicester City is like cheering on the Thai national team. Foreigners say it\u2019s a Thai team - not Mr Vichai\u2019s team,\u201d wrote user Imnanmanas. The club is known as the \u201cSiamese Foxes\u201d in the south-east Asian nation.

Wang Song Ao Han, a 26-year-old, became a Foxes fan back in 2014 when he was studying at the University of Leicester for a master\u2019s degree in media and advertising. Wang was a regular at the King Power Stadium and said Monday night\u2019s victory had left him on the verge of tears. \u201cI have no words to express how I am feeling. It\u2019s probably one of the best feelings I have ever felt in my entire life,\u201d said Wang who lives in Beijing but is originally from Tongliao, a city of about three million inhabitants towards China\u2019s border with Mongolia and Russia. \u201cI watched Leicester when they were virtually unheard of. Hardly any Chinese journalists knew about them. Even in the UK, it isn\u2019t a well-known city. It\u2019s a very small,\u201d Wang went on. \u201cIt is really hard to express the feeling of seeing a team go from being a complete nobody to being today\u2019s Premier League champion.\u201d In Indonesia, \u201cLeicester City\u201d was the top trending tweet.    1.

John Perry in Nicaragua said: \u201cI\u2019ve supported Leicester City for over 30 years, mainly because my late son Joss dragged me to the games when he was about 10 years old. It\u2019s fantastic to see a team that you\u2019ve watched being relegated to League One having such an amazing season. What a team, what a manager, what a club, what a city!\u201d   Related: Leicester City win the Premier League title: latest updates \u2013 live!    Riley Strother was alone at Race Rocks lighthouse \u201cwhich is situated on a tiny island on the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, and I am ecstatic about Leicester becoming champions!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Newcastle fan, but since the start of the season I have been pulling for Leicester to pull off this incredible upset, and for the last few months I\u2019ve been following every game out here on this rock. \u201cEven though there are only seals and sea lions to confirm it, I am indeed dancing for joy!\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
