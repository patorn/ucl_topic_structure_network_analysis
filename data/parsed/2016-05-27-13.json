  "body": "The Victorian electorate of Indi is vast, stretching from the border with New South Wales through dairy farms and fruit orchards, from ski resorts, valleys and plains to the regional cities of Wodonga and Wangaratta. But in other ways it is a small place, too. On Murphy Street in Wangaratta, its wide pavements sprinkled with the last of the autumn leaves, Marty Corboy has set up his campaign office for the National party. Right next door, emblazoned in her signature orange, is the office of Cathy McGowan, the independent who won the seat at the last federal election, and down the street is her volunteer \u201chub\u201d. Just around the corner in Reid Street is Sophie Mirabella\u2019s office, with a poster of herself and her Liberal leader, Malcolm Turnbull, in the window. On this day, the office is closed, with a note on the door saying her team are \u201cout and about in the electorate\u201d and calling for volunteers. There is something claustrophobic about how close these offices are \u2013 everyone can see who is popping in to see a candidate, who\u2019s campaigning where. Everyone knows each other. Some candidates belong to the same Rotary club, have children of the same age, and have put themselves forward for election again and again. The candidates and the voters gossip about this election using first names: Cathy, Sophie and Marty \u2013 and Eric and Jenny and a couple of others \u2013 are running for Indi.    Everyone\u2019s happy to talk to Cathy \u2013 that\u2019s great, but she\u2019s tepid  Jenny O'Connor, Greens candidate     Elections in rural seats may be consumed with small-town politics, local problems and personalities, but this north-eastern Victorian electorate has earned its place in a national conversation. Indi was the sensational story of election night 2013, when McGowan, a 59-year-old farmer and rural consultant from the Indigo valley, harvested enough preferences from other candidates to win by just 439 votes and end Mirabella\u2019s 12 years as MP. The Coalition won the national election emphatically; only in Indi did a Liberal incumbent lose. There were singular factors \u2013 McGowan\u2019s personal warmth and the respect she had earned after decades working on agricultural issues, particularly women on the land, and Mirabella\u2019s combative style and regular absences owing to her job as a frontbencher and conservative warrior. Yet McGowan stirred something. She wanted to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d and her exuberant campaign, which famously began with \u201ckitchen-table conversations\u201d for residents to talk about what they wanted from politics, inspired many people, especially young people, to become involved for the first time. She raised almost $120,000 in donations \u2013 remarkable for an independent. In an era when the disengagement of voters is taken for granted, when political cynicism is assumed, McGowan\u2019s campaign was full of fun and purpose. \u201cWe have given the community of Indi ownership,\u201d McGowan said in her victory speech. \u201cThe rest of Australia will look upon what Indi does and say, \u2018That\u2019s a good idea, we could try that.\u2019\u201d  Almost three years on, McGowan, now 62, is no longer a fresh face. She has a record to defend and has inevitably let some people down. Her tribe of supporters say she shook up this electorate and embodies a reimagining of how politics can work. But she has critics, too, who question whether her relentless local focus is too parochial for federal politics.   Related: Indi's National hopeful: 'Some people are rapt to have a man to vote for'    \u201cCathy would be a wonderful mayor,\u201d says Jenny O\u2019Connor, who is standing for the Greens for the fourth time in Indi. O\u2019Connor is a nurse and a local councillor, a rare Green elected to a rural shire. At the last election she convinced head office to preference McGowan rather than run an open ticket. She has recommended the same this time, and expects McGowan to win. But O\u2019Connor has been disappointed in McGowan, and she is sceptical that her victory marks a broader symbol of political possibility. McGowan is a \u201clovely, endearing person\u201d, a fabulous community organiser, but an unimpressive politician, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more like she\u2019s a benign presence, everyone\u2019s happy to talk to Cathy \u2013 that\u2019s great, but she\u2019s tepid.\u201d O\u2019Connor remembers McGowan making a speech in parliament congratulating the town of Yackandandah for its recognition by Guinness World Records for making the world\u2019s longest bunting \u2013 all 7.7823 km of it. \u201cIt was hilarious,\u201d says O\u2019Connor. \u201cIt\u2019s not the CWA, it\u2019s parliament!\u201d Yes, but what did the electorate think? \u201cThey loved it,\u201d she concedes.     Sophie Mirabella. The Liberal candidate declined to be interviewed in person but emailed a response to some questions. \u2018Unfortunately for Ms McGowan, our system of government requires the formation of a government,\u2019 she told Guardian Australia. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP    Green v orange McGowan\u2019s political philosophy is not that of O\u2019Connor\u2019s, who thinks politicians of whatever stripe should lead and \u201cargue the toss\u201d for what they believe in. O\u2019Connor was stunned by what McGowan told local media during the last campaign: \u201cI won\u2019t be having policies as such.\u201d McGowan had thought deeply about how she wanted to represent people she known all her life. She was to be a listener, and take her electorate\u2019s view to Canberra, to work with every side of politics to achieve practical outcomes for a region that is more disadvantaged than most \u2013older, and less educated. At this election, she remains committed to that philosophy  . A few days ago she bustled around at the opening of her Wangaratta \u201chub\u201d, the central meeting place for campaign volunteers. She wore a bright orange scarf, of course, and modest pearl earrings. There was a buzz in the room, a reminder of that 2013 feel-good feeling. On the wall were orange posters outlining Indi \u201cvalues\u201d: Respect, Inclusivity, Positivity, Courage, Trust, Integrity.   Related: David Marr on the one thing that's stopping the Coalition from ruling forever \u2013 podcast    The message this time is \u201ckeep the seat orange\u201d. An orange chair is at the entrance, and on it a cushion stamped with one word: smile. A beaming McGowan addresses about 60 volunteers in her \u201cAunty Cathy\u201d style \u2013 she has 12 siblings and umpteen nieces and nephews, so \u201caunty\u201d suits. She wants to talk about the \u201chow and the why\u201d of the campaign. The \u201cwhy\u201d is winning \u2013 \u201cBut there\u2019s another why, it\u2019s what we do with the next three years, it\u2019s the Indi way of how we\u2019re working, having conversations, making connections.\u201d  The how? She urges volunteers to have \u201cone meaningful conversation a day \u2026 invite people to have a conversation about democracy\u201d. She wants to see orange chairs on verandas, yards, roofs, everywhere. Maybe this campaign will never be as thrilling as the last one but the energy is still there. Many of the so-called \u201cIndi expats\u201d \u2013 all those 20-somethings from Melbourne who swooped in and helped out last time \u2013 are pitching in again. The 2013 media adviser Cam Klose is taking time off work next month to volunteer, as is Nick Haines, an innovative fundraiser and social media expert. The next day, McGowan is her Wodonga office 70km down the Hume Highway, talking about whether her ideals have been confirmed or dampened by the realities of Canberra. She was one of five independent and minor-party MPs in parliament and did not hold the balance of power to wrest concessions from the government. \u201cI\u2019m even more optimistic now and more confident that what we\u2019re trying to do is good,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really clear that my job is to represent my community, and in the process to deliver things for the community, bring people together so we can and get the outcome that we want. People look at me and say, \u2018But, but, but.\u2019 I say it\u2019s called the House of Representatives; I\u2019m called a representative. So I say to my party colleagues, \u201cHow well do you represent your community?\u2019\u201d     Indi\u2019s election candidates at a forum in Wodonga. From left to right: Marty Corboy, Nationals; Jenny O\u2019Connor, Greens; Sophie Mirabella, Liberals; Eric Kerr Labor; Cathy McGowan, independent. Photograph: Gay Alcorn for the Guardian    The example she offers to highlight how her methods work is mobile phone blackspots. Having little or no reception is a big issue in regional and rural Australia, and the problem is horrible in Indi, with all its rolling hills and valleys. McGowan believes it is the biggest issue in this election. In 2014 the federal government offered $100m to help fix blackspots across the country. McGowan took advice and was told she needed a plan to make sure towns and communities didn\u2019t fight each other for scarce resources. McGowan loves a plan. She helped set up the Indi Telecommunications Action Group and rattles off what happened next: the community identified where the blackspots were, checked it all with Telstra, set up priorities, worked with the federal department and consulted the Victorian government.  \u201cThen we took it to government, we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the Indi plan on this,\u2019 which had agreement with all the local governments and all the other responsible bodies and, lo and behold, it worked very well. \u201cThere was no mistake attached to that, it was deliberate process of consulting and engaging, bringing people together, having a strategy, doing the work. To my knowledge, no other member of parliament had a whole-of-electorate plan.\u201d Indi did exceptionally well. In the first round announced last year, Indi got 30 mobile base stations, enough to fix almost 200 of the nearly 300 identified blackspots. Indi was the third most successful electorate in the country, with only the sparse West Australian seats of Durack and O\u2019Connor getting more.   Related: Sophie Mirabella: Wangaratta hospital lost $10m when I was voted out    Mirabella has dismissed McGowan\u2019s role in all this as \u201cnot a genuine claim\u201d, given that the process was independent. More money will flow to Indi during this campaign to help fix more blackspots. Yet many citizens participated and give her some credit. Sue Sullivan lives in the remote Nariel valley, which still has no mobile coverage \u2013 she had to rely on sight alone to escape a bushfire in 2003 because all communications were down. Sullivan turned up to a meeting organised by McGowan. \u201cShe really went out to the community and said, \u2018Who amongst you have got problems?\u2019  \u201cIt\u2019s difficult being an independent. She doesn\u2019t probably have the same influence, but she does advise us on how to get things done and she gets them done, which is fantastic.\u201d At the same time as the blackspot money was announced, Mirabella won preselection to try to wrest a once predictably conservative seat back from an independent. The Liberal said she had learned and changed. She needed to \u201cget back to the grassroots\u201d and listen to her electorate. McGowan\u2019s way had impact. Who can deliver? The central argument of McGowan\u2019s opponents is that independents and minor parties such as the Greens can promise the world but can\u2019t deliver. It\u2019s a hoary debate in one sense, and fewer voters are heeding it. At the last election, a record number of Australians abandoned the major parties. More than one in five voted for an independent or minor-party candidate in the House of Representatives, and about one in three in the Senate. The disillusionment with establishment parties is a global trend, in the US and Europe as much as in Australia, and it doesn\u2019t appear to be fading.  The impotence of independents was the point Mirabella was making during a televised debate last month, when she claimed she had a commitment to announce $10m for the Wangaratta hospital after the 2013 election but that the money had been withdrawn by the government because the electorate had chosen McGowan \u2013 a claim the health minister, Sussan Ley, denied.  Is this how politics works or should work, punishing and rewarding citizens based on how they vote? Was Mirabella just being honest, even if it backfired against her? The candidate clarified her statement later, saying she would have been a strong advocate for the money to go to the hospital \u2013that she had the connections and knowledge that an independent would lack.  The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, was in Indi last week to formally launch Corboy\u2019s campaign. He wanted to scoff at independents, too. He should know all about it, as he is facing a challenge from the popular independent Tony Windsor in the NSW seat of New England.  Standing on green milk crates, Joyce told loyalists that independents may be \u201cwonderful people\u201d but it was an \u201ceasy trick\u201d \u2013 they took credit for good results, and slammed everyone else for bad ones. Voters needed to realise that to achieve something, \u201cYou have got to get close to the person making decisions. Ministers announce things and ministers have the authority to deliver and ministers are in political parties.\u201d His point was that Corboy would have access to ministers in a Coalition government.     Marty Corboy, the Nationals candidate in the seat of Indi, with party leader and deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce. \u2018I just feel that people want honest representation, and they\u2019re looking for the Nationals to provide it,\u2019 Corboy says. Photograph: Gay Alcorn for the Guardian    McGowan rolls her eyes. \u201cIf that were true, it would be saying that every single backbencher is powerless, it would be saying that the opposition is powerless, and clearly that\u2019s not the case. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good operator in parliament and you can work with people you can get things done. You could be a member of one of the major parties and just sit there and hold your seat and do nothing for your community and nothing for government. That\u2019s the question to ask Barnaby, \u2018Is she an effective representative?\u2019 Yes. \u2018Has she been able to get things for her community?\u2019 Yes.\u201d The people of Indi will decide whether McGowan\u2019s approach has impressed them or whether they are better off in the party fold. One goal last time was to make Indi a marginal seat because a safe seat could be taken for granted. McGowan got her wish, winning Indi by 0.3 percentage points \u2013 making it one of the most marginal electorates in the country. Second coming It has been assumed for months that the political contest would be a lively rerun between McGowan and Mirabella but so far it has not turned out that way. Mirabella declined several requests for an interview. I ask her again before a candidates\u2019 debate in Wodonga, insisting I want to talk about the issues, not the personalities. \u201cThat\u2019s what they all say,\u201d she says. Mirabella surprised many when she chose to stand again after such a humiliating defeat and she is at least given credit for guts. O\u2019Connor has known her since she first ran against her in 2004. She opposes almost all of Mirabella\u2019s \u201chard right\u201d politics, but \u201cshe\u2019s irreverent, she\u2019s rude, she\u2019s naughty, I like that\u201d.    Cathy didn\u2019t win Indi last time, Sophie lost  National party supporter     \u201cWas I surprised she was going to put herself through it again? Oh my god yes. This is wounding her. She is on a hiding to nowhere because her own party has walked away from her. I don\u2019t want to see her suffer and I wish for her sake that she\u2019d been able to let it go.\u201d It appears to be true that her own side of politics has walked away from her, at least at this stage of the campaign. Both the Liberals and Nationals speak of Mirabella with thinly veiled disdain, and it is well known that the Liberal hierarchy in Melbourne didn\u2019t want her to run. One Liberal staffer, who declined to be named, said Mirabella had \u201cnot a snowball\u2019s chance in hell\u201d of winning back the seat she held for 12 years.  One National said what they all think: \u201cCathy didn\u2019t win Indi last time, Sophie lost.\u201d At the candidates\u2019 forum, Mirabella gives no hint of the strain. She laughs with the other candidates and talks to anyone who wants to chat after the debate finishes. She can\u2019t help that her face reveals what she\u2019s thinking \u2013 she looks to the heavens when some candidates say this country is not doing enough on climate change, and almost rolls her eyes at the thought that Australia\u2019s asylum seeker regime should be dismantled. Also on the stage is Corboy, and it is the National party that has turned out to be the Indi wildcard. The Nationals believe this is their heartland. The party has not won the seat since 1977 and hasn\u2019t been able to stand a candidate under Coalition rules since Mirabella was elected 15 years ago. Back then they gained a paltry 12.3% of the vote. They can stand a candidate now because Mirabella lost, at least in part because many prominent Nationals publicly or privately supported McGowan. The well-known Ken Jasper, a state MP for more than 30 years, endorsed McGowan in 2013 but won\u2019t this time.  \u201cThere was no Nationals\u2019 candidate at the last election so it was a different ball game,\u201d he told the local paper.  Sit down with a National and they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s all about which candidate comes first, second and third on primary votes. If McGowan tops the vote, which is expected, and Mirabella comes second and Corboy third (and therefore his preferences are distributed before Mirabella\u2019s), that could advantage McGowan, because some of Corboy\u2019s votes would be expected to flow to the independent.   Related: Can Melbourne love Malcolm?    \u201cThe likely result is really up in the air now,\u201d says Prof Brian Costar, who wrote the book Rebels with a Cause about independents and who is watching Indi closely. \u201cAs strange as this may seem, if Mirabella is forced into third position, in a sense that endangers McGowan more than if Mirabella were in second position because the Liberal preferences would be more disciplined than the National party preferences.  \u201cIt\u2019s no great secret that the Victorian Nationals don\u2019t hold Mirabella in very high esteem and they are still smarting about losing the seat all those years ago.\u201d Joyce dismisses Mirabella\u2019s campaign, saying the election is \u201cbetween Cathy and Marty\u201d. McGowan\u2019s team is wondering about that too, and is planning to do polling to find out how the Nationals are faring. Everyone says they like Corboy, who works in his family\u2019s stock feeding business in Wangaratta. At 36, he is open-faced and friendly, and still has an air of inexperience about him despite standing for preselection and as a candidate numerous times, including his first tilt for the conservative Christian party Family First in 2006. At his campaign launch, his six children \u2013 Xavier, 11, William, nine, Dominic, seven, Edward, five, Bridget, four, and Nicholas, 18 months \u2013 tear around the room, the boys sporting starched collars and ties. His wife, Annelisa, is due to give birth to their seventh child a few weeks after the election. As Corboy walks from his office to a nearby coffee shop, a woman stops to shake his hand and wish him well. He can \u201cfeel something\u201d stirring, he says. \u201cI just feel that people want honest representation, and they\u2019re looking for the Nationals to provide it,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a feeling they don\u2019t want to take a step backwards [to Mirabella], and I also have a feeling that they have tried the independent and people think, \u2018Oh, you know did that work for us? Not so sure.\u2019 I\u2019m the piggy in the middle.\u201d He laughs, happy to come through the middle while everyone is fascinated by the McGowan and Mirabella show. \u201cWe always thought we could win this, but as every day ticks on, it\u2019s becoming more and more of a reality.\u201d Corboy can specify no policy differences between himself and Mirabella, and says the main reason people should vote for him is that \u201cthe Nationals are the only party dedicated to representing the regions\u201d. His personal politics could prove controversial. He says he stood for Family First almost by accident. He first declined the party\u2019s offer to run for the Victorian seat of Benambra, but \u201cthe day before nominations closed they rang again and said we really need a candidate, can you do it? I said, \u2018Yeah all right, bloody hell, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d He loved politics, didn\u2019t like the party, and joined the Nationals in 2008. He is the eldest of 10 children, part of a family of strong Catholics. His faith \u201cwill impact my political thinking just the same way as someone\u2019s lack of faith will impact theirs. It\u2019s who I am, it\u2019s part of the many stitches that make up Marty.\u201d He is against abortion, even in the hardest cases of pregnancy through rape or incest. \u201cOne of my best friends was conceived in rape,\u201d he says by way of explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult situation, but abortion\u2019s one of those topics that needs to be treated with tact and respect because the situation that drives a woman to that must be considered, but at the same time you\u2019ve got two conflicting rights, of the strong rights of a woman but then the right to life, you know. I\u2019m really getting deep here. For me I just have to side with life because they are a person to me.\u201d He says \u201cyes and no\u201d to the question of whether he would pursue his anti-abortion views in parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue I do have a view on but it\u2019s not one to bang the drum on.\u201d Labor\u2019s independent-minded candidate     Eric Kerr, Labor\u2019s candidate for Indi, as a boy with his two mothers and his twin brother, Jeremy. Photograph: Twitter    Corboy\u2019s idea of politics is relatively uncomplicated \u2013 he supports the Nationals\u2019 policies and wants to do good things for his community. For Labor\u2019s Eric Kerr, just 22, politics means wrestling with his conscience. Kerr was elected a Wodonga councillor when he was just 18. He is whip smart, well briefed on the issues, and likable. Yet he looks tortured when asked about Australia\u2019s asylum seeker policy. \u201cAh, so, it\u2019s a horribly difficult area,\u201d he says, looking down at his notes. \u201cI think everyone knows my personal position on this, that I hold grave concerns for offshore processing.\u201d A dozen or more Labor candidates have called for the end of the boats turnback policy, or mandatory detention, or offshore processing, despite Labor\u2019s near-identical position with the government on these issues. Many backtracked when the government sought to exploit a \u201cdivision\u201d in Labor, insisting that they now supported Labor\u2019s policy.   Related: Personal pushes aside policy in McGowan-Mirabella Indi election debate    Kerr won\u2019t demur, even though he knows he has little chance of winning conservative Indi. He says the boats haven\u2019t stopped, we\u2019re just not seeing them. \u201cWhat we are seeing is people self-immolating, children self-harming, people being murdered, and this is all real, it isn\u2019t stuff we can hide away.\u201d After the forum, he has a phone full of messages and wonders if he\u2019s about to be censured by the party \u2013 he says later he was not. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience support a policy that allows this to happen \u2026 it\u2019s fine to say you hold grave concerns because any decent human would. So in one way no, I\u2019m not helping [Labor] on this one issue, I\u2019m not being compliant.\u201d    She\u2019s highly principled and that is out of the ordinary  Andrew Wilkie on Cathy McGowan     Kerr admires McGowan for giving Indi \u201cthe shakeup it needed\u201d. But he is \u201cvery angry\u201d with her on an issue that highlights the broader criticism of the MP\u2019s approach. Kerr has two mothers, Roslyn Kerr and Debra Brindley, who conceived Eric and his twin brother Jeremy though IVF. Not only does he support marriage equality \u2013 \u201chell yes\u201d is his answer \u2013 but he finds the idea of a plebiscite on the issue \u201cabsolutely disgusting \u2013 anyone who supports a plebiscite should be ashamed\u201d. Listen to McGowan speak and you would think she was a steadfast supporter of marriage equality, and she is. Listed on her website is her speech as a co-sponsor of a bill introduced last year that would have legalised same-sex marriage, a bill that was never put to a parliamentary vote. \u201cPeople in my electorate want this dealt with and dealt with quickly,\u201d she reportedly said at the time.  Yet she now supports a plebiscite on same-sex marriage, a notion opposed by most supporters on the grounds that it is an unnecessary delaying tactic cooked up by opponents, would cost millions and could be harmful to families like Kerr\u2019s. Her explanation is that she would have preferred it had been dealt with in parliament through a conscience vote, but because that option was removed, \u201cI support the government taking this issue to a public vote.\u201d One view of McGowan is that she struggled in the early days to handle the contentious issues of politics beyond what was good for the single seat of Indi. Her win depended on Liberal and Greens voters turning to her as the best chance to defeat Mirabella as well as some conservative voters who sought a change. Her supporters are often more progressive than her electorate and McGowan straddles that, insisting she does what\u2019s best for Indi. She has voted with the government 443 times, according to her website, and with the opposition 32 times, notably in favour of retaining the carbon tax and against the government\u2019s plans to deregulate university fees. Asylum seekers may not be the biggest issue in Indi \u2013 this is not western Sydney \u2013 but their fate can\u2019t be avoided. There is some confusion about what McGowan\u2019s views are and how she has communicated them. She spoke with emotion at the candidates\u2019 debate: \u201cThis whole question of our treatment of asylum seekers is just a blot on our nation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are punishing people who are refugees, we are putting them in indefinite detention in the worst possible conditions \u2026  \u201cWe have got to look after our borders, for sure, we\u2019ve got to stop people from dying at sea, no one wants that. But is the answer that we\u2019ve come up with the way of doing it? It\u2019s going to be a black cloud against our nation for years to come.\u201d What she doesn\u2019t tell the audience is that she supports the key elements of Australia\u2019s broadly bipartisan asylum seeker policies, including mandatory detention and offshore processing of asylum seekers who attempt to arrive by boat. She\u2019d like Australia to be \u201cbetter\u201d about how we go about it, be more humane, faster at processing asylum claims and more welcoming to refugees.     One of the walls at Cathy McGowan\u2019s campaign hub in Wangaratta. Photograph: Gay Alcorn for the Guardian    On her website, McGowan notes that she seconded a 2014 motion from a fellow independent, Andrew Wilkie, that would have limited mandatory detention to 14 days, ended offshore processing and scrapped temporary protection visas. But she disagreed with Wilkie\u2019s bill \u2013 which never got to a vote \u2013 something not mentioned on her website. She says she seconded it not because she supported it, but to allow it to be discussed. And last year the government and Labor joined forces to push through an urgent bill to explicitly authorise the offshore detention regime and its funding after a loophole was identified that might have meant the regime was illegal.  McGowan says she agonised over that bill. There was little time to consider it, and she was \u201creally stressed\u201d about it. But she did support it, even though the legislation never went to a formal vote. \u201cI do support government on it,\u201d she says. \u201cMy part as an independent member is to work with the government of the day to achieve a good result.\u201d If Australia is to have offshore detention, it needs to be properly funded. Does she support the closure of the Manus Island and Nauru detention centres? \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about what I think about this,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf it\u2019s government policy that\u2019s been voted in by the people of Australia, both major parties [support it] \u2026 we should do it well.\u201d This idea is central what McGowan believes to be her role. She is non-confrontational, a networker and consulter across party lines. The Greens are scathing. \u201cCathy voted to support the legalisation of Manus Island and Nauru, that is absolutely against everything she says,\u201d says O\u2019Connor. \u201cShe either doesn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s voting for which is not OK, or she\u2019s voted for something and tries to get out of it which is not OK. She can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d Wilkie has been consistently opposed to Australia\u2019s asylum regime and was disappointed by some of McGowan\u2019s parliamentary votes, but he is not so harsh. \u201c[The criticism] is unfair to her,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you look at the weight of her votes and what she\u2019s done, the bottom line is that she\u2019s pretty good and she\u2019s a darn sight better than most other people.\u201d Besides, she is \u201ctireless with the workload she takes on in the house, she\u2019s refreshingly nice, and that\u2019s quite unusual in Canberra. She\u2019s highly principled and that is out of the ordinary.\u201d     Cathy McGowan at the opening of her campaign hub in Wangaratta. \u2018People want to be involved in politics if you trust them to come together and engage them in the process.\u2019 Photograph: Gay Alcorn for the Guardian    Whose side are you on? There is one question McGowan is reluctant to answer, and it is the only time she sounds even a little testy. She won\u2019t say which party she would support if the election results in a hung parliament, where no party has a clear majority. It is a hypothetical question, but a relevant one given the tight contest and because the independents Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott surprised many of their rural constituents when they supported Julia Gillard to form government after the 2010 election. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a deal,\u201d she says. \u201cI won\u2019t have sold my vote to either political party in return for something in order to get something.\u201d She will look at every piece of legislation that comes up as she has done for the past two and a half years. She will consult with her community, and do what\u2019s best for Indi. But which party would she support if it came to a confidence motion, which party would she support to form government? \u201cI\u2019m not going to say the what ifs, because I don\u2019t think you guys know the what ifs, I don\u2019t think Australia knows what ifs, and it would be such a dereliction of my duty to be putting myself out two months ahead and doing what ifs.\u201d Mirabella won\u2019t be interviewed in person but she replies quickly to an email on this question, arguing that Indi voters deserve an answer before polling day. \u201cThis issue highlights the great flaw in Ms McGowan\u2019s position,\u201d she writes. \u201cFor example, she supports a carbon tax \u2013 would she guarantee supply and confidence to a Turnbull government which has a contrary position? \u201cUnfortunately for Ms McGowan, our system of government requires the formation of a government \u2026 Ms McGowan says there will be no deals and assuming that neither of the major parties will be significantly changing their position on any issue, what\u2019s going to change between now and July 2 that would influence which leader an independent would support \u2013 Bill or Malcolm?\u201d   Related: For Indi's Labor candidate (and his two mothers), one issue is a no-brainer    \u201cIn theory, politicians and governments get elected on the basis of what they stand for. In effect Ms McGowan says she doesn\u2019t stand for anything.\u201d McGowan, of course, says she stands for Indi. If she gets re-elected, she has lots of ideas. She wants to start an organisation to coordinate arts groups across the electorate. She wants an Indi renewable energy group, with the aim of an electorate powered entirely by renewables. She is careful to avoid suggesting that her way could be copied in other parts of the country. Every seat is different; every candidate has their own skills and interests. But she is optimistic about winning Indi for a second time and she believes it is because of the way she has gone about representing her seat. There are Indi \u201cprinciples\u201d that could be applied anywhere. \u201cPeople want to be involved in politics if you trust them to come together and engage them in the process,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich is what democracy is about and, I think, it works.\u201d",
