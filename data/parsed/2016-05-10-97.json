  "body": "Ted Cruz refused to commit his support to Donald Trump as the Republican nominee on Tuesday, and did not rule out resurrecting his campaign for president despite having dropped out of the race last week. In an interview with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, the Texas senator said that picking a presidential candidate \u201cis not a choice that we as voters have to make today\u201d.  His comments came as Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who suspended his own presidential bid in March, said he would support Trump as the nominee. During an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Rubio said he intended to stick to a pledge signed by all of the Republican candidates last year to back the eventual nominee. \u201cI signed a pledge, put my name on it, and said I would support the Republican nominee and that\u2019s what I intend to do,\u201d Rubio said. Cruz appeared less bound by the pledge, which has already been discarded by former contenders Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham \u2013 both of whom have come out against Trump despite his all but clinching the Republican nomination.  Cruz pointed out there were still two months until the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and six months until the general election, saying \u201cwe need to watch and see what the candidates say and do\u201d. Although Cruz had long committed to supporting the Republican nominee in the past, his tone changed after Trump repeatedly made personal attacks against Cruz and his family.  The businessman branded his rival \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d, threatened to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on his wife while implying she was unattractive, and accused Cruz\u2019s father of involvement in the assassination of John F Kennedy. While Cruz once called Trump \u201ca friend\u201d and \u201cterrific\u201d, he held an abrupt press conference hours before ending his campaign at which he derided Trump as a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d, an \u201camoral pathological liar\u201d, and a \u201cbraggadocious, arrogant buffoon\u201d.           Cruz attacks Trump for linking his father to JFK assassination     Related: Ted Cruz, the master strategist, was no match for Trump's cult of personality    Nor would Cruz rule out returning to the campaign trail if \u201cthere\u2019s a path to victory\u201d. The Texas senator suspended his campaign after losing the Indiana primary on 3 May by a margin of 53%-37%, and said that with the loss he no longer saw a path to the Republican nomination. On Tuesday, Cruz told Beck: \u201cIf that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly.\u201d However, Cruz\u2019s campaign had a well-organized effort to put his supporters into positions of power among Republican delegates, who will elect the party\u2019s nominee at the national convention in Cleveland this July. This effort means that although Trump is the only candidate left in the Republican primary, Cruz supporters will have significant influence on the convention floor, and that his delegates will probably hold control of crucial committees, such as those that write the convention rules and design the party\u2019s platform.  Cruz made clear that a return to the trail was very unlikely, though he would not rule it out. \u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath,\u201d he said, in response to questioning about a primary election in Nebraska, also on Tuesday, that he was once expected to win. The Texas senator did dismiss the possibility of running as a third-party candidate or supporting a third-party alternative in November. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s very likely,\u201d he told Beck. \u201cIt\u2019s always talked about; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that\u2019s likely to happen.\u201d  Cruz\u2019s statements followed Trump\u2019s continued failure to unite the Republican party behind him. Two former presidents have said they will not back him and key party figures like the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, have declined to endorse him, at least for the present. The former reality television star is scheduled to meet Republican congressional leaders in Washington on Thursday, as part of his effort to heal the rifts within the party.  Rubio said while he stood by his prior criticisms of Trump \u2013 which included dubbing his former opponent \u201can erratic con artist\u201d \u2013 Republican primary voters had made their choice clear. \u201cMy differences with Donald \u2013 both my reservations about his campaign and my policy differences with him \u2013 are well documented and they remain,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to sit here right now and become his chief critic over the next six months, because he deserves the opportunity to go forward and make his argument and try to win.\u201d He added: \u201cI know what I said during the campaign; I enunciated those things repeatedly. And voters chose a different direction. I stand by the things that I said.\u201d Rubio nonetheless declined to offer Trump an explicit endorsement, hedging when asked if he planned to vote for the billionaire in November.  \u201cI intend to support the nominee,\u201d Rubio said.  Pressed again by the CNN host Jake Tapper on whether that meant casting a ballot in Trump\u2019s favor, Rubio responded: \u201cI\u2019m not voting for Hillary Clinton. I\u2019m not throwing away my vote.\u201d",
