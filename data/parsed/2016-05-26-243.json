Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, was in talks until late on Wednesday night with Jorge Mendes, Mourinho\u2019s agent, and Chelsea, along with lawyers for the three parties.    Wow. All the Jose Mourinho trademarks owned by Chelsea. Includes lipsticks, lingerie, cigar holders etc. Crazy! pic.twitter.com/KRbLmumUzd\u2014 Venkat Ananth (@venkatananth) May 26, 2016    It is understood Chelsea bought the rights to Mourinho\u2019s name and image in 2005, a year into the first of his two tenures at Stamford Bridge. European Union Intellectual Property Office records show that Chelsea Football Club Limited owns the trademark for five classes of goods until 31 March, 2025. The application was filed in March 2005 and registered in April 2006, covering items varying from umbrellas to watch straps, and lingerie to talcum powders The trademark for Mourinho\u2019s name with another two classes of products was registered to Chelsea Football Club Limited in November 2013, running until June 2023. Chelsea refused to comment. Mourinho called United a \u201cmonster club\u201d last October and the German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger is excited by his impending arrival. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who will be our new manager yet, but it looks like it\u2019s going to be an interesting derby in Manchester next season,\u201d the Germany captain said, with Pep Guardiola arriving at the Etihad Stadium. \u201cThe enthusiasm for football in Manchester is great and if Mourinho does take over at United, I think all of the players want to train under him so it\u2019s going to be quite a special season.\u201d",
