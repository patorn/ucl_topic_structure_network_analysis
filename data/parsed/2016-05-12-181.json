  "body": "It features five singles \u2013 two of them silver-certified hits \u2013 guest appearances from A$AP Mob\u2019s Young Lord and A$AP Nast and a collaboration with Pharrell Williams, but the most telling track on Skepta\u2019s fourth album might well be one that contains no music at all. As a tense bit of old-fashioned grime called Corn on the Curb unexpectedly ends \u2013 Skepta apparently forgetting the lyrics midway through a line, the sparse musical backing grinding to a halt \u2013 it\u2019s replaced by the sound of a phone call between Skepta and fellow rapper Chip. The former sounds despondent, which comes as something of a surprise.   Related: The best track of 2015: Shutdown by Skepta    After all, Skepta is credited as an architect of grime\u2019s astonishing commercial resurgence in the UK, helping shift it from a genre so underground that its artists could apparently only gain wider recognition if they gave up making it altogether and threw in their lot with straightforward pop music, to its current exalted position where grime MCs are stars, capable of gatecrashing the charts without the aid of the mainstream music industry: \u201cNo label, no PR, no publisher, no manager, no PA, no stylist,\u201d as the Twitter bio of Skepta\u2019s brother JME proudly boasts. At the time of writing, Konnichiwa is battling it out with Radiohead\u2019s A Moon Shaped Pool to unseat Beyonc\u00e9 from the top of the album charts, while its author is potentially teetering on the brink of even bigger things overseas: Drake, for one, appears to be intent on furthering his career in the US, curiously announcing that he\u2019s signing to Skepta\u2019s indie label Boy Better Know, showing off his recently inked tattoo of the label\u2019s initials and posting a photo of himself waving a copy of Konnichiwa at the camera on Instagram. All this appears to have brought its share of problems for Skepta. \u201cMad pressures from every angle,\u201d he disconsolately mutters on the phone to Chip. \u201cI\u2019m too ambitious to be with the mandem on the road but I can\u2019t be up there with them people, either \u2013 I\u2019m too black. I feel like I\u2019m in limbo.\u201d            Chip is having none of it. \u201cYou\u2019re going mad, fam,\u201d he reassures him. \u201cWe ain\u2019t seen nothing like this before.\u201d But the sense of an artist poised between two worlds haunts Konnichiwa. At one extreme, there are songs that clearly look towards the US market \u2013 traditionally resistant to UK rappers \u2013 not least the R&B-based Ladies Hit Squad, which debuted on Drake\u2019s OVO Sound Radio Show, and the Pharrell-produced Numbers. At the other, there is a great deal of musical and lyrical underlining of Skepta\u2019s commitment to the grime scene, a lot of it placed at the start of the album: the opening tracks are a thrillingly unreconstructed splurge of choppy rhythms, low-rent electronics and pummelling bass.  Lyrics opens with the sound of Wiley pleading for calm during what seems to have been an extremely lively night at Watford\u2019s Destiny nightclub in 2001. The same rapper\u2019s 2004 single Pies forms the basis of That\u2019s Not Me, while his verse on Corn on the Curb goes back even further into the history of UK bass music, mentioning drum\u2019n\u2019bass MCs Skibadee, Bassman and Trigga. The lyrics are packed with reflections on grime\u2019s early days \u2013 the look of old videos, quotations from Dizzee Rascal lyrics, reminiscences about appearances at raves \u2013 and assurances that, at root, nothing has changed: \u201cBoy better know a man went to the Brits on a train,\u201d he says on title track. \u201cMan shut down Wireless and then I walked home in the rain.\u201d    Even his most virulent braggadocio is underscored by a very winning, very British kind of bathos    You can understand why Skepta feels duty-bound to reassure the world he\u2019s not planning on jumping on any passing bandwagons: before the career rethink heralded by his soul-searching 2012 mixtape Blacklisted and cemented by his back-to-basics 2014 single That\u2019s Not Me, Skepta spent four years gamely releasing pop-rap singles of varying degrees of cheesiness, with varying degrees of success. But on the basis of Konnichiwa, any uneasiness he feels about his current artistic position is unfounded: for a man apparently in limbo \u2013 and for all the complaints about his workload he relates on Text Me Back \u2013 he carries himself with a real confidence throughout. The straightforward grime tracks are uniformly great: they reach twin pinnacles on Crime Riddim\u2019s constantly shifting, claustrophobic backdrop of clanks and martial horn blasts, and Man, shot through with a wailing, shivering guitar sample. Moreover, he never sounds cowed in the presence of his US counterparts. Listening to Numbers, it seems that Pharrell might be trying hard to fit in with Skepta\u2019s artistic vision rather than vice-versa: his music is sparse and menacing, and he gamely joins in with the lyrical jabs at major labels, tactfully forgetting that he\u2019s signed to that legendary bastion of redoubtable indie ethics, Sony.        For all that the album self-evidently has one eye fixed on the States, you never get the sense of an artist subjugating his own personality to succeed abroad. It\u2019s not just that the lyrics throughout are dextrous and sharp and funny, although they are. It\u2019s that even his most virulent braggadocio is underscored by a very winning, very British kind of bathos. Held in custody on Crime Riddim, he becomes concerned by his desire to \u201cspend a penny\u201d; among the list of menaces detailed on Corn on the Curb lurks the threat to \u201cshower man down like Fireman Sam\u201d; and while enumerating his many bad-boy credentials, he brags that he sometimes smokes in no-smoking areas.  What Americans will make of it is an intriguing question: for all of Drake\u2019s cheerleading, Azealia Banks\u2019 recent outbursts on Twitter have underlined the kind of resistance grime faces in the US. Over here, it\u2019s another story entirely, the ongoing plot of which Konnichiwa is clearly going to do nothing to alter. \u201cI\u2019ll bet I make you respect me when you see the mandem selling out Wembley,\u201d Skepta snaps at one point. Given his current trajectory, you wouldn\u2019t bet against that happening.",
