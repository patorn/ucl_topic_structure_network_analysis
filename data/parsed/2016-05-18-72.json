The news that Pope Francis is setting up a commission to consider the ordination of female deacons (Report, 13 May) is therefore a cause of serious concern. The sacrament of holy order is one sacrament, not three \u2013 found in its plenitude in the order of bishop, but also present in the orders of deacon and priest. This sacrament in the Catholic church, obedient to the example of Our Lord, has always been confined to men. Some women were described as \u201cdiakonoi\u201d in the early church, but the canons of the Council of Nicaea make clear that they were not regarded as members of the clergy. When liberal churchmen wished to undermine the male-only apostolic ministry which Anglicanism used to share with the rest of Catholic Christendom, they did so by arguing that the creation of women deacons would be a modest step which could be taken without leading to the admission of women to the priesthood and to the episcopate. Many Anglo-Catholics supported this stance, only to find \u2013 to their horror \u2013 that, once the principle had been breached, the pressure for women to be ordained priests and consecrated bishops was unstoppable. This was because the Church of England\u2019s position had become inconsistent and illogical. Pope Francis is playing with fire.Francis BownLondon \u2022 It was saddening \u2013 though not particularly surprising \u2013 to read a representative of Christian Concern claiming that Buddhism and \u201cChristian teaching about God ... are incompatible\u201d (Evangelicals object to Buddhism at minster, 18 May). There may indeed be as many differences as similarities between the two religions (a moot point), but that doesn\u2019t make them wholly incompatible. Such a conclusion will depend on your philosophy of religion. If you start from an exclusivist position then you will always judge others, eventually, to be wrong; but an inclusivist understanding will readily acknowledge that the \u201cone light shed by many separate lanterns\u201d is a unifying principle which may yet offer hope to a world so often fractured along lines of religious \u201cteaching\u201d.Fr Alec MitchellManchester \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
