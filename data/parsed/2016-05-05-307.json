  "body": "A 16-year-old from western Sydney accused of preparing to commit an Anzac Day terrorist attack has been denied bail. Magistrate Christine Haskett said the strength of the crown case, the boy\u2019s apparent \u201cunwillingness to address violent extremist behaviours\u201d and a real risk of flight necessitated against releasing him pending a committal hearing in June. The Parramatta children\u2019s court was read transcripts from alleged encrypted online conversations between the boy and two undercover police officers in the lead up to 25 April, in which he allegedly repeatedly asked for helping sourcing a gun and a bomb manual.

Asked if he was looking to travel to the war-torn country he allegedly replied: \u201cI was not until these kuffar [disbelievers] cancelled my passport. I want to do any attack.\u201d \u201cI want to know how to make a bomb,\u201d he allegedly told the officer, adding later: \u201cDo you think you could me hold of a gun. Even I have to pay, I will.\u201d When the officer asked why he wanted to stage the attack on 25 April, the boy allegedly replied \u201cHere the kuffar celebrate Anzac day and I want to terrorise them on that day\u201d, the court heard. One week later he was contacted by a second officer, Online Covert Persona 2, who said: \u201cI was told you\u2019re looking for Sydney brothers.\u201d \u201cYes akhi [brother], correct. I want to get my hands on a gun and how to make a bomb,\u201d he allegedly replied. The court heard he allegedly arranged to meet one of the officers at a local train station on 23 April and was watched by undercover police as he left his home and headed for the meeting spot.  Somewhere along the way the boy allegedly changed his mind, never showing up for the meeting with the covert officer.

He was arrested the following afternoon at 3.15pm near his home, police allegedly finding a handwritten note drawn up a week earlier that read \u201cI openly declare that anyone who does not accept the caliphate of Abu Bakr [al-Baghdadi, the Isis leader] is a kuffar\u201d and \u201cI openly call for sharia law to be established worldwide\u201d. The boy\u2019s lawyer, Zemarai Khatiz, has argued that multiple people had access to the phone used to hold the conversations.  He said in a hearing on Monday a psychological assessment had found his client had severe anxiety and depression, which would only be exacerbated by time in custody. The court heard that earlier assessments had revealed the boy, who since October had been taking part in an official deradicalisation program, had been traumatised by a police raid on his home in May 2015. \u201cI was at school, came home and saw my parents crying,\u201d he was alleged to have said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it happened and that I was in that situation. \u201cI would just stay home and I would cry in my bed. \u201c[I was] depressed, I was angry at myself\u2026 I ruined my life\u201d Since the raids the boy had left school and been working 12-hour days, for up to six days each week, as an apprentice.  His father believed he was succeeding in turning his life around, unaware of his son\u2019s alleged possession of Isis propaganda, including 11 copies of its glossy magazine Dabiq. Haskett said on Thursday the deradicalisation program \u201cseems to have failed with this applicant\u201d. The boy\u2019s family began sobbing in the courtroom as the bail refusal was read. The boy, who appeared via video link, put his head in his hands. Khatiz indicated the refusal would be appealed to the supreme court. A committal hearing is scheduled for 21 June.",
