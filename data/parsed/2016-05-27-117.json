Gladiator, Lawrence of Arabia, Black Hawk Down and part of Game of Thrones were all shot there, as well as countless films about Jesus\u2019s life, including Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Last Temptation of Christ. Far from relishing the fame however, some Moroccans have grown tired of their country being used as Hollywood\u2019s automatic stand-in for places as disparate as Somalia, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Macedonia and Tibet. They say it is orientalist and perpetuates age-old western stereotypes about the \u201cexotic east\u201d.  Amal Idrissi, a Moroccan professor, said that while watching the 2014 blockbuster American Sniper she was shocked to recognise Moroccan architecture in what was supposed to be Iraq.

It\u2019s a huge detail \u2013 it\u2019s not nothing. For me it\u2019s like earth and sky. For them, it\u2019s not important.\u201d   Related: Ben Rivers: \u2018You find abandoned sets from films like Lawrence of Arabia just standing there in the desert\u2019    Morocco is 3,000 miles from Iraq, but it has beautiful desert landscapes, mountains and sea, a far better security situation, the right kind of light for filming, and \u2013 particularly in Ouarzazate \u2013 many experienced extras. Most of these have cultivated professional beards, according to Karim Aitouna, the producer of Sans Bruit, a new documentary about Ouarzazate\u2019s extras. \u201cWhen they know a Hollywood film is coming, they grow beards,\u201d Aitouna said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very important criteria for the castings \u2013 for the historical films but also because they\u2019ll play in terrorist films. They all have beards all the time, not because they want it but because they\u2019re waiting for casting.\u201d Many extras think they know Hebrew, because in the Biblical films they are given a text and asked to mime speaking it in the background of a scene. \u201cBut it\u2019s not real Hebrew they\u2019re speaking, it\u2019s fake Hebrew,\u201d Aitouna said.

Photograph: Alamy    Because so many war films are shot there, amputees are highly sought-after, as is Malika, a 68-year-old woman who has been in more than 200 films since the 1970s because she can cry on demand. She can earn up to \u20ac80 (\u00a361) a day, double what an ordinary extra would get, for her wailing in the face of whatever disaster is being filmed that day.   Related: The Moroccans by Leila Alaoui \u2013 in pictures    Idrissi said it was distressing to see her country portrayed so often as a war zone, especially as few of the details are changed \u2013 for instance, extras are often wearing the distinctive Moroccan djellaba. Othman Naciri, another Moroccan filmmaker, said in an interview with PRI that Hollywood directors did not know very much about his country or compatriots, and chose to film there because it was cheap, safe, and had a lot of sand. \u201cThe Moroccan people are cast as typical Arab profile: terrorist, bad guys, according to the American point of view,\u201d Naciri said. \u201cYou know, we are not so far from the western point of view of the 1950s \u2013 with the good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d Sa\u00e2d Chra\u00efbi, one of Morocco\u2019s most acclaimed directors, pointed out other pitfalls of being Hollywood\u2019s go-to desert location. \u201cArtistically, it does not bring anything,\u201d he said. Although technicians could be trained and can get work on sets, he said: \u201cThis is a problem because it monopolises the vast majority of technicians, depriving Moroccans directors of them.\u201d   Ouarzazate locator   Chra\u00efbi added: \u201cIt\u2019s annoying to feel like a surrogate country. But it\u2019s a double-edged sword. On the other hand, it\u2019s interesting to be a land that welcomes projects that bring light on conflicts in Arab countries and the world.\u201d Morocco has escaped the civil wars of Syria and Iraq and was untouched by the Arab spring. But its security comes at a cost. Amnesty International has documented dozens of cases of alleged torture in recent years, and many critics of the authorities have been jailed.

But Nabil Ayouch, perhaps the country\u2019s most famous director, was shocked to find out that his prostitution drama, Much Loved, had been banned in Morocco last year for its \u201ccontempt for moral values and Moroccan women\u201d. Like Ayouch, producer Lamia Chraibi prefers to work on films exploring Moroccan themes. Although the big Hollywood productions are often nostalgic, she thinks they are important because they provide poor Moroccans with a stream of much-needed income. \u201cIt\u2019s not the modern Morocco, it\u2019s the idea they want to have,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s orientalism \u2013 the western way of seeing Morocco. They want to keep seeing Morocco as it was 60 years ago. But it\u2019s still OK \u2013 why not? It\u2019s like a studio. It\u2019s not bad, we\u2019re not offending our image. We know our country and we are very proud of the richness of the country and the landscape.\u201d     Ait-Ben-Haddou, in Ouarzazate province, is a striking example of the architecture of southern Morocco. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    Idrissi is proud too, but thinks that portraying so many of the world\u2019s wars in her country\u2019s dunes is damaging to Moroccan dignity, and might even dissuade tourists from visiting. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for Morocco. People will think it\u2019s like Falluja here, and Falluja is not Morocco,\u201d she said.",
