But in what has been a tumultuous few weeks for teachers, parents, pupils and politicians, with the education white paper\u2019s plans to force all schools to become academies, the backlash and U-turn that followed, plus a string of embarrassing blunders and protests around primary school testing, Young has some interesting and unexpected insights into education policy and practice that go beyond the small media storm he triggered last week.   Related: Free schools aren't empty, it's just bad press    We meet at one of his primary free schools on a wet morning \u2013 he has a heavy cold and is coughing. We sit in the interim headteacher\u2019s office, Young choosing his words carefully as he tries to unpick the flurry of coverage and comment that followed a recent profile in Schools Week. The interest focused on his regrets since embarking on his educational odyssey \u2013 the tone is almost apologetic and rather unexpected given his bumptious public profile. Young admits that at the beginning he hadn\u2019t grasped how difficult it was to bring about system-wide improvement, and how with the benefit of hindsight he would have been less critical of schools. In the reporting that followed, his comments were directly linked with his decision to step down as CEO at the end of this academic year. \u201cIn all the pieces that ran, the gist of it was that I had imagined that running schools was far easier than it had turned out to be and that\u2019s why I was stepping down as CEO.\u201d Indeed, in the Mirror it was \u201cToby Young admits \u2018running a school was harder than I thought\u2019 in extraordinary free schools climbdown\u201d, while the Times headlined the story, \u201cPoster boy of free schools quits\u201d.           Melissa Benn and Toby Young discuss whether free schools favour the middle classes \u2013 video (2013)    Young wants to make clear that though he is stepping down, there is no \u201cfree schools climbdown\u201d and he remains as passionately committed to free schools as ever. He\u2019s proud of the schools he has helped set up and would like to see the free school policy extended to other parts of the UK. But the West London Free School Academy Trust that he founded has become too big a job for a part-time CEO \u2013 Young does it in three days a week \u2013 and with plans to expand from four schools to up to 20 over the next decade, they need a full-time professional. His regrets are worth revisiting briefly, as they reveal the way in which the experience of setting up a free school has been an education for him. He talks about his naivety in thinking if you get the ethos and the curriculum of a school right, then everything else will fall into place. \u201cI had not realised at the time that\u2019s really just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he says. \u201cI had not grasped just how many different things you have to get right, just how many details you have to stay across, and just how easily things can go wrong.\u201d He\u2019s sorry he was dismissive about teacher workload and says he has a new-found respect for the profession. \u201cI\u00a0now realise that teaching is incredibly hard work and not something I could do myself,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cWe do expect them to do far too much.\u201d   Related: How the Tories picked free schools: chaotic, inconsistent and incompetent    Young also admits to being disappointed with the way the government\u2019s free schools policy is playing out. While parents were at the centre of the original free school vision, it has become progressively more difficult for parent groups to set up schools. In the last wave of openings announced by the government in February, only one out of 22 schools was being set up by parents. \u201cIt\u2019s still possible for parent groups to set up free schools,\u201d insists Young. \u201cI\u2019m in touch with a number of them. It\u2019s perhaps more difficult now than it was in 2010. The problem is that for parents\u2019 groups to successfully set up schools they need a tremendous amount of support. That\u2019s expensive. In the current financial climate it\u2019s very difficult for the Department for Education to justify spending a lot of money on putting various forms of support in place for parent groups.\u201d He\u2019s also cautious about David Cameron\u2019s promise of 500 additional free schools by the end of this parliament, describing it as \u201can ambitious target not just because setting up schools is really hard, but because finding suitable sites is really difficult, particularly in London\u201d. Young does not want to appear too critical of the government. He is supportive of the Sats regime, which has been widely criticised, particularly after papers were leaked online, and he has no sympathy with parents who took their children out of school in protest at the tests: \u201cI don\u2019t buy that children find them stressful. If a test is administered properly children should not find them stressful.\u201d His own son was sitting Sats last week. \u201cI was trying to get him to revise last night, he point-blank refused.\u201d He also plays down the government\u2019s U-turn over forced academisation. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much of a climbdown it is. There are still lots of mechanisms in place which will ensure that more and more schools convert to academy status.\u201d Later he describes it as \u201ca political miscalculation\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will get there anyway but we will perhaps not get there quite as quickly. They had not done enough tilling of the soil. It came as a bit of a shock to many backbench MPs.\u201d But it is on the \u201cenormous powers\u201d \u2013 his words \u2013 at the disposal of the education secretary that he is at his most interesting and critical. With the erosion of local authority responsibility for education, more power has been handed to Nicky Morgan and her department.   Related: A Toby Young U-turn on free schools? Don\u2019t believe the hype | Lola Okolosie    In the absence of an intermediate tier between schools and the DfE, Young proposes schools should have the right of appeal to the privy council over some decisions. His concern is focused on some imagined future education secretary under a Labour government, who will inherit these powers and might use them to claw back some of the freedoms his schools enjoy. But he says that schools today should have that same right of appeal. \u201cIf a school is being forced to close or if it is being forced to join a multi-academy trust it doesn\u2019t want to join \u2013\u00a0a\u00a0couple of free schools have been forced to close \u2013 it would have been nice for them to have a right of appeal to the privy council,\u201d he says. Although Young is stepping down as CEO he will remain involved at the schools he founded as a director. This year will see the first cohort sit their GCSEs and he is confident results will be well above the national average. Nevertheless, the past six years have been quite an education for him. \u201cIt\u2019s been easily the most difficult thing I\u2019ve tried to do in my life. I co-produced a Hollywood movie \u2013 I thought that was difficult. That was a walk in the park compared to setting up schools.\u201d",
