  "body": "The title comes from a rather obscure book, West Irish Folk-Tales and Romances, collected and edited by William Larminie, and published in 1893. He translated the stories told to him in Gaelic in the Western Isles. In one of them, \u201cThe King Who Had Twelve Sons\u201d, a young man who has married a princess finds a golden apple on the beach. In the next sentence it becomes a pearl of gold, and a druid tells him it belongs to the daughter of a king in the \u201cEastern world\u201d. The young man\u2019s pony then advises him of the journey he must undertake to find this other princess, one of whose obstacles is the seven miles of steel thistles. It\u2019s a confusing tale, with all the aleatory illogic of a dream, and as author Katherine Langrish takes us through it, she pauses to acknowledge our perplexity. At one point a hen-wife appears. A what? And where did it come from? \u201cOh well, I suppose every castle has one,\u201d Langrish says. But the salient point about this baffling story is that it suddenly breaks off, and Larminie writes: \u201cThe narrator\u2019s memory failed him at this point.\u201d He remembered the last line, but not how the story got there. This is important because, as Langrish says, \u201cFairy tales on the printed page are finished, unchanging, canonical, anonymous. Fairy tales told aloud are fuzzy-edged, fluid, variable \u2013 and belong to the person who is telling them, for so long as they are upon his or her tongue.\u201d Note the phrasing and tone of those last 11 words. Aren\u2019t they themselves like something from a fairytale, their italics giving them a sound of command, like the geasa, or magical prohibitions, which get so many heroes and heroines into trouble? C\u00fa Chulainn, we learn here, was placed under two: never to eat the flesh of a dog, and never to refuse a meal from a woman. So when a trio of witches offer him some roast dog, that\u2019s him done for. Langrish has been collecting fairytales for goodness knows how long, and her knowledge and frame of reference are phenomenal. Almost all those she cites here were new to me, however old they may be. One I did know was the story of Mr Fox, and as she went through its details they all came back to me: the command \u201cBe bold, be bold, but not too bold\u201d; the chopped-off hand with the ring on its finger falling into the hiding bride-to-be\u2019s lap; even down to the number of pieces her rescuing brothers cut Mr Fox into (a thousand). I have no idea when I first heard this story; it has the quality of timelessness. Langrish does not have theories. What she has done so brilliantly, either making general points or addressing specific stories or themes, is tell us stories about the stories: where they might have come from, what they might mean, or whether they are meant to mean anything. (Of faeryland, that \u201cother place\u201d which is neither the world, heaven, purgatory or hell, from where those we thought dead might, very rarely, be rescued, she says: \u201cThis is the fantasy of grief,\u201d and I have never heard a better explanation.) It is all spun out so seemingly artlessly, or naturally, that you feel as if you are sitting cross-legged, gripped, like a child hearing one of these stories for the first time. Yeats believed he had summoned the Queen of the Fairies; Langrish has her doubts about this. He reviewed Larminie\u2019s collection, though, and of the stories in it he said: \u201cThey and their like are the only things really immortal, for they are told in some shape or other, by old men at the fire before Nebuchadnezzar ate grass, and they will linger in some odd cranny or crevice of the world when the pyramids have crumbled into sand.\u201d This wonderful book is a map of those crannies and crevices. \u2022 Seven Miles of Steel Thistles is published by The Greystone Press (\u00a312.99).",
