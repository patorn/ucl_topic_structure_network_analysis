  "body": "Trump fights back The presumptive Republican candidate is fighting back after a weekend taking heat over his attitude toward women. In doing so, he picked a fight with the British prime minister, David Cameron, and new London mayor Sadiq Khan. The Guardian takes a look at the Trump universe. Trump also told British interviewer Piers Morgan that immigration to the UK as a result of European Union membership has been a disaster. \u201cIf I was from Britain I would want to go back to a different system,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with the European Union and it\u2019s very bureaucratic. Personally, in terms of Britain I would say, what do you need it for?\u201d  Under a Trump administration, he added, Britain would be treated \u201cfantastically\u201d. At home, Trump found new supporters in the Republican mainstream. Aides also dismissed the recent swirl of controversies over the non-disclosure of his tax returns and the impression that Trump moonlighted as his own publicist, \u201cJohn Miller\u201d, in the 1990s. GOP leaders: People don\u2019t care about Trump\u2019s woman problem Another month, another record for global temperatures Global temperatures have broken records for the seventh consecutive month, all but ensuring that 2016 will be the hottest year on record. Most worrying, though, is that April temperatures smashed the previous record by a record margin. Nasa says the global temperature of land and sea was 1.11C (33.99F) warmer last month than the average for the same month over 30 years after 1950. April breaks global temperature record, marking seven months of new highs China marks Cultural Revolution with silence Events to mark 50 years since Mao Zedong launched the war against the \u201cdictatorship of the bourgeoisie\u201d have been muzzled by Beijing, over fears any mention might damage Mao\u2019s reputation. \u201cThey think that if we expose the Cultural Revolution\u2019s dark side, people will doubt the political system,\u201d Wang Youqin, author of Victims of the Cultural Revolution, a three-decade investigation into Red Guard killings, told the Guardian. China marks 50 years since Cultural Revolution with silence Overworked, understaffed: Canadian PM\u2019s wife \u2018needs help\u2019 Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, wife of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, is facing criticism for saying she needs extra staff to expand her official role and take on more public duties. The former TV presenter said she answered official correspondence from her dining table. \u201cI\u2019d love to be everywhere but I can\u2019t,\u201d she told Le Soleil. \u201cI have three children and a husband who is prime minister. I need help. I need a team to help me serve the people.\u201d \u2018I need help\u2019: Sophie Trudeau\u2019s plea sparks anger in Canada Oil hits six-month high Crude prices are heading back towards $50 a barrel for the first time since November. The rise is spurred upwards by a Goldman Sachs report that found the oil market has dramatically rebalanced in recent weeks, due to declining production and a surge in demand. Goldman notes stronger vehicle sales and a bigger harvest are raising Indian and Russian demand forecasts for the year. Oil hits six-month high; Brexit would raise European risks \u2013 business live \u2018Queen of the Cartels\u2019 speaks out In her first interview in a decade, Sandra \u00c1vila Beltran tells the Guardian how two of her husbands were murdered and her brother tortured even as she ran a flotilla of tuna boats laden with 10 tons of cocaine each north from Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast to the US. The daughter of narco-royalty, she witnessed her first shootout at 13. \u201cAt dawn you heard the music,\u201d she says, \u201cthe shootouts, it was when they killed the people.\u201d \u00c1vila has spent the last seven years in prison for money laundering. Now free, she is lashing out at Mexican political corruption and drug prohibition, and admiring the escape, before his recapture, of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. Queen of Cartels: most famous female leader of Mexico\u2019s underworld speaks out Digital divide leaves Native Americans disconnected What happens when a region, or entire ethnic group, is left out of the digital revolution? The Guardian travelled to the Navajo nation in Arizona, to find there is often so little cellphone service that 911 callers cannot be traced directly to their cellphone\u2019s latitude and longitude. The Navajo are hoping that FirstNet, an authority set up by the US Department of Commerce to set up a data network, could help to change the picture. How a digital divide leaves parts of rural America isolated Sexual assault victims identify themselves in bid for justice As more women are throwing down the cloak of anonymity, experts point to unprecedented trend of going public. A misogynistic backlash, however, continues. \u2018Breaking the shackles of shame\u2019: the rape survivors leading a new wave of activism Obama: \u2018Ignorance is not a virtue\u2019 President Obama was at Rutgers University in New Jersey on Sunday to give graduating students an inspiring address meant as a sendoff into the post-college world. He hit his marks with ease, warning the class of 2016 that \u201cignorance is not a virtue\u201d and to resist anyone, from any side of the political spectrum, who seeks to shut down speech and discussion. We looked at some of the best commencement speeches \u2026 The best commencement speeches: from Jill Abramson to Neil Gaiman The Age of Aquarius? Nope. It\u2019s the Age of Anxiety  Forty million Americans have an anxiety disorder; the average age of onset is 11. The symptoms could be general \u2013 OCD \u2013 or specific, like Greenlanders with kayak anxiety. Anxiety, says Scott Stossel, the author of My Age of Anxiety, \u201chas become part of the cultural furniture\u201d. Here, four writers reveal how fear rules their lives:  \u2019Sick and asphyxiating\u2019 \u2013 why we live in an age of anxiety Tech wealth to provide income floor The 1970s idea of universal basic income (UBI) is making a comeback with pilot projects announced in Finland, the Netherlands and Canada. Behind its resurgence is the fear that AI technology is about to unleash a massive wave of job losses and with it a social crisis that only the implementation of a basic, universal income can prevent. A Silicon Valley-centric group of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, engineers and futurists are coming together to form an advocacy network for UBI.  Tech billionaires got rich off us. Now they want to feed us the crumbs Chinese dominate US real estate A new study suggests Chinese investors are now the largest foreign buyers of US property. A surge in investment, $110bn over the past five years, helped the real estate market recover from the crash that began in 2006 and precipitated the 2008 economic crisis. But the investment has also pushed real estate prices higher and there\u2019s no sign that cash inflows are slowing \u2013 Chinese investment could double. Chinese pour $110bn into US real estate, says study Woody Allen and Donald Trump take heat at Cannes The Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon has launched a new attack on Woody Allen. Sarandon told a discussion celebrating the 25th anniversary of Thelma and Louise that the director, who was investigated but never charged after he allegedly sexually assaulted his daughter, had \u201csexually assaulted a child and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right\u201d. Sarandon, a prominent Bernie Sanders supporter, then went after Donald Trump. \u201cThe thing interesting about Trump is the things he\u2019s talking about are impossible,\u201d she said.  Susan Sarandon blasts Woody Allen and Donald Trump at Cannes Hayne Plane takes off for Olympics \u2013 possibly Jarryd Hayne, the Australian rugby league star who played for the San Francisco 49ers last season, has left the NFL in search of a place at the Games in Rio with the Fiji rugby union sevens team. It may not be an easy path: the Fijians (from the land of Hayne\u2019s father) are the best in the world and only have 12 places available; Hayne has one HSBC Sevens World Series event in which to make his case; and the NFL\u2019s stand-off with world anti-doping bodies may throw a spanner in the works. It may be wiser to bet on the Patriots\u2019 Nate Ebner, currently with the USA sevens team. Jarryd Hayne retires from NFL to pursue Olympic rugby sevens dream with Fiji And another thing\u2026 Dean Karnazes\u2019 muscles never tire. He can run for three days and nights without stopping. His secret, apparently, is that he never reaches his lactate threshold \u2013 the burning sensation as your muscles begin to tire. David Cox writes that Karnazes has never experienced any form of muscle burn or cramp, even during runs exceeding 100 miles. That means his only limits are in the mind.
