Most recently, Ongar Academy in Essex launched a project to discourage students from using words like ain\u2019t, geezer, whatever, like, and literally. We\u2019ve been here before. Schools across the country have outlawed inoffensive words, with some asking parents to \u201ccorrect\u201d children at home. Slang, regionalisms, and colloquialisms are typical usages objected to, with occasional spelling errors thrown in as though somehow equivalent. The only thing uniting them is that they\u2019re not considered standard or sufficiently formal. Banning words is not a sound educational strategy. As Michael Rosen points out, schools have been trying this for more than 100 years to no avail. Research shows that gradual transition towards standard English works better. But because dialect prejudice is so prevalent, this must be done in such a way that children understand there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with their natural expression.    Because children are sensitive to how they\u2019re perceived, stigmatising their everyday speech can be harmful    Ongar Academy says it\u2019s not banning words, but \u201cevolving\u201d its pupils\u2019 speech \u2013 a description with classist implications. The head teacher, David Grant, says that students\u2019 dialect \u201cmay not favourably reflect on them when they attend college and job interviews\u201d. This may seem a reasonable position, when even those who work in education are subject to linguistic intolerance. But to assume that students who use slang \u2013 ie, most of them \u2013 will do so in interviews does them a disservice. Native speakers of English are generally at least bidialectal. We have the dialect we grew up using, with its idiosyncrasies of vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation, and we learn standard English at school and through media like books and radio. As with any social behaviour, we pick up linguistic norms and learn to code-switch according to context. Just as we may wear a T-shirt and slippers at home, but a suit and shoes at work, so we adjust our language to fit the situation.           Should schools ban slang from the classroom?    Standard English is a prestige dialect of huge social value. It\u2019s important that students learn it. But the common belief that nonstandard means substandard is not just false but damaging, because it fosters prejudice and hostility. Young people can be taught formal English, and understand its great cultural utility, without being led to believe there\u2019s something inferior or shameful about other varieties. Grant says that in Shakespeare\u2019s anniversary year, we should \u201censure the way the pupils talk gives a positive impression\u201d. But Shakespeare\u2019s plays abound in slang and informal language. \u201cGeezer\u201d appears in books by HG Wells, Graham Greene, and Anthony Burgess. Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Charles Dickens and Vladimir Nabokov used non-literal literally. Rather than spurning such words, we can teach students when and why they are used. Learning different Englishes gives us command of different domains, a skill we can then put to creative and appropriate use. Facility with slang is a real advantage in some jobs. James Sledd once wrote: \u201cTo use slang is to deny allegiance to the existing order \u2026 by refusing even the words which represent convention and signal status.\u201d That is, slang lends covert prestige \u2013 however anathema to those in authority who prefer teenagers not to be teenagers. It doesn\u2019t help Grant\u2019s cause that in a short radio interview, he put basically on the Bad List but used it himself several times.   Related: Children and language: Taalk propa? Hadaway wi ye | David Almond    Linguistic vetoes can be counterproductive pedagogically too. Sociolinguist Julia Snell argues that \u201cto learn and develop, children must participate actively in classroom discussion; they must think out loud, answer and ask questions\u201d. When the focus is on the forms of speech instead of its content, she writes, \u201cchildren may simply remain silent in order to avoid the shame of speaking \u2018incorrectly\u2019, and miss the interactions crucial to learning\u201d. In light of this I can\u2019t share Ongar Academy\u2019s satisfaction that its students are now policing each other\u2019s speech. People feel strongly about correctness in language, but this strength of feeling isn\u2019t always matched by knowledge and tolerance. And because children are sensitive to how they\u2019re perceived, stigmatising their everyday speech can be harmful. By educating them about linguistic diversity instead of proscribing it, we can empower students and deter misguided pedantry. There\u2019s nowt wrong with regional dialects, nothing broke ass about slang. They\u2019re part of our identities, connecting us to time, place, community, and self-image. They needn\u2019t be displaced by formal English \u2013 we can have both. As David Almond wrote, in a wonderful response to one school\u2019s linguistic crackdown: \u201cYe hav to knaa the words the world thinks is rite and ye have to knaa how to spel them rite an speek them rite \u2026 But ye neva hav to put the otha words away.\u201d",
