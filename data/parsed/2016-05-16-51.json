  "body": "The Australian authority leading the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has said there is a \u201cdecreasing possibility\u201d that the missing plane will be found.  More than 105,000 sq km of seafloor in the southern Indian Ocean has been searched as of 11 May, leaving a remaining search area of just 15,000 sq km. Martin Dolan, the head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), said there were still \u201cgood prospects\u201d of finding the plane on the seafloor yet to be searched, with 15,000 sq km about the equivalent of the greater Sydney area.   Related: MH370: two new aircraft fragments 'almost certainly' from missing aircraft    But he acknowledged the increasingly likely outcome that the plane will not be found. \u201cWhen we walked into this, the best advice we had from all experts is that it was highly probably but not certain the aircraft would be found in this area. We have to contemplate now the possibility that we will not find the aircraft.\u201d Dolan said, after two years of searching, that would mean \u201ca lot of very disappointed people\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve put their hearts and souls into something that we thought \u2013 and still think \u2013 has a high prospect of success. We\u2019re just now contemplating the alternative.\u201d It is a marked change in tone from Dolan, who considered it \u201cvery likely\u201d that the plane would be found as recently as March. The search for the plane will not be extended beyond the 120,000 sq km area, as agreed upon by the governments of Malaysia, Australia and China.  That is expected to be completed in the coming months, though wintry conditions were likely to slow progress for that final 15,000 sq km. Dolan\u2019s estimate was \u201cmid-year\u201d, but he said that may be out by a month or more as bad weather caused delays. Two fragments washed up on beaches in South Africa and Mauritius were all but confirmed to be from MH370 by the ATSB last week. A piece of engine cowling featuring a Rolls-Royce stencil, found in South Africa earlier this year, and another piece found in Mauritius eight days later were found to be \u201calmost certainly\u201d from the missing Boeing 777. A total of five pieces of debris from the Malaysian Airlines jet have now been discovered in various spots around the Indian Ocean since it vanished on 8 March 2014. Though Dolan said the locations at which they were found was consistent with the ATSB\u2019s drift modelling, it tried to avoid overstating their importance. \u201cPretty much any scenario of the aircraft colliding with the water you\u2019d expect to see those sorts of pieces coming off the aircraft.\u201d Regardless of whether or not the plane is found, the ATSB will produce a report assessing the execution and reliability of the search, as well as the basis on which the area was determined. That was the same of any search, said Dolan. \u201cIf you don\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for in the area that you\u2019ve assigned yourself, you review the other possibilities.\u201d The scenario that posits that there were no manual inputs to the plane at the end of its flight was still believed to be the most likely, he said. But if the wreck was not found in the search area, the ATSB would have to consider the two principal alternatives: the powered ditching of the plane, and an unpowered but controlled glide. Regardless of its outcome, Dolan said the US $133.3m operation \u2013 paid for by Australia and Malaysia, plus $14.8m in funding and equipment from China \u2013 would not have been wasted.
