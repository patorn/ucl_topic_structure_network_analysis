  "body": "Magic and Kiss FM owner Bauer has acquired radio group Orion Media in a deal which could potentially be worth more than \u00a340m. Bauer, which also owns some of the UK\u2019s best-selling magazines including Heat, Grazia and Bella, will pick up a portfolio of stations in the Midlands that includes Gem 106 and Free Radio. \u201cFree Radio and Gem are influential radio stations in one of the UK\u2019s fastest growing regions,\u201d said Paul Keenan, chief executive of Bauer Media. \u201cIt feels a very important part of the country in our city network of stations. I am excited about the growth prospects we see in economies of Birmingham and the West Midlands and Derby, Leicester and Nottingham in the East Midlands. We see these stations as complementary.\u201d The amount of the deal was not revealed but Orion thought to have sold for about \u00a340m. Orion\u2019s underlying profits \u2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation \u2013 were just \u00a31.91m in 2014, according to the company\u2019s most recent publicly available accounts. However, the business attracted a number of bidders and a high sale price because of the scarcity of valuable radio assets in the UK not already controlled by a major group.  \u201cWe are happy with the economics of the deal,\u201d said Keenan, who would not reveal the price paid. \u201cOrion is a really strongly rooted local ad platform and business. Its audience delivery is really strong and growth prospects look excellent. The fit with Bauer is fantastic.\u201d The deal could see Bauer, which already handles Orion\u2019s national radio advertising sales, face an investigation by competition regulators.

Absolute is essentially a national service; Orion is a significant local platform. From a competition standpoint, my view is there is no change in the competition landscape.\u201d  Orion Media was formed in 2009 by Phil Riley with backing from private equity group Lloyds Development Capital, which took a 49.9% stake. The station\u2019s management is set to benefit from the sale with Riley holding a 17% stake and Adrian Serle, the chief executive, owning 3%. The group reported revenues of \u00a315.7m and a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.06m in the year to 30 September 2014.  \u201cOrion has established market-leading status for audiences and revenues in each of its markets, something our teams should be immensely proud of,\u201d said Serle, who is expected to leave the business after a transition period with Bauer. \u201cWe are extremely confident that the business will continue to thrive under Bauer\u2019s ownership.\u201d Bauer has been on the acquisition trail since Capital-owner Global Radio, the biggest commercial radio group in the UK, won the \u00a370m bidding war for Smooth owner GMG Radio in 2012, then the third-biggest group in the UK.  Having been outbid, Bauer has looked to build scale by buying smaller players including paying \u00a322m for Absolute Radio and several million for digital radio station Planet Rock, both in 2013.",
