  "body": "Roy Hodgson takes his England side into their latest pre-Euro 2016 assignment with Eric Dier, increasingly seen as the midfield lynchpin, urging the team to start playing with a more streetwise mentality and wise up to the tactics other nations might try to use against them. Dier, who spent his adolescent years in Portugal and began his career at Sporting Lisbon, believes there is a risk that England might be at a disadvantage unless they go into the competition next month with \u201can intelligent edge\u201d and show they have learned from mistakes at previous tournaments. His comments mirror Wayne Rooney\u2019s observations after the World Cup when England\u2019s captain complained that the team lacked \u201cthat nastiness\u201d and spoke about their \u201chonesty\u201d as though it was a potential weakness. England\u2019s players felt after the tournament they should have protested more to the referee when the Uruguay captain, Diego God\u00edn, already booked for handball, deliberately impeded Daniel Sturridge but was not punished further.

Related: England pay penalty for Rooney's red    \u201cI grew up in Portugal where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as aggressive [as English football] but it\u2019s got more of an intelligent edge,\u201d Dier said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we have that in this tournament. There are a lot of European and international teams who have that intelligent edge, as much as an aggressive edge, in the things they do. We\u2019ve got to be like that, too. \u201cI don\u2019t mean they go round kicking people. But they\u2019re intelligent. They win fouls in clever places on the pitch, they keep possession, they know how to wind people up, they know how to agitate. We can\u2019t fall for that, but we can learn from it. \u2018Streetwise\u2019 is the perfect way to put it. European teams and nations are like that whereas I think the English are a bit too honest and hard-working at times. We need to be clever but we don\u2019t want to lose that English attitude, either.\u201d The danger, perhaps, is if England\u2019s players, trying to adopt a new mentality, take it too far. Dier was one of the main aggressors when Spurs played at Chelsea in the so-called \u201cBattle of the Bridge\u201d, the 2-2 draw that confirmed Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side would not catch Leicester City at the top of the table. Dier was fortunate not to be sent off in a match that led to Spurs being fined \u00a3225,000 whereas Dele Alli, his club and England team-mate, missed the game because he was serving a three-match suspension for violent conduct, having swung a low punch at West Bromwich\u2019s Claudio Yacob. \u201cOf course, there are always limits,\u201d Dier said. \u201cEveryone knows that and we don\u2019t want to see things [at Euro 2016] like we did in the Chelsea game so we are looking to be clever. By that, I\u2019m not saying to go round beating people up.\u201d The 22-year-old added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it [the aggression] was just me in the Chelsea game. I think, as a team, we wanted to show a different side to our game. Things boiled over at times but, at the same time, Tottenham are trying to get rid of a certain image and I think that helped. For a long time Tottenham have had an image which I don\u2019t think this group of players and this manager enjoy. Obviously we are trying to change that. It isn\u2019t easy and it is going to take time but that is our aim. \u201cIt was a very emotional game. Lots of things happened before the game that made it that way and we knew if we didn\u2019t win we would lose the title. It was emotional but I don\u2019t think we lost our heads and I don\u2019t think I lost my head, no.\u201d Dier, preparing for England\u2019s game against Australia at Sunderland on Friday, is in England\u2019s squad primarily as a deep-lying midfielder and revealed he had been studying Nemanja Matic\u2019s performances at Chelsea to learn how to perfect the role. However, it is Dier\u2019s background as a defender that helped convince England\u2019s management to take the risk of selecting only three centre-halves in the provisional 26-man squad. \u201cI\u2019m happy to play anywhere,\u201d Dier said. \u201cI\u2019ve played in defence many times and I wouldn\u2019t see that as a problem.\u201d",
