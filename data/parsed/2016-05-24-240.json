So the phrase \u201cThat\u2019s so Vetements\u201d can be heard as jingle-jangle commentary for absolutely anything (recently, from personal experience, it was a cheeseboard of misshapen cuts of cheddar). So it\u2019s no surprise that this most meme-able of labels \u2013whose internet presence peaked when DHL CEO Ken Allen wore its famed DHL T-shirt (many meta returns!) \u2013 has become Instagram selfie gold.  At last weekend\u2019s Vogue festival, co-founder Guram Gvasalia revealed that his brother Demna\u2019s inspiration was born of frustration at the constant delivery service jibber jabber in Vetements HQ (\u201cI think he got so tired with the DHL talk that he said \u2018Let\u2019s do a DHL T-shirt because we\u2019re like DHL employees already,\u2019\u201d he said). So it\u2019s with some irony that Vetements\u2019 internet presence is so intertwined with DHL\u2019s. Hashtaggers around the world have been posing with affiliated accruements of the delivery service (mainly the van, sometimes a mug) such that it has become A Thing. Some tips: if the subject has the same look as the street-cast Vetements models (the look: extras from a Larry Clark film, with homemade haircut), the selfie is all the better for it.",
