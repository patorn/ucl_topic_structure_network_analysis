  "body": "Ebola swarmed west Africa without heed for the traditional barriers and health systems that separate poor from rich. Instead the virus, which has a mortality rate of 50%, found a dangerous, common ground in urban centres from Liberia\u2019s coastal capital of Monrovia to Freetown in Sierra Leone. This was not an accident: these expanding cities\u2019 very nature encouraged a viral breakout. Packed streets left little space to bury the dead, whose bodies remained contagious to the touch. And while people lived in close quarters, they were settled in their own communities, making broad communication challenging. \u201cThe problem with cities is the opportunity for a virus like Ebola to spread to others is significant,\u201d says Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). \u201cWhat we learned is west Africans have very good access to transportation, which is good for the economics and development of the region, but bad for contact.\u201d By late 2014, eight months after Ebola broke out, MSF\u2019s two Monrovia health units were better able to contain the flow of patients. Circulating Ebola awareness remained essential, though, to controlling the virus\u2019s onslaught. This included the message that despite cultural customs, bodies should not be handled. \u201cThe community-based work is absolutely key because there is no treatment, there is no cure, and that means people have to stop and understand how it gets transmitted. The only way we could stop it is through community education, through using radio stations and community leaders and artisan songs,\u201d says Kassia Echavarri-Queen, an MSF project coordinator based in Monrovia during the outbreak.  There\u2019s a growing recognition that a new way of business is needed to approach crises such as Ebola in urban settings. Major international humanitarian responses are often not closely tied to local organisations and politicians that understand their communities\u2019 ongoing needs. Relief work is not designed to tackle the particular challenges of urban crises such as the ongoing settlement of Syrian refugees across Middle Eastern cities.

The Global Alliance for Urban Crises, which officially launches next week at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, is an ambitious attempt to re-envision humanitarian responses in cities. One of the alliance\u2019s first steps has been to rally approximately 25,000 experts \u2013 one fifth of whom specialise in urban affairs \u2013 to advise vulnerable cities in disaster preparedness and relief work. The international non-profit Canadem is coordinating this database of on-call advisers, who could be dispatched anytime starting next month.  \u201cAs international actors, what we are trying to say is: we need to be smarter,\u201d says Graham Saunders, head of shelters and settlements for the Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross Societies. \u201cLet\u2019s not just drop in after a disaster. Let\u2019s focus on what was there beforehand, and let\u2019s work with the right local people rather than duplicating their efforts.\u201d The alliance will also research more localised approaches to humanitarian crises in cities and advocate for new funding channels. The United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) and the European commission have both committed to backing the alliance\u2019s mission, and more governments are expected to pledge support during next week\u2019s summit.    It was quite visible how the response had been problematic and the negative impact this had on the cities in particular  Lucy Earle     In 2014, UN-coordinated humanitarian relief requests totalled US $19.5bn (\u00a313.3bn), roughly equivalent to 0.031% of the world\u2019s GDP. Only 56% of that target was reached \u2013 and just 0.2% of those funds was dispatched to local organisations. This year, funding to meet the needs of 87.6 million people in war-torn countries including Syria and Yemen could top $20bn. Wake-up call A reconsideration of humanitarian work dates back to early 2008, when it was first announced that more than half the world was now living in urban areas. But the debilitating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which killed more than 220,000, proved a \u201cwake-up call\u201d, according to Lucy Earle, a policy adviser for DfID\u2019s urban crises programme, who, along with Saunders, was involved in the alliance\u2019s foundation. \u201cIt was quite visible how the response had been problematic and the negative impact this had on the capital city, in particular,\u201d Earle says. Widespread damage to the Port-au-Prince infrastructure and the loss of some Haitian government officials, international aid and UN personnel complicated the immediate recovery efforts, which became prolonged and were widely criticised.  Also apparent was the lack of involvement of the municipal officials in the relief work, according to Ann Young Lee, now CEO of the Sean Penn-founded J/P Haitian Relief Organisation, but who worked for another non-profit during the earthquake response.     More than 3.5 million people were affected by the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Photograph: Jorge Saenz/AP    \u201cI was going to meetings and noticed that none of the mayors were present. One of the first meetings I went to, I brought five representatives from the badly hit towns and we were asked to leave the meeting,\u201d Young Lee recalls. \u201cI felt embarrassed for the entire international community.\u201d  A few years later in Monrovia, in the midst of the Ebola crisis, Filiep Decorte, the chief technical adviser for UN Habitat, was shocked to realise that no one was attempting to map the city and develop a detailed understanding of its demographics. The city remained merely a dot on the map. \u201cMy point is if the city was more organised, if we understood it, this [the Ebola outbreak] would not have happened on the same scale,\u201d says Decorte, who was also involved in the alliance\u2019s foundation. Identifying all the right local leaders in Monrovia, Freetown and Conakry in Guinea was key to effective messaging, says Justin Pendarvis, a public health adviser for USAid\u2019s disaster assistance response team, who worked across west Africa during the outbreak. \u201cThe cities were the epicentre for this outbreak and we had to go at a scale that was historically unprecedented,\u201d Pendarvis says. \u201cWe needed to engage with not just one leader but all of the traditional leaders. At times it was challenging to reach down and sort of work and engage around the system.\u201d Corruption and mismanagement With another three billion people expected to join the urban ranks by 2050, international humanitarian financing has not kept pace with this changing dynamic. The aid flows through international intermediaries \u2013 an approach which may reduce concerns of encountering corruption in some countries with poor track records, but which can also make it challenging to connect directly with people in need of help. \u201cWe know there are issues of corruption and mismanagement, so let\u2019s bring in humanitarian principles, let\u2019s bring in our practices we have elsewhere, and help these municipalities change, rather than pushing them to one side,\u201d says Saunders.

A group of specialists convened by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon have signalled in advance of the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) that the complicated international humanitarian funding system needs reform. Cash payments to the poor could be more impactful than food donations, and work overall should be more localised, they agree. The summit\u2019s overall impact, however, was called into question last week when M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (not a member of the new Global Alliance), pulled out, saying it \u201cno longer [has] any hope that the WHS will address the weaknesses in humanitarian action and emergency response, particularly in conflict areas or epidemic situations,\u201d according to a media release.  Even those involved in the alliance accept that progress may come gradually. \u201cWe are not hoping for big changes overnight,\u201d concedes Emilia Saiz, deputy secretary general of United Cities and Local Governments, a Barcelona-based global network of local government leaders supporting the initiative. \u201cBut what we are hoping is that the logic of intervention changes, so local governments become part of the first-response mechanism.\u201d Guardian Cities is a member of the Habitat III Journalism Project.
