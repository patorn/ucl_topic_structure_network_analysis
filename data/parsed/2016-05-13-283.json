At least that\u2019s the conclusion some have leapt to following reports the club have cancelled plans to give him a big farewell dinner, a montage of his best bits, an endless stream of \u201cbanter\u201d at his expense and a live band.   Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend    Should Terry stay at Chelsea, he could be joined by the Bayern Munich midfielder Mario G\u00f6tze, who has been told he has no future with the German champions. This news will come as something of a source of irritation to Liverpool, who had their hearts set on a cherubic 23-year-old who could change hands for as much as \u00a335m. The phrase \u201csensational double swoop\u201d is not one the Daily Star bandies about lightly, but they\u2019ve reached for the heavy rumour-related artillery in a bid to do Manchester United\u2019s imminent efforts to bring Real Madrid\u2019s central defender Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Sporting\u2019s midfielder Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio anything resembling justice. The pair would cost something in the region of \u00a375m. Manchester United are also interested in taking Toni Kroos off Real\u2019s hands, but will face competition from Manchester City in their efforts to lure the German to the Premier League. In other Manchester City-related tittle-tattle, the Mirror reports that this season\u2019s breakthrough striker Kelechi Iheanacho is after a new deal that would result in him trousering \u00a3150,000 per week, compared to the comparatively paltry \u00a315,000 on which he\u2019s being forced to scrape by at the moment. Informed speculation that Arsenal are to offer Ars\u00e8ne Wenger a two-year contract extension is likely to prompt fury among certain sections of the Emirates support, who will show their opposition to the idea by tutting audibly, shaking their heads and coyly holding up sheets of A4 on which they\u2019ve written \u201cCareful now\u201d. Presuming Wenger inks the deal, he\u2019ll retain the services of Mesut \u00d6zil, who is sitting behind a desk with pen poised while looking even more surprised than usual as he surveys the contract that will make him the club\u2019s first ever \u00a3200,000-per-week player. Elsewhere in north London, that acrid stench over White Hart Lane is the smell of \u00a360m burning a hole in Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s pocket. Having inked a new deal with the club, the Argentinian manager has been given a sizeable war chest with which to bolster his squad before next year\u2019s tilt at the Champions League. Half the amount could go on Marseille\u2019s striker Michy Batshuayi, although West Ham are also reported to be interested in the 22-year-old Belgian. And finally, Francesco Guidolin wants to make Leroy Fer\u2019s loan move from Queens Park Rangers to Swansea City permanent, having taken a shine to the Dutchman since arriving at the Liberty Stadium. \u201cLeroy has been a good surprise,\u201d said the Italian. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him before but he has helped the team in the last part of the season, he is a good player and it is possible he stays here.\u201d",
