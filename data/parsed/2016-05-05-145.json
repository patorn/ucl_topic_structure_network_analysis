  "body": "For politicians and commentators, \u201cheating versus eating\u201d has come to be an idiom for the austerity era. For Claire Matthews, a car showroom worker and mother of three, sitting in a friend\u2019s cold front room in Christmas 2012 was a spur to do something about it. \u201cShe was complaining about being cold,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Turn the heating on.\u2019 She said: \u2018Today\u2019s an eating day, not a heating day,\u201d the 43-year-old tells me. \u201cI could see the kids\u2019 breath.\u201d   Related: Benefit cuts can have a devastating effect on mental health \u2013 just ask Sharon | Frances Ryan    Matthews wanted to help her friend without embarrassing her, so she gave her a leftover seasonal hamper packed with food. \u201cThe family lived on that over Christmas,\u201d she says. After doing the same for another friend, Matthews was approached by parents from her children\u2019s school in Bournemouth \u2013 each of them struggling to afford food, clothes, rent, and heating. \u201cYou help one and then others ask, \u2018Where\u2019s the help?\u2019\u201d By the start of 2013, Matthews had set up Hope for Food, a small charity run entirely on donations for anyone in the area in need of \u201clife\u2019s basic essentials\u201d. Three years later, she has a team of 150 volunteers. Hope for Food runs three street kitchens a week for homeless people, in which food cooked in volunteers\u2019 houses is served in the car park of a church. They also provide clothes and bedding, and deliver food parcels to people\u2019s doors. Most families are informally referred by one of 20 primary and secondary schools: they are ordinary parents and children, living in a climate of benefits cuts, sanctions and poverty wages. \u201cWe help a lot of families with school uniforms,\u201d Matthews explains as we talk, on her lunch break. \u201cThere\u2019s secondhand sales, but if you\u2019ve got \u00a34 what will you buy: uniform or food for your kids?\u201d She tells me about a man she helped who hadn\u2019t been getting the right benefits for eight months. He was on a zero-hours contract, and his wages went on rent and paying for petrol to get his children to school. By the time he saw Matthews, the family hadn\u2019t had gas or electricity for two weeks.    You\u2019ve got a 10-month-old baby laying on a sheet because there\u2019s no room in the B&B for a cot. What\u2019s it coming to?    \u201cHe came to me in tears,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had the children with him, and when you\u2019ve got two children standing there \u2026 We gave them food then. Later, we gave them a fridge and furniture for the flat. All donated.\u201d Matthews\u2019s volunteer-run service has turned into what she calls the stopgap until the benefit system catches up. Social services now call Matthews for help, often for families living out of B&Bs or moving to a flat after being in temporary accommodation. \u201cThey say, \u2018Can you provide furniture?\u2019 We got a call about a family with four kids \u2013 one was a baby \u2013 who were living in a B&B with no cooking facilities. Just a kettle. They\u2019d been in one room for a year. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a 10-month-old baby laying on a sheet because there\u2019s no room in the B&B for a cot. What\u2019s it coming to?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. When you take the kids food, it\u2019s like Christmas. When you give them a decent toilet roll, even the kids are over the moon.\u201d This is what destitution looks like. More than 1 million people in the UK are so poor they can\u2019t afford to eat properly, keep clean or stay warm and dry, according to new research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF). What\u2019s emerging in austerity Britain is a new level of class inequality: not simply between the wealthy and the poor, but between people who have enough money to buy toilet rolls and cook a hot meal and people who don\u2019t. In a typical week last year, JRF found almost 200,000 households in the country had to turn to charity for food, clothes, shelter and toiletries. For some, the smallest things can now be luxury. In February this year, Matthews and the volunteers added another service to Hope for Food: a monthly \u201cfamily dinner\u201d in a local cafe in Bournemouth. Families living out of B&Bs or struggling to heat their home and eat a proper meal sit down for three courses with no charge. Each month, 40 people are treated at the cafe. \u201cThis lady with four kids said it was the first time they\u2019d been around a dinner table in over 18 months,\u201d Matthews tells me. \u201cThey\u2019d been in a refuge and then a B&B.\u201d Matthews\u2019s lunch break is over and she needs to get back to her day job. As she leaves, I ask if she\u2019s ever approached local government over the past three years. \u201cI\u2019ve asked the council for help, for funding, but \u2026 they say, \u2018There are people in the system and we\u2019ll get to them\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had a Conservative MP come down two years ago to one of the soup kitchens, shake my hand and say, \u2018What can we do?\u2019 We wrote to him and we didn\u2019t even get an acknowledgment letter.\u201d She pauses. \u201cSo we carry on raising our funds.\u201d",
