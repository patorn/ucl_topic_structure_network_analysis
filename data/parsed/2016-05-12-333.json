The film won multiple awards, of course, but Cave\u2019s warning could just as easily apply to their latest project: assembling a choir of 14 singer-songwriters to create a new installation performance of Dies Irae. You\u2019ll know Dies Irae \u2013 part of the Roman Catholic funeral mass \u2013 even if you\u2019ve never been to confession. A Latin hymn dating back to the 12th century (or seventh, depending on who you ask), it\u2019s musical shorthand for doom, its ominous trochees among the most quoted melodies in the classical canon. They also slip into countless film scores: Star Wars, The Lion King, It\u2019s a Wonderful Life and, most famously, the opening credits to The Shining, in which composer Wendy Carlos reworks Berlioz\u2019s Symphonie Fantastique to foreshadow Kubrick\u2019s hotel horror. This new rendition will be broadcast from 114 radio sets in the eerie 19th-century cellars of Bristol\u2019s Colston Hall. Some will project the disembodied voices of singers, others the static between stations and shows. If this sounds ambitious, remember it was Forsyth and Pollard who managed to persuade Cave into therapy and on to camera with Britain\u2019s leading psychoanalyst, all in the name of art. Surely they can wrangle the likes of Jarvis Cocker, Beth Orton and Matt Berninger from the National to record a few lines of Latin. No cameras this time.   Related: Artists Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth on their love/work relationship    \u201cWe\u2019ve always considered ourselves to be video artists,\u201d says Pollard at the duo\u2019s house-cum-studio in Bethnal Green, \u201cbut since we\u2019ve started making film and TV, more and more of our ideas have been sound-based.\u201d Their workspace is uncannily tidy: books categorised by subject, music alphabetically, current and future projects listed neatly on a whiteboard. A new adaptation of Neil Gaiman\u2019s Likely Stories \u2013 scored by Cocker \u2013 airs on Sky Arts later this month. \u201cWe seem to be getting satiated visually, but sonically it\u2019s hard to challenge yourself.\u201d Radio has crackled throughout the joint career of these two Goldsmiths graduates, who met at 21 and together made their name with an artful restaging of David Bowie\u2019s final Ziggy Stardust concert at the ICA in 1998. They\u2019ve since created Silent Sound for the Liverpool Biennial and roped in Kevin Eldon and various other standups for their Radio Mania show at the BFI. This new piece, Requiem for 114 Radios, is a love letter to Kubrick as much as to the dying days of FM \u2013 the film-maker became a focus as soon as they visited Bristol, says Forsyth. \u201cThe Colston cellars are so cinematic they feel like the start of a story. Something has happened here, or is about to happen; it\u2019s that lovely anticipation you get at the beginning of a great film.\u201d Born in the early 70s, Pollard and Forsyth grew up at a time when A Clockwork Orange was still banned, and recall Kubrick as a subversive force. This Dies Irae is a \u201cbastardisation\u201d, says Forsyth. \u201cDon\u2019t invite the Latin scholars,\u201d agrees Pollard, who delights in what she calls in \u201cour choir of dissidents \u2013 they\u2019re all trying to fuck the piece up in some way\u201d. And the 114 radios? Another Kubrick reference. The CRM 114 Discriminator was a fictional piece of radio kit in Dr Strangelove, and the number pops again in several of his films, from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Eyes Wide Shut.

Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex    \u201cWe\u2019ve been drawing walls of radios for years ,\u201d says Pollard. \u201cWe\u2019re not very arty artists; we really don\u2019t do the whole sketchbook thing.\u201d However, they did hoard one old notebook. In it was a drawing eerily similar to this work. Thanks to eBay, the couple have managed to collect all 114 radio sets \u2013 and some to spare. There\u2019s a Japanese one that lights up like a Christmas tree; another, labelled \u201cworking\u201d by its seller, is locked into a Christian rock station. And then there are the Grundigs. \u201cOh my god, the Grundigs!\u201d cries Pollard. \u201cThere\u2019s a City Boy, a Party Boy, a Yacht Boy \u2013 I think we might have a near-full set. We\u2019re not collecting 50s and 60s valve radios here; it\u2019s the radios of our childhood.\u201d Except without cassette decks. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want there to be any question about how you\u2019re hearing the audio. However invisible or intangible, the air needs to be thick with radio transmission.\u201d Tuning them is the challenge. \u201cTurn on three radios and it\u2019s all right,\u201d says Pollard. \u201cTurn on the fourth and there\u2019s immediate interference. So we\u2019re going to have to tune all 114 at the same time \u2013 madness, we\u2019ll need ear defenders, but it\u2019s the only way.\u201d Danger is the drug, the risk of things not quite coming together. \u201cThe feeling I love as an artist,\u201d Pollard goes on, \u201cis when someone dares you to do something. A bigger, better braver version of what you wanted to do anyway.\u201d \u2022 Requiem for 114 Radios plays at Colston Hall, Bristol at selected times between 13 May and 5 June as part of Bristol New Music. It also features in Daydreaming With Stanley Kubrick at Somerset House, London, from 30 June.",
