  "body": "Why do women still die in childbirth? It is partly a matter of healthcare provision in poorer countries and global policy, but it is also a matter of rights. Actor Emily Watson explains. Global leaders and campaigners are in Copenhagen this week to discuss how to transform rhetoric on women\u2019s rights into reality. The Women Deliver conference is focussing on how to achieve global goals on gender equality, sexual and reproductive health rights and maternal health. But it is taking place in the shadow of funding shortfalls for groups dedicated to this work, including the UN agency responsible for reducing maternal mortality rates, which faces a \u00a398m shortfall.

Boko Haram using loans to recruit members in face of crackdown Opinion By ignoring the threat of air pollution to global health, governments and NGOs are storing up a \u201chealth timebomb\u201d for the future, writes Guardian environment editor John Vidal. \u201cPeople in cities complain bitterly today but the full health tragedy will not be seen for many years. Because the effects of air pollution are chronic, or slow, they build up in the body and impact mostly on older people,\u201d he says.

What you said On Finish line far out of sight in Nigeria\u2019s race to beat corruption, Traveller wrote:  I think President Buhari is definitely moving in the right direction. But it will take decades to eradicate something that is so endemic and present at almost every facet of society. Sadly, as a Nigerian, I am not holding my breath because there are so many kingmakers that benefit from the corrupt status quo, removing them or going after them might even be destabilising to certain regions. What we can hope for is that PMB [Buhari] starts a trend that future generations will follow \u2013 and that over a generation, we can eradicate the cancer of corruption that is seriously stifling Nigeria\u2019s growth and monopolising wealth in the hands of the very corrupt few.  Highlight from the blogosphere Climate negotiations recommence in Bonn, Germany, this week with discussions on the next steps under the Paris agreement.
