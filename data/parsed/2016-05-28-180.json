  "body": "I am sitting in my office, reading an information sheet titled Understanding Flexible Sigmoidoscopy. Although I\u2019ve read it twice already, I keep skipping sections that I think won\u2019t appeal to me. I\u2019ve still managed to grasp its underlying message, which is: \u201cYou haven\u2019t had a camera up your arse until you\u2019ve had our camera up your arse.\u201d A week later, I find myself in a hospital examination room. A nurse explains the entire procedure in a manner that leaves me unable to skip the bits that don\u2019t appeal to me. \u201cHere are your dignity shorts,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave you to pop those on.\u201d Once I\u2019m alone, I examine the shorts carefully. It is not immediately apparent how they might confer, or even preserve, dignity. I send my wife a text that says, \u201cJust changing into my dignity shorts.\u201d Her reply says, simply, \u201cpic?\u201d Eventually I am escorted down the corridor to another room, where the nurse tells me to lie on my left side with my knees drawn up. \u201cLike a baby,\u201d he says. Once I\u2019m on the the table, another nurse adjusts the large ArseCam screen so that I have an unobstructed view. An hour later, I am home. \u201cHow was that?\u201d my wife asks. \u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re always quite conscious of the fact that, out of four people in the room, you\u2019re the only one with a camera up his arse.\u201d      On Sunday, my wife\u2019s sister and my niece come to lunch, bringing fresh asparagus from the country. My sister-in-law tells us a long story about hiring some kind of spiritualist, a self-proclaimed bringer of light, to banish a ghostly presence from an attic bedroom. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d my sister-in-law says, \u201cshe was quite overweight, and I had to lead her up all these winding stairs.\u201d \u201cYou imagine them being thin,\u201d I say, \u201cbut I guess that\u2019s a stereotype.\u201d \u201cWhen we get to the top, she\u2019s like, \u2018There\u2019s definitely something here \u2013 have you noticed the change in my breathing?\u2019. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yes, I have!\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018I think I need to sit down for a minute.\u2019\u201d \u201cHow much does she cost?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou pay what you think it\u2019s worth,\u201d my sister-in-law says. \u201cAnd what did you decide it was worth?\u201d my wife says. \u201cFifty,\u201d her sister says. \u201cYou paid sixty,\u201d my niece says. \u201cI did,\u201d my sister-in-law says. \u201cI paid sixty.\u201d Once, I would have felt an obligation to pour scorn on such a story, to mock the credulousness of the participants, to roll my eyes at the idea of confronting a ghost and, with help of two spirit guides, ushering it from the wardrobe into the light. But over the years I\u2019ve realised that this impulse springs not from a desire to defend rationality, but from an unattractive urge to spoil other people\u2019s fun. When conversation turns to the spirit realm, I mostly feel excluded, because I have nothing to contribute. Something occurs to me. \u201cSpeaking of bringing bright light to bear on a mysterious netherworld,\u201d I say, \u201cI, too, have been on a journey.\u201d \u201cOh, Christ,\u201d my wife says. \u201cHe\u2019s going to talk about his colon.\u201d \u201cIs he?\u201d my sister-in-law says. \u201cA world where all is silent,\u201d I say, \u201capart from the sharp tear of the velcro flap at the back of your dignity shorts.\u201d \u201cDo you want to see him in his dignity shorts?\u201d my wife says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a picture.\u201d \u201cImagine a dark corridor, full of twists and turns,\u201d I say. \u201cPotential malevolence lurking around every corner.\u201d \u201cBut everything\u2019s fine,\u201d my wife says. \u201cNot quite,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause it turns out they have an even bigger camera.\u201d",
