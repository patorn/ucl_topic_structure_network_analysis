He and his team of volunteer journalists worked from a makeshift studio painted with a mural depicting Paraguayan farmers, or campesinos, with their fists in the air, beneath a banner proclaiming \u201cpeace and justice!\u201d Then, in November, police raided Mandu\u2019ar\u00e3\u2019s studio. \u201cThey took everything,\u201d Aveiro says. His experience is part of a pattern of suppression across Paraguay, says Francisco Ben\u00edtez from Codehupy, an umbrella organisation of human rights groups. \u201cThis government is driving a process aimed at eradicating alternative voices of protest,\u201d he says, referring to the administration of President Horacio Cartes, who came to power in 2013 at the head of the Colorado party.  Carlos Goncalvez, director of the media pressure group DemInfo, explains why community radio stations are being targeted (pdf).   Related: Disappearing world: Paraguay's Ayoreo people fight devastating land sales | Toby Stirling Hill    \u201cCartes wants to shackle organisations that fight for the rural poor,\u201d he says. \u201cCommunity radios give marginalised rural citizens a voice. They inform them about their rights and the struggle for agrarian reform.\u201d This struggle centres on land ownership: according to a 2008 farming census, 80% of Paraguay is controlled by 1.6% of the population. A third of the rural population live in extreme poverty (pdf). Such inequity is a legacy of the 35-year dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner. Stroessner forged a close alliance with the Colorado party while dividing public land among the military and political elite. Roughly 10m hectares (25m acres) \u2013 25% of fertile land in Paraguay \u2013 were given away or sold at negligible prices. Stroessner was ousted in 1989 but the expansion of international agribusiness has suffocated subsequent attempts to reclaim land. Activists say the biggest culprit is soya. During the past decade, both the land covered by the crop and exports have doubled. Paraguay is now the fourth largest exporter of soya beans; its biggest market (pdf) is the EU. Approximately half of this land was previously occupied by smallholder farmers and indigenous groups. In the last decade, 900,000 people have migrated from the country to the city.     A campesino congress discussing the struggle for agrarian reform.    Arantxa Guerena, author of an Oxfam study (pdf) on soya in Paraguay, says displaced people live in extreme poverty.  \u201cIt\u2019s a process of expulsion,\u201d she explains. \u201cSmall farming communities are surrounded by soya plantations. Agrotoxins [toxic herbicides used in large-scale agriculture] destroy their crops and damage residents\u2019 health.\u201d Compounding the issue is the lack of state support for small-scale farmers.  \u201cThey\u2019re left destitute,\u201d says Guerena. \u201cIt\u2019s a political decision, driven by pressure from agribusiness to take control of the land.\u201d Others defend the benefits brought by soya. Luis Cubilla, an economist with the soy traders\u2019 association Capeco, argues that it \u201cbrings enormous flows of wealth into the countryside\u201d. As yet unconvinced by these economic benefits, some rural Paraguayans are determined to stay and resist. Filling the vacuum left by the state is a farmworkers\u2019 union, the national federation of campesinos (FNC). The general secretary, Marcial Gomez, says they\u2019ve reclaimed 270,000 hectares through occupations and mobilisations since 1989. But this land has come at a cost: 129 campesino leaders have been assassinated, and thousands of farmers imprisoned. The most violent clash occurred in 2012, and triggered the impeachment of a president. Fernando Lugo had been elected in 2008, leading a left-leaning coalition called Frente Guasu. It seemed a watershed moment for Paraguayan democracy: the first non-Colorado government in 61 years. But a dispute unfolded over land in the eastern district of Curuguaty. The area had been designated for redistribution to the region\u2019s landless farmers in 2004. But the firm Campus Morumbi claimed ownership. With redistribution held up in the courts, a group of 60 campesinos occupied the land. On 15 June 2012, police officers arrived to evict them. What happened next is the subject of tremendous controversy; 11 campesinos and six police were killed. A week later, the senate voted to impeach Lugo. Neighbouring countries condemned the process as a coup. The clashes cast a long legacy: in the capital, Asuncion, 14 campesinos are on trial for attempted murder. They face jail sentences of up to 30 years. No one has been indicted for the deaths of the occupiers. Human rights groups say there are discrepancies in the official version of events.     Within a year of the occupation, the Colorado party was back in power. The new government implemented a state of emergency in the north of Paraguay. The rationale was to eliminate an armed guerrilla group. But failure to subdue the guerrillas has raised suspicions about the government\u2019s true priorities. \u201cIt\u2019s been converted into a state instrument to repress any process of organisation by campesinos,\u201d says Codehupy\u2019s Ben\u00edtez. \u201cIt\u2019s produced torture, maltreatment and violence.\u201d     The Paraguayan campesino community of Arsenio V\u00e1zquez, on land that was won through occupation in 2004.    The national mechanism for the prevention of torture has expressed concern over abuses against campesinos. In his sermons, the vicar general of Concepci\u00f3n, Pablo C\u00e1ceres, has condemned \u201chorrendous crimes committed against innocent campesinos\u201d. For the FNC\u2019s Gomez, the surge in violence is a response to the progress made by his campesinos movement under Lugo. \u201cThey\u2019re seeding terror in our communities,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen Lugo was in power, the necessity for agrarian reform was discussed in parliament and acknowledged in mainstream politics. Now Cartes wants to kill this discussion.\u201d Meanwhile, as President Cartes buys up media organisations, Radio Mandu\u2019ar\u00e3 remains off the air. \u201cFor the humble people here, our radio provided the only information they had,\u201d says Aveiro, leaning on the mural outside his empty studio. \u201cAnd now they\u2019ve shut us down.\u201d",
