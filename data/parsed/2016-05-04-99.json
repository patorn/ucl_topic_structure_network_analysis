  "body": "Mylo Kaye, director of Dreamr, explains why Tom Britten should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:   I have been working with Tom for almost two years. His dedication to my company as a marketing assistant has meant he has been solely responsible for getting our company\u2019s name out there to the world.  He is super bright and is always committed to working beyond what\u2019s asked of him. I passionately believe without him, my company would be very different. I am so happy that I have the pleasure of working with him.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
