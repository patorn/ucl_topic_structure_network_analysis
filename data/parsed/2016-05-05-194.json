I was six years old, and went to visit a friend who had recently purchased one. I was so excited. But as I peered into the cage to touch its fluffy little head, I had a nasty surprise: it bit me. I can see why. To it, I must have appeared like a giant monster invading its home. But in that moment, as blood spilled from my finger, I realised the perils of owning one of these animals as a pet.   Related: Pets are just ticking clocks in cages | Darragh McManus    I should say now that I am a huge animal lover. When I was younger I wanted a home filled with pets, and begged my mum for everything from ferrets to goldfish. I even built my own snail hotel in the garden. I have always had cats, and am now the proud owner of a tortoise. However, hamsters are a big no-no because (other than being surprisingly aggressive) they are also impossible to look after. They never seem to last much longer than a few months, and always seem to die in horrible ways. I remember one friend whose hamster excreted a strange pus before passing away a few days later. What\u2019s more, every hamster I have ever encountered seems to hate being touched or played with. Whenever you go near them they run into the edges of the cage, hiding behind whatever they can. No matter how much you want to show them affection, they give nothing back, and even if you rear it from birth some breeds of hamsters (despite how cute they are) will never really want to be petted or cuddled. I cannot fathom parents giving hamsters to children as pets. They hate being played with during the day. And, just when it\u2019s time for your child to go to sleep, it\u2019s time for a hamster to wake up. Cue scratching sounds all night. Hamsters also require a gentle touch and are easily startled by sudden movement and loud noises. It\u2019s a big ask for children, who lack fine motor control and self-restraint, to look after them in the right way. I had one friend who used to constantly pick up and drop her hamsters, even once squeezing them through the cage bars to get them out \u2013 an image that still haunts me. Maybe they work for some people. But I cannot think of anything worse than owning an animal whose urine can corrode plastic (fact!). And don\u2019t even get me started on the smell. Heidi Stephens: \u2018It was perfectly normal to watch telly with a hamster trundling around like a tiny rodent Gladiator\u2019 Daytime napping, infinite fluffy cuteness and expandable cheeks for storing food \u2013 what\u2019s not to love about hamsters? I was given one for my eighth birthday, giftwrapped in a stern parental lecture that he was all mine to look after, and if I managed to keep it alive we might one day get a dog. I was an imaginative child, so I called him Hamm.     Princess Charlotte (Marvin the hamster not pictured). Photograph: Getty Images    It turned out that hamsters are pretty low-maintenance \u2013 Hamm required enough daily sunflower seeds, carrots and apples to stuff his cheeks to capacity, plenty of water and a weekly clean-out of his cage. This was a multilevel Rotastak maze of crawling tubes, exercise wheels and hidey holes, but Hamm quickly learned that he could push the sprung door open, so we popped a clothes peg on it to keep him safe. Each evening we would let Hamm pootle around the house in a clear plastic ball, occasionally nudging him out when he got wedged under the sideboard. Apparently hamster balls aren\u2019t recommended any more, but in the 80s it was perfectly normal to watch telly with a hamster trundling through the shagpile like a tiny rodent Gladiator. Hamsters only live for two or three years, so they\u2019re an excellent way to teach children about pet mortality. Alas, Hamm died peacefully in his sleep while I was away on a school trip, and Mum buried him in the garden. Of course I later found out that Mum had left the peg off his cage door and, while trying to mount an escape, Hamm managed to sever one of his back legs in the spring mechanism and had to be put down. Many important childhood lessons were learned that day \u2013 that Hamm was a brave and intrepid explorer who died a hero, and that my mum could absolutely not be trusted. Kate, we\u2019re watching you.",
