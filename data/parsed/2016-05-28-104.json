Crown Heights rapper Troy Ave has been charged with attempted murder for his role in a shooting at a TI concert in Manhattan on Wednesday night that left one person dead and three others injured, including the 30-year-old rapper, also known as Roland Collins.  The morning after the shooting at Irving Plaza, the NYPD commissioner, William Bratton, told the radio station WCBS-AM that rap lyrics, and the people who perform them, are responsible for violence in the industry. \u201cThe crazy world of these so-called rap artists basically celebrates the violence,\u201d Bratton said. \u201cUnfortunately, that violence sometimes manifests itself in their performances and that\u2019s exactly what happened last evening.\u201d Erik Nielson, an assistant professor at the University of Richmond who studies hip-hop, said Bratton\u2019s comments were \u201cantiquated\u201d. \u201cIt is really rooted in a pretty basic misunderstanding of the genre and it feels intended to place the blame on an artistic and cultural movement, rather than on systemic forces that, frankly, the NYPD has had a significant role in perpetuating,\u201d Nielson said. He added that the NYPD is part of a broader institutional structure that has disenfranchised communities of color in the city. The NYPD\u2019s stop-and-frisk program notoriously targeted communities of color, as did the \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing theory, pioneered by Bratton in his first run as NYPD commissioner from 1994 to 1996. There is also the department\u2019s involvement in the deaths of unarmed black men.  In the past, the police department has specifically targeted the hip-hop scene, which was born in the south Bronx in the 1970s. The NYPD ran a special hip-hop intelligence unit for several years in the late 1990s to the early 2000s to monitor crimes in the community. But the scholars and artists themselves contest the NYPD\u2019s assumption that rap is more dangerous than any other genre of music. \u201cGo ask emergency room doctors, which they think are more dangerous, rap or EDM concerts?\u201d Nielson said, referring to the drug deaths at electronic dance music festivals. \u201cThe answer will not be rap concerts.\u201d  In fact, Nielson said, hip-hop culture was an outlet for those communities disproportionately affected by poverty and violence.  \u201cIn the 1970s, New York was overrun with violent street gangs, no matter what politicians did, no matter what the police did, the gangs remained pervasive and endured,\u201d Nielson said. \u201cThen came hip-hop,\u201d which he said helped rescue community members. TI, the headliner for Wednesday night\u2019s show who didn\u2019t get to perform, emphasized the importance of rap music while offering his condolences on Instagram to the victim\u2019s family and those injured in the shooting. \u201cMy heart is heavy today,\u201d he said. \u201cOur music is intended to save lives, like it has mine and many others.\u201d The hip-hop squad The NYPD said Wednesday night\u2019s shooting began outside a green room sparked by a dispute. Ronald McPhatter, 33, was killed in the shooting and Collins was injured along with Christopher Vinson, 24, and Maggie Heckstall, 26. This is the sort of crime the NYPD\u2019s since-disbanded hip-hop intelligence unit would have been deployed for in the late 1990s and early 2000s, said the creator of the unit, Derrick Parker, a 20-year veteran of the NYPD. Parker said the NYPD\u2019s rap unit \u2013 known as the \u201chip-hop taskforce\u201d, \u201chip-hop squad\u201d and \u201crap intelligence unit\u201d \u2013 was formed in 1999, sparked by a rise in violence in the hip-hop community. Before the unit was made official, Parker was the NYPD\u2019s go-to for incidents that involved rap artists, like when Brooklyn-born rapper Notorious BIG was killed in Los Angeles in 1997. Questions have been raised about whether the hip-hop taskforce was guilty of profiling and unfairly surveilling communities of color, which Parker disputes. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as profiling, I think it\u2019s more or less, knowing a little about people who had violent tendencies in this community,\u201d Parker said. The NYPD, meanwhile, has never confirmed that the unit existed, though it said in 2004 that it had detectives who monitor the music industry after the Miami Herald reported that its police consulted the NYPD about rap violence.  Police would closely monitor those on the list when they made nightclub appearances or had concerts in the city, according to the Post\u2019s anonymously sourced report. \u201cThe other part of it is, there\u2019s a lot of really street-leaning gangster guys on the fringes of the industry \u2026 The police taskforce keeps tabs on who is around certain rappers and what movements they are going through,\u201d one source said. Parker said the rap surveillance unit has since been disbanded, though there are still officers monitoring shows and club nights. In 2014, the New York Post reported that the NYPD had a special watch-list of hip-hop artists including Drake, Chris Brown and Lil Wayne. The New York police department did not respond to multiple requests for comment. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to blame anyone else, but the management for Irving Plaza dropped the ball on this,\u201d said Parker, who now works as a security consultant. \u201cIt looks like they were not prepared to deal with this, especially with the magnitude of the rappers they had.\u201d Live Nation did not respond to a request for comment and Irving Plaza said it was referring all inquiries to the NYPD.  Despite the alleged lapses in security at the venue, Bratton lamented that it was \u201cthe backgrounds of some of these people, unfortunately the lifestyles they led or had\u201d that were more to blame. \u201cNo question a lot of talented artists, enjoy the music,\u201d Bratton said. \u201cMusic all too often celebrates violence, degradation of women and the drug culture. It\u2019s unfortunate that some of them, as they get fame and fortune, cannot get out of the life.\u201d Daryl McDaniels, the DMC of Run-DMC, told the New York Daily News that Bratton \u201cshould have known better\u201d than to pin the shooting on rap music. \u201cViolence is everywhere,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cIt existed long before rappers started portraying it in their music.\u201d McDaniels added that some artists need to take responsibility for violence in the community. McDaniels\u2019s friend and fellow Run DMC member, Jason Mizell, also known as DJ Jam Master Jay, was shot and killed at a Queens music studio in 2002. The NYPD has not solved the murder. \u201cWhen we see the violence in our community, we\u2019ve got to keep saying it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s wrong,\u201d McDaniels said.",
