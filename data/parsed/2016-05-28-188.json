  "body": "One Spanish journalist and two local correspondents missing in a lawless region of Colombia have been freed by the country\u2019s second-largest rebel group.  \u201cThank you to everyone who prayed for me,\u201d Salud Hernandez, a long-time correspondent for Spain\u2019s El Mundo newspaper, said late on Friday in her first comment upon being freed. Rebels identifying themselves as members of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, handed her over to a delegation led by Catholic priests in the volatile Catatumbo region.  Hours later, two other journalists from Colombian network RCN, Diego D\u2019Pablo and Carlos Melo, were also freed by the rebels. They had been covering the search for the Spanish journalist. Hern\u00e1ndez, correspondent for the Spanish newspaper El Mundo went missing last weekend while on assignment in the remote region near the border with Venezuela.  The ELN, which has an estimated 1,200 fighters, said on Tuesday in a tweet that it would not make any statements about Hern\u00e1ndez until it received its weekly reports from its units.  The ELN announced in March that it would begin formal peace talks with the government, as the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia inches toward a final deal to end its own half-century of conflict. Both the ELN and the Farc have used kidnapping as a means of financing, and of applying political pressure on the government, using high-profile hostages as bargaining chips. Before starting peace talks the Farc unilaterally renounced kidnapping, although many of its hostages remain missing. In an unusual message, the Farc\u2019s top leader, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, better known as Timochenko, on Friday chastised the ELN for holding the journalists. \u201cToday it\u2019s Salud Hern\u00e1ndez, tomorrow it could be any Colombian. Those practices must end for ever in Colombia. Peace demands her freedom,\u201d he tweeted.  President Juan Manuel Santos has said the talks will not begin until the ELN releases al its hostages but the group has rejected the government\u2019s conditions and has continued kidnapping civilians. \u201cWe are not willing to accept impositions,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Nicol\u00e1s Bautista, known as Gabino, said in a recent interview that aired days before Hern\u00e1ndez went missing. \u201cIn a country that today is moving toward a stable and enduring peace, it\u2019s unacceptable that these attacks against society continue to take place,\u201d Frank Pearl, the chief government negotiator for the peace process with the ELN, said in a statement.",
