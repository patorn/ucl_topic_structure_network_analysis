  "body": "Island Home is Tim Winton\u2019s insightful and vibrant testament to what it is to be a non-indigenous Australian living in the late 20th and early 21st\u00a0centuries. Less than 3% of Australia\u2019s population can trace their ancestry in the country to a time that predates photography. Despite up to 60,000 years of continuous human habitation, it is still the landscape that leaves the strongest impression. Australia is \u201ca place where there is more landscape than culture\u2026 Everything we do... is still overborne and underwritten by the seething tumult of nature\u201d.   Related: Interview: Tim Winton    The book is in part a love song to Australia and also an attempt to trace how this love affair began, as well as where it might go next. The structure is episodic and non-linear with some chapters only a page or two in length, and yet each one works as a stand-alone piece. I was reminded of handling a deck of cards, the apparently random juxtaposition of memories \u2013 in terms of time \u2013 as seemingly arbitrarily arranged as a shuffled pack. The book progresses thematically, not sequentially. Edmund White said \u201cyou have to tell the truth when you\u2019re\u00a0writing what purports to be a memoir\u201d, and Winton conveys a searing sense of honesty. His story begins halfway around the world, in 1988, in Ireland, as he runs with his young son through freezing, slanting hail. Later, warmed by hot chocolate, his son looks at photographs of \u201cthe sun-creased faces of friends and family. Daggy hats and bare chests. Dogs in utes\u201d, and asks: \u201cIs it real?\u201d Thus Winton begins the extrication of his family from Europe, from the travel that Australians are so very good at, in search of home.    I was formed by gaps, nurtured in the pauses between people. And over it all an impossibly open sky, dwarfing everything    Few people come to Australia looking for \u201cthe built glories of our culture\u201d, he observes. \u201cSpace was my primary inheritance. I was formed by gaps, nurtured in the long pauses between people\u2026 For each mechanical noise, five natural sounds; for every built structure a landform twice as large and 20 times as complex. And over it all, an impossibly open sky, dwarfing everything.\u201d And yet Australia is vulnerable, despite its size, and Winton\u2019s central message is tub-thumpingly political. When Winton grew up in the 1970s, \u201cAustralians were devoted uncritically to the conquest and mastery of nature\u201d. He traces this legacy from the attitudes of the earliest settlers who left their \u201crevulsion and dismay\u201d preserved in place names (Useless Loop, Lake Disappointment) through to the fortunes quickly made through gold, wool, wheat and iron ore. By the 1940s non-indigenous Australians were impassioned enough to go off to war and fight for their home. But the plundering of natural resources was having a discernible effect on the land. Winton recalls swimming as a boy in \u201ca shoal of salmon beneath a halo of diving birds\u201d, noting that it was \u201chard for even the most dull-witted boy to ignore the inkling that you\u2019re a small part of a larger process\u201d. But by the 1990s, \u201cwherever I swam in a mask and snorkel, I was seeing more and more of less and less\u201d. Recognition that the natural world has intrinsic value was learned in part from indigenous Australians, \u201cwhose pride in the wisdom of their own cultures and whose reverence for the country endured\u201d, and in part from the \u201cpoets, songsters and nature mystics, bushwalkers, birdwatchers and enlightened farmers\u201d for whom the land is primarily a source of wonder. Winton attributes his own awakening to the writer and documentary-maker Vincent Serventy. Today, it is Winton himself who is one of Australia\u2019s strongest advocates for the environment. Island Home is a delight to read and a reminder that Australia and the UK are separated by distance and seasons \u2013 not to mention our common language: Winton\u2019s words chink like loose change, a foreign currency, mysterious. But more than anything, the book is a call to arms, a manifesto. It beseeches us to revere the land that sustains us, crying out to us for help.
