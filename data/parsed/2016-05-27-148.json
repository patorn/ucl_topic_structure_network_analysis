He\u2019s informing me that reviewers won\u2019t be given advance copies of the new album.  The artist he\u2019s working with isn\u2019t, by any stretch of the imagination, a globe-straddling megastar of the Beyonc\u00e9 or Adele variety. She\u2019s never had a hit single, her albums scrape the lower reaches of the charts. You\u2019d describe her as critically acclaimed, but even she\u2019s decided not to bother courting the attention of critics. But, the PR assures me, \u201cI\u2019m working really hard to try and get you a stream on the day of release.\u201d Why? I ask. What\u2019s the point? I\u2019ll be able to listen via the usual digital streaming services, as will everybody else on the planet.  You can pinpoint the moment when artists decided that critics were expendable to the release of Radiohead\u2019s seventh album In Rainbows in 2007. Up to that point, artists and critics were locked in a symbiotic, if sometimes strained, relationship. Albums were occasionally released without advance copies, but the excuse was always that this was to combat piracy.  Frontman Thom Yorke, on the other hand, happily admitted that the reason Radiohead weren\u2019t doing it was because he didn\u2019t want the album reviewed in advance, or as he called it, \u201call that bollocks\u201d. \u201cWhoever gets their opinion in first has all that power \u2026 it just seems wildly unfair,\u201d he said. That turned out to be a far more influential idea than the \u201cpay what you feel\u201d approach to In Rainbows\u2019 pricing. No one\u2019s tried the latter since, Radiohead included, but this year, virtually no big album release has bothered with advance copies. From Rihanna\u2019s Anti to Radiohead\u2019s A Moon-Shaped Pool, by way of Kanye West\u2019s Life Of Pablo, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, Skepta\u2019s Konnichiwa and Drake\u2019s Views, critics have heard them at the same time as fans.    If I was an artist, I\u2019d probably \u200bwouldn\u2019t do it either    I\u2019d be genuinely astonished if that didn\u2019t become the norm within a few years. Much as I would prefer to have weeks to prepare a review \u2013 listening to an album over and over until I feel I know its strengths and flaws inside out, writing notes, polishing lines, not having to have conversations with PRs about whether or not getting your own personal stream on the day counts as preferential treatment for which you should display unending thankfulness \u2013 I find I can\u2019t begrudge artists not doing it.  If I was an artist, I\u2019d probably wouldn\u2019t do it either. It\u2019s a win-win. If the reviews that appear in the hours after the release are positive, then they add to the sense of occasion and excitement. If they\u2019re negative, then they can now be more easily dismissed: how can anyone possibly form a meaningful opinion in such little time?  Yet the weird thing is that people still seem to care about reviews, even ones written at short notice \u2013 at least if the number of page views and shares of the stuff I\u2019ve had to write in those circumstances are anything to go by. It\u2019s required a fairly serious overhaul of the way I work. You can actually do some preparation. As soon as you hear the rumour someone is about to stealthily release an album \u2013 there\u2019s always a rumour \u2013 you can think around it; about the artist\u2019s recent career, the role they play within the scene. You can reacquaint yourself with their back catalogue: mull over the themes that run through their work, the ideas they\u2019ve abandoned, those they\u2019ve stuck with.  None of this seems to quell the five minutes of mad, sweaty panic that descends the moment an album is released, during which I\u2019m temporarily gripped by the absolute certainty that I\u2019m not going to be able to write anything at all in the time allotted.      \u2018We\u2019ve all formed an initial opinion about an album then changed our mind\u2019    You have the opportunity to play the album once or twice, listening intently, taking notes: lyrics that catch your ear, music that recalls something in their past oeuvre or the work of another artist, how what\u2019s there fits the wider perception of whoever made it, how it chimes with, or jibes against, current trends. People will say that two listenings aren\u2019t enough to make up your mind definitively about an album, and they have a point. It\u2019s enough to form an opinion, but we\u2019ve all formed an opinion about an album then changed our mind. But I\u2019m not sure that people are looking for a review to be a definitive evaluation of an album\u2019s worth any more. They want something engaging and thought provoking to read while they\u2019re listening for the first time. They want something that functions, to paraphrase the writer Anthony Lane, like the opening line of an argument. Were readers ever really looking for a review to offer a definitive evaluation of an album? I\u2019ve long thought that artists tend to overestimate critics\u2019 power: if everyone cared so much about our opinions, the charts would look exactly like the critics\u2019 end of year lists, which they clearly don\u2019t.  A number of artists who enjoy hugely lucrative careers would long ago have been forced to go back to civvy street and there would be no need for the phrase \u201ccritically acclaimed\u201d with its implication of commercial failure. Perhaps the rise of the stealth release album hasn\u2019t changed things so much after all.",
