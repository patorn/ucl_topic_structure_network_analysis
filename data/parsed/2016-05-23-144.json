Joke\u2019s on you Batman!\u201d Now a guide on the Warner Bros studio tour in Hollywood has apparently confirmed the demise of the caped crusader\u2019s sidekick \u2013 Jason Todd version \u2013 at the hands of the clown prince of Gotham.

The Jason Todd Robin suit,\u201d the tour guide explains in a video posted on the studio tour\u2019s Facebook page, which has now been removed. \u201cSpray painted on the front \u2018Ha ha! The joke\u2019s on you Batman.\u2019 Those of you that know the storyline, know what happened to this Robin.\u201d    \u201cTwenty years in Gotham, how many good guys are left?\u201d #BatmanvSuperman pic.twitter.com/3jyC9j48gS\u2014 Batman v Superman (@BatmanvSuperman) April 27, 2016    Fans have long noted that Batman v Superman appeared to adopt the events of the controversial graphic novel A Death in the Family, in which the second Robin (Jason Todd) was killed off following a readers\u2019 poll. It seems likely Todd\u2019s death, or its aftermath, was featured in Zack Snyder\u2019s film to help explain why the new Batman has \u2013 in the words of Jeremy Irons\u2019 Alfred Pennyworth \u2013 \u201cturned cruel\u201d. The Todd revelation also feeds into rumours about the storyline for Affleck\u2019s forthcoming solo Batman movie, which the actor and film-maker is reported to be directing himself. Affleck is said to be using a story arc from Under the Hood in which Todd returns from the dead after being resurrected in one of Batman villain Ra\u2019s al Ghul\u2019s Lazarus Pits. He heads back to Gotham as a vigilante known as the Red Hood, whose violent methods bring him into contact with the dark knight. There is also a part to play for the Joker in Under the Hood. JoBlo and Latino Review have reported that the storyline will be told in Affleck\u2019s solo outing.",
