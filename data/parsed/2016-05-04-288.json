In a newspaper article, Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said the crisis engulfing Labour had \u201clifted the lid\u201d on bigotry, and warned that the party\u2019s inquiry into antisemitism must be more than a \u201csticking plaster\u201d or it would simply worsen the problem.   Related: Labour's antisemitism review must be more than 'political posturing', says chief rabbi - Politics live    He also hit back at those who argue that it is legitimate to criticise Zionism, arguing that the right to Jewish self-determination has been at the centre of the faith for more than 3,000 years.\u201cIt is astonishing to see figures on the hard left of the British political spectrum presuming to define the relationship between Judaism and Zionism despite themselves being neither Jews nor Zionists,\u201d he writes in the Telegraph. \u201cThe likes of Ken Livingstone and [NUS president] Malia Boattia claim that Zionism is separate from Judaism as a faith; that is purely political; that is expansionist, colonialist and imperialist.\u201d The strongly worded intervention comes after Corbyn\u2019s party was plunged into crisis after controversial comments by the MP Naz Shah, and Livingstone, led to the pair being suspended. It later emerged that another 16 members had been similarly punished for comments. Corbyn denied there was a big problem in the party, but set up an inquiry headed up by former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti into antisemitism and other forms of racism. That comes on top of an investigation by Labour peer Jan Royall into allegations of harassment and intimidation of Jewish students at Oxford\u2019s student Labour club.  Reports suggest that some of Corbyn\u2019s closest allies are frustrated that the row might shut down what they consider to be legitimate criticism of the state of Israel. Mirvis said he was disheartened to hear allies of Corbyn describe the attacks on antisemitism as a \u201csmear\u201d or \u201cmood music\u201d by political opponents of the Labour leader. \u201cThe worst of mistakes, in trying to address this problem, would be to treat it as a political attack which requires a political solution,\u201d he wrote.  \u201cIf this inquiry turns out to be no more than a sticking plaster, designed to placate and diffuse until after the elections this week, the problem will surely get worse and not better. Jeremy Corbyn has stated that his party \u2018will not tolerate antisemitism in any form,\u2019 and I very much hope that this inquiry will deliver on that pledge and be followed by decisive action.\u201d He said all political parties had a responsibility to stamp out such racism, but warned that \u201cpolitical posturing or empty promises\u201d would not be enough.  \u201cThe last 10 days have lifted the lid on a challenging issue, but if anything, I feel optimistic about the way that this problem has been received,\u201d added Mirvis, saying the world had to tackle bigotry.",
