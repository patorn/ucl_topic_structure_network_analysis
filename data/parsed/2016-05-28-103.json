  "body": "The voice on the other end of the line, doing what they call \u201cintake\u201d, had one last question. \u201cDo you have a preference in terms of the gender of your therapist?\u201d I paused, a little thrown by the question. I was just mechanically following friends\u2019 advice to seek help and take advantage of free therapy sessions provided by our graduate school; the idea of having a choice had not crossed my mind. \u201cNo,\u201d I replied, trying to avoid unnecessary fussiness. My therapist turned out to be a man, and he was brilliant. Through our sessions, I realized that his most important attributes were extreme perceptiveness and intelligence, as well as progressive politics (the books in his office made his interests clear). Without those, I realize, I would not have been able to feel comfortable enough to open up. What makes for a good fit when it comes to finding a therapist? Does a therapist have to be a certain way, or have lived through specific things, to \u201cget it\u201d? Do they need to mirror us? Dior Vargas, a 28-year-old Latina mental health activist, recalls a therapist in college \u2013 her second one \u2013 who she stopped going to after realizing she was \u201cculturally incompetent\u201d. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t aware of how close-knit Latino families are. That they are a part of my decision-making process. My therapist didn\u2019t understand that, she would say: \u2018No, you need to stand up to your mother.\u2019 That felt very disrespectful to me. Maybe sometimes you do, but the way she said it made me very defensive.\u201d Vargas\u2019s two positive experiences were with therapists with whom she felt she shared a piece of identity: one with a woman with the same Ecuadorian background as her, and another with a woman who was openly gay. \u201cI identify as queer. I felt like I could trust her,\u201d she says. When it comes to making therapy less monochrome a practice, Vargas says the problem does not just come from a preconception that only white people seek therapy, the problem also comes from the fact that therapists themselves tend to be overwhelmingly white. \u201cThe more diverse the workforce is in order to mirror the people they are working with, the easier it will be. I think it\u2019s important to get what the lived experience of being an \u2018other\u2019 actually is like.\u201d Randolph Scott-McLaughlin II, 29, who is himself a PhD student in clinical psychology, agrees there is a dearth of suitably diverse therapists to match clients\u2019 needs. \u201cI don\u2019t typically have an option in terms of who I pick. It\u2019s kind of, this is who I was referred to and then I see whether I can go with it,\u201d he says. Ideally he would like to have a black male therapist from an upper-class background from New York City \u2013 an identity that mirrors his. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard \u2013 almost impossible \u2013 to find that. But if I had a choice, that\u2019s who I would pick.\u201d In college, while experiencing racism in a way he had never been exposed to before, through intentional and extensive search aided by family and friends, Scott-McLaughlin did manage to find an African American male therapist. It was his best experience yet, he says \u2013 and crucially one that influenced him to pursue a career in the field. \u201cIt felt like he understood the context that I was coming to him in. It informed the way he handled me as a case. He didn\u2019t pathologize me,\u201d he says. The fact that his therapist could share experiences of racism in predominantly white spaces with him was validating. In other situations, with therapists who lack the same background, Scott-McLaughlin says he has felt \u201cput in a box that doesn\u2019t fit\u201d: instead of being listened to, assumptions have been made. With one white female therapist, he says he felt his gender and race made her treat him like a threat that needed to be controlled. \u201cShe shut me down when I expressed anger. The response was you need to stop your anger, as opposed to \u201clet\u2019s work with that and figure out why you are angry,\u201d which would have been a healthier therapeutic response, he says.  Scott-McLaughlin says he has been approached by acquaintances who are black and male who have expressed a wish to work with him once he has finished his training. These are men who would probably not seek therapy with someone who was not black and male, he says. But mirroring is not the necessary solution to encourage a more diverse and satisfied population in therapy. Ayorkor Goba, a clinical psychologist, says that the question of feeling like your therapist \u201cgets it\u201d is one that speaks more to the larger issue and need for cultural competence. \u201cJust because a therapist looks like you doesn\u2019t mean that they will be competent,\u201d Goba says. Studies have shown that matching therapists and clients based on race and identity does not always lead to better therapy, she adds. What does cultural competence look like in practice? Learning about different cultures and religions, being mindful of verbal and non-verbal interactions, and checking yourself for your own stigma, Goba explains. Being humble is also key. Even if there are similarities, there will undoubtedly be differences too, she warns. In some instances, Goba says, it is imperative to match therapists with clients correctly. This might be the case with female survivors of domestic abuse, for instance, where having a male therapist could be \u201cretriggering\u201d. Not all therapy-seekers have minded an identity mismatch. Adela Brito, a 27-year-old special education teacher, says that the therapist she worked with for four years as a young woman appeared to have little in common with her background \u2013 he was middle-aged, male and white \u2013 but that was fine by her.  \u201cHe kind of had that Full House, Danny Tanner look. He looked like that suburban dad that you see on TV.\u201d   Related: The day my therapist killed himself: shock, tears and then came a revelation    Brito, who identifies as Latina and entered therapy after attempting suicide and being diagnosed with depression, says that what she needed was to be listened to, and not feel judged \u2013 a feeling previous therapists she had briefly tried (also male and white) had not given her. \u201cWith him, I could be raw. He had a very opening space. He didn\u2019t force anything on me. He was empathetic with my family \u2013 my mom and our situation, the fact that she didn\u2019t speak English.\u201d \u201cHe gave me a lot of coping mechanisms, he was able to explain things without making me feeling dumb.\u201d While Brito was in therapy she was juggling an outside life on a full scholarship at a predominantly white college where she felt pressure to not fail a single class and be unfailingly articulate. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a minority in a majority white school, you have this weight on your shoulders, like I was representing the Latino community. That\u2019s not the way it should be, but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d \u201cAny little slip-up and it\u2019s like there goes the brown girl,\u201d she says. During a therapy session there was never such a burden. Qusai Hammouri, a 38-year-old Jordanian spine surgeon and artist based in the US, says that when he first sought therapy, he was looking for someone who was unlike him. He wanted someone who was open-minded and spoke more than one language, but not someone who came from a similar cultural background to avoid having someone who was brought up \u201cwith the same prejudices\u201d, he explains.  \u201cIt was important to me for my therapist to not think that I was doing what I was doing because I am Jordanian. That\u2019s too simple. I have many more layers than this.\u201d The therapist he found, and with whom he worked for five years, was an Austrian woman. He thought a woman \u2013 rather than a man \u2013 would be more sympathetic and helpful when it came to coming to terms with issues tied to his sexuality and the idea of what a family unit could look like. \u201cWorking with someone who was multicultural but different than me, it was interesting \u2013 sometimes she made me explain certain cultural contexts that she didn\u2019t know about. Something I never would have had to do with someone from my culture. And when I did that, explaining the meaning of a specific word or context, that made me realize how much it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Brito, the special education teacher, says that sometimes the most understanding you can be starts with the very opposite feeling. \u201cUnderstanding is partly saying hey, I don\u2019t understand that completely, tell me about it, and then listening.\u201d",
