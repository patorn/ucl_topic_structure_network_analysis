Related: America's Trump nightmare has arrived | Lucia Graves    The last two party leaders to occupy the White House, George W Bush and George HW Bush, remained in isolation and denial on Thursday after issuing statements suggesting they would not even acknowledge its next nominee for president, let alone lend him their support. \u201cPresident George W Bush does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign,\u201d read a blunt statement from his office that appears to go far beyond mere pique at Trump\u2019s treatment of brother Jeb.  Nebraska GOP senator Ben Sasse, meanwhile, moved on to the next stage, voicing the anger felt by many grassroots conservatives outside Washington and calling for a third candidate to emerge as an alternative to Trump and Hillary Clinton. \u201cWhy are we confined to these two terrible choices? This is America. If both choices stink, we reject them and go bigger. That\u2019s what we do,\u201d wrote Sasse in an impassioned open letter that went viral on Twitter and Facebook.  Others in Congress appear ready for bargaining, a phase of seeking to regain control that psychologists describe as a normal reaction to feelings of helplessness after a loss. \u201cAs the presumptive nominee, [Trump] now has the opportunity and the obligation to unite our party around our goals,\u201d wrote the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in language that made clear his desire to make the best of a bad situation.  But Trump has won landslide after landslide among Republican voters by positioning himself as the ultimate political outsider. There is little evidence he plans to tinker with a winning formula to make congressional leaders feel better. Realisation of this fact is leading many figures in the party to sink into depression, particularly as they ponder Trump\u2019s historically high negative poll ratings among the general electorate. \u201cMr Trump may be able to improve his image if he controls his perpetual insult machine, but there is little evidence that he can or will do so,\u201d lamented the Wall Street Journal in an editorial that captured the anguish of the establishment on Thursday. \u201cThe essence of his politics is personal, and it\u2019s not obvious he knows any other way.\u201d     If he\u2019s going to build that wall, he\u2019s going to have to mend a lot of fences    The newspaper\u2019s \u201csilver lining\u201d scenario in the unlikely case of him winning the general election involves him leaving domestic policy to the grownups, but it describes his foreign policy instincts as \u201cfar more troubling\u201d.  \u201cHis trade policies are reckless and would either be rebuffed by the world or lead to a global recession,\u201d warned the editorial board of the paper, a conservative bellwether known to stay close to the views of its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch\u2019s wider business empire might now be willing to dance with Trump on Fox News, but his previous flirtations with Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Bush belie frustration with their failure to inspire voters. \u201cMr Trump wasn\u2019t our first choice, or even the 15th,\u201d added the Journal. \u201cDozens of miscalculations made his hostile takeover possible, not least decisions by other candidates in the early primary states to attack each other instead of Mr Trump.\u201d After denial, anger, bargaining and depression ought to come a final stage of grief known as acceptance, but psychologists warn that \u201creaching this stage of mourning is a gift not afforded to everyone\u201d. The price of acceptance, according to moderate Republican figurehead Susan Collins, is for Trump to recognise that all his bluster will come to nought if he cannot win over women like her. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to build that wall that he keeps talking about, he\u2019s going to have to mend a lot of fences. He\u2019s going to have to stop with the gratuitous, personal insults,\u201d the Maine senator said in a radio interview on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to go beyond saying he wants to make America great again,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to articulate what a Trump presidency would look like.\u201d The former senator Bob Dole will be listening. On Thursday a representative of the 92-year-old 1996 nominee told the Guardian: \u201cSenator Dole is planning to briefly attend the convention in Cleveland.\u201d The representative would not say if the only former nominee set to travel to Ohio in July would support Trump in his run for the White House.  \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how the convention plays out,\u201d the representative said. It is not the first time the party has risked a split. Republican political activists known as Mugwumps supported Democratic candidate Grover Cleveland in 1884, whose centre-right supporters were also known as Gold Democrats in 1896. The Republican party split again into a so-called Bull Moose wing in 1912. But rarely have both the establishment wing of the party and its ideologically conservative base looked as uncomfortable as they do at the prospect of uniting behind the notion of presidential candidate Trump, something most acknowledge they will have to do, but few are relishing.",
