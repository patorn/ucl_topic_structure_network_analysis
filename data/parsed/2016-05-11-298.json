A similar format \u2013 20 teams, 38 matches for each team \u2013 yet the margins between the teams were tighter than a Floridian vote count. Well not quite, but they were close: by the end of the season, just four points separated Woolwich Arsenal in sixth and Manchester City in 19th. City had not been in the dreaded bottom two all season \u2013 in fact they had roared to the top of the league on the opening day owing to a 1-0 win against Sunderland (level points then decided by goal average \u2013 goals scored divided by goals conceded \u2013 thereby rewarding those who scored fewer goals) and had floated about in mid-table ever since, owing to their excellent home record (12 wins from 19, only The Wednesday, Sunderland and champions Newcastle had more) and dismal away record. The polar nature of the club was reflected on the terraces too, with attendances ranging from 40,000 to 3,000 throughout the campaign. Yet come the business end of the season, City were on the brink and lost their final match 1-0 away at Bristol City.   Related: Have two European Cup winners played each other in the second tier? | The Knowledge    Now hovering precariously in 18th, one place above the relegation zone, they were forced to wait until the next day to find out their fate, with 19th-placed Liverpool\u2019s match against Newcastle delayed because not two days previous, the north-east club had played in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge, defeating Southern League champions Northampton Town \u2013 managed by Herbert Chapman (the match raised \u00a3226 for charity, with \u00a345 going to both clubs and 12 London hospitals each receiving approximately \u00a310). Returning home to the north-east, tired and perhaps a little worse for wear, the already-crowned champions and Charity Shield winners Newcastle slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat, with Ronald Orr\u2019s goal saving Liverpool and condemning Manchester City to not only the Second Division, but the nickname, Typical City. Hat-tip to Malcolm Warburton for flagging that one up. \u201cI\u2019ve a feeling that Millwall\u2019s 1995-96 Division One relegation might count,\u201d feels David Hopkins. \u201cAt Christmas they were in the promotion race, and lost narrowly at home to Derby, who would end up second. After Christmas they dropped like a stone, and ended up in the bottom three having drawn their last game while Portsmouth won.\u201d Indeed Millwall were top of the league that season until 9 December with 34 points from 21 games \u2013 Chris Malkin leading the line magnificently, ably supported by Alex Rae in midfield \u2013 but the London club only add 18 more points in their remaining 25 games and were relegated on the final day after Portsmouth leapfrogged them with a 1-0 win \u201con a sandy wastes of a Huddersfield pitch worn grassless by a winter under the studs of rugby league\u201d, according to the Portsmouth Evening News, with Deon Burton doing the damage with his left boot. \u201cYork City started the final day of 1998-99 Division Two above Wycombe and Oldham,\u201d starts Phil Boyle, \u201dboth of whom needed to win to send York down, and had not been in the relegation zone at any point all season as of 3pm that day. York got thumped 4-0 away at Man City (!!!). Oldham beat Reading 2-0 at Boundary Park. Wycombe cruelly left it until the 83rd minute against Lincoln to secure a 1-0 win at Sincil Bank thus sending York down, having spent only seven minutes all season in the drop zone.\u201d \u201cHellas Verona in Serie A in 2001-02 managed to achieve this,\u201d emails Liam Derry. \u201cFor much of the season they were around mid-table, before a late slump and a last day defeat to relegation rivals Piacenza left them in the bottom four for the first time. Verona\u2019s squad contained future World Cup winners Massimo Oddo, Mauro Camoranesi and Alberto Gilardino, as well as Adrian Mutu.\u201d Hellas were also relegated this season, although of course they have been in the drop zone for a while, but that didn\u2019t stop Luca Toni and co doing this at the weekend. \u201cI believe in 1986-87 Lincoln City were never bottom of the Football League until after the final day of the season, as they made unwanted history by being the first side automatically relegated to the Conference following a poor run in the second half of the season,\u201d remembers Andy Boyd. \u201cOn the last day they lost at Swansea City, Torquay United drew with a David Platt-led Crewe Alexandra with a late equaliser in time added on after Torquay\u2019s Jim McNichol had been bitten by a police dog.\u201d McNichol, now a pub owner in Devon, wrote this for the Guardian about the incident in 2009 \u2013 \u201cI had three different holes in my leg and I got 17 stitches.\u201d \u201cHow about Sheffield United who went down to the Fourth Division in 1980-81?\u201d suggests Simon Atkinson. \u201cHaving never been in the bottom four until the last day, a 1-1 draw with Walsall at Bramall Lane was not good enough to save them. Don Givens missed a penalty for the Blades, and after the final whistle when it was falsely reported that results elsewhere had in fact granted a reprieve, the most modest aspiration ever to be turned into a football chant (\u2018Staying up, staying up, staying up!\u2019) reverberated gleefully around the ground for a minute or two. Sadly it was not borne out by the facts.\u201d \u201cMy team Bristol Rovers,\u201d sobs Peter Cole, \u201csuffered this dubious honour in 2014 when being relegated from League Two to the Conference.\u201d Rovers could only struggle to a 1-0 defeat at Mansfield while Wycombe Wanderers\u2019 3-0 win at already-relegated Torquay meant that they pipped Rovers on goal difference. Ouch. At least things have got better since. Gavin Parnaby says \u201cperhaps unsurprisingly this happened to Middlesbrough in the old First Division. After liquidation/resurrection in 1986, Bruce Rioch\u2019s kids were promoted from the Third Division to the First Division in successive seasons. But in 1988-89 they were relegated on the last day of the season \u2013 the only time they were in a relegation spot. Villa were the club that climbed above them after the final match. Perhaps selling Gary Pallister to Manchester United for \u00a32.3m had something to do with it.\u201d And here\u2019s JH Bach: \u201cIn the 2007-08 season of the German second tier (2 Bundesliga), Kickers Offenbach managed exactly that. Losing 3-0 on the last day against fellow relegation strugglers Osnabr\u00fcck, Offenbach fell from 13th to 15th place for the first time that season. That was incidentally also the last season where four teams out of 18 were regularly relegated from the league. It\u2019s been two relegation spots and one play-off spot ever since.\u201d Two relegations, one season \u201cFurther to your thread \u2018which managers have helped send two clubs down in one season?\u2019 from 2008, it is to my dismay as a proud York City fan that a twist on this undesirable feat has been achieved by our manager, Jackie McNamara,\u201d writes Paul Begley, fittingly emailing from the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. McNamara started the season at Dundee United, also relegated (from the Scottish Premiership), taking five points from the opening nine games. \u201cIs McNamara the first manager to relegate two teams in the same season in different countries?\u201d In a word, Paul, yes. No other manager has started a club\u2019s slow march towards relegation, hopped over a national border and finished the job with another club, apart from our Jackie, who remarkably remains at the helm at York City, despite his own unenviable personal record this season. As is well documented in our 2008 article above, there are a number of managers that have managed the feat in one country: Billy McNeill in 1986-87 (Manchester City, Aston Villa), Ron Saunders in 1985-86 (Birmingham City, West Bromwich Albion), Dave Bassett (Watford, Sheffield United).     \u2018Help.\u2019 Photograph: ANL/Rex/Shutterstock    Since that article was published, we can add Gary Johnson to the list, who took both Yeovil Town and Cheltenham Town down from their respective divisions last season. Having suffered relegation from the Championship in 2013-14, Yeovil struggled to adapt to League One and sacked Johnson in February last year, before taking up the reins at Cheltenham in League Two just a few weeks later. Johnson could not prevent them falling out of the Football League but was rewarded with a two-year contract in June a year ago. \u201cThe good thing is that I\u2019ve spent a honeymoon period here,\u201d said the former Latvia manager upon Cheltenham\u2019s relegation. \u201cNot a very pretty lady I was honeymooning with, but it was good that I was able to see who was committed.\u201d It proved a good decision in the end, as Cheltenham ripped through the Conference this season, finishing top with 101 points. Train stations v town size (2) \u201cWatford has 10 stations within a two-mile radius of the ground. Watford North, Watford Junction, Watford High Street, Watford (Metropolitan Line), Watford Vicarage Road (to open), Cassiobridge (to open), Bushey, Croxley Green, Carpenders Park and Moor Park,\u201d emailed Chris Parrott, following on from last week\u2019s blog. \u201cDoes any club (outside London) have more?\u201d   Related: From which train trip in Britain can you see the most league football grounds? | The Knowledge    If there\u2019s one thing we do know, it\u2019s that you lot really like trains. And football. A lot. \u201cTo answer the spin-off-spin-off question on the greatest number of railway stations within a two-mile radius of a football ground, I must first point out that Chris Parrott is wrong in his assertion regarding Watford,\u201d figures Tom Conniffe. \u201cCroxley Green saw its last train in 1996 and Watford (Metropolitan line) will close in 2020 when the two new stations he mentions, at Watford Vicarage Road and Cassiobridge, will open. So Watford currently has just seven, which will rise to eight when the Metropolitan line is extended through them to Watford Junction.\u201d \u201cI think Southport, of the National League, can beat Doncaster\u2019s supporters per railway station,\u201d writes the ambiguously named James M. \u201cIf you include all the stations within the town boundary, it has Ainsdale, Hillside and Birkdale on Merseyrail\u2019s line to Liverpool, the terminus at Southport itself and Meols Cop on the line towards Manchester. With an average of 1133 supporters per game this season, that makes 227 supporters per station.\u201d This week\u2019s winner, though, is Liam Corte. \u201cThe borough of Stockport is covered by a spider web of railways, and as a result has 19 train stations within its boundary. The full list is: Bramhall, Bredbury, Brinnington, Cheadle Hulme, Davenport, Gatley, Hazel Grove, Heald Green, Heaton Chapel, Marple, Middlewood, Reddish North, Reddish South, Romiley, Rose Hill Marple, Stockport, Strines, Woodley, and Woodsmoor. A population of 286,755 means one station for every 15,092 residents. For a ratio of stations/supporters, the famous Stockport County averaged 3,082 in 2015/16 which works out at 162 County fans per station.\u201d Knowledge: update \u201cAnother season, another promotion for Portuguese coach Vitor Oliveira,\u201d noted Romeu Duarte this time last year. \u201cThis time it was Uni\u00e3o da Madeira, his eighth promotion, from the second division to the first tier (or seventh if we exclude last year as he was sacked before the end of the season): P. Ferreira 90-91, Acad\u00e9mica 96-97, U. Leiria 97-98, Belenenses 98-99, Leix\u00f5es 06-07, Arouca 12-13, Moreirense 13-14 and U. Madeira 14-15.\u201d But Romeu\u2019s back! \u201cTime to update this record,\u201d he writes. \u201cCoach Oliveira managed to outdo himself by promoting another team to the top flight, his ninth time doing it. GD Chaves was the lucky club (after 17 years of absence).\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cI know that you\u2019ve covered why Ryan Giggs couldn\u2019t play for England in the past, but I was wondering if it was true that Harry Kewell could have worn the Three Lions?\u201d asked Leo Martin back in 2005. Unlike Giggsy, it turns out that Harry Kewell could have played for England, despite his Australian upbringing. Thanks to his father Rod being born in England, the fact that Harry himself was born in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs, where he also grew up, would not have hampered his English eligibility. Playing for the Socceroos against Iran in a World Cup qualifying play-off at the age of 17, however, did. Having been invited to train with Leeds as a 15-year-old, Kewell flew to England and was able to stay with relatives as he soon made an impact at Elland Road, earning a first-team debut at the age of 16. But while voices behind the scenes attempted to persuade the youngster to pledge his allegiance to his adopted home, Kewell refused to budge. \u201cI was born and bred in Australia and I\u2019ve always wanted to wear the green and gold,\u201d said Kewell. \u201cThe thought of playing for England never crossed my mind. There was never any doubt; my country is Australia.\u201d     Harry Kewell could have declared himself for England, but instead became the youngest ever footballer to play for Australia in 1996.

Can you help? \u201cWhat is the worst result a team has suffered in the final game of their stay at a home stadium?\u201d asks Mike Small. \u201cAt the weekend we saw Ritchie de Laet win promotion from the Championship on loan at Middlesbrough, while also winning (and qualifying for a winners medal) the Premier League with his parent club Leicester City,\u201d notices Fritz Maddrell. \u201cThis made me wonder if there is a player who has in fact won two leagues in the same season?\u201d (Also asked by Xavier Lizin and Gooner Holic). \u201cThe Teesdale Way passes through Middlesbrough FC,\u201d tweets Danny Last. \u201cFulham are another, of course, with the Thames Path, and Nottingham Forest have the Trent Valley Way passing by. How many other clubs have a long-distance walking path alongside the stands?\u201d \u201cAre there any \u2018local\u2019 derbies between two teams from different countries?\u201d wonders Alan Boag. The Rev Sam Bailey asks: \u201cWith all this talk about Andy King winning three titles with Leicester, it struck me - what\u2019s the furthest a player has gone down with a team? Has anyone stuck with a team for three relegations? Four? I should probably start my search with Blackpool, but figured I\u2019d let some one else do the heavy lifting.\u201d \u201cMick Byrne played in four separate spells for Shamrock Rovers,\u201d asserts Nick Williamson. \u201cHas any player had more separate spells with a club?\u201d Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or get in touch via Twitter @TheKnowledge_GU",
