These are the preliminary findings of a major study into increased restrictions on receiving benefits in the UK welfare system, published in full on Thursday. The research, led by the University of York, also shows the controversial extension of benefit sanctions to working people on universal credit (UC) can produce disincentives to work.    In-work conditionality for UC claimants is saying to low-paid workers, \u2018you\u2019re in work but that\u2019s not enough'    Under in-work conditionality, UC claimants who are already working up to 35 hours a week \u2013 and who may never have been unemployed in their life \u2013 are forced to seek more work hours, higher pay, or an extra job as a condition of receiving low-wage top-ups and other benefits, or else face sanctions. Low-paid workers put through this process report \u201cdehumanising\u201d and \u201cintimidating\u201d experiences. \u201cThe moment I walked into the jobcentre, I felt criminalised. It was as if I\u2019m signing up to prison or something,\u201d says Mark Wallis (not his real name), a respondent in his 50s, working part-time in catering while claiming UC. Wallis says he hasn\u2019t \u201cgot a clue about computers \u2026 they frighten me\u201d, but he is required by Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) advisers to attend jobcentre interviews and use its official online system, the much-criticised Universal Jobmatch, to conduct and record job searches. As of this month, in-work conditionality will have been imposed on 15,000 low-paid workers like Wallis in a handful of trials across the UK. Wallis says he felt he was an \u201cin-work guinea pig\u201d for UC. The study found similar resentment from many in-work UC recipients who, in direct contrast to years of government rhetoric about \u201chardworking people\u201d, suddenly found themselves subject to the same sanctions as out-of-work claimants. Glaringly, the study also found \u201ca mismatch\u201d between the flexibility required by employers and the rigidity of UC job search requirements and Jobcentre Plus appointments systems with people who are already committed to a job forced to find time to go to the jobcentre. Peter Dwyer, professor of social policy at the University of York, who leads the Economic and Social Research Council-funded study, says the move to in-work conditionality for UC claimants is \u201ca significant new step\u201d by the government. \u201cYou\u2019re saying to low-paid workers, \u2018you\u2019re in work but that\u2019s not enough\u2019. In a way, that\u2019s redefining the nature of welfare dependency,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was jobseekers, disabled people, lone parents \u2026 it\u2019s \u2018now we\u2019ll take it a step further to low-paid workers\u2019.\u201d This \u201cnew step\u201d reflects a fundamental tension at the heart of the government\u2019s plans for welfare: rather than investigating the concerns about the effectiveness and safety of benefit sanctions, the Conservative government is instead extending them. The research is based on detailed interviews with almost 500 people, including UC claimants, jobseekers, single parents, disabled people and social housing tenants, across 10 UK cities and towns, as well as civil servants, third-sector organisations, MPs and others. The five-year study will conclude in 2018.   Related: Government's Universal Jobmatch website 'bedevilled with fraud'    UC bundles six current benefits into a single payment. It was designed to encourage people to work more hours. The study found \u201cvery limited evidence\u201d of benefit sanctions bringing about what is seen as positive behavioural change such as people moving into work. The common thread linking stories of success wasn\u2019t so much the threat or experience of having benefit cut, but the availability of appropriate individual support. However, the study found that, overwhelmingly, experiences of support from Jobcentre Plus or the government\u2019s outsourced Work Programme were negative. \u201cThey don\u2019t really help you to find a job,\u201d said one man who was claiming UC while out of work. \u201cThey just help you to sign on every two weeks \u2026 you go in, and they say: \u2018Right, come back in two weeks.\u2019\u201d Increased debt and eviction threats, as well as anxiety and ill health, were all common outcomes of benefit sanctions, the study found. A disabled man who had been sanctioned spoke of being asked during a hospital appointment why he had lost weight (\u201cWell, I can\u2019t eat. I\u2019ve got no money.\u201d), while a diabetic man \u2013 who hadn\u2019t been able to eat after being sanctioned for \u201cnot applying for enough jobs\u201d \u2013 reported having to ask the jobcentre for \u00a34 to get the bus to the city centre so that he could make a claim for an emergency hardship payment. The study also found many interviewees put through the conditionality system were already in vulnerable positions, such as those with mental health issues, domestic violence victims and homeless people. \u201cI got a sanction [for a month] for not going to an interview,\u201d said one man who was homeless. \u201cI couldn\u2019t survive with no money \u2026 So if I needed something, I\u2019d have to \u2018borrow it\u2019 from [the supermarket],\u201d he added, alluding to shoplifting to feed himself. Children were also found to suffer when their parents had their benefits stopped after falling foul of the sanction\u2019s regime. Some parents talked of skipping meals to prevent their children from going hungry. \u201cMy daughter couldn\u2019t attend school for two weeks,\u201d said one mother after being sanctioned. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any money for that; you have to give her some money every day for some lunch and for a bus.\u201d A DWP spokesman says: \u201cThis report completely fails to recognise that there are near record numbers in work and that the number of benefit sanctions has fallen dramatically. It\u2019s only right that there are conditions attached to receiving benefits \u2013 this is nothing new. Sanctions are a longstanding part of the welfare system, but decisions are not taken lightly, and they are only applied where people fail to engage with the support on offer.\u201d",
