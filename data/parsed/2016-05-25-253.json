Many small businesses are therefore keen to recruit staff from as broad a range of backgrounds as possible. So what practical steps can an SME take to increase diversity in its workforce? The starting point for many firms looking to hire new team members will be to place a job advertisement. Objectivity is key at this initial stage to ensure you are attracting candidates from as wide a pool as possible. It will also help employers avoid walking unwittingly into an anti-discrimination lawsuit. Justin Govier, head of the employment team at IBB Solicitors, says the advert should be factual and set out what you are looking for in an unbiased way. You should put it in as many places as possible so you reach as many people as possible. The process of filtering candidates should also be conducted as an objective tick-box exercise looking at the skills and qualifications you require as a business. Charles Hipps, CEO of e-recruitment company WCN, advises small businesses to think carefully about how they conduct interviews. For example, questions should focus on competencies and strengths rather than environments that may only be familiar to people from certain backgrounds. \u201cOne of the things that can have a massive impact on the success of a candidate during an interview is the context in which the problem you are asking them to solve is set,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you are recruiting graduates and you set all your questions in the context of an environment that a white, middle-class person would be most familiar with, that will automatically favour some people over others. Not because of what the actual question is \u2013 it might be a mathematical puzzle or verbal reasoning \u2013 but simply because of the context that supports it.\u201d He also suggests having team members from the particular group you are trying to attract present during the recruitment process \u2013 whether that\u2019s meeting and greeting candidates or on the interview panel. \u201cIt will make candidates feel more comfortable and recognise that they can succeed in that company environment, but also it might be an inexpensive way of removing unconscious bias.\u201d Last year, a CIPD report, A head for hiring: the behavioural science of recruitment and selection, found that a recruiter\u2019s initial perceptions of whether a person will be a good fit can be determined by visual, cultural, demographic and situational factors. One example of this is evidence that we hire mini-mes \u2013 people who are similar to us in terms of hobbies, experiences and how we dress or present ourselves at interview. This is known as the affinity bias, which leads people to like those who are similar to them or someone they know; the exposure effect causes us to like things we have been exposed to. Removing all obstacles to discrimination during the application process has historically proved a challenge. The CIPD report points to research, which shows that if one gender or ethnicity is stereotyped as poor in a particular subject this can create anxiety for those in that group, and this can negatively impact their performance in a test on that subject. New technology may hold the answer to further improving equal opportunities in recruitment and lessening any bias. Arctic Shores, for example, is a startup that has developed a game-based psychometric assessment that measures cognitive processes such as resilience and problem solving. The data collected by the game shows how candidates instinctively respond to given situations, thereby helping employers gain a better understanding of how that person will perform once in the role and whether they are a good fit for the company. With more than half of gamers women, its creators, Robert Newry and Dr Safe Hammad, claim their product has the potential to better engage young, female candidates and prevent them from dropping out of the application process too soon. Elevate, a recruitment technology firm, is also helping companies remove unconscious bias and identify the best candidates for any given role. The platform developed by the firm uses algorithms to score every candidate\u2019s CV, previous work experience, skills and education, and assesses their suitability for a role. It then ranks candidates much like Google\u2019s search results. Dan Collier, the company\u2019s CEO, says that although it won\u2019t say that this is the person the employer should hire, it can recommend new potential applicants based on past hiring patterns at that organisation. \u201cWe consider lots of different things, including skills and cultural fit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is making sense of the decisions that until now have been made by a human.\u201d No matter how hi-tech or innovative you make the application and interview process, real change only happens when a business is able to show candidates evidence that it works to its own values of diversity. Bev Hurley has spent the past 30 years building successful businesses and championing female entrepreneurship. She started her career working with London housing associations during the 1980s before setting up two businesses of her own in housing and interior design. In 1999, she joined business growth company YTKO as chief executive and has since gone on to champion equality by setting up the Enterprising Women programme, which provides help and support to female entrepreneurs. \u201cIt is really important that diversity is reflected in leadership because it starts at the top and you have to be role models for those working their way up,\u201d she says. \u201cWe now have a senior management team that is 50/50 men and women.\u201d Hurley claims YTKO\u2019s interest in diversity also extends to its client base, which it monitors carefully to ensure there is a mix of genders, ethnicities, age and other demographics. She says the company\u2019s commitment to diversity is \u201cnot just lip service \u2013 it runs all the way through our organisation\u201d. Recruiting a diverse workforce hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. She says: \u201cWhen we were smaller and had just 10 to 15 staff, and three ladies went on maternity leave within two months of each other, I thought the world was going to end. I had no idea how I was going to recruit for the post. It could be for six months or even a year. I was really struggling with the whole concept.\u201d Greater access to flexible and remote working is making it easier for small businesses to meet the demands of a diverse team, she says. In particular, it has meant more working parents are able to juggle their career with family life. Hurley claims offering these kinds of working practices boosts loyalty and improves retention of talented staff. \u201cWe are a diverse society and it is important that we have a company that reflects society as a whole,\u201d she adds. \u201cOtherwise it is all full of middle-aged men in suits \u2013 everything would be skewed. You get better decision making, greater morale and greater understanding of the world through having a diverse team.\u201d Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.",
