  "body": "Obsessive Compulsive Country House Cleaners 8pm, Channel 4 This lifestyle-clash docutainment show sends clean freaks into the houses of filthy herberts and tries to do something a bit more edifying than just gawp at everyone\u2019s neuroses. There\u2019s\u00a0a twist this year: the\u00a0grubby abodes are stately homes. Tonight, Kelly and Dave, both diagnosed with OCD, arrive at knackered Yorkshire manor Forcett Hall. The owners want to run it as a B&B, but there\u2019s a sink splattered with bird poo to fix first. Jack Seale In the Club 9pm, BBC1 A new baby will bring on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and that\u2019s very much the sensation provided by this Kay Mellor-authored series. Comedy? Drama? It\u2019s quite hard to say at times, with serious issues \u2013 adoption, responsibility, a good home \u2013 often dealt with in an unbelievable, if oddly predictable way. So it is tonight, as Andrew and Nathan prepare to bring baby Sebastian home. Shelley\u2019s not bothered, but Maxine has a bigger bombshell to drop. John Robinson Old School With the Hairy Bikers 9pm, BBC2 The Bikers have come to the end of their school experiment, mixing teens from the Oxford Academy school with local pensioners. Although all involved would say that it\u2019s made a tangible difference to their lives, the project desperately needs further funding if it is to continue. So the bikers enlist the kids and the old folk to help them pitch to charities, councillors and business leaders. There will be tears by the end. But the good kind. Ben Arnold The KKK: Behind the\u00a0Mask 9pm, Channel 5 It feels possible that the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s members are by now outnumbered by the documentaries that have been made about them. This film recounts the wretched saga once more. It chronicles the Klan\u2019s ascent to startling size and influence in the decades after the US civil war \u2013 by the 1920s, it claimed four million members \u2013 and its decline to its present sorry state as a marginal huddle of especially delusional racists. Andrew Mueller Rovers 10pm, Sky1 Joe Wilkinson and Dave Earl\u2019s amiable new series \u2013 starring Craig Cash and Sue\u00a0Johnston among others \u2013 is set in the clubhouse of lowly football team Redbridge Rovers, whose fans dream of promotion to the Evo-Stik Premier League. It\u2019s essentially about the characters who congregate in the canteen to banter and bicker very Britishly, and the rich bathos\u00a0of their exchanges: \u201cIf we win today,\u00a0we go to 16th. You don\u2019t get that buzz at a llama\u00a0park.\u201d David\u00a0Stubbs Vikings 10pm, History Previously seen on Amazon Prime, the third season of adventures for chieftain Ragnar Lothbrok is finally available for those with less-than-smart TVs. Following the raids that marked the previous season finale, a whole new world of wonder and plunder has been opened up for the Scandi-scoundrels. With Ragnar calling the shots, a return to Wessex is on the cards. Unfortunately, their arrival is welcomed with a punishing to-do list from King Ecbert. Mark Gibbings-Jones The Last Whites of the\u00a0East End 10.45pm, BBC1 The absurdly provocative title of Kelly Close\u2019s excellent film (guess which tabloid virtually transcribed the entire programme and passed it off as a feature), about the would-be \u201cbesieged\u201d cockneys of heavily multicultural Newham, is a bit misleading.\u00a0Although showcasing some very illiberal opinions, this affords equal time to some sober, progressive voices \u2013 along with those making the case for assimilation \u2013 in a consistently compelling watch.

They are infesting the snowy Alaskan town of Barrow, where Josh Hartnett\u2019s sheriff and a bunch of survivors find themselves under siege for a month, until the sun next comes up. An efficiently gory horror show from the director of Hard Candy.
