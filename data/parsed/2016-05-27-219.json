  "body": "When Australian-born author and restaurateur Janet DeNeefe first visited Ubud as a teenager over 40 years ago, it was a traditional Balinese village, a cluster of terracotta rooftops snuggled amid ancient rice terraces and jungle gorges.  \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a food scene back then,\u201d she recalls.  Having fallen in love with Bali and met and married a Balinese man in 1984, DeNeefe moved to Ubud and has gone on to open restaurants, bars and a cookery school in the area. This weekend, the second incarnation of her Ubud food festival will draw thousands to the lush green spaces and concealed restaurants along the Ayung Gorge. Needless to say, there will be much, much more on the menu than the 70s staples of cheese toasties, dodgy pasta and nasi goreng.     A market at the festival. Photograph: Matthew Oldfield    Even before Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s bestselling 2006 book Eat, Pray, Love put Ubud on the self-discovery bucket list, this bustling tourist town was a spirituality and wellness destination. Diana Von Cranach, who will preview her new Herb Library restaurant at the festival, pioneered the living food movement. Alchemy, the raw, vegan cafe concept, has helped make Ubud a purist eating destination, too. The town has also proved a focal point for reviving and refining traditional Balinese produce and cuisine. The Balinese heritage black pig was close to extinction a few years ago. Later this month, the porkers will star in a beauty parade, a 20-course tasting menu, and more.     Moziac, one of Ubud\u2019s fine-dining restaurants    It is a relatively small event for Indonesia, where major cities often showcase local specialities. But, says Jakarta-based food consultant Arie Parikesit: \u201cIn terms of the breadth of topics and depth of content, it\u2019s the most comprehensive festival in the country.\u201d While Ubud is home to world-class fine-dining restaurants, such as Mozaic, Hujan Locale and Locavore \u2013 which will launch its long-awaited cocktail lounge, Rooster, at the festival \u2013 there\u2019s more than restaurants to the foodie scene. \u201cYou have interesting venues in Ubud,\u201d says Parikesit. \u201cBut in the area, you have fresh produce, plantations, markets. It\u2019s a small town, but surrounded by a lot of great producers.\u201d     Ubud has become a centre for fine dining. Photograph: Anggara Mahendra    So the festival lineup is genuinely diverse. Besides picnics, tastings, cook-offs and demos, a food market, farm tours and food tours, there are classes in food photography, food writing and social media \u2013 not to mention a pastry class for kids and sessions on foodie language basics. Indonesian industry luminaries from William Wongso to Sisca Soewitomo will be appearing; local produce from coffee, tea and chocolate to spices, herbal tonics and organic greens will star.     Pasar Malam night market, Ubud Food Festival. Photograph: Anggara Mahendra    And, amazingly for a town where the plastic cheese toastie was once a restaurant staple, there\u2019s even Balinese cheese on the menu, matured using ingredients ranging from fermented durian and Indonesian long pepper to tamarind and burnt cinnamon. Looking for a more traditional taste of Indonesia? Parikesit recommends visiting Ubud market in the morning for vegetarian savoury rice porridge from Ibu Tesa, and heading to Ibu Mangku\u2019s place in Kedewatan for authentic chicken dishes. \u2022 The Ubud Food Festival runs from 27-29 May, ubudfoodfestival.com",
