  "body": "This ambitious graphic biography of Edvard Munch, translated by Francesca M Nichols, its text almost entirely direct quotes from the artist and his contemporaries, took seven years to complete. The resulting story sometimes jars, but shines a bright light on the Norwegian artist. The text\u2019s shifts in style are matched by dark artwork that mixes caricatured renderings of Munch\u2019s boozy, bickering bohemian clique with careful re-creations of works in progress, photos and images of mental strife. Kverneland pops up regularly to offer academic background and ribald quips, but never obscures his ambitious, self-absorbed subject, who travels from Norway to France and Germany, tussling with his critics from behind a comically protruding chin. The account explores Munch\u2019s troubled relationships with women and \u2013 in a touching series of panels \u2013 his own family; contemporary sources show just how seditious his approach seemed to the art establishment at the time. The publisher\u2019s Art Masters series already boasts some gems, and this clever, feverish labour of\u00a0love is a fine addition to the stable. \u2022 To order Munch for \u00a312.79 (RRP \u00a315.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
