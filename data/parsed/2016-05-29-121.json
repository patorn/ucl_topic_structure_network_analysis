  "body": "Leomie Anderson has a blog called Cracked China Cup. \u201cChina because it looks delicate and beautiful,\u201d she says, \u201ccracked because it\u2019s flawed and cup because it spills.\u201d It\u2019s here the 23-year-old Victoria\u2019s Secret model posts her videos (\u201cThe black model survival kit\u201d), her outfits of the day and, every now and again, something like this: \u201cIn light of recent stories that have surfaced from young girl nudes being leaked, slut shaming, sexual assault and more, I felt it was important to reach out to my young readers and discuss the issue of consent, being pressured and the right to say NO.\u201d It started with a tweet. One of those young readers messaged her: \u201cI\u2019ve been pressured into sending nudes, and FaceTiming naked by three different guys, and when you say no they try to make you feel bad about it.\u201d Anderson, who was 14 when she started modelling, says she felt compelled to reply. \u201cConsent is very important in my job. It\u2019s crucial.\u201d Since being scouted near her school in Tooting, south London, she has walked for Topshop and Moschino, as well as holding a coveted job as one of the Victoria\u2019s Secret models at the catwalk show that has become a sort of Oscars for pants. And in between being delicate and beautiful, she has \u201cspilled\u201d. When she wrote about the lack of make-up artists equipped to work with black models, with a backstage photograph of a rainbow of pink foundations, it sparked a row about diversity in the fashion industry. \u201cWhy is it that the black make-up artists are busy with blonde white girls\u2026 and I have to supply my own foundation? Why can a white model sit in anyone\u2019s chair and feel confident they\u2019ll look OK, but black models have to worry?\u201d And when, in April, she wrote about consent, she unwittingly started the next chapter of her career.   Related: Leomie Anderson: key summer trends for women \u2013 in pictures    \u201cIn the 90s models were expected to be mysterious. But today we\u2019re allowed to speak. Which is great, because I want to be known as more than a face.\u201d She visited a school in south London, where students told her that three of their friends had committed suicide after their nude photos had been shared. \u201cThese girls had nobody to talk to. Their reputations had been destroyed; their trust had disappeared. I went on breakfast TV to talk about it, because talking about it can\u2019t be taboo. Schools need to teach boys and girls about consent. And I wanted to tell young people to be careful, because online nothing disappears. And nothing ends well.\u201d Despite being young when she moved to New York to model, and despite finding herself in situations where she felt \u201cuncomfortable with the photographer\u201d, she always knew she could trust her agency. \u201cI\u2019d go to the toilet and call them.\u201d By the time she returned to set, the atmosphere would have changed. At school, she points out, girls are out there all alone. \u201cThe dangers aren\u2019t just old men, catfishing online. They\u2019re your friends, your exes. And once they\u2019ve got that picture, it\u2019s like they own you.\u201d What\u2019s her advice to girls? \u201cDon\u2019t do it! To parents, I\u2019d say they need to realise that if it happens, their daughters are victims, not sluts. Boys need to realise they\u2019re not entitled to a girl\u2019s body. And girls \u2013 they tear each other down to make themselves feel better. Misogyny is imprinted on them. But the easiest way to avoid it is by remembering that this exchange doesn\u2019t need to happen.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m not saying showing your body is a bad thing.\u201d Anderson became famous for modelling underwear. When she first discussed sexting, some commenters called her a hypocrite. \u201cDoing Victoria\u2019s Secret was the best time in my life. It was empowering. What I\u2019m talking about is not nudity, it\u2019s consent. OK?\u201d OK. Anderson\u2019s career has grown alongside social media and its impact on the industry means that what it means to be a model has changed. \u201cIn the time of Kate and Naomi it would take years to get a Vogue cover. Now it just takes followers. Gigi and Kendall? Supermodels? No way.\u201d Since talking about make-up artists on Twitter, she has decided not to discuss race and fashion \u201cbecause it changes nothing. Three years ago there was a big push to see more black models. That year I walked 13 shows. The next year, when it had died down? One. I\u2019ve stopped trying to get work in Milan any more. They\u2019ll say: \u2018Sorry, we don\u2019t want any Africans this season.\u2019 It would be easier if they just put a sign on the door, \u2018No blacks allowed.\u2019\u2019\u2019 She chuckles, and sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to say: \u2018We need more black models\u2019 than to investigate institutional racism in places where diversity really matters \u2013 police, government, even media.\u201d But, I say, you\u2019re not discussing that. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not discussing that any more.\u201d She holds my gaze for a second, before cracking into laughter.",
