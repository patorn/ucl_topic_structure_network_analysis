  "body": "Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese has ramped up his threat against the Liberal party, saying if the party directs its preferences towards his Greens opponent in the Sydney seat of Grayndler he will turn the issue into a national judgment on Malcolm Turnbull. He said the Liberal party for strategic reasons had still failed to rule out a preference deal with Jim Casey, the Greens\u2019 candidate in Grayndler, but the delay was putting them on the side of an avowed anticapitalist. He threatened to turn this into a national issue if the Liberal party hierarchy did not state publicly that it would not preference Casey.

The seat is a classic Sydney inner-west electorate comprising many students and young families.  The Greens are targeting the seat because they say the demographics are on their side, and if Albanese \u2013 who is a popular candidate \u2013 wasn\u2019t running they believe the seat would be for the taking. But ABC election analyst Antony Green says it is very likely Albanese will still win the seat, but a recent redistribution has made the challenge slightly harder.

The Victorian Liberal president Michael Kroger indicated in March that the Liberals may be prepared to enter a \u201cloose arrangement\u201d with the Greens in some circumstances, because they are \u201cnot the nutters they used to be\u201d. But Kroger\u2019s comments have angered some conservatives in the Liberal party, and some senior figures in the Greens, neither of which want to do any deal with the other.  Greens strategist admit that the only way Casey could win in Grayndler is with Liberal preferences.",
