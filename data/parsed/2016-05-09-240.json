  "body": "Harry Kane has called on Tottenham Hotspur to end their season on a high by beating Newcastle next Sunday, especially as doing so will guarantee the \u201creally good feeling\u201d of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1995. Spurs\u2019 2-1 defeat to Southampton on Sunday was their third successive match without victory and has seen a team who were pushing Leicester City for the Premier League title less a month ago now in danger of completing the campaign in third. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men can secured second place by winning at St James\u2019 Park during this coming weekend\u2019s final round of fixtures, when Arsenal, who are two points behind Spurs in third, play Aston Villa at the Emirates Stadium. Given Spurs\u2019 superior goal difference, a draw against Newcastle is also likely to keep them above Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side.   Related: Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend    Such has been the number of years since Spurs last finished above their local rivals in the top flight that Arsenal supporters have created a phrase \u2013 St Totteringham\u2019s Day \u2013 to mark the exact moment in a season when they can no longer mathematically catch their team. The \u2018celebration\u2019 has been in existence since 2002 and is something Pochettino has called on the White Hart Lane faithful to not obsess about, but Kane fully appreciates their desire to see it banished once and for all. \u201cIt would be a really good feeling [to finish above Arsenal],\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not something we focused on at the start of the season but now we are here it would be good, it would be good for the fans. \u201cWe all know what it means \u2013 we haven\u2019t won the league this year, but there is still a lot to play for and that is definitely one thing. So the fans are urging us on, they were great but just disappointed we couldn\u2019t do that [against Southampton] but there is still one more game and we will try our hardest. It is in our hands, we just have to win at Newcastle and then it\u2019s job done.\u201d Asked about Wenger\u2019s assertion that it would be a \u201cone-off\u201d were Spurs to finish above Arsenal this season, Kane added: \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion, they are going to want to finish above us next season and we will be trying to finish above them. We want to finish as high up as we can, we are not going to focus on anything but ourselves. We will finish the season strong and next season will go and they to win the title again.\u201d Sunday\u2019s defeat to Southampton was not only Spurs\u2019 third successive match without victory but also the third in a row in which they have thrown away a lead. The team look understandably jaded after a campaign in which they have delivered high-intensity performances on a regular basis and Kane admits that tiredness has crept into the squad . \u201cIt has been a long season, we have been fighting hard mentally and physically but I still think we looked good out there,\u201d said the forward. \u201cWe played good football, it is just in recent weeks, as people have seen, we haven\u2019t finished teams off. We have been going ahead and then maybe a lack of concentration. \u201cWe know what we are capable of, what squad we have got here and we are confident. We want to finish strong and win our last game and take that into next season.\u201d",
