  "body": "International support would certainly strengthen Greece\u2019s hand in seeking the return of the Parthenon marbles (Greece could turn to UN in battle for Parthenon marbles, 9 May). But how much support would they get? When I was British ambassador in Greece 20 years ago I was asked by a Greek MEP to forward a letter signed by a number of MEPs to John Major, then prime minister, asking for the return of the marbles. I said I was happy to do so, and suggested that the letter would carry more weight if it confirmed that the non-Greek MEPs who signed were at the same time lobbying their own governments to return any Parthenon marbles held in their national museums. My friend agreed that was a good idea and took back the letter. I never saw it again.Oliver MilesOxford  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
