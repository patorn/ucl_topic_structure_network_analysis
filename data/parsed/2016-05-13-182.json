Scherzinger, who was a judge for two seasons of the talent show, has pulled out of Cats on Broadway just before rehearsals began, Lloyd Webber said.  In a furious interview on Friday, the impresario said the singer had lost herself a possible Tony award.      Nicole Scherzinger as Grizabella at the London Palldium. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    \u201cA week before we were due to go into rehearsal for Cats on Broadway, which luckily I\u2019m not producing, she calls me and says she\u2019s decided she wants to do X Factor, having agreed everything,\u201d he told the Economist Radio. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s crazy. But the American producers just took a view, \u2018Well, fine, we\u2019ll get somebody else\u2019, because she\u2019s actually not very well known in America, amazingly. She\u2019s much better known here.\u201d  Lloyd Webber said he felt he had been made to look personally foolish by her return to the ITV show.  \u201cI\u2019m furious because I really believe she\u2019s the most fantastically talented girl and I went out on a limb to get her for the London Palladium here, and it makes me look like an absolute twot with them all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut never mind, there\u2019ll be another girl on Broadway and Nicole will not get her Tony award.\u201d    Andrew Lloyd Webber with me @EconomistRadio on the economics of musicals: and a cast change at Cats pic.twitter.com/e1N8zQefzx\u2014 anne mcelvoy (@annemcelvoy) May 13, 2016    It had not been officially confirmed that Scherzinger would rejoin the X Factor when the show returns to ITV. Fellow judge Simon Cowell will return, with the other two seats tipped to be filled by Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne. Scherzinger won some plaudits for her role in the West End revival of Cats in 2014, but one Guardian reviewer said she did not convince as faded glamourpuss Grizabella, who sings the show\u2019s most famous solo, Memory.  \u201cShe belts it out all right but is extremely implausible in her role as a has-been,\u201d wrote Susannah Clapp. \u201cAge has not even begun to get going on the withering process.\u201d",
