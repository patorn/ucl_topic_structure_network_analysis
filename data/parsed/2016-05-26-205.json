Clinton brushed off questions about her integrity on CNN: \u201cNothing has changed. It was not at all unprecedented. It will not affect my campaign or my presidency.\u201d Her likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has stepped up attacks on Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness, told a rally in California: \u201cShe\u2019s as dirty as they come.\u201d Both candidates, for starkly different reasons, are looking toward a separate FBI decision on whether to bring criminal charges over the breaches. House speaker Paul Ryan said Clinton\u2019s actions were \u201cat best negligent and at worst harmful\u201d to national security. Meanwhile, speaking to late-night TV host Jimmy Fallon, Trump confirmed he uses aliases, including the name Barron, and challenged Bernie Sanders to a debate ahead of the 7 June primary in California. (Clinton has turned down another debate with Sanders.) The leftwing Democratic candidate accepted, tweeting: \u201cGame on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.\u201d           Donald Trump tells Jimmy Kimmel: I have used aliases    Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server violated state department rules, audit finds \u2018It\u2019s beyond pain\u2019 In the second of a two-part series about opioid addiction Chris McGreal visits Salt Lake City where Mormons, who shun drugs and alcohol, have now fallen prey to painkiller addiction. \u201cMaline never thought she had a problem,\u201d Mindy Vincent says of her sister. \u201cShe was a firm believer that because the doctor prescribed the pills it was OK. But she was on the painkillers for 15 years until they wouldn\u2019t give her any more. She eventually ended up getting some heroin because she couldn\u2019t get any more pills. My sister used heroin one time and she died.\u201d You can read all our coverage in this series here.  \u2018It\u2019s beyond pain\u2019: how Mormons are left vulnerable in Utah\u2019s opiate crisis China to launch nuclear-armed subs  China is poised to send nuclear submarines into the Pacific Ocean for the first time. The move could further destabilise an already tense strategic standoff with the US in the South China Sea. Chinese military officials have indicated they consider the move inevitable, pointing to US plans to base anti-ballistic missiles in South Korea and the development of hypersonic glide missiles. Last week, a US spy plane and two Chinese fighter jets came close to colliding near Hainan island, where four Jin-Class ballistic missile-equipped subs are based. Meanwhile, Tom Phillips in Beijing examines Chinese efforts to curb the country\u2019s debt-fueled economy. China to send nuclear-armed submarines into Pacific amid tensions with US G7 talks underway Barack Obama and leaders of the seven major advanced economies are holding a G7 meeting at Ise-Shima in Japan to discuss major economic and trade issues. As Obama prepares to visit Hiroshima, the Guardian asked the president about nuclear proliferation. \u201cThe dropping of the atomic bomb was unprecedented in history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve all had to deal with.\u201d Obama also said North Korea was a \u201cbig worry for all of us\u201d, referring to the hermit nation\u2019s ongoing nuclear program, and spoke of the effort to protect the US and allies from an \u201cunexpected escalation\u201d. He also said foreign leaders were \u201crattled\u201d by Trump \u2013 \u201cand for good reason, because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines.\u201d G7 summit: Obama says Trump has \u2018rattled\u2019 world leaders \u2013 live coverage Exxon rejects climate change fears Rex Tillerson, the boss of oil giant ExxonMobil, told a shareholder meeting in Dallas that cutting oil production was \u201cnot acceptable for humanity\u201d. Resisting calls to explain how the company planned to address climate change and maintain Exxon\u2019s business, Tillerson said the company had invested $7bn in green technology. But until science and technology had achieved breakthroughs, \u201cjust saying \u2018turn the taps off\u2019 is not acceptable to humanity. The world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not\u201d. The Guardian was banned from reporting from inside the meeting, and instead listened to proceedings via webcast. \u201cWe are denying your request because of the Guardian\u2019s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting, demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers,\u201d a spokesman said. ExxonMobil CEO: ending oil production \u2018not acceptable for humanity\u2019 Peter Thiel v Gawker  As a judge in Florida rejects Gawker Media\u2019s request for a retrial of Hulk Hogan\u2019s invasion of privacy case against the website, the Guardian looks at Facebook investor Peter Thiel\u2019s campaign against the company initiated after founder Nick Denton set about outing him. Thiel, a Trump delegate in California, admitted to having bankrolled Hogan\u2019s action against Gawker, which resulted in a $140m damages award in favor of the wrestler. Gawker claims the action was designed to result in Denton\u2019s financial ruin.  PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel admits to bankrolling Hulk Hogan\u2019s Gawker lawsuit Black Dahlia\u2019s killer unmasked The 1947 killing and evisceration of Elizabeth Short continues to hold morbid fascination as one of the darkest of Los Angeles\u2019 unsolved murder cases. Former Los Angeles police department detective Steve Hodel briefs the Guardian on the astonishing claim he spent 15 years of cataloguing and forensic work to establish \u2013 that Short was killed by his own father, a prominent LA physician named George Hodel. As Alexis Sobel Fitts points out, Steve Hodel may be a brilliant vigilante or an obsessive crackpot, but no one has been able to prove him wrong. I know who killed the Black Dahlia: my own father Who cares about stats? Columnist Dave Schilling wades into the debate over our obsession with sports statistics, and specifically whether black people even care about them. Responding to an ESPN column on the subject, Schilling writes: \u201cI finally had an excuse for why I can\u2019t seem to understand or appreciate advanced sports analytics: I\u2019m black. Thank God, for a second I thought I was just stupid, lazy, or both.\u201d Sports analytics don\u2019t exist in \u2018BlackWorld\u2019? That\u2019s ridiculous A lost hiker\u2019s last message A hiker who died after a 26-day ordeal in the woods of western Maine kept a journal about her ordeal, and resigned herself to the idea that it could be years before her remains were found, it has emerged. Geraldine Largay, 66,  who was from Tennessee, had set out to walk from West Virginia to Mount Katahdin, a section of the 2,200 mile Appalachian Trail. But she got lost and her efforts to send SOS messages failed. Finally, she accepted she would die in the wilderness. One of her final log entries read: \u201cWhen you find my body, please call my husband George ... and my daughter Kerry. It will be the greatest kindness for them to know that I am dead where you found me \u2013 no matter how many years from now.\u201d Hiker who went missing on Appalachian Trail survived 26 days before dying Scully: a more exciting heroine After Gillian Anderson set off a Twitter storm after suggesting she should be the next Bond, film editor Catherine Shoard argues: \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be cooking up new heroines, rather than just sticking old ones in a frock?\u201d She adds: \u201cI am baffled by this kneejerk cheerleading for the prospect of a woman taking on a role that involves murdering your way round the globe, bashing and backstabbing, boozy and ruthless.\u201d Jane Bond is just James in a frock. We need a new heroine",
