  "body": "Bill Shorten has told David Leyonhjelm to drag his outdated views on gender equality into the 21st century after the Liberal Democrat senator criticised Shorten\u2019s pledge to fund more women\u2019s sport on television. \u201cBack to the cave, stone age man,\u201d the opposition leader said on the campaign trail in Cairns on Monday after Leyonhjelm had suggested women\u2019s sport was not interesting enough to warrant additional funding at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.   Related: Australian election 2016: Bill Shorten questioned over WestConnex funding \u2013 live    Shorten announced in Canberra on Sunday that Labor would deliver an extra 500 hours of women\u2019s sport via the ABC if elected on 2 July.  Shorten said the initiative would \u201cinspire our future sporting heroes\u201d.    Labor will deliver an extra 500 hours of women's sport on Australian TV to inspire our future sporting heroes.https://t.co/8lSE1QuKhK\u2014 Bill Shorten (@billshortenmp) May 29, 2016    \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great sporting story of Australian women athletes but at the moment what happens is of all the sports coverage on television only 7% is of our women athletes\u201d Shorten said. \u201cWe believe that our women athletes deserve comparable coverage to our male athletes.\u201d The extra hours would be dedicated to live coverage of women\u2019s sports such as football and basketball, both of which have all disappeared from free-to-air television over recent years. The likes of football\u2019s Asian Cup, the women\u2019s cricket, basketball and hockey World Cups, and the Women\u2019s National Basketball League \u2013 all currently without a platform \u2013 are tournaments that could be picked up by the ABC with the extra funding. Shorten said the funds would go to financing live broadcasts on ABC television and its digital platforms, at a cost of $21m over a period of four years. \u201cIt was a real shame that under the Liberals in 2014, women\u2019s basketball and women\u2019s soccer disappeared from the television,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cI am pleased that soccer has come back with the Matildas, but the ABC funding cuts has inhibited this.\u201d Labor\u2019s communications spokesman, Jason Clare, said the new funding was not to be used to compete with commercial television stations, but rather to buy rights for events that had been passed on by the likes Foxtel, Channel Seven, Nine and Ten. On Sunday, Malcolm Turnbull announced the Coalition government would commit a further $60m into the Sporting Schools program, in a bid to combat falling participation rates during the transition from primary to high school. Football Federation Australia chief executive, David Gallop, was cautiously optimistic about the pledges from both parties. \u201cFFA welcomes today\u2019s election commitments, but urges both sides to increase funding to grassroots community football facilities,\u2019 Gallop said. \u201cIn particular, female players wanting to play have to be turned away in many Australian communities because of poor facilities or a lack of facilities. \u201cIt\u2019s important that sports funding takes a bottom-up as well as a top-down approach if young Australian female football players are to get the opportunities they deserve alongside their male counterparts.\u201d",
