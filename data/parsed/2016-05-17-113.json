  "body": "From Islington to Earl\u2019s Court, Peckham Rye to Ladbroke Grove, just about every area of London has a rich, historic literature of its own. Countless writers down the ages have sought to make some sense of this labyrinthine metropolis: Dickens wittily unravelled the social fabric of the Victorian era, Virginia Woolf perfected the modernist city symphony and Muriel Spark elevated the quirks of postwar working-class life to literary greatness. But the concept of the London novel is a strange and fluid thing, hard to define beyond its obvious geographical premise. So how might aspiring novelists set about penning a London masterpiece? For a recent Guardian Live event, Will Self, author of The Book of Dave; AL Kennedy, whose Serious Sweet is set for release this week, and Tony Parsons, bestselling author of Man and Boy, came together to share tips on how best to write about this city. You must know London ...     Will Self. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian    \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know the city,\u201d explained Self, who takes a rambling, psychogeographical approach to his work and clearly knows a thing or two about the capital. \u201cThe long view is essential for the city writer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must feel the shadow \u2026 feel your own evanescence.\u201d Amid multiple tangents and digressions, he touched on the repeal of the Test Acts, the history of municipal socialism in the city and nigh on 40 years of \u201cunrestrained neoliberal globalising bollocks\u201d, demonstrating a little of his own broad knowledge. He\u2019s an advocate of exploring the past and not getting overly bogged down in the the present day. \u201cYou can get a bit overexcited about the present, in my view,\u201d he said. ... but use an outsider\u2019s perspective     AL Kennedy. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    Of course, knowing London doesn\u2019t mean you have to have lived there all your life, nor does it necessarily require some kind of complete understanding. Kennedy seems in favour of an intimate, almost microcosmic line of action. \u201cSo much about London is about a very small view,\u201d she said, explaining that it was the likes of Spark\u2019s shabby and weird \u2013 but lovely \u2013 stories that initially attracted her to the city. Like Spark, Kennedy is Scottish, and she appears to use her outsider\u2019s vantage to observe and perceive things in a way that perhaps those who have long inhabited the city don\u2019t. Whether coming at things from a \u201cnewly-arrived\u201d or \u201chere-forever\u201d point of view, it stands to reason that a clear idea of what you want, or need, to say is integral. \u201cWhat\u2019s your focus?\u201d Kennedy asked. \u201cWhat kind of research are you doing? Is it present day? Is it past? What\u2019s resonating? What isn\u2019t resonating? It\u2019s a research project like any other research project, but it will also reflect what you feel is important about the world.\u201d For Serious Sweet, she explained, she recorded instances of kindness between strangers. \u201cLondon partly floats on those,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s almost intolerable without [them]\u201d.  Read your predecessors Familiarising yourself with your fellow London writers, be they novelists, essayists, poets or historians, is a given. Referring again to the importance of taking the long view, Self implored us to \u201clook at the great London writers of the past \u2026 De Quincey\u2019s Confessions of an English Opium-Eater \u2013 very much about man coming in and out of the city, coping with it, not coping with it, fucking up. Defoe\u2019s [A] Journal of the Plague Year, a very great early work of the psychogeography of the city \u2013 again, a similar sense of movement. Dickens, of course, Jack London\u2019s The People of the Abyss.\u201d These authors all make use of the perambulating approach adopted by Self, and they all drifted in and out of London. Avoid cliche \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a distinctly London novel,\u201d said Self, when asked what cliches of the genre should be given a wide berth. \u201cI think the city is so big and looms so large that you can treat it as a world entire, so it\u2019s the same problems that you have with any novel of place. Cliche is the endless enemy; whatever the cliche is, it has to be avoided.\u201d     Tony Parsons. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian    Parsons described how he cashed in his pension so he could take two years off to write his first crime novel, during which time he thought deeply about how to avoid London cliches \u2013 one of which, he said, is Scotland Yard. \u201cYou just have \u2026 to avoid anything that seems as though it\u2019s been done to death. My novels are set in West End Central because one of the first pieces of journalism that I ever did \u2026 was writing about the vice squad [there] \u2026 So I knew it and it seemed like a good way to swerve the cliche.\u201d And don\u2019t try to write a London novel With all its regional, generational and other contextual variations, perhaps a definition of the London novel beyond that basic \u2013 and arguably tenuous \u2013 geographical premise is impossible. As such, is it a mistake to set out to write one?  \u201cIdeally,\u201d Kennedy said, \u201cwhatever you\u2019re writing about, all of the parts of it will fit organically, and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 as a writer \u2026 if you were going to walk out of the building and get hit by a truck, you would have said the thing that burned within you that you had to say. And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to be a canonical novel, or it\u2019s going to be a London novel, or it\u2019s gong to be a woman-in-peril novel; it\u2019s going to be the thing that you have to write.\u201d \u2022 To find out about forthcoming Guardian Live events, sign up to become a Guardian Member.",
