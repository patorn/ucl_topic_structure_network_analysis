  "body": "Confusion reigned on Thursday over a possible debate between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. After kicking off a media frenzy by accepting an offer to debate Sanders, Trump changed his mind at least twice in the same day when pressed about whether he was serious about the prospect.  Addressing reporters on Thursday in his first press conference after crossing the threshold of delegates needed to become the Republican nominee, Trump reiterated his willingness to debate Sanders for charity to the tune of at least $10m.  This came after Trump\u2019s campaign said earlier in the day that the Republican was only joking when he first expressed his openness to debating Sanders during an appearance on ABC\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday.   Related: Why Bernie Sanders' movement is much larger than this election | Tony Karon    \u201cI\u2019d love to debate Bernie \u2013 he\u2019s a dream,\u201d Trump said at the press conference in Bismarck, North Dakota, on Thursday. \u201cThe problem with debating Bernie is he\u2019s gonna lose [the Democratic race] \u2026 but I\u2019d debate him anyway. We\u2019ve already had a couple of calls from the networks, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d He added: \u201cIf I debated him, we would have such high ratings, and I think we should take that money and give it to some worthy charity.\u201d Trump refused to take part in any further Republican debates after the Florida primary when the field winnowed down to three candidates. Sanders responded:    I am delighted that @realDonaldTrump has agreed to debate. Let\u2019s do it in the biggest stadium possible.\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 26, 2016    Trump\u2019s comments echoed his remarks to Kimmel in an interview the night before, when he told the late-night talkshow host: \u201cIf I debated him [Sanders], we would have such high ratings, and I think we should take that money and give it to some worthy charity.\u201d  Sanders, the leftwing senator from Vermont who is lagging behind Clinton in the delegate race to clinch the Democratic nomination, responded immediately in a tweet, writing:     Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 26, 2016    Sanders\u2019 campaign confirmed he was serious about the opportunity if Trump was, but an aide to Trump clarified on Thursday that the former reality TV star was joking and had no intention to actually debate Sanders.  A debate between candidates from both parties before the conclusion of the nominating process would have been highly unusual and a potential headache for Clinton, who turned down an invitation from Fox News to debate Sanders earlier this week \u2013 citing the need to shift gears toward the looming battle with Trump in November. \u201cWe believe that Hillary Clinton\u2019s time is best spent campaigning and meeting directly with voters across California and preparing for a general election campaign that will ensure the White House remains in Democratic hands,\u201d Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jen Palmieri said in a statement. A debate during the remainder of the primary season would indeed serve as more beneficial to Sanders, offering him another public platform to make his case in what has been a grueling contest against Clinton. The senator has often referred to poll numbers on the stump that show him faring better than Clinton in a hypothetical match-up against Trump, although Clinton has countered that she has spent more than two decades in the public eye whereas Sanders has yet to be vetted at the national level. Trump, although evidently unwilling to debate the senator, has made overtures toward Sanders\u2019 supporters by echoing their complaints that the establishment is working in Clinton\u2019s favor. \u201cThe system is rigged against him,\u201d Trump told Kimmel, referring to Sanders. \u201cI think it\u2019s very unfair.\u201d Sanders and Clinton last faced off on the debate stage on 9 March in Miami. Since then, Clinton has marched significantly closer to sealing the nomination but has still lost a series of contests to Sanders along the way. Sanders has routinely charged that the DNC, which remains officially neutral in the primary, is aiding Clinton by limiting debates and scheduling them on weekends when there would be less of an audience.  The senator\u2019s disdain for party leaders escalated last week, when Sanders said he would not reappoint Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chair of the DNC if elected president and endorsed her primary opponent as she seeks re-election to Congress in south Florida. Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist and founder of the center-left thinktank New Democrat Network, wrote in a column this week that the California debate should proceed as initially planned between Clinton and Sanders. \u201cFor the DNC to walk away from the debate now, given that Sanders has signaled his desire to proceed, will only confirm the worst suspicions of Sanders partisans,\u201d Rosenberg wrote.
