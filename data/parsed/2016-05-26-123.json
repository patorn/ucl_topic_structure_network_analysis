Much less attention has been paid to something equally significant: its contribution to Disney\u2019s ongoing project to empower and enable its pre-teen and early-teen girl audience. If you asked anyone a decade ago who would be leading the charge to engineer this kind of feminist social change \u2013 specifically, through influencing the narratives of mass-market blockbuster films \u2013 Disney would arguably be the bottom of the list. If anything, it was considered the most conservative of the major studios, with its series of fairytale cartoons playing a significant part in schooling generations of girls in the arts of home-making, dressing nicely and meeting Prince Charmings. Its live-action fare, likewise, conformed to a family-friendly model that relied on the likes of Pirates of the Caribbean, The Princess Diaries and The Chronicles of Narnia. Now, however, the picture is somewhat different. The impact of certain films has been dramatic: the 2012 Pixar animation Brave, set in a quasi-medieval Scotland; Frozen, the 2013 blockbuster loosely based on The Snow Queen; and the first Alice in Wonderland. All have featured self-reliant female protagonists for whom romantic love is not the endgame, in stories where male agency has been eliminated or largely sidelined. In effect, boyfriends have been replaced by mothers and sisters as thematic motors. Alice Through the Looking Glass follows the same model: perhaps even more noticeably so, considering that the central figure is 19 and attempting to forge a career as a merchant-naval trader in the far east.           Tim Burton on Alice Through the Looking Glass \u2013 video interview    Writer and activist Melissa Silverstein \u2013 founder and editor of the Women and Hollywood initiative \u2013 is arguably the most influential critic of gender issues in contemporary cinema. Is she on board with what Disney \u2013 in what is, admittedly, only a sliver of the company\u2019s total output \u2013 is trying to do? \u201cDisney has been giving us characters for decades that we, as a culture, can relate to,\u201d she says. \u201cWith Brave, and Frozen, and the Alice movies, feminist women are behind those things. That makes a difference. Disney makes other kinds of movies that don\u2019t necessarily fit into this category \u2013 so it\u2019s hard for me to say something extraordinary is happening across the board. \u201cWe have to interrupt the cycle that starts very young,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the power dynamic, that girls have to be saved. We want girls to be the heroes of the stories; they don\u2019t have to be saved. Girl characters need to be as fully fleshed out as male characters; they can\u2019t only be striving for romance. \u201cThey have to be individuals in the world, because that is what girls expect to see. And not only girls \u2013 we need boys to see these girls being characters that have backbone, so they understand in real life girls are equal.\u201d What Silverstein is alluding to, of course, is the studio\u2019s history with Disney Princesses; a branded concept that actually only dates from 2000, despite mining the company\u2019s eight-decade back catalogue. Disney Princesses \u2013 which encompasses toys, games, figurines and multiple fashion accessories \u2013 has been a huge money-spinner for the company, with an estimated revenue of more than $5.5bn, but the studio seems to be in retreat from the values it defined. Silverstein calls it \u201cthe princess-industrial complex\u201d and describes it as \u201calmost the downfall of civilisation\u201d. \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been teaching girls: wear pink, look pretty, wear makeup. I want that to go away. That is not stuff that helps girls become empowered young women. This is stuff people use to keep women docile.\u201d     Elsa from Disney\u2019s Frozen. Photograph: Allstar/DISNEY    According to a report by Bloomberg Businessweek writer Claire Suddath, about Disney\u2019s decision to switch its doll licence from Mattel to Hasbro, one of the key factors behind Disney\u2019s change of direction was the continued criticism from influential feminist writers: specifically Peggy Orenstein\u2019s 2006 article in the New York Times magazine What\u2019s Wrong with Cinderella? which detailed her disgust, as a mother, for the \u201cprincess craze and the girlie-girl culture\u201d that appeared to be swamping her daughter. But it seems Disney had been heading \u2013 slowly \u2013 in the desired direction for some time. The process is neatly summarised in Kaitlin Ebersol\u2019s 2014 essay How Fourth-Wave Feminism is Changing Disney\u2019s Princesses: the latest tranche of which, via Brave and Frozen \u201ccompletely cast off the patriarchal cliches of their predecessors by focusing heavily on the relationships between women and treating romance as a secondary consideration\u201d. The same is true of the Alice movies, and of the 2014 Sleeping Beauty reboot Maleficent (which shares a scriptwriter, Linda Woolverton, with Alice). The Cinderella remake, however, followed a more traditional, princessy route. No one is sure yet which way the new Beauty and the Beast will go, though the interest is certainly there (a recently released trailer broke internet records); but the participation of Emma Watson, whose plan to spend a year studying feminism has made headlines, does hint at the possibilities. Sweeping critiques are one thing; but how do the film-makers themselves deal with such issues? Suzanne Todd, producer of both Alice films (along with her sister, Jennifer) says that making a \u201cfemale empowerment piece\u201d was \u201cthe driving force, right from the beginning\u201d. Woolverton, she says, was a key figure in the project. Belle, a character created by Woolverton for the 1991 Beauty and the Beast cartoon, took \u201ca stand for what she believes in, and is her own person\u201d and now \u201cit\u2019s only become more important that we create characters that we\u2019re proud of, and that our own [daughters] can look up to and emulate\u201d. Todd also says that the lack of any romantic interest for the teenage Alice in both the 2010 and 2016 films isn\u2019t deliberate but that relationships with friends and family took priority. \u201cYou know, for girls who like boys, it\u2019s a big part of your life. We wanted to have something there, but there just wasn\u2019t room. We really wanted to take on the story with her mother: at that age, everyone is having to reinvent their relationship with their parents.\u201d The career troubles Alice experiences in 1875 are also of enduring relevance.

Photograph: Moviestore / Rex Features    Todd\u2019s film is only one piece of a larger cultural jigsaw, however. \u201cIt takes so long to make films, and so many people have to make decisions, they are five years behind,\u201d says Silverstein. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for people in the movie business to understand and embrace the role culture plays in how we look at our society.\u201d She points to the recent Twitter campaign to give Elsa a same-sex relationship in Frozen 2. \u201cCulture is about how we connect with each other, and if we leave out the type of women we are striving to be, girls won\u2019t see the role models for them to emulate. Disney has been pushing forward on issues our culture has been talking about and I think that\u2019s great, but that comes with responsibility too. \u201cThe film business has struggled with bringing in women\u2019s voices, and trusting them. That\u2019s why, when we get an exciting moment like a Brave, or a Frozen, we embrace it. It\u2019s shocking that we are having all these first moments. But the truth is, women create the characters of women they want to see, and that\u2019s why the films are successful.\u201d \u2022 Alice Through the Looking Glass is out on 27 May.",
