  "body": "The new artistic director of the Globe Theatre, Emma Rice, just won\u2019t toe the line. Not content with making some people very cross this week by daring to fill her production of a Shakespeare play \u2013 a Shakespeare, mind you \u2013 with \u201cblack and Asian faces\u201d (I\u2019m pretty sure black and Asian people were around 400 years ago), Rice has now further \u201criled the Shakespearean elite\u201d by suggesting that some people only pretend to enjoy Shakespeare, so as not to look stupid. It\u2019s hard to imagine who\u2019s shocked by that idea.   Related: 'It's time for a big adventure': Emma Rice on her opening Globe production    Because everybody does it, right? Show me one person who\u2019s never been stuck in the pub with a noisy expert and claimed to like things they don\u2019t really like \u2013 to look smarter, or to spare themselves the argument about why they\u2019re wrong \u2013 and I\u2019ll show you a person who probably doesn\u2019t go to the pub enough. The contagious pressure to pretend that we know about things we don\u2019t and like things we hate is exactly the kind of thing that stops people engaging with theatre: the feeling that, somehow, you haven\u2019t done your homework. That it\u2019s a club that\u2019s not for you. Some people are furious at the thought of Rice running a Shakespearean theatre when she has the temerity not to think he\u2019s the best thing since doctors stopped treating venereal diseases with leeches, as though she\u2019s not deliberately courting the rage of exactly those kinds of people. Rice is being deliberately controversial to make a point: a lack of prior knowledge or some reticence in her audience shouldn\u2019t be a barrier to them enjoying the work. Which is a good rule of thumb for all theatre, really \u2013 as Shakespeare is just the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019d bet good money that, right now, people up and down the country are pretending to understand:           Emma Rice introduces her first season at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe    Tom Stoppard: are you clever enough? Do you know what\u2019s on the front page if you Google Tom Stoppard? An article called \u201cAre you clever enough to watch a Tom Stoppard play?\u201d, as though every usher taking tickets should also be administering a short entrance exam, or checking your GCSE grades against a grid on the door like a \u201cyou must be above this height to ride\u201d sign. In a quote used in that article, Stoppard complains that people seeing his shows used to know who Goneril is and now don\u2019t, conflating intelligence with having read King Lear, as though the relationship between those two things isn\u2019t entirely spurious. (Tom Stoppard would like that because it\u2019s a maths joke, and therefore Very Clever Indeed.)    Some of my favourite people in the world love Chekhov so much they actually nearly cry when they talk about him    In one of the most wily marketing tactics I\u2019ve ever seen, Stoppard has talked about his audiences growing stupider until he\u2019s convinced people that anyone who doesn\u2019t like him doesn\u2019t Get It. So now people are reduced to trying to like him louder than each other, to prove to Tom Stoppard that they\u2019re clever. Even though I once watched him fail to use an automatic door. I quite like Tom Stoppard plays, but I do think it\u2019s worth remembering that, much like the girl I was at school with who had a bruised chin for six weeks because a boy she fancied told her to twist it round and round in her hand (true), not everyone who wants you to prove yourself to them deserves it. Harold Pinter: are you taking it too seriously? All the tense humour of Joe Orton but with more long, meaningful silences, the recent Jamie Lloyd production of The Homecoming was a great reminder that Pinter actually put lots of jokes in his plays. If you\u2019ve seen a Pinter and found it boring and slow, fair enough, plenty of people do, though there\u2019s also a chance that whoever directed the production you disliked might have been taking Pinter too seriously. Bluffer\u2019s guide to Pinter, for those who can\u2019t be bothered: likes a love triangle; well-known east Londoner and affair-haver; go heavy on the Pauses. Tell people Pinter loved a pause, nod sagely, and wait for them to nod back. Tick. That\u2019s Pinter nailed. George Bernard Shaw: it\u2019s not the handbaaag one Over the years, I\u2019ve heavily implied to lots of people that I\u2019ve read a fair bit of GBS. \u201cAh,\u201d I\u2019ve said wisely, probably holding some kind of drink, \u201cBernard Shaw.\u201d I have never once read a George Bernard Shaw play. I have however watched the musical My Fair Lady on VHS one and a half times. Tick. I also have a horrible feeling that I once, as a teenager, said \u201ca handbaaaag\u201d during a conversation about Bernard Shaw and \u2013 kindly or unkindly, depending on your view \u2013 nobody corrected me that \u201ca handbag\u201d is from Oscar Wilde. (I sometimes wonder how furious Oscar Wilde, a famous wit, would be if he knew that \u201ca handbag\u201d is one of his most quoted lines.) Chekhov: makes you want to eat the rich Some of my favourite people in the world love Chekhov so much they actually nearly cry when they talk about him. I\u2019ve only seen one of his plays and it made me want to eat the rich. Ultimately, a good production is make or break for even the best and most enduring writing, which is why people like Rice \u2013 people passionate about making fun, memorable, inclusive theatre \u2013 are vital. After all, if we don\u2019t make an effort to engage people, to meet them on their own terms, what\u2019s the point of us? We\u2019re not just competing with telly these days, you know. We\u2019re competing with Netflix.",
