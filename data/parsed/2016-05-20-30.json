  "body": "On 10 October 2014, the state of Oklahoma threw open the doors of its maximum-security McAlester prison to reporters \u2013 the Guardian among them \u2013 to show off its brand-new, state-of-the-art death chamber. The corrections department had invested $106,000 to create the perfect killing machine that deployed the latest advances in technology and science \u2013 ultra sound, heart and blood pressure monitors, digital intercom and cameras \u2013 to ensure painless and foolproof executions. It was an important moment for Oklahoma, which had much to prove. Six months previously the state had conducted one of the most revolting executions in recent history. It had strapped Clayton Lockett, a convicted murderer and rapist, to a gurney and over the next 43 minutes, proceeded to jab needles into him during which time he was witnessed writhing and groaning before he died. It was in the wake of the Lockett horror show that the Oklahoma corrections department invited us in that bright October morning, to demonstrate to us \u2013 and through us the world \u2013 that it had learned the lessons of that terrible event. In the future, Oklahoma would use a fail-safe system of checks and balances to ensure that it killed its prisoners with propriety and dignity. Fast forward to this week, and the grand jury report released on Thursday night. Its 106 pages tell a very different story.   Related: Oklahoma officials backed use of wrong drug in botched execution \u2013\u00a0grand jury    The report reveals that within days of the tour of the state\u2019s ultimate death chamber, state officials set in train a sequence of events that would lead to the execution of Charles Warner using entirely the wrong drug \u2013 without anyone even noticing. In late October 2014, the director of the department of corrections met with a licensed doctor and paramedic who formed the team that would place the IV tubes into Warner\u2019s veins through which he would be pumped with lethal drugs.  At the meeting, and in subsequent conversations, the director talked about the execution protocol and the drugs that were to be used, \u201cbut never provided the IV team leader [with] a written copy of the protocol\u201d. In fact, the paramedic told the grand jury that he had no idea what his role entailed until he was given hands-on training the day before Warner was to be put to death. Such was the paucity of preparation that he only realized his job was to help draw up the syringes on the day of the execution itself. The report goes on to describe how lethal injection drugs were obtained by the state for the Warner execution, a complicated job given the tight ethical boycott of US corrections departments imposed by pharmaceutical companies and governments. Under the old execution protocol, three Oklahoma officials were required to go in person with a written prescription to procure lethal injection drugs. In the Warner case, a senior corrections official identified only as \u201cWarden A\u201d ordered the drugs over the phone. In November 2014, only a month after the reporters\u2019 tour of the pristine death chamber, the anonymous pharmacist in turn duly ordered five cartons of the sedative midazolam and six cases of potassium chloride solution, a toxic chemical that stops the prisoner\u2019s heart. The pharmacist used a wholesalers\u2019 website to purchase the drugs, but in a mix-up ordered potassium acetate, a totally different chemical than the potassium chloride listed in the protocol. \u201cIn my head I was not thinking potassium chloride, because I was looking at it, going, it\u2019s potassium. Pharmacy brain versus probably a law brain, I guess,\u201d the pharmacist told the grand jury. For the next 27 pages, the grand jury report describes the journey of the wrong drugs from the pharmacist\u2019s premises into Warner\u2019s veins in surreal detail, reading like a passage out of Alice Through the Looking Glass. At every stage in the process, the glaring error in the lethal injection drugs was missed. On the morning of Warner\u2019s execution, \u201cAgent 1\u201d went to the pharmacist and picked up the lethal drugs. To do so the agent had to fill out an official form, but as it asked no questions about the drugs he blithely passed the package on. The box with the wrong drugs inside went to \u201cWarden A\u201d who opened it, removed the vials and lined them up to be photographed. As one of the much-vaunted checks and balances in the new system, he completed an \u201cexecution drugs\u201d form, noting that he had received 20 vials of midazolam and 12 of potassium acetate \u2013 he told the grand jury that he didn\u2019t realize that acetate was a mistake.

They did not notice that the vials were labeled potassium acetate rather than potassium chloride. \u201cI should have noticed it. I didn\u2019t notice it \u2026 I dropped the ball,\u201d the doctor told the grand jury. Then a four-person \u201cspecial operations team\u201d led by \u201cWarden A\u201d that is responsible for injecting the drugs into the condemned man arrived. They carefully verified that the labels on all the syringes read \u201cpotassium chloride\u201d, but did not compare them to the labels on the vials. Warner was pronounced dead on 7.28pm on 15 January 2015, having been injected with the mistaken potassium acetate. Before he died, Warner was overheard by the Associated Press saying \u201cmy body is on fire.\u201d In the ensuing hours and days after the execution, numerous other state officials reviewed the death of Warner. They included \u201cWarden A\u201d, the director of Oklahoma corrections, officials who conducted an inventory of Warner\u2019s body bag, a medical autopsy team, a corrections manager who completed a \u201cquality assurance review\u201d, the full board of corrections and the staff of the governor\u2019s office. None of them detected any problem. The penny only dropped eight months after Warner was executed, when the state was preparing to kill its next prisoner, Richard Glossip. Just as before, \u201cWarden A\u201d opened up the package of drugs but this time did notice the discrepancy with the labels. He decided not to tell anybody about the mistake. It was only when the IV team separately noticed the discrepancy that alarm bells were finally sounded, and Glossip\u2019s execution put on hold.  Having uncovered such a litany of errors, the grand jury struck an unsurprisingly stern tone in its conclusions. The pharmacist was negligent, \u201cWarden A\u201d failed to do his job, the way the drugs were obtained was \u201cquestionable at best\u201d, while most of the prison staff involved in the execution misunderstood their own rules. It was an extraordinary rebuke, all the more so because it was made so soon after the spectacle of the state-of-the-art death chamber. It leaves Oklahoma, and by extension all of the death penalty states clinging to this brutal form of punishment, facing an awkward question: can protocols that depend on human interpretation, and thus are vulnerable to human error, ever be trusted in as grave a matter as the taking of a man\u2019s life?",
