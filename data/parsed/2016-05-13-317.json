  "body": "Parents of students at a Bendigo high school have been urged to support a former pupil ejected from a school church service over his \u201cinappropriate\u201d outfit. The student, Angus McCormack, says Girton Grammar discriminated against him at the private Christian school\u2019s Foundation Day service last Friday. McCormack \u2013 who was a captain of the school in 2013 \u2013 attended the event as a guest of his father, Chris, a board member. He said he was asked to leave by the deputy headmaster after arriving at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, where theannual event was held.

McCormack wrote on Facebook on Thursday that his father had been asked to ensure that he \u201cwear appropriate attire\u201d. In his post he said he was \u201copenly gay\u201d and known for his \u201coften \u2018bold\u2019 choices of fashion\u201d. \u201cI was originally considering rocking a dress and some killer heels! However, I decided to \u2018tone down\u2019 my appearance and be respectful to their wishes.\u201d He said he wore \u201cminimal makeup\u201d, a single small earring, black leather pants, a white shirt with a black bow tie and black jacket. \u201cA suit by any definition of the word,\u201d he wrote, \u201calthough not in the typical commercial fabrics.\u201d McCormack posted a photograph of his outfit, \u201cif you wish to make your own judgement on what you think is \u2018appropriate or inappropriate\u2019.\u201d His father resigned from the school\u2019s board this week as a result of his son\u2019s exclusion from the service. McCormack wrote on Facebook that he had received \u201coutstanding\u201d support from people who felt he had been treated unfairly but had had no contact from the school. He asked sympathisers to express their concerns directly to the headmaster. \u201cHe needs to hear that the community does not condone this intolerable behaviour in our society today.\u201d His post had been met with a considerable response, with more than 13,000 likes, 3,700 comments and 4,150 shares since it was published on Thursday. McCormack \u2013 whose Facebook profile states he is a student of RMIT university in Melbourne \u2013 has been contacted for comment. In a statement Girton Grammar headmaster, Matthew Maruff, said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d at how McCormack felt about the situation and was happy to talk with him. \u201cWhilst this situation is regrettable, it is an issue of dress code for occasion and institution, not one of sexual discrimination,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt no time, past or present, has Angus been discriminated against on grounds of sexuality in any way by Girton Grammar School. \u201cAngus was informed that his choice of attire was inappropriate for a guest of a member of the official party. \u201cAngus may have felt that he had no choice but to leave. His quick departure left no opportunity for an alternative outcome to be achieved.\u201d David McCubbin, who has two children at the school, told Guardian Australia the school board\u2019s refusal to apologise to McCormack went \u201cto the core of ignorance, intolerance and bigotry\u201d. \u201cWhen a board cannot realise their intransigence, the school community suffers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing.\u201d He had written to the headmaster to complain, stating that: \u201cGirton is better than this\u201d. \u201cThe board and senior management need to grasp the enormity of their mistake.\u201d McCubbin wrote that his own school in Melbourne had \u201ctolerated an eccentric, flamboyant, and enthusiastic student, who would push the boundaries of dress, convention and what passed for acceptable behaviour ...
