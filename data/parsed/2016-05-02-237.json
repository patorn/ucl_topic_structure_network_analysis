  "body": "Spoiler alert: this blog is published after Game of Thrones airs on HBO in the US on Sunday night and on Foxtel in Australia on Monday afternoon. Do not read unless you have watched season six, episode two, which airs in the UK on Sky Atlantic on Monday at 9pm, and is repeated in Australia on Showcase on Monday, at 7.30pm AEST.  \u2018The great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie \u2026 you were right all along\u2019   Related: Game of Thrones recap: season six, episode one \u2013 The Red Woman    Let\u2019s get the most obvious bit out of the way first \u2013 Jon Snow is not dead (sometimes I wonder if this season might force me to start every week writing Jon Snow is dead, Jon Snow is not dead until a giant conveniently arrives to put me out of my misery). Judging by early reaction to the episode not everyone is happy with that plot twist after weeks of (fairly unconvincing) denials from cast and crew, but I\u2019m actually OK with Jon being brought back to life by Melisandre. Firstly, he might be a bit morose but he\u2019s also one of the few characters acting for largely honourable purposes and in a week when this show fed a woman and her newborn baby to the dogs we all need something to cling on to. Secondly, his resurrection didn\u2019t come out of nowhere: there\u2019s precedent for it thanks to the season three plot line with Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr. It\u2019s also worth noting that when Thoros told Melisandre about bringing Beric back to life he stated he had said the words in desperation, adding \u201cI have no power. I ask the Lord for His favour, and He responds as He will.\u201d Similarly, for all Davos\u2019s (rather touching) faith in her witchy abilities, Melisandre\u2019s ceremony wasn\u2019t truly working until the moment she said \u201cplease\u201d. There\u2019s also the question about those old resurrection dues \u2013 bargains with deities, no matter how heartfelt, always come with a price. Back in season three Beric told Arya: \u201cEvery time I come back \u2026 I\u2019m a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away,\u201d and I think it would be a mistake to think Jon Snow Reborn will be the same man he was before.    Related: Game of Thrones premiere: forget Jon Snow \u2013 we need to talk about Melisandre    \u2018I prefer being an only child\u2019 The return of Jon Snow aside, I\u2019m still in two minds about both this episode and this season so far. This was a week packed full of shocking moments, unexpected deaths and the sense the very last of the old guard were falling and a new game coming into play but at the same time some questionable plotting decisions are being made. Last week it was the move to kill off Doran Martell in favour of irritating girl band manqu\u00e9 the Sand Snakes; this week it was the removal of Roose Bolton by his son Ramsay. I don\u2019t doubt Ramsay was both astute enough and panicky enough to kill his father the minute he learnt there was a new heir but it\u2019s also the case that I don\u2019t find the character as fascinating as David Benioff and DB Weiss clearly do. In fact I couldn\u2019t help wishing the confrontation had played out the other way round: I\u2019ve always preferred the cold calculation of Roose, a man who, like Tywin Lannister, made cruel decisions for entirely pragmatic and thus far more scary reasons to the more crude psychopathy of a Joffrey or a Ramsay. Roose had a sense of purpose, however wrong, when he plotted against people \u2013 Ramsay is just a monster. There\u2019s nothing particularly interesting about that and nowhere particularly interesting for the character to go. As to the scene with Walda \u2013 again it was absolutely in character that Ramsay would feed his stepmother and her child to the dogs but I didn\u2019t really feel I gained much from seeing him spell it out. I should probably just be grateful that they chose not to show the actual moment she and her baby were torn to bits.     Isaac Hempstead Wright as Bran Stark on Game of Thrones. Photograph: HBO    \u2018I am the storm, brother, the first storm and the last, and you\u2019re in my way\u2019 Thank goodness then for Pilou Asbaek\u2019s Euron Greyjoy who rocked up on a suitably dark and stormy night (and I do love how the weather conditions in Pyke are always wet, overcast and miserable, it makes me feel quite at home) to dispatch his older brother Balon to a watery grave while uttering gnomic phrases with appropriate menace. Clearly Euron is pitching to be this season\u2019s Oberyn Martell: a charismatic scene-stealer with a pithy turn of phrase and a hidden agenda. What are his true intentions beyond winning the Kingsmoot? Can Yara defeat him or will her ambition flounder on the hard rocks of Iron Island patriarchy? What about Theon \u2013 I can\u2019t help feeling the youngest Greyjoy may find himself hugely regretting that touching decision to head for home. One thing is certain, however: after two brief scenes I care more about the upcoming events on Pyke Island than I managed in an entire season in Dorne.  Additional thoughts   Related: Game of Thrones: will mini characters conquer viewers' hearts? | Media Monkey     Welcome back, Bran. I\u2019m enjoying your Max von Sydow-guided vision quest \u2013 it\u2019s a clever way of filling the audience in on the back-story and there was a lovely wistfulness to visions of Winterfell past. Plus Hodor, or should I say Willis, got to speak. Hurrah.  Anyone else think that the (I presume) children of the forest had more than a whiff of Narnia about them? I\u2019m sure some enterprising salesman is making: \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I drink and I know things\u201d T-shirts as we speak. They\u2019re also probably knocking up Bernie Sanders/High Sparrow shirts with the words: \u201cEvery one of us is poor and powerless and yet together we can overthrow an empire\u201d emblazoned on them. If not, they should be \u2013 the revolution will be commercialised. I\u2019m not sure what it says about Game of Thrones that we\u2019re essentially rooting for the corrupt, decadent aristocrats to see off the struggling poor but I liked Jaime\u2019s scene with the High Sparrow. There\u2019s always been an interesting fatalism about Jaime, a sense that he\u2019s half in love with death, and this was a nice little reminder of that. Poor old Tommen, he\u2019s trying hard but his chances of making it through the season are looking increasingly dim. At least the question about where Trystane died was answered: in the boat in the harbour of King\u2019s Landing meaning the sand snakes must have snuck onboard. The scene with Tyrion and the dragons was nicely done \u2013 and no doubt caused a thousand \u201cTyrion is Targaryen\u201d theories to spark back into life. I also liked the little moment between Brienne and Sansa when they discussed Arya. I\u2019m really rooting for these two (and Pod), which means sadly they\u2019re all doomed. Talking of Arya, hopefully this means the Jedi training is now, finally, going to move on. I thought Carice van Houten was particularly good this week. It\u2019s interesting to see Melisandre\u2019s vulnerability to the fore. Finally, I\u2019m not really convinced by Yara\u2019s ability. She has a tendency to make these fantastically overblown statements of intent \u2013 I\u2019m going to bring my brother home, I\u2019m going to avenge my father\u2019s death, I\u2019m going to rule the ironborn \u2013 but something of a problem with the followthrough.

All    Violence count A particularly violent episode saw several killed at Castle Black, one drunken boaster get his head smashed in by Ser Gregorstein, another beating for Arya, the murder of Roose Bolton and the subsequent tearing to death of his wife and newborn child, and the end of Balon Greyjoy, who learnt exactly why it\u2019s never a good idea to attempt to challenge a mysterious stranger on a swaying bridge in the dark. Random Irishman of the week So farewell then Michael McElhatton aka Roose Bolton. You were my favourite villain and your softly spoken but highly devious plotting will be much missed. So what did you think? Were you shocked by Jon\u2019s revival? What about Roose\u2019s death? Does Tyrion have a plan beyond free the dragons? And did the arrival of Euron Greyjoy make you interested in what\u2019s happening in Pyke?  As ever, all speculation and no spoilers are welcome below \u2026",
