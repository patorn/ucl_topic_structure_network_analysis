  "body": "Louis van Gaal arrived at Manchester United\u2019s training ground on Monday morning as his reign at Manchester United drew to a close. The Dutchman arrived at around 8.45am, his Mercedes sweeping into the Carrington training ground. The renowned lawyer Paul Gilroy QC, who works for the League Managers Association, also arrived soon after, initially being denied entry to the training ground. The club has announced that an announcement will be made at 1pm BST, when the New York Stock Exchange opens for business. United also have some shares on the Frankfurt exchange, which briefly opened up 2.4% higher before falling to 2.6% lower than their opening price. Ryan Giggs, United\u2019s most decorated player and assistant to Van Gaal, was seen leaving the training ground shortly after Van Gaal\u2019s arrival, fuelling speculation that he could also leave the club. Two years ago the Dutchman\u2019s predecessor, David Moyes, attended an early-morning meeting with the executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward at the training complex and a statement confirming the Scot\u2019s sacking followed shortly afterwards, just 10 months into a six-year deal to replace Sir Alex Ferguson.

United have steadfastly refused to comment while the Portuguese kept his counsel when asked about the job before David Haye\u2019s fight at London\u2019s O2 Arena on Saturday evening. Van Gaal stood firm when asked about his position in the post-match press conference at Wembley, but told a reporter on Sunday outside the team\u2019s London hotel that \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d. Gilroy, who has represented the former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and England\u2019s Roy Hodgson in the past, has been described as a \u201ctenacious and personable\u201d lawyer who \u201cis renowned for getting a fantastic deal for managers\u201d.    LMA lawyer Gilroy was refused entry shortly after 0930 & drove off. But he returned 0944 & was let straight in #MUFC pic.twitter.com/YGC19kZxRL\u2014 David Ornstein (@bbcsport_david) May 23, 2016    Van Gaal still has a season remaining on his three-year contract, while Mourinho has been out of work since paying for Chelsea\u2019s abysmal title defence with his job in December. The Portuguese has repeatedly spoken of his plan to return to work this summer, and reviving United\u2019s fortunes would be a mouth-watering proposition.   Related: Louis van Gaal tactics left Manchester United players close to mutiny | Daniel Taylor    United, a club synonymous with a swashbuckling, attacking style, managed a paltry 49 league goals \u2013 their lowest return for 26 years \u2013 and missed out on Champions League qualification to neighbours Manchester City on goal difference. A first FA Cup win since 2004 was a welcome boost, but Wayne Rooney knows the campaign was far from good enough. \u201cHe has been under pressure. I think we all have,\u201d the captain said of Van Gaal. \u201cThat\u2019s part of playing for Manchester United and managing Manchester United \u2013 it is a massive club. You have to set standards and we fell below them this season. But we have to make sure as players we get back to those standards and make sure we are back challenging for the main trophies.\u201d Success is something the former United midfielder and Chelsea assistant coach Ray Wilkins is backing Mourinho to bring back to Old Trafford. \u201cI think it is the right move,\u201d he told Talksport. \u201cIt is the only move for them. He will get them playing again and he will get them winning again. He is a winner \u2013 there is no two ways about it. When he goes to a club, normally he wins a big trophy within the first couple of years.\u201d",
