  "body": "Kelechi Iheanacho believes nothing should be read into Manchester\u2019s City\u2019s humbling defeat by Southampton as they prepare for their return Champions League tie against Real Madrid. The teenage striker scored twice as City went down 4-2 at St Mary\u2019s Stadium but is unlikely to be in the starting line-up on Wednesday after he was one of the eight changes Manuel Pellegrini made to the side who drew 0-0 in the first leg. Joe Hart, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Fernandinho stayed in the team but Vincent Kompany, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and possibly Yaya Tour\u00e9, who is back in training after a thigh strain, are likely to be leading the team at the Bernab\u00e9u. Asked whether being beaten by Saints would damage City\u2019s confidence, Iheanacho said: \u201cIt is not a big blow because we have played now and we need to focus on the next game against Madrid so we put this game behind us. We lost quite well but we put it behind us and focus on Madrid and come back stronger.\u201d He admitted it was not an ideal result but added: \u201cThis game is not good preparation for us but we will keep it behind us, focus and train and go to the Bernab\u00e9u and hope we qualify. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a distraction,\u201d he said of the Saints game. \u201cWe need to keep it behind us and work hard in training and go there and fight for the final.\u201d The Nigerian is likely to be on the bench as City aim to make the final for the first time with Ag\u00fcero returning up front but at the moment he is content to simply be included in the squad. \u201cIt is a dream come true for me and I am happy if I go there and I hope we do well and there is a great atmosphere there. I haven\u2019t been there before but I am happy to go there to get a win. \u201cIt is going to be a big challenge for us but we will keep our heads down and keep working hard to get there.\u201d Was it his dream to get the winner at the Bernab\u00e9u? \u201cYeah if I play I need to work hard for the team and help them qualify for the finals if we get the goals.\u201d",
