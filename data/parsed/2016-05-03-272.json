There\u2019s no doubt that there are a lot of male engineers, but as a woman, I\u2019ve never been treated any differently. In fact, I\u2019ve had a lot of support.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until an MBDA apprentice spoke about engineering at her school that Aspinall considered it as a career. And she was one of the lucky ones who were made aware of it as an option.     Jade Aspinall, manufacturing engineer at MBDA    There\u2019s no telling how many women who could have made successful engineers never even considered it as a career option, but there must be plenty out there. Just 9% of the engineering workforce and 6% of registered engineers and technicians are female. That is the lowest percentage of female engineering professionals in Europe, way behind the leaders, Latvia, Bulgaria and Cyprus, with nearly 30%. So what\u2019s stopping the UK\u2019s women going into engineering? Nothing physical \u2013 in fact, lots of schemes encourage them, says Dawn Bonfield, materials engineer and chief executive of the Women\u2019s Engineering Society, including big employers such as British Gas, Network Rail and Crossrail. What\u2019s holding them back is a lack of knowledge of what engineering is, and a lack of advice. At the moment, Bonfield says, women are making it in the engineering world, but they tend to be the ones who are absolutely determined to do so. \u201cWe call them the Stem [science, technology, engineering or maths] devotees, and they will make it, no matter what,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re determined to reach those women who might not have even considered engineering as a career. \u201cEngineering is a brilliant choice for women who want to do something, who have a big social conscience, and who want to change the world. It has just as much to offer as the \u2018traditional\u2019 professions such as law and medicine. It\u2019s about making the world more sustainable and more renewable. There are fantastic challenges out there, and women are using engineering as a way of finding solutions.\u201d    Engineering is a brilliant choice for women who want to do something, who want to change the world  Dawn Bonfield, Women's Engineering Society     What needs to be done to encourage more women into the sector? Schemes such as MBDA\u2019s are making a start. The company has achieved a 50/50 gender split within its engineering apprenticeships, something which spokesman Conal Walker attributes in part to the requirements of its outreach programme. Any school that wants an MBDA apprentice to give a talk must ensure that the audience has that 50/50 split too. It\u2019s a figure that bucks the national trend, where just 7.4% of engineering apprenticeship starters in 2013-14 were female. Bonfield wants the message around engineering to change to something far more positive. \u201cIt\u2019s about applying a thought process to make things better,\u201d she says, \u201cwhether that\u2019s designing a nuclear power station or getting clean water to people in development countries.\u201d But she wants to see far more careers information to back that message up, and an independent careers service for engineering to help unpick what can be a confusing choice of courses. Aspinall agrees. \u201cEngineering is such a broad church,\u201d she says. \u201cThere needs to be much more awareness about the range of careers. Everything in the room where I\u2019m sitting has been engineered. It\u2019s a job for life. It gives you transferable skills, it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s making things bigger and better as new technology comes along.\u201d Pensuree: \u2018I got my first taste for engineering aged 11\u2019     Pensuree Wallis, a trainee engineer at Eurostar. Photograph: Daniel Lynch    Pensuree Wallis, 19, had always wanted to make things work better, so engineering was a natural fit for her. \u201cI love mechanical and electrical work, and I think that\u2019s what made me go into engineering,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I was also really attracted to the fact that you could do apprenticeships and gain hands-on experience while getting recognised qualifications.\u201d Wallis is in her fourth year of an apprenticeship at Eurostar International, which she began just four days after her 16th birthday. She had her first taste of engineering there when she undertook work experience in year 11. \u201cI really enjoyed it,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone made me feel comfortable. There were so many people who were really clever and could teach me. And there were female engineers, which really grabbed me. So I applied for an apprenticeship, and got it.\u201d    Not many people at school said they wanted to do an apprenticeship. My choice shocked people  Pensuree Wallis     Apprenticeships weren\u2019t talked about much at her school, she says, and her teachers and friends were surprised at her choice. \u201cIt was assumed that you would stay on at school or go to college. Not many people said they wanted to do an apprenticeship. It shocked people, but I think they\u2019re used to it now.\u201d During her first year, she studied full-time at college, then one day a week subsequently. The rest of her time is spent at work. \u201cMy college studies are really relevant to what I\u2019m doing at work, especially on the electronics side,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, I\u2019ve had projects at work which involve making test boxes. So I\u2019ll make a circuit board and it will go in a test box which will connect to a train component. That way you can see whether it\u2019s faulty or not. The work-life-study balance is challenging but my employers have been great: if I need a day to do college work, they\u2019re fine with that.\u201d   Related: Want a plan for how to get more women into engineering? It's easy    She hasn\u2019t just gained engineering sector skills, either. \u201cYou learn to be in a workplace,\u201d Wallis says. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that experience of working in a team at university. Every year, we do specific team-building exercises designed to help us develop into better apprentices.\u201d Wallis will shortly gain her higher apprenticeship qualification, and will then start a degree in general engineering, also funded by Eurostar. She says women should seek out engineering apprenticeship opportunities. \u201cWhen I first wanted to become an engineer, I found it a bit daunting. But as soon as I was in that environment, I realised that there wasn\u2019t anything to be worried about. You\u2019re part of the team and you have just the same opportunities as everyone else. So go for it!\u201d  Interview by Lucy Jolin Casey: \u2018People were shocked when I said I wanted to become a marine engineer\u2019 Casey Keenan, 20, is a marine engineering apprentice with Team One Engineering in Southampton, which provides services to the marine and industrial sectors for the maintenance and overhaul of diesel and gas engines. As part of her apprenticeship, Keenan is studying towards an NVQ level 3 in marine engineering, and attends City College Southampton\u2019s Marine Skills Centre once a week.     Casey Keenan, a trainee marine engineer at Team One Engineering. Photograph: Simon J Evans for the Guardian    \u201cI was quite academic at school and I actually got 16 GCSEs, so a lot of people were quite shocked when I said I wanted to become a marine engineer,\u201d Keenan says. \u201cApprenticeships were mentioned but it wasn\u2019t really talked about that much and it was assumed I\u2019d go to university \u2013 but I just wanted to get out there and work. \u201cI did look for an apprenticeship straight out of school but it was a bit nerve-racking going from school to a full-time job, so I didn\u2019t pass the interviews. I decided to go to the Marine Skills Centre for a year at first and got a level one in marine engineering, and then I got my apprenticeship after that.\u201d As a youngster, Keenan says she was always one of those kids who wanted to be anything she saw on TV. \u201cAt one point I wanted to be a police officer, then I wanted to join the army, then I wanted to be a vet, even a professional ice skater. That all changed when I was introduced to engineering. I just love getting hands-on with a task, and I really got into it.\u201d Keenan did the first two years of her apprenticeship at a different company, but was able to transfer to her current employer without having to start again. It\u2019s something that taught her about the kind of work she wanted to do, she says. \u201cBecause my first company dealt with new builds, all the engines were under warranty, so we weren\u2019t allowed to touch them.\u201d  \u201cI wanted to be more hands-on with them, so the college put me in touch with Team One, and now I couldn\u2019t be happier. I recently had to do a refit on one of the Red Funnel car ferries, which was something I really enjoyed.\u201d    At the end of the day, an engine is still an engine, so I can go anywhere in the world  Casey Keenan     Keenan finishes her apprenticeship in June 2017 and wants to start travelling right away. \u201cOne thing I really like about engineering is that I never know what job I\u2019m going to be on, or where I\u2019m going to be. I could get asked to go to another site, or work on a different project, which is really exciting. I haven\u2019t been any further than Kent yet, though! \u201cAt my first placement I had the chance to go to Korea to work on a project, but my passport was out of date and I couldn\u2019t go. I made sure I renewed it straight away, so if anything else comes up, there\u2019ll be no stopping me. \u201cOnce finished, I\u2019ll have a trade which is needed everywhere, so even though I\u2019m doing marine engineering, at the end of the day, an engine is still an engine, so I can go anywhere in the world.\u201d  Interview by Allison Dickinson Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents \u2013 and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter",
