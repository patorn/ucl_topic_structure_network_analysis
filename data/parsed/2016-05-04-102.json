  "body": "Colin Bryce, business technology advisor at Cobry, explains why Rowan Manson should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:  From his first day working at Cobry, Rowan has shown diligence and insight every day to accelerate the growth of the business. He has demonstrated a willingness to question existing practice and establish new methods that has benefitted the company greatly \u2013 our new billing processes are a good example.  Particularly valuable for an SME is the initiative and attention-to-detail that he demonstrates every day \u2013 the technology we manage for clients is critical to their operation so his focus has been invaluable.  Such initiative has been a great positive for me \u2013 as the business owner, it\u2019s unusual to get useful ideas and solutions from someone so early in their career. We hope that Rowan\u2019s future lies at Cobry but whatever the future holds, his approach to work will only lead to good things.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
