  "body": "When is a \u201cgaffe\u201d really a gaffe, the kind of unguarded remark that causes legitimate offence, damages good causes and leaves its author permanently scarred by their own behaviour? Not as often as gaffe-seeking media would have us believe as they cheerfully eavesdrop on private conversations. David Cameron\u2019s \u201cmost corrupt countries\u201d remark about Nigeria and Afghanistan, made to the Queen and picked up by ever more sophisticated TV cameras, is a complex example of the genre. It is obviously true, but also undiplomatic on the eve of an anti-corruption conference which Cameron is hosting. Convenient offence was taken.  But it also begs larger questions, for instance about how these two countries are so corruptly governed \u2013 the curse of oil wealth a major factor in Nigeria, endless war and religious hypocrisy in Afghanistan. The usual suspects cannot blame outside forces for all of it. Corruption often reflects ancient traditions which Nigeria\u2019s recycled new broom of a president is committed to stamping out. In any case, how much is Britain in a position to lecture anyone when it and its oceanic micro-territories launder so much of the world\u2019s dirty money in the London property market and elsewhere? A trenchant Guardian editorial makes the point on Wednesday morning. The same defence might be offered in response to accusations of Chinese rudeness \u2013 also picked up by a camera pool at Buck House \u2013 during President Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to Britain last October. Even Her Maj ventured an opinion \u2013 \u201cvery rude\u201d \u2013 as top cops made small talk about their own experience. Chinese diplomats might be tempted to recall that Prince Charles routinely snubs (\u201csnub\u201d is like \u201cgaffe\u201d, a word mainly used in headlines) big Chinese events \u2013 can anyone remember why? \u2013 while the Queen\u2019s consort made \u201cslitty eyed\u201d jokes on his last Chinese tour in 1986. Come to think of it, what about those \u201cNo Dogs or Chinese\u201d signs in parks during China\u2019s century of humiliation or the drug-peddling achievements of the British empire in the opium wars? The truth of the matter is that the Chinese leaders are sensitive to slight, but also tough and confident characters. They are busy buying up handy bits of Britain that aren\u2019t nailed down (and some that are) and will make a fuss if it suits them, none if it doesn\u2019t. Compared with that on/off deal over the Hinkley Point nuclear plant, it\u2019s trivia. One obvious further point in mitigation is that Cameron\u2019s remark \u2013 like his \u201cQueen purred down the line\u201d remark to New York\u2019s mayor Michael Bloomberg after Scotland voted no to independence \u2013 wasn\u2019t intended to become public. Careless, even discourteous, it may have been (he went to Eton), but it was picked up by a roving microphone, much as private documents are sometimes filmed with long lenses as ministers enter Downing Street. None of it is exactly Pulitzer-prize-winning journalism. Some of it is even interesting, lifting the lid off excess secrecy and allowing editors of TV\u2019s rolling news \u2013 which prizes pictures above thought \u2013 to have a lazy day. No one is really surprised to hear what Cameron thinks about corruption in Nigeria.  Nor were we astonished to overhear a tetchy Gordon Brown calling Rochdale\u2019s Gillian Duffy a \u201cbigoted woman\u201d for raising her immigration concerns during the 2010 election before looking for an aide to blame for the experience. Unpleasant though it was, it merely confirmed what voters already knew about the darker side of their high-minded PM\u2019s character. His better side was on display talking about tax havens on Wednesday. It all serves to underline the inadequacy of the definition of a political gaffe made by the egghead American journalist Michael Kinsley, who argued that a gaffe occurs when a politician voices an obvious truth they were not supposed to utter. More weight is given to it because it\u2019s \u201cwhat he/she REALLY thinks\u201d, said Kinsley. That may not be true. In variations on that notion it is sometimes said that the gaffe lies in inattention to the full consequences of saying something one believes but doing so deliberately. Both Mitt Romney, whom Barack Obama defeated in 2012, and earlier Obama himself, made significant gaffes that way. The multimillionaire Romney was caught in a \u201csecret video\u201d (rival campaigns engage in such espionage here too) suggesting that 47% of voters, the ones not taking responsibility for their own lives, would vote Democrat for the government to take care of them.  That was a shocking thing to say, though US conservatives professed to be equally appalled in 2008 when the candidate Obama spoke of economically embittered voters whose vision of the American Dream had boiled down to \u201cguns or religion \u2026 anti-immigrant sentiment\u201d. Different people will take different sides on that one.   Related: Oliver Burkeman: George Bush's gaffes, gibberish, and gurning    True or not, both were politically damaging, as the Australian ex-PM Tony Abbott\u2019s muddling of \u201csuppository\u201d for \u201crepository\u201d or George W Bush\u2019s famous blunders (\u201cworking hard to put food on your family\u201d) were not. Princeton-educated Bush was shrewd enough to use them to endear himself to voters who felt laughed at themselves by \u201celites\u201d. Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201ckiller trees\u201d line was comic but more serious: he resisted environmental reforms. But it resonated with many, as do some of Donald Trump\u2019s more egregious statements and Boris Johnson\u2019s buffoonery in the Brexit debate. Playing fast and loose with the facts as \u201celitist\u201d is part of the populist repertoire, a dangerous one. But it is not going to go away. The current wave of populist politics, mostly nationalistic and xenophobic, predates the rise of interactive social media, Twitter and the rest, 24/7 rolling news and a camera with audio facilities in every voter\u2019s pocket. In the hands of the unscrupulous, thieves as well as demagogues, tech is a force for bad as well as good. When Churchill made his \u201cLabour Gestapo\u201d broadcast in the 1945 election, that was not a gaffe, but a bad political miscalculation. John Major\u2019s EU cabinet \u201cbastards\u201d remark was true, but inconveniently caught by a mic. Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system for official business may (or may not?) have been to protect diplomatic secrets, but the way she tried to deflect questions may prove a fatal gaffe. \u201cEverything is on the record now,\u201d younger MPs told me when I protested at the Daily Telegraph\u2019s entrapment of Vince Cable in his constituency surgery. Older MPs were shocked and outraged, but their younger colleagues are more right than wrong.  It wouldn\u2019t happen in secretive and authoritarian China? That\u2019s a big 21st-century question: for better and worse, it may be unstoppable.",
