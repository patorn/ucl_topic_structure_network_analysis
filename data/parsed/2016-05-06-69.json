  "body": "1 Skepta doesn\u2019t need Drake to make a classic  The last couple of years have seen Canadian megastar Drake declaring his love for grime, from Instagramming stills of Top Boy accompanied by slightly cack-handed renditions of UK slang (\u201creal bod man\u201d) to sneaking off from the Brits to appear on stage with fast-rising rap/grime outfit Section Boyz. When the rapper signed to Skepta\u2019s label Boy Better Know, fans relished seeing the two artists working together; as it turns out neither has appeared on the other\u2019s latest release. There was a disgruntled backlash from grime fans when Skepta wasn\u2019t given so much as a verse on Drake\u2019s recent album, Views, but now Skepta\u2019s returned the favour by keeping Konnichiwa Drizzy free, at no great loss. In fact, \u201cDrake signing to Boy Better Know\u201d is looking increasingly like a piece of pub quiz trivia in grime history.    Related: Ivor Novellos give nod to grime artist Skepta as Adele overlooked    2 There\u2019s not much love for Dizzee Rascal  Last year a monosyllabic Skepta sat through an interview with clueless US hip-hop personality Peter Rosenberg. The nadir came when Rosenberg asked him if he\u2019d received any \u201csage advice\u201d from \u201ctrue grime OG\u201d Dizzee Rascal. Seeming unimpressed, Skepta claimed to have no relationship with the MC. Dizzee, meanwhile, responded in his own interview, also with Rosenberg, claiming that he went way back with Skepta. Fans have already been speculating that recent single Man (Gang) was Skepta\u2019s thinly veiled response to Dizzee. On the track Lyrics, Skepta is more explicit with his attacks, going in on the grime originator by splicing a couple of Dizzee\u2019s well-known bars into a contemptuous cuss: \u201cTell a pussy\u2019ole, look sharp, fix up, where you from?\u201d            3 It\u2019s time grime got its own category on iTunes Konnichiwa is an album packed with Easter eggs for grime fans. On Lyrics, Skepta opens with a sample from the legendarily bad-tempered clash between Pay As U Go and Heartless crew, then references classic raves such as Sidewinder and the still-running Eskimo. Detox sees Skepta dropping bars about early conversations with Wiley, and Man (Gang) has him praising Meridian, the first crew he was part of. Over the course of 12 tunes, Konnichiwa makes a solid case that grime is a unique culture with slang, stars and fashion all of its own, so it\u2019s pretty weird that it\u2019s sold on iTunes under the \u201cAlternative\u201d genre \u2013 and this, presumably because Skepta didn\u2019t want the album to sit in the hip-hop section where most grime ends up. Maybe it\u2019s time for Apple to acknowledge a genre that\u2019s been around for over a decade? 4 Pharrell Williams is a great grime producer  So much of grime was inspired by the skeletal, robotic production of the Neptunes, with tunes such as Clipse\u2019s Grindin\u2019 regularly blasting out on early-00s pirate radio. It\u2019s fitting then, that Pharell Williams should show up as one of the few guest appearances on Konnichiwa. His production and rapping on the track Numbers are both unmistakably Pharell-ish, and yet still influenced by grime\u2019s roots in Bow, London.. It probably cost Skepta a small fortune to get him on the track, but it\u2019s sounding like money well spent. 5 Guest appearances are overrated  Skepta has turned his back on the US trend for packing an album out with guest writers, rappers and producers. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade album had writing and production credits that ran to over 3,000 words \u2013 in contrast, Skepta wrote and produced the majority of Konnichiwa himself. Guest spots are kept down to occasional verses from carefully selected collaborators, but crucially none of them take the attention away from Skepta. The only person on the record who could be seen as a bigger artist than the British MC is the aforementioned Williams, who, as a relatively weak rapper, is never in danger of competing with Skepta bars. This is a one-man show, and Skepta wants everyone to know it.        6 Mr & Mrs Adenuga may be the proudest parents in London   Skepta shouts out his mum and dad throughout Konnichiwa, from gleefully chanting \u201csee me on the TV, hi mum!\u201d on Lyrics, to pointing out that \u201conly my mum and dad call me Junior\u201d on Corn on the Curb. The Adenuga\u2019s two sons, Skepta and JME, are taking grime into the mainstream in a way not seen since Dizzee won the Mercury, and their daughter Julie has become a presenter on Apple\u2019s flagship radio station Beats. Skepta has previously tweeted how much he misses his mum when he\u2019s out on tour, and recently went to Nigeria to build a playground in his dad\u2019s home village. Who says grime is all about beef and weed? 7 Rock and rap are friends again  Man (Gang) sees Skepta spitting ferocious lyrics over a sample culled from Queens of the Stone Age. It\u2019s perhaps the finest meeting of guitars and bars since Run DMC trampled their Adidas shell-toes all over Aerosmith\u2019s Walk This Way, and proves that grime and rock were made for each other. Skepta has some form on this \u2013 last summer he joined yelping punk two-piece Slaves for a savage guitar-fuelled rendition of Shut Down, causing all hell to break out in the moshpit, and laying to rest any horrible memories of the short lived \u201cGrindie\u201d movement. 8 Grime is the most viable protest music in the UK  Konnichiwa bristles with rage and Skepta\u2019s lyrics detailing life as a working-class black man in Britain resound with brutal honesty. Previous single Shut Down took great delight in sampling complaints made to the Brit awards following Kanye West\u2019s decision to flood the stage with grime stars, while Crime Riddim sees the MC breaking down the realities of living in a stop and search world: \u201cThe feds wanna shift man / wanna put me in a van / wanna strip a man / fuck that I ain\u2019t a Chippendale / wanna strip a male / put me in a prison cell / got me biting on my finger nails.\u201d    Related: The best track of 2015: Shutdown by Skepta    9 Skepta loves English slang  UK rappers have long been prone to latching on to US slang, but Skepta appears to be going hard in the other direction. He peppers Konnichiwa with phrases almost belligerent in their Britishness \u2013 lyrics such as \u201cspending pennies in a pissing well\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve got bars like Camden Town\u201d are likely going to baffle Skepta\u2019s growing US fanbase, but it\u2019s hard not to suspect that this may be the point.  10 A great grime album is possible, it just takes a while  Many thought that Skepta\u2019s 5th album would never see the light of day, with its gestation period of two years \u2013 he\u2019s recently said that announcing an album before it is finished is a mistake he doesn\u2019t want to repeat. Part of his hesitation is probably down to the fact that grime has produced few major albums: despite having been around since the early 00s, great grime albums barely number double figures. While fans may have been hoping for more new material (five of the 12 tracks have been floating around for a while), it\u2019s indisputable that Konnichiwa is a triumph, deserving a place on a list that includes Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Boy in da Corner, Wiley\u2019s Treddin on Thin Ice, Ruff Sqwad\u2019s Guns & Roses, Kano\u2019s Home Sweet Home and Neckle Camp\u2019s Straight Necklin\u2019 \u2013 all acknowledged classics of the genre, and all recorded more than 10 years ago. Skepta has proved the great grime album is possible; forthcoming albums from Stormzy and Novelist will show whether it was a fluke or not.",
