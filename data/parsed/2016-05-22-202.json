  "body": "For the past 20 years I\u2019ve put two ideas about power to the scientific test. The first is Machiavelli\u2019s: \u201cIt is better to be feared than loved.\u201d This thesis has not fared well in studies looking at who rises to power in organisations, schools, communities and military units. It isn\u2019t the coercive, manipulative Machiavellian who rises to power. Instead it is the empathetic, generous person who reaches out to others who gains esteem and rises up the ranks. Lord Acton\u2019s observation that \u201cpower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,\u201d however, is confirmed time and time again. As we enjoy elevated power, we are more likely to eat impulsively, have sexual affairs, violate the rules of the road, lie, cheat, shoplift, take sweets from children and communicate in disrespectful ways. Putting these two literatures together leads us to the power paradox. The socially intelligent practices that enable us to rise to power in the first place \u2013 empathy, sharing, open-mindedness, a focus on others \u2013 vanish when we get power. It isn\u2019t just politicians, kings of high finance or drug-addled rock stars who are vulnerable to falls from power. The power paradox can undermine the social life of any of us.    Romantic partners who express gratitude were more than three times less likely to break up    How can we avoid losing power and enjoy enduring respect, esteem and influence? One clue comes from studies of those in power. When we gain power our attention shifts from a focus on others to what is gratifying for us, leading quickly to the abuse of power. Transcending the power paradox is therefore quite simple: just focus on the interests, humanity and dignity of the people around you. This gives rise to the expression of gratitude, perhaps the most important basis of enduring power. For economist Adam Smith, gratitude \u2013 the feeling of reverence for what others give to us \u2013 is the glue to healthy communities: \u201cThe duties of gratitude are perhaps the most sacred of those which the beneficent virtues prescribe to us.\u201d Empirical science agrees: gratitude, even a simple \u201cthank you\u201d, is a basis of power. We can choose to express gratitude in so many ways \u2013 public recognition, expressing appreciation by email, by knowing eye contact, a deferential bow, and acknowledging what another person believes. My research has shown that even brief touches to a person\u2019s arm can communicate gratitude \u2013 they trigger activation in the reward circuits of the recipient\u2019s brain and soothe stress-related physiology. Expressions of gratitude create strong, collaborative ties and pave the way for greater influence. Studies find that individuals who express gratitude to others as groups are forming have stronger ties within the group months later. Romantic partners who express gratitude to their partners in casual conversations were more than three times less likely to break up six months later. When experimenters touch participants on the arm in a friendly fashion, those individuals are more likely to sign petitions and co-operate with a stranger. When teachers encourage students with a pat on the shoulder, those students are three to five times more likely to try solving hard problems. Simply being thanked for completed work led participants to be twice as likely to volunteer for more. Succumbing to the power paradox is the source of so many ills in our social life: anxiety, unethical behaviour and arrogance. But solutions can be found in quotidian practices focused on others, such as the simple \u201cthank you\u201d that punctuates our daily lives.
