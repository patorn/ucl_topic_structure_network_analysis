  "body": "Sara Netanyahu, the wife of the Israeli prime minister, could reportedly face fraud charges relating to a long-running controversy over the management of her husband Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem, following the conclusion of a police investigation. The recommendations of the investigation \u2013 which concluded on Sunday and details of which have been widely reported in the Israeli media, although not officially announced \u2013 are the latest chapter in the long-running saga over the Netanyahu\u2019s household expenses. Sara Netanyahu and her husband\u2019s office strenuously deny any suggestion of wrongdoing.  The prime minister also denies reports that the police investigation had recommended his wife\u2019s indictmentOn his Facebook page, he insisted: \u201cThere was no recommendation in the police\u2019s statement to indict Sara Netanyahu. Contrary to the report, Mrs Netanyahu committed no crime. The various allegations that have been aired by the media outlets will prove to be untrue, just as has happened with all the allegations that have been directed against the Netanyahu family for years.\u201d The couple have faced a litany of criticism over the years. Sara Netanyahu was questioned by the police financial fraud unit \u2013 Lahav 433 \u2013 in December last year, which reportedly concluded there were three cases in which there was sufficient suspicion of wrongdoing to warrant possible prosecution. The investigation reportedly focused on whether the state was defrauded into paying for private expenses at the Netanyahus\u2019 family home in Caesarea, including billing for food and private chefs. Among other issues Sara Netanyahu was questioned about then were claims of unusual work at her private Caesarea home carried out at weekends and on holidays by a political associate of her husband who had been barred from working for the family on official business. In another case \u2013 according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz \u2013 Sara Netanyahu employed a caregiver for her father out of the budget of the prime minister\u2019s residence. The police announcement of the conclusion of the case was unusual in that it did not name any of the individuals involved, although details were quickly leaked and reported across the Israeli media. Police said: \u201cThe national unit of the Israel police has concluded its investigation of the prime minister\u2019s residences. The case began in February 2015 with the approval of the attorney general and the state prosecutor and focused on a number of issues in connection to which suspicion of the commission of criminal offences arose, including fraudulent receipt, fraud and breach of trust, including addressing mutual accusations.  \u201cAt the conclusion all of the purported evidence, findings and insights gathered in the police investigation were provided to the Jerusalem district prosecutor \u2013 which was involved in the investigation \u2013 for its review and decision.\u201d The police investigation was launched after a report by the state comptroller in February last year and in the midst of a long-running court case involving former members of the staff at the prime minister\u2019s official home, which accused Sara Netanyahu of abusive behaviour. In February, a former staff member won a court case against her over the claims. The reported recommendation that criminal charges should be pursued follows hard on the heels of another scandal, detailed in this year\u2019s state comptroller\u2019s report, known as the Bibi Tours affair, a reference to the Israeli prime minister\u2019s nickname. Covering a period when Netanyahu was finance minister in Ariel Sharon\u2019s government, it disclosed how Netanyahu and his family were beneficiaries of state funds and foreign donations \u2013 including from a well-known British businessman \u2013 who paid for trips and stays at hotels.",
