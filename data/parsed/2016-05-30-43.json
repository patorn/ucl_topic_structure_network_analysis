  "body": "Comparisons between Chris Evans\u2019s and Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s Top Gear are not appropriate, programme insiders said in the aftermath of disappointing viewing figures and tepid reviews for Sunday night\u2019s debut of the relaunched show. The BBC2 programme attracted 4.4 million viewers \u2013 below the 5 million Evans had hoped for \u2013 but sources said that it was unfair to make judgements based on the first episode\u2019s ratings because that did not take into account the impact of the bank holiday and the numbers catching up online.  Evans himself insisted the programme was a \u201chit.\u201d The presenter tweeted: \u201cTop Gear audience grew throughout the hour. FACT. Won its slot. FACT. Still number one on i Player. FACT. These are THE FACTS folks\u201d.    Top Gear audience grew throughout the hour. FACT. Won its slot. FACT. Still number one on i Player. FACT. These are THE FACTS folks.\u2014 Chris Evans (@achrisevans) May 30, 2016    The BBC released a supportive statement. Alan Tyler, its acting controller for entertainment commissioning, said that Evans and co-host Matt LeBlanc had \u201csuccessfully kicked off a whole new era in style\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are really looking forward to bringing our audiences even more thrills as the series continues.\u201d   Related: 'So boring it barely exists': readers review the new Top Gear    Evans told the Guardian last week that he would be disappointed if the programme rated below 5 million, although that would be well below Top Gear\u2019s historic viewer numbers.  The last series, featuring Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, averaged 6.4 million viewers. The BBC highlighted the fact that it gained viewers during the hour-long broadcast. A spokesperson added that, by Monday afternoon, Top Gear was the most popular show on iPlayer, with about half a million online views after the BBC2 broadcast, while spin-off show Extra Gear, fronted by motoring journalists Rory Reid and Chris Harris, was the second most watched. Reviews for the first episode were mixed, with some praise for its attempt to stick to the previous incarnation\u2019s format but others lambasting it as a poor attempt to imitate Clarkson and co, who are making their own motoring programme with Amazon. There was criticism of the lack of chemistry between Evans and LeBlanc, though the response to racing driver Sabine Schmitz was broadly positive. The Mail was scathing, describing the revamp as \u201cat best like watching a Top Gear tribute band performing one of those unfunny celebrity sketches on Comic Relief ... It was so bad you could practically hear the champagne corks popping at Amazon HQ\u201d. Andrew Billen in the Times was not convinced by the rapport between Evans and LeBlanc: \u201cChemistry was what we were looking for here, but their badinage was no more than passable offcuts from an unmade transatlantic buddy movie.\u201d His two-star review concluded: \u201cWould we buy a used car show from this man? On this debut, only after some serious tweaking.\u201d One person close to the production said that comparing Evans\u2019 debut on a warm bank holiday to previous series of Top Gear, which normally aired in winter, early spring or autumn, was \u201ccomparing oranges and spanners\u201d. The most recent series shown during the summer launched in June 2013, and attracted 5 million viewers for the opening episode. \u201cIt will take time as we know, but comparing volume figures for last night is a little bit unfair,\u201d said the person, who asked not to be named. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty for Chris and the chaps to build on. It was after all the very first show. It has plenty of room and time to \u200e breathe and develop.\u201d   Related: New Top Gear review: lots of polish but it's still a secondhand car show    A bright spot for most was the performance of racing driver Sabine Schmitz and Evans\u2019 decision to drop some of Clarkson\u2019s blokeish demeanour.  The Mirror said that even Clarkson\u2019s \u201cmost sulky fans\u201d should find a lot to like about the show after his departure and the Telegraph welcomed the new team\u2019s conservative approach. Its four-star review said: \u201cGiven time to bed in, there\u2019s little doubt that we will warm to the new regime. This time next year, most people \u2013 especially those who don\u2019t subscribe to Amazon \u2013 will probably have forgotten what all the fuss was about.\u201d There have been numerous reports that Evans and LeBlanc do not get on, but the former Friends star has dismissed the claims as a \u201cbig load of bullshit\u201d, adding that he \u201cdidn\u2019t anticipate the ruthlessness of the British press\u201d.",
