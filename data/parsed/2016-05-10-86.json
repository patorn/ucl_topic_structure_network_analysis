  "body": "What a thought-provoking article by Tim Lott (Power has shifted from men to\u00a0women \u2013 and now to children, Family, 7 May). And how I felt for him when he was taken aback at being expected to give up his seat for his daughter. I\u00a0love children. I am a mother, and for 30 years I also taught young children. Their needs were put before mine every day, so I am not anti-children. But I used the word \u201cneeds\u201d deliberately because I would draw the line at the expectation of Tim Lott\u2019s daughter that her 60-year-old father should give up his seat for her. And at the two seven-year-olds who were given seats on the tube by a couple. Doesn\u2019t this expectation lead to children developing an attitude of \u201cnobody matters but me\u201d? If this is the new religion and therefore acceptable, would\u00a0somebody please tell me.Christine HoodMiddleton Tyas, North Yorkshire \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
