Channel 4 confirmed that the comical current affairs show, hosted by Antoine de Caunes and French fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier, will be back on the airwaves for one night only, to remind their \u201cstraight-laced British chums\u201d of the \u201cmany, varied and occasionally alarming cultural delights enjoyed by our European cousins\u201d. Eurotrash, which ran on Channel 4 from 1993 to 2007, was one of the UK\u2019s most popular and long-running entertainment shows, gaining cult status for its low-budget feel, weekly parade of bizarre guests and its kitsch take on politics, fashion, sex and fame.  Now notorious features on the show included going underwear shopping with Kylie Minogue, frankly discussing sex with Carla Bruni and artists who painted with their own semen.  In a statement, Channel 4 said the Brexit Eurotrash show would bring together an assortment of \u201ccrazy continentals\u201d from across Europe to remind the people of Britain that \u201cwithout them, we really are just a very sad and insignificant little island with bad food and terrible teeth.\u201d Tim Carter, CEO Twenty Twenty Productions, who is producing the show in association with Rapido Television, said \u201cEurotrash is the reason most of us work in telly! I\u2019m sure when it comes to the referendum, it will be Eurotrash wot wins it ... for which side is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d",
