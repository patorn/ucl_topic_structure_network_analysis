  "body": "Siddhartha Mukherjee calls his history of genetics \u201cintimate\u201d for two reasons. First, he repeats the cinematic cross-cutting of the personal and the scientific that structured his magnificent history of cancer, The Emperor of All Maladies (2011). The\u00a0earlier book includes stories about his own patients (Mukherjee was then an oncologist at Massachusetts general hospital, now he is a staff physician at Columbia University Medical Center in New York). Modern cancer medicine is\u00a0science, but its therapies are delivered at the bedside to patients, sometimes for many years. Cancer is increasingly a\u00a0modern way of life, not just a way of death, and being a \u201ccancer victim\u201d and a \u201ccancer survivor\u201d both contribute to sufferers\u2019 sense of who they are. But not even cancer defines personal identity as powerfully as your genes are now thought to do. In the new book, some of the cross-cut intimacies emerge from Mukherjee\u2019s own Bengali family \u2013 a father with a genetically based brain pathology; a mother whose\u00a0identical twin displayed both the expected similarities with her sister and some surprising differences; and, especially, the sudden appearance of schizophrenia in apparently healthy cousins and uncles, erupting from genetic legacies lying latent within. Shared genetic inheritances were understood to define the family members\u2019 past, their present and their fears about personal futures. Early on in his\u00a0relationship with his wife-to-be, Mukherjee was compelled to tell her about madness in the family: \u201cIt was only fair to a future partner that I should come with a letter of warning.\u201d The intimacies of genetics reach beyond those of family and bedside scenes. Genetics is a new science \u2013 you can plausibly date it from the rediscovery around 1900 of Gregor Mendel\u2019s then practically unknown 1866 paper on the breeding of peas, and the naming of the \u201cgene\u201d in 1909 as a discrete, stable, heritable unit \u2013 but its infiltrations into modern institutions and senses of the self are pervasive. It was scarcely a moment from the first attempts to characterise heritable traits to the emergence of concerted efforts to put those understandings to work in\u00a0engineering better people. In 1905, the English biologist William Bateson presciently wrote that once \u201cthe facts of heredity\u201d became known, \u201cmankind will begin to interfere \u2026 When power is\u00a0discovered man always turns to it. The science of heredity will soon provide power on a stupendous scale.\u201d Darwin\u2019s cousin, Francis Galton, aggressively advocated \u201ceugenics\u201d \u2013 the improvement of human society through selective breeding. He knew nothing of what a gene might be, but he\u00a0urged that the intelligent, the strong and the beautiful should breed more, and the unfit should breed less. Galton reckoned that a proper appreciation of how racial power depended on heredity would institutionalise eugenics and keep the British from becoming even nastier and shorter. By the 1930s, British and American programmes for the sterilisation of the \u201cgenetically defective\u201d inspired the development of Nazi Rassenhygiene. The almost immediate adoption by Hitler\u2019s new regime of a sterilisation law and the later \u201cresearch\u201d on twins by Auschwitz \u201cdoctor\u201d Josef Mengele momentarily ruined the brand for any\u00a0systematic attempts to account for\u00a0human traits in genetic terms and to use that knowledge to intervene. By\u00a0the mid-20th century, Mukherjee writes, the gene had become \u201cone of the most dangerous ideas in history\u201d. Eugenics is typically represented as\u00a0a passing pathology, but Mukherjee suggests ways in which some of its impulses are endemic to the science of heredity. His sweeping and compellingly told history \u2013 and there is no more accessible and vivid survey available \u2013 is about hubristic ambition as much as stunning achievement. Solid genetic science and its dubious extensions into social policy always marched in lock-step, and sometimes in goose-step. The\u00a0Gene is a frank celebration of progress \u2013 the immense and extraordinarily rapid increase of our knowledge of what genes are and how they work \u2013 but Mukherjee is concerned about what that knowledge is doing and about some unsatisfactory ways in which many of us are now encouraged to think about our genes and ourselves. Genetic knowledge has historically been secured largely through the experimental manipulation of peas, primroses, fruit flies, nematodes and micro-organisms and, while Mukherjee has little to say about the hugely important agricultural technologies resulting from plant and animal genetics, the ultimate prize of genetics has always involved ourselves \u2013 how to understand ourselves and how to make better versions of ourselves. Geneticists, of\u00a0all scientists, have had least need to\u00a0be reminded that \u201cthe proper study of mankind is man\u201d.   Related: Siddhartha Mukherjee: 'A positive attitude does not cure cancer, any more than a negative one causes it'    The \u201cgene\u201d was originally an abstraction, then came knowledge of\u00a0where such things might live in the cell and on chromosomes; then what they were made of; how they carried information about physiological functions; how they controlled those functions and were, in turn, regulated. The stages from Watson and Crick\u2019s 1953 discovery of the structure of DNA, to working out how DNA coded for proteins, to the sequencing of the human genome in 2000, all absorbed enormous quantities of intelligence, labour and instrumental ingenuity. But they did not depend on fundamentally new scientific visions. Once it was understood that genes had a discrete chemical identity, it was envisaged that, someday, with work, luck and the right sorts of instruments, knowing all the rest would be possible. But what geneticists did not then imagine was the rapidity with\u00a0which their instrumental powers would change. Few geneticists in the 1960s foresaw the development of genetic techniques, to make new things at biochemical, cellular and organismic levels. The technologies of recombinant DNA, emerging in the early 1970s, allowed geneticists to take DNA from different species, engineer new genes and produce lots of \u201cclones\u201d of the new entity. What initially appeared as an ethical and political concern \u2013 \u201cplaying God\u201d and taking undue risks with nature \u2013 was soon overwhelmed by the golden prospect of using genetically modified micro-organisms as \u201cfactories\u201d for making drugs and other biologics for which there was a need and a\u00a0market \u2013 insulin, for example. And that idea was\u00a0itself transformed into an institutional reality that few had foreseen: genetically engineered entities, or the methods for making them, might be patented, legally protected, powered up by private equity, and made into the foundation of immensely profitable new companies \u2013 among the first, Genentech in San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area and the\u00a0Harvard-linked Biogen in\u00a0Geneva. Genetics first intruded into the public consciousness as eugenics, then as biotech. So one terminus of the history of genetics is the Nasdaq-listed company, but another is a modern mode of self-understanding. \u201cGenes are us,\u201d we are often told: they make us different from everyone else; they seal our fate. (For about $200, you can send off a swab of\u00a0your saliva to the Google-backed company 23andMe, and get an online report about how your genes make \u201cone unique you\u201d.) Gene function responds to the body\u2019s internal environment: cells tell other cells what to do. Your nerve cells and your liver cells have the same genes, but, as geneticists have understood for a long time, some genes that are turned on in one type of tissue are toggled off in others. Your genome is a palette, not\u00a0a painting. Mukherjee wants us to understand that our genome may also respond to the external environment. Some of\u00a0those environmental influences may affect chemical switches turning genes on and off, acting as an \u201cepigenetic\u201d layer of control sitting above the genome, and, he writes, in certain cases etching themselves as \u201cpermanent, heritable marks\u201d that may be passed on to future generations. Our heredity is our environment at one remove, and the flow of biological information is not a straight line but a circle. Mukherjee is cautious about this claim and its intimations of a return to long-discredited \u201cLamarckian\u201d views of evolution driven by \u201cacquired characteristics\u201d. But probably not cautious enough: pre-publication excerpts of this book in the New Yorker unleashed a torrent of criticism in the genetics blogosphere, showing just how much scientific and ideological passion the old nature-nurture dispute still retains, and how concerned geneticists are that the public are under the impression that the environment is everything. Yet Mukherjee is right to nudge us\u00a0away from any simplistic notion that our genes determine our physical and mental identity. The scientific jury is still out on the various versions of\u00a0epigenesis, but Mukherjee has done\u00a0much good by concluding his history of genetics with provocations to think critically about some ways we\u00a0commonly oppose heredity and the\u00a0environment. Sound bites rarely represent sound science. Genes are not\u00a0us. It would be as foolish to deny what our genes do as it would be to assert the sufficiency of our genes in\u00a0making us who we are. \u2022 To order The Gene for \u00a320 (RRP \u00a325) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
