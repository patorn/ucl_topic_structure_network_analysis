The 71-year-old might have retired had he been able to make ends meets but that is now simply impossible. \u201cAll day I\u2019ve been sitting here doing the maths,\u201d he sighs, surrounded by the undergarments and socks he has sold for the past four decades. \u201cMy income tax has just gone up to 29%, my social security payments have gone up 20%, my pension has been cut by 50 euros; they are taxing coffee, fuel, the internet, tavernas, ferries, everything they can, and then there\u2019s Enfia [the country\u2019s much-loathed property levy]. Now that makes me mad. They said they would take that away!\u201d A mild man in milder times, Nakos finds himself becoming increasingly angry. So, too, do the vast majority of Greeks who walked through his door on Monday. \u201cEveryone\u2019s outraged, they\u2019ve been swearing, insulting the government, calling [prime minister] Alexis Tsipras a liar,\u201d he exclaims after parliament\u2019s decision on Sunday night to pass yet more austerity measures. \u201cAnd they\u2019re right. Everything he said, everything he promised, was a fairy tale.\u201d    Related: Greek MPs approve toughest austerity measures yet amid rioting    Until the debt-stricken country\u2019s financial collapse, shops like this were the lifeblood of Greece. For small-time merchants, the pain has been especially vivid because, like everyone Nakos knows, he voted for Tsipras and his leftist Syriza party. Now the man who was swept to power on a platform to eradicate austerity has passed the toughest reforms to date \u2013 overhauling the pension system, raising taxes and increasing social security fund contributions as the price of emergency bailout aid.  As MPs voted inside the red-carpeted 300-seat chamber on Sunday, police who had blocked off a large part of the city centre deployed teargas and water cannon against the thousands of anti-austerity demonstrators amassed outside. It was a world away from the day the tieless, anti-austerity leftists first assumed office, tearing down the barricades outside the sandstone parliament building.  The latest measures \u2013 worth \u20ac5.4bn (\u00a34.3bn) in budget savings \u2013 mark a new era. After nine months of wrangling with the international creditors keeping the country afloat, Athens must apply policies that until now had been abstract concepts for a populace who have suffered as unemployment and poverty rates have soared.

There was fat in the system but that has now gone,\u201d says Vassilis Korkidis, who heads the National Confederation of Hellenic Commerce.  One by one, Korkidis rattles off the figures: Greece\u2019s internal debt amounts to \u20ac220bn of which \u20ac119bn are non-performing loans; its external debt is close to \u20ac330bn; about 230,000 enterprises have shut since the start of the crisis including 10,000 this year alone. \u201cSoon people will have to deal with tax declarations and Enfia and, by September, everything will have piled up. An explosion is possible. September is going to be a very decisive month.\u201d    Related: What do Greeks think of the latest austerity measures?    In his yellow Toyota, Giorgos Balabanis, a taxi driver for the past 15 years, puts it another way. His car, he insists, is a university of life. \u201cAll sorts\u201d get in and out. \u201cAnd what I am hearing every day is that until we leave the euro, until we return to the drachma, until we have a currency that is not so strong, things will never be right,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember me because it\u2019s going to happen. There will be an explosion and Grexit and the drachma will come back.\u201d  Sunday\u2019s vote follows a period of relative calm. After the drama that underpinned the country\u2019s third bailout last summer \u2013 \u20ac250bn has been given to Greece since the EU and International Monetary Fund first saved it from bankruptcy \u2013 Europe\u2019s most indebted nation had dropped from the headlines. It was thought the crisis had subsided, usurped by the drama of Europe\u2019s refugees. But it had not gone away.  In 2016, just as in 2015 and every year for the previous five years, it had coursed like a cancer through Greek life, corroding families, closing businesses, decimating hospitals and every other form of state care, leaving ever more destitute. Denuded of basic supplies, doctors say it is only a matter of time before the health system implodes.

Increasingly, Greece is a land inhabited by rich and poor. Sights that were once shocking \u2013 middle class men and women rifling through the rubbish cans on streets \u2013 are now mundane. That worries Stergiou. Just as it worries Korkidis who foresees more companies fleeing, massive tax evasion returning and the black market flourishing as people try to survive.  \u201cIt can\u2019t go on for ever,\u201d the student, Stergiou, says. \u201cGreeks are running out of stamina, they are running out of endurance. Who will be able to survive on pensions of \u20ac384 a month? Something will have to give.\u201d",
