  "body": "\u201cI feel kind of wild and free. Blood, hair, teeth. I am all animal.\u201d  Frances Stanton isn\u2019t your average girl. Not that she\u2019s extraordinary; she\u2019s different. If people really looked at her, she could have been extraordinary, but nobody did. She was just written off as different; strange.  But how do we really know what someone is like, and what they\u2019re going through? Her mum is an alcoholic prostitute, her dad ran away before the stick turned blue, her mum\u2019s boyfriend/client is an asshole and the one person she thought she could trust called in social services and got her brother \u2013 who now thinks she\u2019s a monster \u2013 taken away. So she did something terrible, for retaliation, for revenge. To make the world hurt and to make it all burn. And now she\u2019s being shipped off to a remote island to improve her Team Skills and make herself a better person.      Until the plane crashes, and instead of making it to the island she was supposed to, she\u2019s stranded on another with no food, water or shelter. Oh, and no people. The Island is about what you\u2019re willing to do, how far you\u2019re willing to go and how much of yourself you\u2019re willing to sacrifice to survive. It\u2019s strong, raw, harsh and filled with the kind of uncut emotion that will leave you stunned and feeling it all. Extremely well detailed, Olivia Levez\u2019s novel manages to capture the stages of survival; how modesty or proper food becomes a thing of the past when you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be alive to see the sun rise tomorrow. I loved the transition; it scared me, but it was beautifully written.  I suppose the only thing I didn\u2019t really understand was (not that I\u2019ve done any research on it) was why delinquents are getting shipped to a remote island in Indonesia, with instructors only a year or two above eighteen? It didn\u2019t make any sense that a rehabilitation and nurturing method of correction would take place in a harsh, isolated environment.  I give this book 4 stars. If you\u2019re looking for haunting writing, then Olivia Levez\u2019s book is one you should pick up.    Related: How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
