  "body": "In Paris\u2019s Place de la R\u00e9publique, in the shadow of Marianne \u2013 the allegorical symbol of libert\u00e9, egalit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9 \u2013 all the talk is of defiance, despite the many baton-wielding riot police. After an extraordinary week in which France\u2019s Socialist government resorted to emergency constitutional powers to force through deeply divisive reforms to employment law \u2013 avoiding a parliamentary vote it would almost certainly have lost \u2013 the youthful movement whose protests have spread across France is debating its response. \u201cWe had had enough before. Now we\u2019ve had enough of enough,\u201d one participant in the Nuit Debout (Up All Night) movement that has occupied the central Paris square since March said yesterday. The youth-led cause has been taken up across France, but Place de la R\u00e9publique \u2013 still a shrine to those killed in last year\u2019s terrorist attacks \u2013 has become the rallying point for protests against the \u201cEl Khomri law\u201d. (It is named after work and employment minister Myriam El Khomri but happens to sound a bit like connerie \u2013 bullshit.) Scenes of riot police in protective gear clearing the square with teargas were broadcast around the world and made the square look like a war zone, but most evenings the atmosphere is more like a music festival: people sit around smoking, drinking beer, discussing politics and planning a workers\u2019 paradise. There are makeshift tents and stands: Po\u00e8tes Debout, Avocats Debout, Cin\u00e9ma Debout, Ecologie Debout, F\u00e9ministes Debout. There is a medical centre, a canteen, even a welcome stand. By the small hours, most of the older protesters have gone home, leaving the young, determined and hardline still standing (or sitting cross-legged on the grey paving slabs), discussing Trotskyist economic theory, anti-capitalism and exploitation. Most feel \u2013 justifiably \u2013 alienated and ignored by France\u2019s political elite on the right, left and centre. But the greatest disappointment, the most profound despair and anger, is reserved for France\u2019s ruling Socialists. \u201cWho are we going to vote for in next year\u2019s presidential election?\u201d wails one woman in genuine anguish. \u201cWho can we vote for on the left? There is nobody.\u201d Franck, a 23-year-old student, has not read the law that is dividing France. Neither have Emmanuel, 28, nor Martine, 46 \u2013 not surprising, given that the final document ran to 392 pages. It doesn\u2019t matter, they say. They\u2019ve read enough to know it\u2019s an erosion of employment rights and will mean more pain and insecurity for workers. The new law amends France\u2019s complex Code du Travail, most notably making the maximum 35-hour working week more flexible, increasing the maximum working day from 10 hours to 12, subject to union agreement, and introducing a cap on redundancy and tribunal payments. But it\u2019s not just the reforms that are causing anger. \u201cThis is about much more than the employment law; it is against many things,\u201d says Martine, who is dispensing legal advice at the Avocats Debout stand. \u201cIt is to say we won\u2019t vote for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, we won\u2019t vote for the right, and we certainly won\u2019t vote for the Front National. But where is the candidate we can vote for? We feel completely lost.\u201d K\u00e9vin Poperl, 28, who has a master\u2019s degree in economics, is founder of the Nuit Debout economics and politics committee, which has drawn up a written opposition to the El Khomri law. He, too, says the protests are about much more than the latest reforms. \u201cThis law was the last straw, but our goal is to change the capitalist mode of production more generally. It will take time. We will not solve 200 years of economic stalemate in a few weeks, but people are becoming more politicised, and this has not happened for 30 years. I am a communist, and we want to reappropriate the economy. People feel we can have capitalism with a human face, but I don\u2019t believe that is possible.\u201d Poperl, who describes himself as left of France\u2019s hard-left Front de Gauche, says he will continue the protests until September, when his unemployment benefit will stop and he\u2019ll have to find a job. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be here in the evenings and weekends,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will be possible to have the change we want without violence: it depends on the position of the enemy. Violence is legitimate, but not always necessary. Each time I walk away from here, I am super-optimistic that change will happen.\u201d Drama student Victor Le Normand, 23, disagrees: \u201cWe\u2019re fed up, but violence will get us nothing.\u201d He says all voices are welcome and heard \u2013 even the heckler clutching a beer can who shouts his support for the police for \u201cdefending us all\u201d. University lecturer Emmanuelle, 33, says Nuit Debout is an expression of a desire to reform the system. \u201cWe need to put the people at the heart of decisions. Right now we\u2019re not being heard or listened to. We feel politically impotent. This isn\u2019t just about the work law; it\u2019s a revolution in society.\u201d By morning the protesters have mostly gone and an army of street cleaners has cleared away the detritus, though not the graffiti sprayed on the stone balustrades of the M\u00e9tro entrance. Marianne, the centrepiece of the square\u2019s \u20ac24m facelift two years ago, is looking tagged and jaded. For Pascal Perrineau, director of Cevipof, the research unit of the Paris Institute of Political Studies (known as Sciences Po), there is an element of tired predictability about Nuit Debout. He says it is just a protest against France\u2019s political class in general and the Socialist government in particular. \u201cThey look like angelic idealists, but when you delve into who is behind Nuit Debout, it\u2019s the same old militant hard left: Trotskyites, anarchists, radical anti-capitalists and neo-communists.\u201d Perrineau says the movement has channelled deep disappointment with Hollande and the left. \u201cIt\u2019s a negative movement. People are rejecting something, but today there is no person from the left they can vote for. What the Nuit Debout people are expressing is the malaise felt in France, nothing more.\u201d Philosopher Yves Michaud told news website Causeur: \u201cNuit Debout is a hardline leftie populist movement, like we\u2019ve seen elsewhere in Europe: Spain has Podemos, Greece has Syriza \u2026 It\u2019s basically the internet meets the soviets.\u201d",
