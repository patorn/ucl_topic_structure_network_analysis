  "body": "This month, it is 25 years since I last saw my dad. With cold shock, I realise that means he\u2019s been gone for five times longer than I knew him. I was five years old when he took his own life. For many people, the passage of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. For me, in many ways it\u2019s got worse. Losing a parent at five meant I didn\u2019t really understand death, or why my dad wouldn\u2019t come home from work any more. I didn\u2019t even know it was suicide until I was 10. My dad\u2019s death has left me with decades of unresolved questions, new realisations and fresh situations to face without a father. Even this far removed from the day he died, I\u2019m still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny trove of memories I jealously hoard, not sure if I really remember them or fabricated them from what I was told.

I wish I could take those days \u2013 when I was too young to notice the arguments between him and my mum, the increasing work stress, him snapping at us when we were just being kids \u2013 and spread them throughout the rest of my life. Couldn\u2019t I swap the day he held me as a baby for my graduation, so he could watch me complete the education he worked so hard to pay for? Couldn\u2019t I trade the time we played with prisms for my wedding day, so I\u2019d have him beside me when I walk down the aisle? I wonder if he really knew what he was doing that day. Did he realise then just how much his death would haunt me? How I\u2019d carry the weight of him with me every day, wondering why he did it, trying to decipher the few tear-stained words in the inadequate note he left, wondering if there\u2019s any reason in the world good enough to leave your two young daughters without a dad? Did he realise I\u2019d spend my life listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Father\u2019s Day or his birthday or any random day, because it suddenly hit me all over again that he was never coming back? Would it stop him? It\u2019s been a quarter of a century and I still can\u2019t let my dad go. Three years ago, I furiously campaigned against an advert that made light of the way he died, and got it withdrawn. I spent that weekend sobbing over a loss that felt fresh again, reading the horrendous comments on the news articles and emails people sent me. He never loved you. He was selfish. He killed himself because he was ashamed of you. Almost worse are the people who say he\u2019d be so proud of me. How could they possibly know? None of us know. I\u2019ll never know what he\u2019d think of me, and it kills me. Every day, the world changes a little more from the one he knew, and he moves further away from me. Everyone expects me to have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago \u2013 before my partner was even born. But they don\u2019t know how it feels to look at the same few photographs knowing there will never be any more. They don\u2019t know how strange it feels to think I once had two parents. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to apologise to your therapist because you made her cry. If I let him go, he\u2019s gone forever, and I can\u2019t take that.   Related: \u2018Let\u2019s reach out to men to halt shocking suicide rate\u2019    The effect of suicide isn\u2019t just the loss of the person who left you behind. It\u2019s the shadow always at your heel. The way every time something bad happens or you feel hopeless, you automatically think of suicide \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s a close call. A few months ago an anonymous account tweeted me, \u201cHere\u2019s hoping 2016 is the year Holly follows in her dad\u2019s footsteps\u201d and I thought \u201cYou don\u2019t know how close I\u2019ve come.\u201d But while I might not know much about my dad, I know that\u2019s not what he\u2019d want for me. It\u2019s not what I want for the people I\u2019d leave behind, either \u2013 he might not have known what it\u2019s like, but I do. I couldn\u2019t put anyone through this. Twenty-five years on, suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under 45 in the UK. Every day, men who feel like my dad did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into despair. Every day, 13 of them take their lives, leaving people like me lost and longing for their sons, husbands, brothers, fathers. And every day I wish I could change what happened. For my dad, the sun will never come out again. But the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more men will live to see another day \u2013 and the more the shadows will fade. \u2022 In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here",
