  "body": "When Pete Sampras was quietly accumulating seven Wimbledon titles in eight years there were those who yearned for more variety. It is an occupational hazard when champions settle into an extended trophy-winning groove but the smooth operators of English rugby are not bothered by such irrelevancies. Having become the first club to complete a Premiership and European double since 2004, Saracens have no intention of easing off now. To listen to Owen Farrell, in particular, was to suspect that Saracens\u2019 hunger for silverware is far from sated and that the roster of all-time dominant sides is on the way to being extended. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll never hit the crest,\u201d said Farrell, who already boasts three Premiership winners\u2019 medals at the age of 24. \u201cHopefully this is just the start and we carry on like this for a long time.\u201d As with Bath, Leicester and Wasps in their respective heydays, winning has become a habit no one wants to shake. With Farrell, the remarkable Maro Itoje, the brothers Vunipola, George Kruis, Will Fraser and Jamie George poised to ensure the backbone of the side stays strong for the forseeable future, it is certainly hard to see Sarries failing to challenge strongly for a third straight domestic crown next season. With the Springbok back-rower Schalk Burger and the talented Wasps fly\u2011half Alex Lozowski among those set to arrive this summer, the loss of estimable individuals such as the retiring Jacques Burger and Charlie Hodgson should not be overly disruptive either.

For Barritt to have led his beloved club side to the European Cup and now the Premiership in the space of a fortnight will go a long way towards easing the pain of last autumn while Goode, whose late try sealed this latest triumph, could not have done much more over the past six months to remind Eddie Jones of his abilities. \u201cFor me he\u2019s by a mile the best full-back in England,\u201d said Mark McCall, fully aware that Jones is not going to select his Test side to face Australia in Brisbane on Saturday week based on other people\u2019s recommendations. \u201cIf I say he should play, he probably won\u2019t.\u201d If this season has revealed anything, though, it is that success is easier to sustain when players are desperate to win for each other as much as themselves. Farrell summed it up nicely when he reflected on another demanding year of juggling club and country commitment: \u201cWe don\u2019t care what people think about us because people can think what they want. It\u2019s about us. It\u2019s about what we believe in and what we do together. That\u2019s why we are where we are.\u201d   Related: Saracens make their experience count to expose young Chiefs of Exeter | Michael Aylwin    It did not feel like a coincidence, either, that Exeter suffered a very similar fate to Bath in the Premiership final 12 months ago. This was yet another of Saracens\u2019s vampire weekends, sucking the life out of previously vibrant opponents, although the Chiefs\u2019 questionable strategy of trying to outdo Saracens at their own pin-point kicking game in the first half also played its part. For Exeter, 23-6 down at half-time, it amounted to yet another Twickenham disappointment to be added to four previous second-tier final losses and a Big Game defeat to Harlequins on this same pitch. Had Mitch Lees and Henry Slade not missed key tackles or Farrell\u2019s pass to Chris Wyles for Sarries\u2019 second try been ruled forward it might have helped but they were equally undone by their first-half inaccuracy in all areas. The unfortunate Henry Slade had one of those days when little went right, just when he wanted to show Jones what a midfield talent he is. On the plus side his fellow tourist Jack Nowell had an excellent match and the Chiefs fought back furiously to within three points of the champions with five minutes left, having previously been only a missed conversion away from reaching a European semi-final. They will come back stronger and increasingly have a base of enthusiastic fans far beyond the Exe Valley. When Northampton supporters arrive in head-dresses and kids from Bristol can be seen doing the \u201cTomahawk Chop\u201d, the Chiefs must be doing something right.
