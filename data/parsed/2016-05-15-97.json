  "body": "Building an exoskeleton of a goat and a prosthetic stomach to digest grass before attempting to cross the Alps on all fours must rank as one of the weirder research projects funded by the Wellcome Trust. But London designer Thomas Thwaites has turned his bizarre mission to bridge the boundary between Homo sapiens and other species by becoming \u201cGoatMan\u201d into an enlightening and funny book. Informed by advice from a Danish shaman, neuroscientists, prosthetists, animal behaviourists and Swiss goat herders, it explores what connects and separates us from other animals. Here are 10 things Thwaites learned. 1. The gap between Homo sapiens and other animals is wide \u201cLook at that goat skeleton and that human skeleton \u2013 they are basically the same,\u201d says Thwaites, looking at the magnificent collection of bones housed by the Grant Museum of Zoology in London. \u201cThese skeletons all have a skull and ribs, and almost all mammals have the same number of vertebrae in their necks.\u201d But Thwaites found the physical challenges of becoming a creature that moved on all fours almost insurmountable. Primates are \u201cweird\u201d, Thwaites says, for putting almost all their weight on their back legs; he required prosthetics to put 60% of his weight on his \u201cfront legs\u201d. His pelvis was also 135 degrees out of alignment. \u201cI was sort of shocked at how bad a goat I was,\u201d he says, \u201cand I was really trying.\u201d     One of Thwaites\u2019s many attempts at building a goat suit.

Storytelling makes us human \u201cIf Neanderthals and other types of human were still extant, there would be much less of a jump between orangutans and Homo sapiens,\u201d he says. Many traits once thought to define Homo sapiens, such as complex language and the ability to use tools, have been demonstrated in other animals. Thwaites suggests the defining characteristic of being human is our ability to move backwards and forwards in time and think in stories. \u201cAny way of being where we\u2019re being rational, we\u2019re thinking in stories,\u201d he says. \u201cWe become the stories we tell ourselves.\u201d 3. We have always wanted to be animals \u201cThis dream of becoming an animal is as old as humanity itself,\u201d says Thwaites. Some paintings of bison- and bird-headed men found in European caves are more than 30,000 years old; similarly ancient cave paintings have been identified in Indonesia. The Danish shaman that Thwaites visited as part of his research demonstrated how, through dance and imitation, it is possible to enter a \u201cbetween-the-worlds state\u201d and begin to see the world through the eyes of an animal. \u201cIt\u2019s not a physical transformation, it\u2019s not like a flash of lightning and then you\u2019re a wolf, it\u2019s having different ideas about where the boundaries are,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cI was surprised by how matter-of-fact she was about stuff I considered mystical \u2013 it was just her view that we could become another animal.\u201d Perhaps this is the biggest irony of all: wanting to be an animal is part of what makes us human. 4. Obscure science is inspiring \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more interesting trying to become a goat when there are people with arcane knowledge,\u201d says Thwaites. His project offers a window into neuroscience, animal behaviourism, biomechanics and some of the less feted scientific endeavours undertaken in labs across the country. He was most inspired by a visit to a microbiologist who was researching the goat rumen, the largest of its four stomachs. \u201cThere are tens of thousands of different organisms in the rumen. It\u2019s inspiring that a poo-ey mixture that is still not understood allows a goat to live on grass. Maybe I liked the grossness of it, that mixture of chemistry and microbiology and guts.\u201d     \u2018I liked the grossness of it, that mixture of chemistry and microbiology and guts.\u2019 Photograph: Tim Bowditch    5. Technology could help us connect with animals Although Thwaites was warned off using technology to get closer to being a goat by the shaman, he deployed a basic shamanistic principle \u2013 that physical imitation helps change consciousness \u2013 alongside the latest scientific work in prosthetics to build himself forelegs and trot like a goat. \u201cJust being in that physical position probably helped,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of a sudden, you are face and mouth first.\u201d The goat\u2019s reputation for eating everything is widely misunderstood \u2013 goats are curious, and touch and check things with their mouth, as we do with our hands. 6. Being a goat is exhausting Thwaites spent three days in Alpine meadows, doing his best to mix with a herd of goats. \u201cNo one was using that much energy, there weren\u2019t wolves around, we weren\u2019t being driven along a mountain path, but it was still difficult, especially going downhill,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cAfter a while, the prosthetics started rubbing, and I got sweaty and cold.\u201d This physical discomfort \u201cencroached\u201d on his attempts to think like a goat. 7. Acceptance is bliss Thwaites blundered when he briefly took up the \u201cdominant\u201d position in the herd at the highest point in the meadow. After some initial wariness, however, his fellow goats came to tolerate the strange GoatMan among them. Thwaites was also delighted when the Swiss goat herder remarked to the local farmer that he had been accepted. \u201cI genuinely think I made a kind of goat friend, a bit of a pal, and hung out with Goat No 18,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cNot being able to read that number on his tag was the goal, not being able to see that goat as a goat but as another person was the goal. I tried, but you can\u2019t stop your brain from being itself.\u201d     \u2018I was sort of shocked at how bad a goat I was \u2013 and I was really trying.\u2019 Photograph: Tim Bowditch    8. Becoming another animal can make us more humble \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember every now and again that we are animals,\u201d says Thwaites, \u201cbecause it helps us to think ourselves away from some of the more crazy aspects of our society and humanity. Being an animal would help us remember that there is no manifest destiny to the human species \u2013 we are just among all these other creatures. The innate certainty that everything will be OK in the end and we\u2019ll get to that Star Trek utopia \u2013 that is definitely not certain. That is just a story.\u201d 9. Being a goat could be the new mindfulness \u201cAnimals are very in the moment. They don\u2019t have an idea of the future or the past as a narrative that they tell themselves,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cThe mindfulness-wellness sphere is all about being present in the now \u2013 it\u2019s remembering that you\u2019re an animal, being present in your physical body, being in nature; it\u2019s a way to engage with your less self-conscious side.\u201d Perhaps Thwaites could become a wellness guru? \u201cI\u2019d need an investor to help make the goat-suit a little more comfortable. Perhaps I could go on Dragon\u2019s Den and say: \u2018I want to start a new wellness movement.\u2019\u201d 10. GoatMan will stalk the fields again If that doesn\u2019t quite take off, Thwaites has at least received messages from goat herders across Europe inviting him to become a temporary member of their herds. He\u2019d like to try again, because he felt that his obligation to document the project through cameras inhibited a more meditative attempt to become a goat. \u201cThere\u2019s a goat herd in the Czech Republic to which I\u2019ve been invited, and I\u2019ve always wanted to go to the Czech Republic,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cI\u2019d also love to keep some goats. It\u2019s a bit difficult in Peckham, but that\u2019s definitely the long-term plan.\u201d GoatMan: How I Took a Holiday from Being Human by Thomas Thwaites is published on 17 May",
