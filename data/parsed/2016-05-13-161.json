  "body": "The suspension of Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, and the new, all-male, conspicuously white cabinet that will run one of the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse nations under interim president, Michel Temer, is an unwelcome reminder of the fact that getting more diversity into government continues to be an uphill struggle.  It\u2019s why we still need organisations such as Women in Parliaments, the Brussels-based network that campaigns for more women in politics around the world. In contrast to the look of the new Brazilian cabinet, there was a great moment last week when 260 female MPs took their seats under the dome of Jordan\u2019s parliament building for the WIP global summit \u2013 a conference for female and some male parliamentarians to get together and discuss how to increase the number and the influence of women in parliaments all around the world.   Related: Women in Parliaments: 'If we want to change society we need power'    These are the women, from New Zealand, Mexico, Jordan, the UK, Germany, Romania, Rwanda and more than 50 other countries, who make a difference in politics in their own countries, despite the fact that 80% of public policy-makers and 90% of world political leaders are men. And they know it: this is the 5th WIP summit since the organisation was set up in 2013 and there is always an astonishing moment when the women take their seats and everyone looks round and realises, yes, this parliament is now full of women. It\u2019s almost an audible intake of breath \u2013 and a rush to take photos. Women are still woefully under-represented in parliamentary seats, holding only 22% of seats in the world\u2019s governments. Meetings like the one in Jordan serve a pragmatic purpose, identifying practical measures to dismantle barriers holding up further progress and gathering evidence on the influence of women in powerful positions. It was also a significant move to hold the meeting in a Middle-Eastern country, not without controversy: a vote by the Jordan parliament to deny Israeli female parliamentarians access to the chamber, while in no way a decision by WIP itself, highlighted the problems of holding a non-political meeting for politicians in a region riven by dispute. Nonetheless, holding the meeting in Jordan sent a powerful message about the progress of female parliamentarians and about women\u2019s rights more widely in the Middle East and North Africa. A keynote speech came from the speaker of the UAE parliament, Amal Al Qubaisi, who was elected as the first female speaker of the Federal National Council in November 2015.   Related: Why aren\u2019t there more women standing for election?    WIP chair Hanna Birna Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir, an Icelandic MP and former mayor of Reykjavik, told the UK\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour on 9 May that although Arab women have one of the lowest representations in parliaments worldwide, there has been a steady increase in women\u2019s participation to 18% of seats. \u201cIt is not enough, not fast enough, but there are positive trends out there,\u201d she said. Organisation such as WIP, said Birna Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir, work not only getting more women into power, but also work to increase their influence on legislation. \u201cThere is a critical mass for women\u2019s voices to be heard and get the issues women care about onto the table,\u201d she said. Birna Kristj\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir also noted that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to get the Democrat nomination and her bid to become the first female US president is based on policies, both worldwide and domestically, aligned with women in power and women\u2019s wellbeing. Pauline Latham, a British MP attending a WIP summit for the first time, summed up her feelings, when she said, at the closing session of the conference, how impressed she had been by the speakers and participants. \u201cIf only there were more parliamentarians like the ones in this room we really could rule the world,\u201d she said.
