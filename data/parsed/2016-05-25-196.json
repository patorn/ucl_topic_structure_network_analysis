  "body": "1. Your Song  Sir Elton Hercules John might be considered a balladeer, but in 1970 there was surprise at his label, DJM, that his breakthrough song was a slow, whimsical serenade. Those who\u2019d followed his fledgling career perceived the Elton John Band to be a rocking affair, incorporating gospel, honky-tonk and elements of psychedelic folk. In the US, the pretty Your Song, with a naively romantic lyric by Bernie Taupin, was the B-side to the more uptempo Take Me to the Pilot, but it was promoted to the lead track after radio stations persisted in plugging it. It made the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic, and was the beginning of a run of bestselling singles and superstardom (especially Stateside) that would make John the biggest pop star on the planet for five years. He went on to sell more than 100m singles, but his first hit is still one of his defining moments, and its opening line \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit funny / This feeling inside\u201d \u2013 remains instantly recognisable. 2. Rocket Man John\u2019s 11th single, taken from the album Honky Ch\u00e2teau, is arguably his best-loved. The 1972 track didn\u2019t quite make it to No 1 in the US \u2013 he\u2019d have to wait until Crocodile Rock later that year for that \u2013 but it has endured as one of the key songs of the early 70s, thanks in part to its wonderful production. With Gus Dudgeon on board, it\u2019s not hard to see where inspiration for the space epic might have come from. Dudgeon had produced Space Oddity by David Bowie in 1969. (Bowie\u2019s regular producer Tony Visconti had refused to work on the track, calling it a \u201ccheap shot\u201d.) Dudgeon repeated the trick with John, imbuing a song about space travel with an otherworldly ambience. (There\u2019s also a druggy subtext: lines include \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna be high as a kite by then.\u201d) Bowie and John might have seemed destined to become kindred spirits, but the former said they had little in common. In a Playboy interview, Bowie made some catty comments, referring to John as \u201cthe Liberace \u2026 the token queen of rock\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019m responsible for a whole new school of pretension. They know who they are, don\u2019t you, Elton?\u201d John would bide his time before hitting back. 3. Bennie and the Jets As with Your Song, it was radio play that turned Bennie and the Jets into a smash hit \u2013 against John\u2019s will (he thought the song was too strange to succeed). CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, aired it first, then Detroit radio stations and Top 40 stations across the US followed suit. Bennie (Benny on the single sleeve, Bennie on the album) was not only a No 1 in America, but it also became John\u2019s first crossover hit, landing him on the R&B chart for the first time. An invitation to appear on Soul Train followed, and John became the first white British artist to be accepted on black radio a good year before Bowie and the Bee Gees. At this point in his career \u2013 the song came from the double album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road \u2013 John could do no wrong. Nor could his producer: Dudgeon bookended the track with whistles from a live concert and vocal loops to give it a vitality that still stands up. The slow staccato tension of the grand piano and Taupin\u2019s bombastic lyric about a fictional glam-rock band combine to stunning effect on one of their most inspired collaborations.            4. Philadelphia Freedom John needed a suitable number to back his performance of Bennie and the Jets on Soul Train in 1975. He opted to perform a song he hadn\u2019t yet released. Philadelphia Freedom was inspired \u2013 in name at least \u2013 by Billie Jean King\u2019s Philadelphia Freedoms tennis team, even if the Bernie Taupin lyric had little to do with tennis and everything to do with emancipation; there\u2019s also a line about flag waving, which tapped into the US bicentennial celebrations. John \u2013 an avid record collector with a staggering library that he still maintains, apparently \u2013 has never been afraid to use contemporary musical trends in his music, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that he set about re-creating the Philly soul sound. The song failed to reach the Top 10 in the UK, but it landed John his fourth No 1 in three years in the US.  5. Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future) In 1975, John was sitting on top of the world, becoming the first artist to have an album debut at No 1 on the Billboard 200 with Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy. Its follow-up, Rock of the Westies, was subpar, however, and John\u2019s hot streak began to cool. But there was still room for another US No 1 single: the nauseatingly upbeat Island Girl, which reached only No 14 in the UK (a placing too generous by half). John had wanted to lead with the fabulously funky Elton John single-that-never-was, Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future), and in retrospect his instincts seem correct. Dan Dare is a cornucopia of vocoder, funky bass, honky tonk piano and irresistible slabs of Clavinova. John is at his best when he is consumed by a groove, and few tracks have more groove than Dan Dare. It may not be his best-known song, but it was used as the soundtrack for an animated film of the same name in 2001.        6. Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word Relentless touring, substance abuse and the production of two albums a year were beginning to take their toll in the mid 1970s. Despite all of his success, John\u2019s lifestyle was making him unhappy \u2013 a feeling manifested in the mood of his 1976 album Blue Moves, a funereal double record. After it was completed, he parted with Gus Dudgeon. (They would resume their working relationship a decade later.) The mood on Blue Moves might have been macabre, but the lead single Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word is a tour de force of raw, plaintive emotion and tender, deceptively clever keystrokes. In the video promo, a tearful-looking Elton sits at a giant white grand piano on an uncharacteristically nondescript set; gone are the wacky glasses and the hairpiece, the giant shoes and the Donald Duck costumes.  7. Ego By 1978, sales in the US had, relatively speaking, dropped off a cliff. Whether that was to do with an artistic slump or John\u2019s admission to Playboy magazine that he was bisexual, or both, isn\u2019t clear. Ego was infused with camp and a high-octane nervous energy, but it struggled to No 34 in the US and the UK. The disappointment for Elton was palpable, and the strain showed. He decided to retire from playing live \u2013 not for the last time \u2013 and his working relationship with best pal and lyricist Bernie Taupin was paused \u2013 at least until John signed a new deal with Geffen Records in the 80s and the label put the dream team back together. Ego was the last song the pair worked on before parting, and it\u2019s a fitting conclusion to the first phase of John\u2019s career, even if the public didn\u2019t wholly agree. While Ego could easily be about Elton\u2019s own megalomania, some listeners believed the track was aimed at David Bowie. According to biographer David Buckley, it apparently stuck in John\u2019s craw that Bowie had come out as bisexual while in a heterosexual marriage, while he felt he\u2019d had to conceal his sexuality. It also didn\u2019t help that the critics fawned over Bowie\u2019s art-school pretensions while John \u2013 the entertainer \u2013 was disparaged by many of the same tastemakers. 8. Are You Ready for Love? The late 70s were difficult; John wasn\u2019t accepted by the punks, and his half-hearted bandwagon-jumping disco album Victim of Love was rightly panned by critics, disappearing without a trace. Intriguingly, he had recorded some more Philly soul-inspired numbers in 1977 with lyricist Gary Osborne and producer Thom Bell. (For some reason, MCA didn\u2019t release the Thom Bell Sessions EP until 1979.) The public clearly weren\u2019t ready for Are You Ready for Love? It was pushed on a B-side and largely forgotten until 2003, when an Ashley Beedle remix was used in an advert for the Premier League. Suddenly, a lost classic got its moment in the sun, and Are You Ready for Love? catapulted to No 1 in the UK. It would become Elton\u2019s biggest hit since the revival of Candle in the Wind in 1997. Are You Ready was such an ebullient song that it\u2019s hard to understand how it could have been so neglected in the first place.            9. Nobody Wins Lyricist Gary Osborne may not have written as many words that passed into pop\u2019s vernacular as Bernie Taupin, but he had a special skill that came in very handy for 1981\u2019s Nobody Wins. John heard Janic Pr\u00e9vost\u2019s J\u2019Veux d\u2019la Tendresse in 1980, when he was living in France; falling in love with the track, he decided to record it himself. Osborne, it transpired, not only wrote his own words, but also translated songs from foreign languages, a talent that had kept him remunerated during his late teens. Jean-Paul Dr\u00e9au\u2019s original French lyric, about a once passionate but now loveless marriage, must have resonated with Elton. It epitomised his feelings about his own parents\u2019 frosty relationship, something he wasn\u2019t afraid to talk about in numerous interviews. Alas, it was perhaps too \u201cEuropean\u201d for the UK market, charting outside the Top 40, which seems criminal in hindsight. 10. I\u2019m Still Standing            John rediscovered commercial success in 1983, with tracks including I Guess That\u2019s Why They Call It the Blues and I\u2019m Still Standing reaching the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic. Where so many of his albums had begun to feature a few good singles and an awful lot of filler, his 17th LP, Too Low for Zero, became his most consistent offering since his 70s heyday. I\u2019m Still Standing, in particular, was a bullish testament to survival, and one in the eye for those detractors who\u2019d assumed Reg Dwight was finished. The song is an invigorating slab of high camp, and it was the one time John made an effort for the video, even pulling off a few choreographed moves. He would had further success in the 90s (including the bestselling single of all time), but the schmaltzy ballads he peddled then are more shadows compared with his greatest material. Nothing can touch the explosion of creativity that made him such a massive star in the early 70s.",
