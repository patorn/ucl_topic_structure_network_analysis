  "body": "You\u2019re playing music-hall performer Archie Rice in a revival of John Osborne\u2019s The Entertainer. Can you talk through the look for your character (seen, below, for the first time)? The play is being directed by Rob Ashford, with whom I\u2019ve now collaborated three times, and he comes from a choreographic background. He wanted me to very much concentrate on Archie as a hoofer, not to feel that he was someone who regarded himself as being on the skids. The problem for Archie is not, in Rob\u2019s view, so much that he is troubled about the possibility that his career and talent are second-rate, but he is terrified that his soul might be. What Rob wanted to see was a sort of theatrical grafter, a hoofer, so we maybe see more of the sacrifices Archie has to go through in order just to get on \u2013 or even be as good as he hopes will keep an audience\u2019s attention. I think there may be just a little more dancing, more of that backstage graft and a sense of the sweat on the guy than people may be expecting.     On the hoof \u2026 Kenneth Branagh as Archie Rice in The Entertainer. Photograph: Johan Persson    The role was first played by Laurence Olivier, who famously sported a bowler hat and a bow tie and so on \u2026 We\u2019re trying to get away from very strong images like that. What goes with that image is this sense of the play as a certain kind of classic with maybe a few cobwebs around it \u2026 But you could argue that this is perhaps a more revolutionary play than, say, Look Back in Anger. And I think it gives voice to what you might call the angry young woman in [Archie\u2019s daughter] Jean Rice. I\u2019m trying to come at it from a different kind of place. Despite Archie being at the centre of things, there\u2019s a youthful fire in the play. It gives the greatest kind of pragmatism and idealism and intelligence to the women of the play, not just Jean Rice \u2013 who is in many ways the voice of the call to arms in the play for political engagement. It feels very contemporary. She is someone who is articulating this questioning of the idea that one does follow state and government without question. She encourages participation and demonstration and agitation. \u2026 The play is sometimes thought of as a lament, a minor-key wind-down, end-of empire, with an elegiac quality that is in line with Archie\u2019s decline. But what it feels like to us is much more of the usual and youthful Osborne theatrical grenades going off.  Olivier famously said that his interpretation of a character started from the shoes up. How about you?     The science of comedy \u2026 Branagh and Brydon in The Painkiller. Photograph: Johan Persson    I\u2019ve had the chance to do a tremendous amount of research. I\u2019ve spent the last eight weeks bending Rob Brydon\u2019s ear about everything and anything to do with delivering gags in standup comedy. I\u2019ve always admired standup comics for just that gladiatorial engagement with the audience. I\u2019ve also spent eight weeks immersed in the sort of science of comedy [starring alongside Brydon in The Painkiller at the Garrick theatre] \u2013 why does a laugh happen brilliantly one night, how can you secure it, what are the variables that you can attempt to fix to guarantee that reaction happens for each audience? There are so many variables. There is such a savage black-and-white encounter in comedy. If they laugh it\u2019s good and if they don\u2019t it\u2019s a terrifying tumbleweed silence. That sort of electric, deadly tension is what Osborne writes all the way through with Archie Rice. So standup comic friends have been the subject of intense investigation. Another amazing experience I had recently was watching Ken Dodd live. Ken Dodd is now in his mid-80s. He appeared as Yorick in our film of Hamlet [in 1996]. I\u2019ve always admired and liked him very much. He is incredible in the way he assaults an audience. He has a running gag about the length of time he stays on stage. He started bang on time, when I saw him, at seven o\u2019clock. I came out of that theatre at five past midnight. I swear to God. There were some other acts on but it was mostly him. I\u2019ve got to say, in the last quarter of the show, he was funnier than ever with this front-footed, irresistible, implacable assault on the audience. It was an absolute masterclass. That was a very salient insight into what it can take to hold an audience. When I spoke to him afterwards, he was saying \u2013 as all comics, I\u2019ve found do \u2013 he was trying things out that night. Some of it didn\u2019t work, some of it he stayed with for longer than he should have done. These guys are obviously in the comedy laboratory. That process also keeps the atmosphere in something like The Entertainer alive. Dodd has said that Shakespeare was a sort of standup comic at heart. Well, Shakespeare was certainly unafraid to dance between highbrow and lowbrow. Someone like Ken Dodd, in the space of one five-hour show, goes from entirely daft gags \u2013 \u201cDoctor, doctor\u201d gags and \u201cKnock, knock\u201d gags \u2013 and then on to extended, I would say cerebral, comic diversions and monologues that are full of very esoteric ideas. You can feel he\u2019s playing with expectations, subverting himself to the audience but not being afraid to somehow let some of his soul through, some of his personal preoccupations, even if it\u2019s all at the service of a gag.            Before you start The Entertainer, you\u2019ll be putting on Romeo and Juliet in the Garrick season. It\u2019s 30 years since you directed yourself in the play Yes, 30 years ago Samantha Bond played Juliet and I played Romeo. Today, Paris is played by Tom Hanson, the son of Samantha Bond. So you realise time is moving when that happens. But the play has lost none of its dynamism and volatility. It has a kind of volcanic intensity. Hazlitt referred to it as tragedy in a minor key \u2013 that minor key is driven by a youthfulness and excitement and a pell-mell pace that is exciting to behold. We\u2019ve trimmed the play quite a bit. It mentions in that first speech, the \u201ctwo hours\u2019 traffic of our stage\u201d. I\u2019ve always felt slightly frustrated that productions don\u2019t seem to follow that through. We\u2019ll get as close to that as possible.  The Entertainer is at the Garrick theatre, London, from 20 August to 12 November, with a worldwide cinema broadcast on 27 October. Romeo and Juliet is at the Garrick theatre from 12 May to 13 August, with a cinema broadcast on 7 July",
