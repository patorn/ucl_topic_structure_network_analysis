  "body": "We have written to the Britain Stronger in Europe and Vote Leave campaigns to ask how a leave or remain vote will affect the UK\u2019s treasured natural environment and its remarkable and already threatened species (Could Brexit be the best thing for Europe\u2019s wildlife?, theguardian.com, 9 May). The decision on whether to stay in the EU or to leave will have many far-reaching and long-term effects. While several of the areas where this effect will be felt have been debated in some depth, such as trade, investment, immigration and jobs, there are other important areas that have not been given attention by campaigners, but directly or indirectly affect us all. A\u00a0significant gap is the impact on wildlife. The outcome of June\u2019s referendum has the potential to change the face of the UK\u2019s countryside for generations to come. We strongly believe that whether people are committed to the EU, determined to leave, or still undecided, the effect their vote will have on the natural environment must be known. We have asked both campaigns to make clear what effect their preferred referendum result will have on the UK\u2019s wonderful natural environment that so many of us care about.Chris Packham President, Dr David Gibbons Chair, Julia Hanmer Joint CEO, Kit Stoner Joint CEOBat Conservation Trust \u2022 It is time progressive forces in British politics came together to make the positive case for Europe. With ITV planning a debate between David Cameron and Nigel Farage, we need to energise the 75% of registered voters who didn\u2019t back the Conservatives in last year\u2019s general election. Anyone who professes to be a progressive leader must explain that it is the EU protecting worker rights, setting environmental standards and regulating the banks. So far Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Euro battle bus hasn\u2019t clocked up too many miles. He, and leaders of the other so-called progressive parties, should join me on platforms up and down the country. Progressive leaders must be in the futures business, and it\u00a0is vital for our children\u2019s future that our place in Europe is protected.Tim Farron MPLeader, Liberal Democrats  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
