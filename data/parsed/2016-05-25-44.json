World Trade Organisation boss, Roberto Azevedo, said Britain would be forced to renegotiate trade deals with all 161 WTO members in an unprecedented move that would be akin to joining from scratch. The impact of new tariffs in overseas markets would also be a burden for UK businesses, adding a further \u00a35.5bn to the costs of trade, he said.   Related: Here\u2019s the economic reality of Brexit \u2013 without the unicorn fantasy  | Anton Muscatelli    \u201cThe consumer in the UK will have to pay those duties,\u201d Azevedo said. \u201cThe UK is not in a position to decide \u2018I\u2019m not charging duties here\u2019. That is impossible. That is illegal.\u201d  His comments came as ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s said sterling\u2019s status as a reserve currency would be jeopardised by a decision to quit the EU as central banks around the world would sell their holdings in favour of more secure currencies. S&P said countries with a reserve currency earned considerable income from heavy trading on foreign exchange markets and enjoyed lower interest charges on overseas debt. \u201cA departure from the EU could put sterling\u2019s reserve status at risk by deterring foreign direct investment and other capital inflows into the UK,\u201d it said, adding that because last year\u2019s current account deficit was the world\u2019s second-highest, any decline in capital inflows would weaken the pound and hit GDP growth. The remain camp said the two interventions left the economic argument for leaving the EU \u201cin tatters\u201d. Former business secretary Vince Cable said Brexit campaigners believed British businesses would be no worse off operating under WTO rules compared to exporting from inside the EU. \u201cBut the head of the WTO has warned leaving the EU could cost the UK billions in trade and lead to years of damaging uncertainty. The comments from the WTO are especially important as Boris Johnson has made clear that his vision of a \u2018Brexit future\u2019 lies within a WTO framework. Standard & Poor\u2019s warning over sterling would mean higher prices, higher mortgage rates and more government debt.\u201d Boris Johnson told the BBC in April: \u201cThe WTO has changed the way trade works in the world now. Tariff barriers are much less important and don\u2019t forget 73% of the non-EU trade we do at the moment is done without any kind of trade deal whatsoever.\u201d The WTO and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which came into force in 1948, were created to lower trade barriers and police disputes.  Azevedo told the Financial Times: \u201cPretty much all of the UK\u2019s trade [with the world] would somehow have to be negotiated. It is extremely difficult and complex to negotiate these trade agreements. And slow as well. Even if you are in a position to negotiate quickly with all these other members it doesn\u2019t mean that they will be in a position to negotiate with you because they have their own priorities.\u201d   Related: Trade policy is no longer just for political nerds: it matters in the UK and US    Responding to Azevedo\u2019s comments, the chief executive of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliot, said: \u201cAt the moment our trade relations are dictated by the EU, and this means British businesses are subject to unnecessary constraints. For example, we are forbidden from making free-trade agreements with India and other emerging economies, and we are bound by rules and regulations that we have no say over. Not only that, we currently have no seat at the WTO but are just one of 28 countries represented by the EU. If we vote leave, we can take back control of our our own trade relations, and look forward to a more secure and more prosperous future.\u201d Britain could opt to simply scrap all trade barriers, as some free market economists have advocated, and turn its economy into a duty-free state, but that was unlikely, Azevedo said. He suggested that a burden of great responsibility rested with UK voters regarding Britain\u2019s future trade position and the wider economy. Azevedo said: \u201cIt is a very important decision for the British people. It is a sovereign decision and they will decide what they want to decide. But it is very important, particularly with regard to trade, which is something very important for the British economy, that people have the facts and that they don\u2019t underestimate the challenges.\u201d  S&P analyst Frank Gill said several other countries could soon be in a position to take over from sterling as a reserve currency, which it defines as accounting for at least 3% of global foreign exchange reserves. The Australian and Canadian dollars have increased from close to zero a decade ago to a combined 3.8% at the end of last year.",
