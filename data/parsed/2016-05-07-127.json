  "body": "Thirty hours after raging wildfires forced more than 80,000 residents to flee the northern Alberta city of Fort McMurray, one evacuee, Chris Byrne, decided it was time to head back to his charred city. \u201cI\u2019m not a cop, I\u2019m not a firefighter,\u201d said Byrne, who is, instead, a host at the local radio station Rock 97.9. \u201cI don\u2019t have any special skills, but one thing that I do love is being able to inform people.\u201d Amid warnings from officials that the city was not safe, Byrne and a station engineer made their way from Edmonton \u2013 where they had ended up after Tuesday\u2019s evacuation \u2013 to Fort McMurray to begin broadcasting again.  \u201cWe were passing car after truck after SUV, and campers that had run out of fuel \u2026 that had just been abandoned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of crazy, the amount of them.\u201d  Byrne was one of the tens of thousands of residents who, earlier in the week, had sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic as flames licked the city\u2019s main highway and coated the air in a blanket of smoke.

Photograph: AP    Now, as officials reported the wildfires had cut a path of destruction through several neighbourhoods and destroyed more than 1,600 homes and buildings, he was going home.  Unseasonably hot temperatures, extremely dry conditions and winds of up to 70km/h (44mph) helped fuel the fire\u2019s spectacular growth to 101,000 hectares on Friday \u2013 an area more than 10 times the size of Manhattan \u2013 up from just 10,000ha earlier in the week. With temperatures expected to hit 27C (80F) on Saturday, officials said the fire could double in size by end of the day. On Friday, Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, said Fort McMurray was still trapped in the grip of the inferno. \u201cThe city of Fort McMurray is not safe to return to and this will be true for a significant period of time,\u201d she told the thousands of evacuees scattered across the province.            Alberta driver\u2019s dashcam footage of wildfire    Byrne passed through several police blockades to reach the city, at times waiting patiently after fires jumped the highways. The journey had been approved by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police because it was considered that restarting the station could help restore essential services to the area. The pair were told to bring their own water, food and respirators to help withstand the conditions. As they neared Fort McMurray, the smoke became so thick they could no longer see beyond the reach of their headlights. \u201cYou could barely even see the lines in the road from the wildfire smoke that was coming in.\u201d Then they reached the outskirts. \u201cThe trees are still there, but there\u2019s no greenery on them,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cYou expect to see apartment buildings, townhouses \u2013 you look and there\u2019s nothing. It just looks like charred dark earth. Everything is just gone.\u201d  In contrast, the city\u2019s downtown was fairly intact. Byrne was also delighted to find his home in the northern part of the city still standing. \u201cThe most impactful moment for me was walking through the door,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was immediately followed by a sense of regret that I\u2019m experiencing this and there are thousands of people who won\u2019t be able to.\u201d    Related: There\u2019s more to Fort McMurray than oil sands \u2013 it\u2019s a real community | Aritha van Herk             Blaze rips through Fort McMurray home \u2013 timelapse video    The extent of the destruction wreaked by the fire was evident in a video uploaded to YouTube on Thursday. Apparently shot by a firefighter, the footage shows a devastated landscape dotted with piles of blackened rubble and the burned out frames of pickup trucks. A thick haze of smoke still hangs overhead, while small fires flare among the ruins.  One of the firefighters can be heard saying: \u201cCrazy, a whole neighbourhood just lost last night.\u201d           Eerie footage from inside Fort McMurray following raging wildfires    More than 1,200 firefighters, 100 helicopters, 295 pieces of heavy equipment and two dozen air tankers are fighting the blaze. But officials said this week that a change in the weather was the only way the fire could be halted.  \u201cLet me be clear: air tankers are not going to stop this fire,\u201d said Chad Morrison, Alberta\u2019s manager of wildfire prevention. \u201cThis fire will continue to burn for a very long time until we see some significant rain.\u201d Environment Canada said there was a 40% chance of rain in the area on Sunday. The country\u2019s public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, vowed to send firefighters and water from other provinces. \u201cThey are dealing with a beast of a fire, one of the worst we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. If more resources were required, the government would ask the US for help, he added. On Friday, police and the military oversaw the procession of hundreds of cars heading south, after officials decided to move evacuees to where they could better access support services. Mass airlifts, which began on Thursday, also continued to take thousands of people to Calgary and Edmonton, the province\u2019s two major cities.

About 1,200 vehicles had passed through Fort McMurray by late afternoon on Friday, in a steady exodus that was only once forced to halt due to heavy smoke. By then Byrne had managed to get the transmitter up and running, but the fires had left the station reliant on its backup iPod. \u201cThere\u2019s only about 25 or so songs on a rotation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had people texting me saying if I hear Patience by Guns N\u2019 Roses one more time, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m done.\u201d  On Friday, reports emerged suggesting that Byrne was not the only resident in the evacuated city. The RCMP said officers had come across a family of five \u2013 including three young children \u2013 who had not heeded the evacuation orders. \u201cThey did not believe they were in danger,\u201d the RCMP told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. An elderly man and his dog were also found in the city. All of them were safely evacuated with officials pointing to the wildfires that continue to roar, scattering red-hot embers and painting the skyline a blazing orange. Still, Byrne is hoping to stay. \u201cPeople have been telling me to stay safe, as if I\u2019m just going to run headlong into a forest fire,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not Vice, I\u2019m not a gonzo journalist.\u201d",
