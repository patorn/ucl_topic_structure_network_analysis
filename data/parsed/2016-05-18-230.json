  "body": "For many pop stars, a new haircut is the calling card of individuality. In that highly controlled, infantalising environment, where all your needs are taken care of, it can be a much-needed from of expression.  Think about Taylor Swift\u2019s recent bleached bob (Debbie Harry via Little J in Gossip Girl), a high fashion reinvention with punk aspirations; Justin Bieber\u2019s dreadlocks, a questionable nod to black culture; and, of course, Britney Spears\u2019s shaved head from 2007, which seemed like a desperate bid for independence.      Harry Styles\u2019s grownup hairdo.   Harry Styles\u2019s long locks telegraphed his mental exit from One Direction. Wearing his hair like a member of an altogether different band (the Rolling Stones) suggested a bedroom door-slamming rebellion from the star-making machine.  And now he has had The Chop. His new hair is swept back and bouffant. We\u2019re told it\u2019s for a film role about the second world war. More than that, though, it seems to set the scene for a more mature solo venture. It\u2019s a look that says: \u201cI\u2019m no longer on my gap year. I\u2019m ready for business.\u201d",
