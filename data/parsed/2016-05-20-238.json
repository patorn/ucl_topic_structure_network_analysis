When the doors open the young woman, who weighs 110kg (242lbs), has to face a crowd of passengers looking annoyed as she makes her way to take a seat. \u201cPeople look at me as if they don\u2019t want me to touch them,\u201d says the 25-year-old woman from Fernando de la Mora, a town on the outskirts of Paraguay\u2019s capital Asunci\u00f3n. She feels awful too when she shops in the capital\u2019s busy center. Store managers often tell her \u201cthere is no way this will fit you\u201d or \u201cwe don\u2019t have your size\u201d before she even says what she wants. Nearly 60% of Paraguay\u2019s population is considered overweight or obese, according to figures from the health ministry. Despite such a high rate, there is widespread discrimination against overweight people. To fight against such treatment and question beauty standards, Michael Beras organized the Miss Chubby beauty pageant for women who weigh more than 70kg. \u201cIn Paraguay, society accepts obese people only if they are on a diet,\u201d he explains.  He and his girlfriend Monica, who is overweight, took up the challenge to convey a positive image of obese people and help them integrate into society. The fashion show is the last step of a three-month program with a nutritionist, a psychologist and an image consultant. They teach the contestants how to improve their eating habits and be comfortable with their body.     The winner gets a one-year consultation with a nutritionist and a gym membership and will appear on local TV shows to promote a better image of obese people.

Romina Verna, who won the crown on 4 May, is determined to foster change in society. \u201cThis gives me the opportunity to improve this close-minded society and eliminate discrimination,\u201d she tells local TV stations. The 29-year-old won a one-year consultation with a nutritionist and a gym membership. She will appear on local TV shows to promote a better image of obese people. \u201cI never thought she could do it, take the catwalk and keep going,\u201d says her father, as he sheds a tear. The five judges deemed her the prettiest and most elegant contestant. They also assessed their improvement over the past three months on their posture, self-esteem and how seriously they took the program. As the lights fades away, ecstatic Luis Colman keeps taking pictures of his wife, who is posing in front of the cameras. \u201cI am very proud of her,\u201d he says. The body builder encouraged her to participate in Miss Chubby to boost her self-confidence. \u201cWe are all equals. My faith makes me look at people and not at their look nor what capitalism and the consumer society impose you,\u201d he says.",
