  "body": "I looked at this car and thought it was going to drive a bit wheezy and puffed out. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an assumption I have about seven-seaters, or whether I got some subliminal message from its eminently reputable face, but whatever it was, I was wrong. The Sharan is not a particularly nippy vehicle, but it has more welly than you\u2019d think, and is incredibly solid and reassuring. Obviously the point of a people carrier is not welly but wellies; can everybody fit into it with their stuff, and do they do lumbar stretches and moan when they get out? Is the middle seat big enough, not just for adults but adults who don\u2019t really know each other and would rather die than rub thighs? It is. It doesn\u2019t have a huge boot with the seats up, but if it did, it wouldn\u2019t be a car, it would be a bus. With the seats down, you could fit another car in there. The seat-flattening is incredibly intuitive and well-designed, and you finish with a space so airy, you\u2019re almost compelled to lug stuff around. The only place there isn\u2019t very much space is in the oddment stowage; but who needs a nook for your keys when you\u2019ve got a table, four chairs and a man in a hammock in your boot? It\u2019s big; you\u2019ve got that, right?

I admire its predictable edges, the fact that it doesn\u2019t stick twiddly bits anywhere and expect you to be impressed. I loved the familiarity of the cabin, so that you could close your eyes and be in a Passat \u2013 except definitely don\u2019t close your eyes, and of course, if you closed your eyes, you could be in a Skoda. Maybe it is a little staid, but \u2013 like the perfectly alert six-speed gearbox and the fine but not grippy steering \u2013 that is part of the point. People carriers that pretend they are SUVs are basically a mobile advert for how much your life has disappointed you. You should be grateful to the Sharan for looking the way it does. I had the SE NAV 2.0, a diesel engine and the greenest version, with mileage that was impressive given the size and an emissions count that was as low as it could be, unless you go back in time and have fewer children. I did the least mature driving I\u2019ve ever done, filling it so that I couldn\u2019t see the rearview or even one wing mirror, then throwing myself around the roads on one wing and a prayer, thinking: God, I\u2019m respectable.
