One was a knighted establishment figure who sold a high street chain store after taking out millions of pounds in dividends, leaving a massive pensions hole in a firm that has now collapsed, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The other is an elected member of parliament. Only one of these Greens has been spied on by the police. Is this what is meant by a democratic deficit?Dr Robert KeatsShorwell, Isle of Wight \u2022 If the junior doctors\u2019 strike is today\u2019s miners\u2019 strike (Report, 26 April) then lessons can be learned from the past. The miners lost thanks to lack of support from the trade unions; this must not be allowed to happen again. The unions must now fully get behind the junior doctors and threaten industrial action on a mass scale. The Tories view the NHS and its staff as commodities to be sold off. If the junior doctors lose, we\u2019ll be\u00a0one step further to losing our NHS for good.Bev TrounceHove \u2022 I saw nine tautologies in your article (Has M&S gone too far with its pre-cut avocado?, G2, 27 April). Every time I read \u201cpre-peeled\u201d or \u201cpre-diced\u201d I shuddered, and by the sixth paragraph a nervous tic had developed. A \u201cpre-peeled banana\u201d is a peeled banana. A \u201cpre-sliced avocado\u201d is a sliced avocado. \u201cPrepared sandwich\u201d would be bad enough; it\u2019s obviously been prepared, as it exists. To go one stage further and call it a \u201cpre-prepared sandwich\u201d is just pre-preposterous.David SawyerWoking, Surrey \u2022 \u201cMy family values: Jane Fonda, Actress\u201d (Family, 30 April). Wow. When was the last time the word \u201cactress\u201d slipped past the Guardian style guide police?Ben Staveley-TaylorOxford \u2022 What a consummate politician Nicola Sturgeon is. In the photo used with your article (Opinion, 29 April), the baby is kissing her and she doesn\u2019t have to kiss it.Helen HaranSt Albans, Hertfordshire \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
