We want to hear your stories of travelling fall outs. Have you had a major barney with your travel companion on a long trip? Ended up going your separate ways three weeks into a gap year? Or did a group trip end up \u2013 for one or more parties \u2013 as a solo journey? We want all the juicy details! Tell us what happened and how you dealt with it: did it mark the beginning of a new adventure ... or was it simply awful? Please share your stories by filling in our form below.",
