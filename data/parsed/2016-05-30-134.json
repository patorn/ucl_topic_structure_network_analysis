  "body": "Skrillex has responded to a lawsuit filed by the artist Casey Dienel which claims he and Justin Bieber stole a loop from the vocalist\u2019s song to use as part of their 2015 single, Sorry. \u201cSORRY but we didn\u2019t steal this,\u201d Skrillex tweeted on Friday, adding a video which showed how the section of the song was produced. Bieber retweeted him, adding the hashtag \u201c#wedontsteal\u201d.    SORRY but we didnt steal this \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb @justinbieber @bloodpop pic.twitter.com/9897j9sfY7\u2014 SKRILLEX (@Skrillex) May 27, 2016    Dienel, also known as White Hinterland, claims the pair used her vocal loop without permission on their No1 track. The clip in question is used repeatedly through her 2014 song Ring the Bell, and she reportedly claims that the \u201cunique characteristics of the female vocal riff\u201d have been copied.  When asked about the case, US DJ Diplo, who worked with Bieber and Skrillex on the Jack \u00dc project, told TMZ: \u201cI thought they sampled it, but I thought they cleared it. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll work out a deal with her. They don\u2019t want to go to court with it.\u201d Sorry was instrumental in launching the credible comeback of Bieber, topping the charts in countries including the US and the UK. It has been streamed more than 6.5m times on Spotify, while Ring the Bell, White Hinterland\u2019s version, has racked up 500,000. As well as Bieber and Skrillex, Sorry was written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter and Michael Tucker \u2013 all of whom are reportedly included in the lawsuit.",
