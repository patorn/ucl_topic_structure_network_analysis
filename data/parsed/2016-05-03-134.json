  "body": "One of Europe\u2019s most sought after weekend destinations, Gothenburg has evolved from an industrial port into a modern city packed with culture, fun and fabulous food.  Visitors can immerse themselves in a hipster vibe, reminiscent of Berlin or Amsterdam, while wandering through cobbled streets, exploring via canal boat or hanging out in one of the characterful boroughs: Linn\u00e9staden (also known as Linn\u00e9), Majorna and Rosenlund (the fish-packing district), which all boast independent bars, cafes and shops.   Related: Why I commute to London \u2013 from Sweden\u2019s west coast    Situated on the west coast of Sweden, fresh fish and seafood arrive in Gothenburg every morning; there\u2019s a buzzing cafe and coffee shop scene \u2013 and seven Michelin-starred restaurants. The jewel of G\u00f6taplatsen (the city\u2019s public square) is the Gothenburg Museum of Art, which houses collections from the 15th century onwards. A tour of the Gothenburg archipelago, a short boat ride from the mainland, is breathtaking. If you\u2019d love to explore Gothenburg and West Sweden, enter this competition for your chance to win a fantastic three-night break. The prize includes two return flights from the UK and a hire car, to be collected from the airport upon arrival. ItineraryThe lucky winner will head to Salt & Sill on Kl\u00e4desholmen, known as \u201cHerring Island\u201d, for the first night. Sweden\u2019s first floating hotel, it opened in 2008 after being constructed at a nearby quay in Wallhamn to avoid disrupting the island\u2019s calm. Salt & Sill is also a restaurant, with a menu inspired by local ingredients and coastal influences. Enjoy the fresh fish, shellfish and specialty \u201cherring plate\u201d, served with an uninterrupted sea view. After a peaceful night at Salt & Sill, including breakfast, the winner can explore Kl\u00e4desholmen, an old fishing community dating back to the 15th century, before driving on to Gothenburg. In the city, competition winners can relax over two nights at the central Clarion Hotel Post. A trendy venue set in an old post office, the original architecture has been preserved alongside a new section that includes a spa, two bars and rooftop pool. There are two restaurants, the Norda Bar & Grill, a fusion of New York and Gothenburg cuisines, and vR\u00c5, serving sushi and raw food. A nutritious and filling breakfast buffet is also included.
