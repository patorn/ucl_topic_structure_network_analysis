An inquiry established by Labour\u2019s former policy chief, the MP for Dagenham, Jon Cruddas, and backed by pressure groups from the right and left of the party, as well as the Fabian Society and Co-operative party, concludes that, unless lessons are learned from last year\u2019s general election disaster and this month\u2019s local election results, Labour\u2019s prospects will \u201cremain very poor\u201d. Labour\u2019s Future, Why Labour Lost in 2015 and How it Can Win Again, to be published this week, says the party is losing socially conservative voters to Ukip in droves, while appealing most to metropolitan liberals who tend to be better off and to have been to university. Labour\u2019s major challenge, the report argues, is to find a way to rebuild a coalition of support. It needs to \u201cstop patronising socially conservative Ukip voters and recognise the ways in which Ukip appeals to former Labour voters\u201d, the report says, adding: \u201cLabour is becoming a toxic brand. It is perceived by voters as a party that supports an \u2018open door\u2019 approach to immigration, lacks credibility on the economy, and is a \u2018soft touch\u2019 on welfare spending.\u201d At present, the report argues, Labour is \u201clargely a party of progressive, social liberals who value principles such as equality, sustainability, and social justice. It is losing connection with large parts of the voter population who are either pragmatists in their voting habits or social conservatives who value family, work, fairness and their country.\u201d It adds: \u201cLabour is becoming dangerously out of touch with the electorate and ... unwilling to acknowledge this growing estrangement.\u201d While it says Sadiq Khan\u2019s success in becoming mayor of London was a triumph, there is no reason to conclude that the party is on the brink of a national revival. \u201cKhan won in London with a strong mayoral campaign that married fairness themes with a pro-business and aspirational message. But just outside the M25, in socially conservative Thurrock, Labour continued to haemorrhage support, losing four council seats to Ukip in what is Labour\u2019s number eight target seat for the general election,\u201d the report says. \u201cLabour\u2019s performance in direct contests against the Conservatives was abject when compared with what would be expected of an opposition at this point in the electoral cycle.\u201d The study drew on extensive polling and analysis, and looked at Labour\u2019s performance among different \u201cvalue groups\u201d. First were the \u201cpioneers\u201d, of socially liberal, often metropolitan voters; the \u201cprospectors\u201d were pragmatic and aspirational, generally unattached voters who tend to choose the party that will do best for their financial circumstances; a third, the \u201csettlers\u201d, were socially conservative, concerned with home, family and national security. They tend to be older and are deserting the party. The report says that Labour is now as toxic in the south of England as the Tories are in the north: 43% of voters in the south said they would never vote Labour, while the same percentage in the north said they would never vote Tory. \u201cThe full significance of this for Labour is the fact that it must win 27 seats in the south to gain a majority of one [at the next general election] on a uniform national swing,\u201d the report says. It also finds that Labour is failing to appeal to the over-60s, the age group that is the likeliest to vote \u2013 45% say that they will never vote Labour and 30% say they will never vote for the Conservatives. \u201cUnless Labour detoxifies its brand with the grey vote, it will find it all but impossible to win a majority again,\u201d the report says. On a more optimistic note, it offers some hope to Labour in Scotland. Despite the party\u2019s dreadful election performances in recent elections there, the report finds that it is the least toxic party north of the border.",
