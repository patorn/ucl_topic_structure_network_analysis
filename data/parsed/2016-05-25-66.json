  "body": "The Top Gear presenter Chris Evans has said he had to endure a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of criticism from the tabloid press in the run-up to the top-rating BBC2 show\u2019s return on Sunday. Evans, who was given the job of reinventing the motoring series following the axing of Jeremy Clarkson, hit back at claims \u2013 mainly made in the Sun \u2013 that he was unhappy with the signing of co-presenter Matt LeBlanc, that he had forced out a senior executive from the show and was \u201cout of control\u201d. \u201cI thought it was ultimately funny,\u201d Evans told the Guardian of the criticism that mounted since he was given the Top Gear job nearly a year ago. \u201cSome of \u2013 almost all \u2013 of the observations from certain aspects of the press have been so nonsensical and so facile and fictitious \u2026 All the people they were talking about in lots of the stories know the truth.\u201d A combative Evans \u2013 who was speaking at the new series\u2019 press launch, to which the Sun and its Murdoch stablemate the Times were excluded \u2013 said he would be disappointed if the new show is not watched by more than 5m viewers. Asked whether the press hostility was because of him, the BBC, or the fact he was replacing Clarkson, Evans said it was all those reasons. \u201cI think it\u2019s the perfect storm,\u201d the Radio 2 DJ said. \u201cIf that\u2019s your business to write these stories, this has got to be juicy. I think they had to go for it; in a way that\u2019s their job. Do I respect them for it? Do I like them for it? That\u2019s sort of not an issue.\u201d           Chris Evans on the new series of Top Gear    When the allegations first surfaced, Evans said he told his team: \u201cThis is how it is, don\u2019t worry, this has happened to me in the past. It\u2019s only going to get worse, we are a big target so we are easy to hit. But it\u2019s our job to step out of the way, so you don\u2019t throw a punch and they fall over. \u201cI think they were looking for a bite and the one thing you do is don\u2019t bite. You never defend yourself because that\u2019s always going to be misconstrued. You hope maybe that other people defend you perhaps but the best way to respond to it all is to know you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d Last month the BBC took the unusual step of accusing the Sun of printing \u201cunfounded nonsense about Chris on a weekly, sometimes daily basis\u201d. Asked about comparisons that would inevitably be drawn with the old Top Gear \u2013 and Clarkson\u2019s new show on Amazon Prime with Richard Hammond and James May \u2013 Evans said: \u201cI am a different person to Jeremy. I think Jeremy\u2019s hilarious, I am not like that. It\u2019s the old phrase, you have to be yourself, everyone else is taken. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re dead in the water. \u201cI think we\u2019ve produced the best show we can produce, that\u2019s all we can do. It\u2019s out there, if people like us great, if people don\u2019t, we need to sneak off into the shadows. \u201cIf we had to guess about the number of viewers we are going to get on Sunday night, you have got to say you would be disappointed if it was under 5 million. Five million-plus would be great, after that it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d     Rory Reid, Chris Evans, The Stig, Matt LeBlanc, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris. Photograph: BBC World Wide    The global launch of the new show, at its Surrey studios on Wednesday, was without the former Friends star LeBlanc, who programme-makers said was filming the BBC2 sitcom Episodes. The star appeared in a video message instead. LeBlanc said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that the show continues to prompt so much global interest, even before we have shown the first episode. I\u2019ve had an amazing and crazy few months since joining Top Gear. We\u2019ve accomplished a lot and I\u2019m extremely proud of it.\u201d He said earlier this week that suggestions of a feud with Evans were a \u201cbig load of bullshit\u201d. The success of the new lineup is crucial to the BBC and its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, and worth around \u00a350m a year. Along with its return on BBC2 on Sunday, it will air in 83 countries on six continents within 72 hours of its UK debut.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big audition for us,\u201d said Evans. \u201cWe hope it\u2019s going to be popular across the territories; we will know within 72 hours of the show being broadcast,\u201d he said. The first episode features supercars covered in laser guns, a race across the Moroccan wilds and a UK v USA challenge in which Evans and LeBlanc race in two roofless Reliant Rialtos from London to Blackpool. The two presenters are part of an all-new lineup that also includes German racing driver Sabine Schmitz, former Formula 1 boss Eddie Jordan and motoring journalist Chris Harris.           Top Gear\u2019s The Stig: the Guardian\u2019s hard-hitting interview    Guest celebrities no longer drive a \u201creasonably priced car\u201d but a specially modified Mini Cooper around a track that includes a rally section and a jump. The new set has raised viewing platforms on either side, a balcony and a giant video wall.  A BBC3 spin-off programme, Extra Gear, will be fronted by Harris and another of the show\u2019s new hosts, Rory Reid, and will go live on the BBC iPlayer at the end of the BBC2 show. Jordan, the racing boss turned F1 pundit, predicted the new series would eclipse the viewing figures for the old Top Gear, which was watched by between 5 million and 6 million viewers for its last series in 2015. \u201cI know Jeremy [Clarkson] particularly well and I\u2019m a huge fan, I like him,\u201d said Jordan.  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to be absolutely so much better. I think this will be a very different show. They had a very successful past and I think you will find this show will be more successful to a wider audience.\u201d Evans said the new show would focus on the cars, which he said had become less important in recent series of Top Gear.  He said the main appeal of the show would be the films. \u201cThe films are about capers, a gang show, having a right laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully it will be a hit worldwide but we\u2019ve got to wait and see.\u201d",
