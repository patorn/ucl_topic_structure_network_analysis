  "body": "Arsenal have confirmed the arrival of Granit Xhaka from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach as their first major signing of the summer, with the Switzerland international having signed for an undisclosed fee believed to be an initial \u00a325m. Negotiations with the Bundesliga club have been on-going over the last few weeks and M\u00f6nchengladbach have accepted a fee that could rise in future. The 23-year-old, who made his name at FC Basel before moving to Germany four years ago, had indicated a desire to move to England with Arsenal looking to bolster their central midfield ranks with both Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini to be released when their contracts expire at the Emirates Stadium this summer.

The Swiss passed his medical at London Colney last week and has now finalised personal terms. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to be joining Arsenal,\u201d said Xhaka in a statement on Arsenal\u2019s website. \u201cI cannot wait to move to London, represent this special club and play in the Premier League. I will give everything to help Arsenal win trophies and make the fans happy.\u201d He later added: \u201cI like the style of football in the Premier League. It\u2019s aggressive and I like the way Arsenal play football. It\u2019s not like other countries. In Germany you can play aggressively but the referee will always blow his whistle, but in England that\u2019s not the case. That\u2019s better for me. I\u2019m an aggressive player and also a leader. I\u2019m only 23 but I captained a good team in Germany. \u201cWhen I was younger, even though I had a big brother, my parents would give me the house key every day. It\u2019s in my head that I am a leader and captaining M\u00f6nchengladbach was very good for me.\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, said: \u201cGranit Xhaka is an exciting young player, already with good Champions League and Bundesliga experience. We have been watching him for a long time now and he is a player who will add quality to our squad. We wish Granit a good Euro 2016 with Switzerland and look forward to welcoming him to Arsenal ahead of next season.\u201d Xhaka had indicated he wanted his future clarified before the European Championship finals and was granted a standing ovation by Borussia\u2019s supporters in his final appearance for the club, a 2-0 victory at Darmstadt which secured a fourth-placed finish, last week. The midfielder has been capped 40 times and will play against his parents\u2019 homeland, Albania, in the opening group game at Euro 2016. His older brother, Taulant Xhaka, will represent Albania.",
