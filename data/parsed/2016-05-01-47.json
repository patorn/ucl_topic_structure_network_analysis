  "body": "There are an estimated 26,000 child refugees in Europe as a result of recent international crises. Many are living in conditions of absolute desperation \u2013 hungry, cold, scared and, according to Europol, increasingly exposed to trafficking and sexual exploitation. We were therefore extremely disappointed that a proposal to accept 3,000 refugee children was defeated in the Commons. The proposal has been on the table since the middle of last year. During that time, it is estimated that at least 10,000 displaced children have gone missing after entering Europe. Our government\u2019s response to the plight of children, isolated and afraid in makeshift camps from Lesbos to Calais, should be focused entirely on their best interest. Increasing aid to the regions in conflict is well and good. But ignoring children already in Europe \u2013 or cheese-paring our support through lengthy bureaucratic processes \u2013 is simply unacceptable. Allowing child refugees to be left in inhuman and dangerous conditions is not only against the spirit and letter of universal and European human rights conventions, the convention on the rights of the child to which the UK is signatory, and the UK\u2019s Children Act. It risks undermining the UK\u2019s moral authority in the quest to confront radicalisation and build international security. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health urges the government to reconsider its decision, take a leadership role within Europe in addressing the larger crisis of unaccompanied child refugees and, for those refugee children already residing in the UK, facilitate the reunification of all children separated from family.Bhanu Williams (Global officer), Professor Neena Modi (President), Sebastian Taylor (Head of global operations) Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health \u2022 Liz Clegg is a fantastic example of the British people helping in Calais (Report, 29 April). Save the Children has trained 100 brilliant volunteers working in the Calais refugee camp in psychological first aid, sharing our experience of helping traumatised victims of war. Save the Children funds grassroots charities in Calais, including Jungle Books Library and Baloo\u2019s Youth Centre, which works with hundreds of vulnerable children in the camp, and supports Help Refugees Citizens UK in its excellent work. Our focus in Calais is the lone children who are forced to gamble \u2013 and sometimes lose \u2013 their lives, trying to reach their family. Improving conditions in the camp is crucial, but we need more than a plaster on the catastrophic wound in Europe\u2019s refugee response. The camp has become a no man\u2019s land between the fifth and sixth richest nations, and requires a political solution. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking the government to match its tremendous leadership of aid for the long-running Syria crisis with help for just 3,000 refugee children already in Europe. These children have a choice between the traffickers or the train tracks. MPs can offer them hope and safety when the child refugee vote returns to the Commons \u2013 it would be to their eternal credit if they did.
