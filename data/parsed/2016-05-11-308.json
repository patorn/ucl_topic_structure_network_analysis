Related: England women\u2019s cricket will be a harsher world without Charlotte Edwards | Mike Selvey    Edwards, the country\u2019s record run-scorer and a veteran of 309 caps in a career spanning 20 years, announced her retirement from international cricket at Lord\u2019s on Wednesday after being informed of Robinson\u2019s decision by Clare Connor, the head of the women\u2019s game and her predecessor as captain, last week. The 36-year-old had hoped to continue playing for England, only to be forced into a rethink when, to her shock, Robinson informed her that she would not be selected for the upcoming series with Pakistan and West Indies with a view to blooding younger players under new leadership. \u201cIt has been the hardest week of my life,\u201d said Edwards, who scored more than 10,000 international runs and captained England a record 220 times over 10 years. \u201c[Robinson] thinks there is not a place for me in the team. With that in mind, I went away, had a big think about things and this is the right thing for me and the team. \u201cMy world has been upside down for a week. It has been my life for 20 years. For me this is closure. The most important thing is for the England team to move on. Mark feels some of the younger players, and the younger batters in particular, have been hiding behind me at times. That was a phrase he used.\u201d Edwards, who led England to win three Ashes series, the World Cup and World Twenty20 titles in 2009 and was central to a new professional era of contracts for the women\u2019s team, claimed she was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with Robinson\u2019s decision to stand her down from the role despite hoping to go out after the World Cup on home soil in 2017.

I could have said today that I would be fighting to win my place back, as I plan to continue playing, but after a lot of thought I\u2019ve decided that would not be right for me or for the team.\u201d Robinson, the former Sussex head coach who was hired by Connor in November last year to shake up the team after a period of apparent stagnation by the team, was critical of their performance after the semi-final defeat to Australia during the recent World Twenty20 in India, claiming they needed to \u201cget fitter\u201d and \u201ctoughen up a little bit\u201d.

She added: \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed and upset that I can\u2019t go on that future journey with the players, but I\u2019ve had an incredible career over the past 20 years and I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by all the messages that I\u2019ve already received. Becoming a role model for girls coming into cricket is the best thing for me when I reflect on my England career. My own personal record is nothing compared to that, really.\u201d",
