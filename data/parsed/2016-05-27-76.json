  "body": "This is Corby, Northamptonshire, population 65,400, twinned, at least according to the Chinese embassy, with Shijiazhuang, China, population 10.7 million. That may seem like a mismatch, but Corby is doing its best to catch up with its Chinese twin. It has been named by the Office for National Statistics as the fastest-growing borough outside London, with a population that is expected to surge by nearly 17% to 76,400 by 2024. In the event that its sister town in China stagnates, Corby is on course to reach parity some time in the year 2346. Unlikely as that may be, the Northamptonshire town\u2019s revival has been phoenix-like, emerging anew from the ashes of post-industrial decay.  The current crisis affecting the British steel industry will resonate with those older locals who witnessed the collapse of the town\u2019s steelworks. The vast British Steel plant \u2013 formerly Stewarts & Lloyds steelworks \u2013 employed nearly 11,500 people when it closed in 1980.     Corby\u2019s town centre has been regenerated. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images    Most were part of a wave of migrant steelworkers from Scotland \u2013 and to a lesser extent Ireland and the Welsh valleys. Their arrival transformed the town from a village of 1,500 people into a busy and thriving industrial town. When the steelworks shut down, the town was left devastated as thousands of people were left with neither jobs nor hope. Tata Steel still makes tubes in Corby but that is now under threat as the Indian conglomerate that owns the plant seeks a buyer for its UK operations. While those dark times are far from forgotten, the past decade has been characterised by regeneration, renewal and reinvention. But that\u2019s not to say that there haven\u2019t been setbacks even in recent years. Residents have recently witnessed the collapse of several major employers. The yacht maker Fairline Boats sank into administration last year at the cost of hundreds of jobs at its Corby site, while more than 100 people were made redundant when the menswear brand Acquascutum closed its factory in 2012. Solway Foods, once one of the town\u2019s biggest employers, axed about 900 people in 2014.   Corby   Nonetheless, the Corby juggernaut has simply refused to stop rolling along. Where once its numbers were swollen by Scottish steelworkers, it is now welcoming two new groups \u2013 suburbanite commuters and migrant workers from the EU. A pivotal moment was the opening of Corby railway station in 2009, ending the town\u2019s reputation as the largest place in western Europe without a rail link. The new station put the town a fraction over an hour from London St Pancras, making it a viable home for people working in the capital. So keen was the town to attract some of those commuters that it briefly rebranded itself Corby, North Londonshire, in a tongue-in-cheek advertising campaign voiced by Stephen Fry. Thanks to the campaign, or perhaps in spite of it, Corby\u2019s expansion has continued at a rate of knots. The council leader, Labour\u2019s Tom Beattie, says he and his colleagues took a conscious decision to pursue regeneration through population growth, with the aim of having 100,000 residents by 2030. \u201cAfter the steelworks closed there was a feeling that the place was going nowhere, that we were managing decline,\u201d he says. \u201cWe felt growth would bring benefits to Corby.\u201d A string of high-profile regeneration projects have followed. The \u00a332m Corby Cube building opened its doors in 2010, a huge concrete and glass civic centre boasting a 450-seat theatre, public library, register office and a new council chamber. The \u00a320m Corby international swimming pool welcomed its first visitors in the same year, while the new Savoy cinema began screening films last year. The nearby town centre, including the \u00a340m Willow Place shopping centre, bustles with shoppers and all but a few sites are occupied and doing a brisk trade. Big-name brands such as Primark, H&M and TK Maxx are already bringing in shoppers from nearby towns. Sovereign Centros, the property company that owns the town centre, is planning to revamp those parts of the town that have yet to undergo a full makeover. The company says there is still plenty of pent-up demand for retail, office and residential space.     The Corby Cube.

The 50-metre pool \u2013 and an enterprise centre for small businesses \u2013 was funded by receipts from the sale of land to housing developers. Using population growth to fund regeneration has proved a successful model for a town trying to reinvent itself after the loss of heavy industry. Tim Howe, the director of the local estate agent Howe Residential, has seen the ongoing renaissance through the lens of housing demand. \u201cCorby has had a bad reputation in the past but that\u2019s changing. There must be something good going on here because Marks & Spencer is coming,\u201d he says. But the lure of Corby goes beyond its imminent access to upmarket sandwiches. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of new enquiries coming from further south, not necessarily people moving here from London but coming from the suburbs because of the house price explosion down there,\u201d says Howe. \u201cYou could move out of a local authority flat down there and buy a four- or five-bedroom house here.\u201d Like the Scottish steelworkers before them, Howe has witnessed the arrival of job-hunting migrants who now call Corby home. \u201cNow there\u2019s an influx of people from eastern Europe working on the outskirts in industrial estates, food processing plants and that kind of thing,\u201d he says.

Howe says he hasn\u2019t witnessed much tension between longstanding Corby residents and arrivals either from Greater London or the outer reaches of the EU. But his optimism isn\u2019t mirrored everywhere. One former steelworker sporting a Scotland football shirt, who asked not to be named, said he felt Corby was being targeted by immigrants who see it as a \u201csoft touch\u201d because of its growth ambitions. And there\u2019s no doubt that population growth, regardless of where it comes from, will put pressure on local infrastructure, school places and GP surgeries. \u201cPeople from far and wide are trying to get their children into the best schools here, so there is pressure on school places, particularly for infants and juniors,\u201d says Howe. Beattie says he is aware of both the logistical and cultural tensions that come with immigration. For new schools and medical centres, he is looking in large part to housing developments, such as the 5,000-home Priors Hall project on the edge of town, to provide the facilities to match the growing population. When it comes to integration, he hopes that Corby will draw on its reputation as a friendly part of the world. He points to the success of the town\u2019s first major wave of migration from Scotland. \u201cThere\u2019s a spirit in Corby, which welcomes outsiders,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there has to be sensitivity to the existing population so that they feel they\u2019re not being manoeuvred out of jobs.\u201d",
