I remember my hero, Jack Ashley, expressing his wish for all schoolchildren to learn simple finger spelling. Surely this should be an essential skill.

I always wondered why the National Portrait Gallery was full of oil paintings.Jem WhiteleyOxford  \u2022 When the Queen reaches 100, who will be sending her a telegram?Tony BashfordCarlisle",
