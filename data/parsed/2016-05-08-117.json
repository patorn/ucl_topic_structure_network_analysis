They may have been too young to have taken part in the 1969 uprising that began when lesbian and gay patrons fought back during a police raid, but they were acutely aware of the place in history that the bar enjoys. So is Barack Obama. According to reports, the president is poised to declare the tiny, railed garden opposite the inn and some surrounding streets a national monument, in tribute to the struggle for gay equality that began there, then turned into a worldwide movement. On Monday, the interior secretary, Sally Jewell, will hold meetings with veterans of the riots and local officials. An announcement could come as early as June, to coincide with the annual gay pride march that commemorates the Stonewall riots. \u201cIf they build an actual monument, I hope it\u2019s made out of the bricks that were thrown at the police,\u201d said Lady Bunny, a drag queen, DJ, promoter, TV star and founder of the now-defunct Wigstock drag parades in the East Village who is almost never known by her legal name, Jon Ingle.  \u201cAnd wigs, and psychedelic fabric, and syringes and Judy Garland album covers: it needs to evoke that raucous night when the freaks fought back. It was led by the hustlers and crazies, outsiders even amongst gays, who had nothing to lose.\u201d In fact, national monument status gives protection from destruction and development to \u201cobjects of historic or scientific interest\u201d. The Stonewall Inn already has a physical marker of what happened 47 years ago: a sculpture of two couples by George Segal, sited in Christopher Park. \u2018I saw them push this guy. They didn\u2019t know it was a woman\u2019     A demonstration in early 1970s, in the wake of the Stonewall riots.

Within days, the uprising changed from localized civil disobedience to a riot. Then came a spontaneous protest march, from Greenwich Village to Central Park. Those who walked were called every slur under the sun, but they kept on, setting an example not just for those who take part in the pride marches and parades of today, but for thousands of demonstrations and tiny acts of defiance that often meet with violent consequences. The Stonewall\u2019s barman identifies himself as Fredd E Tree \u2013 though he is universally known just as Tree, for his towering stature. Now 77, he was there that night in 1969, he said in a phone call, \u201cdancing the lindy hop with my queer friends\u201d. On Monday, Tree will meet Secretary Jewell. Of the push to declare the area a national monument, he said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a marvellous idea. I hope people can get to vote on what kind of monument or or marker they would like to see here.\u201d At the time of the riot, Tree lived in Bushwick. He was known as a tough gang member who was nonetheless devoted to making frequent visits to his grandmother. In fact, he wasn\u2019t visiting granny. He was sneaking into Manhattan, to go to the Stonewall and other gay venues. Then, the main barroom adjoined the building next door, where there is now a nail salon. The current bar space led off that room, via an arch. That was where Tree was dancing in the early hours of 28 June 1969, when he heard and saw a commotion through the archway. It was a police raid. \u201cI saw them push this guy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know it was actually a woman, Storm\u00e9, and she turned around and hit the cop.\u201d  Reports of details and even some names vary, but the room quickly descended into a chaos of pushing and punching. The Stonewall uprising was led by drag queens but the first punch was thrown by a butch lesbian. Storm\u00e9 DeLaverie died in 2014, at the age of 93. She was a fixture on the scene for decades and in 1969 often performed as a male impersonator or drag king \u2013 an illegal act at the time.    My friends and I ran out when the fighting started and then we picked up rocks and started hurling them at the bar  Fredd E Tree, bartender     The mafia, Tree said, ran New York\u2019s gay bars. On the night in question, the police did not raid the Stonewall to arrest homosexuals. The vice squad was after mafia bosses for laundering money and dodging licensing regulations. Raids were not uncommon, but they usually consisted of a shakedown and a few arrests by cops from the local precinct. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Come on, girls, wind it up,\u2019\u201d Tree said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t usually too violent, but we were still all sick of it. That night, when the vice squad came in with night sticks, yelling and shoving, the \u201cgirls\u201d snapped and just \u201cwent nuts\u201d, he said. \u201cMy friends and I ran out of a side door when the fighting started and then we picked up rocks from the park opposite and started hurling them at the bar.\u201d Some guys pulled up a parking meter and threw that. People came from other local venues and apartments and the uprising swelled. People began jumping on police patrol cars and breaking windows. By this time, the cops were barricaded inside the bar. \u201cWhen we ran out of ammunition, we started setting trash cans alight and throwing those,\u201d Tree said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the police riot squad arrived, because of course you cannot set fire to a bar with cops in it.\u201d He recalled injured protestors being treated in nearby Washington Square Park and Quakers from the local church coming to help. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Quakers still march at Pride every year and get a huge cheer,\u201d he said. There were several more nights of rioting. The following weekend culminated in a spontaneous protest march. \u201cI went down to the Stonewall with some friends and someone said, \u2018We\u2019re going to walk to Central Park,\u2019\u201d Tree said. \u201cI said, \u2018For what?\u2019 But I started walking with everyone anyway.  \u201cWell, as we walked, people came out on to the sidewalks and yelled at us, \u2018Queer, fag, dyke, lezzie\u2019. By the time we got to the park, gays were giving speeches.\u201d \u2018Obama has done more than all his predecessors put together\u2019     Australia Kimbrough and Tonhya Wysong at the Stonewall Inn, New York.

Less than 50 years later, the supreme court legalized same-sex marriage. \u201cStonewall was the event where gay people finally stood up and fought back in a way they never had in New York before,\u201d said Charles Kaiser, author of The Gay Metropolis, an acclaimed chronicle of American gay life from 1940 to 1996. \u201cThe speed with which things changed after that is astonishing. Gays have improved their status in the world more quickly and dramatically in just one generation than any other minority group in modern history.\u201d The battle for equality is, however, far from over, Kaiser said, whether it involves battling attempts to enshrine discrimination in law or highlighting the lack of laws to prevent it. \u201cBut Obama has done far more for the cause of gay liberation than all his predecessors put together,\u201d Kaiser said. \u201cIt would certainly add to his legacy to commemorate the spot that has been revered as sacred by gays for decades.\u201d As Lady Bunny put it, the Stonewall Inn is \u201ca dump that hasn\u2019t been cleaned since the riots and never got the gentrification memo\u201d. But it has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999 and a National Historic Landmark since 2000, thus escaping the fate of the legendary CBGB on the Bowery, the \u201ccradle of punk\u201d, which closed in 2006, to be turned into an expensive boutique. In 2015, the Stonewall Inn was made a landmark building by New York City.  Those at the bar agreed that national monument status, decreed by a president who stunned even the community itself when he mentioned gay equality in his first inauguration speech, would be on another level altogether. In discussing it, some mentioned a later landmark in gay history: the Aids crisis of the 1980s.     Lady Bunny, seen here with Benjamin Walker at the Schoenfeld Theatre in New York. Photograph: Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic    \u201cThere was bloodshed on this spot,\u201d said Chauncey Dandridge, Lady Bunny\u2019s sound engineer, as he packed up his kit.  \u201cMaybe if the Stonewall Inn had been made a national monument within the first decade after the riots, Ronald Reagan would have had to have done something when HIV came along and wouldn\u2019t have turned his back on it in the way he did, and we would have been further along in our rights much earlier.\u201d Joe Kenavan, 56, said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. I feel very honored by the idea. I was too young for the riots, though I remember hearing about them at the time as a kid growing up in New York with a crush on other boys. \u201cI was really around through the Aids era, such a horrific time \u2013 and we are just a handful of the lucky ones; most of our generation were wiped out \u2013 and the government was ignoring us when we really needed help.\u201d Brenda Bergman, 62, straight but a fan of all things gay, said she would like to see a sculpture in the park opposite the bar \u2013 where Segal\u2019s work stands \u2013 that echoed the iconic photograph of US marines raising the stars and stripes on Iwo Jima, \u201cbut instead with drag queens raising the rainbow flag\u201d.    It\u2019s too little, too late. I don\u2019t think it reflects what we had to endure, I think the politicians are grandstanding  Joey Solorio       There were some dissenting voices. Joey Solorio, a volunteer at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center, sipped a beer at the bar. He said he worried that national monument status could lead to the equivalent of \u201cDisneyfication\u201d in that corner of the West Village. He also said it was a token and even a sham. \u201cIt\u2019s too little, too late,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it reflects our life or what we have had to endure. I think the politicians are grandstanding.\u201d Others are inclined to agree. But two young women sipping drinks and holding hands in the main bar downstairs were not among them. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d said Australia Kimbrough, 26, a fashion designer out on a date with Tonhya Wysong, a 28-year-old photographer. The women had first met at the bar, they said, five weeks before. \u201cI know the history of this place and how it helped our generation,\u201d Kimbrough said. \u201cIt should be acknowledged nationally.\u201d Why had they come to the Stonewall? \u201cI still feel more comfortable on a date here,\u201d said Kimbrough, \u201csurrounded by gays and positive energy, not being judged. We love it here and it means so much.\u201d  This article was amended on 9 May 2016, to more correctly reflect ongoing debate around responsibility for starting the Stonewall riots",
