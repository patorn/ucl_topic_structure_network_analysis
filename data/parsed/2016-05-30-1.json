  "body": "Remember when Joe Hockey promised jobs and growth by lifting female workforce participation?\u00a0 In 2014, the former treasurer proclaimed that Australia could grow the economy by $25bn a year by matching Canada\u2019s female workforce participation rate \u2013 which is just four percentage points higher than Australia. To formalise his commitment, Hockey signed Australia up to a G20 goal to reduce the gender gap in participation rates by 25% by 2025. Wow! By 2025, we will not only match our northern neighbours, but more importantly, we will also exceed our G20 goal, get more women working, and expand the economy by tens of billions.\u00a0 Bring on the jobs and growth! \u00a0 Or not. Along came Treasury to rain on Hockey\u2019s women\u2019s workforce participation parade.\u00a0 The 2015 Intergenerational Report estimates that Australia will not meet its G20 female workforce participation target by 2025. Or by 2035. Or by 2045. Or even by 2055. (After that, even Treasury stops counting.)\u00a0 So, when Joe Hockey said \u201cwe need to do everything we can to be as flexible and accommodating of the needs of a diverse workforce as possible\u201d he really meant everything, except anything that would actually make a difference. Of course, Joe Hockey and his boss, Tony Abbott are yesterday\u2019s men. The Coalition made the brave choice last September to roll the former minister for women, Tony Abbott, and replace him with Michaelia Cash. At least Cash is doing what she can to ensure that women have every opportunity to be employed. Last week she stood up for women by refusing to support domestic violence leave as a universal workplace right,\u00a0warning that employers might use such leave as a \u201cperverse disincentive\u201d\u00a0\u00a0to employ women. I wonder if employers might use the fact that one in six Australian women are the victims of physical or sexual violence\u00a0at the hands of their partners as a disincentive to hire female employees. After all, showing up at work bruised and battered can\u2019t be good for productivity.\u00a0 But hey, good on Cash for doing something, even clumsily and foolishly, to try to promote women\u2019s workforce participation. No one else in the \u201cjobs and growth\u201d Turnbull team seems to be lifting a finger.\u00a0 Scott Morrison\u2019s national economic plan for jobs and growth, aka budget 2016, contains six points (according to him \u2013 I count eight points, but hey, who says a treasurer needs to be good with numbers?). \u00a0 Not one of these points explicitly addresses female workforce participation. \u00a0 Social services minister, Christian Porter, and minister for education and training, Simon Birmingham,\u00a0released the jobs for families childcare package in late 2015.\u00a0 They tied it to a family tax benefit bill that had no hope of getting through the Senate. Turns out a majority of senators didn\u2019t want to take money away from one set of parents in order to give it to different parents. \u00a0 Since December, these two ministers have made zero progress at securing passage of this supposedly important reform. \u00a0 Before losing his job as minister for women, Abbott wound back his ridiculously generous and friendless paid parental leave policy. Then Porter and Morrison kept winding and winding back to stop the mothers of Australia from rorting by double dipping on paid parental leave \u2013 even though this is exactly how the program was designed to operate. Even though the wives of their ministerial colleagues Josh Frydenberg and Mathias Cormann were outed by their husbands for using this apparent \u201crort\u201d. What\u2019s good for the goose isn\u2019t good for the gander, apparently.\u00a0But it\u2019s not good for the Senate either, who have refused to pass the Coalition\u2019s changes to paid parental leave. But the Turnbull Coalition is still planning to curtail paid parental leave in its national plan for jobs and growth budget.\u00a0   Related: Jessica Valenti: my life as a \u2018sex object\u2019    When I questioned human services minister Alan Tudge on Sky News about how the national plan for jobs and growth would lift female workforce participation he answered by extolling the virtues of the Coalition\u2019s company tax cut.\u00a0 Apparently a company tax cut will encourage jobs and growth meaning there will be more jobs for everyone, including women. Yippee!\u00a0 Apparently, for every dollar cut in company tax, Australia (including us women) get a $4 return to the economy. \u00a0 Bring on the jobs and growth!\u00a0 Or not. According to those Debbie Downers over at Treasury, Australia won\u2019t see the $4 return for some 20-30 years.\u00a0 You can hear the rallying cry now:\u00a0 Women, what do we want?\u00a0Jobs and growth and female workforce participation to increase by 4 percentage points!\u00a0When do we want it? In 20 to 40 years\u2019 time!",
