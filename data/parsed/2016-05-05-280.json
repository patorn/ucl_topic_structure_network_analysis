  "body": "The Canadian province of Alberta has declared a state of emergency after a raging wildfire destroyed dozens of homes, engulfed several neighbourhoods and forced the hurried evacuation of the entire city of Fort McMurray. More than 80,000 residents were ordered to leave the northern Alberta city after shifting winds saw the blaze go from being largely controlled to a \u201cnasty, ugly\u201d inferno as described by the local fire chief. By Wednesday more than 250 firefighters were fighting the fire, assisted by helicopters and air tankers. Officials estimated that 1,600 structures had been damaged or destroyed by Wednesday night. As flames fanned south on Thursday, officials also issued mandatory evacuation orders for the Anzac, Gregoire Lake Estates and Fort McMurray First Nation communities located about 50km south of Fort McMurray. After the evacuation order was issued, residents scrambling to make their way out of Fort McMurray sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the main road, struggling to see the road through the thick grey haze that blanketed the highway. Flames licked the road and ash rained down on vehicles, while air tankers and helicopters flew overhead. Gas pumps soon ran dry, leaving many residents stranded on the highway overnight. \u201c[With] the heat from the oncoming smoke and the flames, you could see mini-tornadoes forming near the road,\u201d resident Jordan Stuffco told the Canadian Press. \u201cIt was something out of an apocalyptic movie.\u201d   Map   Authorities warned that the fire, which started on Sunday, was being fanned by hot, dry and windy weather. \u201cThe worst of the fire is not over,\u201d said Bernie Schmitte of Alberta Agriculture and Forestry. \u201cWe\u2019re still faced with very high temperatures, low relative humidity and some strong winds.\u201d Hours later the raging inferno forced authorities to declare a state of emergency. The province\u2019s municipal affairs minister, Danielle Larivee, said the declaration would allow the province to better access external resources.  An accident on a nearby highway between an SUV and a tractor-trailer unit had resulted in fatalities and sparked an additional fire, added Larivee. It was not immediately clear if the accident was related to the evacuation. The driver and passenger of the SUV died on the scene.

He described the wildfire as a \u201cnasty, dirty fire\u201d that was raging out of control, that defied efforts to suppress it. \u201cThere are areas of the city that have not been burned, but this fire will look for them and it will find them, and it will try and take them.\u201d  On Tuesday 105 patients and clients \u2013 including nine newborn babies \u2013 were evacuated from city\u2019s only hospital as flames approached.           Alberta driver\u2019s dashcam footage of wildfire    With Fort McMurray the hub of the province\u2019s main oil sands region, a number of oil sands work camps nearby were turned into impromptu housing for evacuees. Neighbouring communities also reached out to residents as they fled the flames, staffing recreation centres to provide shelter and bringing gas to stranded motorists. Others made their way to the evacuation camps that had been set up outside the city or found lodging in the city of Edmonton, some 435km away, where they took stock of what they had left behind. \u201cWhen you leave \u2026 it\u2019s an overwhelming feeling to think that you\u2019ll never see your house again,\u201d Carol Christian told the Canadian Press. Along with her son and cat, she had driven to an evacuation centre. \u201cIt was absolutely horrifying when we were sitting there in traffic. You look up and then you watch all the trees candle-topping \u2026 up the hills where you live and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh my God. We got out just in time.\u2019\u201d Rachel Notley, the Alberta premier, said about 10,000 evacuees had moved north to stay in the oil sands work camps. The bulk of the evacuees fled south to Edmonton and elsewhere, and officials said they eventually would like to move everyone south. Shell said it had shut down production at its Shell Albian Sands mining operations about 60 miles north of the city so it could focus on getting families out of the region. Suncor, the largest oil sands operator, said it was reducing production at its regional facility about 15 miles north of the city. Many other companies evacuated non-essential staff. Chelsie Klassen, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said all large oil sands facilities had emergency crews and plans for forest fires, noting all personnel would be evacuated and facilities would be properly shut to minimise the damage. She noted 80% of oil sands deposits were deep underground and could only be extracted through drilling. The remaining 20% could be mined from the surface and was predominantly located north of Fort McMurray. It could burn under certain circumstances, but at a much slower pace considering its composition with sand. Municipal authorities on Wednesday began detailing the damage that had been caused by the wildfire, including one neighbourhood where 80% of the homes were destroyed. Images on social media showed the flattened neighbourhood of Beacon Hill, the rubble of its many destroyed homes strewn about. In another neighbourhood, a dozen trailers also went up in flames, while serious losses were reported in several other areas. Some in the city had as little as 30 minutes to evacuate, with many making it out with little more than their vehicle and the clothes on their back. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time for nothing,\u201d said Shawn Brett. He had been at home when his friends called to warn him of the encroaching blaze. He jumped on his Harley motorcycle and made his way out, fighting his way through the smoke and flames that had engulfed his neighbourhood. \u201cI literally drove through the flames. I had ashes hitting my face and the heat from the fire was that bad,\u201d he told the the Canadian Press. \u201cEverything was jammed. It was nothing but the biggest chaos I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, said on Wednesday he had spoken to the Premier Notley, to offer the government\u2019s support. \u201cI really do want to highlight that Canada is a country where we look out for our neighbours, and we are there for each other in difficult times,\u201d Trudeau told his Liberal caucus. \u201cAnd certainly in Fort McMurray, the difficult times they are going through right now is something that we are going to unite around.\u201d He shot down earlier comments made by Elizabeth May, the leader of Canada\u2019s Green Party, that linked the fire to the global climate crisis. \u201cOne thing we know is that with climate change there will be more extreme events,\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cBut, we know very well that placing a direct link between any fire or a flood and climate change goes a step beyond what is helpful and does not benefit a conversation we must have.\u201d The premier of Alberta said on Wednesday that she planned to head to Fort McMurray to get a firsthand look at the scope of the crisis. \u201cOur hearts are with the families who have had to leave their homes in Fort McMurray,\u201d said Notley from Edmonton. Nearby communities have sent emergency personnel and vehicles to the city. The provincial government has also been in continuous contact with other provinces and the federal government, she said, and now has the resources needed to battle the blaze. \u201cBut of course the weather is the key issue.\u201d Queen Elizabeth said she was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the news of the wildfires \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been affected, and we send our heartfelt thanks to the firefighters and the other emergency workers,\u201d she said in a statement. The wildfire comes as a devastating blow to a city already reeling from the impact of slumping oil prices, said David Yurdiga, the MP for the area. The Alberta oil sands rank as one of the world\u2019s largest reserves of oil. \u201cEven with the destruction caused by the fire thus far we will need federal funds to get back on our feet,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThis city has seen thousands of people leave their homes because of the downturn in oil. Fort McMurray cannot handle that and this wildfire.\u201d With Associated Press",
