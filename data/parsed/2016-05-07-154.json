  "body": "Crime is down,\u201d proclaims the liberal governor of Ohio in the opening scenes of the new action thriller I Am Wrath (available to stream from Monday). His assertion may be in line with statistical reality \u2013 the US crime rate has indeed fallen consistently since the mid 1990s \u2013 but as any red-blooded American can tell you, statistics can be used to prove damn near anything. The real story is to be found on the streets, or \u2013 in the case of John Travolta\u2019s unemployed family man Stanley Hill \u2013 in the multistorey car park where his wife is brutally murdered for loose change by a gang of strung-out hoodlums. After identifying the ringleader in a police lineup, Hill is confident that justice will be served, but the feeble cops would rather give the killer a lollipop for good behaviour than put him behind bars where he belongs. Again, a statistician might point out that the US is actually far from squeamish when it comes to mass incarceration, but consider this: maybe the US\u2019s prison population is not in fact the largest in the world, but the least unlargest.            Responsibility falls to Hill to avenge his wife\u2019s death and, unlike the police, he\u2019s not about to let the possibility of an endless cycle of retributive violence get in the way of what must be done. Together with Law & Order\u2019s Christopher Meloni, he sets about teaching Ohio\u2019s criminal underworld a lesson in street justice. The pair\u2019s mode of punishment is unforgiving (Hill in particular favours a \u201csquash to death with a car crusher now, ask questions later\u201d approach) but their investigative skills are surprisingly refined. Before long, they discover that the murder of Hill\u2019s wife \u2013 far from an impulsive act of barbarism \u2013 was ordered from on high, a revelation that ironically seems to confirm the governor\u2019s assertion that random street violence is a thing of the past. At least it was, until Travolta started meting out indiscriminate savagery. On the narrow spectrum of middle-aged vengeance thrillers, I Am Wrath is more low-rent Nicolas Cage flick than credible Keanu Reeves vehicle, not least in its frequent bouts of Bible-thumping (Hill is first inspired to take his revenge after reading an especially hardcore passage from the Book of Jeremiah). It may not come as a surprise to learn that Cage was originally tapped for the role, until unspecified \u201cissues\u201d forced him to withdraw from the project, handing Travolta \u2013 fresh from a career revitalising turn in American Crime Story \u2013 the role his hairline was born to play.",
