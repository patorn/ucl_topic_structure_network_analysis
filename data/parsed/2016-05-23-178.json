It was played before the Old Bailey as Ellie\u2019s mother Jennie Gray, 36, described the man accused of killing Ellie in a violent rage as having a bark worse than his bite. Graphic designer Gray insisted she and Ben Butler were not living in a \u201chouse of horrors\u201d at the time of their daughter\u2019s death in October 2013 and dismissed a stream of abusive text messages from Butler as empty threats, insisting he had never been violent towards her or Ellie. Gray said Butler was a completely devoted father and that messages in which he called her a \u201ccunt\u201d or a \u201cbitch\u201d meant nothing. She said he was never violent towards her or Ellie and the few times he had shoved her it was because she was \u201cin his face\u201d. Texts in which she begged him not to kick her out or not to beat her up were just her being \u201cbitchy\u201d or \u201cdramatic\u201d. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in an argument with someone, I can be very bitchy and very sarcastic,\u201d she said at her trial for child cruelty in relation to a broken shoulder pathologists found Ellie had suffered. Butler, 36, is on trial for murder and child cruelty in relation to Ellie\u2019s death from \u201ccatastrophic\u201d head injuries in October 2013. Butler spent time in jail in 2009 for a conviction, later overturned in the court of appeal, for assaulting Ellie as a baby. The jury has heard that Butler called his partner \u201ca dog whore\u201d and a \u201cfat dog\u201d in 2013, the year of Ellie\u2019s death, and threatened in a text: \u201cI\u2019ll maim u bitch\u201d. \u201cHis bark is definitely worse than his bite,\u201d Gray said, giving evidence for the first time. \u201cIf you look at that one [where he says] maim you, I say: look at my face; I have been maimed?\u201d she said, looking towards the jury. \u201cHe used to threaten me but they were empty threats \u2026 that\u2019s how it was.\u201d She said she never felt scared of Butler and swore that he was never violent to Ellie. \u201cWe were both very, very bad to each other, but I didn\u2019t feel threatened,\u201d she said. The jury were shown a 15-minute compilation of home videos showing Ellie playing with her parents in a park, at a school sports day and being shown how to play an arcade game by her father. In one clip, Ellie can be seen smiling and laughing in a gold Disney dress; in another, she is sitting next to her father with the family\u2019s new pet dog. Gray said she felt hormonal after a botched abortion in January 2013 and texts in which she referred to him threatening to beat her were just \u201cme being exaggerative\u201d. She said she was ashamed of the texts, telling the jury that the trial was about the death of Ellie, not their rows, which she described as childish.     Ben Butler with daughter Ellie. Photograph: David Crump/Rex/Shutterstock    Asked about one exchange in which she said Butler had kicked her in the genitals after he allegedly wanted her to mimic a pornography scene, she responded: \u201cAll I can say is: I have never been kicked by Ben Butler, let alone in the female regions.\u201d When Butler was arrested in relation to Ellie\u2019s death, police seized a computer used by Gray and found searches including: \u201cI\u2019m with a bully man who beats me and tells me I\u2019m ugly and fat and hurts me all the time.\u201dShe said: \u201cI\u2019ve never been beaten by Ben. Yes, we\u2019ve had altercations when I\u2019ve been in his face. The only thing I\u2019ve had by Ben Butler is berated but not beaten.\u201d Earlier, Gray said she tried to drink herself to death when their child was put in foster care at two months old. She said she was heartbroken and depressed but denies child cruelty in relation to the girl\u2019s death six years later.  Gray was at work in the City of London on 28 October 2013 when Butler allegedly attacked Ellie, causing catastrophic head injuries. Butler urgently called her home to Sutton, south-west London, but waited two hours before ringing 999, the Old Bailey heard. In that time, the couple allegedly destroyed evidence in an attempt to cover up the circumstances of Ellie\u2019s death.  Gray said she met Butler at her brother\u2019s birthday party in March 2006. The relationship was casual and they were both shocked when she became pregnant, but she said he supported her decision to keep the baby.     Gray and Butler. The couple allegedly destroyed evidence in an attempt to cover up the circumstances of Ellie\u2019s death. Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock    After a \u201ctraumatic\u201d birth at St Helier hospital in Sutton, Gray took Ellie back to her flat and Butler visited daily. Gray told jurors: \u201cHe was completely devoted, completely in love with the fact that he was a dad.\u201d  Ellie was put in foster care amid suspicions that she was a victim of shaken baby syndrome when Butler rushed her to hospital after she collapsed at six weeks old. Gray broke down in tears as she described the day Ellie was taken away from her in 2007.  \u201cI was walking out that door with the foster carer holding Ellie and her little head turning and watching people go out the door, and I fell on that woman\u2019s front drive because they took my baby and it took me a while to get up off that floor and the social worker sat in the car and she didn\u2019t even care; she wasn\u2019t even human,\u201d Gray told the court. Gray said she and Butler had to fight Sutton council for years in the family courts to get Ellie back. \u201cWe just had battle after battle. I went to pieces. I turned to drink after a while. I tried to drink myself to death a few times, my heart was so broken. I remember then Ben picking me up off the floor I was so drunk. I didn\u2019t want to wake up. And he said \u2018please, please survive\u2019. And he kept going, he made me survive,\u201d she told jurors. She blamed Ellie\u2019s collapse as a six-week-old on congenital abnormalities, disorders that were not diagnosed until later court cases as part of their battle to be reunited with their daughter. Raising her voice to mimic one of the doctors at St Helier, she said they were told the baby had been \u201cviolently shaken\u201d. She and Butler could not believe what they were hearing.  They were told the baby might not survive the night and, if she did, she would be in a persistent vegetative state, blind and deaf. But there was a completely different assessment from a second team of doctors who assessed Ellie. They were from a \u201cproper hospital\u201d, said Gray, referring to Evelina\u2019s children\u2019s unit in central London. The doctor said he did not think the baby was brain dead and could have collapsed because of an infection such as meningitis or \u201cnear-miss cot death\u201d.  Gray said Ellie might not have died if her abnormalities had been diagnosed earlier or if she had not been maltreated as a baby at St Helier. She claimed the hospital overdosed the baby with an adult dose of radiation during tests and that it caused injury to her baby during her birth. Butler and Gray both deny the charges.  The trial continues.",
