  "body": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez is strongly tempted by the challenge of leading Newcastle out of the Championship but despite \u201cproductive\u201d talks with Lee Charnley, the newly relegated club\u2019s managing director, on Thursday afternoon, much needs to be negotiated before any decision is reached. It is understood that Ben\u00edtez will demand written assurances of promises made during the ongoing discussions but, with his own immediate future seeming inextricably linked to that of the Spaniard, Charnley has a keen interest in persuading Steve McClaren\u2019s successor to ignore the break option in his three-year contract.   Related: If you want an example of hubris, look no further than Newcastle\u2019s boardroom | Louise Taylor    That enables Ben\u00edtez to walk away from St James\u2019 Park after his first 10 games if Newcastle suffered relegation. Though that has now happened and Sunday\u2019s match at home to Tottenham Hotspur is a mere academic footnote, the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager has been almost overwhelmed by the warmth extended to him on Tyneside and is acutely aware of the potential at one of England\u2019s doziest sleeping giants. Newcastle are understood to be willing to dismantle their failed management model and offer Ben\u00edtez the sort of control denied to McClaren and Alan Pardew. Conversely, he had not really envisaged managing in the second tier and is demanding clear, outright, autonomy over assorted club spheres including, most critically, recruitment as well as the medical department, academy and proposed re-vamp of the training ground before reaching a final decision. Despite Thursday\u2019s encouraging noises, ongoing talks are expected to extend into next week with Ben\u00edtez wanting time to think things over and verbal promises formalised on paper. Should the 56-year-old, who holds the whip hand in negotiations and will not be short of alternative offers, eventually walk away, Charnley can expect sustained calls for his head. On Thursday morning the front page headline of the Newcastle Evening Chronicle read : \u201cCharnley you\u2019ve got two jobs: keep Rafa, then go.\u201d Happily for the chief executive, Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner rarely takes much notice of media coverage and is understood to be willing to offer Charnley a last chance to put things right at a club who spent \u00a380m this season but were still relegated. Were Ben\u00edtez \u2013 who will face the media on Saturday before the Spurs game \u2013 to stay, the managing director would be almost certain to remain in post but, even if he left, Charnley could still expect to be tasked with overseeing the recruitment of an alternative. The position of Graham Carr, the powerful chief scout is rather less secure and at 71 it may be decided that the time is right for him to retire.",
