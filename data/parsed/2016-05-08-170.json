  "body": "The debut by name-to-drop Montreal producer Kaytranada (drop it thus: Kaytra-NAH-duh) is a millennial collection that flares its nostrils at genre. On paper, the Haitian-born Louis Celestin is a hip-hop-head turned remixer, gaining traction from reworking Janet Jackson. These slightly disjointed 15 tracks provide ample evidence of 360-degree skills, of house and funk steals, often undercut with the clattery skip of bass music. A woozy Anderson .Paak feature, Glowed Up, where beats fall a nanosecond out on purpose, is testament to hip-hop chops; there\u2019s also doses of post-Flying Lotus jazz, in the form of Weight Off (featuring BadBadNotGood). It\u2019s hard to keep up, then \u2013 but worth it.         Kaytranada featuring Anderson .Paak \u2013 Glowed Up",
