Everton travel to Sunderland for their final away game of the season on Wednesday with Mart\u00ednez appearing on the brink of losing his job after three seasons. Calls for a change have increased among supporters in recent weeks and a feeble display at the newly crowned champions Leicester City on Saturday did not help his claims that he retains the backing of the players. Mart\u00ednez uncharacteristically turned on his team after the 3-1 defeat at the King Power Stadium, accusing all but the inexperienced Matthew Pennington of lacking intensity and effort.   Related: Roberto Mart\u00ednez: Everton won\u2019t roll over at Sunderland    The Everton manager\u2019s press appearances have also become uncharacteristically brief since what he described as a defining week in the season yielded a shambolic defeat by Liverpool in the Merseyside derby followed by a stoppage-time loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final. He was reluctant to be drawn on his future at a pre-Sunderland press conference on Tuesday, admitting he and his players had allowed themselves to be distracted by the title celebrations at Leicester and would not repeat the mistake at the Stadium of Light. However, he denied it was a foregone conclusion that he will lose his job at Goodison Park and players, sensing as much, could not be motivated by him. \u201cThat is the manager\u2019s job,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, who will have Ramiro Funes Mori and Gareth Barry back from suspension and injury respectively at Sunderland. \u201cIf anyone wants to have a scrutiny of my job, then they are allowed to do that. If you are going to do it, then you don\u2019t do it after the games since Chelsea in the FA Cup, you do it over the last three seasons and see where we are now. You have to look at the signs. The only thing that matters to me is the game against Sunderland.\u201d Asked what signs of progress he was talking about, with Everton 12th in the Premier League, having collected the lowest number of points in their history at home this season, on the basis of three points for a win, Mart\u00ednez replied: \u201cI understand why you are asking but, honestly, the time to do that is after the Norwich game. Everything you can question me about afterwards. The only thing that matters is Sunderland. I don\u2019t help the team if I speak about something other than Sunderland.\u201d Despite some pitiful performances recently, Everton\u2019s players have escaped the fierce criticism being directed at their manager. Mart\u00ednez, however, insists key figures such as leading goalscorer Romelu Lukaku have not \u201cdowned tools\u201d as they look ahead to the European Championship. The Everton manager said: \u201cNot at all. Rom is still only 22 and young players go through new phases. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s played 47 games in a season and you have to cope with the mental fatigue of preparing from game to game. I understand no one should be happy at not winning games. I\u2019m the first one to set high standards and high expectations, and I don\u2019t expect anyone to be happy when we don\u2019t win. That\u2019s why the focus goes into Sunderland. We want to finish strong. \u201cWe put a lot of effort into the cup competitions and that is going to affect you a little bit in the league. That happens. It happened last year when we were in the Europa League. This season, since the quarter-final against Chelsea, we have not been ourselves in the league. We have not been at our level. That is not down to one or two individuals. It is the reality of how the season has panned out. The second half against Manchester United, we played our hearts out. That\u2019s how close we were to getting that little bit of success you need to make the next step.\u201d",
