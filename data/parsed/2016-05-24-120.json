Halfords is paying \u00a318.4m for the Swansea-based online retailer which specialises in premium bikes and accessories, with the figure topped up in a year\u2019s time if the business performs as expected. Other equity-owning management will receive some of the cash. The Halfords chief executive, Jill McDonald, said the deal would expand the retailer\u2019s presence in the online market for premium bikes, parts, accessories and clothing. \u201cWe continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the cycling market,\u201d she said. \u201cKeith and his management team have done a fantastic job of building a successful online retail operation and we look forward to working with them to develop and grow the businesses further.\u201d The deal sent Halfords shares up 3%, adding to gains made this year as they continue to recover from the slump triggered by last summer\u2019s sharp drop in cycling-related sales. The Jones brothers started Wheelies as a single bicycle shop in Swansea in the 1980s, moving into mail order and the insurance replacement market during the 1990s. Wheelies is now the UK\u2019s largest provider of replacement bikes for insurance companies.  Tredz, which sells brands such as Giant, Specialized, Cannondale, Cube and Scott, was launched as a separate e-commerce operation in 2005, with the first stores launched in Cardiff and Swansea two years later. Tredz opened the UK\u2019s largest Giant branded store in Swansea in 2014. The group turned over around \u00a332m in the year to 29 February, making a profit before financial charges of \u00a32.4m.   \u201cWe are very proud of the businesses that we\u2019ve grown from a small shop 27 years ago into a strong operator in the premium cycling market, with a team of over 250 people,\u201d said Keith Jones. \u201cWith the support and resources of a large group, we look forward to building upon what we have achieved so far to drive long- term growth.\u201d  Following the sale Michael is leaving the business while Keith will continue as managing director alongside other members of the existing Tredz and Wheelies teams. Halfords said that from a customer and supplier perspective the businesses would continue to trade on a standalone basis. Cannaccord Genuity analyst David Jeary said the acquisition \u201cticks the boxes\u201d for Halfords as it was in the faster-growing online market and brought access to high-end brands. In the past some premium cycling brands have turned their noses up at Halfords, preferring to be sold though specialist independents. Jeary said this could now change: \u201cThere is the potential over time for Halfords to develop closer relationships with some of these brands which have historically not made themselves available.\u201d",
