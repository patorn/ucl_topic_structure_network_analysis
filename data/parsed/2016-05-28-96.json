Around 3,000 refugees were last week transported to the sites after a vast makeshift camp at Idomeni, near Greece\u2019s border with Macedonia, was finally cleared by police.   Related: Idomeni: Greek riot police move in to clear refugee camp    Photographic evidence and the first accounts from volunteers allowed inside some of the military-run accommodation blocks reveal a dire lack of amenities such as running water, and filthy conditions in derelict warehouses that appear unfit for habitation. The closure of Idomeni also means that 4,000 men, women and children remain unaccounted for following the demolition of what was Europe\u2019s largest makeshift refugee camp. The missing refugees, including an undefined number of unaccompanied minors, are thought to be living on the streets of Greek cities such as Thessaloniki, hiding in forests near the Macedonian border or to have been taken by smugglers north into Europe. With the border now shut, refugees heading for Europe are continuing to make the fraught journey from north Africa across the Mediterranean. Two boats capsized in a 24-hour period off the coast of Libya last week. At least five people died, and the Italian navy rescued 562, taking the total transferred to the country this year to around 40,000.

Photograph: Phoebe Ramsay    On Thursday, as the Idomeni camp was officially closed, the Italian coast guard announced it had coordinated 22 separate rescue operations that had saved more than 4,000 lives, making it one of the busiest days of the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Initial reports from inside the Greek camps have prompted calls for action. Images taken inside one new camp, in an industrial zone at Sindos, on the outskirts of Thessaloniki, reveal dirt-strewn warehouses lined with tents pitched on filthy concrete floors \u201cThere was no running water, no medical care, let alone translators, no provisions for infants, no environmental assessment, no evacuation plan,\u201d said Phoebe Ramsay, a volunteer who has been helping refugees in northern Greece since the start of the year.

Volunteer Alexandria South, who visited another camp set up in an old leather factory on the outskirts of Thessaloniki, described atrocious conditions including piles of broken glass, and warehouses with all windows smashed. She said: \u201cThere was no running water or showers or electricity or firewood. Mothers had no hot water for baby formula or to sanitise bottles, and had to use cold water.\u201d She said that conditions deteriorated when the Greek military, who were overseeing the evacuation of Idomeni, ran out of water and began ordering volunteers who were providing food and water for refugees to feed the army first. \u201cThe first day the army was providing limited water bottles for families,\u201d said South. \u201cBut on the second day there was absolutely no water left \u2013 even with new arrivals showing up, some reporting that they were held for three hours without water at the camp.\u201d     A woman sits on stairs inside a new camp for refugees and migrants set in an abandoned factory in Sindos Photograph: Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images    She said there were just six chemical toilets for an estimated 1,000 refugees and that no Wi-Fi had been provided, so it was impossible for people to make asylum claims. Similarly, refugees had not even been told where in Greece they had been relocated. Greece\u2019s migration spokesman, Giorgos Kyritsis, from the governing leftist Syriza party, rejected accusations that the camps lacked basic provisions. \u201cThere is water and electricity everywhere. One of the reasons why we chose ex-industrial buildings instead of open-air camps was for that very reason. \u201cEvery time a new site is opened there are shortages in the beginning but then we add amenities and in due process we resolve them. We\u2019re not saying conditions are perfect, we want to improve them but there is absolutely no comparison between the new facilities and Idomeni. At least now they have a roof over their head. When it rains they don\u2019t get wet and they\u2019re not being forced to live in the mud. Surely that\u2019s an improvement?\u201d He denied that thousands of refugees had gone missing after the Idomeni camp had been closed.   Map of area   Other charities, including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, have reported a number of tearful patients who had been asked to leave Idomeni without clear information on their destination. On Friday the UN urged Greece to rapidly improve \u201csubstandard\u201d conditions in what it described as poorly ventilated derelict warehouses and factories with insufficient food, water and toilets. The International Rescue Committee has also expressed concerns. It called for immediate action to improve standards. Since the route north through the Balkans closed earlier this year, an estimated 54,000 people have been stranded in overcrowded camps in Greece. However, arrivals have fallen significantly since the European Union\u2019s deal with Turkey came into effect two months ago. Additional reporting by Helena Smith",
