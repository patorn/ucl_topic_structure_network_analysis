  "body": "It\u2019s one of the simplest stage directions there is: \u201cthey fight\u201d . That\u2019s all Shakespeare says, usually. There\u2019s no detail on how the characters fight, how long the fight lasts, how violent it is, or anything like that. He gives you a huge amount of latitude. So it\u2019s up to you to find the story. Who fights honourably, who fights dirty, are they brave, are they cowardly, why does one person win? Is it because they\u2019re better or physically stronger, or because they just don\u2019t give up? That\u2019s the real key. I\u2019ve been in this business for the best part of 30 years and I must have choreographed hundreds of Shakespearean fight scenes by now. They\u2019re everywhere: not just in the history plays or the tragedies, but in the comedies too. As You Like It has a wrestling scene, where the young lover Orlando somehow defeats Charles, a professional fighter. In Twelfth Night there\u2019s a fencing match between Sir Andrew Aguecheek and Viola, who\u2019s disguised as a young man. Technically it gets called off at the last minute, and it\u2019s deliberately funny because neither of them wants to fight, but some directors have asked me to choreograph it anyway to set up a bit of argy-bargy.      Try this out for size \u2026 Terry King Photograph: RSC    Perhaps I\u2019m biased, but Shakespeare uses fights as a way of creating excitement. There would have been a real hunger in the audience for them, a bit like the Elizabethan equivalent of action films. You see that in Romeo and Juliet: the whole play is basically a bunch of brawls with some love scenes in the middle to keep up the energy. It\u2019s like a Spielberg movie. It\u2019s popular entertainment. But the history plays are the ones that keep people such as myself really busy. The Henry VI plays are wall-to-wall battles, and even when it\u2019s not a formal battle scene there can be a lot of conflict between rival factions \u2013 they\u2019re full of brawling blokes with lots of strutting and pushing about. They were violent, bloodthirsty times, and Shakespeare\u2019s writing reflects that. The curious thing about Henry V, which was written later, is that although it\u2019s a play about war, and though we spend nearly all the play in the company of soldiers, we only actually see two conflicts: the siege of the French town of Harfleur in act three, and Agincourt in act five. Harfleur happens mainly off stage \u2013 the script calls for trumpet noises and scaling ladders \u2013 and even at Agincourt we see a lot of the run-up to the battle, and then the brutal fall-out, but not much actual fighting.  Ironically, it\u2019s possible to do the play with barely any violence. For the recent RSC production, Gregory Doran, the director, wanted Harfleur to focus on Henry, so we saw him almost alone on stage, and Agincourt was as much about the costs of war as it was about war itself. It was a different challenge to Henry IV Part I, which I also worked on with Greg: the whole movement of the play is towards the fight scene between Hal and Hotspur at the Battle of Shrewsbury right at the end. The battle was going on in the background, a fair bit of smoke and mirrors, and then these two figures just tumbled out. The focus came right down. Alex Hassell\u2019s Hal and Trevor White\u2019s Hotspur were both fighting for their lives, so I worked with them to make it as believable as possible.     Wall to wall battles ... Henry IV Part 1 at the Barbican. Photograph: Kwame Lestrade    Making a battle scene look plausible on stage is a different art. I\u2019ve worked with some pretty big casts \u2013 I did The Lord of the Rings in the West End \u2013 but you never get the number of actors as in film or TV. Like everything else in theatre, it\u2019s how you animate the space, but how you do that is always different: the number of people, the shape of the stage, the kind of weapons they\u2019re using. Dynamic movement is the thing I aim for; you have to keep the actors on the move, and make sure the engagement shifts so you don\u2019t have half a dozen fights breaking out individually, but a mass of people moving around each other. The eternal balance is to make it look disorganised and erratic, but also be absolutely choreographed, so it\u2019s safe. That\u2019s also what helps it look convincing: if actors feel confident they\u2019re not going to get hurt, they\u2019ll put in that extra ounce of effort. How Shakespeare\u2019s company would have done fight scenes is a good question. Men would have carried swords as a matter of course, and been comfortable with using them, or at least threatening to, and people would almost certainly have witnessed more violence on a daily basis. So there was probably more familiarity with fighting among both actors and audiences. At the same time it couldn\u2019t be too dangerous, otherwise people would have got hurt. It must have been the same kind of balance that we try and deal with these days: believability versus safety. That said, I very much doubt they had to fill in a risk-assessment form.",
