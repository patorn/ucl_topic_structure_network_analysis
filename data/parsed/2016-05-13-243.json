Over its 13 tracks, the five-piece explore the nooks and crannies of a distinctly 1970s take of rock\u2019n\u2019roll: it\u2019s an album both rolled and stoned.  For proof, have a look at their new video \u2013 released on Friday morning \u2013 for Butterfly, a song so dripping with Stonesisms, you half expect Keith Richards to rise from one of the graves in the clips.            So how steeped are Twin Peaks \u2013 all in their early 20s \u2013 in the music of the decade of stack heels, feather cuts and roots rock? We cornered Cadien Lake James and Clay Frankel to ask them to name a record they love from each year of the decade. 1970 \u2013 The Stooges: 1970 Cadien Lake James: It\u2019s part of our blood. Clay Frankel: They\u2019re an influence in their mentality about music: bare bones and high energy. On our new record there\u2019s not a lot of Funhouse-type songs, but there is that attitude of cutting loose with your vocals and allowing certain sounds to get blown out. CLJ: The first time I heard the Stooges was when my dad had a restaurant and there was a guy in the back who booked all the music. When I was younger he was a real punk, and he was booking bands like Total Chaos in this little room. I would go into his computer and burn CDs off his iTunes. I remember getting Raw Power \u2013 I was 11 or 12 \u2013 and I loved the Stooges right away. I never really fell in love with the first record, but Funhouse is one of my favourite records from the 70s.            CF: I always knew about them growing up, certain songs of theirs, but this last year I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of Stooges. For its time it\u2019s crazy \u2013 just having a guy screaming tonelessly. He\u2019s just ripping out his larynx. CLJ: I wonder who was listening to it when it came out? Was it just a load of testosterone-filled boys who were, like, \u201cYESSS!\u201d CF: If someone, somewhere, accidentally bought that record knowing nothing about it, and just dropped the needle on it, they must have either loved it or just needed to turn it off.  1971 \u2013 JJ Cale: Crazy Mama CLJ: I just got into this record this year. We were recording in Massachusetts and the guy whose house it was really turned me on to Natural Child, from Nashville. He was showing me shit he thought they were influenced by and JJ Cale was among that. Naturally [recorded in 1971 but not released until 1972] is great. I was getting into back-porch-feeling records. I love how he pulls it all together \u2013 it\u2019s all really understated, that record. Fucking amazing guitar licks, but none of it\u2019s ever in your face. It all sounds like demos that are masterfully crafted. I love the production, and the way the songs wash over you. He was kind of a badass dude: he was living in a trailer for a long time, living off his subsidiaries from Cocaine getting covered.             CF: We\u2019re just starting to dig into forgotten records. Like Link Wray\u2019s 1970 record. CLJ: That record, 3-Track Shack, is Link Wray, his brother and his cousin in a shack at his parents\u2019 farm with a three-track tape machine, and it\u2019s fucking awesome. We should have picked one from there. I try to keep my ears open for stuff I don\u2019t know.  CF: I\u2019m always trying to find new stuff because so much of touring is just sitting in a van. You gotta have something to listen to.  1972 \u2013 The Rolling Stones: Sweet Virginia CLJ: We chose something from Exile on Main Street, because we had to, but we almost chose Magnet by NRBQ, which is probably the most listened to song in the van ever. From Exile, I said Rocks Off, he said Tumbling Dice. And we ended up with this. CF: With that record it\u2019s hard to pick. Sweet Virginia shows you don\u2019t have to be a country guy to make a great fucking country song. Here\u2019s a bunch of city bastards from London who made one of the great country songs.             CLJ: They ended up being the best Americana band of all, and they\u2019re not even from fucking America. The Stones for me is that phase, Beggars through Exile. CF: When I was younger I had no idea they were even British. They sing about America so much. These are great lyrics, but you don\u2019t catch them if you don\u2019t really know them. He\u2019s talking about slipping speed into his shoe and hiding drugs when they\u2019re driving around. Exile is like Funhouse \u2013 they\u2019re both experiences. You have to listen to the whole thing and it leaves you with this pretty good feeling. 1973 \u2013 John Lennon: Aisumasen (I\u2019m Sorry) CF: Mind Games was an album we listened to all the time.  CLJ: I remember going through the post-Beatles solo albums \u2013 I was always a John Lennon guy \u2013 and getting to Mind Games, and it was like, \u201cFuck, this record. It\u2019s IT.\u201d It could be any of the tracks \u2013 Intuition is probably my favourite \u2013 but we picked Aisumasen (I\u2019m Sorry), the ballad. It\u2019s got one of the greatest fucking solos on it, which I always thought was John, but found out recently it wasn\u2019t. Some session guitarist. I also love Pussycats, the Nilsson album that came out right afterwards with the same musicians. We get into it over which version of Many Rivers to Cross is better.            CF: Fucking Jimmy Cliff! CLJ: I say Nilsson all the time. I love his voice. CF: I really don\u2019t like his voice. CLJ: Lennon, Paul and Harrison have all got great solo records. All you need from Harrison is All Things Must Pass, but all Lennon\u2019s records up to the last two are fucking awesome. 1974 \u2013 Neil Young: Walk On            CLJ: Harvest is the classic, but playing with Crazy Horse makes him way more rock\u2019n\u2019roll. CF: I\u2019d heard that song, but we were in Dallas or Houston, and they were having a street fair, and I found On the Beach. CLJ: He was kind of a punk. And he\u2019s still behaving like a punk these days - saying all the streaming stuff is bullshit. Fuck the corporations! Fuck GMOs! I\u2019m Neil Young!    Related: Bowie was to the 70s what the Beatles were to the 60s    1975 \u2013 David Bowie: Young Americans CLJ: If it was just me, I might have had Bowie for every year. I was with Clay, in Washington state, when I found out he\u2019d died. We were real drunk, and I got a text about 3am. Threw my phone against the wall and fell on the ground crying. I was crying at the airport the next day. It was heavy for me. I haven\u2019t really been hit like that when people have died before. CF: He kept it cool to the end. I\u2019m a huge Velvet Underground fan. And when Lou Reed died I went home and listened to a whole lot of Velvet Underground. I certainly didn\u2019t go home and listen to a lot of solo Lou Reed stuff. When a guy dies and the last record he made was with Metallica \u2026 I don\u2019t know.             CLJ: Young Americans is cool because there\u2019s not really one that sounds like that. He has a couple of runs where there are a few records in a row riffing on the same thing. But Young Americans is a cool transition. Diamond Dogs is kinda similar, but it\u2019s more glammy. I love Young Americans because it romanticises America, and that\u2019s a white dude who nailed black music right there. I\u2019d seen that video of him on Soul Train, where he looks like a coked-up freak, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that I was looking on YouTube and found all these videos from around then with him totally alienating himself. You can tell this dude is ON DRUGS. It\u2019s like a paranoid mask and he\u2019s laughing at all this shit and you have no idea what he was laughing at. Just being a freak.  1976 \u2013 The Modern Lovers: Girlfriend CF: I love the Modern Lovers. I love that album cover \u2013 it looks like the sign for a diner. This is one of my favourite records of all time. My dad went to Boston University so he always loved them \u2013 the line on The Modern World where Jonathan Richman sings, \u201cDrop out of BU!\u201d, my dad would be, like, \u201cYeah!\u201d It\u2019s like a friendlier Velvet Underground \u2013 simple songs and bare tones. Roadrunner is one of the greatest opening songs \u2013 just two chords back and forth and really good lyrics. Not \u201cintelligent\u201d, just really well done. Girlfriend I love because it\u2019s got so much character; the way he spells girlfriend wrong, as \u201cgirlfren\u201d. CLJ: He played me that record in the van. I could dig it, but I didn\u2019t love it. But I did get into this one Jonathan Richman record that my dad had \u2013 Modern Lovers Live.            CF: I hate that record! Probably because I love the Modern Lovers so much. I thought when I looked up the rest of the Modern Lovers it would be like that. But he got so cheesy! CLJ: It\u2019s not cheesy. CF: Are you kidding me? It\u2019s all \u201cin the bees in the forest go buzz buzz buzz!\u201d CLJ: That\u2019s not cheesy! It\u2019s weird! CF: If it had been at the time, and I\u2019d been friends with him, saying \u201cJonathan, you can really get on this punk rock wave,\u201d and he\u2019d said, \u201cFuck that. I\u2019m gonna go acoustic,\u201d then I would have been, \u201cDamn, man, you\u2019re badass!\u201d But looking back on it, I love the punky stuff. But they never tried for that again. 1977 \u2013 Dead Boys: Sonic Reducer CF: There was a time, two years ago, when I was listening to Dead Boys a lot. They were one of the few punk bands who were so over the top that it seemed like they had a sense of humour about it, though I don\u2019t know if that was intentional. Just how offensive could they be \u2013 Caught With the Meat in Your Mouth? Sonic Reducer is a great one because it\u2019s really punk. The cool thing about Sonic Reducer is the really psychedelic production. As you can see we\u2019re choosing a lot of hippy music and a lot of punk music \u2018cos we like both, and we\u2019re trying to be a blend of the two.  CLJ: Rocket from the Tombs, the band they busted out of, have this version of Sonic Reducer, and the production on that record is crazy. I got that record because I was down with the Rocket From the Crypt \u2013 I accidentally got that record and saw it had Sonic Reducer on it. \u201cWhat is this? It sounds crazy!\u201d You think Stiv Bators has a nasty voice, but their singer? Pig man!            CF: It\u2019s such a great song to start your first record: \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone! Don\u2019t need no mom and dad! Don\u2019t need no good advice! Don\u2019t need no human life!\u201d Right off the bat, you know what you\u2019re dealing with.  CLJ: There are videos of them playing at CBGB. Everybody\u2019s sitting on the floor, but he\u2019s still spitting shit from his fucking mouth. CF: That\u2019s how they used to do it back in the day. Everybody sat at tables, like they\u2019re just there for a drink. We go to so many shows, and that\u2019s actually how I\u2019d prefer to go to shows this days. If I could just watch the Dead Boys, sit down and not have to do shit, that\u2019d be great. 1978 \u2013 The Band: The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down CLJ: This is a bit of a cheat, but they didn\u2019t release The Last Waltz until 1978. In the past year I\u2019ve got into the Band, and Bob Dylan\u2019s 70s stuff.  CF: It happened to us naturally. If you\u2019re driving around America for two years, six-hour drives every day, it\u2019s almost inevitable to start listening to music that sounds like the landscape. If we had started the band and moved straight to New York and only played there, maybe we wouldn\u2019t be listening to this stuff.             CLJ: When I was younger, I would have called myself fucked for ever liking Bob Dylan. Which might have been silly. My dad was there when they pulled the plug on Dylan at Newport. \u201cIt\u2019s not folk!\u201d No it\u2019s motherfucking rock\u2019n\u2019roll, dude. That\u2019s awesome. CF: I like hearing these stories about what was out of bounds back in the day. Like people blown away that Bob Dylan picked up an electric guitar. To me, there\u2019s no difference between The Times They Are a-Changin\u2019 and electric Dylan. It\u2019s still a guy who keeps to two chords and sings a lot of lyrics. Also, the Band \u2013 I love the cover Dylan painted for their first record. We love childish artwork. And we like songs that are loose. None of these songs are cleaned up. There\u2019s something very human about it. Sloppiness that could be easily avoided, we like to leave in there. If someone fucks up, but not too bad, we like to leave it in. CLJ: The last track on our record is full of people fucking up. 1979 \u2013 The Clash: Train in Vain CF: The first time I heard this was when the skateboarder Rodney Mullen used it for his segment of this skate video, and you couldn\u2019t make a better music video than that. Punk dude doing street skating with Train in Vain playing. It\u2019s a funny song because you can try to play it on guitar, but it\u2019s hard to make it sound full enough. This is when Mick Jones started writing love songs, finally, which is probably what he wanted to do all along, but they had that manager who said: \u201cYou gotta sing about unemployment!\u201d It\u2019s just a great love song, with a punk aesthetic.            CLJ: First time I heard it, we were coming back from a show and you were up there, fake DJing between every song in the car. \u201cUp next. We\u2019ve got this \u2026\u201d I\u2019d just been broken up with, and I was feeling terrible, and the lyrics devastated me: \u201cOh man, this song is it!\u201d CF: I really wish I had written this song. Or maybe not. I like listening to it. And I don\u2019t like listening to my own so much.  \u2022 Down in Heaven by Twin Peaks is out now on Communion.",
