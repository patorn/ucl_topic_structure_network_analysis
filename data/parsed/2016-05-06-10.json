  "body": "Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has been hit with a six-match ban by the Football Association for gouging the eye of Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa while the fallout from Monday\u2019s Battle of Stamford Bridge continued with the Tottenham Hotspur manager, Mauricio Pochettino, accusing Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Eden Hazard of lacking professionalism. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was caught on camera pushing his finger into Costa\u2019s eye and, with the referee, Mark Clattenburg, having missed the flashpoint, the way was cleared for retrospective punishment. The Tottenham midfielder accepted the FA\u2019s charge of violent conduct, which carried a three-game suspension but he contested the governing body\u2019s claim that he ought to be banned for longer.   Related: Mauricio Pochettino praises Tottenham character in Chelsea battle    Tottenham argued that three matches would have been sufficient and it is known they were bemused that Costa, having been poked in the left eye, initially grabbed his right one. The club also cited Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s lack of previous for violent conduct during his six seasons in English football. But the FA\u2019s independent regulatory commission rejected their arguments and ordered that the three extra games were appropriate. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 will miss the final two fixtures of this season \u2013 against Southampton and Newcastle United \u2013 and the first four of the next domestic campaign. Tottenham have no right of appeal. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is known as a mild-mannered character and his only previous brush with authority during his time in England was the harsh red card that he received for his previous club, Fulham, in a Europa League tie at Wisla Krakow in 2011. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 pushed Wisla\u2019s Gervasio N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who went to ground theatrically. The game at Stamford Bridge, however, was no ordinary one and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, like many of the players, was keyed up to the point of combustion. He squared up to Mikel Jon Obi in the early running and he lost his head during the melee at the end of the first half, in which he gouged Costa. Tottenham were 2-0 in front at the time but they would draw 2-2 \u2013 a result that ended their Premier League title hopes and saw Leicester City crowned as champions. There was frustration at Tottenham before the game when the Chelsea players F\u00e0bregas and Hazard said that they hoped Leicester would win the title and there has since been a feeling at White Hart Lane \u2013 although it was not articulated by Pochettino \u2013 that their comments helped to set the volatile tone. It was perhaps not a coincidence that F\u00e0bregas and Hazard would come in for heavy challenges. There have been other figures within the game who said that they would prefer Leicester to finish as the champions, including the Swansea City manager, Francesco Guidolin. He said so on the eve of his club\u2019s game at Leicester on 24 April, in which Swansea slumped to a 4-0 defeat. Pochettino believes that all of them have been unprofessional and he wants the issue to be raised and discussed at the next Premier League meeting. \u201cIn football, our responsibility is to be professional,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWhen you are professional, it\u2019s not to give your personal opinion. It\u2019s always dangerous when something happens like that. Maybe in the last few weeks or months, we know the football people who maybe don\u2019t behave like professionals. Maybe, in the next few meetings of the Premier League, the managers and also the staff, we need to say that, in future, we must be careful with all these comments in public.\u201d Pochettino made the point that he did not want to single out F\u00e0bregas and Hazard. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a general opinion. Sometimes my press conferences are boring because I\u2019m very polite or political. No, I am professional. That\u2019s a big difference. I don\u2019t want to be popular. I want to be professional. It\u2019s easy to say big things against our enemy. \u2018Oh, the people love me, I\u2019m very strong, so I\u2019ll say things like this.\u2019 Come on! We are professional. \u201cThe managers, the league, the players\u2019 association \u2013 they need to say that we must behave professionally. We need to play, be honest and show integrity and be professional always. I like that when our opponent fights and tries to win but, for me, if we want to keep healthy football in the future, and not to be cynical and dishonest, we need to behave in a different way.\u201d",
