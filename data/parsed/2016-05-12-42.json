A day after the Coalition accused Labor of \u201clying\u201d about the economic benefits of its education spending, it stands accused of overstating the economic benefits of its $48bn 10-year program of company tax cuts \u2013 the centrepiece of Turnbull\u2019s budget and its election campaign. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told Guardian Australia on Thursday the tax cuts would \u201cwould increase the economy by more than 1% over the medium term or long term so that is 10 or 20 years \u2026 it will help increase the size of the economy by more than 1% over a 20 year period.\u201d   Related: Campaign catchup: Shorten celebrates a birthday and the PM downs a beer    That figure is based on a Treasury paper, released on budget night, but John Daley, the chief executive of the Grattan Institute, said the real economic impact suggested by the paper was \u201c0.6% ... at most\u201d over 20 years or more. The government was referring to the increase in gross domestic product \u2013 the total output of the economy \u2013 found by the Treasury modelling to be 1% under the most realistic scenario considered. But Daley said the Grattan Institute the measure of gross national income (GNI) was more relevant because it excluded the benefits the tax cuts would provide for foreign companies flowing overseas. And the increase in GNI, according to the realistic scenario in the modelling, was 0.6% and, in the short term, Daley said, the economic effect could be negative. \u201cWhen foreign corporations pay less tax, that flows straight out of the economy from day one, although it might be gradually offset by additional investment over time,\u201d he said. The modelling looked at different scenarios by which governments could restore the income lost by the company tax cuts but, according to Daley, \u201c0.6% is the highest it could possibly be\u201d and it would take 25 years for the economy to feel the full benefit.  The assessment of the growth benefits of the tax plan came as Cormann accused the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, of \u201clying\u201d about the benefits of his proposed $37.4bn school funding plan, which he said would boost the economy immediately by 2.8% if implemented. \u201cThere will be a 2.8% \u00adimprovement straight away if we implement these changes and, over the longer term, 11%\u00ad improvement to our GDP,\u201d Shorten said.   Related: Australian election 2016: Malcolm Turnbull grilled on family tax benefit cuts    Shorten was citing a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development from 2015 \u2013 Universal Basic Skills \u2013 which estimated the economic gains to Australia if every child was attending secondary school and had acquired basic skills by 2030. But the report shows the value of future improvements in the economy from a real boost in educational outcomes to be worth 2.8% of GDP, in today\u2019s dollars, by 2095. It also estimates the economy would be 11% larger in 2095 as a consequence. Shorten suggested the benefit could happen straight away. On Thursday Shorten said the OECD had been observing that \u201cif every adult in the workforce now had received the sort of quality education which we are outlining will be our promise in the future, we would have a lift in economic performance right now\u201d and said no one could suggest that improved funding would not improve education outcomes.  Asked about the economic benefits of his package this week, Turnbull said: \u201cIt is well understood and well accepted that if you reduce the level of business taxes, company taxes, then you will get a better return on investment, you will see more investment and you will see more employment and that is the inevitable consequence of it.\u201d",
