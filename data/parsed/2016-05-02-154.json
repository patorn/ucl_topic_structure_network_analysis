  "body": "Marc Albrighton has hailed the never-say-die attitude that has taken Leicester City to the verge of the Premier League title and left Tottenham Hotspur with no margin for error when they face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Monday night. Leicester\u2019s point at Manchester United extended their unbeaten run to 10 matches and means that Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side will be crowned champions if Spurs fail to beat Chelsea. The Leicester players are planning to watch the Spurs match together and Albrighton hopes that the draw secured at Old Trafford, courtesy of Wes Morgan\u2019s first-half equaliser, turns up the heat on Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side, who also have history against them. Spurs have not beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in 28 attempts, going to back to February 1990, when Gary Lineker, of all people, scored a late winner in a 2-1 victory.

They\u2019ve got a tough game away at Chelsea and we\u2019ll be watching that with a close eye on it. I don\u2019t think we can ignore this one. I didn\u2019t watch last week, but I think when there is a chance to win the league, like this week, we have all got to watch it. I think we will probably spend the night all together.\u201d           Leicester City\u2019s Claudio Ranieri: I\u2019ll be last to know if Spurs lose    Albrighton made a conscious decision to avoid Tottenham\u2019s game against West Bromwich Albion a week earlier, when Craig Dawson scored at both ends as the title race took another twist. \u201cI was in a restaurant in Lichfield with my fiancee, oblivious to it,\u201d the former England Under-21 international said. \u201cThe week before when they played Stoke, I watched that. I saw them roll Stoke over and that was pretty hard to take. So last Monday I said we\u2019d go out for a nice meal, and I left my phone in the car. I got back and saw the result and was delighted.\u201d Although Leicester missed out on the chance to wrap up the title at Old Trafford, there was much to be admired about the way they recovered from conceding an early goal, at a time when United were building up a head of steam, hauled themselves back into the game through Morgan\u2019s header and showed resilience and spirit to hold on for a point. \u201cWe\u2019ve got that never-say-die attitude. I think that\u2019s won us a lot of points this season,\u201d Albrighton said. \u201cEarly on this season you\u2019ve got the draws at Stoke and Southampton, we were 2-0 down in both of them, and 2-0 down in the home game against Villa [when Leicester came back to win 3-2]. So that showed our character early in the season and we\u2019ve continued to do that. We\u2019ve gone behind at Old Trafford, which is a daunting place - it\u2019s a big pitch and the fans are behind them, but credit to the lads, we carried on going, got the equaliser and held on.\u201d The one sour note for Leicester was Danny Drinkwater\u2019s second-half dismissal, which rules him out of Saturday\u2019s home match against Everton. \u201cIt is obviously going to be a massive loss for us,\u201d Albrighton said. \u201cDrinky is a great player, he\u2019s been brilliant for us this season and he\u2019ll be gutted that he won\u2019t be able to get involved on Saturday. But I am sure whoever steps in \u2013 whether it is Andy King or one of the other lads \u2013 will do a fantastic job.\u201d",
