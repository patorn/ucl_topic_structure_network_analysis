  "body": "There was supposed to be a Leveson Mark Two \u2013 an inquiry looking more forensically at police and press relations. But David Cameron isn\u2019t keen and nor, for that matter, is Fleet Street anxious to rake over the events of 10 or 12 years ago. We\u2019ve seen exhaustive inquiries, prosecutions, verdicts of guilt or innocence. It\u2019s mostly over for everyone but the Bun. Even Hacked Off may grow weary soon. Except that now concerns over police-press relationships are rather different. Think Hillsborough, and start again. Peter Oborne\u2019s verdict in the Mail was the same as that of the inquest jury. \u201cWe are not talking here about a few bad apples. The South Yorkshire police lied, and lied and lied again.\u201d David Conn in the Guardian called it the \u201crelentlessly detailed evisceration of a British police force\u201d. And such squalor doesn\u2019t stand alone. Oborne links it to impunity after Orgreave and the miners\u2019 strike. False witness brushed aside in the Thatcher era. Labour would lob the Shrewsbury 24 into the same pot, plus the stinking south London failure to track down the killers of Daniel Morgan (investigator of police corruption). But in fact the charge sheet stretches on and on, from Stephen Lawrence to Jean Charles de Menezes: deaths, botches, dissemblings. And as for the phone-hacking years, remember the Yard\u2019s initial lack of interest and perfunctory inquiries into what had gone wrong - a compare and contrast study in the millions they spent afterwards once \u2018perfunctory\u2019 didn\u2019t fit the bill. Of course newspapers have a lot to answer for. The Sun has been tarred and feathered for its first version of Hillsborough \u201cjustice\u201d. But though it, in its ancestral way, made an addled five-egg omelette of South Yorkshire police\u2019s lies (and, like the Times, didn\u2019t get reporting the inquest verdict right), that doesn\u2019t excuse the lies. Rather, it sheds a bleak, grey light on much of the coverage of 27 years ago. Can journalists reporting in print or on screen about tragic events expect truth from our police, or back-covering mendacity? Is there any consistent hope of straight dealing here? Police inquiries will always stumble from time to time. That\u2019s in the nature of the job. But acknowledging the stumble is part of the job \u2013 from Hillsborough to Operation Midland. Elizabeth Filkin was fastest off the mark after phone hacking, with a report that sought to sanitise police behaviour by cutting off all but formal media contacts. That looked like a mistake then and looks like one now. Hillsborough, and an initially complaisant press, saw South Yorkshire police in its own cocoon of lies. Filkin custom weaves more cocoons \u2013 believing that press contagion infects the police. Construct a cordon sanitaire of silence around the boys in blue. But what if, often, that\u2019s the wrong way around? What if whistleblowers are blown away or, worse, in prison? What if separation makes things worse? If Leveson 2 could centre on victims of injustice and what Andy Burnham calls their \u201cfight for truth\u201d, that might be reason to reconvene and see what a constantly moving finger writes. But, at the very least, in a very tight spot, we need Filkin 2.",
