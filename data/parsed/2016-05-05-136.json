  "body": "With less than a week until the Brazilian senate votes on the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, the question facing the nation is no longer whether the Workers\u2019 party government will fall, but how far to the right the political pendulum will swing once it has fallen. For Marco Feliciano \u2013 an ultra-conservative preacher-politician from the evangelical caucus \u2013 it cannot go far enough in reversing what he sees as the malign policies introduced since the left came to power in 2003. \u201cFor 13 years we have been anaesthetised. Now we will see the renaissance of hope in Brazil,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t just want the Workers\u2019 party to go, I want it to disappear from history, to fall into extinction.\u201d   Related: Brazil's 'bullets, beef and bible' caucus wants to imprison 16-year-olds    Speaking in his parliamentary office in Bras\u00edlia, the controversial Social Christian congressman said impeachment opens the door for a resurgent right \u2013 an alarming prospect for anyone on the left or in the centre who is worried about the polarisation of Brazilian politics. His comments reflect the growing influence of the \u201cbullets, beef and Bible\u201d (BBB) caucus, which aims to strengthen the military, expand agriculture and tighten restrictions on abortion, gay marriage and secular education.  There is still a long way to go before that happens. In the short term, Vice-President Michel Temer is expected to form a centre-right administration for the 180 days of the senate\u2019s deliberations on Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. But longer term, conservatives like Feliciano feel they are well placed to expand their influence.  They are already on the rise. Three years ago, Feliciano was on the defensive after his appointment as head of the lower house human rights committee was challenged by civil rights groups. They used old videos of sermons in which he called Aids a \u201cgay plague\u201d and claimed John Lennon deserved to die because he had compared the Beatles to Jesus Christ. Today, however, he is triumphantly on the offensive. His most powerful political enemy, Rousseff, has been at least temporarily neutered. And while he is reviled by the left, he is adored by the right, which now dominates social networks.     Marco Feliciano: \u2018I don\u2019t just want the Workers\u2019 party to go, I want it to disappear from history.\u2019 Photograph: Nelson Antoine/AP    \u201cI\u2019m now the second most \u2018liked\u2019 politician in Brazil,\u201d Feliciano says as he opens up a laptop to display a social network ranking that puts him \u2013 with more than 3.5m likes \u2013 well ahead of the soon-to-be-removed president. Close behind, he pointed out, was his controversial party colleague, Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain and apologist for the 1964-1985 military dictatorship who caused a storm during the lower house impeachment debate by dedicating his vote to a notorious torturer of political prisoners from the 1970s, Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra. Those comments caused outrage around the world, but added an extra half million \u201clikes\u201d to Bolsonaro\u2019s Facebook page in just two weeks.  After joining forces in March, the two appear to have made a Blair-Brown type deal about who should run first for high office. \u201cBolsonaro will be our candidate for president in 2018,\u201d Feliciano said during the interview in his parliamentary office. \u201cI will run for the senate next time and the presidency later.\u201d  The BBB caucus \u2013 in some ways a radical Brazilian version of the Tea Party \u2013 has already expanded its presence in Congress, in the courts, in the streets and \u2013 with increasing importance \u2013 online. The question is how far it can go.  The highest point so far was last month\u2019s lower house impeachment vote, which was instigated and overseen by the evangelical house speaker, Eduardo Cunha, who is accused of corruption, perjury and money laundering. The supreme court suspended Cunha on Thursday for obstructing justice, but Feliciano has lauded his role. In comments to the Brazilian media, Feliciano compared Cunha to the villain in the film Despicable Me, declaring: \u201cIf he is evil, then he is my favourite type of evil because he got impeachment moving.\u201d The strength of the conservative lobby was evident during the vote, when deputy after deputy dedicated their ballots to God, family or country. Almost none actually mentioned Rousseff\u2019s alleged fiscal irregularities \u2013 the issue they were supposed to be judging.   Related: Dilma Rousseff taunt opens old wounds of dictatorship era's torture in Brazil    This highlighted a religious as well as political shift. Many Catholic groups said they were alarmed that God\u2019s name was taken in vain. The Brazilian Bishops\u2019 Justice and Peace Commission told the Catholic News Service they felt \u201can overwhelming feeling of embarrassment and dissatisfaction\u201d. But the US-influenced evangelicals are now such a strong lobby that even Vice-President Temer \u2013 a Catholic who is expected to replace Rousseff within weeks \u2013 had to pay homage. In the midst of hectic negotiations about who should be in his new cabinet on Wednesday, Temer made time to pray with Silas Malafaia, the head of the God\u2019s Victory in Christ Assembly. Asked if impeachment had created new opportunities for the evangelical bloc, Feliciano beamed: \u201cVery much so,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2010, we had 60 seats. Now 95. We elected Cunha as the speaker of the house. We\u2019re growing.\u201d In March, Feliciano\u2019s Social Christian party was joined by Bolsonaro. It was in many ways a political marriage between the most radical evangelical and the most controversial militarist, who together hope to conceive a new generation of ultra-right governments. Bolsonaro brings backing from a wealthy Catholic elite to Feliciano\u2019s grassroots campaign network of evangelical churches.

According to the latest Ibope opinion survey, the former military man has the support of 11% of voters, which means close to 15 million people endorse a supporter of dictatorship.  That\u2019s a long way from the 54 million votes that Rousseff needed to clinch the last election, but enough to prompt debate about the consequences of a shrinking middle ground. Jean Wyllys, a leftwing deputy with the Socialism and Liberty party, said he feared \u201cfascism could re-emerge in the form of Bolsonaro\u201d at the next election in 2018. Wyllys, a professor who was the first congressman to be elected on an LGBT rights platform, has arguably been the fiercest opponent of the extreme right and could one day be their challenger in a presidential race. During the impeachment vote, he engaged in a spitting battle with Bolsonaro and his supporters. Mainstream leaders say radicals are out of step with Brazil. \u201cThere is polarisation in politics, but not in society,\u201d former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, told the Guardian. \u201cThe evangelicals are having a more consistent role in congress, and are acting in a prejudiced manner,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter this political crisis, there needs to be an effort towards political unification. We need to end this idea of good and evil.\u201d Carlos Pereira, a political scientist at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, said the country\u2019s democracy was sufficiently stable to resist radicals. \u201cAs in many European countries, extremists, like Bolsonaro and Feliciano, have a niche in proportional representation systems. Nevertheless, they are not viable candidates in any contest that requires them to secure a majority, such as a campaign for mayor, governor or president,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not credible contenders for executive positions.\u201d  Others, however, say political instability and the ongoing Lava Jato corruption investigation could so badly erode mainstream politics that outsiders could rise to power. Rafael Cortez, a political analyst at S\u00e3o Paulo-based consulting firm Tend\u00eancias, said this created a risk that Brazil might see as figure emerge like Silvio Berlusconi in Italy after the \u201cClean Hands\u201d anti-corruption operation. Overall, however, he was optimistic that moderate voices would prevail in the democratic system despite the polarisation of recent years.

Photograph: Miguel Schincariol/AFP/Getty Images    More confident still was David Fleischer, a political scientist at the University of Bras\u00edlia, who said the result of impeachment was more likely to be a shift to the middle. Rousseff, he said, had failed because she ignored centrist allies. He pointed out that there was now a move to expel Bolsonaro from the house of deputies because he went too far in his praise of Ustra. Certainly, there are limits to the rise of the right. Even if the 22% of the population who consider themselves evangelical all voted as a bloc \u2013 which is unlikely given the differences between churches \u2013 that would mean only 44m votes, which is not enough to take power. But Feliciano predicts his party will grow in influence and soon be represented in government \u2013 if not in the next cabinet, then the one after. He is also reaching out to a wider audience by moderating his tone when needed.  He told the Guardian he had been demonised by his enemies and misunderstood by the public.  \u201cI\u2019m not homophobic. I have friends who are gay. There are people who frequent my house who are gay,\u201d he says. But pressed on what this means in terms of policy, he says he is opposed to any moves to legalise gay marriage. But there is atonement on the subject of John Lennon. Feliciano admits he was wrong to call the three bullets that killed the singer \u201cthe Father, Son and Holy Ghost\u201d but says it was a mistake made more than 2o years ago that he has long since changed his views about. \u201cWhen I was a child, I thought as a child,\u201d he says, quoting scripture. \u201cNow I realise Lennon is a genius and a poet. I can sing Lennon.\u201d  And with that he croons the opening of Imagine.",
