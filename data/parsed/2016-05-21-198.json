Any awkward moments?Plenty. I asked Charlie if I could go to the toilet. Good table manners?Impeccable. Best thing about Charlie?She\u2019s open-minded and a great listener. Would you introduce her to your friends? Yes. Describe her in three wordsFunny, awkward, attractive. What do you think she made of you?That I was pretty easy-going and easy on the eye. Did you go on somewhere?No, it was quite late by the time we left the restaurant and Charlie had to prepare for a wedding she was travelling to the next day. And\u2026 did you kiss?No comment. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I wouldn\u2019t have arrived 15 minutes early. That got me nervous. Marks out of 10?9. Would you meet again?Yes.
