  "body": "How much can change between catchups: today\u2019s campaigning has been derailed by questions over last night\u2019s raid of Labor MP Stephen Conroy\u2019s office, as well as the home of at least one staffer, by Australian federal police. The decision to investigate the opposition during an election campaign has sparked a political storm, with how much the government knew of the AFP\u2019s activities \u2013 if anything \u2013 a particular sticking point. The AFP is now examining and analysing material collected in the raids.  Ministers, notably Christopher Pyne and Mathias Cormann, say the AFP is its own organisation, independent of government; the AFP says the investigation had been under way since 9 December and that it made decisions about the raid alone. But Labor has resisted bids to dismiss the raids as police business as usual. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said it \u201cbeggars belief that a government agency, the NBN, has completely, without reference to its minister, completely without reference to the PM or any of their staff, gone about pursuing the leaks in the way that it has\u201d.  Malcolm Turnbull accused Labor of \u201cseeking to attack the integrity\u201d of the AFP, and said they \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves\u201d.           Shorten on federal police raids: \u2018It\u2019s an extraordinary development\u2019     It\u2019s understood the raid is in relation to a leak about the National Broadband Network. Fairfax Media reported that its own coverage of the NBN rollout, showing it was over-budget and behind schedule, was a factor.  \u201cThis is serious stuff,\u201d writes deputy political editor, Katharine Murphy, in the Guardian Australia blog. \u201cI can\u2019t remember any such high-octane action being taken during the last 20 years I\u2019ve been a political reporter.\u201d So near and yet Sufi Sherry Sufi, the Liberal candidate for Fremantle and Sherlock Holmes hobbyist, has announced his resignation from both the candidacy and his post as head of the state party\u2019s policy committee. He said he made the decision \u201cin light of continued focus on events from my history\u201d, and apologised if his words and actions had caused offence: \u201cThis was never my intent.\u201d    Well, Sherry Sufi's resignation means that what I received yesterday is not true, already! #ausvotes #wapol pic.twitter.com/99rKDlV5pX\u2014 Substandard and Poor (@64AnthonyP) May 20, 2016    His statement wasn\u2019t explicit, but one assumes the old \u201capology-if\u201d alludes to the recent discoveries that Sufi a) incorrectly described his employment history on his application for endorsement, and published writing online that indicated b) he is against constitutional recognition for Indigenous Australians and c) thinks marriage equality might lead to polygamy. Though it went to press before his resignation, Saturday\u2019s edition of the Fremantle Herald also claims d) that Sufi was reportedly filmed impersonating a former employer\u2019s South African accent in such graphic language to warrant a front-page warning for Herald readers.    The @FremantleHerald has the details of the Sherry Sufi video of him mocking his boss's accent #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/bfzTew0jr8\u2014 Rob Harris (@rharris334) May 20, 2016    On the plus side, Sufi will have more time to contribute to the Sherlock Holmes Society of WA. Turnbull mixes growth with dead cats  Turnbull took in wine, honey and corrosive fluids in his tour of the best produce and manufacturing Tasmania has to offer today. Don\u2019t get those mixed up, PM! After a particularly animated speech about jobs and growth (there was fist-pumping, Katharine Murphy reports), the prime minister was visibly irritated when reporters wanted to talk about Thursday night\u2019s AFP raid and \u2013 still \u2013 Peter Dutton\u2019s comments about refugees. Don\u2019t they know that was two days ago?    The PM was asked if he or his staff had ever leaked a confidential document at a press conference in Tasmania pic.twitter.com/X1NGZNoirx\u2014 andrew meares (@mearesy) May 20, 2016    Of course Turnbull invited (figuratively \u2013 definitely not literally) the latter line of questioning by speaking at a winery owned by Josef Chromy, whose escape from a war-torn Czech village in 1950 figures significantly in his success story.

Yet the prime minister hasn\u2019t exactly buried his minister\u2019s message, instead repeating it with (albeit pivotal) tweaks. As Guardian Australia deputy editor Will Woodward writes, this is nothing we haven\u2019t seen before \u2013 in fact it\u2019s straight from the playbook of Crosby Textor, the Australian strategists who make a habit of winning elections.  \u201cThis sneaky, back-of-the-hand play to the base\u2019s worst instincts does Turnbull\u2019s campaign little credit. The strategy is exportable. It may be effective. It\u2019s not edifying.\u201d  At least one person has voiced disagreement with Woodward over his \u201c#feelpinion\u201d.
