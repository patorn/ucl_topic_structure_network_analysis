Along with the outgoing mayor, Boris Johnson, the prime minister rallied supporters at Grey Court school in Goldsmith\u2019s Richmond constituency as the latest poll put Khan nine points ahead of Goldsmith. YouGov had the Labour candidate 16 points ahead last month.  As Khan distanced himself from Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, telling the leadership to \u201cget a grip\u201d on antisemitism following the row that led to the suspension of Ken Livingstone and Naz Shah MP last week, Cameron and Johnson both sought to paint Khan as Corbyn\u2019s man. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know everything about Labour\u2019s candidate, you just need to know one fact,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cHe nominated Jeremy Corbyn to be leader of the Labour party and doesn\u2019t regret that choice. If you want to be lab rats in Labour\u2019s experiment with London then you go for the other guy.\u201d     The Labour candidate for London mayor, Sadiq Khan, speaks to supporters at the Royal Festival Hall. Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images    Turnout in Thursday\u2019s poll is predicted to be as low as 32%, according to Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics, who said this could favour Goldsmith. Goldsmith was planning to campaign through the night into Wednesday, visiting night workers in pubs, food markets, a supermarket delivery hub and railway depot and going out on a 4.30am milk round.  \u201cI am hoping to do a bit of a Leicester City \u2013 zoom in from behind and win,\u201d Goldsmith said. He told a packed school hall of supporters, including his mother, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, and donors: \u201cI am going to need you to throw the kitchen sink at this campaign [in the final days].\u201d Johnson said: \u201cThe Labour party is in my view currently imploding. We have a fantastic chance on Thursday.\u201d  Khan earlier attacked Corbyn saying he was \u201cdisappointed the leadership didn\u2019t act swiftly and decisively\u201d over antisemitism and telling the Evening Standard he was \u201cso unhappy because the impression has been given that they don\u2019t understand how appalling antisemitism is \u2013 that there\u2019s a hierarchy when it comes to racism\u201d.

Khan used his final speech of the campaign to urge voters \u201cto choose hope over fear\u201d and said he would be \u201ca mayor for all Londoners\u201d. Attempting to turn voters\u2019 focus towards the housing crisis he told the audience at the Southbank Centre: \u201cThe Tories and Zac Goldsmith do not want to build more genuinely affordable homes. You only need to look at the housing bill \u2013 which I will be voting against in parliament tonight. It will mean the forced sell-off of affordable family-sized homes in London.\u201d Khan claimed Londoners will need an annual income of \u00a377,000 to afford a starter home; that rents will increase by more than \u00a3100 a week to over \u00a32,000 a month on average; that rough sleeping will increase by more than half; and that the average cost of a home for first-time buyers will increase to nearly \u00a3500,000.  But Goldsmith continued his assault on Khan\u2019s alleged links with extremists, saying he stood by every word of his article in the Mail on Sunday which was illustrated with a picture of the double decker bus that was blown up on Tavistock Square on 7/7 under the headline: \u201cOn Thursday are we really going to hand the world\u2019s greatest city to a Labour party that thinks terrorists are its friends.\u201d  Khan\u2019s team said it was \u201ca new low\u201d and while Goldsmith admitted the image was \u201cinappropriate\u201d, he said: \u201cThe words in the article are absolutely right. The Labour party, including Sadiq Khan, including Jeremy Corbyn, have given legitimacy over and over again to people who hold extreme views \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt.\u201d  Goldsmith had written that Labour \u201crepeatedly legitimised those with extremist views\u201d and said it would be wrong to hand the party control of the Met and national counter-terrorism policy.  He said a Khan win would be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d and tried to draw the Labour candidate into last week\u2019s antisemitism row about Livingstone claiming he backed the former London mayor over his suspension in 2006 for antisemitic remarks to a Jewish reporter.",
