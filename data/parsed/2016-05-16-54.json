  "body": "So Mi Dar is lame and has been ruled out of the Oaks by her trainer, John Gosden. The unbeaten filly, who was such an impressive winner of the Musidora Stakes at York last week, had been a general 5-2 second-favourite for the Epsom race on 3 June, which now appears at the mercy of Minding.   Related: Minding\u2019s 1,000 Guineas superiority prompts talk of gatecrashing Derby    Gosden said the injury was probably caused in the Musidora and has taken time to reveal itself. He noticed So Mi Dar was favouring one of her hind legs while she was trotting on Monday morning. \u201cCame out of the race great, ate up, perfectly happy this morning,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cWe walked for 10, 15 minutes, nice little trot, just to see how they are \u2026 She was lame, left hind. \u201cWe would call it a one to two out of five, if you grade it on lameness. It\u2019s the old story, she may well come right in 10 days but at this stage you cannot get to any major race if you walk for 10 days. \u201cThe horse comes very much first. Luckily, I\u2019m training for proper owner-breeders who understand the game and understand horses and took it well and said: \u2019Do what is right for the filly.\u2019\u201d Gosden added that So Mi Dar would \u201cprobably\u201d be fit in time to take part in the Irish Oaks on 16 July. \u201cIt\u2019s a real disappointment. She\u2019s a gorgeous filly and she won in great style and we were all thrilled. I\u2019m sure she will probably be back for the Irish Oaks but sadly not Epsom. Such is life, but always look after the horse. Anyhow, as I came here, I went by to see her and she had her nose in the feed-bowl, munching away very happy.\u201d Minding, Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s brilliant winner of the 1,000 Guineas, is now a best price of 4-6 to follow up in the Oaks, having been 11-10 before the news broke. O\u2019Brien also has the second favourite in Ballydoyle and everything else is 12-1 or bigger. Gosden still has high hopes of Classic success on the day after the Oaks, when he will saddle Wings Of Desire in the Derby. The colt is currently 5-1 second-favourite.",
