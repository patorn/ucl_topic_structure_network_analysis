  "body": "The centenary of the Arab revolt against the Turks has spurred a revival of interest in TE Lawrence. Terence Rattigan\u2019s Ross is shortly to be revived at Chichester, and Hampstead gets in first with a new play by Howard Brenton that asks why Lawrence, who did so much to inspire the Arab uprising, sought anonymity in 1922 by enlisting, under an assumed name, as a low-grade aircraftman. Brenton\u2019s answers are entirely plausible without being revelatory.  Brenton sets his play in the Hertfordshire home of George Bernard Shaw and his wife, Charlotte, where Lawrence is a regular visitor and where he relives the desert campaign in his mind.  Brenton follows Shaw\u2019s biographer, Michael Holroyd, in suggesting that Lawrence\u2019s presence fed into the dramatist\u2019s portrait of Saint Joan and aroused a deep passion in the sexually neglected Charlotte. Brenton also writes with great conviction about the British government\u2019s bad faith in secretly arranging, under the Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916, for a postwar Franco-British carve-up of the Middle East. Political map-making, as Brenton demonstrated in Drawing the Line, his play about the partition of India, can have disastrous consequences.     Convincing \u2026 Geraldine James as Charlotte and Jeff Rawle as George Bernard Shaw. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian     But Brenton\u2019s idea that Lawrence was haunted by guilt is hardly new. As early as 1935, Winston Churchill suggested that Lawrence\u2019s renunciation of worldly power sprang from an injured spirit. Churchill did, however, write of \u201cthe charm and gaiety of his companionship\u201d, and not enough of that emerges in Brenton\u2019s version. Jack Laskey plays Lawrence extremely well as a tortured figure, conscious of his complicity in British betrayal and masochistically seeking punishment, without having much chance to explain why he was such a welcome house guest. Geraldine James clearly establishes Charlotte\u2019s compassion, Jeff Rawle is totally convincing as her play-preoccupied husband and William Chubb briskly conveys the poker-backed pragmatism of Field Marshal Allenby.  John Dove\u2019s production is also a model of clarity and achieves the transitions from the village of Ayot St Lawrence to Arabia with great ease. But while I enjoyed Brenton\u2019s attempt to unravel the mystery of TE Lawrence, I can\u2019t say I was shocked into startling new awareness.  At Hampstead theatre, London, until 4 June.
