  "body": "The deputy head of the Israeli military has been forced to backtrack after appearing to compare some attitudes in present-day Israel to \u201cnauseating trends\u201d in 1930s Germany. In a hard-hitting Holocaust memorial day speech on Wednesday evening, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) deputy chief of staff, Maj Gen Yair Golan, made remarks that he felt compelled to clarify overnight on Thursday, insisting he had not \u201cintended to compare Israel to Nazi Germany\u201d. Both the timing \u2013 on the day that marks the murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazis \u2013 and the perceived comparison, touch on the most sensitive of issues in Israel.  Golan told an audience including a government minister and survivors of the Holocaust: \u201cThe Holocaust must lead us to think about our public lives, and even more than that, it must guide anyone who has the ability, not only those who wish to bear public responsibility. \u201cBecause if there is anything that frightens me in the remembrance of the Holocaust, it is discerning nauseating trends that took place in Europe in general, and in Germany specifically back then, 70, 80 and 90 years ago, and seeing evidence of them here among us in the year 2016.  \u201cAfter all, there is nothing simpler and easier than hating the foreigner, there is nothing easier and simpler than arousing fears and intimidating, there is nothing easier and simpler than becoming bestial, forgoing principles and becoming smug.\u201d His remarks immediately provoked outrage on Twitter, particularly for referring to the case of an Israeli soldier who shot dead a wounded Palestinian attacker in Hebron after he had ceased to pose a threat. Among Golan\u2019s critics was Israel\u2019s far-right education minister, Naftali Bennett, who was in the audience. \u201cA moment before our soldiers are compared to Nazis, with \u2018endorsement\u2019 from up high \u2013 the deputy chief of staff has erred and must rectify it immediately,\u201d Bennett said on Twitter. Israel\u2019s opposition leader Isaac Herzog, however, praised Golan as a \u201ccourageous commander\u201d adding: \u201cThe crazies who will now start screaming against him should know: this is what morality and responsibility sound like.\u201d  In a statement on Thursday morning, however, Golan insisted: \u201cIt is an absurd and baseless comparison and I had no intention whatsoever to draw any sort of parallel or to criticise the national leadership. The IDF is a moral army that respects the rules of engagement and protects human dignity.\u201d Golan\u2019s point in his address appeared to be that \u2013 like the Israeli religious holiday of Yom Kippur, the day of atonement \u2013 Holocaust memorial day should be an opportunity for atonement and reflection. \u201cOn Holocaust remembrance day, it is worthwhile to ponder our capacity to uproot the first signs of intolerance, violence, and self-destruction that arise on the path to moral degradation,\u201d Golan said. Apparently referring to the case of Sgt Elor Azaria, and the support for the soldier including among Israeli ministers, he said: \u201cImproper use of weapons and violating the sanctity of arms have taken place since the IDF\u2019s founding.  \u201cThe IDF should be proud that throughout its history it has had the ability to investigate severe incidents without hesitation. It should be proud that it has probed problematic behaviour with courage and that it has taken responsibility not just for the good, but also for the bad and the inappropriate. \u201cWe didn\u2019t try to justify ourselves, we didn\u2019t cover anything up, we didn\u2019t whitewash, we didn\u2019t make excuses, and we didn\u2019t equivocate. Our path was \u2013 and will be \u2013 one of truth and shouldering responsibility, even if the truth is difficult and the burden of responsibility is a heavy one.\u201d Despite the release of a statement by the Israeli military insisting Golan was not comparing Israel with Germany in the 1930s, his remarks drew wide attention from columnists in Israel\u2019s morning papers. Yossi Yehoshua, in Yedioth Ahoronoth, described the speech as problematic, writing: \u201cThe comparison to the Holocaust, at the time and place it was made, will only serve to make him the object of criticism and will dull the message that he wanted to convey.\u201d Yoaz Hendel, in the same paper, was even more forthright: \u201cThe Holocaust is different because it involved a racial doctrine, a hatred of the other, popular support and an extermination mechanism that was directed against a minority that did everything in its power to integrate into society. It was absolute evil. \u201cThere is no similarity between what happened then and trends on the fringes of Israeli society \u2013 no matter how fraught our debates here about warfare morality or the state of discourse in the social networks become.\u201d",
