  "body": "A Melbourne man who described Australia as an \u201copen-air prison\u201d after authorities revoked his passport is among five men arrested in far-north Queensland on suspicions they planned to sail to Indonesia en route to Syria. The four others arrested with Kadir Kaya, including Musa Cerantonio, Shayden Thorne and two unnamed men, were allegedly known to security agencies and had also had their passports revoked. The group was arrested on Tuesday evening north of Cairns after towing a seven-metre boat on a minimum 31-hour drive from Melbourne.

Eight search warrants were executed in Melbourne on Wednesday in connection with the alleged plot. The deputy commissioner of the Victoria police, Shane Patton, told reporters on Wednesday the seriousness of the allegations should not be downplayed. \u201cI want to be perfectly clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a serious attempt by five men who are of security interest to us, who have had their passports cancelled. \u201cUltimately we\u2019re investigating the intention to possibly end up in Syria to fight.\u201d Alex Jones, a solicitor acting for Thorne, said on Wednesday he was not aware of any charges laid against his client.",
