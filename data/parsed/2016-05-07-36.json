  "body": "In December 2012, when the news broke that classrooms full of first-graders had been shot to death at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut, Julianne Moore was on a movie set in Queens.    Related: Sandy Hook victims\u2019 families get access to gun manufacturer marketing records    She turned off the TV in her trailer and asked the crew not to talk about the shooting. Her 10-year-old daughter was with her, and she wanted to shield her from the news.  The same day, Melissa Joan Hart was at home in Connecticut with her family. One of her sons was also a first-grader, at a different public school in the state.  \u201cThe first thing I thought,\u201d she said on Saturday, \u201cwas, \u2018This couldn\u2019t really be happening in Connecticut.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think it could be anything really serious in Connecticut.\u201d The news \u201cshook my world\u201d, she said. She remembers yelling to her husband, \u201cbring my baby home to me,\u201d as he went to pick him up.  The two Hollywood stars joined hundreds of other parents in New York City on Saturday, marching across the Brooklyn Bridge in a call for stricter gun control laws. The march, organized by Moms Demand Action, a gun control group backed by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, was in its fourth year. It was first held in January 2013, a month after the shootings in Newtown.  \u201cWhat do we want? Gun sense!\u201d the protesters chanted, as they moved slowly across the bridge. \u201cWhen do we want it? Now!\u201d  One Long Island eight-year-old held up a sign that asked: \u201cWho is afraid of a background check?\u201d A mother from Rhode Island held a placard that read: \u201c178 school shootings since Sandy Hook #NotOneMore.\u201d  Some parents, including Barbara Parker, whose daughter Alison was shot dead on live television nine months ago, were holding photographs of the children they lost. \u201cNothing will bring back Alison,\u201d Parker, 66, said at a subsequent rally in lower Manhattan. \u201cBut we will not stop until every one of the NRA-funded politicians who offer thoughts and prayers but do not act are voted out of office.\u201d Parker said her daughter, a 24-year-old journalist killed in front of 60,000 viewers, was \u201ca victim of an angry man who should never been able to purchase a gun\u201d.   Related: Gun control groups march across Brooklyn Bridge to demand action    Together with Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action claims 3 million members nationwide.  The groups push for what advocates call common-sense gun measures, including closing loopholes in existing background check laws, keeping guns \u201cout of the hands of stalkers and terrorists\u201d, tighter regulations for gun dealers, and efforts to encourage gun owners to store their guns locked and unloaded.  \u201cI fervently believe that this is not a partisan issue,\u201d Moore said at the rally. \u201cThis is not an an anti-gun or pro-gun argument. This is not a second amendment issue, it does not deserve to be hotly debated as such. It is a safety issue. \u201cA majority of us are on the same side, and yet our federal government seems to be deadlocked.\u201d Moore told the crowd she had been able to keep the news about Sandy Hook from her daughter for only a few hours. As soon as they got home, her daughter looked at her phone and asked: \u201cMommy, did a bunch of little kids get shot today?\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s when I felt ridiculous and that it was reprehensible of me to try to keep my daughter safe by shielding her from news,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIf I really wanted to keep her safe and be a responsible parent, then I needed to help prevent an atrocity like this from ever happening to anyone else in this country.\u201d  Hart said that even though she is a \u201cHollywood girl\u201d she is not a Democrat, as people tend to assume. \u201cI vote Republican mostly,\u201d she said.  When people hear that, they assume she is vehemently pro-gun.  \u201cI don\u2019t fit in a box,\u201d she said.  Speaking to the Guardian, Hart said: \u201cI think the second amendment is important but there are ways to protect ourselves, the same way we put a helmet on our children when they ride a bike, or the same way you can only buy two packages of Sudafed at the pharmacy.

I thought about the first responders and what they had experienced.  \u201cThat was my moment. That\u2019s when I decided it just wasn\u2019t good enough to send my prayers and hope it never happens to me.\u201d  Hart said it was \u201cabsolutely not the truth\u201d that gun control advocates wanted to take guns from ordinary Americans. She said she might even buy a smart gun if they were more available \u2013 something President Obama has made a political priority.  \u201cI\u2019ve gone hunting,\u201d Hart said. \u201cI do not own a gun but if those German handguns that have that fingerprint recognition on them \u2026 I would totally own a gun if I knew it wouldn\u2019t be used in my home against the wrong person.\u201d When her kids have playdates, Hart said, she always asks if the family has a gun and if so, how they store it. She sees the angry criticism that gun control advocates receive as a barrier to people getting involved in gun advocacy.  When she tweeted that she was coming to Saturday\u2019s rally, the response was \u201chate\u201d and \u201cpushback\u201d, she said.  \u201cI\u2019m not here to take anyone\u2019s rights away,\u201d she added, \u201cbut the most basic human right is a child to be able to grow up and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d At the rally, advocates decried the lack of action in Congress and celebrated recent victories at the state level, including the vetoing by the governor of Georgia of a campus carry bill.  \u201cSome cynics said our movement would fade away and our outrage was a flash in the pan,\u201d Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, told the cheering crowd. \u201cThe gun lobby now knows that tough mothers by the thousands are here to stay.\u201d   Related: Gun manufacturer CEO says 'we are good citizens' as gun sales surge    As the march wound slowly across the tourist-packed Brooklyn Bridge, some people said they supported the effort. Camilla Bommen, 45, a tourist visiting from Norway, paused to watch the march go by.  \u201cI sort of think of gun violence when I hear \u2018the United States of America\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a problem here to a much greater extent than we do in Europe. I think it\u2019s crazy that it\u2019s so easy to get a gun here.\u201d Others on the bridge were more skeptical. Thane Kerner, 54, a software investor from New York, said the protesters\u2019 slogans seemed to oversimplify America\u2019s complex history with firearms and the second amendment.  Kerner said he was concerned that gun control activists wanted to limit civilian access to guns, without thinking through what it would be mean to have weapons only in the hands of police or powerful elites.  \u201cI look in their faces \u2013 I see this earnestness, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be informed by any of the nuances,\u201d he said.  Listening to the \u201cgun sense\u201d chants, Kerner noted, his wife had said: \u201cIt sounds like, \u2018What do we want? Nonsense!\u2019\u201d",
