  "body": "Hi Lenny! You\u2019ve just put out a blues album, New Millennium Blues. What is it with comedians and the blues (1) ?  The blues has been in my life since I was little. My parents had this massive record player in the living room, a \u201cblue spot grand\u201d they called it ... it used up an entire rainforest to make this thing, and it had all these records in it. Some were rock, some were reggae, but a lot was blues \u2013 Ray Charles, Chuck Berry and all that stuff. Are you falling into the stereotype of the funny man being sad behind the scenes?  I don\u2019t know about that. I listen to lots of blues records and some of them are funny. BB King\u2019s How Blue Can You Get is hilarious. \u201cI gave you six children and now you wanna give \u2018em back\u201d ... that\u2019s funny! Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s Meet Me In The Bottom, which I cover on my album, is another example \u2013 he talks about climbing out of a woman\u2019s window because her husband\u2019s coming to get him and it\u2019s really funny! Prince does a joke right in the middle of Vicki Waiting: \u201cWhy is your organ so small? I didn\u2019t know I was playing in a cathedral!\u201d Now I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s basically a Bernard Manning joke! What are you doing Prince?!         The Cops Don\u2019t Know, the single from Henry\u2019s album New Millennium Blues    When did you start writing music?  I\u2019ve written songs since the beginning of the 80s. I did a character called Theophilus P Wildebeeste (2) on television, and all of these record companies tried to sign me because they thought they could make a fast buck out of it. I was flattered into thinking they would help imprint the brand, or some shit like that, but actually I ended up feeling that doing novelty records tarnished the music I love. It\u2019s fine doing impressions on the telly \u2013 Michael Jackson or Earth, Wind & Fire, or something \u2013 but an album is different. You should do it properly. I went through a period of working with various people, including Trevor Horn, but then my mum said: \u201cThat\u2019s another job! that\u2019s a whole other career! Don\u2019t be stupid!\u201d So I hung my hat on comedy and that was that. Until now \u2026 Recently, I just thought: \u201cWhy not take on things you\u2019re frightened of?\u201d So I started working with Jakko Jakszyk (3) \u2013 I sent him some lyrics and a few days later these demos starting arriving on my computer. We went into the studio and I\u2019ve got massive respect for anyone who does that for a living \u2013 it\u2019s a nerve-wracking experience!     \u2018Doing novelty records tarnished the music I love\u2019: Henry as Theophilus P Wildebeeste. Photograph: Alamy    The title track of your album takes aim at the obesity crisis, celebrity culture, kids hooked on virtual reality and hurricanes. Which is the worst? (Laughs) I think that was a litmus test for what\u2019s going on at the moment. The list goes on and on \u2026 just look at food banks. I was in Uganda years ago talking about food banks. Who would have thought we\u2019d have them in our country? You just wouldn\u2019t, the world has changed. And that song is a list of all the things you notice. Was it your stab at being Marvin Gaye?  Inner City Blues, it was trying to find the 21st-century equivalent of that. I thought: what would make Marvin Gaye holler now?   Related: Lenny Henry on Prince: 'I almost passed out. This was my hero talking to me'    The Cops Don\u2019t Know is inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement in the US \u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s awful. The Guardian has got this thing where it counts all the people who get shot mistakenly by police (4) and it\u2019s in the thousands now. It\u2019s just a matter of fact that there are more black men in prison, more getting shot, more being profiled \u2026 the police see an 11-year-old and they immediately think they\u2019re 18. And they say things like: \u201cHe came towards me, frothing at the mouth, he was like an animal, I drew my weapon, I got scared.\u201d It\u2019s an 11-year-old kid, what the hell\u2019s going on?! Barack Obama is sick of talking about it, we\u2019re getting inured to it \u2026 why are we inured to people opening fire on innocent citizens? If we\u2019re not careful it could happen here soon. I love that Robin Williams joke: \u201cThe police in Britain shout \u201cStop! Or I\u2019ll shout stop again!\u201d I\u2019m happy for that to continue. Did you experience racist police growing up? I experienced racism. So did my mum and my dad and my brothers. I grew up as a black person in a black family and racism was part of our lives. At one point in my life I had a fight nearly every day just on my way to school \u2013 getting called names or whatever. But it\u2019s institutionalised too. People are scared to have the word \u201cracism\u201d bandied about because it\u2019s a raw word. They think you\u2019re having a go but you\u2019re not. Things are changing, though. There\u2019s a coalition of the willing emerging who realise it\u2019s a rigged deck, and want make it a level playing field. You wrote about meeting your hero Prince in the Guardian recently. You said he cornered you for 90 minutes to talk about his Warner Bros contract \u2026 Yeah! Although I\u2019m such a big fan that I didn\u2019t really mind. He was incensed that they owned all his masters. It was basically a very early conversation about intellectual property and how creators should own their product. He was saying: \u201cIt went from my mind, my soul, on to tape \u2013 the record company shouldn\u2019t own the tape!\u201d It was great, though, and he was good company. He was funny. Did you meet him on other occasions? Yeah, I also introduced him on Top of the Pops, when he was wearing a red scarf over his face and singing a song called Get Wild. It was one of the best nights of my life. I got to see him close up \u2013 he was playing the bass, and after every performance he ran up to the gallery to watch the performance, then came down again to do it again. He did it about five times. He was very particular about the performance and that taught me a great deal. Don\u2019t just accept it when someone says: \u201cyep, we\u2019ve got this!\u201d You can always do it again. He almost wanted to direct and control everything, and that was a lesson to be learned. These people, multi-instrumentalists who write and play, are a multiple threat. And the people who produce and direct are scared of that because it puts them out of a job. Your band Poor White Trash (5) played Jeremy Paxman\u2019s birthday party. Is that one of the weirdest gigs ever played? Yeah! We did a lot of birthday parties and wrap parties (6). Hugh Laurie would normally be looking at me going: \u201cI\u2019m in a band! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in a band!\u201d We loved it. You might not be Stevie Wonder but you can hold a tune and make a crowd move and dance. I saw Mo Mowlam and Jeremy Paxman getting down to Sex Machine \u2013 not a lot of people have done that! Footnotes (1) Noted delta bluesman Hugh Laurie has put out two albums in the last few years. (2) A parody of soul lothario Teddy Pendergrass, right down to the initials. (3) Currently occupying the role of lead singer in King Crimson. (4) The Counted recorded 1145 people killed by police in the US in 2015. At the time of publication, the figure for 2016 is 350. (5) Band featuring Lenny Henry, Hugh Laurie, Ade Edmonson and Ben Elton\u2019s wife, Sophie. (6) The Sense And Sensibility wrap party was especially wild, according to Lenny.",
