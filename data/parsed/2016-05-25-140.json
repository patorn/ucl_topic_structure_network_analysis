  "body": "I really like this book because it keeps you guessing all the way through. You jump from page to page to help Ethan solve a mystery and whilst doing it you can doodle the characters, rip out pages and fold them up. It seemed a bit strange writing in a reading book but I really enjoyed doing it and it felt a bit wrong too. But when you get into the book it\u2019s really exciting ticking boxes, drawing balloons, muffins and lots of other things to help Ethan with his secret spy mission.      I have already told two of my friends about this book because I\u2019m sure they will like it just as much as me. It\u2019s more than a book - you get to play a big part in it. Almost like being the author and illustrator yourself!  Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop  Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? Join the site and send us your review!",
