While economists say the two industries most likely to be scaled back if we leave the EU are the automative industry and financial services, leading to a loss of up to 950,000 jobs, others are more optimistic about our chances if we leave the European Union.  \u201cThe effect on the composition of jobs will really depend on the relationship we have with the EU after the referendum. If we remain part of the European Economic Area, and the full single market, there will be almost no change,\u201d says Ryan Bourne, head of public policy at the IEA and author of the EU jobs myth. So how can we work out what\u2019s most likely to happen? And what impact would leaving the EU have on your job or industry? Join us on Wednesday 25 May from 1pm-2.30pm BST for a live chat with the experts. We\u2019ll be discussing:  Which industries would be most affected by a Brexit. What a Brexit would mean for UK jobs. Things you need to know about careers in the aftermath of a Brexit.  The Q&A will take place in the comments section below this article.
