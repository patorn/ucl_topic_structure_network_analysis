  "body": "A different light is due to be shed on the idyllic ramblings of Gerald Durrell and his eccentric family in Corfu in a new biography of the Durrells, due out next year. Michael Haag, who knew Lawrence and Gerald Durrell and who is also currently writing a biography of Lawrence for Yale University Press, has been signed by Profile to write a biography of the Durrell family before, during and after their time in Corfu. Their sojourn on the island was covered in Gerald Durrell\u2019s much-loved Corfu trilogy My Family and Other Animals, Birds, Beasts and Relatives and The Garden of the Gods, which chart his adventures and explorations there, as well as in Lawrence Durrell\u2019s diary of life on the island, Prospero\u2019s Cell.   Related: If you haven\u2019t read My Family and Other Animals, do so \u2013 preferably with a child    Haag said that Gerald\u2019s books are only very loosely based on actual events, with the family travelling to Corfu not, as recounted in My Family and Other Animals, because of Lawrence\u2019s desire for sun, but to keep the family together. According to Haag, their mother Louisa was drinking heavily and getting over a breakdown. Her drinking \u201cwas actually very serious,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir mother was rather a fragile person and quite spaced out psychologically. They came to Corfu not because he wanted to come to Corfu with his wife and to live the life of an artist. He couldn\u2019t leave his mother behind in Bournemouth, he was terrified of what might happen, so he had to bring the whole family.\u201d The four children - Gerald, Lawrence, Margo and Leslie - \u201csort of propped up their mother as a group,\u201d said Haag. \u201cAnd in propping her up, they propped themselves up \u2026 an old friend [of Lawrence\u2019s] said that visiting the Durrell family in Bournemouth, before the Corfu days, was a life-enhancing experience \u2013 he said they were such a knockabout bunch of people, everyone shouting, laughing, making jokes.\u201d Haag pointed to a line from My Father and Other Animals when on leaving Corfu an official describes the Durrells as \u201cone travelling Circus and staff\u2026 it was a sort of circus,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had that sort of quality.\u201d     The recent ITV drama The Durrells, staring Josh O\u2019Connor as Larry Durrell, Milo Parker as Gerry Durrell, Anna Savva as Lugaretza, Daisy Waterstone as Margo Durrell, Keeley Hawes as Louisa Durrell and Callum Woodhouse as Leslie Durrell. Photograph: PR Image    The Durrells of Corfu will be published by Profile in spring next year, coinciding with the second series of ITV\u2019s The Durrells, which is based loosely on the Corfu trilogy. The biography will also look at the family\u2019s time in India, where the children were born and where their civil engineer father died, at Margo\u2019s eventual return to Corfu to join the Greek resistance, and at Leslie\u2019s romance with the family\u2019s Corfiote maid and friend Maria Kondos in England. Haag has travelled the world in research of his material and has had access to archives, as well as to friends and family of the Durrells. He knew Lawrence Durrell, working with him professionally after commissioning him to write an introduction to EM Forster\u2019s Alexandria: A History and a Guide, and co-publishing the writer\u2019s The Durrell-Miller Letters, at Durrell\u2019s request. Visiting Durrell in the south of France, he met his family, and according to Profile, \u201cprobably knows more about the Durrells than anyone alive\u201d.   Related: The Durrells proves a rollicking delight for ITV    \u201cI am not writing of the Durrells during their Corfu years in the spirit of an expos\u00e9,\u201d said Haag, describing the family as \u201celusive - they covered their tracks \u2026 That\u2019s partly what all the laughing was about \u2013 they were constantly covering up what was going on with a laugh, a joke, a good story,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m writing about what happened before Corfu, and after Corfu - in Gerry\u2019s books they leave Corfu because his mother has decided that he needs an education, but they actually go back because the war has begun and it\u2019s not safe any more.\u201d The Corfu trilogy, said Haag, is a mixture \u201cof reality and invention\u201d, with the new television series adding \u201canother layer to that \u2026 of invention but also adding realities, like Louisa\u2019s drinking, that were not there in Gerry\u2019s accounts. And so a palimpsest develops and that becomes what the public knows. \u201cI want to reveal what\u2019s going on underneath,\u201d he said, predicting that the Durrells themselves would have found the fresh looks at their lives, both his own and on television, amusing. \u201cI think they would laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a time when Larry and Gerry went back to Corfu and went on a tour by boat, north to where Larry lived. They went with a group of other people, wore funny hats and glasses \u2013 they became tourists and very much enjoyed being told all about the Durrells. So I think they would enjoy this very much.\u201d",
