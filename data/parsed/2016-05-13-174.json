Speaking at the Cannes film festival, Bruno Dumont, the French director of L\u2019Humanit\u00e9, Flandres and Hors Satan, refuted the idea that one could or should set out to make films that could be termed \u201cEuropean\u201d.   Related: Ma Loute (Slack Bay) review - Juliette Binoche goes mesmerically over the top in bizarre seaside comedy    \u201c\u2018European films\u2019 are really bad,\u201d he told the press after the first screening of his new comedy Ma Loute (Slack Bay). \u201cYou make a local film, and that might become universal. You can\u2019t make a \u2018European film\u2019\u201d. Ma Loute, which is set in the early 20th, century near Calais, close to Dumont\u2019s birthplace, is a black comedy about the meeting of two families: the Van Peteghems, a bevvy of braying aristocrats, and the Bruforts, a working-class clan of mussel gatherers \u2013 with a sideline in murder and cannibalism.  The film stars Juliette Binoche as the eccentric Aude van Peteghem, whose transgender child, Billie (played by the French actor Raph), initiates a romance with the title character (Brandon Lavieville), drawing the two tribes together. The film features a number of outrageous set-pieces, including the Bruforts hunkering down to dine on a bucket of body parts and Binoche \u2013 cut, bruised and bandaged after a close call with the cannibals \u2013 burbling incomprehensibly about the writings of Victor Hugo. Dumont has twice won Cannes\u2019 \u201csecond prize\u201d, the Grand Prix. His films typically portray the darkest aspects of humanity, with little room for levity. But he said the experience of working on Ma Loute and his previous film, a knockabout comedy called P\u2019tit Quinquin, had helped him come to appreciate the \u201cnoble\u201d arts of comedy and caricature. \u201cI made these characters larger than life so you could really see them well,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to work with a telescope, now I work with a microscope\u201d.

This combination, these diametric qualities, enthral me\u201d. Fabrice Luchini plays Andr\u00e9 van Peteghem, the ineffectual, hunch-backed patriarch of the aristocrat family. In one scene the father makes a great show of offering the family aperitifs. Luchini, in referring to the scene, hijacked the press conference to complain about France\u2019s newfound obsession: cocktails. \u201cI hate the way people in France are fascinated by cocktails,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate waiting for dinner. French people are obsessed with this idea of drinking before they eat. I hate it.\u201d After Luchini\u2019s rant the moderator remarked that Luchini was an actor in every situation. \u201cOh my darling,\u201d said Luchini. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d",
