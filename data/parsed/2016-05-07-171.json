  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull is expected to officially start the longest election campaign in Australia since the 1960s when he visits Yarralumla today to ask for a double dissolution election on 2 July. All 150 House of Representatives seats and 76 Senate seats will be up for election.   Related: Beware tax cuts for 'Middle Australia'. Above-average earners benefit most    A faux-campaign has been under way for weeks, but the prime minister\u2019s visit to the governor general\u2019s official residence requesting the issuing of writs will formally begin an expected 56-day campaign, the longest since 1969\u2019s 66-day race, when the major party leaders were John Gorton and Gough Whitlam.  On Saturday, both the Coalition and Labor used the last non-campaign day, to outline their platforms for the election. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, downplayed the significance of the first poll released since Tuesday\u2019s budget, which showed a two-party preferred result of 50-50. The Seven-ReachTel poll found 33% of respondents believed they would be worse off under Morrison\u2019s first budget, while 59% said it would leave them \u201cabout the same\u201d. Just seven per cent thought they would be better off. Morrison said the government\u2019s budget wasn\u2019t about polls. \u201cThe budget is about laying out a national economic plan to ensure the economy can transition from the mining investment phase of the mining boom through to a more diversified economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you got from me this week was a national plan for jobs and growth. What you got from the opposition was all politics and no plan and that gives a very stark choice to the Australian people,\u201d Morrison told reporters in western Sydney. Unhelpfully for the Coalition, a staff member of former defence minister Kevin Andrews has been forced to quit over branch-stacking allegations in Andrews\u2019s safe seat of Menzies. Andrews, who has held the seat since 1991, is now under pressure to quit or face dis-endorsement. Labor leader Bill Shorten said the Liberal party was gearing up for a \u201ccivil war\u201d after the election, between the \u2018small-l\u2019 liberals behind Malcolm Turnbull, and so-called \u2018mal-content\u2019 conservatives who are still supportive of deposed prime minister Tony Abbott. \u201cWe know they\u2019re going to have that fight. Let\u2019s all make them have it from opposition.\u201d Shorten declared Labor would fight the campaign as an \u201ceducation election\u201d. \u201cWe will put the funding on the table to make sure every teacher in Australia gets the recognition and the support to back up what they do every day,\u201d he said. Promising to fully fund the Gonski education reforms, he rhetorically asked teachers in Sydney: \u201cWho do you trust to properly fund education?\u201d But the Liberal party deputy leader, Julie Bishop, hit back at Shorten, declaring he was making promises and raising expectations on education that he couldn\u2019t meet.   Related: Truth the first casualty as Coalition and Labor give in to tug of class war | Lenore Taylor    \u201cWe have increased funding for education that\u2019s been paid for, not pie-in-the-sky promises that Bill Shorten has made that haven\u2019t been paid for,\u201d Bishop said. In Melbourne to launch the Greens campaign, party leader Richard Di Natale said the Greens had never been in better shape and were aiming to pick up a swathe of lower house seats. \u201cIf these seats don\u2019t turn Green at this election they\u2019ll turn Green at the next or the next one after that,\u201d he said. The independent senator Nick Xenophon, whose newly-formed Nick Xenophon Team, is forecast to poll strongly in his home state of South Australia, urged \u201ca pox on both their houses\u201d, referring to the major parties. He thought Malcolm Turnbull would win and the election was his to lose. \u201cBill Shorten needs to be not a small target and be pretty bold to give himself a fighting chance,\u201d Xenophon said.
