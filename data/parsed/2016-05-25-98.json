Related: All-day breakfast awakens McDonald's sales for a third consecutive quarter    Rensi, who was the CEO of McDonald\u2019s US in the 1990s, said a national minimum wage of $15 an hour \u2013 which is being pushed for by an alliance of labor unions and workers \u2013 was nonsense and would lead to \u201cjob loss like you could not believe\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to have a federal minimum wage. The states ought to decide what the minimum wage is based on the cost of living in the states they are in. You don\u2019t need a $15 minimum wage in communities that have a standard of living which is substantially lower than in New York City,\u201d he said. After a quick pause, he added: \u201cOK, maybe the wage ought to be higher in New York.\u201d  Members of the Fight for $15 movement, however, have said they would keep fighting until all workers across the nation were earning $15 an hour. The majority of their protests have been focused on McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain.  McDonald\u2019s has shrugged off years of declining sales in recent quarters. In April, the company announced that its first quarter sales at US locations rose by 5.4%, largely thanks to the introduction of all-day breakfast. This was a third quarter in a row that McDonald\u2019s announced an increase in sales. Last year its global profits topped $7bn. George McCray, who works at McDonald\u2019s in Chicago, Illinois, and earns the local minimum wage of $8.25 an hour, would like the company to pass some of its profits on to the workers.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to make new changes like the all-day breakfast a success and have helped make the company billions, but our wages haven\u2019t budged. How much longer will McDonald\u2019s workers have to wait before the company\u2019s success benefits us too?\u201d he asked.  According to the Fight for $15 movement, about 10,000 workers are expected to protest in front of the McDonald\u2019s headquarters during the fast-food giant\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday. The campaign said it would be \u201cthe largest-ever protest to hit the shareholder meeting\u201d. However, after New York and California have passed legislation that would see their state minimum wages increased to $15 an hour, the Fight for $15 movement has lost some of its momentum. In April, the campaign planned what they hoped to be the largest day of action yet. However, the turnout at some of the events planned was about half of what it had been the year before.    Related: Fight for $15 protesters across US demand living wage in day of action    The campaign has been largely funded by the Service Employees International Union in the hope that the workers would also organize and push for union recognition in their respective McDonald\u2019s stores. This past weekend, at the SEIU National Convention, a delegation of fast-food workers from the Fight for $15 movement announced that they wanted to join the SEIU pending votes by cooks and cashiers at stores across the country.  When he appeared on Fox Business on Tuesday, Rensi also focused on the labor movement\u2019s role in the protests.  \u201cAll this nonsense with McDonald\u2019s minimum wage, work rules, it\u2019s all about union dues. It\u2019s about organizing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a theater of protests to capture votes for the Democratic party. It\u2019s absolute nonsense. It\u2019s a sham and it\u2019s destroying the middle class in this country.\u201d  Fight for $15 members insist that higher minimum wage and ability to unionize will help \u201clift\u201d low-wage workers out of poverty and into the middle class.  \u201cOur decision to ask to join SEIU underscores the fact that we want not just $15 an hour, but union rights too,\u201d said Guadalupe Salazar, one of the McDonald\u2019s workers attending the SEIU convention. \u201cWe are sending a powerful message to companies like McDonald\u2019s that we are going to keep fighting until we win an organization that helps lift up not just fast-food workers, but all underpaid workers.\u201d",
