  "body": "Spoiler alert: this recap assumes you\u2019ve seen the final episode of Undercover. Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t. \u201cPolice please \u2013 there\u2019s going to be a murder.\u201d My god it was gripping in that clearing. When Nick dials 999, when the mystery Scotsman emerges eerily from behind a tree, spied by the reporter Brady, when Maya and the kids bundle into the car to rush to their dad\u2019s rescue. When the Scotsman turns his gun on Dan and fires, Nick sprints towards his chest-wounded son, and Maya screams in raw despair. I may even have gasped.  You may equally have scoffed \u2013 at the lovely family racing to save the dad they\u2019ve just discovered is a dissembling undercover cop. But I found the climax in the forest a fine few minutes of television. It was the aftermath, and indeed the bulk of what came before, that was not such good television. As I see it, Undercover\u2019s great potential \u2013 brilliant cast, huge angry knotty issues \u2013 has been fatally undermined by implausibilities. I know we always have to suspend a bit of disbelief, but it\u2019s hardly ideal to leave your audience hollering at copious plotholes every couple of scenes, is it? There\u2019s still so much that fails to add up. Why did it take Maya so long to investigate Michael Antwi\u2019s death? Why is she still driving when she has epilepsy? And can it really all come down to the elected mayor of Baton Rouge? Did the minister of justice and the mystery Scotsman enlist Antwi to assassinate the mayor? Why have they expended so much energy and evilness to cover this up for so long \u2013 to stop a riot? Nick\u2019s work seems unlikely \u201cto make the world a safer place\u201d. Surely he\u2019s just there to save face for them. The triumvirate of evil\u2019s reasoning was: \u201cwe\u2019ve been making sure police officers are not put on trial. We live in a tolerant society and none of us want to disturb that.\u201d It seems so weak.      Maya overturns the US constitution, with a little help from Rudy. Photograph: Sally Mais/BBC    Though the bid for justice didn\u2019t work out so well in London, yet, Maya actually did overturn the US constitution. Her argument before the Supreme Court to prove that the death penalty was cruel and unconstitutional swerved from slavery to superheroes to linguistics to racism, and finally to pain (very topical). But she can\u2019t offer any hard evidence. Rudy Jones can, though. It\u2019s a miracle! What a recovery from the man who came out of a lethal-injection-induced coma to give a lengthy, rousing and history-defining speech. The excellent Dennis Haysbert gave it his best go, but why did no one veto this secondary strand in the States? Police brutality in Britain would have been quite enough for one script.      Will the minister of justice finally be held to account? Photograph: Sally Mais/BBC    But forget all that: Nick\u2019s finally written a book! \u201cThis is my story\u201d \u2013 hardly going to go down in history as a classic opening line. But perhaps, as he says in his scrawled autobiography, life is such a random \u201cragbag of incoherent happenings\u201d (oh the irony) that it\u2019s natural a drama would leave us with the real villain on the loose \u2013 \u201cmy freedom is unrestricted\u201d \u2013 and Nick still loved by his family. At least Brady will break the story of the two-decade cover-up and hold the minister and the mystery Scotsman to account \u2013 and Maya, Clem, Ella and Dan will get to learn Nick\u2019s true identity, his real name at last. My money\u2019s on Barry.  \u2018Go big\u2019 speech of the week True to form, it goes to Maya, after she realised that Michael Antwi murdered the man who landed Rudy Jones on death row, and that the mystery Scotsman has got off scot free for shooting her son: \u201cI\u2019m going to go bigger.\u201d The words we\u2019ve all been dreading. See you back here for the second series, folks.  Notes and observations \u2022 It is kind of shocking, at a push, that Antwi murdered the mayor elect of Baton Rouge \u2013 though we have no idea why, and no idea of the larger transatlantic link, so it still feels too tangential for the denouement. But no matter how much it might shatter Maya\u2019s belief in Antwi and her 20-year cause, it surely wouldn\u2019t stop her seeking justice for all black men killed in police custody, trying to make the house fall down \u201clike it should\u201d. \u2022 Why did Nick break his own wrist? I know he needed to record the MOJ\u2019s admission for Maya, but wouldn\u2019t the Scotsman ask why the hell he turned up to their meeting with a cartoonish bump on his arm, rather than hotfoot it to A&E? And couldn\u2019t he just use his phone, or put a recording device in his pocket, or his crotch, like a normal person?  \u2022 I\u2019ve found Adrian Lester\u2019s performance fairly wooden and underwhelming throughout Undercover, but I did think he gave a powerhouse in the scene where he appealed to the Scotsman for the truth: \u201cI gave you Abi \u2013 I gave up one of our own for you. You\u2019ve made me part of a conspiracy to murder. I gave you Michael\u2019s mum, man, probably the best human being I have ever met. How much more of me do you want without telling me what this is all for?\u201d What a shame the fine performance was sandwiched with the unnecessary wrist-breaking incident.  \u2022 I loved the moment when the Scotsman threatened the minister: \u201cYou do what I say or I will cut your small and average penis off, chop it up and send slices of spotted dick to all the women in your life.\u201d What a, err, ballsy takedown.  \u2022 Dan\u2019s list of questions to ask Lola the undercover bint was an exceptional dating crib sheet: \u201cHow old are you? Where do you live? Are you happy?\u201d Thank god Nick caught her snooping and realised her game. I still can\u2019t believe he got shot.  \u2022 Did the minister really compare Maya to a sonderkommando?  \u2022 I know the final seconds were all a big, saddening set-up for series two but let\u2019s look on the bright side: at least it didn\u2019t all come down to Big Ray.",
