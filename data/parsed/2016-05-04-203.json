  "body": "\u201cUnconcious, systemic bias\u201d in the film industry is to blame for the lack of women in directing and screenwriting roles, according to the leading organisation of UK film directors.   Related: Give half of UK film funding to projects led by women, directors say    A report commissioned by Directors UK found that between 2005 and 2014, just 13.6% of British films were directed by women, and that only 14.6% of those films had a female screenwriter.  The organisation is calling for gender parity in public funding, pointing to success in Sweden after a similar model was introduced.  If you work in the film industry, we want to hear from you. Are you a woman working as or working towards a role as a director or screenwriter? What do you think of the proposal for half of all public funding to go to female-led projects by 2020? You can share your story with us by filling out the form below, and we\u2019ll use some of what you tell us as part of our coverage.",
