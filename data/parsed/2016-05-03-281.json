A block away, its entrance guarded by two of the city\u2019s landmark skyscrapers, Torre Mayor and Torre Bancomer, is Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, once the grande dame of Mexico City neighbourhoods, and now making a long-awaited comeback.  A few kilometres west of the historic centre, Ju\u00e1rez used to be the grandest colonia in the city. Local architect Rutilo Rojas says: \u201cAt the tail end of the porfiriato [when Porfirio D\u00edaz ruled Mexico, 1876-1911], wealthy families built enormous French-influenced mansions in Ju\u00e1rez, and lived there until the mid-century\u2019s new urban developments began. Many demolished their mansions and replaced them with office blocks, which were easier to rent out.\u201d     Lucerna Comedor recently opened on Calle Lucerna in La Ju\u00e1rez.    The horrific earthquake of 1985 sent the area into further decline. In the 1980s and 90s, a small pocket of Ju\u00e1rez, Zona Rosa, became a centre for the city\u2019s gay scene, full of clubs and restaurants, but the rest of the area lay dormant. Now, developers such as regeneration specialist ReUrbano are helping restore its beautiful architecture. A wave of openings over the past six months has seen interest in Ju\u00e1rez reach fever pitch. Havre 77 is an oyster bar and restaurant from feted young chef Lalo Garc\u00eda; other new spots include Lucerna Comedor, Teo Luncheonette, Taberna Luciferina, Osteria Isabella and Kyo Sushi. Milan 44 is an \u201curban market\u201d where people can go for excellent coffee and cheese, a beard trim or a yoga class. In the past three years, three of Mexico City\u2019s most exciting contemporary art galleries \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, Marso and Karen Huber \u2013 have opened in Ju\u00e1rez.     Milan 44, a modern market offering gourmet food, yoga and more.    But the most anticipated newcomer is Amaya, a new restaurant and wine bar from Jair T\u00e9llez, the chef behind two of Mexico\u2019s best restaurants \u2013 Mexico City\u2019s MeroToro and Baja California\u2019s Laja. It opens on 20 May and will boast Mexico\u2019s first entirely natural wine list. For T\u00e9llez, Ju\u00e1rez is a fusion of the best of new and old Mexico City: \u201cA wave of creativity has made its way across the city and hit the spinal cord of Avenida Reforma. You don\u2019t know what to expect here, and that makes it very exciting.\u201d     La Ju\u00e1rez remains proudly local, with low rents and a mixed community.    Indeed: the area is also home to classic cantinas unchanged since the 1920s, such as Salon Niza, and to some of the city\u2019s most exciting theatre, cabaret and multi-disciplinary performance spaces: Teatro Milan, Foro 37, El Milagro, El 77 and La Americana Club. Then there\u2019s the wonderful Korean food at Mapo Galbi, Mexico City\u2019s first serious cocktail bar, Bar Milan, and Caf\u00e9 La Habana, which opened in 1952 and is said to be where Fidel Castro and Che Guevara planned the Cuban revolution. But Ju\u00e1rez still remains proudly local, with its launderettes and cocinas econ\u00f3micas (budget restaurants). Rents are still low enough for artists and independent businesses to survive, and large restaurant chains have so far stayed away. Long may it last.",
