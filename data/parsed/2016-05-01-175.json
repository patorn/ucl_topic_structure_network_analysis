  "body": "This message movie sequel is essentially a feature-length advertisement for Jesus. Melissa Joan Hart stars as Grace (get it?), a teacher who happens to make a passing reference to Jesus during a class discussion. She is hauled over the coals by mealy-mouthed non-believers in a courtroom drama which owes more to pantomime than legal procedure. Shot in holy high-definition, with lots of histrionic crane shots that swoop down like angels from on high and a score that batters the audience into observance, this is a film that will work best when preaching to the converted.         Watch the trailer for God\u2019s Not Dead 2.",
