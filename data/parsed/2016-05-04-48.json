After some glorious revolution, \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d will be attended to. I have heard this all my life, and I am hearing it\u00a0again now when I talk of my support for the Women\u2019s Equality party (WEP). Comrades have informed me that the WEP is a single-issue party and that women are a \u201cminority interest\u201d. It\u00a0is amazing to me that we will see driverless cars before we see equal pay, that whenever women speak up\u00a0we are told this is not the right time and that we are not representative enough, often by those\u00a0inhabiting political spaces entirely dominated by men. The Women\u2019s Equality party is actually Britain\u2019s fastest-growing party, with 45,000 members, though it only came into being a year ago through\u00a0a of mixture of impatience and hope. As\u00a0soon as the idea was floated, its founders were inundated with emails from people who wanted in. Some have not been engaged in politics for years, some are totally fed up with the traditional parties, some are seasoned campaigners, some are teenagers. So the idea became a reality fast. It was impressive to see a party forming. This involved a\u00a0phenomenal amount of work, from funding to writing a constitution, creating a party structure and coordinating the branches that sprang up spontaneously all over the county. The phrase \u201cIf\u00a0you want something done, ask a busy woman\u201d has never been more apt. It has been a steep learning curve from somewhat giddy meetings to\u00a0fielding candidates. Mistakes have been made,\u00a0but the commitment to doing something new is real. Our core objectives are: equal representation in business, industry and politics; equal pay; equal parenting; equality\u00a0in the education system; equal treatment by and in the media; and an end to violence against women. This may sound like very basic stuff, but we are a long way off from achieving it and although the other parties have \u201cequality\u201d polices, they don\u2019t enact them.   Related: Women\u2019s Equality party founders: \u2018It needed doing. So we said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it\u201d\u2019    Our concerns are not the concerns of a handful of liberal feminists \u2013 yes, I have heard all the\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just ladies who lunch\u201d criticism \u2013 because to achieve any of our goals requires a fundamental shake-up. To change the way childcare is structured; to understand that care is not some \u201cunproductive\u201d bit of the economy; to ask why, when austerity hit, it was\u00a0women in the frontline; or see domestic violence services being run down; to watch George Osborne casually impoverishing a generation of women by putting up the pension age \u2013 all these things require us to see how the current economic analysis works against the most\u00a0vulnerable. Many will argue that all this can only be tackled within existing party structures, to which I can only say: why hasn\u2019t it been? Why is gender equality continually pushed to the bottom of the\u00a0agenda? From the outset, the WEP insisted it was going to\u00a0do politics differently. We would be non-partisan and work with any other party where we\u00a0could find common ground. This has been an\u00a0education in breaking down some of politics\u2019 stultifying tribalism and has allowed us to draw on vast experience and expertise. Another achievement is to help our\u00a0candidates with bursaries for childcare because many women cannot afford to enter public life. This is walking it like we talk it. Still, I\u00a0know, we are too radical for some, not radical enough for others. My own view is we will be part\u00a0of a coalition of forces that exists outside of Westminster politics pushing for\u00a0change. The Westminster lot remain sneery, though, unable to\u00a0see that many women don\u2019t vote at all. One of\u00a0the surprises has been the big\u00a0support from men. On the doorstep, WEP canvassers have been met with: \u201cWhat took you\u00a0so long?\u201d   Related: I\u2019m a lifelong Tory but my vote\u2019s going to the Women\u2019s Equality party. Here\u2019s why | Kate Maltby    A big part of what we are about is shifting the conversation and that\u2019s why we are not simply a pressure group. Only when you threaten to take votes do other parties respond. Sadiq Khan and Zac Goldsmith, for instance, have had to field\u00a0questions about what they will do about London\u2019s rape figures or the huge pay gap in a\u00a0way that is unprecedented because of WEP\u2019s\u00a0presence. Also unprecedented is the diversity of our candidates. In our London list we have 30% BAME and 30% LGBT. We know we have to act intersectionally. We know there is more than one kind of discrimination and we know that many may share our aims but cannot give us all their votes so, strangely enough, we are not asking for them. Just half of them. In London, you get four votes, so give us two. On the orange ballot paper, help us get us on the Greater London Assembly. In Scotland and Wales, give one of your two votes on the\u00a0party list. In 2016, it is extraordinary that we have to vote to push basic equality to the top of the agenda instead of paying it lip service, but we do. Progress has stalled. We are the start-up.",
