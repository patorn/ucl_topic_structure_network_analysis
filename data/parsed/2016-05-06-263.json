  "body": "I leave my post as chief executive of the NHS Confederation this week to return to being chief executive of an NHS foundation trust.  We are in the middle of ambitious change, moving to a world of looking at the whole person and of redefining health in terms of mental, physical and social issues. We want to deliver the triple aim of closing the health gap, the care gap and the finance gap in every part of England. This is a monumental task that fundamentally challenges the way care is designed and delivered. It will take time, resilience, resources, leadership and the commitment of 1.3 million NHS staff and 1.5 million social care staff. We are either witnessing the birthing pains of a new health and care system or the slow and painful demise of the NHS. Both outcomes are still in play. There are five steps my successor will need to take.  First, we have to continue with improvements to the national system of the Department of Health and its arm\u2019s length bodies. NHS Confederation members believe very strongly that the plethora of arm\u2019s length bodies act in a contradictory way with conflicting policies that get in the way of change. We need a more coherent narrative, less intervention and a continued commitment to devolution. We need local solutions for local problems backed by national support. Critically, we need time to deliver change on the ground. We must back and nurture integration pioneers and NHS vanguards, and resist any move to the next fad or pilot programme. Second, we must be honest about the money available. NHS spending is likely to fall per head of population and as a share of GDP by 2020. Social care spending will fall to less than 1% of GDP. The spending review and government commitment we lobbied for on behalf of our NHS members was tough for the NHS but could give us a fighting chance \u2013 yet this is now questionable. Social care pressures and public health budget cuts are bad social policy and bad economics. Instead of tackling the root causes, we have been left to fix the problem through our hospitals and health services.  Transformation and sustainability funds are a positive opportunity. Other areas have yet to see the benefits and holding the government to its commitments is a must. I have to highlight parity of esteem as one example where all groups were united in our 2015 Challenge work, yet political rhetoric has failed to translate into sufficient funding for mental health services across the country.  To realise the Five Year Forward View we need local leadership, great commissioning and real investment in prevention, social care, primary care, community care and mental health.  Third, I strongly believe we must harness the power of communities, carers and patients. Our NHS Confederation Patients as Partners programme is starting to show how we can do this and the evidence is becoming unarguable. It can be challenging for us as providers but this may be the disruptive innovation that resets the deal between us, especially if we harness the power of technology in informing and connecting people.  Fourth, we need to rebuild the social contract with our staff and become a good employer. This is about more than pay and terms. This is the need to give our staff the genuine sense that we are looking after them and their careers.  The possibility of further strikes continues in the NHS. The government and NHS leaders must take stock on how we have reached this place. The NHS is made of people \u2013 not drugs, kit, buildings or committees. We should apply the same rigour to building a new approach with staff as we would with performance figures such as A&E targets. Finally, we need to support leaders in the NHS. Faced with the variability, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity they need to safely navigate through uncharted territory, with staff and citizens alongside them.  By moving back to the frontline, I become accountable for the safety of every patient and the value of every penny spent by South West Yorkshire partnership NHS foundation trust. I have also volunteered to be lead chief executive for creating the sustainability and transformation plan in West Yorkshire, which will demonstrate how the Five Year Forward View goes from political rhetoric to reality. I am willing to play my part \u2013 and I am clear that this is a great privilege. I will only succeed if the conditions are right that give birth to a new health and care system fit for the 21st century. We are not there yet and the alternative future of a slow and painful demise of the NHS cannot be allowed to happen. Whoever takes over here, the NHS Confederation has a key role to play in all our futures.    Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.
