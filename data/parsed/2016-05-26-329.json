  "body": "It was the early evening of 5 February 2013, and seated among grave-looking men in suits, a woman named Ada Colau was about to give evidence to a Spanish parliamentary hearing. \u201cBefore saying anything,\u201d she began, \u201cI\u2019d just like to make one thing clear. I am not an important person. I have never held office or been the president of anything \u2026 The only reason I am here is that I am a momentarily visible face of a citizens\u2019 movement.\u201d Colau was there to discuss the housing crisis that had devastated Spain. Since the financial crisis, 400,000 homes had been foreclosed and a further 3.4m properties lay empty. In response, Colau had helped to set up a grassroots organisation, the Platform for Mortgage Victims (PAH), which championed the rights of citizens unable to pay their mortgages or threatened with eviction. Founded in 2009, the PAH quickly became a model for other activists, and a nationwide network of leaderless local groups emerged. Soon, people across Spain were joining together to campaign against mortgage lenders, occupy banks and physically block bailiffs from carrying out evictions. Ten minutes into Colau\u2019s 40-minute testimony she broke from the script. Her voice cracking with emotion, she turned her attention to the previous speaker, Javier Rodriguez Pellitero, the deputy general secretary of the Spanish Banking Association: \u201cThis man is a criminal, and should be treated as such. He is not an expert. The representatives of financial institutions have caused this problem; they are the same people who have caused the problem that has ruined the entire economy of this country \u2013 and you keep calling them experts.\u201d When she had finished, the white-haired chair of the parliament\u2019s economic committee turned to Colau and asked her to withdraw her \u201cvery serious offences\u201d in slandering Pellitero. She shook her head and quietly declined. The \u201ccriminal\u201d video became a media sensation, earning Colau condemnation in some quarters and heroine status in others. A poll for the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds a few weeks later revealed that 90% of the country\u2019s population approved of the PAH. The group\u2019s work continued. In July 2013, Colau was photographed in Barcelona being dragged away by riot police from a protest against a bank that had refused to negotiate with an evicted family.         Ada Colau calls Javier Rodriguez Pellitero, the deputy general secretary of the Spanish Banking Association, a criminal    Two years later, that image went viral, powered by the extraordinary news that the same T-shirted activist had just been elected the new mayor of Barcelona. On the day of her inauguration, Colau addressed supporters of all ages gathered on the cobblestones in Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume in Barcelona\u2019s old town, thanking them for \u201cmaking the impossible possible\u201d. Some waved the tricolour of the Second Spanish Republic, which was declared in the very same square in April 1931; its egalitarian ideals buried in the rubble of the civil war five years later. The date of Colau\u2019s victory \u2013 24 May 2015 \u2013 was to be, in the words of one spray-painted graffiti slogan, \u201ca day that will last for years\u201d. Colau had been elected mayor on behalf of Barcelona en Com\u00fa, a new \u201ccitizens\u2019 movement\u201d backed by several leftwing parties. She became the city\u2019s first ever female mayor, and BCom\u00fa the first new party to gain power after 35 years dominated by the centre-left PSC and centre-right CiU. The date was not only significant in Barcelona. BCom\u00fa was one of several new groups that had defeated the established parties to win power in eight major Spanish cities, including Madrid, Valencia and Zaragoza. These new \u201cmayors of change\u201d became symbols of hope for what progressives in Spain sometimes call la nueva politica. It has become commonplace across the western world to talk of \u201cnew politics\u201d in response to voter apathy, economic crises, corruption and the decline of established political parties. In Spain, however, the phrase has a ring of truth to it. After years of social upheaval following the financial crisis, widespread uprisings against political and business elites have transformed the country\u2019s political landscape. Just as the Indignados, who occupied Spanish squares in their millions in the summer of 2011, inspired the global Occupy movement, it was in Spain, too, that this energy was first channelled into political movements capable of contesting elections, such as the leftwing populist party Podemos.   Related: The Podemos revolution: how a small group of radical academics changed European politics | Giles Tremlett    Colau has been involved every step of the way, and as mayor of the country\u2019s second-biggest city, she now possesses real political power \u2013 arguably more so than Podemos, which came third in the Spanish general election last December. The question Colau now faces is a vital one for the left across Europe: can she put her radical agenda into practice? * * * When I first met Colau last autumn, she was in the middle of an unusual transition, adapting from grassroots activism to life as an elected politician. Having started out at BCom\u00fa\u2019s spartan office, populated by young people hot-desking on laptops, she was now installed in Barcelona\u2019s 14th-century city hall, with its marble columns, stained glass and Mir\u00f3 statues. Her calendar had been taken over by a succession of official mayoral duties: gladhanding, exchanging gifts and small talk with dignitaries \u2013 death by a thousand micro-ceremonies. The demands on her time are especially intense, since it is central to BCom\u00fa\u2019s principles and media strategy that the organisation\u2019s figurehead stays on the same level as her supporters, taking public transport and attending neighbourhood BCom\u00fa meetings where possible.    She cut her own pay from \u20ac140,000 to \u20ac28,600 and replaced her predecessor\u2019s Audi with a more efficient mayoral minivan    In the weeks following her victory, Colau signalled what might be new about the new politics, with a series of headline-grabbing reforms. \u201cThis is the end of a political class removed from the people,\u201d she said, cutting expense accounts and salaries of elected officials. She announced she would reduce her own pay from \u20ac140,000 to \u20ac28,600, slashed the budget for her own inauguration ceremony, and replaced her predecessor\u2019s Audi with a more efficient mayoral minivan. (She was eventually blocked by political opponents from reducing her salary below \u20ac100,000 and has stated that she will donate the remaining sum to local groups.) She suggested withdrawing the annual \u20ac4m subsidy to Barcelona\u2019s Grand Prix circuit, restored school meal subsidies to the city\u2019s poorest children, and levied fines worth a total of \u20ac60,000 on banks that owned vacant properties. (At the posturing end of the spectrum of political action, she removed a bust of the recent King of Spain, Juan Carlos I, from the city hall\u2019s council chamber.) She also spent a night out with a homeless charity, helping to count how many people were sleeping rough in Barcelona (almost 900), met mobile phone company workers who were on strike, joined a demonstration against a controversial immigrant detention centre in the city, and returned to speak at the very same local assemblies that had brought BCom\u00fa to power in the first place. These initial moves encouraged Colau\u2019s supporters, but the challenge most likely to define her time in office will be taming Barcelona\u2019s tourist industry. In its transformation, since the 1992 Olympics, into the self-styled capital of the Mediterranean, and the fourth-most-visited city in Europe, Barcelona has become a victim of its own success. In the old town, evictions are common \u2013 a direct result of rents being driven up by tourist apartments \u2013 and residents complain that their neighbourhoods have become unlivable. \u201cYou really can\u2019t walk down some streets in the summer,\u201d one local told me, \u201cas in, you physically can\u2019t fit.\u201d The scale of the problem is made clear by a few simple figures: in 1990, Barcelona had 1.7 million visitors making overnight stays \u2013 only a little more than the population of the city; in 2016, the number has risen to more than eight million. In the intervening period, infrastructure and accommodation have been improved and expanded \u2013 pavements widened, signage increased, tour buses rerouted \u2013 but the problem is a fundamental one. Barcelona is a relatively small city. It is not London, Paris or New York. Major attractions such as the Sagrada Familia and Parc G\u00fcell are located in the middle of residential neighbourhoods, not surrounded by the open space they need to accommodate millions of visitors.     Tourism has grown enormously in Barcelona. In 1990 there were 1.7 million overnight visitors; in 2016 there more more than 8 million. Photograph: Dave Stelfox    As tourism has exploded, radically reshaping the city, the question of who Barcelona is ultimately for has become increasingly insistent. \u201cAny city that sacrifices itself on the altar of mass tourism,\u201d Colau has said, \u201cwill be abandoned by its people when they can no longer afford the cost of housing, food and basic everyday necessities.\u201d Everyone is proud of Barcelona\u2019s international reputation, Colau told me, but at what cost? \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Barcelona could risk losing its soul. We need to seek a fair balance between the best version of globalisation, and keeping the character, identity and life of the city. This is what makes it attractive \u2013 it is not a monumental city, and it is not a world capital like Paris \u2013 its main feature is precisely its life, its plurality, its Mediterranean diversity.\u201d \u201cWe want visitors to get to know the real Barcelona,\u201d she said \u2013 \u201cnot a \u2018Barcelona theme park\u2019 full of McDonald\u2019s and souvenirs, without any real identity.\u201d Even in the last few years, the change in Barcelona\u2019s old town is noticeable. The area is no longer dominated by locally owned restaurants, decked with laminated pictures of sangria and tortillas, or little shops selling matador costumes and Gaud\u00ed tea towels. Now its narrow cobbled streets are watched over by American Apparel, Starbucks, H&M, Disney and Foot Locker. Every now and then, as you stand in the Barrio Gotic and wonder whether the locals who refer to Barcelona as a \u201ctourist theme park\u201d are being hyperbolic, a bike tour \u2013 if you\u2019re particularly unlucky, a Segway tour \u2013 will spin around a tight corner and you will have to jump to avoid being body-slammed into an oversized paella dish. * * * While visitors come for the Gaud\u00ed mosaics, al fresco drinking and tapas, there is another side to Barcelona\u2019s culture \u2013 a history of barricades, pitched battles with police, and deeply held local neighbourhood identities \u2013 that long predates the rise of the tourist industry. In the early 20th century, this rebellious side of the city earned Barcelona the epithet la rosa de foc (the rose of fire). It was there that the radical trade union, the CNT, was founded; by 1919, it had more than 250,000 members in Barcelona alone. That same year, a 44-day-general strike held in the city secured for Spain the world\u2019s first national law on an eight-hour working day. Colau is not shy about expressing her respect for this heritage. She was born in 1974, in the twilight months of Franco\u2019s dictatorship, only a few hours after the execution of the prominent Catalan anarchist Salvador Puig Antich \u2013 an event that Colau has described as formative. Last autumn, she laid a wreath in honour of the anniversary of the execution of Catalan anarchist and educationalist Francesc Ferrer i Gu\u00e0rdia. It was, she said, thanks to the legacy of figures such as him that she, as an \u201cactivist, rebel and Catalan\u201d, could become mayor of the city. Colau grew up in Barcelona\u2019s Guinard\u00f3 neighbourhood, playing in the streets with her three sisters and other local children \u2013 the idealised Mediterranean upbringing where public space is everyone\u2019s living room. She grew up in a politicised household and participated in her first protests, at the age of 15, against the first Gulf war. She went on to study philosophy at the University of Barcelona and never considered becoming a politician. Later, she studied theatre for a year. When she was 27, she even appeared in a short-lived sitcom about three sisters called Dos + Una \u2013 she was the \u201cuna\u201d, the eldest of two twins. It was at the turn of the millennium, as the post-cold-war radical left began to coalesce around a series of anti-globalisation protests in the US and Europe, that Colau became more actively involved in politics. She recalls speaking on the telephone to friends in Genoa during the 2001 anti-G8 protests, after a police raid had left 63 protesters hospitalised. It is this period, she believes, that laid the groundwork for Spain\u2019s new wave of leftwing politics. \u201cI got involved in 2001 with anti-globalisation movements, against the war in Iraq and the World Bank, and global warming,\u201d she told me. \u201cFor hundreds of thousands of people, this was the beginning of their involvement with politics, and I still see the influence of this period at work today.\u201d Colau spent the first years of the new millennium embroiled in activism, protesting and campaigning against wars, poor housing and gentrification. While working for the PAH, she developed her distinctive style of speech, which rests on a sincere, if carefully crafted, populism. She has said that she wants to \u201cfeminise\u201d politics and avoids macho or old-left rhetoric. It is hard to imagine her saying, as the Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias once did, that \u201cHeaven is not taken by consensus \u2013 it is taken by assault.\u201d Instead, in speeches and interviews Colau returns again and again to a few central themes: human rights and democracy, participation, inclusion, justice. When I used the word \u201cradical\u201d at one point, she challenged it, \u201cBut what is radical? We are in a strange situation where defending democracy and human rights becomes radical.\u201d A key part of Colau\u2019s appeal is that, unlike many politicians, she is not afraid to show emotion. The famous 2013 parliamentary hearing was by no means the only time she has cried, or been close to tears, on camera. At rallies during the mayoral election campaign, she used the whole stage, gesticulating and speaking passionately about the city\u2019s most marginalised residents \u2013 women and children and pensioners and migrants and the unemployed \u2013 only letting herself uncoil from the performance once it was over and the BCom\u00fa supporters were on their feet. In person she is the same, speaking quickly and seriously, not seeming to pause for breath \u2013 then, when the message is delivered, she relaxes, often breaking out in laughter. When I met her on BCom\u00fa\u2019s symbolic 100th day in power, it was the middle of the Merce, Barcelona\u2019s week-long autumn cultural festival. That week it genuinely felt as though the doors of the city hall had been thrown open to the people: normally protected by security guards, the courtyard inside was thronged with festival performers and their families, in traditional Catalan folk costumes of red shirts and white trousers; there were piles of rucksacks on the floor, excited children darting about, and a baby being changed on an ancient oak bench.     Tourists outside the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. Photograph: Dave Stelfox    From the moment of her election victory, Colau had echoed the Zapatistas by promising to \u201cgovern by obeying the people\u201d, and that night she delivered a speech of studied humility. \u201cNever trust in our virtue or our ability to represent you completely,\u201d she told her supporters. \u201cThrow us out if we don\u2019t do what we said we\u2019d do ... but be conscious that we can\u2019t do everything on day one.\u201d It was a response to the paradox at the heart of Spain\u2019s new leftwing politics, which depends upon a small number of charismatic leaders. In Barcelona, for instance, the remarkable collective victory against the establishment by a crowdfunded citizens\u2019 platform, formed only 11 months before the election was built around the appeal of the one woman whose face was on all the posters In one of her most high-profile speeches of the election campaign, at a rally in September 2014, Colau addressed the grey areas in Spain\u2019s new populism. \u201cThey will ask us: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 Let\u2019s not be so arrogant as to say we\u2019re \u2018everyone\u2019. But we are the people on the street. We\u2019re normal people. We\u2019re simple people, who talk to our neighbours each day, who, unlike professional politicians, use public transport every day, work in precarious jobs every day, and who see how things are every day.\u201d Colau still lives in a modest flat near the Sagrada Familia with her husband Adri\u00e0 Alemany \u2013 with whom she wrote two books about the housing crisis \u2013 and her young son Lucas. With Gaud\u00ed\u2019s gargantuan basilica at its heart, and three million visitors a year filling the pavements of an otherwise quiet, residential neighbourhood, it is an area that exemplifies Barcelona\u2019s identity crisis. * * * As Colau has found out, the problem with being the people\u2019s champion, is that not all the people want the same things. In one part of Barcelona\u2019s old town, tensions over tourist excess have spilled over into outright hostility. Tucked away from the sea, Barceloneta\u2019s narrow streets are lined with blocks of flats displaying the barrio\u2019s blue and yellow flag, with a crest featuring a lighthouse and a boat. These days, they are often accompanied by another popular flag, bearing the stencilled Catalan slogan \u201cCap pis turistic\u201d (No tourist flats). For centuries, Barceloneta was a traditional working-class fishing district, until the beach on its perimeter underwent extensive regeneration for the 1992 Olympics. The area is now lined with expensive surf shops, rickshaw drivers, sellers of tourist tat and beach volleyballs. Locals complain that the cost of living has shot up and the hordes of tourists often make for bad neighbours. Tourist misbehaviour peaked in Barceloneta one Friday morning in August 2014, when three exuberant young Italian men spent several hours wandering around the area naked. Photographs of the streaking holidaymakers quickly circulated on social media and a series of anti-tourist protests followed. When I visited last year, the area was plastered with posters put up by the city hall, asking in several languages \u201cDo you know if you\u2019re in an illegal tourist apartment?\u2019 Another in the same series instructed: \u201cDon\u2019t use the street as a toilet.\u201d    As Colau has found out, the problem with being the people\u2019s champion, is that not all the people want the same things    Colau\u2019s stated priority is to move Barcelona away from what she considers \u201cmassified tourism\u201d, with no thought for sustainability, strategic planning or input from the public. \u201cUntil now, all we have had were private initiatives doing what they wanted,\u201d Colau told me. \u201cThis has led to a model that is out of control.\u201d She added: \u201cWe suffered the same short-sighted model here with the real estate bubble. We are trying to prevent the same mistakes happening again with tourism.\u201d Soon after her election, Colau announced a year-long moratorium on new hotels and tourist apartments, disrupting over 30 planned hotel projects. In March 2016, the city hall extended the ban, and is proposing to direct any future expansion to the periphery of the city, away from the over-burdened old town. City hall has also fined Airbnb and its rival Homeaway \u20ac60,000 each for advertising illegal tourist apartments \u2013 ones that had not been registered and were therefore not necessarily paying taxes or fees. In April, city hall announced it was looking into a specific tourist tax levied on those not making overnight stays: cruise ship passengers and day-trippers. Many of these initiatives have come from Ada Colau\u2019s new tourism council, which features input from ordinary Barcelonans, as well as the industry. Even so, many locals are still unhappy. On the first day of the Merce, as the crowds gathered in Pla\u00e7a Saint Jaume for Colau\u2019s ceremonial opening of the festival, the Barceloneta neighbourhood association staged a protest. The locals, many of them accompanied by young children, faced the city hall waving blue and yellow flags, banging drums and blowing whistles. \u201cLife in Barceloneta has become unbearable,\u201d Kico Casas bellowed to me above the din. He and his fellow activists are campaigning for a total abolition of tourist flats in Barcelona. \u201cSpeculation has led to so many rent rises,\u201d said Casas, \u201cand now we can\u2019t afford to live in the neighbourhood our grandparents lived in. Meanwhile, the drunken tourists and their parties make ordinary life unbearable.\u201d On a demonstration the previous week, the Barceloneta neighbourhood association had marched to the city\u2019s Airbnb offices, wheeling a cannon alongside them \u2013 a theatrical homage to the area\u2019s marine heritage \u2013 and fired a fake shot at the apartment rental company. On that occasion they had singled out Colau, too, with a homemade banner reading: \u201cMayor: three months without solutions. Well?\u201d It was the first time Colau\u2019s core supporters, or at least one strand of them, had faced up to their champion. On the other side of the old town from Barceloneta lies the Raval, another area with a long history of poverty and strident working-class solidarity. One afternoon, I attended a community discussion event here, which took place on ground where a factory once stood. The empty plot was due to have a luxury hotel built on it \u2013 instead, the site was occupied by local activist groups who had turned it into a \u201csocial space\u201d, covered in graffiti art decrying police brutality and city branding of the \u201cI <3 Barcelona\u201d variety. A man named Manel Aisa took the mic to explain that he grew up on this very street in the 1950s, where his dad ran a bar populated by duckers and divers, radicals and sex workers. He explained that the week before, he had been walking through the Raval, when a group of young German tourists approached him and asked in faltering Spanish, \u201cIs this a good area to invest in property?\u201d He managed a laugh, recalling the cheek of the question. \u201cI told them where to go \u2013 away.\u201d     Apartments in Barceloneta display banners protesting against tourist flats. Photograph: Dave Stelfox    But the difficult truth is that for many Barcelonans \u2013 not just a wealthy elite of cruise ship owners, hoteliers and landlords \u2013 the tourist economy has been a source of salvation. \u201cFor the majority of people sharing their home, it\u2019s about making ends meet,\u201d Ricardo Ramos, spokesman for the Barcelona Association of Neighbours and Hosts, explained over lunch near Sagrada Familia. \u201cWe have pensioners who are trying to pay the mortgage, or the rent, and live on \u20ac400 a month \u2013 and that\u2019s impossible in Barcelona. Some of these people would be on the streets within two months, without that extra income.\u201d Ramos\u2019s organisation, which was founded in April last year, is supported by Airbnb. Its members have organised their own protests \u2013 with slogans, written in English, such as \u201cTourists come home!\u201d , instead of \u201cTourists go home\u201d. Ramos explained that, as well as helping home sharers, the type of tourism encouraged by companies such as Airbnb generates income for small shops located outside the obvious tourist centres, and provides a more local and authentic experience than a fleeting walk around La Rambla and a night\u2019s sleep in an international hotel chain. Airbnb points to a 2014 study that found that more than half of the company\u2019s Barcelona hosts had used the platform to help pay their mortgage, rent or bills \u2013 in the process, generating \u20ac128m and creating more than 4,000 jobs in the previous year. Like his opponents in Barceloneta and the Raval, Ramos argued that if Colau were really of the people, she would be supporting them: \u201cGiven that Mayor Colau comes from a socialist background, I don\u2019t understand why empowering citizens to take action to avoid being evicted from their homes is so difficult to understand. We should be on the same side. Home sharing and tourism has been stigmatised in Barcelona \u2013 some groups of neighbours have been out on patrols, at night, to see where the tourist flats are. And Mayor Colau doesn\u2019t stop it.\u201d \u201cI think Mayor Colau doesn\u2019t understand the difference between being in an election campaign, and being in power,\u201d Ramos continued. \u201cWhen you are in the campaign, you talk to your audience, that\u2019s fine \u2013 but once you are in power, you rule for all citizens, regardless of whether they voted for you or not.\u201d * * * With a minority government of only 11 of 41 councillors, Colau and BCom\u00fa have required support from other parties to get new legislation passed. They have also faced hostility from the business community and media \u2013 not to mention an intransigent local bureaucracy. The threat that BCom\u00fa\u2019s enemies posed to stable governance was clear from the outset \u2013 even before the mayoral inauguration, Jean Delort, the political representative for the Barcelona police, resigned in protest at the election of Colau. \u201cFor them, there are no decent police,\u201d said one police spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re all torturers.\u201d BCom\u00fa has encountered substantial opposition in the council chamber from established parties keen to block its more radical reforms and expose its inexperience. In October, two parties which were nominally allied with BCom\u00fa \u2013 the centre-left PSC and the leftwing Catalan nationalists ERC \u2013 voted to reverse Colau\u2019s moratorium on new hotel building (it was renewed in March nonetheless). The following month, the PSC leader Jaume Collboni described the measures as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d, accusing Colau of ideological purism and \u201cprofound ignorance of the terrain\u201d in \u201ca complex city like Barcelona\u201d. He proposed that the novices in BCom\u00fa would benefit from his party\u2019s governing experience, and that only a co-governing pact with the PSC would stabilise the \u201cextreme weakness\u201d of Colau\u2019s administration. On 10 May, Colau finally relented, and announced just such a pact. BCom\u00fa will be bolstered by the PSC\u2019s four councillors, and Collboni will become deputy mayor. Perhaps more importantly than votes in the city council chamber, the PSC will give Colau\u2019s administration access to a network of contacts, which includes influential bureaucrats, union officials, commercial and civil society associations. As with any governing coalition, behind-the-scenes politicking and media spin will be vital in determining which party is judged to have been the \u201cwinner\u201d from the deal; in the short term, it is hard not to see it as a defeat for Colau. In January 2015, four months before the election, she had ruled out just such a pact with the PSC, whom she called one of the \u201cparties of the regime\u201d, and as such, \u201cpart of the problem, not the solution\u201d.     A stencil of Mayor Ada Colau in the Gracia neighbourhood of Barcelona. Photograph: Dave Stelfox    Some activists are sceptical about what this compromise will do to BCom\u00fa; according to an article published last week in the leftwing newspaper Diagonal, the PSC pact is \u201clike getting a dominatrix into bed, with the hope they will assume a submissive role\u201d. Events in Barcelona in the last few days risk further alienating some of Colau\u2019s core supporters. The eviction of squatters from a former bank that they had turned into a social centre led to violent clashes with riot police. She angered some people by refusing to get involved in what she said was a private dispute (although she has also offered to find the squatters an alternative site). These kinds of setbacks raise a bigger question for BCom\u00fa supporters and those of other new parties such as Podemos: was it all worth the effort? Might they just have been better off lobbying for change from outside their various parliaments? For some experienced observers, taking activist politics into the institutions of power was always going to be a challenge. Oriol Nel\u00b7lo is professor of urban geography at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, and a former PSC representative in the Catalan regional parliament. In last year\u2019s municipal election, he backed Barcelona en Com\u00fa. Grassroots activists should not think of city hall \u201cas a fortress\u201d, he told me over coffee in a cloistered square in the Raval. \u201cIt\u2019s better to think of it as a very complex arena, in which you can manage to conquer certain positions \u2013 knowing that these institutions are more likely, a lot of the time, to give way to other pressures, coming from the economic sector or from business. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do anything within the institutions,\u201d he smiled. \u201cYou can change plenty of things.\u201d For Nel\u00b7lo, Colau\u2019s determination to rebalance the effects of tourism in favour of Barcelona\u2019s citizens is one example of a reform that is both essential and achievable. In the summer of 2016, Spain\u2019s political scene is in a strange purgatory: the old is dying and the new cannot be born. The rise of new parties on the left and right culminated in an inconclusive general election in 2015, without a decisive victor. Six months of coalition talks resulted in stalemate, and so Spain will go to the polls again at the end of June; the results are likely to be equally unclear. In the meantime it is Ada Colau, and her fellow mayor in Madrid, Manuela Carmena, who remain the most powerful proponents of \u2018the new politics\u2019 in Spain \u2013 a country where, despite a short period of economic recovery, unemployment remains above 22%. Even after the compromise with the PSC, there is a sense among her supporters that Colau\u2019s experience fighting for housing reform, occupying banks and blocking evictions with the PAH has given her the confidence and perseverance to see the project through. It is, she told me, \u201ca collective made up of the poorest people in Spain, people who have lost everything \u2013 not just their homes, or their money, but their hopes for the future.\u201d With nothing left to lose, they got organised, formed close bonds, supported new friends, joined in civil disobedience together, fought and kept fighting \u2013 and they won. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience I will never forget in my entire life,\u201d Colau said, \u201cbecause it taught me the most valuable lesson I have ever learned, which is that we will be whatever we want to be. To have a society that is more just truly depends on us, and on whether we get involved or not.\u201d Main photograph by Dave Stelfox \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.  This article was amended on 26 May 2016. An earlier version stated that Ada Colau earned a degree in philosophy at the University of Barcelona. In fact she studied the subject but did not complete her degree. This article was amended on 27 May 2016. An earlier version stated that upon being elected Colau reduced her pay from \u20ac140,000 to \u20ac28,600. In fact, opposition parties voted to make Colau stick to a local finance law, that the mayor\u2019s salary would total at least \u20ac100,000. As a result, Colau has stated she will donate the remaining amount of her salary to local groups.",
