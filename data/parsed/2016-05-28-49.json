Professor Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, said such a move would be disruptive and completely unnecessary. In an open letter to the World Health Organisation (WHO), released on Friday, the group of academics said the Brazilian strain of Zika virus harmed health in ways that science had not observed before. \u201cAn unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic,\u201d they added. But Farrar, a specialist in tropical medicine, told the Observer yesterday that the risks did not warrant such a drastic course of action. \u201cThe numbers travelling to and from Brazil for the Games is likely to account for about 0.25% of world travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not pose a sufficient risk of spreading the disease in my view.\u201d Farrar added that if the Games were halted because of the threat of Zika, other major international events would also face calls for cancellation. These could include the Hajj, which sees around 2 million pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia every year. \u201cHalting that would be very difficult,\u201d Farrar said. Zika disease is caused by a virus that is spread by infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, rash and joint pain. Serious complications can arise for pregnant women, who can give birth to babies with abnormally small heads. For this reason, expectant mothers have already been advised not to travel to Rio. However, the signatories say the only effective measure for containing Zika is a to postpone the Games \u2013 a call that has been rejected by the WHO, which said yesterday that there was \u201cno public health justification\u201d for postponing the Rio Olympics because of Zika. This rejection has led the signatories of the open letter to attack the WHO for having too close a partnership with the International Olympic Committee and for being biased in its actions. The WHO went into official partnership with the IOC in 2010, in a deal that Professor Amir Attaran, one of the open letter\u2019s authors, described as \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is ignorant and arrogant for the WHO to march hand in hand with the IOC.\u201d Nevertheless, in the wake of the open letter, many scientists have rejected the signatories\u2019 call for the games to be postponed. Farrar said: \u201cMosquitoes in August are not nearly so active in Brazil as at other times of the year. Risks are therefore reduced.\u201d The answer to the Zika emergency was to provide education and advice \u2013 particularly about the dangers of the virus\u2019s sexual transmission \u2013 and to work to control its mosquito vector. His views were endorsed by Lancaster University biologist Derek Gatherer. Brazil was affected by many tropical diseases \u2013 including malaria and dengue \u2013 that were all clinically more serious than Zika, he said. \u201cBut none has been proposed as a reason to cancel the event.\u201d Pregnant women would be best advised to stay away, while people who do attend should use insect repellant and avoid risky sexual behaviour. \u201cIf these principles are observed, there is no reason why the Olympics cannot take place,\u201d Gatherer added. Virologist Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University agreed. \u201cGlobal travel and trade offer Zika an opportunity to spread. By comparison with these routine activities, the increased risk that the Olympics poses is a drop in the ocean.\u201d  This article was amended on 31 May 2016 to remove a mistaken reference to the signatories calling for the Games to cancelled. They call for \u201cthe Rio 2016 Games to be postponed and/or moved to another location \u2013 but not cancelled \u2013 in the name of public health.\u201d    Letter to the editor Professor Farrar of the Wellcome Trust reasons that there is not a substantial risk of Olympic travel in Brazil seeding new Zika infections in other tropical countries because \u201cThe numbers travelling to and from Brazil for the Games is likely to account for about 0.25% of world travel.\u201d That is unsound scientific reasoning, because it is not the percentage of travel that matters, but its destination. In a hypothetical world where even 100% of world travel was between Rio and London, there would be little risk because the mosquitoes native to the UK are not known to transmit the virus, making a mosquito-borne epidemic impossible. The outcome would be very different if the travel was into Lagos or Mumbai, where the mosquitoes are perfect and the potential victims of Zika in the urban slums are many.  Nor is Prof Farrar correct to believe that moving 500,000 international visitors into an epidemic zone is trifling, even assuming that it is just 0.25% of world travel. When in 2013 Brazil acquired its now infamous Zika epidemic, that was due to a single viral introduction event from French Polynesia. In 2013, Brazil received fewer than one traveller a day from Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), accounting for just 0.00017% of world travel using Prof. Farrar\u2019s assumptions. That slender thread of connection touched off Brazil\u2019s epidemic, and it makes 0.25% look plenty large in comparison.  The Olympics are unique among mass gatherings \u2013 unlike even the World Cup or the Hajj \u2013 because they create totally new threads of connection with literally every country in the world. This fact makes the Olympics incomparably efficient at potentially spreading epidemics which the host country has failed to quell.   When South Africa hosted the World Cup, it spent many years and used aggressive methods to push malaria to virtual elimination. Not so Rio and Zika, where in the early part of 2016, mosquito-borne disease has risen sharply over last year, including even in the exact neighbourhood of the Olympic Park (Barra da Tijuca). Until Rio gets its house in order, as South Africa did, the Olympics ought not to proceed.   Amir AttaranProfessor, Faculty of Law & Faculty of MedicineUniversity of OttawaCanada",
