  "body": "Danny Willett\u2019s journey to the position of Masters champion suggested he was never likely to rest on his laurels. The Yorkshireman proved as much at the K Club on Thursday, on his second competitive outing since donning the Green Jacket, with a first round of 65 to lead the Irish Open. When Willett said he wanted a tilt at world No1, the words were not hollow. Willett had played flawless golf in reaching the 17th tee in seven under par. He promptly dropped a shot, before recovering with a birdie on 18 in a style befitting his status. Rory McIlroy, who is second at minus five, will be among those aware of the scale of task in hand to overhaul Willett even with 54 holes to play. Willett came within one of the course record on the outskirts of Dublin.

This was his first sub-par Irish Open first round in four attempts. On a tough day with ever-changing weather Martin Kaymer, Callum Shinkwin, Shane Lowry, Ross Fisher, Paul Dunne and the defending champion, Soren Kjeldsen, are among a select group of players who posted under-par rounds. Kaymer\u2019s prominence is intriguing, with the former world No1 looking to recapture form and play himself back into the Ryder Cup equation after a curious spell in golf\u2019s wilderness. On one of the more newsworthy days of this \u2013 or any other \u2013 golfing season, events in Scotland were not far from the thoughts of competitors. Padraig Harrington, a two-times Open champion, was among those to congratulate the R&A for its swift response to Muirfield\u2019s refusal to admit female members. The course will not stage another Open. \u201cWhat harm would it do having a few lady members?\u201d asked Harrington after a disappointing opening round of 76. \u201cThere is no reason why it can\u2019t work, and in this day and age, who would want to be in a golf club with only men? The R&A has done the right thing for the bigger picture and the greater cause because they have that responsibility. This shows they are moving into the modern era, that they have more of a responsibility than just golf. \u201cObviously there is great history and heritage to Muirfield and the players love playing it. It\u2019s a great golf course and I can see why people would want to keep it [as an Open venue] but the reality is the R&A has a bigger responsibility outside of golf. \u201cIf you want to be a smaller club and not deal with the outside world, that\u2019s their [Muirfield\u2019s] business. But once you step into the general public and society \u2013 and especially a media world \u2013 then you have to make sure everything is fair to everybody.\u201d Paul Lawrie, the 1999 Open champion, insisted Muirfield\u2019s stance \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d. There was bad news for the European Tour as Justin Rose withdrew from next week\u2019s BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. The event, which will be played against the backdrop of a high-profile dispute between Wentworth\u2019s Chinese owners and local residents, was already missing McIlroy, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Henrik Stenson. \u201cI battled the onset of back pain all week at the Players Championship and symptoms worsened during my week after at home,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI have a great team of people around me who are working diligently to help me get as fit as possible, as soon as possible and I must fully focus on rehab at this time.\u201d Timing is key here; Rose will go in search of a second US Open title in mid-June. In the United States, Phil Mickelson was named \u2013 but not criminally charged \u2013 in an insider trading case. Mickelson has agreed to repay $1m. The five-times major winner\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cPhil understands and deeply respects the high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and of Phil himself. \u201cHe subscribes to the same values and regrets any appearance that, on this occasion, he fell short. He takes full responsibility for the decisions and associations that led him to becoming part of this investigation. He is pleased that this matter is over.\u201d",
