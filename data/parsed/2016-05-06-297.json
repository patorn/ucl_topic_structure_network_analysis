  "body": "1) Special day for Leicester players, even those denied full glory Spare a thought this week for Ritchie De Laet, who must feel a little like Michael Collins, the astronaut who accompanied Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Apollo 11 mission but had to stay in the shuttle while they pranced around the moon. Still, at least Collins got to go to space: De Laet went to Middlesbrough. Then again, if Boro beat or draw with Brighton on Saturday the Belgian will achieve promotion to the Premier League in the same season as he won it, which is a feat that demands respect even if he would no doubt have preferred to have continued playing for Leicester rather than depart on loan in February. De Laet joined Leicester from Manchester United back in 2012 on the same day as Matty James made the same move. James has not played this season due to a serious knee injury but there is a chance that he will be fit enough to feature against Everton \u2013 and what a heartening moment his reappearance would be, along with many others scheduled for the King Power on Saturday. PD  \u2022 Ranieri: \u2018Whoever arrives at Leicester must have the same spirit\u2019\u2022 Leicester to offer Mahrez new deal but \u201850/50 chance\u2019 he could leave\u2022 Huth and Fellaini banned for three matches over clash  2) Carroll eyes his favourite opponents        Striker Andy Carroll   Appearances 24  Goals 9  Shots 46  Shots on target 43%  Offsides 6     The last Saturday afternoon game at Upton Park \u2013 try to keep it together \u2013 and West Ham United still have hope of qualifying for the Champions League. Unbeaten in the league since losing to Southampton on 6 February, Slaven Bilic\u2019s side are desperately unlucky not to be in the top four already, given the long list of controversial refereeing decisions that went against them between 19 March and 9 April, but they will be guaranteed to finish fifth and so secure a place in the Europa League if they win their final three fixtures. The first of those is against Swansea City and Andy Carroll, who has scored six goals in his past seven matches, must be licking his lips. Carroll scored three goals in two matches against Swansea last season, laid on two assists for Kevin Nolan in a 2-0 win at Upton Park two years ago and headed a late winner past Gerhard Tremmel in 2013. JS  \u2022 West Ham offer \u00a331.5m for Marseille\u2019s Batshuayi but face competition            Farewell Boleyn: the end of an era for West Ham.    3) Newcastle fans eager to relieve their worries and mock Villa\u2019s  The big question here is: will Aston Villa players summon the spirit of Eden Hazard and shrug off a season of sloth and ineptitude to pull out a big performance when it no longer matters to anyone but their club\u2019s rivals? Because Villa and Newcastle are indeed bitter rivals, all because of a couple of banners displayed by Villa fans at the end of the 2008-09 season, back when Villa fans still at the heart to laugh at others\u2019 woes. And Newcastle were certainly woeful, as an own goal by Damien Duff gave Villa a 1-0 win and relegated Alan Shearer\u2019s Newcastle, causing wags in the Holte End to hold aloft bed linen decorated with with slogans such as: \u201cSob on the Tyne\u201d and \u201cWho will be your next messiah \u2013 Ant or Dec?\u201d Fast forward seven years and Villa fans would be better advised to use that linen to wipe up the ordure left on pitches by their players every week, while Newcastle, well, they\u2019re still in deep sheet \u2013 but they\u2019re improving. After a dispiriting start to his reign, Rafael Ben\u00edtez has found a formula that could save Newcastle \u2013 with key features being Jamaal Lascelles in central defence, Andros Townsend running free, and Jonjo Shelvey parked on the bench until he learns that the occasional Hollywood pass does not trump consistently sound decision-making. Win this and Newcastle fans will have real reason to cheer \u2013 and jeer. Lose it and the glumness at Villa Park will sink to new depths. PD  \u2022 Newcastle United release Obertan and Marveaux  4) Will Tottenham pick themselves up? Assessing Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s season is not easy. No one was talking about a title challenge when they began the campaign with three points from their first four matches but they have made vast progress under Mauricio Pochettino in an impressively short space of time and will surely go straight into the group stage in the Champions League next season given that they are six points clear of fourth-placed Manchester City with two games left. The future is bright. At the same time, however, it is hard not to feel that this was a missed opportunity. In the end, they could not hold their nerve in the biggest moments, perhaps because of their inexperience. They dropped two points against 10-man Arsenal and lost at West Ham in March and could not react after giving away leads against West Brom and Chelsea. They should feel immense pride; but the disappointment could linger. And if they are still feeling sorry for themselves on Sunday afternoon, Tottenham could lose to Southampton at White Hart Lane. Ronald Koeman\u2019s side have won five of their past seven matches to sustain their push for European football. JS  \u2022 Spurs close to deal with FA to play home games at Wembley in 2017-18\u2022 Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 charged with violent conduct for \u2018eye-gouging\u2019 Costa      Harry Kane cut a forlorn figure after Tottenham let a two-goal lead slip at Chelsea. Photograph: BPI/Rex/Shutterstock    5) Watmore could help Sunderland test Chelsea\u2019s staying power  Sam Allardyce has tended to introduce Duncan Watmore \u2013 whom he dubs \u201cThe Roadrunner\u201d \u2013 from the bench in recent weeks but it might be wise to start him against a Chelsea side who may still be reeling from the unfamiliar effects of being brutalised by Tottenham Hotspur and giving a high-energy performance this season for 90 whole minutes. Wahbi Khazri is an inventive player who delivers a nice setpiece and also possesses a potent long-range shot even if he has yet to show it regularly at Sunderland, but prolonged use of Watmore\u2019s speed and directness could be just what Allardyce\u2019s team need to end their streak of three home games without a goal and, in particular, help Jermain Defoe score his first goal at the Stadium of Light for four months. PD  \u2022 Chelsea defend \u00a390 cost of premium shirt for next season\u2022 Courtois: \u2018PSG is a very good club but I\u2019m happy at Chelsea\u2019  6) Welbeck a better bet than Giroud for Arsenal Olivier Giroud\u2019s solemn run of 15 league games without a goal should mean he loses his place to Danny Welbeck in Arsenal\u2019s starting lineup. Welbeck scored the winner three minutes after coming on against Norwich last weekend, a goal that means Arsenal should hang on to their precious top-four status, and his mobility, movement and link-up play will make them a threat on the break against Manchester City\u2019s porous defence. It might be time for Arsenal to cut their losses and sell Giroud in the summer. That would be a brave call by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. JS  \u2022 Why five English clubs could play in next season\u2019s Champions League      Danny Welbeck scored the winner against Norwich last weekend and Arsenal were much improved when he came on. Photograph: BPI/Rex/Shutterstock    7) Lack of transfer success leaves Norwich in trouble  Cameron Jerome struck the opener against Manchester United at Old Trafford in December but has not scored since \u2013 and no other forward has properly picked up the slack for Norwich, including Steve Naismith who was bought in January to do just that. So it is hard to foresee Alex Neil\u2019s team firing enough goals past David De Gea to boost their survival chances and torpedo United\u2019s hopes of overhauling Manchester City. With Timm Klose injured, Norwich\u2019s best line-up for this crucial game will look a lot like the side that went down two years ago. The squad, despite having a couple of nifty players, looks too limited to do what they failed to do before. Yet there is no denying their spirit, so if United under-perform, Norwich\u2019s could yet make a dash for safety. PD \u2022 Golden Goal: Mark Robins for Norwich City v Chelsea (1992)\u2022 Signs of life may come too late for Van Gaal 8) Palace players cannot afford to take it easy        Midfielder Yohan Cabaye   Appearances 32  Free Kicks 110  Corners 91  Crosses 58  Assists 1     Crystal Palace gave it a good go in their defeat to Newcastle last weekend and they would have taken a point but for Yohan Cabaye\u2019s squandered penalty. Their performance made a mockery of suggestions that they would be taking it easy with the FA Cup final coming up on 21 May \u2013 but now the challenge for Alan Pardew\u2019s players is to play with as much integrity in an otherwise meaningless fixture against Stoke City. Wembley places will be won or lost in the next two weeks. JS  \u2022 Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha an injury doubt for FA Cup final  9) Bournemouth\u2019s achievement and questioning Albion\u2019s Bournemouth\u2019s last home game of the season should be a righteously jubilant affair, as fans can bask in their team\u2019s triumphant campaign. Despite being afflicted by potentially ruinous injuries, Eddie Howe\u2019s side not only stayed in the Premier League but enhanced it with skill, spirit and a lovable sense of adventure. Tony Pulis\u2019 side stayed in the Premier League too but, given the gruel they\u2019ve served for most of the campaign, even Albion fans must wonder whether that is really cause for celebration. PD  \u2022 West Brom second in the Premier League\u2019s ineptness index  10) A chance for Watford to complete rare double Watford have never been able to savour a league double over Liverpool. Yet they walloped them at Vicarage Road in December and Liverpool could be vulnerable at Anfield on Sunday if they are worn out by their Europa League exertions against Villarreal. After a dreadful run of form culminated in their defeat by Palace at Wembley, Watford restored some belief by sneaking a late win over Villa last week and, though they seemingly have nothing left to play for, another victory might revive Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s hopes of keeping his job.
