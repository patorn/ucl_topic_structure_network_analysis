  "body": "A Colorado family has sued a marijuana dispensary alleging that an \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d cannabis-infused candy was responsible for the murder of their loved one in a wrongful death suit that experts say may be the first of its kind since legal weed arrived in the US. The three sons of Kristine Kirk \u2013 who was killed by her husband Richard Kirk in 2014 \u2013 filed a lawsuit against Nutritional Elements, a Denver dispensary, claiming that the business sold the man a \u201cKarma Kandy Orange Ginger\u201d that failed to adequately warn users about the risks of psychosis and paranoia and led him to suffer hallucinations before he fatally shot his wife. \u201cKirk\u2019s delusional behavior on the night of the shooting was aberrant, violent and not like anything Kristine had ever observed during her and Richard\u2019s longstanding relationship and marriage,\u201d according to the suit, filed in district court on Monday. \u201cThe packaging and labeling further failed to apprise the consumer of the product\u2019s known side-effects, which \u2026 include hallucinations, paranoia, and psychosis, all of which Kristine reported to the 911 operator she had observed in her husband shortly before he murdered her.\u201d  The suit also names Gaia\u2019s Garden, a company that manufactured the edible. Since Colorado approved recreational marijuana in 2012, there have been ongoing debates about labeling requirements and the safety of edibles, which can be far more potent than marijuana plants. Researchers recently found that marijuana-related emergency department visits by tourists in Colorado have doubled since legalization \u2013 which experts hypothesized could be due to the fact that out-of-state residents lack experience with edibles.  On 14 April, 2014, Richard, now 49 and facing first-degree murder charges, started hallucinating and \u201ctalking about the end of the world\u201d \u2013 telling his wife \u201che wanted her to shoot him\u201d, according to police records. After he shot his wife \u2013 audio of which was recorded on a 911 call, during which she raised concerns about marijuana \u2013 the father asked one of his sons to kill him, the complaint says. The children were aged 13, 11 and 7 when the shooting happened at their home. Their legal guardians \u2013 Wayne and Marti Kohnke, their grandparents, and Tamara Heman, their aunt \u2013 filed the suit on behalf of the three boys, which seeks damages and claims that the edible probably caused the father to experience a \u201cstate of anxiety and/or panic\u201d.

The packaging had no directions or recommendations for consumption and had no instructions for how consumers should respond \u201cin the event of an overdose\u201d, the suit says.  David Olivas and Gregory Gold, lawyers for the family, said in a statement that the suit was aimed at encouraging safety reforms in the marijuana industry: \u201cThis lawsuit will seek justice and change in an edible industry that is growing so fast it failed these young kids. Edibles themselves are not the evil, it is the failure to warn, the failure to properly dose, the failure to tell the consumer how to safely use edibles, that is the evil.\u201d Reached by phone on Wednesday, Tiffany Goldman, representative of Nutritional Elements, declined to comment. Gaia\u2019s Garden did not respond to a request for comment.",
