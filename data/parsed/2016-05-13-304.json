  "body": "Have you lost a bit of self-belief, confidence at work perhaps? Let\u2019s hope you watched new US import Billions (Sky Atlantic) then. I did, and I picked up a few things. So if anyone reading this online is maybe thinking of leaving a nasty comment below the line (it\u2019s a subject close to the Guardian\u2019s heart at the moment), you know what, I\u2019m not even listening. Or reading. No sir, I\u2019m listening to the voice inside telling me where the alpha is. It\u2019s the voice that got me here, and it\u2019s still there. What\u2019s it saying? That I\u2019m awesome. (I\u2019m now standing up and beating my chest with my fist, awesomely). And to anyone who says that I\u2019m not, do you know what it\u2019s saying? \u201cFuck you\u201d, that\u2019s what it\u2019s saying. That\u2019s the advice psychiatrist Wendy Rhoades (Maggie Siff) gives a guy whose mojo \u2013 and results \u2013 are a little down at the hedge fund where she works as performance coach. (Must have a word with the boss here about getting one of them, hopefully exactly like Wendy, who is seriously impressive.) Wendy\u2019s boss is Bobby \u201cAxe\u201d Axelrod (Damian Lewis, again very convincingly American), who not only started off with nothing but also survived the 9/11 attacks and rose from the ashes of the World Trade Center to become Master of the Universe, King of the Hedge Fund. He\u2019s the Mike Tyson in his prime of hedge fund managers. Is he dodgy? Of course he bloody is. And it\u2019s down to US attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti) to go get him. So there\u2019s a bad guy, and a good guy after him, right? But it\u2019s not quite that simple. Axe is also a man of the people. He puts the kids of his colleagues who didn\u2019t survive the 9/11 attacks through college. He gives money \u2013 loads of it \u2013 to the New York City Firefighters Foundation. He bails out the pizza place he used to go to as a kid which has hit on hard times. He loves that pizza place, and the pizza guy, and the pizza. And the people love Axe. Nailing a folk hero isn\u2019t easy. But then Axe goes and snaps up a heritage beachfront mansion for $83m (as he says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having fuck-you money if you never say fuck you?\u201d) and that opens a chink in his armour. Chuck is an alpha plus male too \u2013 determined, ruthless, all that. But he\u2019s also grumpy, short-tempered and complicated. Definitely complicated in the bedroom \u2026 actually, I don\u2019t think it is the bedroom; he\u2019s lying on a hard wooden floor, bound and gagged in an arresting opening scene that leaves your mouth wide open (before you close it again, quickly). A woman puts a high boot heel on him. \u201cYou\u2019re in need of correction aren\u2019t you?\u201d she purrs, before sticking the business end of her lit cigarette (in a Cruella de Vil holder) into his chest. Tssss! Ouch! \u201cThat\u2019s going to burn, let me fix it,\u201d she says, straddling him, squatting a little, and urinating. Oh! I thought it was jellyfish stings you did that for? Or is it sea urchins? But that\u2019s medicinal, rather than recreational ... Anyway, she\u2019s his wife, it turns out \u2013 Wendy Rhoades, Doctor Mojo, remember, at Axe\u2019s hedge fund, where she earns her husband\u2019s salary times eight. Dominatrix \u2013 and dominant \u2013 missus works for the enemy; that makes things tricky, and interesting. I don\u2019t think Billions says an awful lot about gender politics, to be honest. What\u2019s Axe\u2019s motivation? \u201cBeing a billionaire, when you walk into a room, it\u2019s like being a woman with a perfect set of tits,\u201d he tells Wendy. \u201cYou know exactly what everyone\u2019s looking at, and you know exactly what they want.\u201d Nor do I think I\u2019m learning a lot about Wall Street post 9/11, or real-world insider trading. It\u2019s really just about a couple of egotistical macho men called Axe and Chuck going head to head in a shower of gold (literally in Chuck\u2019s case) and $100 bills. Hell it\u2019s fun though, even if I feel ever so slightly naughty \u2013 guilty even \u2013 for enjoying it so much. Like getting off on Mixed Martial Arts (I\u2019m guessing). Plus I\u2019m inspired, of course. Not just to listen to my inner-awesome. But looking at the way Axe and Mrs Axe (also hard as nails) bring up their two boys, I realise we\u2019re doing it wrong in our non-beachfront house. I need to be pitting our boys against each more, to stoke their competitiveness. Also teaching them skills and strategies, like mercy is a word wimps use when they can\u2019t take the pain. And it doesn\u2019t matter looking foolish short-term if it means winning long-term. That\u2019s the aim: winning, long-term, big-time. Billions.",
