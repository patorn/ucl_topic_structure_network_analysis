  "body": "Technology is no longer one of life\u2019s benign helpers. I blame the Microsoft paperclip. He started it, with his incessant questions. Now we have an activity app on the Apple Watch that tells users to stand up if it thinks they have been sitting down for too long. Worse still is the proposed wearable tech invented by a British firm that could send bank customers an electric shock if they overspend. While the latter sounds like a story from the Onion, (and wouldn\u2019t you just take the watch off when you felt a bit spendy?), let\u2019s consider for a moment some uses such irritating warnings may have: 1. Buying obscure \u2018wellness\u2019 ingredients Please, I beg you, stop me when I enter a healthfood shop and reach for the organic seaweed kombucha. Don\u2019t open my kitchen cupboard: a packet of goji berries will fall on your head. I bought a jar of bee pollen last week. I have no idea why. And also, I feel bad \u2013 don\u2019t the bees need it? 2. Arguing on social media Are you trying to explain feminism to an egg? Log off Twitter and go to bed. Arguing with a stranger in the comments of a Z-list celebrity\u2019s Instagram? Throw your phone out of the window. A quick zap will remind you to question all your life choices leading up until this moment and move on. 3. Switching energy suppliers A cheaper gas or electricity tariff is available? No. No, it\u2019s not. Please don\u2019t ever do this. I did, and it\u2019s one of my top 10 all-time regrets for the hassle involved. You need an electric shock to stop you doing this, not to remind you to do this. *Disclaimer: cheaper gas and electricity tariffs are available. 4. Updating your operating system  You definitely need an electric shock if you ever find yourself considering this. It\u2019s a lie. Your system will not run more efficiently \u2013 it will delete all the pictures of your cat and BBC iPlayer will never work properly again. 5. Saying yes to things A short sharp shock every time you say \u201cI\u2019d love to \u2026 \u201d would be fantastically useful. Would you really love to go and see a five-hour Bavarian opera in a disused slaughterhouse just off the A12? Probably not. Do you really fancy going on holiday to a one-bedroom cottage in Wales with your in-laws? Unlikely. 6. Buying clothes that don\u2019t really fit Well sure, the size 12 fits, but isn\u2019t it just a little too big? 7. Opening brown envelopes  An excruciating zap every time an envelope from HMRC languishes underneath a pile of old newspapers and pizza leaflets for more than 24 hours is just the incentive you need to complete your tax return. Or maybe that\u2019s just me. 8. Saying: \u2018Oh, you know, the usual \u2026 do what you want, really\u2019 in the hairdressers Last time I had a hair cut without paying due care and attention my boyfriend didn\u2019t recognise me when I came out. 9. Cancelling your Amazon Prime free trial Beyond useful. Look, you\u2019ve watched The Man in the High Castle, you\u2019ve had your Nutribullet delivered. Give it up, and do it quickly. 10. Watching daytime TV No good will ever come of this. And no, the Jeremy Kyle Show is not educational. 11. Using smug hashtags  #amwriting \u2013 no you\u2019re not, you\u2019re #ontwitter. 12. And seriously \u2026 voting in the EU referendum You really should, you know. And three things it shouldn\u2019t ...  1. Texting your ex Did you think this would be in the previous list? Wrong. After all, what would a night on the razz be if you didn\u2019t wake up with a massive hangover and an inexplicable and illiterate series of texts on your phone? That hideous sinking feeling is simply part of life\u2019s rich emotional tapestry. 2. Reaching for that fourth chocolate Hobnob/ opening that third bottle of wine Life\u2019s short, so enjoy yourself. And if I got an electric shock every time I opened the fridge or reached for the corkscrew, I would smash that watch with a hammer faster that you could say \u201cMake mine a double\u201d. 3. Self-pleasure Devices that stop masturbation were very popular with Victorians, those top-hatted party poopers. But in a fantastic plot twist, prototype wearable technology now enables users to actually charge electronic devices through masturbation. Just don\u2019t try this in public.",
