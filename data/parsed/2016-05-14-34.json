  "body": "The Arsenal Ladies manager, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa, praised the hard work of the match-winner, Danielle Carter, and the leadership of the \u201cphenomenal\u201d Kelly Smith, but believes his team\u2019s success was mostly due to their ability to make things uncomfortable for Chelsea. Losa had instructed his side to press Chelsea high up the pitch and deny last year\u2019s double winners any considerable spells of possession. It worked to near perfection. \u201cThis is a dream come true,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very proud and I hope the fans can feel very proud. \u201cWe wanted to press them high from the beginning and that plan was working. We knew it would be difficult on a big pitch for that to last all game, but we did it. \u201cThe girls were fantastic and they gave everything on the pitch. It was not just about scoring, it was about the feeling of not making the opponents comfortable at any moment.\u201d   Related: Arsenal\u2019s Danielle Carter sinks Chelsea in Women\u2019s FA Cup final    Of Carter, Losa added: \u201cShe is always impacting on games, but she has been working hard to improve her finishing.\u201d His counterpart, Emma Hayes, was gracious in defeat, and is confident her team will learn from it. \u201cThe players will look hard at the game and be\u00a0disappointed,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cBut we will\u00a0bounce back. I\u2019m pretty certain I have a group that will find solutions. It\u2019s my job\u00a0to bring the best out of them after a big\u00a0setback. \u201cEvery time we play a game it\u2019s everybody else\u2019s cup final. Everybody wants to beat us because we are a top team.\u201d",
