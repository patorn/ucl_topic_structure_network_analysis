  "body": "To the news of the day: happy 49th birthday, Bill Shorten! Asked what he was getting, he said: \u201cMy present is standing right next to me\u201d, gesturing to his wife, Chloe. Aww/eww \u2013 delete as necessary. No word on whether Malcolm Turnbull being named in the Panama Papers counts as a gift.    Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone. It was great to be able to spend the day with @chloeshorten pic.twitter.com/T18bYvGaIr\u2014 Bill Shorten (@billshortenmp) May 12, 2016    On Thursday it was revealed that Turnbull was previously listed as the director of a British Virgin Islands company that Mossack Fonseca acted as registered agent for. Asked if he was \u201chappy\u201d to be named in the Panama Papers, he reportedly chuckled, then said there was \u201cno suggestion of impropriety whatsoever\u201d. Cool as a cucumber. Labor\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Penny Wong, is pushing for \u201ca full and frank explanation of his involvement\u201d. But the treasurer, Scott Morrison, felt Turnbull had dealt with the Panama papers \u201cfairly comprehensively\u201d, saying the matter was \u201c20 years ago\u201d.  \u201cThe thing about Malcolm Turnbull is ... he has had a lot of experience in supporting businesses not unlike this one,\u201d he said, then transitioned nearly seamlessly to spin about the Liberals\u2019 national economic plan. That\u2019s what you call being on-message. Even setting aside from being caught up in one of the biggest leaks in journalistic history, Turnbull\u2019s had a big day, kicking off with a 30-minute phone call to the president of the United States, Barack Obama (about \u201ca range of global and regional issues\u201d, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership), and taking in Melbourne and Adelaide and Sydney. Shorten, meanwhile, was still kicking around up north in Rockhampton, \u201cthe beef capital of Australia\u201d. What a way to ring in the big 49! Today he pledged that $1.8bn of the $3.8bn already allocated to additional needs-based funding for schools would be put towards those in regional areas. Given that the federal government doesn\u2019t actually run schools, there were questions over how this and Labor\u2019s other education policies would work in practice. His education spokeswoman, Kate Ellis, said the funding would be put towards programs with a track record of results and there would be \u201caccountability mechanisms ... We are being very clear that taxpayers deserve to know how every dollar is being spent.\u201d The ghost of PMs past lingers The Daily Tele\u2019s new BFF, Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese, wrote today that the Greens candidate for Grayndler has a Tony Abbott agenda. Creative! Jim Casey reportedly said in 2014 that he would rather Abbott be prime minister than Bill Shorten, leading DJ Albo to suggest that \u201cfor Mr Casey, protest has become an end in itself\u201d. He expanded on his theme at Marrickville public school: \u201c[Casey\u2019s] view appears to be to be a rather old-fashioned, extreme view that if people are oppressed enough they\u2019ll rise up \u2026 I entered political [life] to uplift people, that\u2019s what drives me each and every day.\u201d Casey published a response on Guardian Australia, thanking the Tele for the opportunity to debate the end of capitalism. We look forward to this rivalry playing out, hopefully in more media outlets. After he was invoked at Fiona Scott\u2019s stand-up with Turnbull on Wednesday, that makes two mentions of Tone in as many days. The man himself was out campaigning alongside fellow backbencher George Christensen in Queensland after a mixed couple of days on the north shore, being \u201cmobbed by adoring fans\u201d in Mosman one moment and cutting \u201ca forlorn figure\u201d at Manly wharf the next.    Fantastic photos from today of very popular Tony Abbott surrounded by locals!From https://t.co/tKnPplWJ3T #auspol pic.twitter.com/W79Pye7hTE\u2014 Nick No To PC Bullys (@nickbarnesaus) May 11, 2016    Abbott appears to have changed his tune on the matter of concessions on superannuation, which not so long ago he wasn\u2019t a fan of. \u201cThere is a degree of anxiety about that particular budget announcement but people are just as anxious about Labor\u2019s policy as they are about the Coalition\u2019s policy,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph today. That\u2019s that, then! No Dunkley country for young men    PM Turnbull tours a brewery in Morningron @murpharoo @GuardianAus #politicslive pic.twitter.com/wBjbbTADHZ\u2014 Mikearoo (@mpbowers) May 12, 2016    Turnbull\u2019s whirlwind tour of Victoria led him to Mornington brewery this morning. As Katharine Murphy wrote, it\u2019s early in the campaign to be driven to drink \u2013 especially the longest campaign since the 1970s. Bruce Billson was front and centre at the stand-up, despite, er \u2013 retiring. \u201cYou have to feel sorry for the Liberal candidate for Dunkley, Chris Crewther,\u201d wrote Melissa Davey in the live blog. He blended into the background as Billson stole the show, greeting reporters with hugs and exclaiming: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason every season to be in Dunkley.\u201d That\u2019s literally four reasons to be in Dunkley. Billson, 50, has held the seat in outer metropolitan Melbourne since 1996 but some reports say his popularity is worth a couple of per cent alone, and Labor hopes his retirement will be enough for them to steal the seat he took by 5.6% last time. Hence Billson was rolled out for Turnbull\u2019s visit, promoting the government\u2019s free trade agreement with China and the importance of supporting small businesses. Is 32-year-old Crewther worried that without the Billson factor the electorate will be hard to hold? \u201cHe\u2019s been a spectacular candidate for the past 20 years in Dunkley and a strong community advocate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope to do the same.\u201d Meanwhile, Billson didn\u2019t know \u201cwhich hoppy beer would be the best parallel to the election campaign\u201d but he did say that re-electing the Turnbull government would be \u201ca first-class result \u2013 a bit like these beers\u201d. Turnbull was comparatively restrained, saying that he was merely \u201cinspired\u201d by craft beer. (Note: \u201cby\u201d, not \u201cafter\u201d \u2013 though he clarified that his preference was for lager.) Best of Bowers     Bruce Billson gets ready to steal the limelight before Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s visit to the federal seat of Dunkley. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian    Further reading \u2022 The weak case for a company tax cut (the Age) Serious economic modelling underpins Turnbull\u2019s campaign \u2013 but his plan to cut company tax might not have been completely thought through, writes Peter Martin. \u2022 ANU modelling shows how the 2016 budget really affects your hip pocket (the Age) Modelling by the Australian National University shows Australia\u2019s poorest families will be hardest hit when the budget is implemented. \u2022 The superannuation changes are seriously good. The Coalition must fight for them \u201cThe Coalition should pull their socks up. And Labor should be ashamed.\u201d Fighting words from Guardian Australia\u2019s Gareth Hutchens. And also ... Modelling hailed by the Liberal party as proof its Direct Action plan could meet Australia\u2019s long-term climate promises in fact assumes the Coalition would turn its policy into a type of emissions trading scheme, according to the authors. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, released the modelling, by the Energetics consulting firm, just days before the election was called and said it was proof that critics of the government\u2019s policy were totally wrong. But Peter Holt, associate at Energetics, told Lenore Taylor that the policies would only achieve those reductions with changes \u2013 either large funding top-ups to the ERF (estimated by others at at least $6bn) or a strengthening of the safeguards mechanism so it turned into a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ...     The listing of the weapon that killed Trayvon Martin on GunBroker.com included photos of the weapon taken during George Zimmerman\u2019s trial. Photograph: www.gunbroker.com    George Zimmerman is auctioning off the gun with which he killed Trayvon Martin in 2012, touting it as \u201cyour opportunity to own a piece of American history\u201d. He intends to use part of the proceeds to \u201cfight BLM [Black Lives Matter] violence against law enforcement officers\u201d as well as ending the career of Angela Corey, his prosecutor \u2013 \u201cand Hillary Clinton\u2019s anti-firearm rhetoric\u201d. And if today was a pop song ... Could\u2019ve gone for any number of birthday tunes but, since we\u2019re running a little bit hot tonight: Van Halen\u2019s Panama is the song of the day. Happy birthday, Billsy.         Can barely see the road from the heat coming off of it.
