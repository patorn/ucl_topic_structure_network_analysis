They are as mainstream as rival DC\u2019s Preacher, which Alonso edited and is now a Seth Rogen-produced TV show on AMC, and as offbeat as Jeff Lemire\u2019s indie classic Essex County. He punctuates his sentences with \u201cYou follow me?\u201d and he\u2019s so conversant with the intricacies of his business that it\u2019s often a reasonable question. He\u2019s certainly been leading Marvel in a new direction. Alonso is responsible for Marvel Comics now offering a broader array of comics than it ever has before. The San Francisco native, who began his working life as a journalist for the New York Daily News, has run Marvel comics for just under five and a half years and over the course of his tenure he\u2019s radically changed the Marvel landscape, ridding the company of the last vestiges of a house style \u2013 the well-liked, offbeat Unbeatable Squirrel Girl looks nothing like The Extraordinary X-Men \u2013 and expanding the company\u2019s roster of characters and creators to include more women and people of color. Last year the company made about $224m off sales of comics and trade paperbacks through comic book shops alone; they also sold the most popular comic in that market in 22 years: Star Wars #1, which shipped nearly 1.1m copies, according to industry researcher John Jackson Miller.

Alonso\u2019s Marvel looks very different: one of two Spider-Men is a biracial kid named Miles Morales, Thor is a white woman, one of the Captains America is a black man, Ms Marvel is Pakistani American and the Hulk is Korean American. All this happened with comparatively minimal backlash from notoriously tetchy readers, because Alonso and the company\u2019s writing and editing teams have made changes carefully, switching costumes among established characters and stacking the deck with popular creators when the possibility of fan rage \u2013 which is always at least ambient \u2013 seems likely. Marvel has intra-company crossovers about twice a year; when Civil War II launches, its lineup of superheroes will look much, much different than they did in even last year\u2019s Secret Wars. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy job and Axel has a very rare mix of not only recognizing talent but knowing what talent is capable of,\u201d said Heidi MacDonald, a former DC Comics editor who worked alongside Alonso at DC Comics\u2019 adult-focused Vertigo imprint. \u201cHe\u2019s not a warm, fuzzy, cuddly guy, but he is a good one.\u201d It would probably be even more accurate to call Alonso an iconoclast, an oddly necessary quality in a manager charged with keeping so many elderly characters from getting dusty. He was one of the company\u2019s top editors when Marvel decided it would stop submitting its product to the Comics Code Authority, a board of censors that enforced largely arbitrary standards around violent or sexual content, adopting an in-house ratings system instead. He also helped found Max, an imprint specializing in harder-edged takes on the company\u2019s superheroes to which the current crop of gritty Netflix shows such as Jessica Jones and Daredevil owe much, and where Alias, the original Jessica Jones comic, was first published. With Alonso helming the ship, Marvel has recently adopted a try-anything aesthetic that keeps paying dividends, both in story terms \u2013 the white Captain America is now an agent of rightwing group Hydra \u2013 and in terms of a broadening ethnic and gender diversity in its ranks, both fictionally and professionally.      Black Panther became an instant bestseller. Photograph: Marvel    As the company changes, its iconography grows more powerful: beyond making bestseller lists, Ms Marvel has taken on symbolic value outside her own adventures, with fans pasting cutouts of the character over anti-Muslim bus ads in San Francisco.  This isn\u2019t just a form of altruism. Disney (which bought Marvel in 2009) has excellent business reasons for pursuing a more diverse marketplace. Since the company acquired Marvel, it has given the publisher access to the vast reams of focus-group and test-market data that Disney employs elsewhere in its operations, MacDonald said. In mainstream superhero comics, a minority readership has always been present, if often underserved. Now it makes financial sense for companies to cash in. \u201cThere\u2019s money to be made and that\u2019s why Disney does it,\u201d said MacDonald. \u201cIt\u2019s always the right thing to do, to create comics that look more like the real world, but it\u2019s definitely backed up in that way.\u201d The market for comics has shrunk, especially factoring in the decline of major bookstore chains, but Marvel has maintained its share and it has done so while steadily increasing the prices of its books, especially reprint editions. People are willing to pay for \u201ccomics that look more like the real world\u201d, explains MacDonald. Among Marvel\u2019s current offerings: Howard the Duck, an offbeat humor comic written by Canadian author Chip Zdarsky, previously known almost exclusively as an artist; The Silver Surfer, a kid-friendly adventure in which Mike Allred\u2019s artwork pops like a Lichtenstein painting; Hellcat, by Kate Leth and Brittney L Williams, looks at home next to issues of Archie and Jughead. There\u2019s also the instant bestseller Black Panther written by Atlantic writer and MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d grant fellow Ta-Nehisi Coates for artist Brian Stelfreeze, which is like reading a blockbuster action movie.

The company approached Coates about writing for Marvel on the advice of editor Sana Amanat.  \u201cWe met and she suggested it and I said I was a huge Spider-man fan as a kid, but they already had plans there,\u201d Coates says. \u201cAnd then they said they needed a new Black Panther writer and I was like \u2018Ohh!\u2019 I don\u2019t know, how can you be closed to that? I had to figure something out in terms of what the arc would be and everything, constructed some beats as to how it would look.\u201d Coates said that he\u2019s always seen comics as a more diverse medium than other pop culture. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend much money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to be diverse. You don\u2019t have to ask, \u2018Can this person carry a film?\u2019\u201d There\u2019s definitely a greater freedom to experiment within comics, which have become in many ways the research and development division for serial visual media from movie franchises to TV series. But Disney\u2019s influence has changed Marvel and some of the changes take some getting used to: it seems unlikely the upcoming Tsum Tsum comic book is the result of an editorial brainstorming session. \u201cMarvel has definitely become a more secretive place,\u201d said MacDonald. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to find out things from casual conversations on the street like I used to.\u201d That is the game, and Alonso is good at it. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be where he is if he didn\u2019t understand that this was a world of gigantic brand synergy,\u201d she said. But Alonso has a personal stake in the changes, too. \u201cTraditionally [writing] comics has been a hobby for white guys, and that has changed over time,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cI\u2019m Hispanic and I never dreamed of having a career in comics; I started in journalism and sort of segued into this field.\u201d He\u2019s visibly pleased about Coates\u2019s book in particular. \u201cWith Black Panther we\u2019re going to have our cake and eat it, too,\u201d he said.
