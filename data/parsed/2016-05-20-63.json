  "body": "The BBC has been in the publishing business, either on paper or online, for its entire 93-year history (Is it really the BBC\u2019s role to publish free recipes for harissa spiced lamb?, 20 May). Why are the Tories suddenly intimidated by this? I thought that capitalism welcomed competition? As a licence payer I am happy for the BBC to continue to publish material related to its broadcasts.Alan WrightWorthing, Sussex \u2022 Penny Feldon (Letters, 18 May) misses the point regarding the scrapping of the BBC recipe site. The recipes have already been paid for through the licence fee, and providing access to the data through the website is done at negligible cost. I buy and borrow recipe books and also use the site in preference to any other. There is nothing inherently virtuous about using a book. The concern that many share is that this is another example of where the government is seeking to limit the remit and reach of public institutions.Mark HebertNeedingworth, Cambridgeshire \u2022 A former Nato general sees a real risk of war with Russia within a year. Do you think the Russians would mind waiting until our aircraft carriers are ready?Brian GilbertHampton, Middlesex \u2022 Maureen Evershed (Letters, 19 May) says the basic income policy \u201cis presented as some bright new progressive gem, with never a mention of its green origins\u201d. While I acknowledge the Green party as one of the most consistent proponents of the basic income policy, in Thomas More\u2019s Utopia (1516), Raphael suggests a basic income as an alternative to sentencing thieves to death.Ted WatsonBrighton \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff doesn\u2019t mention how other drivers will treat driverless cars (Driverless cars may well be smart, but they won\u2019t be fun, 20 May). A bit of aggression at a junction or priority passing point \u2013 and which car is going to give way? It\u2019s not going to be the driven vehicle as the software on the driverless car should have to take the safety option. Getting driverless cars to give way, brake or swerve will soon be part of the \u201cfun\u201d driving experience.Gary BennettExeter \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
