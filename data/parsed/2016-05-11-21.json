Less than 1% of people who could benefit are getting surgery and the numbers are dropping not rising, according to bariatric surgeons writing in the British Medical Journal, who say that the UK is lagging behind other countries in Europe. Severely overweight people have often been dieting, losing and regaining weight for years, say experts, stuck in a cycle that leaves them feeling ashamed and to blame. The diets do not work for many of them, but surgery does. People who have stomach shrinking operations lose an average 25-35% of their body weight \u2013 usually at least 15kg \u2013 in a year, compared with an average 7% with diets and weight loss drugs. The surgeons say there are about 2.6 million obese people in the UK who could benefit from surgery, which would hugely improve their health and save the NHS money over the long-term. A quarter of adults in the UK are obese \u2013 the second highest rate in Europe, say Richard Welbourn and colleagues \u2013 citing OECD figures which put Hungary just edging into first place. Yet between 2011-12 and 2014-15, the number of operations fell by 31%, from 8,794 to 6,032. The UK is 13th out of 17 EU countries in terms of the amount of bariatric surgery it offers. If all the 1.4 million most severely obese Britons went under the knife, at a cost of \u00a36,000 an operation, it would cost the health service \u00a38.4bn, which is almost exactly the extra amount the government has earmarked for the NHS by 2021. In an interview with the Guardian, NHS England\u2019s chief executive, Simon Stevens indicated he would prefer to \u201cget upstream and turn off the tap in terms of cost\u201d. Welbourn, a consultant at Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton, Somerset and colleagues, argue that more surgery would save the NHS money in the long term as obesity-related conditions such as heart disease and cancers are reduced. They say there is evidence that 65% of patients with type 2, obesity-related diabetes come off their medication after surgery. The savings in the drugs bill alone would recoup the costs of surgery in three years, they write. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has recommended that surgery should be considered for people with severe obesity who have tried all other means to lose weight without success. They have to be committed to changing their lifestyles and eating habits so they can adapt to the very restricted diet they will be able to eat for the rest of their lives. The surgeons calculate that 2.6 million people in the UK would meet these criteria. But the long process they have to go through, which is a four-tier process beginning with the GP and involving lifestyle education and attempts to control their weight through diet and exercise, is a barrier, say Welbourn and colleagues. They say stigma is also a problem and want bariatric surgery to be renamed. \u201cAdopting the phrase \u2018metabolic surgery\u2019 might enable society and patients to talk about it and begin to establish a culture change,\u201d they write. The National Obesity Forum said that many more patients should be offered the chance of surgery. \u201cThe NHS\u2019s reluctance to provide funding for this surgery is a mind-blowingly false economy,\u201d said its spokesman Tam Fry. \u201cIt is officially acknowledged that what we know as \u2018simple\u2019 obesity may well bring the health service to its knees: not to operate to prevent even more expensive diseases triggered by obesity [diabetes Type 2, cardiovascular diseases and cancers] escalating will likely hasten the NHS\u2019 demise.\u201d Professor Jonathan Valabhji, NHS England\u2019s National Clinical Director for Obesity and Diabetes, said: \u201cObesity is a significant and wide scale public health issue for all age groups and an issue the NHS as a whole is dedicated to tackling. The costs to the NHS of managing the diseases associated with obesity are huge so we need to invest in both people who are already overweight as well as educating the generations to come in the importance of avoiding becoming overweight or obese. \u201cBariatric surgery is a highly specialised procedure and should only be considered for selected patients with severe and complex obesity where the full range of other weight management approaches have been tried, with expert support, but have not been successful.\u201d",
