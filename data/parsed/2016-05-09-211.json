However Lieven Maesschalck, the Belgium team doctor, claims the 30-year-old could still play on for five more years if he recovers fully. Kompany suffered the problem in the opening minutes of City\u2019s 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u last Wednesday. The central defender is ruled out of Belgium\u2019s Euro 2016 campaign, which starts in June, and now is set to be unavailable for Guardiola when the 2016-17 season starts.

His troubled history and the length he will be out may threaten his long-term future at the club. According to Maesschalck, Kompany may not return until the end of August. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Kompany [last] Thursday. It was very clear: he has a complete tear of the slender thigh muscle,\u201d he told the country\u2019s Radio 1. \u201cIt will take about four months to get match fit again. How bad it is, Vincent must now look forward to next season. It was inevitable, he had no choice. The decision is final. \u201cKompany was obviously very disappointed. For him, everything [is] Belgium. He wanted to do everything to be there at the European Championships. The body of Kompany is under enormous pressure, the time pressure is always there and he is very demanding of himself. On the other hand, it is phenomenal how he deals with the disillusionment. He draws all courage for the next chapter. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back. Now he has the opportunity to rest and recover his body well.\u201d Maesschalck is clear Kompany can still look forward to many more years playing at the highest level. \u201cI\u2019m 100% sure he can handle it effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cKompany sets himself always in a positive way. It is a privilege to work with such a personality. Vincent has been playing 16 years at the top level. [Marc] Wilmots [national coach] has also often been injured and always returned to the highest level. \u201cIn the NBA, I have seen the same thing many times. This does not mean the end of the career of Kompany. He needs only one match to get back at the top level. A winner if he can handle it. And he still can compete at the highest level for at least five years.\u201d",
