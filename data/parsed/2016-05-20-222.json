  "body": "\u201cI\u2019d prefer the wording not to focus on environmental damage\u201d \u2013 those were the words used in an email by the company Shell, as it attempted to muscle in on the Science Museum\u2019s curatorial decision making. In 2014, Shell had been a sponsor of the museum\u2019s climate science exhibition but once that controversial email had been unearthed \u2013 as the result of a freedom of information request \u2013 there was no going back. The museum\u2019s reputation was damaged and the end of Shell\u2019s sponsorship became inevitable.  Earlier this month, the campaign group, Art Not Oil, published a damning report into the \u201ccorrupting influence\u201d of another fossil fuel giant \u2013 BP \u2013 on the museums and galleries it sponsors. Once again, it places the Science Museum in the spotlight.  At its recent AGM, BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley insisted that the company gives money with \u201cno strings attached\u201d but documents cited in the report paint the opposite picture. Rather than furthering the understanding of science, BP appears to have been using the Science Museum in order to sharpen its spin and advance its strategic interests with policymakers. Curatorial independence is highly prized in the culture sector but for the Science Museum, BP has often been an exception to the rule. When the museum redeveloped its energy gallery in 2004, BP played a \u201chands-on\u201d role. An article posted on BP\u2019s website at the time (but now no longer available) described a \u201cBP advisory board headed by Peter Mather, BP head of country, UK\u201d with \u201c10 experts from BP \u2026 to help with content for the exhibits.\u201d And the Science Museum\u2019s sponsorship liaison manager said: \u201cWe would like to help [BP] meet their objectives on different levels, including corporate responsibility, education strategy and global strategy.\u201d In the intervening 12 years \u2013 despite BP\u2019s failure to go \u201cbeyond petroleum\u201d as the company once promised \u2013 the Science Museum has continued to bend to the company\u2019s demands. It was the sponsor of the museum\u2019s recent Cosmonauts exhibition where it was Bob Dudley and not the museum who personally invited John Whittingdale, secretary of state for culture, media and sport, to the launch dinner. One email showed BP trying to shift the exhibition launch date away from days when \u201cyou\u2019d struggle to engage senior officials\u201d in Russia and away from times when BP\u2019s \u201csenior Russia team\u201d would not be in the country. BP currently has a 19.75% stake in the Russian state-owned oil and gas company, Rosneft. And when the Science Museum\u2019s director, Ian Blatchford, subsequently received the Pushkin medal for the Cosmonauts exhibition from Vladimir Putin, the company gained sponsorship recognition at the very top. The museum also continues to help BP with its \u201ceducation strategy\u201d. It currently partners with the museum on the Ultimate STEM challenge, a competition for key stage 3 children that this year saw students asked to design \u2013 with no hint of irony \u2013 \u201ca more efficient oil tanker\u201d. In 2004, BP\u2019s head of future fuels described young people as the \u201cenergy consumers who will use and choose which energy to use in the future\u201d. It gave the new Energy gallery the whiff of a PR-venture and the Ultimate STEM challenge looks no different. These ethical questions around BP\u2019s influence over the Science Museum form part of a wider debate about how research is carried out and communicated. Earlier this year, over 100 leading researchers called on the American Geophysical Union (AGU) to drop Exxon as a sponsor, following revelations that it misled the public about the risks of climate change. Despite the outcry, the AGU defended Exxon and kept them on board. Other fossil fuel links to research institutions include UCL\u2019s BHP Billiton Institute for Sustainable Resources and the Shell professor of earth sciences at Oxford. These companies are buying a sheen of objectivity and legitimacy by associating their brands with top research bodies \u2013 and this in turn helps to shore up their political influence. The Museums Association recently launched a new Code of Ethics which makes it clear that museums should \u201csupport free speech and freedom of expression\u201d. But when it comes to BP, the Science Museum has been only too willing to sideline freedom of expression in order to protect the interests of its sponsor. Public trust in scientific research and its communication must come first, and in light of the evidence we\u2019ve assembled, the museum should now end its relationship with BP. Visitors to the Science Museum deserve more than a showroom for \u201cBP-branded science\u201d \u2013 something that is already well past its use-by date.
