  "body": "War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength.  1984 is a dystopian novella by George Orwell published in 1949, which follows the life of Winston Smith, a low ranking member of \u2018the Party\u2019, who is frustrated by the omnipresent eyes of the party, and its ominous ruler Big Brother.  \u2018Big Brother\u2019 controls every aspect of people\u2019s lives. It has invented the language \u2018Newspeak\u2019 in an attempt to completely eliminate political rebellion; created \u2018Throughtcrimes\u2019 to stop people even thinking of things considered rebellious. The party controls what people read, speak, say and do with the threat that if they disobey, they will be sent to the dreaded Room 101 as a looming punishment. Orwell effectively explores the themes of mass media control, government surveillance, totalitarianism and how a dictator can manipulate and control history, thoughts, and lives in such a way that no one can escape it.       The protagonist, Winston Smith, begins a subtle rebellion against the party by keeping a diary of his secret thoughts, which is a deadly thoughtcrime. With his lover Julia, he begins a foreordained fight for freedom and justice, in a world where no one else appears to see, or dislike, the oppression the protagonist opposes. Perhaps the most powerful, effective and frightening notion of 1984 is that the complete control of an entire nation under a totalitarian state is perfectly possible. If the world fell under the control of one or even multiple dictators, the future could easily become a twisted, cruel world where every movement, word and breath is scrutinised by an omnipotent, omnipresent power that no one can stop, or even oppose without the fear of death.
