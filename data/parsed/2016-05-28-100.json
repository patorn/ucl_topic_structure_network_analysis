  "body": "It is still probably a good idea in the minds of the coaches. And presumably they will be telling their players that if they, the privileged to be wearing the shirt, don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, then their careers are definitely not going to be extended much beyond this afternoon. So, in all in all, England-Wales can\u2019t be such a bad idea. It is, after all, a series decider, what with the teams level on one victory apiece over the course of the season. Wales won in the World Cup at Twickenham and England won there in the Six Nations on their way to the grand slam. What\u2019s wrong with acclimatising the sides to the notion of a showdown? They\u2019ll both be off to the southern hemisphere soon enough for three-match series, and what wouldn\u2019t they both give to be in contention after two Tests? One-all with one to play; get used to the feeling \u2013 think big, England and Wales.   Related: England\u2019s Eddie Jones warns Australia to expect an \u2018enormous scrap\u2019    It was still a good idea when England knew they would be without their Saracens and Exeter players. Unavailability is an everyday reality, and at the end of any campaign teams have to be able to absorb the loss of any number of players and keep their spirits up, their shape intact and their set-plays memorised. So, get out there and play. How shall they play? England have a little bit of the throwback about them, with Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury reunited in the second row. The rise of Maro Itoje and George Kruis in Eddie Jones\u2019s first chapter with England helped underline not only the new coach\u2019s daring in selection but also the role of the lock as a sexy place to play. Sure, they have to be big, but they have to be athletic and even silky, especially while going for the ball dropping out of the sky. On the Wales side, Luke Charteris will be missed. He is not exactly the silkiest, being half a metre too long of back and limb to be anything more elegant than an invader from the War of the Worlds, but he stretches his arms to remarkable effect. His tackle count led the way in Europe and he is a most intelligent infiltrator of mauls. Jake Ball, who comes in for the Racing 92 player still involved in the regular season of the Top 14 \u2013 that is, they haven\u2019t even started the play-offs \u2013 is a different sort of lock, more dynamic off the mark, but not as telescopic as Charteris. That leaves Alun Wyn Jones, a stalwart of the Wales pack in the age of Warren Gatland. He has been recovering from a heel injury, and his nation has been pleased to see him take time out. If ever a player has flogged himself season in, season out for region and country, it has been AWJ. The problem now for a 32-year old with 98 caps to his name is that the world catches up, and it will take a ferocious determination to reimpose himself on a game that has grown accustomed to the sight of Kruis and Itoje dominating individually and as a duo. On the other hand, it has never dared to be suggested that AWJ lacks devotion to the cause. His comeback will be \u2026 interesting. The second rows deserve top billing because they may well have more of a say on Sunday than players in daintier positions. Wales, encouraged by their coach to be a little less cautious, are trying to push up the tempo, in readiness for the fields of New Zealand, but it has been difficult for them to abandon the style that the very same coach imposed on them when he arrived in 2008.

It\u2019s just time to update it, and Wales are not entirely comfortable when egged on to be more elastic. Even in their concluding and resounding 67-14 dispatch of Italy in the last game of the Six Nations, there were times in the first half when their passing made their coaches wince. There is no guarantee, after a break from international intensity, that they will be fluid from the off. The second rows may have a heavy load if the ball does not go accurately to other quarters. England, too, may take time to settle. It\u2019s a reason to play this game \u2013 wire-brush the rust off the rhythms here at Twickenham in order to hit the ground running and passing in Australia and New Zealand, go one-nil up and take the series to a decider. It\u2019s a sound theory. It\u2019s just that the sun is shining (sort of) and the second Test of the cricket summer is under way and the French Open is here and somehow it doesn\u2019t feel quite right, even if it serves to settle a series that has never been short of drama, to have England-Wales at Twickenham.",
