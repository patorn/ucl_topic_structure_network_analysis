The legislation extends the amount of time a terrorism suspect can be held for questioning from 24 hours \u2013 in practice, up to eight days including \u201cdead time\u201d \u2013 to two weeks. A suspect will not need to be brought before a judge until the fourth day of questioning under the legislation, which the state premier, Mike Baird, said on Wednesday was about doing \u201ceverything possible to protect our community from terrorist threats\u201d. \u201cThese new powers do exactly that, by giving our police the ability to properly investigate terrorist plots,\u201d he said. Similar powers already existed in the form of preventative detention orders, which allowed state police to detain a suspect for up to 14 days, but they could not be questioned.

Keiran Hardy, a lecturer in criminology at Griffith University, said allowing police to question as well as detain a suspect for up to two weeks was \u201cquite a significant bypassing of the traditional arrest and questioning model\u201d. He said the ban on questioning suspects under preventative detention orders was considered a trade-off for the long confinement permitted by the orders, introduced in 2005 as an emergency means of preventing a terrorist attack. \u201cNow this has become an investigative power,\u201d he said. The deputy premier and justice minister, Troy Grant, said the laws \u2013 modelled on similar British legislation \u2013 would \u201conly be utilised when there is imminent threat to our community from terrorism\u201d. \u201cAll the appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure these laws are not misused,\u201d he said. \u201cThe terrorist threat has become more fast-moving and unpredictable and we need to have the powers to respond quickly and effectively.\u201d   Related: Revealed: How I saw Farhad Jabar change a week before he became a killer    Grant said the laws may have helped authorities prevent the murder of police accountant Curtis Cheng, who was shot dead outside Parramatta police headquarters in October.  The bill also establishes a \u201cmechanism to protect sensitive criminal intelligence relied upon by police to make detention applications\u201d, according to a statement. The precise details of the mechanism are unclear as the text of the bill is yet to be published. The NSW laws are likely to be adopted by other states in line with an in-principle agreement at the latest Council of Australian Governments meeting.",
