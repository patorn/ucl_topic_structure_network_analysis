  "body": "\u2022 An editorial about the forthcoming EU referendum said Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage were \u201cchugging around Britain\u201d in their bright red Vote Leave campaign battlebus. Farage is not part of\u00a0the Vote Leave campaign; he is touring the UK in Ukip\u2019s deep purple battlebus (This campaign must show more respect for both facts and voters, 28 May, page 34). \u2022 The caption with a photograph on the letters page (17 May, page 28), which showed a tiny woman walking between rows of large chairs, should have made clear that the photograph had been digitally manipulated. There was no intention to mislead on the part of the photographer. \u2022 A feature about the rapper Stormzy (Taking the world by storm, 21 May, page 8, The Guide) said: \u201cOne month he\u2019ll be giving a talk at the Oxford union; the next hanging out in Ayia Napa with a guy who\u2019s got \u2018Stormzy\u2019 tattooed on his bum.\u201d We got the location of the tattoo-related incident correct, but the talk by Stormzy that the article referred to was at the Oxford Guild Business Society, not at the Oxford Union.",
