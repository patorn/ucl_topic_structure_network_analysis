  "body": "These two new books on\u00a0Augustine of Hippo, the towering figure of\u00a0late-antique Latin theology, could not be more different, but that will hardly come as a surprise. Robin Lane Fox is an ancient historian who once wrote a book (The Unauthorised Version, 1991) announcing his own atheism and his intention to expose the historical contradictions underlying the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. Rowan Williams retired as archbishop of Canterbury in 2012 \u2013 while in the role he repeatedly defended the rights of the religious to resist secularism. Lane Fox writes with a historian\u2019s gift for exposing the strangeness of a different culture; Williams immerses himself in\u00a0the theological subtleties of one of antiquity\u2019s most ambitious thinkers. Williams\u2019s book, a collection of revised articles (and one sermon) written for different audiences, has all the trappings of academia: sophisticated, challenging prose, German titles in the\u00a0footnotes, sometimes even untranslated Latin (not all of it, I am bound to say as a classicist, reproduced perfectly). But for all that, it is less a critical study than an attempt to enlist the ancient writer as an ally for the modern theologian. For Williams, Augustine matters as the thinker who elevated doubt, questioning and self-consciousness \u2013 gathered up in the idea of \u201cconfessions\u201d, which became the title of his most famous work \u2013 to a spiritual state. The underlying message is that if we, in our secular world, feel paralysed by the moral complexity around us, that should lead us not to postmodern relativism and ennui, but to acknowledging that our own limitations and weaknesses are what make us human, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 that true knowledge and wisdom are dependent on our philosophical acceptance of God within the community of Christian believers. Indeed, Williams borrows throughout from the postmodern lexicon, with a particular fondness for metaphors drawn from language and literature. Existence is a narrative. The soul is a\u00a0sign (even if, as he says, Augustine \u201cdoes not quite put it like that\u201d). The world is a \u201ctrace\u201d (a Derridean term) of\u00a0its maker. Evil has a grammar. Even God has a place in a linguistic system, as pure being, irreducible to the sign. But when he writes that \u201cthere is no finality, no \u2018closure\u2019, no settled or intrinsic meaning in the world we inhabit\u201d, Williams is not conceding the\u00a0postmodern point but countering it; for of course the meaning that shapes our lives is, in his view, precisely not of this world, and it is only once we have come to accept that indeterminacy is what defines us as humans that we can begin to accept Christ\u2019s testimony to that deeper truth. If Williams gets Augustine as an ally, Augustine in return gets Williams as an advocate, a robust defence counsel in the face of the accusations levelled at him since the 20th century. Williams has no time for ecocritics who would blame Augustine for enshrining a dualist worldview that downgrades nature and the sexualised body in favour of a masculine principle of creation. He dismisses \u201cthe standard feminist charges\u201d against him (blaming Eve and so forth). Those who see him as anticipating Descartes\u2019 sense of the self as solitary and reflective miss his emphasis on the relationship with God and the Christian community. And as for those who blame him for \u201cmuddles about sexuality\u201d, Williams\u2019s attitude is that, well, there are more important things to talk about. (Perhaps there are signs here of his weariness with the issue of Anglican homophobia, which he could not resolve as archbishop.) The complicity between Williams and his subject makes this book a frustrating read for the secular-minded. He has no interest in exploring those aspects of Augustine that might not match modern tastes, whether the ethical delinquencies of his views on slavery and women or the complex blend of non-Christian forces that helped shape him (there is little in here on Cicero or neoplatonism, for example, and nothing on Manichaeism, the religion he followed until his conversion in his late 30s). The Augustine that emerges is, rather, a 21st-century, liberal, cerebral Anglican. In fact, it is sometimes hard even to tell who is speaking, Augustine or Williams, given the latter\u2019s fondness for \u201cparaphrasing Augustine quite freely\u201d (Williams\u2019s own words). When we read, for example, that \u201cGod\u2019s active love is what draws us across the distance between creator and creature\u201d, it\u00a0is unclear whether this is offered as an authentic rendering of Augustine\u2019s thought, as Williams\u2019s supplementation of it, or even as an authoritative pronouncement about the truth of existence. All three at once, perhaps. I suspect Williams would gently reflect that this kind of finickiting about historical difference misses the point. The truth he urges us to embrace is not anchored to particular moments in human time. In fact, according to Augustine-Williams, our awareness of the illusory nature of time is \u2013 along with sin and embodiedness \u2013 part of the limitation that we have to accept to be good Christians. Only once we have contemplated and embraced our own incompleteness can we be \u201ctransformed into a moment in the history of Christ\u201d. This is the position from which Augustine himself concluded (in Williams\u2019s paraphrase) that \u201cthe Psalms are the words of Jesus, the Word who speaks in all scripture\u201d, even though they were composed perhaps as much as a\u00a0millennium before Jesus\u2019s birth, in a different language and an unimaginably different context. To those who see religion not as truth but as part of the human fabric of history, however, such claims are hard to swallow. Lane Fox is, as one would expect, much more sedulously historical: Augustine interests him partly as a captivating personality, but more as a\u00a0witness to his age, both to the social realities of life in Roman north Africa and to the religious revolutions of the late fourth century AD, the era that saw\u00a0the faith that had tentatively been adopted by the Emperor Constantine embedded as the primary state religion of the Roman empire. His is a biography not of Augustine himself (the benchmark is still Peter Brown\u2019s Augustine of\u00a0Hippo, 1967), but of the Confessions. Whereas Williams proceeds by a series of deep soundings, Lane Fox\u2019s precise prose clarifies, streamlines and contextualises, taking us chronologically from Augustine\u2019s birth to his conversion. Along the way, the specifics of Augustine\u2019s own experiences are revealed through comparison with and\u00a0contrast to two other approximate contemporaries for whom there is plenty of evidence, the brilliant pagan orator Libanius and the charismatic Libyan bishop Synesius. Lane Fox richly paints the quirky, colourful, bizarre life of a provincial, middle class, Latin-speaking north African, whose first allegiance had been to the dualist \u201ctrue Christianity\u201d of Mani (\u201cthe only world religion\u201d, we learn, \u201cto have believed in the redemptive power of farts\u201d), and who came to Rome as an outsider, reliant primarily on his native talents. Unlike Williams, Lane Fox has no aversion to the corporeal: he revels in Augustine\u2019s \u201cfornications\u201d, his reflections on the male orgasm, ancient forms of birth control, the moment when he dared \u201cto lust\u201d and \u201cprocure the fruits of death\u201d within a church (a\u00a0hook-up, Lane Fox argues, not an act of masturbation), the sex-mad priests who deserve to be defrocked, his eventual embrace of Paul\u2019s association of sin with the sexualised body. There are, indeed, rather more references to breasts in this book than one might have expected. But for all that Lane Fox is probably the least Augustinian reader of Augustine imaginable, he is nevertheless sympathetic to his subject\u2019s theological preoccupations, carefully unpacking what was at stake in his conversion and preaching, and his\u00a0handling of the schism with the Donatists. This is how ancient texts should be discussed: with brio, panache, erudition and intuition, but also with sensitivity to the challenges posed by alien cultural frameworks. \u2022 Tim Whitmarsh\u2019s Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World is published by Faber.
