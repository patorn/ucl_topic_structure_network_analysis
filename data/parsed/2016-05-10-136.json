  "body": "Originally scheduled to appear in time for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, the long-delayed Pel\u00e9: Birth of a Legend \u2013 the first ever biopic of the soccer legend \u2013 is finally being released. Co-directed by American brothers Jeff and Michael Zimbalist, and executive produced by Pel\u00e9 himself, the film unfolds like a superhero origin story crossed with a sporty riff on Slumdog Millionaire.    Related: 40 years on: how New York Cosmos lured Pel\u00e9 to a football wasteland    Its first half charts 10-year-old Pel\u00e9\u2019s hardscrabble existence alongside friends and family in the slums of S\u00e3o Paulo state; its second focuses on his rapid rise to prominence with the Brazil soccer squad, culminating in his team\u2019s victory at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, when Pel\u00e9 was just 17. (Pel\u00e9 scored twice in a 5-2 win over the Swedes, here clumsily portrayed as a swaggering battalion of Aryan Terminators.) Curiously, despite the film\u2019s Brazilian setting, all its characters are fluent in English. This is presumably a ploy to enable the film to reach the widest possible audience, but it never stops being jarring. The weirdness factor only intensifies when Vincent D\u2019Onofrio, the burly American star of Netflix\u2019s Daredevil, pops up to portray Brazil\u2019s under-pressure coach Vicente Feola. The actor\u2019s Brazilian accent frequently strays, volubly and hilariously, into Al Pacino-in-Scarface territory.           Carlos Alberto\u2019s classic World Cup goal for Brazil: brick-by-brick video animation    Though the film is overly simplistic and often hackneyed (one might easily lose count of the number of sun-kissed training montages set to twinkly music), it\u2019s rarely dull, and there are some interesting revelations. We discover, for example, that Pel\u00e9 (born Edison Arantes do Nascimento), received his nickname from a rival child footballer and initially loathed it. The film-makers also deserve credit for addressing racism and classism in Brazilian society, and how these issues manifested themselves in heated debates over the efficacy of Brazil\u2019s joyful, \u201cprimitive\u201d style of soccer. Proceedings are further elevated by charismatic performances from the two young actors playing Pel\u00e9 (first Leonardo Lima Carvalho, followed by Kevin de Paula), and the stirring presence of Brazilian superstar Seu Jorge (City of God) as Pel\u00e9\u2019s taciturn, yet warm father.

Perhaps the film might\u2019ve been improved by a more substantial appearance from Brazil\u2019s record goalscorer. After all, as the following examples show, Pel\u00e9 has a surprisingly prolific record in front of the cameras. Pel\u00e9, the actor While still playing professionally for his club side Santos in Brazil, Pel\u00e9 racked up an impressive list of acting credits. In 1969, he played an alien named Pl\u00ednio Pompeu in The Strangers, a sci-fi TV show designed to drum up national interest in the Apollo moon landings. Two years later, he appeared briefly in the ribald, Benny Hill-esque sex comedy O Bar\u00e3o Otelo no Barato dos Bilh\u00f5es, projecting stately authority as a suave doctor who comes to the financial aid of the film\u2019s main character, a diminutive would-be playboy. Pel\u00e9\u2019s most interesting early role, however, came in Osvaldo Sampaio\u2019s period drama A Marcha (1970), which was set in the final years of Brazilian slavery . Pel\u00e9 played the abolitionist Chico Bondade, a Scarlet Pimpernel-type freedman who infiltrated plantations to free slaves.      Sylvester Stallone and Pel\u00e9 on the set of Escape to Victory.

In his 1998 autobiography, Pel\u00e9 wrote: \u201cI especially liked [this film], and collaborated on the story for it. It was about the problem of abandoned children; a subject I cannot repeat often enough is close to my heart. I hoped the film would help get them off the streets, make something useful of them, for them and for society.\u201d (Pel\u00e9 also found time to contribute vocals to a couple of songs on the soundtrack of a 1977 documentary about him: he\u2019s no Gilberto Gil, but his vocal stylings boast a certain calming trill.) In 1981, Pel\u00e9 gave his highest-profile film performance to date, as Corporal Luis Fernandez in John Huston\u2019s POW adventure Escape to Victory. Pel\u00e9\u2019s involvement arose from a spin-off from his contract with Warner Communications, who owned the Warner Bros studio. Of working on the film, Pel\u00e9\u2019 wrote: \u201cI\u2019d come onto the pitch with the same passion that I had brought to real games \u2026 Huston used to shout, \u2018Pele, relax! It\u2019s a film, it has to be contained within the scene, the emotion has to be controlled \u2026\u2019 He was a cinematic genius.\u201d He also threw some shade on co-star Sylvester Stallone: \u201cI learned too that the \u2018stars\u2019 don\u2019t always work democratically. Stallone, for example, wouldn\u2019t let anyone else sit in his chair on the set.\u201d In the Brazilian crime thriller Pedro Mico (1985), Pel\u00e9, as the titular Rio trickster, showed off some capoeira skills \u2013 and an impressively bushy moustache \u2013 in what would be his only lead role. After Pedro Mico, however, Pel\u00e9 settled into a groove of appearing as himself in fictional films: a testament to both his star power, and his gift for self-marketing. He re-teamed with John Huston for the syrupy orphanage fable A Minor Miracle (1983), grew a beard for and wept in 1987\u2019s terminally cheesy soccer drama Hotshot; and, some years later, had a brief, funny turn in Britcom Mike Bassett: England Manager (2001). There are enough hints in Pedro Mico to suggest that Pel\u00e9 could have had a more substantial acting career. But it seems, understandably, he decided that being the world\u2019s greatest soccer player was more than enough.
