  "body": "For once the weather forecasters were wrong about bad news. The entire staff of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, all the passionate amateur astronomers of the Flamsteed Society, and many anxious members of the public, spent the weekend obsessively refreshing the Met Office weather forecast app \u2013 but the threat never changed, the skies over London would have 100% cloud cover, and the best chance of observing the transit of Mercury before 2049 would be lost. When the Observatory\u2019s many clocks struck noon, and the skies overhead were still an improbable Mediterranean blue, the elation was tangible.           Mercury passes in front of the sun \u2013 video    \u201cEvery time we have a big event over London, we expect the weather to turn on us,\u201d astronomer Tom Kerss said. High over his head, light too dazzling to look at was pouring through the slot in the dome through which the Great Equatorial Telescope peered, trained on the sun after almost a century of looking at the moon and stars. The telescope, one of the largest in the world when it was built in 1893, been fitted with a filter the size of a bin lid for the occasion. \u201cWithout it,\u201d Kerss said, with a certain grim satisfaction, \u201canyone looking through it straight at the sun would have their retina burned out and go permanently blind \u2013 straight away. We have been warning and warning people against looking at the sun through telescopes.\u201d \u201cWow! I can see it clear as day \u2013 that\u2019s Mercury! It\u2019s happening!\u201d said Roman Gerasimon, who up to that point had been calmly explaining the hard science of the phenomenon to a group of schoolchildren, but was now losing it as a jet black dot appeared on the blood red disc of the sun in the eyepiece of his telescope. The filters gave the transit a truly prog-rock colour scheme, missed by Edmund Halley, when he first observed it in 1677. A steady trickle of planet watchers had been making their way up the steep slopes of the hill for hours. Hardened by long freezing nights waiting for clouds to part to reveal even a single star, they were easily distinguished from the frivolously dressed dog walkers and joggers: they had hats and water bottles, thermos flasks and jumpers tied around their waists. Many were clanking with kit, even though the observatory had supplied an array of devices for the public, from startlingly effective French-made cardboard box viewers, to staff astronomer Greg Smye-Rumsby\u2019s own precious Questar telescope: \u201cthe Rolls Royce of telescopes\u201d, he said, that \u201cgoes with me everywhere.\u201d   Related: Transit of Mercury \u2013 in pictures    By 1pm the black dot was visibly moving across the blazing face of the sun, visible in the cardboard box, on tablets linked to cameras and telescopes, and streamed live from the eye of the Great Equatorial. Detachment was abandoned by scientists and visitors alike, movingly aware that they were comrades under the sky with millions of others across the world and centuries of observers before them. \u201cYou are witnessing the poetry of the heavens in motion,\u201d astronomer Marek Kukula said, \u201cas a rock the size of Africa flies past the sun.\u201d Similar scenes played out around the world, or at least in those countries where the transit occurred in day time. Telescopes erected at the Birla Planetarium in Chennai, India, displayed Mercury on a screen, from which passersby snapped pictures of the alien world in motion. In Germany, amateur astronomers peered up at the spectacle through telescopes set up in the grounds of the Bergedorf observatory in Hamburg.

Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, said that while surface temperatures on the solar system\u2019s innermost planet reach more than 400C, craters that pock the planet\u2019s north pole provide some respite from the heat, with regions that are permanently in shadow. \u201cWe believe there is water and other volatiles in these permanently shadowed craters,\u201d he said. From its vantage point far above Earth, the US space agency\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory watched Mercury make first contact at the edge of the sun and then work its way steadily across the dazzling yellow disc until it emerged on the other side.

The long threatened cloud cover began to roll across the brilliant heavens. The inside of the magical cardboard box viewer just looked like a cardboard box again. People began to drift away. \u201cAh well,\u201d Kukula said. \u201cIt was glorious while it lasted.\u201d",
