  "body": "Perhaps the most disturbing part of Holy Hell \u2013 the documentary which premiered at Sundance earlier this year and is about a West Hollywood cult \u2013 is that life in the group doesn\u2019t look that bad at all. Beautiful young people dance around in pastoral scenes, while an aviator-wearing leader expands their minds by seemingly doing little more than having a very good time. Holy Hell director Will Allen joined the Buddhafield in the 80s. His film \u2013 made up of videos he shot while in the group \u2013 raises accusations that over two decades he, and other members of the group, were sexually abused by the cult leader, who now goes by the name of Andreas but was also known as Michel. Former group members claim he controlled intimate elements of their personal lives and there were petty tyrannies as well; Andreas had trained for the ballet, and put his followers through grueling practices to stage elaborate ballets that no one but the group would ever see.

Instead, the first half-hour of the film makes the cult look welcoming, appealing \u2013 even holy. \u201cThe community turned out to be the thing that bonded us together and kept us there for so long,\u201d Allen told me in a phone interview. He joined the Buddhafield at the urging of his sister, when he was 22, shortly after finishing film school and coming out as gay. \u201cI felt very confused and unsure of everything, and I had no one to explain everything to me.\u201d  \u201cThe community provided this immediate sense of unconditional love. Nobody judged each other; we were there with open arms loving everybody as individuals. That wasn\u2019t something I had found in college, and I hadn\u2019t found that in my family either.\u201d          Holy Hell    That love wasn\u2019t a delusion; the documentary shows Allen is still close with many of the people from the community, and they obviously still care about each other. Similarly, Allen isn\u2019t ready to just dismiss the spiritual experiences he and others had while with the Buddhafield. The documentary shows Andreas leading many of the members to profound feelings of oneness with God, complete with psychedelic-like visions, and a blissful sense of well-being. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing drugs, we weren\u2019t escaping through alcohol,\u201d Allen told me, \u201cso we were escaping through this more metaphysical relationship with ourselves.\u201d     This happens in corporations, this happens in religions, this happens all over the world.  Will Allen     But eventually the community and friendship began to feel like a trap. Allen alleges that Andreas encouraged his followers to \u201cKeep holy company\u201d, by which he meant that they should avoid interactions with those outside the group. (This was part of \u201cisolating us from society\u201d, Allen said.) \u201cWe only kept among ourselves, and only bonded with ourselves.\u201d This isolation was part of what kept Allen and others with Buddhafield. Indeed, even after the accusations some original members remain with Andreas and a new group of followers in Hawaii.

They\u2019re getting something out of it, and they\u2019re not going to give it up very easily.\u201d  It\u2019s easy perhaps to view the people who have stayed with Andreas as deluded \u2013 but such delusions are too common to simply be attributed to cults alone. As the 2015 film Spotlight highlighted, widespread abuse in the Catholic church went on for decades. When someone claims to represent God, or the divine, \u201cthey create this immense amount of trust between you and them,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnd that allows them, if they have no integrity or are unable to control themselves, it allows them more power to do what they want to do.\u201d  The opportunity to abuse authority goes beyond just religions, too. One interviewee in the film says that there are cults in every town in America. That doesn\u2019t mean that Buddhafield\u2019s particular mix of New Age spirituality is metastasizing. But it is an argument that the impulses and dynamics which made Buddhafield possible aren\u2019t solely the province of hippie truth-seekers.  \u201cI look at this pattern that we all as a human race have created,\u201d Allen said, \u201cwhere we end up in this pyramid/hierarchy, where there\u2019s someone at the top, and all the knowledge trickles down. This happens in corporations, this happens in religions, this happens all over the world. Why can\u2019t we have a democracy where people all know what\u2019s going on? Do people need someone to tell them what to do?\u201d  Allen\u2019s documentary is intended most directly to call Andreas to account. The director is hopeful that, as the film gains more attention, more of Andreas\u2019s followers will come to doubt him and eventually leave the group. \u201cThat\u2019s already happening,\u201d Allen said hopefully. \u201cPeople are already leaving, and only a few people who are devoted are still supporting him.\u201d But the broader message of Holy Hell isn\u2019t specifically about Andreas, or Buddhafield, or even necessarily about cults. Rather, the film is a warning that natural and even admirable human desires for love, for belonging, and for meaning can be manipulated by unscrupulous individuals to benefit themselves. Despots, in cults or in any context, seek to make themselves synonymous with community and with God. When such people try to gain power, Allen says, \u201cWe need to learn to recognize them. And not honor them.\u201d",
