  "body": "A black teenager says he was escorted out of his high school graduation ceremony in Sacramento, California, by three deputies after he refused to remove his kente cloth, a traditional Ghanaian silk and cotton fabric. In a statement issued Friday, the Elk Grove Unified School District confirmed the incident took place at the Sleep Train Arena on Tuesday. The Atlanta Black Star first reported the story. \u201cA Cosumnes Oaks High School student was prohibited from participating in the remainder of the school\u2019s graduation ceremony,\u201d the statement said, \u201cfor refusing to follow direction of school officials who were attempting to uphold the established dress code and for ignoring repeated requests to remove unauthorized non-school award regalia.\u201d    @nyreehesr so I wore this thing called a kente cloth (cultural cloth from Ghana) around my neck. That represents my, pic.twitter.com/6SG8NSnBFh\u2014 Nyree Holmes (@nyreehesr) May 25, 2016    The student, Nyree Holmes, told the Black Star he wore the decorative cloth atop his graduation robes in order to wear something that represented his culture during the ceremony. \u201cI wanted to wear my kente cloth as a representation of my pride in my ancestors, to display my cultural and religious heritage,\u201d he said. \u201cMy particular cloth was made by Christians in Ghana, where the kente cloth has been worn by royalty and during important ceremonies for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.\u201d Holmes, 18, who described the incident on Twitter, said the school\u2019s student activities director told him he was violating graduation dress requirements.  Holmes said he tried to talk to the director, but he would not engage and instead tried to prevent him from walking onstage and called authorities. When Holmes got off stage, he said, three sheriff\u2019s deputies were waiting to escort him out. The school district statement said: \u201cThe student was allowed to walk across the stage to be recognized and took a formal picture with the principal wearing the kente cloth. Later, the student was allowed to return to the area where students received their diplomas. The student was given his diploma.\u201d Holmes said the school principal met his parents and apologized for the incident. The school district statement added: \u201cThe district\u2019s approved graduation uniform is a cap and gown \u2026 Unfortunately, prior to the COHS graduation ceremony, school officials were not given the opportunity to discuss with the family the student\u2019s desire to wear the cloth.\u201d The district also said seniors and parents had received \u201cwritten and verbal communication on multiple occasions from school officials that reminded students regarding appropriate graduation ceremony attire\u201d.",
