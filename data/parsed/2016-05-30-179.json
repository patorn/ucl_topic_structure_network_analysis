  "body": "No muskets. That seems to be the big problem for The\u00a0Musketeers (BBC1, Saturday) at the start of the opener of the third and final series. They\u2019ve got their swords, which, as we know, they\u2019re very handy with, plus their looks \u2013 but they\u2019re up against what appears to be pretty much the entire Spanish army. Who have not just muskets but cannons, too. The cowardly French general isn\u2019t helping. Go and die for the king, he tells Athos, as cowardly generals generally do, and have done throughout history. He\u2019ll get his comeuppance, this General Lantier; first a hand is cleavered off \u2013 rudely axed like the show itself \u2013 then later his neck broken, like a turkey. Au revoir, monsieur le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Back on the battlefield, D\u2019Artagnan has a plan: attack! (obviously). They run at the Spanish ranks, dodging their bullets and cannonballs, splintering their pikes, before shanking them with satisfying steely noises, then blowing up their gunpowder stores. The charred remains of the Spanish army is picked over by crows, while Athos, Porthos and D\u2019Artagnan pick themselves up, dust themselves down and prepare for the next adventure. Hurrah! France 1, Spain 0. Hang on, where\u2019s Aramis? He\u2019s a monk now, though not a very convincing one. He doesn\u2019t look like one \u2013 tends his beard as another might a rose bush, as the abbot says. I don\u2019t think he (the abbot) is convinced that Aramis is really a monk, deep down. Maybe He (the Lord) isn\u2019t either. And I\u2019m pretty sure Aramis himself knows it, too. Yup, first sign of trouble and he springs into action, swishing his steel with the others. There\u2019s something of Duran Duran about those musketeers, mashed up with a little Meat Loaf. Right, the Spanish have been defeated, for now. But there\u2019s danger elsewhere, of course. This gothic, hooded dude, picking at the dead with the crows, for one. The grim reaper himself? Actually the Grimaud reaper, Lucien Grimaud (played by Matthew McNulty), a dodgy money-lender and powder-dealer, as well as the hand-lopper and neck-breaker. I\u2019m thinking Ozzy Osbourne. And Paris, lawless and dangerous, is now governed by Philippe Achille, Marquis de Feron (splendid by Rupert Everett, a welcome addition, turning up wicked to 11). \u201cCross me ... [long meaningful pause] and you live to regret it,\u201d he growls at the Musketeers. Alice Cooper, surely, in our game. Feron\u2019s Red Guard are running riot in the city: fighting, drinking and whoring, Philippe\u2019s Stags On Tour in Paris 1643. Nice stunt by Madame D\u2019Artagnan, smoking them out of the brothel and making them run bollock naked through the streets of the capital. Something similar happened in St Petersburg the other day, though less amusingly (it was a police raid, after a tip off from a vigilante former kickboxer and MMA fighter; the sex workers as well as their customers were paraded naked through the streets \u2013 in 2016!). Anyway, bad Feron is well connected \u2013 he\u2019s the king\u2019s illegitimate brother. That\u2019s King Louis XIII, meaning the kid with the wig on the fat pony (in the palace; love a pony indoors) will turn out to be Louis XIV. We\u2019ll be seeing a fair bit of him on BBC1 a little later on in life, in Versailles, which starts on Wednesday. This is like the kids\u2019 entertainment before that, the main event. It\u2019s the right thing to do, I think, to end it after three series; any more and it would begin to wear thin. But it has been \u2013 and is \u2013 a lot of fun. A swashbuckling (hard to avoid the word) romp that will appeal to anyone who has ever dreamed of adventure and romance, handsome beardy men with swords, and porcelain-skinned ladies bursting from bodices. It\u2019s a funny time to go out, 9.30pm. Then, next week, it\u2019s on at 8.30pm so that it actually straddles the watershed, as if they can\u2019t quite decide whether it\u2019s for a Merlin audience, or an older, Versailles one. I think A. Versailles is a lot of fun, too, by the way. Still in France, Lyon now, for The\u00a0Disappearance (BBC4, Saturday). The Morel family are almost stereotypically French: cool, grownup, beautiful \u2013 verging on annoyingly so. There are no secrets between L\u00e9a and her mother, Florence \u2026 well, Florence thought there weren\u2019t. On the eve of her 17th birthday, L\u00e9a goes out to a concert and club with friends. And she doesn\u2019t come back. At which point it becomes almost unbearable, a tight knot of anxiety will form in the stomach of any parent. Death, violence, horror, severed hands, pas de probl\u00e8me \u2013 love it. But missing children I find hard. The Disappearance isn\u2019t just about anxiety, guilt and grief; there\u2019s an investigation going on, headed by lugubrious out-of-town investigator Bertrand Molina, with avenues and suspicions to explore. But what dominates the screen is an absence \u2013 the big black hole where L\u00e9a was. I still have nightmares about The\u00a0Missing; I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for The Missing With Subtitles.",
