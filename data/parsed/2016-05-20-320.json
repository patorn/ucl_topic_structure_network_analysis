  "body": "Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts? I have to work with a colleague who \u2013 not to put too fine a point on it \u2013 is fundamentally incompetent at his job. He occupies a mid-senior role and I\u2019m at a loss as to why he was hired in the first place or how he passed his probation.  We are a website and he barely seems to grasp how the internet works, let alone the relatively advanced levels of analysis that his role demands. If he held a junior position it would be more tolerable, but as it is he is at best dead weight, and at worst an annoyance.  I am not alone in thinking this. In meetings, his input causes awkward pauses as people attempt to digest that someone has suggested such a bad idea. If you explain why it is not viable (and in most cases would probably be harmful to the business) and methodically list your points, he will just repeat his initial idea as if he hasn\u2019t heard anything you\u2019ve said. He was hired by another team, with whom he passed his probation, and is now being foisted on us. Our company embraces \u201cagile management\u201d, where you have a fluid structure of partly self-sufficient business units, and personnel moving between these is encouraged \u2013 usually this is a good thing. Infuriatingly, he\u2019s keen to remain with our team as we\u2019re \u201csuch nice guys\u201d. I can only assume this is because we\u2019re generally polite to him. I work closely with him and he is a drain on my time. I\u2019m unsure as to how to proceed. I am sure you can sense my sheer frustration, but I don\u2019t like the idea of getting someone fired. Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy\u2019s and readers\u2019 help, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com. Please note that he is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or to reply personally.",
