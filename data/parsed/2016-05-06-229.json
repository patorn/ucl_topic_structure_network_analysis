  "body": "I\u2019d be at my mother\u2019s house, in Wimbledon. It\u2019s where I grew up, and it\u2019s full of memories. My mum has forever hosted people: actors, musicians, singers, mostly from the Bangladeshi community. Her home always feels full of life. We are opposites, my mother and I. I\u2019m a true minimalist. I like simple, pure lines, monochrome spaces devoid of decoration. My mother loves plants and colour and photos and ornaments \u2013 she\u2019s a collector at heart. Where she is western painting, I\u2019m Japanese: while everyone was filling the canvas here, the Japanese were emptying it. I\u2019m interested in that \u2013 space, natural space, internal space. I\u2019d want to eat in the garden. It would be late summer, nearly autumn \u2013 I love the transition between seasons more than the seasons themselves. The garden is magnificent and chaotic, full of blues, reds, yellows, purples, greens. My mother would be there, along with my family and Eddie Izzard. I\u2019d also want Bj\u00f6rk and the film director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu to come. I\u2019d love to have a conversation with Stravinsky about patterns (I see them where he hears them) and another with Aung San Suu Kyi about the obsession of power. Lastly, I\u2019d like Thomas Heatherwick to join us. He\u2019s in the wrong job \u2013 he should be a choreographer. He talks like one. He thinks in the realms of movement \u2013 of the object, yes \u2013 but not just its physicality; of how it moves in space. It\u2019d be a feast of Japanese food. Sashimi, tuna in particular. Japanese rice. Miso soup. Okonomiyaki. I\u2019m a big meat eater, but I wouldn\u2019t want much meat for this meal. Mostly vegetables \u2013 which is unusual for me. Japanese salad is the only time I allow something green to be within 5 miles of my plate. I only started eating green things after I married my wife, Yuko, who is from Kyushu. It\u2019s the types of leaf, and the miso and citruses in the dressings. They are so creative with vegetables. And then chocolate. I have a sweet tooth. It has to be Cadbury\u2019s milk chocolate \u2013 in my pocket, not on the table. I\u2019m not going to share that with anyone. I\u2019d have Matcha green tea, and to finish, a cappuccino. No music. Bj\u00f6rk might sing, Stravinsky would be tapping away. I would just be listening.  Akram Khan Company: Until the Lions is at Brighton Festival from 26-27 May 2016; brightonfestival.org",
