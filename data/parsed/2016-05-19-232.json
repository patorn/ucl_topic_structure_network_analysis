BT Sport\u2019s live coverage of Wednesday night\u2019s final, which the broadcaster made free to non-subscribers on a variety of different platforms including YouTube, drew an average of 1.6 million viewers on BT Sport Europe and another 606,000 viewers at the same time on BT Sport Showcase, a combined audience of 2.2 million. The combined five-minute peak across both channels was 3.6 million, with a high of 2.6 million watching on BT Sport Europe and another 1 million on BT Sport Showcase.

Audiences for the Europa League and Champions League have inevitably taken a tumble since the exclusive live rights were bought by BT in an \u00a3897m deal three years ago, beginning with the 2015/2016 season.  Previously the rights were shared by ITV, which broadcast all its games free to air, and pay-TV partner Sky.",
