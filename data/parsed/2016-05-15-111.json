If you get most of your news from Facebook, then you might not be exposed to those sources much, either. Gizmodo reported on Monday that Facebook employees had deliberately filtered out conservative sources from its trending bar. Facebook has denied allegations of bias.  To find out what I might be missing, I have spent the last three days getting all my news from conservative media. I got rid of my lamestream media apps and went straight to the angry, rightwing source. One of most startling things I learned is just how willing the federal government is to waste taxpayers\u2019 money. On Tuesday, the Washington Times reported that taxpayers had \u201cpaid for one scientist to have a bee sting his penis\u201d, in a study that had been reported by the Guardian the year before.  The study was conducted by a researcher named Michael L Smith, who was trying to find out which was the most painful place to be stung by a bee. The penis was the third-most painful place, behind the nose and the upper lip. While I didn\u2019t know about penis-bee-sting-gate, I did already know that Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, and the problems therein, were a big deal to conservative media.  But I hadn\u2019t realised just quite how big of a deal. Or how vague of a deal. \u201cEmails. Clinton. Scandal. Emails. Her emails. Corrupt.\u201d Barely five minutes goes by on rightwing radio without Clinton\u2019s emails being mentioned. Most of the time there is no explanation of the story, or any update to the story. Instead, \u201cHillary\u2019s emails\u201d is used as a two-word dismissal of Clinton\u2019s bid for president. It\u2019s also used as a two-word reprieve for any Republican politicians, frequently invoked when discussing any Donald Trump mishap.  \u201cDonald Trump still hasn\u2019t released his tax returns.\u201d \u201cYeah. But Hillary\u2019s emails.\u201d Since Ted Cruz dropped out of the race for president, most conservative news outlets and commentators have fallen into line in backing Trump. But some are extremely sensitive about it. During his radio show on Thursday evening, Sean Hannity addressed people who he said were criticising him for supporting Trump. He didn\u2019t care what people were saying from their computers, he said. It didn\u2019t bother him at all. Because he had never backtracked. He had never said he wouldn\u2019t support Trump anyway.  For a man not bothered, he certainly talked for a long time about it. I made it nearly five minutes. But it shows the toxicity around Trump, even within conservative media.     Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, speaks to Sean Hannity in New York City. Photograph: John Lamparski/Getty Images    If the more mainstream of the conservative outlets are backing Trump, there are bastions of anti-Trump sentiment out there. One of my favourite websites became the Right Scoop. It\u2019s great. It doesn\u2019t get any scoops. Instead, it\u2019s more a series of rants written by one angry person who really hates Trump. Anyone who displays support for Trump is labelled a \u201cTrumpbot\u201d. Fox News personalities Tucker Carlson and Eric Bolling were both labelled Trumpbots last week for suggesting people should support the billionaire.  One post, headlined: \u201cOkay Fox News, I think I\u2019m gonna gag ...\u201d, was just a video of a Fox presenter asking Donald Trump if he thought Budweiser had changed its name to \u201cAmerica\u201d because of his campaign. Trump agreed. The comments section is vitriolic. Under a piece about Trump refusing to release his tax returns, Trump is dubbed \u201cDon the con\u201d in one comment, and his missing tax returns are compared to Clinton\u2019s missing emails (there we go again) in another. And this is by conservative voters. Away from the political trail, one common theme among conservative media is the idea that white people are under attack in America. It was brought home when I was listening to New York\u2019s WOR radio on Friday. Len Berman \u2013 he\u2019s like a poor man\u2019s Rush Limbaugh \u2013 and Todd Schnitt \u2013 an extremely down-on-his-luck man\u2019s Glenn Beck \u2013 host the morning show. On Friday morning, the pair discussed a news story about a bus for a Jewish school that had been set on fire. Five boys, aged between 11 and 14, had been arrested in connection with the fire. A video accompanying the story showed that the children alleged to have caused the fire were African American. Berman and Schnitt posited that if the children who had set fire to the bus were white, and had been attacking a school bus for black children, there would have been more of a furore in the media. In this case, \u201clittle black kids\u201d had attacked white Jewish kids, Berman and Schnitt told us. But we don\u2019t hear that reported, they said.  White people are persecuted. People of colour get a free pass. Sean Hannity had made a similar point on his show earlier in the week, when he brought up comments made by Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice. She had said that there was a lack of diversity in key government posts. Hannity noted that we have been told before that the government is too white. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard this before: that we\u2019re cowardly when it comes to race,\u201d Hannity said. He didn\u2019t say when we had been told we are cowardly when it comes to race. Hannity said that African Americans only make up 12% of the population. By that measure, there have to be a lot of white people who voted for Obama.  \u201cSo we\u2019re not that cowardly,\u201d Hannity concluded \u2013 responding to an accusation that he only had made. If the government is too white, \u201cmaybe Obama hired the wrong people\u201d, Hannity said.  So there you go. There\u2019s no problem with race in America. At least not from the white side. The problem is Obama. Still. Amid all the Clinton-Trump-race-federal waste noise, Obama was the recurring theme. Obama is hiring the wrong people. Obama and his staff are antagonising white people. Obama is also running an \u201canti-American agenda\u201d, according to Mark Belling, a pundit who filled in for Rush Limbaugh on Wednesday. This was because the president was going to Japan to \u201capologise\u201d for bombing Hiroshima, Belling said. Belling said this despite having just played a clip in which an Obama spokesman said that the trip was not an apology. Limbaugh himself had told listeners on Tuesday that Obama had an anti-suburb agenda. The president is \u201cwaging war\u201d on them, Limbaugh said, by forcing developers to build affordable housing in some suburbs. \u201cThe one thing you have to understand about liberals is they hate suburbia,\u201d Limbaugh told his listeners on Tuesday.  \u201cThey despise it. They despise suburbia because of who lives there. They despise suburbia because it exists. They despise suburbia because there\u2019s no mass transit. They despise suburbia because it\u2019s a lot of cars and SUVs and soccer moms destroying the planet by climate change.\u201d While it\u2019s unlikely that Obama is actually targeting suburbs, the Limbaugh rant was quite revealing in how different sides of the political spectrum see each other. It\u2019s easy to scoff at the lumping in of all liberals as hating suburbs. But is it that different from liberals characterizing Trump supporters, for example, as angry bigots who hate anything that isn\u2019t American? Maybe there\u2019s a lesson there for us all. Two lessons, actually.  The second is that, in the world of rightwing media, some may like Donald Trump. Some may dislike Donald Trump. But no one likes Hillary Clinton, and, especially, no one likes Barack Obama.
