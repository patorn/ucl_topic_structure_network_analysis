  "body": "Greg Broussard is explaining how he found his voice \u2013 a purr of a voice; a slick, calm invitation. It\u2019s the voice of his musical alter ego, the Egyptian Lover, and he owes the voice to Prince.  \u201cOn a long version of one of his songs, Controversy, he\u2019s saying [Broussard goes into an impression here]: \u2018People call me rude / I wish we all were nude.\u2019 I liked that chant style, so I tried to be cool with it. I started lowering my voice, trying different things, and it just fit along with the songs. It wasn\u2019t screaming or overpowering, more a seductive way of talking to women.\u201d \u201cBack then,\u201d Broussard adds, laughing, \u201cwhen we had actual real telephones, you had to have a good telephone voice \u2013 you had to do that in order to get women. Nowadays you can sound like Mickey Mouse and get a girlfriend because it\u2019s all text messages.\u201d Greg Broussard has the kind of easy, hearty laugh that bespeaks both amusement at life\u2019s foibles and complete ease with where he\u2019s at, perhaps because he helped shape the music of the future since his earliest singles in the 1980s. Call it groundbreaking hip-hop or call it the first wave of electro on the US west coast, but it\u2019s something that resonates from then to now, attracting an audience that includes those who remember his early music and those who have discovered him via a more circuitous route. \u201cI\u2019ll do a show, let\u2019s say, in Paris,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a hundred old-school guys my age there, and the rest are all young guys and girls. It\u2019s pretty crazy to see the young and the old listening to the same kind of music having a good time.\u201d Now the Egyptian Lover\u2019s past has been drawn together on a new collection, Anthology 1983-1988. Each cut showcases his trademark: a sleek, stark but always lively combination of electronic beats and minimal funk grooves, with his low-key calls and declarations to get down and get it on. Every song is a party; put them together and it\u2019s the kind of party you want never to end.            He was inspired at first by early electro \u2013 Afrika Bambaataa\u2019s Planet Rock, Twilight Kingdom by Electric 22 \u2013 and by the records that inspired those artists (Kraftwerk\u2019s Numbers was a key track) as well as Prince\u2019s lithe dawn-of-the-1980s synth-funk. He set about building his tracks in layers, starting with \u201cdrum machine, maybe a beat programmed. And I could play it really loud in the studio, until I could get something I really liked. Then I started adding the keys, the bassline, the strings. I would let the record play over and over again, sit in the studio and write the lyrics to the record while it was being played. Then go on to the microphone, do the vocals and the song was done.\u201d He learned how records work by spending time in clubs, which is why the vocals were the least laboured-over part of Egyptian Lover tracks. \u201cI started out as a dancer,\u201d he says, \u201cand I used to go to the clubs to dance. Then I became a DJ, and I knew what records or what parts of the records to play. Everybody liked these certain parts, so I would extend the breakdowns, put more breakdowns over the breakdowns, then more breakdowns and beats, because that\u2019s what I wanted to dance to. When I was watching the crowd dance to certain records, they\u2019d love the beats, they didn\u2019t need to have words. I put the words on there so people know the name of the song.\u201d The Egyptian Lover character was inspired by the imagery from Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s releases, and from Broussard\u2019s trip to see the treasures of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb when they toured the US in the late 70s. \u201cI saw the King Tut exhibit, with this young king with his own empire, and that\u2019s why I called my label Egyptian Empire.\u201d             And there was another singer who really fired Broussard up. \u201cDean Martin has inspired me more than anyone has ever known,\u201d he says. \u201cDean Martin was that sexy, \u2018I got women\u2019 kind of guy. I was in love with that whole image, and that\u2019s where a lot of the Egyptian Lover\u2019s image came from. He had a song called Crying Time, and I took that and made I Cry (Night After Night). My dad had a collection of Dean Martin albums, and I could pick the very first one he made, one in the middle of his career and one at the end of his career, and every one of those albums sound the same. I said to myself, \u2018If I ever became a singer\u2019 \u2013 this was before rap \u2013 \u2018I would do it exactly like that.\u2019 Because now when you buy a Dean Martin album, you\u2019re getting a Dean Martin album. So I\u2019m not going to change my style.\u201d He\u2019s still pursuing that style \u2013 he talks about the 12in singles he plans to release from last year\u2019s album 1984, and his hope to write a film script based on his life story. Whatever comes next, he\u2019s still dedicated to his sound, and sure he\u2019ll always find his audience. \u201cWhen you feel that beat and hear that music,\u201d he says, \u201cit makes you want to dance, it makes you feel good and have a good time. To this very day, some people like this sound, some people looooove this sound, and they go way out in the field to hear it.\u201d  The Egyptian Lover plays the Jazz Cafe in London on 2 June. Anthology 1983-1988 is out now on Stones Throw Records.",
