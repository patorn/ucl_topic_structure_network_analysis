  "body": "There\u2019s a new biscuit in town\u2026 and he goes by the name of Alan Taylor. He\u2019s got a tin full of cash, not to mention electric muscles!  When this news reaches Mr Gum, he simply can\u2019t stop himself from trying to bamboozle clueless Alan Taylor out of his fortune.  After a sidesplitting failed attempt however, Mr Gum is determined as ever to get his grubby hands on that money.  When Mr Gum and his partner in crime, Billy William III, do manage to steal the tin of cash, they go so far as to make plans to move to France. But will do-gooders Polly and Friday make it in time to save Alan Taylor\u2019s money?         My favourite character is Jonathan Ripples because he\u2019s fat, daft, but all together, he\u2019s a big softie! I would strongly recommend this book for 7-10 year olds because of the big text and many illustrations. This book will have you blubbering with glee!
