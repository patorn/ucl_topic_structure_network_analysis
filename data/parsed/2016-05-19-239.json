  "body": "In the strange tale of Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power, it makes sense that women\u2019s votes are thought to be what will stop him from winning the White House. It would be poetic justice: the candidate who speaks about women as objects and animals \u2013 the man known for \u201cpersonally evaluating\u201d pageant contestants and commenting on female employees\u2019 weight \u2013 losing with the largest gender gap in voting history.  It\u2019s a nice story, one I quite like. But this hopeful happy ending isn\u2019t a given \u2013 and if the general election becomes a referendum on how tolerable Americans find sexism, we may find that the answer doesn\u2019t match the optimistic stories we tell ourselves. While feminism is wielding more cultural power than it has in decades, women\u2019s gains in the US have historically been followed by periods of backlash. Some voters will see Trump\u2019s comments about women not as mistreatment, but as a refreshing counter to \u201cPC culture\u201d run amok.  Republican leaders are already signaling that they\u2019re ready to gloss over Trump\u2019s sexism. When asked about a New York Times piece outlining Trump\u2019s treatment of women over the years, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus responded that \u201cpeople just don\u2019t care\u201d about the issue. And this week, Fox News televised Trump making nice with Megyn Kelly, the pundit Trump has called a \u201cbimbo\u201d and suggested was tough on him during a debate because she was menstruating. In the meantime, Democrats seem to be under the mistaken impression that merely showcasing Trump\u2019s sexism is enough to sway Americans. But in the wake of Bernie Sanders supporters leaving death threats and misogynist slurs on a Nevada official\u2019s voicemail, it\u2019s become harder to ignore the pernicious gender issues that plague the left. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign needs to explain to voters why they should care about Trump\u2019s misogyny \u2013 and misogyny in general \u2013 and talk about the impact it could have. Because sexism knows no party, and some of those irate male Sanders fans could make their way to Trump instead of supporting Clinton (something Trump\u2019s campaign is prepared for.) It\u2019s true, the vast majority of Democratic voters aren\u2019t misogynists. But they\u2019re not all feminists either. If the Democratic elite assumes that all liberal voters are outraged by sexism, they\u2019ll be making the same devastating miscalculation the GOP elite did when they assumed Republican voters were tied to the same conservative ideals they cared about. The media needs to continue to report on how horrible Trump is on women\u2019s issues in both his political and personal life, and Democrats need to hammer home why that matters to the daily lives of all Americans. We can\u2019t afford to be overly optimistic on how much this message will resonate without a national conversation about gender, power and politics. Not if we want our fairytale ending.",
