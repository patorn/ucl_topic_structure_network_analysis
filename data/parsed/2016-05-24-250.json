  "body": "With Tanya Donnelly\u2019s band Belly reuniting, thoughts naturally turn to one of the great indie might-have-beens. Just as you might wonder how things might have turned out if Dylan had never gone electric, the Beatles had been allergic to LSD or the Strokes had looked like the Pigeon Detectives, a certain breed of 80s alt-rock fan pines for the crossover success Throwing Muses might have achieved, had Tanya Donelly been given equal songwriting standing with her stepsister and bandmate Kristin Hersh. Belly songs such as Feed the Tree, Gepetto and Slow Dog could have helped make 1992\u2019s Red Heaven a rounded crank-pop masterpiece. Instead, Donelly\u2019s melodic panache was squeezed out and Hersh was left alone to deal with Rat Girl, the other competing force in Throwing Muses. Rather than write songs, you see, Hersh was virtually taken over by them. The child of hippy commune parents called Crane and Dude, she wound up in hospital aged 16 when her bike was hit by a car and, as her memoir Paradoxical Undressing describes, she started to hear \u201ca metallic whining, like industrial noise \u2026 layered with humming tones and wind chimes\u201d. \u201cSound and colour filled my empty hospital room,\u201d Hersh wrote, and music became an invasive force, beyond her ability to control. \u201cThe songs move into my spine,\u201d she told the Observer in 2010, \u201cand they make me frantic.\u201d Her performances, none of which she could remember, were like \u201cwell-rehearsed Tourette\u2019s\u201d or \u201ca cliff-dive into oblivion\u201d; she never knew if music, for her, was therapy or disease.   Related: Kristin Hersh: 'I hate music'    Hersh came up with a name for the alternate personality who was born in the hospital that day and began writing and performing her songs for her. She called her Rat Girl.            Rat Girl was a caustic character, constantly flirting with incorrect keys, mistreating time signatures like a flippant dominatrix and letting her larynx do the occasional demonic jitterbug. \u201cTheir angry, edgy nature reflected the sound inside my head,\u201d Hersh said of her early songs, and her themes were often just as disturbing. Throwing Muses became a byword for college-rock feminism in the late 80s, largely because of Hersh\u2019s uncompromising impressionist poetry of emotional anguish, subjugated womanhood and mental illness. Bedrooms were cold, families dislocated, love dissolving, bodies malformed and twisted with the pain of being misunderstood, ignored or taken for granted. While her 4AD labelmates Pixies were screaming about sex, gods and monsters, Hersh \u2013 dealing with what would eventually be diagnosed as dissociative disorder, squatting with heroin addicts and surviving several suicide attempts \u2013 was howling out her own torments. With 1988\u2019s Hunkpapa, her songwriting softened: Dizzy is surely one of the greatest pop songs ever written about the delirium of interracial sex. Or possibly sunstroke, depending on your reading. By 1991\u2019s The Real Ramona, Throwing Muses were firmly in step with US indie rock\u2019s march on the mainstream, led by REM and Nirvana. Donelly\u2019s languid/menacing Honeychain and her grunge pop career-best Not Too Soon \u2013 complete with a hook that appeared to have been recorded by Hersh lassoing Donelly\u2019s tonsils with her guitar string \u2013 mingled with Hersh\u2019s spiky dustbowl confessionals, Counting Backwards, Red Shoes and Hook in Her Head, to create a balanced noir folk classic, half grit, half gold.

Donelly left the band to concentrate on her work with the Breeders and to start her own band, Belly; Hersh has been developing her own quirky artistry ever since, her collaborative full-band projects delivered under the Throwing Muses banner or with the 50FootWave power trio she launched in 2003, and her more personal albums recorded under her own name, on which she often plays every instrument. Complete control has suited her, calming her more erratic musical mood-swings and letting her flex her pop muscles. Throwing Muses albums relaxed into winding grooves and more direct, muscular rock, as Hersh revelled in her new space. She took on new, cool partners, too \u2013 Bob Mould helped beef up the grungier end of 1992\u2019s Red Heaven and Michael Stipe adorned her haunting debut solo single Your Ghost. When the poor sales of 1995\u2019s critically acclaimed University saw the Muses separate from Sire Records, Hersh launched the Throwing Music label to release the band\u2019s records. \u201cWe opted out of [the] recording industry,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we disagreed with it and we felt morally bound to no longer participate.\u201d Ensconced in her own self-contained world, juggling music, mental imbalance and a very difficult parenthood (she lost a custody battle for her first child, Dylan), her lyrics naturally became more soul-dredging and her solo albums became like listening in on some sort of obtuse poetry therapy. 2001\u2019s Candyland tackled the custody battle, Listerine dwelt on the Muses split: \u201cHow\u2019d I trust a band who\u2019d leave me one by one?\u201d Most chillingly, she addressed her mental issues directly on The Letter, from 1994\u2019s Hips and Makers, an open letter to Rat Girl: \u201cI\u2019m crawling on the ground rolling on the floor, I\u2019m gonna cry, you look for me,\u201d she sang, before signing off, \u201clove Kristin. PS Keep them coming\u201d. It\u2019s here that Hersh becomes one of indie rock\u2019s most fascinating figures. By denying responsibility for the creative act and passing it on to Rat Girl, she makes work that can be read as music in its purest form; dislocated from the artist, writing and performing itself through an innocent conduit. So is this the true sound of music, as it wants to be heard? Pained, confused, disjointed and menacing, but always revolving around a fundamental beauty?            Yay or nay, being a fan of Hersh is a whole different sort of guilty pleasure, almost music as voyeurism or schadenfreude. Donelly once commented that Hersh \u201cdoesn\u2019t even like music\u201d and she certainly has an uncomfortable relationship with her own. She didn\u2019t enjoy her songs and could not fathom why any crowd member would want to put themselves through a gig full of them. For much of her career, writing or hearing a good song would prompt suicidal urges. \u201cThat combination of beauty and death,\u201d she explained, \u201cit\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d   Related: Kristin Hersh on Vic Chesnutt: 'I know what a broken heart is now'    Her ex-husband begged her to give up music, but her attempts to stop writing came to naught. Music was irrefusable. Of late though, Hersh has made peace with some, if not all, of her demons. In 2003, there was a reunion with Donelly in a reformed Muses, and courses of acupuncture and eye-movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy have helped calm her disorder. \u201cThe songs come very cleanly now,\u201d she has said. \u201cI can hear them better. Mania is a very noisy thing. There\u2019s static, voices that would get in the way.\u201d Today Hersh seems, at last, a free spirit. Like so many other cult heroes, cut off from the industry\u2019s umbilical cord, she\u2019s forged a cottage industry in order to keep feeding her ravenous muse. Her fan-funded CASH Music model, allowing her to create artefacts rather than albums: 2010\u2019s claustrophobic solo Crooked and 2013\u2019s sprawling and fitful 32-track Muses revival Purgatory/Paradise were released as books of lyrics, artwork and digital download codes. She performs solo tours involving between-song recitals to help her bond with her fans, wrote a book about her late touring buddy Vic Chesnutt, and moves her family from place to place, unable to shift some essential restlessness. And, crucially, after decades at each other\u2019s creative throats, she and Rat Girl have become awkward friends. PS Keep them coming.",
