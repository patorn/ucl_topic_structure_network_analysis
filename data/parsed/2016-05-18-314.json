  "body": "As the EU referendum draws closer, our expert panel answers a question from one of our readers about the potential effect on small businesses\u2019 intellectual property.  What would Brexit mean for my business\u2019s intellectual property rights in Europe?  If you have a question about the impact of the EU referendum on small businesses, you can submit it here.      Swati Dhingra  Assistant professor at the department of economics at the London School of Economics, researching international economics, globalisation and industrial policy. Co-author of the recent Life after Brexit report by LSE\u2019s centre for economic performance, which looked at the UK\u2019s options outside the EU. Intellectual property (IP) protected through European mechanisms such as the European Patent Office, would continue to prevail after Brexit. But Britain would need to legislate on what happens to protections granted through EU directives such as the community trade mark. Many IP lawyers believe Britain would adopt these EU directives into its own law, so there should be a fairly smooth transition of protection under Brexit. A long-term concern with Brexit is that Britain would miss out on the unitary patent regime that is on the EU\u2019s agenda. The unitary patent would provide for a single application, a single fee and a single court for IP protection across the EU. If Britain exits the EU, it would need to negotiate to participate in the unitary patent and to have its judges in the enforcement process. A broader concern is that Britain would lose its voice in shaping future EU regulations and its easy access to the EU\u2019s research funding and scientific collaboration, which could constrain innovation in sectors such as medicine.  The unitary patent has been under negotiation for years, but there is some reason for optimism on the EU\u2019s future IP agenda. For instance, a recent European parliamentary report has proposed a harmonisation of copyright rules across the EU and a broad copyright limitation similar to fair use in US copyright law, which could spur further innovation.      Liz Wood Founder of, and lawyer at, Virtuoso Legal; experienced in all aspects of intellectual property law and practice with particular expertise in complex IP litigation The UK\u2019s IP legislation is harmonised across all of Europe, meaning Europe offers a pretty level playing field when it comes to the registration and enforcement of trade marks, design rights and patents. A number of EU directives have sought to harmonise certain domestic laws in relation to intellectual property; these include directives on copyright and design law.  That allows for judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union to be binding on our courts, and UK lawyers can apply the principles of these judgments in their day-to-day work. At the moment, if a UK business\u2019s IP rights are infringed in another European member state the same principles will apply as in the United Kingdom. However, if we were to exit the EU, the UK would be free to make its own legislation in relation to IP rights, such as copyright.  If the UK votes to leave there will be a transitionary period in which rights with the EU are re-negotiated. In practice this will mean that much legislation has to be re-drafted within a tight time frame, which could lead to unexpected consequences. It is likely that existing rights will be retained but, again, complex conversion legislation would need to be put in place. Such legislation would need to protect outstanding applications for EU rights, priority for further applications and existing EU opposition proceedings. Enforcement of IP rights could also be affected \u2013 UK courts would no longer be designated as EU courts, so their decisions may have to be litigated elsewhere in the EU as well. Claims for pan-European injunctions to stop infringement activity in Europe, which are currently possible, would be impossible to get.      Ted Shapiro Partner in Brussels at Wiggin LLP media, technology and IP law firm. An expert in international and European copyright law, he assists clients on issues related to policy, litigation, compliance and commercial matters Copyright in the EU is still largely territorial. However, UK businesses reliant on copyright will be affected by pending EU regulatory (the so-called pay-TV case, which relates to EU competition rules) and legislative initiatives (the draft portability regulation and a further proposal expected in the autumn) \u2013 whether the UK is in or out.  The impact for such businesses ultimately depends on the deal the UK cuts if it decides to go. If the UK decides to strike a deal to be within the European Economic Area then the UK would still be required to follow EU copyright rules but would no longer have a say in formulating them. There is copyright reform on the horizon as part of the EU\u2019s digital single market strategy.
