  "body": "Friday\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook Happy Frankel day, as someone on my Twitter timeline has just called it. Today\u2019s second race at Newbury will show us the first of Frankel\u2019s offspring to make it to the track when John Gosden\u2019s Cunco lines up in a six-furlong maiden for two-year-olds.   Related: Horse racing tips: Friday 13 May    Cunco is supposed to be pretty useful but it would be fair to say there are some doubts in the air about how good a stallion Frankel is going to be, despite the initial price tag of \u00a3125,000 for his services. The phrase \u201call shapes and sizes\u201d has been used repeatedly to describe his stock, which is widely thought to be a negative in the bloodstock world because a top-class stallion is supposed to \u201cstamp\u201d his stock, producing endless iterations of himself. Whatever happens to Cunco at 2pm, it will be too early to judge his sire and we won\u2019t get a rounded picture of Frankel\u2019s talent as a stallion until much later in the year, or really next year. For what it\u2019s worth, Cunco looks pretty short to me at the morning 13-8, considering he\u2019s up against a handful of rivals who could be precocious. I\u2019m a bit annoyed that Alcatraz is a non-runner at Newmarket, depriving me of the chance to describe him as \u201crock-solid\u201d. I shall divert my attention to an earlier race on the same card in which Song Of Norway (3.20) is a 7-1 shot. I should probably make a Eurovision joke about her name but I\u2019m still sulking about Alcatraz. This mare improved in the early part of last year after joining Ann Duffield from Peter Makin and did so again when scoring first time for Chris Wall in September. Her final two runs of the year, at Kempton, were perfectly fair but she has never won on the all-weather. The return to fast turf should help her take another step forward and I like her chance today, considering Wall has been in great form and that she has a good record when fresh. York\u2019s card has a slightly fag-end feel to it after the excitements of the Musidora and the Dante over the past two days. The 11-4 is better than I was expecting about Just That Lord (2.20), a handicap blot in the opener after hosing up at Windsor. And I think Amlak (2.55) may be able to outrun her odds of 11-1 after showing lots of ability under tender handling at Ascot last week. Tipping competition, day five Our winners so far: Monday Bayan Kasirga 11-1 Wordismybond 5-1 Quick N Quirky 9-2 Tuesday Sir Dylan 7-2 Livella Fella 12-1 Lady Bayside 8-1 Wednesday Magical Memory 5-2 So Mi Dar 4-5 Castle Harbour 9-2 Thursday Wings Of Desire 9-1 Always Smile 8-1 Saigon City 33-1 And our leader is: kingklynch +39.50 ... who was joint-leader after a Day One double and is now back on top thanks to somehow picking Saigon City. Incredibly, two others also found that shock winner and so it\u2019s still competitive at the top of our leaderboard. Other good scores: Toptrapper +37, Harrytheactor +27.50, jakebuckfast +21.80, waltersobchak +16.30, melonk +15.80, BearRides +15.50, factormax +13.50, 16heathermac01 +13, Copshaw +11, chris1623 +10. For today\u2019s thrilling climax, we\u2019d like your tips, please, for these races: 4.40 York, 5.10 York, 5.40 York. This week\u2019s prize is a copy of Addicted to Horse Racing by Norton Howells, a late convert to the greatest game, who tells us his tales of trying to crack the code of gambling success. \u201cThe writing is precise yet evocative, with nothing held back, as we discover the vivid consequences of an obsession,\u201d the press release tells me. If you don\u2019t win, you can buy a copy here [ http://shop1.racingpost.com/Addicted-To-Horseracing-by-Norton-Howells-p/addhor.htm ] As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today but you will start on -12. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.
