  "body": "On an unseasonably damp night in Manchester, in a soulless football stadium, Santa Claus is coming to town. \u201cYou got to help us out, man,\u201d burrs Bruce Springsteen as Father Christmas is brought out of the crowd: a fan holding his request on a piece of cardboard, as many have done successfully over the years. E Street Band guitarist Steve Van Zandt stands back from the mic he usually shares with his bandleader, leaving a gangly bloke in red fancy dress \u201cmaking a list, and checking it twice\u201d next to rock\u2019s kindest superstar. Synthesiser sleigh bells ring brightly through the rain: there are magical gig moments, and then there\u2019s the way of the Boss. Tonight\u2019s is a more varied show than your usual Springsteen gig, however. Praised for his classy set-opening tributes to David Bowie and Prince in recent months (Rebel Rebel for the former; Purple Rain, on a spotlit purple stage, for the latter), he begins tonight with 1982\u2019s epically mournful Atlantic City, another nod towards the yawning of the grave. \u201cEverything dies, baby, that\u2019s a fact,\u201d the chorus goes. His voice is untouched by the years, full of dirt, guts and soul. Even on the next line \u2013 \u201cMaybe everything that dies someday comes back\u201d \u2013 there\u2019s a mournfulness in the air that you wouldn\u2019t expect on the first night of a UK tour. Still, he\u2019s lost several band members in the past decade. And it doesn\u2019t help that the gig is barely full at kick-off (6.53pm, to allow for its marathon length) because of tram cancellations. If only Bruce knew. There\u2019s surely a song in his canon about the beleaguered tram operator. Tonight\u2019s mood might be coloured by the tour\u2019s focus, too. This is The River tour, focusing on the 1980 double LP which found Springsteen at an awkward artistic crossroads. He goes through a fair whack of its 20 songs tonight, chronologically, thankfully with breaks to play other parts of his catalogue. It\u2019s Springsteen\u2019s White Album in many ways: not a record of wilful experimentalism, but one on which he\u2019s unsure whether to be a raucous barroom rocker, a mainstream chart star or a thoughtful storyteller. On record, this is sometimes oddly jarring (he\u2019d resolve the disjoint by going full lo-fi on 1982\u2019s Nebraska, then full megastar on 1984\u2019s Born in the USA). Live, it\u2019s a much more rewarding experience.      Bruce Springsteen and E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt.

Crush on You, one of Springsteen\u2019s thinner songs, becomes a deliciously rough, full-blooded piece of garage rock. Sherry Darling is delivered with similar dirt and heat. An audience member is given the mic to sing a line, then the whole stadium yowls in. Then comes Hungry Heart, which was Springsteen\u2019s first proper hit (he\u2019d had several before with other people performing them: Because the Night for Patti Smith, which the band also play, brilliantly, later in the set, and Fire, a US No 2 for the Pointer Sisters). His joy at singing Hungry Heart tonight, though, is utterly infectious: he barrels through the crowd as he sings, a pensioner becoming a young man again. Later on, The River\u2019s title track takes us to a very different young man: one whose young life is over all too quickly, having flowed through unexpected fatherhood and poverty. Springsteen delivers songs like this and Point Blank like perfect short stories, bruised, sparse and dark. They will live on without him. But tonight, life and energy endure. For the last hour, the stadium lights are set to full beam, as Thunder Road and Born to Run blare out like clarion calls. The Isley Brothers\u2019 Shout and Bobby Jean end the main set, with their leader crying out \u201cOne more time! One more time!\u201d like a demon possessed. It\u2019s a madness, really, rock stardom, just like dressing up as Father Christmas in May. But if this isn\u2019t magic, then nothing else is.",
