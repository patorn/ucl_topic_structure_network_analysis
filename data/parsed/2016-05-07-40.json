  "body": "Claudio Ranieri may have achieved his first top-tier title in three decades in management but the man who helped inspire Leicester has admitted a tough start to his career in Italy nearly made him give up coaching. With the Premier League trophy in his hands, Ranieri buried the notion he was eternally the bridesmaid after second-place finishes at Roma, Juventus and Monaco. The 64-year-old Italian\u2019s first teams were the amateur side Vigor Lamezia in Calabria in 1986 and then Puteolana near Naples, and he considered packing the job in, only to be saved by an outbreak of player power and a measure of good fortune.   Related: Leicester City\u2019s triumph: the inside story of an extraordinary season | Stuart James    \u201cYes of course,\u201d said Ranieri when asked if had contemplated his future outside football. \u201cAt the beginning at Puteolana and Lamezia, I was top of the league without losing any match but there was something strange that I didn\u2019t like \u2013 I don\u2019t want to tell you what \u2013 and I said: \u2018Bye bye, I\u2019m going home.\u2019 And I left. The second year started more or less the same. I took a little team [Puteolana] in Serie C without players: I played one match with 10 players, if I remember well, not 11. \u201cBut you know, something strange arrived and they sacked me. And I said: \u2018This is not my job, I love the pitch, I love football but there is so much politics and I am not a politics man. I\u2019m a clear man.\u2019 So I said: \u2018It\u2019s not my job.\u2019 Then they sacked again the other two coaches. And they also changed the owner. And the owner called me back to finish the season. They were already relegated but the players said: \u2018We want Claudio again.\u2019 And then I was waiting and suddenly I received a call from Cagliari because we beat Cagliari \u2013 it as a little team against a giant because Cagliari was a big team for Serie C \u2013 and from that, easy!\u201d When Ranieri arrived at Leicester last July there was a widespread perception his time as a top-flight manager had passed after a miserable period as manager of the Greek national team. But Ranieri said his lowest point came when at Valencia in 2005. \u201cSomebody said to me \u2018the worst moment was Greece\u2019 but no, the worst moment was the second year in Valencia. I said to [the] owner and sporting director: \u2018This will be a hard, hard season because this season achieved something more than is possible.\u2019 They won the title in Spain, the Uefa Cup under [Rafael] Ben\u00edtez and now it will be a very difficult season. They said: \u2018Now we bring you back to Valencia because everyone loves you.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Yes but you have help me.\u2019 [They said:] \u2018Yes Claudio, yes Claudio.\u2019 Then sack Claudio.\u201d           Christian Fuchs soaks Claudio Ranieri with champagne",
