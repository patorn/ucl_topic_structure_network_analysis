  "body": "Hidden Killers of the Post-War Home 8pm, BBC4 \u201cNever had it so good\u201d? If you join Dr Suzannah Lipscomb on this look at\u00a0the\u00a0hazards of the 1950s\u00a0house, then you\u2019ll start to wonder. It\u2019s a few minutes before anyone says \u201chealth and safety\u201d but that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here. Sofas with foam interiors. Clothing made from man-made fibres \u2026 It\u2019s all a fire risk! It\u2019s the chemistry set segment, however, that shows how toys contributed \u2013 literally \u2013 to a postwar boom. John\u00a0Robinson Deadly Game: Killers in the Making 8pm, Nat Geo Wild Many wild mammals start off as cubs so cute it\u2019s a surprise they aren\u2019t all used to advertise price-comparison websites. What turns them into killing machines? Blame pushy parents, as gruelling bare-paw boot camps aim to turn the furriest into the furious. Polar bear cubs may melt icy hearts and baby cheetahs resemble a Toys R Us top seller, but it\u2019s soon clear that the transition from doe-eyed to deadly can be a quick one. Mark Gibbings-Jones The Making of an Ice\u00a0Princess 9pm, BBC2 Eleven-year-old Lily Matthias dreams of skating glory. Trying to make those dreams come true involves sacrifices. And not just for Lily, but for mum, Lyndsey \u2013 who gets up at 4am six days a week to drive Lily to training \u2013 and dad, Wayne, who spends vast sums on lessons, costumes and competition fees. This film follows Lily, plus fellow skaters Mia Gallacher and Genevieve Somerville, as they prepare for the British championships. Jonathan\u00a0Wright Boris v Dave: The Battle for Europe 9pm, Channel 4 The parallel backstories of the most notable frenemies in British politics have underpinned the EU referendum debate ever since Boris Johnson came out for Brexit earlier this spring. The ever-mischievous Michael Crick explores Johnson and Cameron\u2019s ongoing joust, which has edged away from unease and towards outright rancour in recent weeks. Civil war is currently all the rage in British politics and this battle is more entertaining than most. Phil\u00a0Harrison Going Going Gone: Nick Broomfield\u2019s Disappearing Britain 9pm, BBC4 \u201cTempus Fugit\u201d reads the legend on the Cardiff Coal Exchange\u2019s clock. But has time finally run out for Edwin Seward\u2019s 1883 landmark? Nick Broomfield,\u00a0trusty sound boom in hand, profiles this seemingly condemned building \u2013 along with the once-magnificent but now faded Wellington Rooms in Liverpool, where Broomfield made his first-ever documentary. A poignant, urgent two-parter infused with crusading spirit. Ali\u00a0Catterall Secret Life of the Human Pups 10pm, Channel 4 Supposedly, more than 10,000 Brits like to unwind by yelping, growling, licking and sniffing, doggy-style. This documentary investigates a growing subculture that mixes standard BDSM (cast your eyes below the puppy masks and there\u2019s a lot of buffed Latex and studded black leather) with a cuter, fluffier way to escape adult stresses and responsibilities. But what do the pups\u2019 friends and families think of their spare-time identities? Jack Seale Russell Howard\u2019s Stand Up Central 10pm, Comedy Central Ostensibly, with his middle-of-the-road material and a giggling studio audience, there\u2019s little to differentiate the Bristolian comic\u2019s show from many others that have come before. What is different about Howard, however, is his willingness to share the stage with comics of all stripes. As the second series kicks off, up-and-comer Darren Harriott talks being mistaken for a terrorist, while Jimmy Carr brings his trademark one-liners. Hannah J Davies Film choice The World\u2019s End (Edgar Wright, 2013) 9pm, Film4 Simon Pegg is fortysomething waster Gary King, who lures four old school pals \u2013 Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan \u2013 out of dull suburbia to complete the legendary pub crawl they failed to finish 20 years before. But the lads\u2019 night out turns into a home counties version of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers in a very funny, observant tale of redemption, aliens and beer \u2013 the final part of Wright and Pegg\u2019s Cornetto trilogy. Paul Howlett Amelia (Mira Nair, 2009) 1.15am, Channel 4 Monsoon Wedding director Mira Nair\u2019s biography of the \u201cfirst lady of the air\u201d has Hilary Swank in full flight as Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. There\u2019s a low-key authenticity to Swank\u2019s performance, and to the film, which focuses (with verbatim radio transmissions) on her final, fatal flight in 1937, when she disappeared somewhere over the Pacific. PH Live sport Tennis: The French Open The fourth day\u2019s play from Roland Garros in Paris. 9.30am, ITV4 Women\u2019s Super League Football: Chelsea v Sunderland Coverage of the FA WSL 1 encounter from Wheatsheaf Park. 7.15pm, BT Sport 1 Championship Rugby Union: Bristol v Doncaster Knights The second leg of the play-off final. The Premiership awaits. 7.30pm, Sky Sports 1",
