Nadiya Savchenko was met by Ukraine\u2019s president at Kiev\u2019s Borispol airport, where she made a passionate speech sarcastically thanking those \u201cwho had wished me evil\u201d. \u201cThrough you I survived,\u201d she said. Savchenko, who was exchanged for two Russian intelligence operatives held by Ukraine, thanked her supporters, and promised to fight for the release of other Ukrainians in Russian jails. In Kiev, she appeared with the president, Petro Poroshenko. \u201cJust as we brought back Nadiya, so we will bring back the Donbas [region in eastern Ukraine] and bring back Crimea,\u201d Poroshenko said. He vowed to secure the release of all Ukrainians held in Russia and what he called \u201coccupied territories\u201d. Savchenko paid tribute to \u201call those who had died for our Ukraine\u201d. Flanked by her mother and sister and holding a Ukrainian flag, she posed for a photo.       Her return was celebrated in Ukraine, where she is viewed as a national hero and possible future political leader. It also marks a significant moment of detente between Moscow and Kiev, and a breakthrough in on-off diplomatic negotiations conducted in Minsk. The prisoner swap comes a few weeks before the European Union decides whether to extend sanctions against Russia, imposed following Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and his covert invasion of eastern Ukraine.   Related: 'I will return home, dead or alive,' says Ukrainian pilot on trial in Russia    Quoting unnamed sources, Kommersant newspaper reported that the exchange was agreed late on Monday during a telephone conversation between Putin, Poroshenko, Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Russian media said a special presidential plane sent by Putin took off from Kiev to Moscow with Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Alexander Alexandrov on board. They both told Reuters in interviews last year they were Russian special forces soldiers who were captured while carrying out a secret operation in the rebel-held Donbas region.         Nadiya Savchenko is surrounded by media as she arrives in Ukraine     The plane arrived back at Moscow\u2019s Vnukovo airport on Wednesday afternoon, where the two men were reunited with their wives. Putin \u201chad signed an order to pardon pilot Savchenko\u201d, Russian media reported.  The president said on state TV that he hoped the prisoner exchange would reduce tensions in the Donbas region. \u201cI hope \u2026 it will lead to a reduction in fighting in the well-known conflict zone and will help avoid similarly horrible and unnecessary losses,\u201d Putin said. Earlier, Savchenko\u2019s lawyer, Mark Feygin, confirmed she was on her way home. He wrote on Twitter: \u201cTwo years ago I promised Ukrainians I would do everything possible to free Nadiya \u2026 I know how to keep my word. She\u2019s heading home, to Ukraine.\u201d       Savchenko, a military pilot, volunteered to fight with a ground unit against pro-Moscow separatists who launched an insurrection in eastern Ukraine against Kiev\u2019s pro-western government. She was captured and put on trial in southern Russia, charged with complicity in the deaths of Russian journalists who were killed by artillery while covering the conflict.  A Russian court in March sentenced her to 22 years in jail. While in Russian jail, she was elected a member of the Ukrainian parliament and is widely regarded in Ukraine as a symbol of resistance against Russia. Feygin tweeted on Wednesday that Savchenko was innocent of any crime, saying she had nothing to do with the deaths of the two journalists, Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin, who were working for state TV. Putin said he had pardoned Savchenko following a request from the journalists\u2019 families.       Her release is a boost for Poroshenko, whom critics accuse of failing to tackle Ukraine\u2019s endemic corruption or to confront entrenched oligarchic interests. In April, Poroshenko, a multimillionaire businessman, appeared in the Panama Papers in connection with an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Opposition activists in Russia welcomed the prisoner exchange. Dmitry Gudkov, the lone liberal opposition deputy in Russia\u2019s parliament, argued that if Russia had exchanged Savchenko earlier, Alexandrov\u2019s Ukrainian defence lawyer, Yury Grabovsky, might not have been murdered near Kiev in March.  \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have embarrassed ourselves before the whole world with the \u2018trial\u2019 of a deputy of the Rada and Pace. There wouldn\u2019t have been another split in society over an artificial propaganda story,\u201d Gudkov wrote on Facebook, referring to the fact that Savchenko was elected to the Ukrainian parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe during her imprisonment. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing both sides had enough political will for the exchange. People shouldn\u2019t be hostages,\u201d the opposition Parnas party member Andrei Pivovarov wrote on Twitter. But not all Russian politicians greeted the reports so warmly. Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the upper house of parliament, insisted that Savchenko not been exchanged but transferred to Ukraine under existing prisoner transfer agreements, RIA Novosti reported. She said history would find Savchenko guilty. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad for a country where they make national heroes out of representatives of radical nationalist organisations, people with blood on their hands, accomplices to fascists,\u201d Matviyenko said. \u201cAs for Savchenko, there\u2019s no reason to make her a national hero because it\u2019s been proved by a Russian court that she was guilty in the deaths of Russian journalists, among other things.\u201d Ukrainian politicians were ecstatic. The MP Alyona Shkrum wrote on Twitter that Savchenko\u2019s mother was complaining that she had not had time to cook a pot of borscht for her daughter\u2019s arrival.
