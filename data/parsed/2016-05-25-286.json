Known in Helmand by her nom de guerre \u2013 Hajani \u2013 54-year-old Firoza fought for years to repel the militants from Sistani, in Marjah district, commanding a unit of the US-backed government militia called the Afghan Local Police (ALP). During the war, in which she lost three of her six adult sons, she armed most of her male family members, including two children. The eldest, Nabi*, a shy boy with bags under his eyes, echoes his grandmother. \u201cThe enemy killed my father so I am also fighting,\u201d he says.   Related: UK firm 'employed former child soldiers' as mercenaries in Iraq    According to Firoza, the government pays Nabi the standard 9,500 afghanis (\u00a3100) local police salary; his younger brother, Habib, is not paid. Firoza says Nabi is 18. Many Afghans don\u2019t know their age, but that claim seems improbable. Face smooth, voice unbroken, he looks perhaps 14. Firoza says she gave her grandsons weapons five years ago. Despite government pledges to rid its armed forces of children, a growing number of minors are recruited to fight in the intensifying war, according to experts. The UN verified 48 boys recruited to fight last year, more than double the number for 2014. Yet the real number is certainly much higher, given the limited access around the country. The government forces, including the ALP, receive much of their funding from international partners. The UK has committed \u00a370m annually until at least next year. The US Defense Department alone funds the ALP with about $120m (\u00a380m) a year. Firoza assumed command of the ALP in Sistani when her husband was removed from duty several years ago. Once in charge, she asked the government for reinforcements. Turned down, she armed 40 members of her family, she says. Even some of the youngest, though not armed, were useful. A six-year-old boy walked between checkpoints with a flashlight to keep soldiers awake, Firoza says. When the Taliban advanced earlier this year, Firoza relocated to a small base in Helmand\u2019s provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. For two days after their escape, her grandsons didn\u2019t speak, she says. The six-year-old, who, along with some unarmed female family members, was at the house when the Taliban came, recounts how one Taliban fighter had asked him: \u201cWhere is Hajani? We want to cut off her head.\u201d Firoza agrees that her grandchildren are too young for war. \u201cBut they fight to avenge their father. When they see other children with fathers, they become very sad and want to take revenge,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody wants a good life in peace. But when you\u2019re on the frontline, do you stay silent? We\u2019re compelled to fight.\u201d She says the government has never told her not to use children. \u201cThey can tell me that the day they are able to provide security,\u201d she says. The war is taking a mounting toll on children. Close to one in three of those killed and injured are now children. Most of them are bystanders, but not all. In February, the Taliban killed Wasil Ahmad, a 10-year-old boy fighting in his uncle\u2019s local police unit in Uruzgan. After this killing, the interior ministry stressed that the boy was not an ALP employee. But that distinction is irrelevant, says Danielle Bell, human rights director for the UN in Afghanistan. \u201cWhether children are part of a security force, formally or informally, they are still being denied access to education, and to the normal life to which they are entitled,\u201d Bell said.

But Afghanistan is not on the list. Despite several requests, the US State Department did not explain this. In an email, a spokesperson said: \u201cThe department has not included Afghanistan on the CSPA list based on its assessment of the relevant facts under the legislation.\u201d   Related: When will the UK stand up to save education from bullets and bombs? | Martin Bell    The omission of Afghanistan was criticised by Charu Lata Hogg of Child Soldiers International in a recent editorial: \u201cExcluding the recruitment and use of children by Afghan police forces from the CSPA listing mechanism is inconsistent with international humanitarian and human rights laws.\u201d According to Brigadier General Charles H Cleveland, spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan, recruitment of children has picked up partly because the US military, after the troop withdrawal, can\u2019t monitor as thoroughly as before. \u201cThere was a period where we didn\u2019t get our hands into the ALP,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got less than 15,000 people here, you don\u2019t have the same visibility of what\u2019s going on in the country.\u201d He said the US had told the Afghan government \u201cto go through a rigorous vetting process\u201d. The Afghan government denies using child soldiers, telling the Guardian that the ministry of interior has completed two recent assessments of the ALP.  \u201cWith completion of these assessments, we are confident that young people under age 18 are not recruited and even under difficult circumstances they will not be recruited or paid by [the ministry of the interior],\u201d said Sediq Seddiqi, a ministry spokesman.  The reasons behind child recruitment are complex, ranging from patriotism and honour to financial hardship and exploitation. Children are not always armed with parental consent. Bilal Siddiqui, head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission in Helmand, said parents had complained to him of police commanders hiring their children without informing them.  For Firoza, fighting is a family duty. At the moment, though, the relative calm of Lashkar Gah has allowed for some normality in her grandchildren\u2019s lives. \u201cAt the moment, they go to school,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if we have to go back to Marjah, of course they will take up weapons again.\u201d *Names have been changed to protect identities \u2022 This article was amended on 27 May. The original stated that the UN identified a total of 43 boys recruited to fight in Afghanistan in 2015. The UN has confirmed that the correct number is in fact 48.",
