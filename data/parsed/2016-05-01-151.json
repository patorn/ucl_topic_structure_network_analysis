  "body": "If you were dropped into the middle of a conversation with Alan Cumming, this is how it might flow: \u201cYou know Geraldine James? Every time we see her\u2026 what\u2019s that movie she\u2019s in? 45 Years! With Charlotte Rampling \u2013 so nice to see a movie where they don\u2019t cut back and forth all the time, and you get to watch people rather than being bombarded. Anyway, every time we see Geraldine James we go: \u2018Would you like a bacon sandwich?\u2019, because years ago I saw The Jewel in the Crown, and there\u2019s a bit where she\u2019s just had an affair with someone, and she comes out the next morning and says: \u2018Would you like a bacon sandwich?\u2019\u201d He chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ve always had shorthand ways to remind Grant [Cumming\u2019s husband] who people are, and she\u2019s Bacon Sandwich,\u201d he explains, before dashing on. \u201cThere are some hilarious ones\u2026 who was I doing the other day? He\u2019s British, said he didn\u2019t like Madonna, and told a story about getting peed on.\u201d I never do find out who was peed on because Cumming is rhapsodising on the vegan butcher he visited in Minnesota while touring his Sappy Songs roadshow. \u201cThey had this Porterhouse steak and I got some Canadian ham, and there\u2019s these Korean spare ribs, delicious \u2013 they\u2019ve got a slightly chewy texture.\u201d Talking to Cumming is like being inside his head, a fizzing ball of enquiry ping-ponging from subject to subject \u2013 his ardent support for Bernie Sanders, the time he was replaced in a sci-fi movie by Dame Judi Dench (\u201cI said: \u2018That bitch is always getting my roles\u2019\u201d), and why he only accepted a career-changing part in The Good Wife \u201cabsolutely under duress\u201d. It\u2019s a quality that helped make his 2014 memoir Not My Father\u2019s Son oddly exhilarating in spite of its poignant tale of a merciless, philandering father so bent on tormenting his sons that Cumming has \u201cnot one memory from our childhoods that is not clouded by fear or humiliation or pain\u201d. He writes like he talks, in a no-holds-barred rush of observation and confession. It\u2019s why he enjoys touring the country singing, because for once he\u2019s not acting. \u201cI love the connection you get with the audience. There\u2019s nothing like it.\u201d He rolls up his sleeve to reveal a tattoo on his arm of EM Forster\u2019s famous line from Howard\u2019s End: \u201cOnly Connect.\u201d Sometimes he\u2019ll grab a phone or camera from someone in the audience and delete what they\u2019ve been recording, because that\u2019s not connection.     \u2018In Cabaret, I was a semi-clad pixie that was sexually ambiguous, European and weird\u2019: Alan Cumming gets to grips with himself. Photograph: Phillip Toledano for the Observer    \u201cOf course you\u2019re going to record me and take a photo when I\u2019m doing a concert. But don\u2019t be sitting a metre away from me, holding your arm like that\u2026\u201d He mimes a camera in his face. \u201cI had this epiphany,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have to take my photo with everybody who asks. When you\u2019re picking up your dog\u2019s poop and someone says: \u2018Can I have a photo?\u2019 and I say: \u2018I have shit in my hands\u2019 and they go: \u2018Oh, once you put it in the bin, can I have a photo?\u2019 I will say no.\u201d He says Americans sometimes seemed shocked by his frankness, but frankness is part of his appeal. He once took a neon pen to the wall of his London flat and wrote out Roosevelt\u2019s Depression-era mantra \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d a principle he seems determined to live by.    I don\u2019t have to have my photo taken with everybody who asks. There are times when I say no    There is one particularly vivid scene in Not My Father\u2019s Son in which the 13-year-old Cumming buys a dinner service from a stand at the Angus Show in Arbroath. It is cold and damp, as it often is in Scotland, and his father has disappeared with a woman he has accidentally on purpose run into. Alone, shivering in the smirr, Cumming bids for the crockery. It is \u201cbeige and bland with 70s-style flowers printed on every plate, bowl and cup,\u201d but to the young boy it represents escape. \u201cI would be eating off them in a place where there were buses and taxis and where I would never have to wait in a public place for hours, cold and damp, wondering if my father had concluded his liaison.\u201d That dinner service, or pieces of it, survived for many years, until Cumming moved to New York and the promise it embodied was well and truly met. This summer he will perform at the Festival in Edinburgh, the city where it all began for him 32 years ago as one half of the trendy Kelvinside thespians Victor & Barry (Forbes Masson played Victor). But first there\u2019s a movie to film, After Louie, more concert dates, another book to complete (You\u2019ve Got to Get Bigger Dreams) and the small matter of an iconic TV series to wrap up. On 1 January 2010, Alan Cumming made his New Year\u2019s resolutions. \u201cOne of them was to wear more suits,\u201d he recalls. A week later he was offered the role of Eli Gold, the strait-laced political strategist on The Good Wife, then in its first season. \u201cI was like: \u2018What? You\u2019re casting me?\u201d recalls Cumming. \u201cI\u2019d never really played a human being before, much less a middle-aged man in a suit.\u201d     Double take: Cumming embraces his smart new self. Photograph: Phillip Toledano for the Observer    It\u2019s safe to say that Cumming was probably not the only one to puzzle over the casting director\u2019s instincts. He\u2019d rocketed to fame in the US in Sam Mendes\u2019s 1998 Broadway revival of Cabaret, playing the emcee \u2013 a \u201csemi-clad sexy pixie that was sexually ambiguous, and European, and weird,\u201d in Cumming\u2019s words. The performance won him a Tony, and the roles that followed were a grab bag of hits and misses that played on his outsized personality, from a comic villain in Spy Kids to the voice of Persnikitty in Garfield: The Movie, and Gutsy Smurf in The Smurfs. Evidently European, weird, and sexually ambiguous was fertile ground for Cumming.    I was like: \u2018What? You\u2019re casting me?\u2019 I\u2019d never really played a human being before    The Good Wife, a sophisticated courtroom drama, was different. Loosely inspired by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general forced out of office by a sex scandal in March 2008, it follows the career of a disgraced politician\u2019s wife, Alicia Florrick played by Julianna Margulies, as she rebuilds her life. Eli Gold is the blustering Machiavellian fixer who connives to resurrect the political career of her husband, Peter Florrick. Ever since its premiere in 2009, The Good Wife has been celebrated as a paragon of network television, mostly for not resembling network television \u2013 the shows of which can be predictable, simplistic, safe. The Good Wife, by contrast, is complex, compelling, casually cynical at a time when there\u2019s much to be cynical about. But in January 2010 Cumming was not convinced the show would survive the ruthless economies of the slash-and-burn networks. And he had Burlesque to film with Cher. A one-episode gig with a CBS legal soap didn\u2019t cut it, so he turned it down. His agents pushed him to reconsider. \u201cThey said: \u2018We really think this could be good for you \u2013 they might ask you to do more,\u2019\u201d Cumming recalls. Grudgingly he relented. It may have been the smartest about-turn he will ever make. One episode led to another, and then another, and before long he was a \u201cseries regular\u201d, as they say in the trade, often stealing the best lines of the show. The Good Wife not only beamed him into the living rooms of America, it earned him two Emmy nominations in five seasons. Cumming joined a rich ensemble that included old pros such as Christine Baranksi, Michael J Fox and Stockard Channing, but also some talented newcomers like Archie Panjabi and Mamie Gummer. \u201cI always think that\u2019s why you pay your agents and managers all that money,\u201d he muses. \u201cBecause sometimes they give really good advice.\u201d     Song and dance: on stage in Cabaret. Photograph: Getty Images    But The Good Wife is ending, after seven seasons. Cumming has appeared in all of them. The upcoming finale, which will be shown on 8 May, has fans in suspense as 157 episodes of history catch up with Alicia Florrick and her husband. When I tell Cumming I\u2019m devastated by the impending absence in my life, he scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d He\u2019s right, of course \u2013 it\u2019s just television. And yet great television leaves a void in its wake. Like The Sopranos, which it resembles in several key ways, the writers have invested as much energy in character studies as in plot development. We\u2019ve come to know these people onscreen in ways that feel intimate. We\u2019ll miss them. Like The Sopranos, too, The Good Wife is morally ambivalent, a harder ground to occupy in network TV, which tends to be didactic. \u201cWhy I think it\u2019s popular, and why I think it\u2019s so good, and why I\u2019m really proud to be in it, is that it doesn\u2019t tell you what to think,\u201d says Cumming, referring to the show\u2019s formula of taking a toxic social issue, such as abortion, and challenging consensus views on the right and the left. That ambivalence extends to the characters, too. \u201cI mean, Alicia is turning into this kind of bitch,\u201d says Cumming. \u201cSo it\u2019s constantly challenging your allegiances and changing the partisan nature of these TV shows. People you really like do terrible things.\u201d Or as New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum, shrewdly pointed out in a review of season six: \u201cOn The Good Wife, there is no success without corruption. The higher Alicia climbs, the more compromised she becomes, and the more at ease with compromise.\u201d Nevertheless Cumming has been ready to move on for a while. \u201cI\u2019m over it,\u201d he says. \u201cI was going to leave last year. I said: \u2018I\u2019m bored. I do the same thing again and again. There\u2019s only so many ways I can raise my eyebrows. I was talking to my team. I said that I feel like all I do is come into the room and go: \u2018Alicia, what the hell is going on?\u2019 and literally the next day I got the script and the first line was: \u2018Alicia, what the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d     \u2018Why I think The Good Wife is so good is that it doesn\u2019t tell you what to think\u2019: with Julianna Margulies in The Good Wife. Photograph: Getty Images    Not that Cumming isn\u2019t thrilled for the ways The Good Wife has enriched his life. He knows shows like that don\u2019t come along often. You sense it in the sheer energy and enthusiasm and fulfilment that emanates from him. \u201cThe show has changed both my perception and the world\u2019s perception of me as an actor,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause now I can play men in suits. I\u2019ve become a grown-up.\u201d Alan Cumming wears maroon suit by Valentino; shirt by Sandro; palm tree bomber by Paul Smith; shirt by Jil Sander; and tie by Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane.
