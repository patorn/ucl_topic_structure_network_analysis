  "body": "Bath have reacted to their disappointing season by parting company with their coach, Mike Ford. The former England assistant coach had three more years left on his contract but the club\u2019s owner, Bruce Craig, has lost patience after his team finished a lowly ninth in the Premiership and failed to qualify for the European Champions\u2019 Cup. Only a year ago Ford\u2019s Bath were in the Premiership final and playing some exhilarating rugby. As recently as a few days ago Ford was adamant he had Craig\u2019s support but the club have also had to deal with a clutch of off-field issues as well as the fallout from Sam Burgess\u2019s decision to return to Australian rugby league.   Related: European Champions Cup awards: our writers on the 2015-16 season    Ford\u2019s abrupt departure will inevitably raise a question mark over the future at the club of his son, George. The England fly-half is also contracted for another two years but the apparent breakdown in trust between Craig and his father leaves him in an awkward position. In a statement Bath said they were \u201creviewing\u201d their coaching set-up for next season and would be \u201cmaking an announcement in due course\u201d. The names of Glasgow\u2019s highly rated Gregor Townsend, the unattached former England coach Stuart Lancaster and even one of his distant predecessors, Sir Clive Woodward, will be among those bandied about as potential successors but whoever takes over should not expect a job for life. Since Craig bought the club in 2010 he has got rid of four coaches, with Steve Meehan, Sir Ian McGeechan, Gary Gold and Ford having moved on. \u201cHe wants us to be the best club side in Europe and he\u2019s very committed to that,\u201d Ford said earlier this month. There have been mutterings of dressing-room disquiet for some time, with the Burgess saga and the absence of the club\u2019s World Cup players having complicated the early stages of the season. In recent weeks the Japanese No8 Amanaki Mafi left the club amid reports of a bust-up and the Samoan international flanker Alafoti Fa\u2019osiliva has been released after receiving a suspended prison sentence for assaulting a university student. Ford, even so, has been busy recruiting players for next season, with the Welsh internationals Toby Faletau and Luke Charteris signed up, and expressed confidence he would be allowed to turn things around. \u201cIt hurts and we need to use that feeling as motivation this summer,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cI am old and ugly enough to know what will happen if we carry on losing next year. I am not stupid but there is no way I expect us to be in that position next year. \u201cWe need to be the hunters again and get our hunger back because we\u2019ve not won anything over the past three years. Clearly we\u2019ve got to improve. There were a lot of things that weren\u2019t good enough this year. Looking back I should have ripped it up after we lost the Premiership final last season. But there was a World Cup and players were away. We got ourselves into a hole that we couldn\u2019t get out of.\u201d It may be that, with Bath\u2019s forwards coach, Neal Hatley, having opted to join England, Craig did not see much point in hiring an assistant coach from the southern hemisphere to fix a problem while retaining the incumbent head coach above him. He will also have looked enviously at Saracens\u2019 success in Saturday\u2019s Champions\u2019 Cup final and wondered how Bath can best compete with a young squad with the clear ability to improve further. Jake White\u2019s success in steering Montpellier to the Challenge Cup title may also have caught the Francophile Craig\u2019s eye, along with Pat Lam\u2019s efforts at Connacht, and it would be no surprise if he goes for a southern hemisphere coach, preferably with international experience. The boom-and-bust cycle of Bath\u2019s previous appointments suggests simply appointing a new man to the coach\u2019s tracksuit will not instantly solve everything. Ford, who spent four years at the club, three of them as coach, is almost certain to pop up again elsewhere, having previously coached in union with Ireland and Saracens in addition to a lengthy stint as England\u2019s defence coach. His dreams of leading Bath back to former glories, however, are over.",
