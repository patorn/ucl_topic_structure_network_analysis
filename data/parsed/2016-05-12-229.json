Related: Rester Vertical review \u2013 exercise in myth-making and sexual adventure fails to stay upright    The French film-maker, whose last film Stranger by the Lake focused on a gay men\u2019s cruising spot, spoke at a press conference at this year\u2019s festival to remark on the importance of showing both sides of sex on-screen. While the majority of his previous films have focused on gay relationships, Rester Vertical runs the gamut as a mysterious screenwriter with an interest in wolves begins a relationship with a young shepherdess while also lusting after a local young man and having a sexual liaison with an older man along the way. \u201cAfter Stranger by the Lake, it\u2019s not a question of looking more into women,\u201d he said. \u201cSex is more important than sexuality. It\u2019s a world of pleasure but sex can also be a world of suffering. Sometimes sex is scary. It\u2019s the origin of the world and maybe the end of the world too.\u201d            Early reactions from the film are mixed. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called it \u201cthe first auteur turkey\u201d of the festival while the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Boyd van Hoeij described it as a \u201cdelightfully queer oddity\u201d. The critical divide comes as little surprise, given its bizarre content, ranging from a scene of \u201csexual euthanasia\u201d to a live birth, close up. The latter is a moment that Guiraudie chose to avoid himself for a surprising reason. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many women who would agree to have these images used on the big screen,\u201d he said. \u201cI was actually outside the delivery room. If I\u2019d have been in there, it would have been more complicated. It would have been more violent.\u201d Rester Vertical\u2019s almost dream-like logic means that it\u2019s less likely to breakout than his previous film (Stranger by the Lake received eight Cesar nominations) but Guiraudie was keen on keeping things unconventional.   Related: Sieranevada review \u2013 food for thought (but not for the mourners) in Romanian oddity    \u201cI wanted the film to be somewhere between reality and a legend,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t design the film in a very set way. I didn\u2019t write things in chronological order. I didn\u2019t want to make a narrative film. I like to play with what is plausible and implausible.\u201d Rester Vertical is screening in competition alongside new films from Sean Penn, the Dardenne brothers and Paul Verhoeven.",
