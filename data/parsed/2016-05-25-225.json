  "body": "One of the many delights of the most recent Premier League season was the refreshingly scant focus on \u201cmind games\u201d, the media concept which seeks to elevate low-level managerial arsery to the complex heights of cold war brinkmanship. Ah well. It was nice while it lasted. The advent of Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to Manchester threatens to create the event horizon of mind games, a black hole of artless man-baiting, into which all rational commentary will be terminally sucked. Premier League convention demands the bigger plotlines are described as \u201cShakespearean\u201d, and I note that even before the United appointment has been formalised, this was already the case with the Guardiolas and the Mourinhos. Two households \u2013 not entirely alike in dignity, it must be said \u2013 in fair Manchester where we lay our scene. And from ancient strife is widely expected to break forth new mutiny (though at the age of 13, Marius Guardiola is at least too young to find star-crossed love with 19-year-old Matilde Mourinho).   Related: Eric Cantona: \u2018I love Jos\u00e9 Mourinho but he is not Manchester United\u2019    Spanish sports newspaper Marca has already depicted Pep and Jos\u00e9 standing back to back with 18th-century duelling pistols. This feels faintly refined, considering that Mourinho\u2019s most famous move on a member of the Barcelona coaching staff would have been outlawed even in MMA. \u201cA United manager wouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d opined Bobby Charlton of the eye gouging, back when Man U were still affecting to be not that kind of girl. Still, someone once said that all villains are just victims whose stories have yet to be told, so perhaps Mourinho\u2019s United tenure will see the belated reveal of an origin story that finally explains him sympathetically. If not, we may assume that the muscle memory of \u201cmind games\u201d will simply take over. This, certainly as far as Mourinho and Guardiola\u2019s earlier period of co-orbit was concerned, consisted chiefly of Mourinho baiting Guardiola relentlessly for months until the latter finally unleashed a 45-minute monologue at the Bernab\u00e9u on the eve of the 2011 Champions League semi-final. Only for a reporter to ask the inevitable of the Barcelona coach: was it a mind game? \u201cWhat?\u201d scoffed an exasperated Guardiola. \u201cYou think my players will run around more because I looked for Mourinho\u2019s camera?\u201d Many may be looking forward to a Manchester revival of this attritional antagonism; I envy them their endurance. If only we could move into an era of managers who ostentatiously acknowledge each other as worthy foes. You know the sort of thing: despite being engaged in mortal combat, both adversaries still find time to praise the other\u2019s technique. The wryest example comes in The Princess Bride, where the duel between Inigo Montoya and the Man in Black is punctuated by the opponents marvelling cordially at one another\u2019s skills. \u201cYou are wonderful!\u201d says Inigo as he lunges at the Man in Black. \u201cThank you,\u201d replies the latter as he parries expertly, \u201cI have worked hard to become so.\u201d \u201cI admit it, you are better than I am.\u201d \u201cThen why are you smiling?\u201d \u201cBecause I know something you do not know.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d \u201cI am not left-handed.\u201d With a few small adjustments, this kind of absurdly mannered reverence for each other would form a far more satisfactory basis for the remote press conference duelling between Guardiola and Mourinho, and have just as much potential to fry the other\u2019s brain. It would certainly be more bearable for the rest of us. Instead of detonating some spiteful depth charge, I should like to see the Portuguese affect a tone of scrupulous admiration. \u201cI would sooner destroy a stained glass window than get him the sack,\u201d he might muse of his rival across town. \u201cHowever, since I can\u2019t have him catching me on points, I\u2019m going to have to park my bus.\u201d For his part, Guardiola could simply fall back on Sherlock Holmes\u2019s description of his worthy foe Moriarty when describing the United manager. \u201cHe is the organiser of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, and abstract thinker \u2026\u201d Yes, I dream of a Reichenbach Derby. But my expectations are set for another El Crassico. Great British Cycling bully-off continues And so to the nagging question about British Cycling: why must bullying allegations attend it at every turn? Even the attempt to dictate a party line on the recent bullying allegations has itself drawn bullying allegations. The Times reports that in the wake of Shane Sutton\u2019s departure as technical director and the revelation that cyclist Simon Yates had tested positive for a banned substance, Sutton\u2019s replacement emailed all riders. \u201cYou are free to say yes or no to interviews,\u201d they were told by Andy Harrison, \u201cbut how you respond will be a big factor in our ability to support you as the season unfolds.\u201d Lest the point remained opaque, the email reiterated: \u201cIt is highly likely that you will be asked for a comment over the weekend. As stated, your response will be a big factor going forward.\u201d If the import of those statements feels fairly clear to you, rest assured that British Cycling has since felt moved to stress that it was not meant to menace. It was just a \u201cpoorly constructed sentence\u201d. Hmmmm. To accidentally appear to make a threat once is certainly unfortunate. To do it twice begins to look like something else. One cyclist now tells the Times that the British Cycling set-up has become \u201cdepressing\u201d \u2013 but doubtless there is some \u201cmarginal gain\u201d to that. We must wait till Rio to discover.",
