  "body": "Liverpool have completed the signing of Loris Karius from J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s former club Mainz in \u00a34.7m deal. Klopp wants the 22-year-old goalkeeper to increase the competition with Simon Mignolet for next season. Karius, who spent time with Manchester City as a teenager, has signed a five-year contract at Anfield and will wear the No1 shirt with Mignolet happy to stick with his current No22. The German is Klopp\u2019s third signing since taking over in October, having secured deals in January for the Schalke centre-back Joel Matip and the Red Star Belgrade midfielder Marko Grujic to join this summer.

The history, everybody who plays football knows. There are a lot of things in my head when I think of this club. \u201cI spoke to the manager and I had a good feeling afterwards because he told me what he wants to do with the club and with the players. It was a good talk with him and after that I was convinced this was the right decision.\u201d The former Borussia Dortmund manager Klopp has returned to Germany for the second time to bolster his squad. \u201cI am delighted we have signed Loris, he has had a fantastic season with Mainz and has developed into a very good goalkeeper since his return to Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really pleased that we were able to move so quickly to get him and that Loris has shown such a desire to come to Liverpool with a lot of other clubs interested in him. \u201cI know he will add to the quality we have in this position and I look forward to working with him and all our players when we return for pre-season.\u201d Next on Liverpool\u2019s list of targets is the Leicester City left-back Ben Chilwell, for whom they are prepared to offer \u00a34m up front with some add-ons. Martin Skrtel looks poised to depart, with the Turkish side Besiktas leading the race for the centre-half. Kolo Tour\u00e9, whose deal expires next month, could yet earn a new short-term contract should Mamadou Sakho\u2019s failed drugs test lead to a lengthy ban. However, the promising Spanish midfielder Sergi Canos, who impressed on loan at Brentford this season and was handed his Liverpool debut in their penultimate match of the campaign, seems destined to leave this summer. It is understood the 19-year-old has told the club he wants to leave after contract negotiations stalled and, while there has been interest from clubs in Portugal, the player is keen for a permanent move to London, with Watford and Queens Park Rangers potential destinations.",
