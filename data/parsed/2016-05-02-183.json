  "body": "Lauren Slater\u2019s book of popular psychology, Opening Skinner\u2019s Box, caused a storm among the scientific community when it appeared in 2004. Its critics deplored Slater\u2019s anecdotal, semi-fictional style. Above all, the book was condemned for perpetuating \u2013 or at least failing to refute \u2013 the myth that the father of behaviourism, BF Skinner, tested his theories by keeping his infant daughter in an environmentally controlled box. One suspects that some of this ire was raised by Slater\u2019s temerity in psychologising the psychologists. But Improbable\u2019s attempt to give the book dramatic form hardly clarifies the matter, and adds another layer of obfuscation. Slater\u2019s interpretations of 10 landmark psychological experiments of the 20th century are provocative, but they lack a visual element for which even Improbable, with all its vast experience of whimsical ensemble work, cannot entirely compensate. It\u2019s predictable and only mildly amusing to watch a group of performers in ill-fitting suits and bow ties scurrying around in imitation of lab rats or rhesus monkeys in search of the buttons that will deliver a shot of morphine, or their mother\u2019s milk, or some other intermittent and random reward.     Alan Cox and Paschale Straiton in Opening Skinner\u2019s Box. Photograph: Topher McGrillis    The grim depiction of Stanley Milgram\u2019s discovery that 65% of people would deliver a supposedly fatal electric shock when ordered to do so adds a jolt. But one cannot help but feel that in opening Skinner\u2019s Box, Improbable have merely succeeded in opening a whole new can of worms. \u2022 At West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, 5-14 May.
