  "body": "On the plane to Cannes, reading Balzac, Park Chan-wook stumbled upon a passage that the director sums up as: \u201cAll great men have a very female sensitivity.\u201d \u201cAs a father \u2013 and as I grow older \u2013 I discover more of my female dimension,\u201d says the South Korean film-maker, best known in the west for his brilliantly violent \u2013 and very male \u2013 revenge fantasy Oldboy. \u201cI think it\u2019s true of all older men: they have an increasingly strong feminine side.\u201d     No octopus today \u2026 Min-sik Choi in Oldboy, 2003. Photograph: Allstar/UIP    Park is busy examining his gender fluidity because of his new film, The Handmaiden, which premiered at the Cannes film festival last week. It\u2019s based on Sarah Waters\u2019 Fingersmith, the Man Booker prize-nominated novel about a female Victorian street urchin who is tasked with winning the trust of a lady and, eventually, displacing her. Instead, the two fall in love. Park\u2019s version, transferred to 1930s Korea, maps out the same basic plot (maid meets lady, maid and lady fall for each other, double-cross each other, then reunite).     Maybe revenge is a part of me \u2026 Because it\u2019s not part of the source material    Divided, like the book, into three parts, it is a strange and sumptuous film. A romance told from both sides, in which neither can ever fully be trusted. There is betrayal and devotion and lots of explicit lesbian sex. There is, in a nod to Oldboy\u2019s cephalopod-chomping dinner scene, an octopus \u2013 a leviathan hulk (too huge to eat) that splurges from a fish tank in the antagonist\u2019s chambers. Perhaps inevitably, given it\u2019s a Park film, grisly vengeance plays a part too. \u201cMaybe revenge is a part of me. Because it\u2019s not part of the source material,\u201d says Park. An interpreter, an attentive young man clutching a yellow legal pad, has been assigned to his side. He speaks, as Park, in the third person, while the director smiles and waits for his message to get across. The process - the question, the translation, the answer, the translation, the translation of the translation - is achingly slow. If Park feels any irritation he doesn\u2019t show it. A former film critic, he is a genial interviewee, kindly even.     \u2018Some Koreans were captivated by Japan\u2019 \u2026 The Handmaiden. Photograph: PR Image    He was drawn to the book, he says, because Waters seems to share his fascination with the flesh. He recalls reading the scene in which the maid gently grinds down a tooth that is bothering the lady using a silver thumb thimble. \u201cThe sound of it grinding and the sense of the body and the proximity and the sound of their breath, how big their eyes can be \u2013 meeting and then being averted,\u201d he says. \u201cHow great would it be to see that as a film, outside the confines of the typed page?\u201d The Handmaiden is Park\u2019s first film since his English language debut, Stoker, a Hitchcock-lite thriller starring Nicole Kidman and Mia Wasikowska that disappointed critics and floundered at the box office. If The Handmaiden is a confident return to form, it\u2019s partly because it is set in a time and place that offers fertile ground for the story to take root. Park had finished the book and agreed to the film before he realised the BBC had already made a series based on the source material. He was, he says, \u201cdeflated\u201d for a while, but then saw an opportunity: this would be his chance to examine a period of his own country\u2019s history that had always intrigued him.     Vampire horror Thirst, 2009. Photograph: Allstar/FOCUS FEATURES    Korea in the 1930s and 40s was under Japanese rule. In the film, the themes of occupation and colonisation play out at a personal level. Park\u2019s maid \u2013 Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) \u2013 is Korean, the lady \u2013 Hideko (Kim Min-hee) \u2013 is Japanese. Sook-hee, ostensibly one of the oppressed, becomes the invader, seducing the occupier in the taken territory. The baddie of the piece is Hideko\u2019s uncle, an upper-class Korean intellectual who is obsessed with Japanese culture, specifically his growing collection of pornographic literature. It\u2019s housed in the Japanese half of his mansion, the other side of which has a western design. The visual split reveals the character\u2019s allegiances: to Japan, to the west, but not to Korea.    Actresses call me 'Unnie', a Korean word women use when addressing an older woman    \u201cThe intellectuals who were fascinated by Japan genuinely believed that Japanese colonial rule would last forever,\u201d says Park. This devotion to foreign rule worries him, even if \u2013 as a self-described genre film-maker \u2013 he can\u2019t help but be swayed by American cinema\u2019s tropes himself. \u201cThey admired the western culture that came in through the Japanese,\u201d he says of the 1940s Korean upper-class. \u201cSome Koreans were truly captivated by Japan. They\u2019re frightening, those people. And I wanted to look into those characters.\u201d As for the sex, it is shot stylishly and elaborately, in much the same way as Park has become known for filming violence. But, just because it\u2019s sexual, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it must be serious. \u201cRather than getting immersed in the moment, I would rather keep a certain distance and infuse elements of humour,\u201d he says, pointing to a scene in which the more experienced Sook-hee is comically shocked at the proficiency of her virgin lover. \u201cI believe that\u2019s a more adult way to handle sexual or violent situations. The humour that derives from these situations is not simply funny. There\u2019s a bitter aftertaste to it.\u201d     Avant garde \u2026 a still from The Handmaiden. Photograph: PR Image    Park, one of South Korea\u2019s biggest box-office draws, hopes the film will help his country accept homosexuality into mainstream culture. He is impressed by the indie scene\u2019s commitment to showing gay relationships on screen, but he says gay love remains \u2013 as in many parts of the world \u2013 part of an artistic niche. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the continuous efforts of indie film-makers and other campaigners that the subject of homosexuality is no longer a taboo,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s been waiting to receive the big-budget treatment and to have large-scale distribution. In that sense The Handmaiden is like avant garde cinema, paving the way for the mainstream to follow.\u201d   Related: The Handmaiden review \u2013 Park Chan-wook's lurid lesbian potboiler simmers with sexual tension    The spectre of an older male director guiding two young female actors through graphic sex scenes has lead some at Cannes to compare The Handmaiden with previous Palme d\u2019Or winner Blue is the Warmest Colour, and to criticise it in the same way. Blue\u2019s director, Abdellatif Kechiche, was letting the male gaze run riot, said some, a point that later validated by the film\u2019s stars, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux, who claimed they had been exploited during the film\u2019s \u201chorrible\u201d shoot. The Handmaiden\u2019s female stars have both said that the sex scenes were necessary for the story and no hardship to film. Exarchopoulos and Seydoux said similar things (Exarchopoulos: \u201cWe feel extremely free acting in his films, it\u2019s a wonderful trusting relationship\u201d) at the Cannes press conference in 2013, before later levelling criticisms at Kechiche. Still, according to Park, it\u2019s unlikely his actors will perform a similar manoeuvre. They trust him. He is, in a sense, he says, one of the girls. \u201cEver since Thirst [Park\u2019s 2009 vampire horror] actresses I\u2019ve worked with have called me \u201cUnnie\u201d, which is Korean word women use when addressing an older woman,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s some sort of sisterhood between us.\u201d",
