  "body": "The school uniform Nobuko Oshita made for herself looks like it would turn to dust at the slightest touch. One sleeve of what is left of her stained summer blouse is missing. A metal badge bearing the name of First Hiroshima Prefectural girls\u2019 high school is still attached to the lapel. The 13-year-old was helping with demolition work when the US B-29 bomber Enola Gay released its atomic payload over Hiroshima on the morning of 6 August 1945. Rescue workers found Oshita, barely alive, amid the rubble and took her to her parents\u2019 home, where she died that night.     Nobuko Ohshita\u2019s summer uniform.    Not far from Oshita\u2019s uniform are the blackened remains of a bento lunch that Shigeru Orimen, another Hiroshima schoolchild, would never eat. Three days passed before the 13-year-old\u2019s mother, Shigeko, found her son\u2019s charred remains, his metal lunchbox clasped to his stomach. Barack Obama has yet to decide whether exposure to the harrowing exhibits at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum will be on his itinerary when he becomes the first sitting US president to visit the city this month.      Shigeru Orimen\u2019s lunchbox.    Touring the museum \u2013 an experience his secretary of state, John Kerry, described as \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d \u2013 would bring him uncomfortably close to physical reminders of young lives ended in an instant 71 years ago, by a weapon used on the orders of a previous holder of his office. Like the dozens of schoolchildren snaking their way past the museum\u2019s exhibits one afternoon this week, he may fall silent in front of a twisted tricycle belonging to a young boy who was among the 140,000 people who died that day and in the months that followed. Obama may pause to contemplate the unforgiving force of a weapon capable of generating enough light and heat to leave the \u201cshadow\u201d of an unidentified victim etched into the stone steps of a bank. In an irony that will be lost on few residents of Hiroshima, he will be flanked, as protocol demands, by a military aide carrying a metal briefcase, covered in black leather, known as the \u201cnuclear football\u201d. Inside are the codes US presidents need to authorise a nuclear strike when they are away from established command centres such as the White House.

While there is a general acceptance that no apology is necessary \u2013 and none will be offered \u2013 Hiroshima survivors say they want Obama to leave having reaffirmed the commitment he made in Prague in 2009 to \u201ca world without nuclear weapons\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for him to apologise,\u201d said Sunao Tsuboi, a 20-year-old student on the day of the attack, who has become the public face of the hibakusha \u2013 the radiation-exposed survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Photograph: Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cThat America was the first to drop the bomb is a matter of historical fact, but if you keep insisting on an apology and it doesn\u2019t come, then how are we ever going to join hands and make progress on nuclear disarmament?\u201d added Tsuboi, who remained unconscious in hospital after the blast until more than a month after Japan\u2019s surrender on 15 August 1945. \u201cThe nuclear age came about because something had gone seriously wrong with humankind as a whole, not just with the US.\u201d As their country\u2019s leaders celebrate an unshakeable postwar military alliance, Japanese and American citizens have clung to their competing narratives over the Hiroshima bombing. In the US, it is credited with hastening the end of a war that would have killed far more American soldiers had the land battle moved to the main Japanese island of Honshu. By contrast, many Japanese view Hiroshima as an atrocity committed against a mainly civilian population, although there is recognition that the country\u2019s militarist leaders should share responsibility for the attack. \u201cBefore Obama apologises, he should acknowledge that dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a mistake \u2013 a war crime,\u201d said Tadashi Sawada, a member of the Hiroshima Alliance for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons. \u201cUnless he is prepared to do that, then I see no point in him coming. \u201cWhen he made that speech in Prague he gave a lot of people reason to be hopeful, but what has he achieved in the seven years since then? I can\u2019t help feeling that he won the Nobel peace prize on the back of a lie.\u201d Rather than court the domestic political risks implicit in attempting to explain the decision to twice use nuclear weapons against Japan, Obama will \u201cshine a spotlight on the tremendous and devastating human toll of war\u201d and \u201chonour the memory of all innocents who were lost\u201d, said Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser. There is little prospect that views on the Hiroshima bombing in the US and Japan will ever converge. But for Tsuboi, who is being treated for cancer and heart disease that he attributes to his exposure to radiation as a young man, Obama\u2019s visit should not be used as an excuse to dwell on the past.

If I get to meet him in Hiroshima, I would simply thank him for coming and tell him: \u2018We believe in you.\u2019\u201d Hiroshi Shimizu, secretary general of the biggest organisation of Hiroshima survivors, said that even as excitement builds over Obama\u2019s visit, \u201cnot everyone\u201d in the city was comfortable with the absence of an apology. \u201cMy feeling is that he\u2019s coming here to burnish his political legacy,\u201d said Shimizu. \u201cIt would have been much better if he had come here in 2009 to make his speech about a nuclear-free world. But he is a Nobel peace prize winner, so he still has a huge responsibility to follow through on his promises.\u201d Nuclear campaigners expecting even a mild show of contrition are likely to be disappointed. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, dismissed speculation that Obama would give an address similar to the one he delivered in Prague. \u201cWhen he visits Hiroshima, I would anticipate the president will have an opportunity to reflect on his time there,\u201d Earnest told reporters. \u201cBut the president does not plan to deliver a major address in Hiroshima.\u201d The passage of time has softened attitudes towards the US among the remaining survivors, according to Tsuboi. \u201cIn the past, 90% of us would have been horrified by the prospect of a visit by the US president,\u201d he said. \u201cI hated Americans for 30 years. Then I started going there and meeting people, and I realised that I had been deceived by Japanese militarism. We survivors are all getting old now, so we want to see progress towards the abolition of nuclear weapons before we die. I will repeat that demand until the day my heart stops beating.\u201d",
