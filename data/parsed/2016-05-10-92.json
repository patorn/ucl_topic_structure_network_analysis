Not only has he been elected as one of seven Ukip assembly members via the regional list system, he has been appointed \u201cgroup leader\u201d, beating the head of the party in Wales, Nathan Gill. Gill remains Welsh leader of Ukip because that role is directly appointed by Nigel Farage, the party\u2019s UK chief. This in no way sounds awkward. Hamilton told ITV Morning Britain he had strong ties with the country. \u201cCut me open, I\u2019d be like a stick of Blackpool Rock,\u201d he said, momentarily forgetting that Blackpool is not in Wales.           Does Neil Hamilton think Blackpool is in Wales?    Here\u2019s a quick reminder of some of Hamilton\u2019s career highlights, in case you were lucky enough to have missed them first time round. He was a Tory whip in the 1980s Hamilton became MP for Tatton in 1983, after failing to secure Bradford North in 1979. He served as a government whip under Margaret Thatcher, before becoming corporate affairs minister under John Major. Hamilton\u2019s views and policies \u2013 anti-Europe, pro-privatisation, anti-trade unions, and pro-smoking \u2013 haven\u2019t changed too much since. He wanted to shut down the coal mines Hamilton\u2019s roots may have been in coal mining \u2013 both his grandfathers were south Wales miners \u2013 but he was part of the Thatcher government that went to war with the industry and its unions. \u201cBritain couldn\u2019t continue being an industrial museum for ever,\u201d he explained more recently.   He opposed the removal of lead from petrol Hamilton wasn\u2019t too impressed at the medical and environmental evidence on unleaded petrol, telling parliament as recently as 1999 there was \u201cno evidence that lead in petrol poses any health risk\u201d.   A liar and a cheat     Guardian front page on Neil Hamilton in October 1996. Photograph: Guardian for the Guardian    Hamilton\u2019s political downfall came in 1996, after the Guardian reported he had taken money in brown envelopes from Mohamed Al Fayed in the \u201ccash-for-questions\u201d scandal. His libel suit against the paper collapsed, leading to this infamous headline and his resignation from government. He went on to lose his Tatton seat to journalist Martin Bell in 1997\u2019s general election. Nowadays, Tatton\u2019s MP is George Osborne, the chancellor. He was the subject of a Louis Theroux documentary             In 2001, Hamilton was considered weird enough to justify a Louis Theroux documentary, appearing alongside his wife, Christine. The couple used the programme to relaunch themselves as media stars and it\u2019s still compelling viewing, particularly Christine Hamilton\u2019s flirt scene, and Neil\u2019s House of Cards (original version) quoting response. The Hamiltons\u2019 friends in the Tory press weren\u2019t too impressed, but the couple seemed to know what they were doing. While Neil\u2019s political career was in the wilderness, he had a new plan. He becomes an all-purpose Z-list celebrity     Neil Hamilton poses with a model during the opening of the Erotica 2004 festival at Manchester\u2019s G-mex centre. Photograph: Phil Noble/PA    It\u2019s difficult to imagine now, but the Hamiltons became archtypes for a new kind of celebrity: famous for being famous, the initial context of their fame (public scandal and humiliation) seemed forgotten in an endless round of shameless PR appearances.  He danced for Johnny Vegas\u2019s fish            But suckling from the teat of media fame is a game of ever-descreasing circles, and tends to end one way: in a perspex cage being showered with fish while Johnny Vegas shouts: \u201cYou sicken me!\u201d He joins Ukip After first appearing on a Ukip stage in 2011, eyebrows were raised when Hamilton was given important roles within the party, rising to the role of campaigns director. He was demoted from the role in 2014. He becomes a Welsh assembly member     The Hamiltons in London, 2014.
