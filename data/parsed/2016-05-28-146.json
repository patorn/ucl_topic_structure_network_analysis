  "body": "Few things are more infuriating to a beauty nerd than the discontinuation of a beloved product. Such is the case with Dior\u2019s Glow Maximiser (\u00a329), a golden, light-reflecting primer balm that gives all skin tones a smooth, plumped surface with blurred lines and noticeable glow: only three years after launch, it\u2019s being put out to pasture this summer. Clearly it didn\u2019t sell in satisfactory numbers, and inevitably some people didn\u2019t like it, but when I announced the news on Instagram, many readers pleaded for advice as to the next best thing. So I swore to try every illuminating primer until I found a worthy replacement. So here\u2019s what I found. I liked Soap & Glory\u2019s Hocus Focus (\u00a311) a lot. Like Glow Maximiser, it can be worn under foundation to increase its longevity, but on casual days it is also lovely on its own. It has a strong if not unpleasant scent, and gives subtler glow, but if you found the Dior too spangly, this may be just the ticket \u2013 for brightening minus any sparkle, choose Bourjois Happy Light (\u00a310.99) or Chanel\u2019s Le Blanc (\u00a333). If, on the other hand, you want more, not less, face bling then Illamasqua\u2019s Radiance Veil (\u00a332) is ideal, although, for me, it all looked a bit Barbarella worn alone and needed the dimming qualities of a foundation over the top. Closer to the Dior were my three favourites. P\u00fcr Correcting Primer in Peach (\u00a318) had a near-perfect smoothing texture, glow without sparkle, and did a great job on unifying skin tone (though it contains shea butter, so oilies should avoid). Tom Ford Illuminating Primer (\u00a354) was a sheer joy: silky, glowy and just dewy enough. But Becca Backlight Priming Filter (\u00a332) was best of all. It significantly brightened my complexion on the dullest days, grabbed hold of foundation for dear life and gave the most flattering, blurry glow for both work photo shoots and domestic bumbling about. I\u2019m still hoping Dior thinks twice and wonders if it, not customers, failed to get behind Glow Maximiser, and that perhaps the product still has legs. If not now, then maybe this autumn, when another high-profile brand launches a very similar product (I can\u2019t yet reveal details, lest I\u2019m kneecapped). I predict a huge hit, which may just prompt Dior to realise what it let go, and to free Glow Maximiser from its premature retirement. But in case I\u2019m wrong, you have no more than a month to stock up.",
