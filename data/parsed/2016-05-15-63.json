  "body": "As the man who oversees the most popular show on television, The Great British Bake Off, BBC head of documentaries Patrick Holland can breathe a sigh of relief that the white paper did not allow the government to meddle with scheduling. But the corporation now has to focus on the ubiquitous watchword \u201cdistinctive\u201d when it chooses what shows to make, and that brings its own challenges as Holland says. \u201cThe debate that goes on about distinctiveness versus popularity is a completely false dichotomy; it\u2019s absurd. A documentary like Behind Closed Doors offered unprecedented access to domestic violence victims yet was watched by over three million people, The Real Marigold Hotel was watched by close to five million. These programmes were, in very different ways, distinctive and engaged very large audiences.\u201d He adds: \u201cCompetition is essential to the quality of programming for the audience. The BBC and Channel 4 are at the heart of that competitive ecology; look at the Baftas. I think all but four of the programme gongs went to those two organisations [Bake Off took home one]. The private sector needs the public broadcasters to drive quality.\u201d However there has been speculation that Bake Off could end up on one of the BBC\u2019s rivals after reports that talks to renew the show\u2019s contract after the next series had stalled over money. Holland is optimistic about it remaining on the BBC, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no stalling \u2026 negotiations are ongoing, we\u2019re still in really active talks. From our point of view it\u2019s very much this is always the case \u2013 we start negotiating contracts for the next series when we\u2019re filming the one before.\u201d When asked if the programme had become too expensive for his division and could move into entertainment to get a higher tariff, Holland says \u201cBake Off can easily remain within factual. We\u2019ll do the deal based on what\u2019s appropriate for the programme.\u201d The good news is there are no major changes to the forthcoming seventh series, which is already in production. Like a Mary Berry Victoria sponge, Holland is on the rise \u2013 coming from Grand Designs\u2019 maker Boundless a year ago to take over the old job of Charlotte Moore, controller of channels and iPlayer and ex-BBC1 controller. Since he arrived nobody could accuse his department of shying away from tough subjects \u2013 from Camila\u2019s Kids Company: The Inside Story to How to Die: Simon\u2019s Choice and Abused: The Untold Story. A year into his job, documentary-makers are keen to hear what his plans are. While the \u201cwinds of change\u201d are blowing outside the corporation, Holland says in his department they have \u201chunkered down\u201d and some \u201cextraordinary\u201d programmes are on the way. Coming up are The Cancer Club (which charts from the moment of patients\u2019 diagnoses through to their treatment), a look at couples having mediation in a programme provisionally called Divorce Clinic and a series about London\u2019s ambulance service. There\u2019s also The Last Mine \u2013 which had access to the closure of Britain\u2019s last deep-pit mine, Kellingley Colliery \u2013 plus a new perspective on the refugee crisis for BBC2, Exodus: Breaking Into Europe. Economic and war migrants\u2019 hazardous journeys are followed by producers Keo Films but also through their own eyes via 70 camera phones given to the refugees, who went through \u201csome places that you literally cannot travel through\u201d, such as areas of West Africa, says Holland. He describes the material as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. Not all make it through and in episode one viewers will see a father struggle with the terrifying decision of putting his family on a boat, which could have the kind of tragic ending that has featured in so many news bulletins. Out later this year too is Louis Theroux\u2019s follow-up to the programme on Jimmy Savile he made in 2000, in which he asks how the late presenter got away with years of abuse and why his victims were not heard. When asked if the BBC will be examined in it, Holland says: \u201cThe film will definitely address the sense of corporate and personal responsibility \u2013 it has to. How did he get away with it and there\u2019s responsibility at the heart of that. It\u2019s a Louis Theroux film, it\u2019s not a current affairs investigation. \u201cHe visits victims, people who worked with Savile, and he asks those questions and tries to explore the bigger corporate question but also the question for him personally.\u201d Sources say that past and present BBC staff are being asked to take part, although it is understood that the former BBC director general Mark Thompson has not been contacted. Holland will only say \u201cwait and see\u201d on who is appearing. Moore, with whom Holland has worked in the past, said in March that she wanted to \u201cbring back the director\u2019s voice to BBC2\u201d. \u201cThe importance of the director, who has a point of view, is at the heart of the mission really,\u201d explains Holland, pointing to commissions from distinctive directors such as Nick Broomfield, who is making a film about Whitney Houston. He says BBC3 is settling into its new online role. A new series, War on Drugs, will explore the social impact of drugs, plus there are \u201cimmersive\u201d documentaries with Reggie Yates and Stacey Dooley (Yates reports on prisons and a Mexican police force while Dooley spends time with groups such as anti-abortionists for a series about brainwashing). Having Moore now across BBC1 and BBC2 helps give \u201cgreater clarity\u201d and means \u201cthey aren\u2019t in competition\u201d, helping Holland to establish where documentaries should air depending on their scale and tone. Therefore Lawful Killing, a docu-drama about the shooting of Mark Duggan, which \u201cwas one of the most significant things in race relations in Britain for years [and which was] obviously a massive tragedy to Mark\u2019s family and has had a huge impact on the Metropolitan Police, is a BBC1 film\u201d. \u201cOur core brief is to be making the big stories that respond to the most important issues in Britain and the world through storytelling,\u201c Holland adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in TV over the past 15 to 20 years is that those skills of storytelling have meant different ways of telling stories at the edge of documentaries, so formats, drama-doc have all proliferated out from that \u2026 all the way through to Bake Off which is a format but began life in documentaries because it was about Britain\u2019s relationship with baking. \u201cDocumentaries we see as a mindset, a way of people putting stories, things they care about, at the heart of programmes.\u201d Despite the serious nature of much of his job, cricket fan Holland retains his sense of humour and admits, like many, to enjoying Gogglebox on a Friday night at home in Brighton. The son of a shoe salesman, who also had a market stall that the future BBC executive helped out on (\u201cI love people who are good at selling\u201d, says the man who once oversaw The Apprentice), Holland was \u201cobsessed with David Attenborough as a child\u201d. He got into television on his own merits, writing to companies whose shows he liked until he got a job. A keen advocate of social and racial diversity, he now worries that \u201cthere are huge barriers to entry. Rightfully we\u2019re doing something now and thinking \u2018how do you make it more than token?\u2019. \u201cThe thing that really annoys me,\u201d he concludes, is that when he ran talent schemes 10 years ago, \u201cthere were more black and Asian entrants then than black and Asian assistant producers I see now. It seems like there is less diversity in TV than there was. I say all that and of course now I\u2019m a white middle-class male, I\u2019m everything I despise!\u201d Curriculum vitae Age 47 Education Newport Free Grammar School, Essex; Emmanuel College, Cambridge (BA philosophy); University of Sussex (MA philosophy) Career 1995 researcher, The Big Story, ITV 1997 assistant producer, BBC Modern Times 2000 producer/director RDF Television 2005 executive producer, Ricochet 2012 managing director, Boundless 2015 head of commissioning, BBC Documentaries",
