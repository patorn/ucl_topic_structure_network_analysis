Israel\u2019s defence minister is out, departing not with the polite exchange of letters that would be Westminster custom but a fusillade aimed directly at his former boss. He said he could no longer trust Binyamin Netanyahu \u2013 and not only because Netanyahu had just offered his job to someone else.   Related: Israel's defence minister quits over rift with Binyamin Netanyahu    They disagreed on \u201cmoral and professional issues\u201d, Moshe Ya\u2019alon said, hinting that their battles were over \u201cmanifestations of extremism, violence and racism in Israeli society\u201d \u2013 with Bibi on the wrong side. In Ya\u2019alon\u2019s place is set to come a man routinely described as a thug, even if he did once serve as foreign minister. He\u2019s Avigdor Lieberman, the West Bank settler who\u2019s never quite shaken off his past life as a nightclub bouncer from Moldova. If it weren\u2019t for the accent, you\u2019d cast him alongside Tony and the New Jersey boys in a heartbeat. Normally a reshuffle in a distant land could be filed under \u201cinternal matters\u201d and safely ignored. But this latest move could well affect what was once fondly called the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians (these days there\u2019s no peace and barely any process). It also says something important about the struggle for Israel\u2019s soul. Make no mistake, Ya\u2019alon is no peacenik. He is a hawk, fully signed up to Likud intransigence and a favourite of the settlers. But he is also a former soldier who holds fast to a military ethos that believes might has to be constrained by the rule of law. Twice in recent weeks, this insistence on ethics put Ya\u2019alon at odds with the prime minister. The first clash came when an Israeli army medic shot dead a Palestinian \u2013 who had attacked a group of soldiers with a knife \u2013 as he lay injured on the ground, posing no threat. Ya\u2019alon led the military brass in denouncing the medic for his lethal indiscipline, for acting out of revenge. Bibi did too \u2013 at first. But then he saw that Israeli public opinion was rallying behind the soldier, so he switched sides, even telephoning the killer\u2019s father to demonstrate his sympathy. Ya\u2019alon was appalled.    Ya\u2019alon is no peacenik. But he holds to a military ethos that believes might has to be constrained by the rule of law    Then, a fortnight ago, the deputy chief of staff of the Israeli military, Yair Golan, spoke at a Holocaust Remembrance Day event and lamented what he felt were alarming resonances between the \u201cintolerance\u201d and \u201cfear-mongering\u201d visible in contemporary Israel, and the Germany of the 1930s. Golan was widely condemned, including by Netanyahu. Doubtless Ya\u2019alon disagreed with Golan\u2019s sentiments vehemently. But he defended the general\u2019s right to speak out, believing that this too is an essential part of the duty of a soldier in a democracy: to voice the misgivings of his conscience. With exquisite timing, this issue will be fought out in court on Sunday, when Breaking the Silence \u2013 a group that gathers the testimonies of Israeli soldiers, allowing them anonymity to describe the reality of the post-1967 occupation \u2013 will face a government demand that it reveal the soldiers\u2019 identities. The group says that this is a clear attempt to shut it down, for without the protection of anonymity few, if any, soldiers will be prepared to talk. So this is a critical battle in Israel. It\u2019s not between left and right, but rather a division within the right over the rule of law. Tellingly, in his resignation speech \u2013 in which he vowed to return to politics and one day compete for the top job \u2013 Ya\u2019alon also defended Israel\u2019s supreme court, a frequent punchbag for the ultra-nationalists. That his job has been offered to Lieberman \u2013 who during the last Gaza war called for Jewish Israelis to boycott Arab shops, and who once suggested Israel punish Egypt by bombing the Aswan dam \u2013 tells you on which side of this crucial divide Netanyahu now stands.     \u2018The plan was for a \u2018national unity\u2019 government, one committed to heeding this week\u2019s call by Egypt for a fresh peace effort backed by all Israel\u2019s parties \u2026 the matchmatker for this union was none other than Tony Blair.\u2019 Photograph: Hassan Ammar/AP    For those outside Israel, what matters most will, naturally, be the impact on Israel\u2019s conflict with the Palestinians. At first glance, and perhaps at second and third glance too, it\u2019s bad news. Consider that just a couple of days ago, it seemed the new addition to Netanyahu\u2019s coalition would be Labour\u2019s Isaac Herzog. The plan was for a \u201cnational unity\u201d government, one committed to heeding this week\u2019s call by Egypt for a fresh peace effort backed by all Israel\u2019s parties. It seemed on course, the matchmaker for this union being none other than Tony Blair \u2013 who, since his official Middle East envoy role expired, has continued in a freelance capacity, constantly meeting the region\u2019s leaders. He shuttled between Netanyahu, Herzog and Egypt\u2019s President Sisi, nudging the three parties toward each other. It all fell apart, not least because Herzog was unable to deliver his party\u2019s Knesset members and give Netanyahu the boost to his wafer-thin majority he sought. So instead of turning left, Israel\u2019s coalition has turned even further right.  For the optimist, the consolation comes in noting that, if Netanyahu were minded to make a move, he would now face no opposition on the right. The most seasoned Palestinian negotiators concluded long ago that their best shot at a deal is with a united Israeli right: the left might mean well, but would always be overcome by domestic resistance. Hopeful types also note that Lieberman may be brutal and a xenophobe, but he is also a pragmatist: unlike the more ideological rightist Naftali Bennett, he supports a two-state solution. This will all seem strictly hypothetical to those who can\u2019t forget that nothing has moved for years. And yet there are a few hints of activity. The French are launching their own initiative. And even though Bibi is said to be counting down the days till Barack Obama \u2013 whom he never trusted \u2013 leaves office, it\u2019s striking that US secretary of state, John Kerry, privately insists, \u201cI\u2019m not finished\u201d on Israel-Palestine.   Related: Israeli PM asks Avigdor Lieberman to be defence minister in shock move    The focus is on the curious three-month window between the US election on 8 November and the last day of Obama\u2019s term, on 20 January 2017, an interval when a president is at his freest, facing no electoral sanction. It was in that period that Ronald Reagan lent official US recognition to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, making a move that would have been too costly for his successor, Bush the elder. The talk in the Obama administration now is: what parting gift should Obama leave for (they hope) Hillary? It could be another big speech; it could be a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements. Or it could be a serious, lasting security council resolution \u2013 backed by all the world\u2019s powers \u2013 enshrining the broad parameters of the two-state solution. It would update the original 1947 UN resolution that called for the creation of a Jewish state alongside a state of Palestine, except it would set out that these two states should exist on the 1967 lines, give or take land swaps on both sides, with Jerusalem shared as their capital. I\u2019m told American officials are already quietly at work, talking to European allies and drafting the language of such a resolution, aiming to word it so that US Jews, for example, would find it irresistible. Netanyahu would do his best to rally opposition to it \u2013 but he did that on the Iran deal and failed. If it passed, it would set the terms for any future peace effort and would be hard to dodge. For it would represent nothing less than the will of the international community. It may not happen. In this conflict, the worst-case scenario is usually the likeliest. But as events this week showed, Binyamin Netanyahu is not always the master of events. And not all his enemies are abroad.",
