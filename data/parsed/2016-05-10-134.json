Sure, it would be drastic, but think of the catastrophes you would halt. The second world war. The Holocaust. Ken Livingstone locking himself in a toilet the other week. Me getting bombarded with tedious \u201cActually, if you\u2019d read the Haavara Agreement \u2026 \u201d tweets whenever I made a joke about Ken Livingstone locking himself in a toilet. All these things are awful, yet so easily expunged. Given the chance, you would kill Hitler. But I wouldn\u2019t. Although the world is full of complex, intractable and seemingly unrelated ills, I have figured out the root cause of all of them. If I had a time machine, I would save the world by going back and killing The Apprentice. In theory, The Apprentice is a television programme. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s a public repository for hair-gelled bell-ends who mangle half-Windsors and compare themselves to sharks. They turn up, they act like two-dimensional prannies, and then they disappear again. But recently, something terrible has happened. The Apprentice has become a training cell for politically toxic ideas. Let\u2019s start with the head of the snake. The Apprentice was created by NBC and Mark Burnett Productions in 2004 as a vehicle for Donald Trump. At that stage in his life, Trump was a circus clown on the slide, whose businesses had gone bankrupt four times. He was a product of a bygone age; an age of hairspray and Filofaxes and breezeblock-sized mobile phones. The man was a relic, lost at sea in a world he could no longer hope to understand. Just look at all his failed ventures from that decade. Trump Steaks. Trump Vodka. Trump Magazine. Trump: The Game. GoTrump.com. Each and every one of them the dismal, drain-circling spasm of a man desperately trying to stay relevant. But The Apprentice papered over these cracks. It allowed him to appear on TV and wear a suit and jab his finger a lot. The Apprentice turned Donald Trump into a towering figurehead of authority. Even though he was appearing on a reality show \u2013 the sort of idiotic, ground-level piecemeal gig that no billionaire in their right mind would ever touch with a bargepole \u2013 people started investing in the Trump myth. And now he is the presumptive Republican candidate in a real-life general election. Without The Apprentice, failed boardgame salesman. With The Apprentice, the almost-leader of the free world. I know which role I would prefer him to have. His candidates, too, have followed suit. The man rushing to defend the Trump supporter who sucker-punched a black protester at a March rally? That\u2019s Andy Dean, a candidate from the show\u2019s second series. The woman who most vocally attacked Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly during her spat with Trump last year? Tana Goertz, series three runner-up and Trump\u2019s Iowa campaign co-chair. To a much lesser extent, given that we\u2019re not actively thinking about giving any of these bozos the nuclear codes, this plague has spread to the UK. Over here, The Apprentice has given us treats such as Conservative baroness Karren Brady voting in favour of tax credit cuts, and Nick Hewer and Margaret Mountford presenting a nasty little Daily Express front page of a programme called Too Many Immigrants? And then there\u2019s our great white wail, Katie Hopkins. If it weren\u2019t for the show, Katie would still be a Met Office brand consultant, albeit one who nobody would go near because they didn\u2019t want her screeching, \u201cHello! Isn\u2019t it wonderful about all the dead babies?\u201d at them in the lift. But The Apprentice gave her a platform, and now she is the only person on Earth \u2013 including his own peers and relatives \u2013 who thinks Zac Goldsmith did a halfway decent job of running for London mayor. Last we heard, she was planning to protest against Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory by jamming a halal sausage up her bum and waddling up Regent Street an act as nauseating as it is offensive. Children might see her, for crying out loud. \u201cWhy is she doing that, Mummy?\u201d they\u2019ll ask. \u201cBecause a TV show made her sell fudge at a zoo,\u201d they will be told, and they will spend the rest of their lives shivering with confusion whenever they have to walk past a sweet shop. Even Alan Sugar \u2013 the hedgehog-faced Labour peer turned Trump surrogate \u2013 has fallen foul of this epidemic, resigning from the Labour party last year on the basis that it was too much like the Labour party. Sugar also later complained that London\u2019s mayor-to-be had \u201csingle-handedly ruined Labour\u201d. Not that this is a surprise. By its nature, The Apprentice exists to bring out the very worst in people. It\u2019s a series about avarice, about stiffing people over in a suffocating kill-or-be-killed corporate environment. It\u2019s a get-rich-quick-and-damn-the-consequences show. It might not have caused the 2008 banking crisis, but it probably didn\u2019t help. If you want to succeed on The Apprentice \u2013 if you want to be heard over the din of all the other braying tossers you have been saddled with \u2013 you have to learn to distil the worst aspects of your personality into a succession of horrible little soundbites. It\u2019s why Hopkins managed to respond to news about pork DNA being found in Malaysian chocolate by tweeting: \u201cHow\u2019s your chocolate today my little jihadis?\u201d, and why Trump was able to distil the complex issue of Mexican immigration down to: \u201cThey\u2019re rapists.\u201d Dreadful things said as simply as possible, that\u2019s The Apprentice way. Get good at that, and there\u2019ll be no stopping you. Incidentally, Piers Morgan has been an Apprentice finalist on two different continents now. History will not judge The Apprentice well. It is destined to be seen as a series that picked the worst of people, buffed their awfulness into a high-gloss finish, and then set them loose into the world. It simply cannot be allowed to continue. That is, unless one of the tasks this year involves making a time machine. If that happens, I\u2019m in.",
