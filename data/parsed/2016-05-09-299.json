  "body": "Good afternoon, and welcome to the first day of the election campaign \u2013 just 54 to go. We\u2019re glad to have you with us for the inaugural Campaign catchup, your day-by-day cheatsheet to the election, in your inbox in time for your afternoon commute ... or cup of tea, or swift half \u2013 whatever you\u2019re doing. Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten both began their campaigns in Queensland, but took different paths. The prime minister got a head start on his five-a-day while the Labor leader went back to school. \u201cAh, the campaign trail,\u201d remarked Lenore Taylor, Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, this morning \u2013 \u201cwhere politicians look at things and have brief conversations with regular people.\u201d     My 1st job was loading watermelons - visited markets w Moreton candidate Nic Monsour discussing #smallbiz tax cuts pic.twitter.com/QPVif9O0zB\u2014 Malcolm Turnbull (@TurnbullMalcolm) May 9, 2016    Turnbull\u2019s three-electorate sweep of Brisbane began at a produce market in Rocklea, where he \u201ccouldn\u2019t refuse ... the luscious fruit\u201d, AAP reported (\u201cMmm, that\u2019s a beautiful melon,\u201d he said.) He also \u201csampled some blueberries\u201d but eschewed the brown onion apparently beloved of his predecessor Tony Abbott, which went unremarked upon by no one.    Prime Minister @TurnbullMalcolm avoids his own onion-munching moment at a Brisbane market #ausvotes #auspol https://t.co/CPzomjD1Ra\u2014 ABC News (@abcnews) May 9, 2016    Turnbull pressed on to Petrie \u2013 the Coalition\u2019s most marginal seat, held by Luke Howarth on just 0.5% \u2013 for the first announcement of his campaign, about \u201csupporting jobs and growth, right across the country\u201d. Special mention was made of tackling youth unemployment through the Coalition\u2019s paid internships scheme and giving businesses relief from tax, both hallmarks of Scott Morrison\u2019s budget announcement last week.           Turnbull makes early campaign pitch on youth employment plan    As Guardian Australia\u2019s deputy political editor Katharine Murphy wrote, the fact the government began its bid for re-election not with a big interview or flashy policy launch, but by selling the budget was a consequence of calling an election so soon after it was handed down. Though, Murph noted, every day now feels like campaign day. Meanwhile, Shorten pitched further north, his face writ enormous on his campaign bus in Cairns \u2013 \u201creally kind of disconcerting\u201d.    Big Bill. Little Bill. #politiclive @murpharoo pic.twitter.com/D84xop9O3F\u2014 Gabrielle Chan (@gabriellechan) May 9, 2016    After squatting alongside pupils at Cairns West state school for a photo, Shorten announced one of Labor\u2019s \u201c100 positive policies\u201d \u2013 to make Australia \u201cthe number-one educational centre in our region\u201d. This, he said, stood in contrast with Turnbull\u2019s education election pitch: \u201cThere is no plan for schools except cuts\u201d.   Related: Turnbull reminisces about banana packing as 'real world' campaign foray bears fruit    Accompanied by Labor\u2019s Western Australia Senate candidate Pat Dodson, Shorten said Labor\u2019s Gonski school funding package would include 400 scholarships for Indigenous Australians to train as teachers \u2013 a policy that would cost $4.8m over four years. Dutton reveals \u2018unsuccessful people smuggling venture\u2019 Embattled immigration minister Peter Dutton signalled today that he might appeal against a federal court ruling that he breached his duty of care to an asylum seeker raped on Nauru, who subsequently sought an abortion. He asked journalists to \u201chave a look at the judgment of the court as opposed to what\u2019s being read on social media\u201d.    very well lit presser in Brisbane with Peter Dutton.

It was returned to Sri Lanka in accordance with the government\u2019s \u201csovereign borders\u201d operation. Questioned over the delay in publicising this, Dutton said: \u201cWe make an announcement in relation to these matters at an appropriate time when it\u2019s operationally sensible to do so.\u201d And pressed as to whether it counted as a turnback or an arrival, Dutton said it would be counted as \u201cnot a successful people smuggling venture\u201d.  Discouraging negative gearing \u2018may be a good thing\u2019 \u2013 RBA Reserve Bank officials are about to become unwitting players in the election, Guardian Australia\u2019s Gareth Hutchens reports.  \u201cAny change which discourages negative gearing may be a good thing from a [financial stability] perspective,\u201d the RBA document says \u2013 contradicting Turnbull government\u2019s warnings that any changes to negative gearing would destroy confidence in the economy and send house prices plummeting. \u201cThe concessional rate of taxation of capital gains might encourage leverage speculation, particularly in combination with negative gearing provisions.\u201d Labor wants to make housing more affordable by limiting negative gearing to new properties and cutting the capital gains tax discount from 50% to 25%. The Grattan Institute has also proposed changes \u2013 but Turnbull and Morrison have vigorously attacked such proposals.
