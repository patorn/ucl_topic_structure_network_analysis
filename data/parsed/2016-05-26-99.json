But it was little deterrent to a crow, who swooped into the crime scene and breezed past more than 20 police officers to make off with the knife in question.  \u201cIt was really strange,\u201d said Vancouver Courier reporter Mike Howell. \u201cIn my 20-plus years reporting from crime scenes, I\u2019ve never seen anything like that crow trying to take a knife.\u201d  One of the officers was forced to follow the crow as it scampered away with the knife firmly in its beak. \u201cA cop chased it for about 15ft to 20ft, and then the crow dropped it and took off,\u201d Howell told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on Wednesday.  Vancouver police confirmed that a crow had \u2013 albeit temporarily \u2013 interfered with the crime scene investigation. \u201cThe crow was persistent, but the knife was eventually gathered as evidence,\u201d said spokesman Brian Montague.  Sporting a red band on its leg, the crow was also spotted perched on the roof of the crime scene\u2019s charred car and pecking at gear belonging to a local camera operator. It also tried to steal a pair of sunglasses from the area.  Some speculated the ruckus-raising bird in question was actually Canuck the crow, described by the CBC as the city\u2019s most notorious bird. Rehabilitated by humans after falling from its nest, the bird \u2013 identifiable by a red tag on its leg \u2013 has become a fixture in East Vancouver, celebrated for his penchant for making off with cigarettes, lighters, keys and anything else he can get.  A Facebook page dedicated to Canuck documents his many escapades, which range from flapping around on public transit alongside commuters to skateboarding.  Police said on Tuesday that a 28-year-old man had been shot after he confronted police with a knife. He was taken to hospital and treated for gunshot and knife wounds that were not life-threatening. The shooting is being investigated by the province\u2019s independent investigations office.",
