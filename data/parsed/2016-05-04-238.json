  "body": "BT is the most likely UK company to bid for Channel 4, according to a new report that estimates a sale protecting the broadcaster\u2019s model might only raise about \u00a3500m for the government. The 74-page report argues that the impact of selling off Channel 4 would be \u201coverwhelmingly negative\u201d for the UK economy, the broadcasting industry and creative industries. The report, commissioned by Channel 4\u2019s board, rejects the widely reported \u00a31bn potential sale price attached to the broadcaster, arguing it is unachievable unless a buyer was given huge scope to commercialise the not-for-profit business. Last week, the culture secretary, John Whittingdale said Channel 4 could be \u201cbetter off\u201d and have a \u201cstronger future\u201d in private hands.    Related: The only thing Channel 4 needs to be saved from is privatisation    The report, by academics at London Business School and Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation, rejects this view, arguing Channel 4 has a \u201ccomfortably sustainable\u201d business model as a state-owned, commercially funded broadcaster. According to the report, its most likely buyer is a US buyer or consortium, such as Discovery or Channel 5 owner Viacom, with the prime UK candidate BT.  \u201cThe most likely [UK communications company] candidate is, in our view, BT,\u201d the report says. \u201cGiven its cash flow and balance sheet, BT could certainly afford to buy Channel 4, even after the EE acquisition. It is also already expanding in TV, although this development is still at a relatively early stage.\u201d The report says a UK comms company might be considered a \u201cmore attractive\u201d buyer politically than a US company, because it would keep Channel 4 in UK hands and is most likely to keep its publisher-broadcaster model intact, but the government would have to run an open, competitive bidding process. Channel 4 could be valued \u201coptimistically\u201d at \u00a3530m to \u00a3620m, including \u00a3175m in cash from the broadcaster\u2019s balance sheet, but the report believes a \u201crealistic maximum price\u201d would be \u00a3400m to \u00a3500m \u2013 unless the government allows a buyer to radically overhaul Channel 4\u2019s model. \u201cAny price above this approximate range can only come from [the buyer\u2019s] ability to get more \u2018bang for the buck\u2019 \u2013 revenue per pound \u2013 from Channel 4\u2019s content budget,\u201d says the report. \u201cThis is the big issue for privatisation because of the tension between delivering the remit and maximising shareholder value and, therefore, the privatisation proceeds.\u201d A new buyer would need to shift a significant amount of Channel 4\u2019s \u00a3600m-plus content budget to, mostly, buying US programming from the suitors\u2019 own production businesses. The report\u2019s writers claim to have seen one investment bank presentation that looked at a scenario of a 30% cut in total content spend, and a 10% cut in marketing spend. This would imply a 50% reduction in Channel 4\u2019s spend on UK content, which stood at \u00a3430m in 2014. \u201cAny change in Channel 4\u2019s ownership or business model would require primary legislation, taking about two years to go through parliament,\u201d says the report. \u201cGiven the associated effort, risks and inevitable controversy, and the heavy current political agenda (Europe, refugees, the NHS, etc), it seems unlikely \u2013 although not inconceivable \u2013 that the government would wish to proceed with Channel 4 privatisation in the hope of raising just \u00a3500m from the sale, just above Channel 4\u2019s book value (\u00a3443m).\u201d",
