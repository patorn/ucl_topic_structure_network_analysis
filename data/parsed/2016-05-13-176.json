  "body": "The appointment of Paul Zwillenberg as chief executive of the Daily Mail & General Trust  may not have been greeted with massive enthusiasm in the office of the Daily Mail\u2019s editor, Paul Dacre. Some 20 years ago, after Zwillenberg had delivered his views on all things digital to a group of Associated Newspaper executives, Dacre was widely reported afterwards as remarking: \u201cWhat language was this guy speaking, Double Dutch?\u201d But Zwillenberg\u2019s skills have always been appreciated by the man who out-ranks Dacre: Viscount Rothermere (aka Jonathan Harmsworth). The pair have been friends since they attended Duke University in the United States. Zwillenberg was appointed as managing director of DMGT\u2019s new media division, Associated Electronic Publishing (later called Associated New Media), in 1996 (prior to Rothermere inheriting his title).  At AEP\u2019s first Christmas party, under Martin Dunn\u2019s editorship, he gave several colleagues a series of joke presents.  Zwillenberg\u2019s was a doormat inscribed with the words: \u201cOh no, not you again!\u201d Dunn explained that it was for the most office footfall with the least amount of completed business. But Zwillenberg went on to greater things. After leaving DMGT, he became global head of technology, media, and telecommunications at OC&C Strategy Consultants. After eight years there, he joined the Boston Consulting Group in 2010, where he advised companies on the virtues of digital technology. Notably, one of those companies was DMGT. His appointment was a surprise. A Reuters report (carried by Mail Online) said: \u201cMany analysts had expected finance director Stephen Daintith to get the top job.\u201d  I thought Kevin Beatty, chief executive of dmg media, would be in the running. So the choice of Zwillenberg shows that DMGT is embracing the digital future with even more zeal than it has already. Note that quote from Rothermere:  \u201cPaul\u2019s strategic insight and close involvement across our portfolio over the last 20 years means that he is ideal for the role of chief executive at this exciting time for our diversified businesses.\u201d  Maybe, but Zwillenberg\u2019s elevation is surely something of a punt. A digital guru is not necessarily going to make a good chief executive of a multi-million pound business.  The somewhat guarded reaction of analysts was also revealing. For example, the Peel Hunt analyst, Alex DeGroote, said he thought it \u201cfascinating\u201d.  He went on to concede that Zwillenberg\u2019s \u201cdigital skillset seems well suited to the business changes under way in many of DMGT\u2019s key markets\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is a surprise, but I get the logic.\u201d",
