Canada\u2019s normally staid House of Commons erupted into chaos on Wednesday, after the visibly annoyed Trudeau marched into a group of MPs, grabbed Conservative Gordon Brown by the arm and led him out of the group.  Parliamentarians were waiting to vote on a controversial motion from the Liberals to limit debate on assisted suicide legislation. The vote was delayed while several New Democrat MPs gathered around Brown, seemingly impeding him from taking his place. Trudeau swore as he strode toward Brown, reportedly telling MPs to \u201cget the fuck out of the way\u201d. Footage from the House of Commons showed Trudeau elbowing New Democrat Ruth Ellen Brosseau as he pulled Brown away from the group.

MPs shouted and pounded their desks as Tom Mulcair, leader of the New Democratic party, lashed out at Trudeau. \u201cWhat kind of man elbows a woman? It\u2019s pathetic! You\u2019re pathetic!\u201d Mulcair shouted. Trudeau later apologised twice for the incident. On Thursday, Trudeau reiterated his apologies. \u201cNo amount of escalation or mood in this house justifies my behaviour last night. I made a mistake, I regret it, I\u2019m looking to make amends,\u201d he said. \u201cI accept full responsibility for my poor choices last night and I ask for Canadians\u2019 understanding and forgiveness.\u201d The incident will be reviewed by an all-party committee, after the speaker of the House of Commons, Liberal Geoff Regan, concluded that Brosseau\u2019s privileges as an MP had been breached.  Trudeau said his actions would be reviewed by the House of Commons committee on procedure and House affairs. On Thursday opposition MPs urged Trudeau to make amends by withdrawing a contentious motion that would give the government power to decide when debates should be extended or adjourned. Others wanted more, with Conservative Peter Kent suggesting Trudeau\u2019s actions were in contempt of parliament. Dan Davies, a former labor lawyer turned New Democrat, demanded consequences, arguing that no workplace in Canada would allow an employee to be physically moved along by their boss. \u201cWhile an apology is absolutely essential, that is not sufficient,\u201d Davies said. The fracas at parliament dominated headlines across Canada, with #elbowgate trending on Twitter. Many pointed to the last time a Canadian legislature got physical: a 2013 incident in which Rob Ford, the late, former mayor of Toronto, bowled over a 63-year-old female city councillor as he rushed to defend his brother, councillor Doug Ford, who was arguing with members of the public in the council chamber.  Wednesday\u2019s incident provoked howls of disapproval from opposition politicians. \u201cNo one should ever have to deal with this kind of behaviour in any workplace,\u201d the opposition leader, Rona Ambrose, said in a statement. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s the prime minister of Canada is embarrassing. He should be ashamed of his actions.\u201d Brown, the MP at the centre of the melee, said in a statement to media that he told Trudeau to \u201clet go of me \u2013 now. \u200eImmediately afterward, the prime minister went back down the aisle of the House to confront other Members of Opposition parties. I later told the prime minister he should NOT have gotten out of his seat.\u201d  New Democrat Niki Ashton contrasted Trudeau\u2019s actions with his image as a modern, feminist leader. \u201cNot only was this the furthest thing from a feminist act \u2026 He made us feel unsafe and deeply troubled by the conduct of the prime minister of this country.\u201d Conservative Jason Kenney tweeted that if Stephen Harper, the country\u2019s former prime minister, had ever physically bullied MPs as Trudeau did on Wednesday, there would be immediate and widespread demands for his resignation. Others defended Trudeau. \u201cThere is nothing intentional that happened here,\u201d said Liberal Judy Foote. \u201cAnd I think we have to bear in mind that sometimes emotions run very high, but at this point in time I think we need to accept the prime minister\u2019s apology and recognise that civil obedience is something that we all appreciate.\u201d Elizabeth May, the leader of Canada\u2019s Green party, described Trudeau\u2019s actions as unacceptable but called the elbowing an accident. \u201cHe had not seen her behind him. That is the truth. Now you can like it or not like it.\u201d The CBC described Wednesday as Trudeau\u2019s least sunny day, a reference to the prime minister\u2019s guiding philosophy of \u201csunny ways\u201d.  \u201cOne can now read any number of character traits into the act: impatience, impulsiveness, bravado, pugnacity. But whatever his reason, it was obviously unwise and what resulted was undignified,\u201d wrote one political reporter. \u201cA prime minister who understands the importance of image might understand tonight as unfortunate. And now it is one more thing his government will have to concern itself with.\u201d A columnist in the Globe and Mail, noted that the images \u201cconflicted so jarringly with the Justin Trudeau image of a cheerful, collaborative leader\u201d. Five of the newspaper\u2019s 10 most-read stories of the day centred on Wednesday\u2019s melee.  In an editorial, the newspaper added that when governments are accused of \u201criding roughshod\u201d over the opposition, the phrase is meant to be metaphorical. \u201cPhysically grabbing your opponents is the opposite of respect, and while it\u2019s clear that Mr Trudeau lost his temper, other people lose their tempers all the time in public life and don\u2019t resort to using anything more forceful than words.\u201d",
