  "body": "In the moments leading up to Fetty Wap\u2019s entrance, it feels as if it would be quite an achievement to kill the atmosphere at a heaving and heady Hammersmith Apollo this evening. Somehow, Wap manages it in about five minutes. Tonight marks the New Jersey rapper\u2019s first proper UK show, which makes it even more remarkable that he has this much excitement available to him to quell. But then again, the 24-year-old is among hip-hop\u2019s fastest-ever rising stars: despite having only been rapping for three years, in August he became the first artist to have his first four singles in the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s hip-hop chart all at once.  It was a run that started with Trap Queen, his ode to a crack-cooking colleague that was the song of last summer. A track that cleaved to the trap formula \u2013 both in subject matter (the \u201ctrap\u201d refers to the place where drugs are dealt, as well as the inescapable nature of that lifestyle) and sound (ominously stabbing synths, flickering hi-hats and tinny snares) \u2013 but one Wap had layered with two simple sing-song hooks.             With it, he took trap into poppier territory than Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Drake and even Katy Perry, all of whom have referenced its sound.   Related: Fetty Wap: \u2018I didn\u2019t even get to use no bed \u2013 I was lucky to have a carpet\u2019      Tonight, Wap opens with Wake Up, a new song that plonks a brash piano hook over the usual trap formula. It\u2019s a track so jaunty that it makes Trap Queen seem laden with sultry menace \u2013 in fact, it borders on novelty. But it at least allows Wap to build the momentum briefly; he then decides to showcase 20 minutes of identikit, vaguely melodious trap and dismantles it completely. While it\u2019s a cliche to say that an artist\u2019s songs all sound the same, it would be nigh on impossible to tell where one ended and another began without Wap\u2019s punctuating call of \u201c1738\u201d (a reference to his crew) and gunshot sound effects.  Still, if Wap could do justice to his hits (and he does have a few great pop songs in his arsenal), then perhaps he could have turned things around. But when they did arrive \u2013 My Way, 679, Again, Trap Queen, all in a row \u2013 buried hooks and overpowering bass meant they quickly fell flat.  Wap has referred to his music as \u201cignorant R&B\u201d. Fittingly, he has never clarified that categorisation, but you can\u2019t help thinking he was referring to the fact that his knowledge of the genre of music he makes is limited. In a recent interview, he claimed never to have heard of Rapper\u2019s Delight, and has said that growing up he mainly just listened to Gucci Mane (the Wap bit of his moniker is a tribute to the rapper). It also points to Wap\u2019s apparent willingness to wing it, and clumped-together hits and an abrupt ending prove this show has not been well thought out. It\u2019s impossible to predict whether Wap\u2019s star is destined to wane as quickly as it rose \u2013 but after tonight, it certainly doesn\u2019t seem out of the question. \u2022 At Reading and Leeds festivals, 26 and 27 August respectively. Then touring.",
