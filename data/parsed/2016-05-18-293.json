The broadcast came shortly before Trump was declared the winner in Oregon over rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich, who remained on the ballot despite having dropped out of the race earlier this month. With nearly 20% of the vote counted, Trump had 64.3% of the vote, to Ohio governor Kasich\u2019s 20.2% and Texas senator Cruz\u2019s 15.5%.   Kentucky and Oregon   Trump and Kelly finally sat down on national television after reaching a truce that brought an end to a feud dating back to the first Republican presidential debate last August.  Their animosity began with Trump\u2019s assertion following the debate that Kelly, one of its moderators, treated him unfairly, and his now infamous comment implying she had been on her period.  He continued to berate her coverage of his campaign through his Twitter account and even skipped a Republican debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses that Kelly moderated.           Ivanka Trump: my father is not a \u2018groper\u2019    But Tuesday\u2019s much hyped interview contained few challenges on Kelly\u2019s part toward Trump, who used the opportunity to try and portray a softer demeanor and begin to put behind him some of the more controversial moments of his primary campaign. Seeking to defend the brash and often ugly turns of his campaign, Trump suggested it was simply a means of emerging from the crowded Republican field as a winner.  \u201cIf I were soft, if I were presidential \u2026 in a way it\u2019s a bad word, because there\u2019s nothing wrong with being presidential, but if I had not fought back in the way I fought back, I don\u2019t think I would have been successful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI respond pretty strongly, but in just about all cases, I\u2019ve been responding to what they did to me.\u201d The interview followed an hourlong meeting between Trump and Kelly in April at his eponymous tower in New York, which thawed the friction that for months separated Kelly from her colleagues at Fox News \u2013 where coverage has largely tilted in his favor. Kelly did, however, confront Trump over his conduct toward her following the August debate in Cleveland, Ohio. The former reality TV star explained he had never participated in a debate before and in essence grew flustered. \u201cThat was the first question I\u2019ve ever been asked,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying to myself, \u2018Man what a question. And I\u2019m saying to myself, I\u2019ve got two hours of this?\u2019\u201d He also sought to downplay his embrace of the phrase \u201cbimbo\u201d to describe Kelly, suggesting at first that he didn\u2019t recall doing so. When Kelly pointed out Trump had on several occasions retweeted followers insulting her as such, he responded: \u201cOoo. OK. Did I say that? Excuse me.\u201d He added: \u201cOver your life, Megyn, you\u2019ve been called a lot worse. It\u2019s a modern form of fighting back.\u201d Kelly said that it was not about her but rather about the message sent to young girls, to which Trump only offered that he would no longer go after her \u201cbecause I think I like our relationship right now\u201d. Trump has slowly looked to rebuild his image while shifting gears toward a general election contest in which he is expected to face Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Although his litany of controversial statements remain part of the public record, Trump had already signaled a shift in tone while discussing his proposal to ban all Muslims from coming to the US \u2013 referring to it as merely a suggestion in an interview last week despite campaigning on the platform for months. Kelly did not press Trump in great detail on policy, choosing instead to allow him to reveal his personal side by reflecting on prior marriages and what he learned about himself from such experiences.  Trump gave the interview his stamp of approval, tweeting at its conclusion:    Well, that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how \"THE MOVEMENT\" does in Oregon tonight!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2016        Republicans    Democrats",
