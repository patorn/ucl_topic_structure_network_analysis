  "body": "Dates refer to the publication of the review - the later films had a 1987 release in the UK. 13 April 1986: Room with a View\u2018Equally sensitive to the emotional currents of the Edwardian era as to the nuances of Forsterian moral comedy... captivatingly beautiful, and elegiacally sad.\u2019 27 July 1986: Sid and Nancy\u2018This is a love story, but one that denies romance... Sid and Nancy are trash, too repellent to be conventional pop martyrs.\u2019     Chloe Webb and Gary Oldman in Sid and Nancy (1986). Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/New Line    14 August 1986: Pretty in Pink\u2018John Hughes and Howard Deutch embroider this passion fruit tale with every icon of the under-21 set they can muster. But crisp as the crust is, the inside of the pie remains obstinately like junk-food goo.\u2019 4 September 1986: Mona Lisa\u2018A parable about the strong preying upon the weak, and the ultimate reasons why you can trust no one but yourself.\u2019     Bob Hoskins and Cathy Tyson on the set of Mona Lisa (1986). Photograph: Herbie Knott/Rex    7 September 1986: Highlander\u2018A hare-brained sword-and-sorcery fantasy that bounces off the eyeballs like a laser beam and never gets near the brain or the heart.\u2019 5 October 1986: Top Gun\u2018A high-tech update of a traditional Hollywood recruiting movie... A defensible patriotism crosses the line into a disturbing chauvinism.\u2019     Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis with producers Don Simpson (second left) and Jerry Bruckheimer on the Top Gun set. Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex Features    6 November 1986: Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u2018Its hero is a real ratbag, who somehow gets to be endearing... a latterday rebel with a cause who is precisely what the system deserves, since it puts such a premium on success and enterprise.\u2019 7 December 1986: Labyrinth\u2018Though attractive, it is imperfect. The songs are unmemorable and there is more wizardry than magic, more sweetness than charm.\u2019     Jennifer Connelly with David Bowie as the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986). Photograph: Tristar/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock    11 December 1986: Crocodile Dundee\u2018There\u2019s nothing better than being agreeably surprised by something you suspect is going to be fairly awful.\u2019 15 February 1987: The Fly\u2018A film of poignancy and depth that may need to be preceded by warning flags but not by apologies.\u2019 15 March 1987: Stand By Me\u2018An economical, gentle, truthful tale... the thinking boy\u2019s Tom Sawyer without the melodrama and puppy-love.\u2019     Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Jerry O\u2019Connell and Corey Feldman in Stand By Me (US 1986). Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Columbia    9 April 1987: Blue Velvet\u2018Nothing as remotely unhealthy has come out of Hollywood for years but also nothing that so upends our usual expectations of the commercial cinema.\u2019     Isabella Rossellini and Kyle MacLachlan in Blue Velvet (US 1986). Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    23 April 1987: Platoon\u2018Platoon isn\u2019t imaginatively wrathful. It has no poetry in it. But it is real enough to hold the attention like a vice.\u2019   Related: Hadley Freeman: why I owe it all to 1980s movies",
