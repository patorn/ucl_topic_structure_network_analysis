  "body": "Surrounded by heavily embroidered and sequinned dresses and shalwar kameez in Saiqa, an upmarket boutique in Tooting, south London, Aisha critically eyed her reflection in a full-length mirror. The stunning three-layered dress she had tried on needed a little alteration \u2013 a pinch here and a shortening there \u2013 she and the designer Saiqa Majeed agreed. Although absorbed in choosing an outfit for a special occasion, Aisha was quick to celebrate Sadiq Khan\u2019s anticipated victory in the London mayoral election. \u201cThe United States has had Obama, and this is our moment. It\u2019s amazing that London is about to get its first Muslim mayor,\u201d she said. \u201cThis vote is a reflection of London\u2019s epic diversity. This is a city of tolerance, the best city in the world to be a Muslim. It\u2019s terrible that for the past eight years we\u2019ve had a mayor who doesn\u2019t reflect the great, diverse, wonderful melting pot of London.\u201d And, she added, the result was \u201ctwo fingers to Zac Goldsmith\u2019s racist campaign\u201d. Tooting is Khan\u2019s home turf. The son of a bus driver and a seamstress, he was born in St George\u2019s hospital, a local landmark. He grew up with his seven siblings in a nearby council flat and attended a local comprehensive school. For the past 11 years he has been the MP for the area, whose population is more than 20% Muslim, compared with 5% nationally.  His election as London mayor now makes him possibly the highest-profile and most powerful Muslim political figure in the western world. For the next four years, and perhaps longer, Khan will command the biggest and most dynamic city in western Europe, representing 8.5 million people and responsible for a \u00a317bn annual budget. Shuja Shafi, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said Khan was \u201ca figure of unity for all Londoners\u201d. He added: \u201cSadiq has demonstrated remarkable dignity in the face of hatred and suspicion about his religious background. Smear-by-association has become all too common for Muslims and Muslim organisations. It is a cancer blighting sections of our political and media class, and has infected the solemn business of government.\u201d     Al-Muzzamil mosque in Tooting. Photograph: Mary Turner/Getty Images    At Tooting\u2019s al-Muzzamil mosque, where those unable to squeeze inside for Friday prayers unrolled prayer mats on the pavement under a hot sun, the imam Zahir Hussain said the election of a Muslim mayor was \u201cfantastic in many ways, but he must represent everyone\u201d. The most urgent issues that Khan needed to address were housing and transport, he said \u2013 a view echoed by other locals. \u201cSadiq comes to pray here regularly,\u201d said Hussain, who runs double shifts of Friday prayers to accommodate the faithful. \u201cI have found him humble and easygoing and respectful.\u201d Outside the mosque, Shamsa Mohammed said Khan\u2019s election showed that London was a united city. \u201cDespite everything, by electing Sadiq people are saying we have confidence in a Muslim to do the job. We\u2019re all in it together, and together we can rise above all the problems,\u201d she said. Not everyone was a Khan enthusiast. Malik Mohammed, of Air Host Travel, said he had not voted on Thursday as he had been too busy. But he distrusted the promotion of Khan by people with \u201ca big agenda\u201d, suggesting that a liberal Muslim mayor could provide cover for those intent on attacking traditional Islam.  \u201cHe\u2019s too liberal. He even backed same-sex marriage. He doesn\u2019t uphold traditional values,\u201d he said.   Related: Global press reaction to Sadiq Khan a mix of curiosity and ignorance    In Saiqa\u2019s boutique, another customer, Fatema, who declined to give her full name, said she had voted for Goldsmith. \u201cI just don\u2019t agree with what Khan stands for. I\u2019m a bit of a conservative. Lots of Muslims will have voted for him just because he\u2019s a Muslim, not for what he believes in.\u201d Majeed, the dress designer and shop\u2019s owner, disagreed. \u201cSadiq is the perfect person to take London to the next level. He is integrated with real people and real communities. He can reflect London back to itself. And he\u2019s a doer. Lots of politicians just talk.\u201d Aisha, who also declined to give her full name as she did not want her political views known to her employers, went further. \u201cThis is a challenge to the accepted notion that you have to go to Eton to get anywhere,\u201d she said while trying to decide how much ankle her new dress should show. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a massive endorsement of Jeremy Corbyn. He\u2019s providing proper opposition to the Conservatives, and Labour have to hold their nerve. I love him!\u201d",
