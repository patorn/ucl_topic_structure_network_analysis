  "body": "In December, Ted Cruz called Donald Trump \u201cterrific\u201d. On Tuesday, just hours before polls close in Indiana, Cruz described the Republican frontrunner as \u201ca serial philanderer\u201d, an \u201camoral pathological liar\u201d, and a \u201cbraggadocious, arrogant buffoon\u201d. \u201cIf Indiana does not act, this country could well plunge into the abyss,\u201d he said. The senator\u2019s tirade against his rival came only a few hours after Trump suggested that Cruz\u2019s father was somehow involved in the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy, using a tabloid story as his source. \u201cNobody even brings it up, they don\u2019t even talk about it,\u201d Trump said.   Related: 'America is a better country without you': Ted Cruz's very bad day    A spokesperson for Cruz immediately called Trump \u201cdetached from reality\u201d, but the senator felt compelled to give a press conference full of the scathing personal attacks that he had previously said he would resist. \u201cI am going to do something I haven\u2019t done this entire campaign, I am going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump,\u201d he began. Cruz then poured sarcasm, disbelief and derision on the man who stands poised to secure the Republican nomination: \u201cYes, my dad killed JFK, he is secretly Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard. \u201cThis is just kooky,\u201d he continued, calling Trump \u201ca narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country has ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, \u2018Dude, what\u2019s your problem?\u2019\u201d The senator was infuriated by Trump\u2019s baseless claim about his father that he scorned the thrice-married businessman as a \u201cserial philanderer \u2013 and he boasts about it!\u201d The businessman \u201cdescribes his battles with venereal disease as his own personal Vietnam\u201d, Cruz said, alluding to a radio interview in which Trump likened his sex life to the war. \u201cMorality does not exist for him.\u201d Reality itself is at odds with Trump, Cruz continued: \u201cIf you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening \u2013 all contradictory \u2013 and he\u2019d pass the lie detector test. Whatever lie he\u2019s telling, in that minute he believes it.\u201d Though Cruz did not say he would not support Trump in the general election, should the former reality TV star win the Republican nomination, he drew very close to the line. Adding a layer of surreality to the already strange campaign, he compared Trump to Biff Tannen, the fictional villain of Back to the Future Part II, the 1989 film whose writer was partially inspired by Trump.  \u201cWe are looking potentially at the Biff Tannen presidency,\u201d Cruz said. He even turned to slam Fox News and the two powerful conservatives who run the cable network, saying: \u201cRupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes have turned Fox News into the Donald Trump Network 24/7.\u201d An attack against the rightwing news network would have been considered heresy among Republicans not long ago, but Cruz has grown increasingly critical of the company over perceived bias by some of its anchors, such as Sean Hannity. Cruz pleaded with the voters of Indiana, a state he needs to do well in to preserve a chance of a contested convention, to keep his hopes alive. \u201cThis is not who America is, and I would say to the Hoosier State: the entire country is depending on you.\u201d The Texas senator was so infuriated by Trump\u2019s claims over the JFK assassination that he then proceeded to call Trump \u201ca pathological liar\u201d and added: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the difference between truth and lies, he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth.\u201d Both Republican campaigns had their own accounts of the spat. A spokesperson for Cruz called the tabloid story, which based its allegations on a grainy picture of dubious credibility, \u201ca garbage story and clearly Donald wants to talk about garbage\u201d.  Trump\u2019s put out a statement on \u201cthe most recent outburst from Ted Cruz\u201d.  \u201cOver the last week, I have watched Lyin\u2019 Ted become more and more unhinged as he is unable to react under the pressure and stress of losing,\u201d the businessman said in the statement. \u201cIt is no surprise he has resorted to his usual tactics of over-the-top rhetoric that nobody believes.\u201d",
