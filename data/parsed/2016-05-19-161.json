  "body": "Alan Pardew expects to sign a new contract with Crystal Palace before leading his team out at Wembley in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final as they seek to secure the first major silverware in the club\u2019s 111-year history at Manchester United\u2019s expense. Terms were agreed with the manager in February over extending his stay at Selhurst Park beyond the expiry of his current deal, which runs through to the summer of 2018. The 54-year-old was reluctant to formalise the arrangement while Palace\u2019s Premier League status was in doubt, with the team enduring a marked slump since the turn of the year.   Related: Crystal Palace\u2019s Glad All Over Again to revive FA Cup final musical tradition    The side, who were joint fourth in mid-December, finished five points clear of the cut-off after a run of two league wins in 21 matches with their safety only mathematically secured on the campaign\u2019s penultimate weekend. Yet that spluttering form has not been replicated in the FA Cup, with Southampton, Stoke City and Tottenham Hotspur\u2013 who all finished in the top half of the league \u2013 defeated en route to the second FA Cup final in Palace\u2019s history. Pardew, who played in the 1990 side who lost to United in a replay, will only be without the injured Joe Ledley on Saturday. He hopes to sign a deal \u2013 most likely through to 2021 \u2013 that would also see a raise in salary, believed to be around \u00a31.5m a year at present. Palace paid Newcastle \u00a33.5m to release Pardew from his contract at St James\u2019 Park in January 2015 and Pardew hoisted the club from the relegation zone to a top-half finish last season. Survival this term meant a fourth successive season in the elite, matching the achievement of Steve Coppell\u2019s side between 1989-93. Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha will confront his former club at Wembley, with Pardew expecting the 23-year-old to deliver \u201ca big final\u201d to cap his most consistently impressive season yet as a senior player. The winger, who failed to make a Premier League start for United after Sir Alex Ferguson pushed through a \u00a315m move from Palace in January 2013, returned to the club last season, initially on loan, and has thrived under the current management. \u201cI know that Sir Alex still feels that Wilf is a Manchester United [standard] player,\u201d said Pardew of Palace\u2019s player of the season, whose contributions have played such a major role in propelling Palace to the final. \u201cHe can run fast all day. He\u2019ll run as fast in the first minute as he will in the 120th minute, and there aren\u2019t many who can do that. He can beat players for fun, he has a great physique. There\u2019s a lot going on there. He\u2019s probably an unfinished talent. \u201cHe wants to be training \u2013 he loves it \u2013 and lives and dies by football. But then there also is a part of him, which wants it to be about him. And if it ain\u2019t about him, then [he asks]: \u2018Why are we doing it?\u2019 When you are not in the team, as he wasn\u2019t at United, that might have been an issue for him, the manager [David Moyes and then Louis van Gaal] and the staff. I have tried to understand that with him and tried to educate him, that he has to do things in training that might not necessarily be built around him, and he has got better at that. \u201cHe also doesn\u2019t react well to disappointment. But this is a young player who has great talent. He is learning, and he has learned a lot this year. He has definitely got better for playing games and being in the frame of the first-team. Sometimes he still wanders around in training a little bit and I have to kick him up the bum or throw something at him. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem with Wilf now. His personality traits have improved around the group. That comes from us leaning on him, trying to give him information, senior players like [Emmanuel] Adebayor giving him little nuggets of information, and you grow as a player. He can have a big final, and I really hope he has one not just for Crystal Palace but for him personally.\u201d",
