  "body": "\u201cDr Corbyn\u2019s elixir for electoral success is killing the patient\u201d (Comment, last week, page 35) said that Labour had lost its majority in the National Assembly for Wales. To clarify: of the 60 available seats, Labour won 28 in 1999, 30 in 2003, 26 in 2007 and 30 in 2011. Labour therefore remains the largest single party, but has never had an outright majority. An analysis of last week\u2019s election results, \u201cEveryone can spin a victory as \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 fails to deliver any knockout blows\u201d (News, last week, page\u00a08), inadvertently referred to Wales as a principality. Although widely used as a synonym for Wales, there has not been a principality in Wales since the 16th century. It is a country in its own right. A cover story, \u201cThe loneliness of the working-class actor\u201d (New Review, last week, page 6), referred to Nina Gold as one of the most influential casting agents in Britain. She is a casting director. Apologies to readers in Scotland: because of a technical problem in the production process, Kevin McKenna\u2019s column failed to appear in print on page 37 of last week\u2019s Scottish edition (\u201cTo rise from the ashes, Labour must go on the offensive\u201d).
