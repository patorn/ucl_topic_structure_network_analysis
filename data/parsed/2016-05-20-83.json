Cooper\u2019s not the only one working on his deep-south lilt; Joe Gilgun of This Is England fame plays an Irish vampire named Cassidy who becomes Jesse\u2019s best friend; English rose Lucy Griffiths plays Emily, the deacon at Jesse\u2019s church and a possible love interest, while Ireland\u2019s Ruth Negga, known for Misfits, is Jesse\u2019s old flame and former partner-in-crime Tulip. All this is ironic given how profoundly American the adaptation of the classic comic book is \u2013 though the comic\u2019s creator, Garth Ennis, is British too.

All that is disturbed when he gets possessed by a supernatural force that gives him the power to command anyone to do anything he says: he literally has the voice and hand of God. Then Tulip descends to try and drag him back to his old ways (after kicking some serious ass by driving a hot rod through a corn field then felling a helicopter with a homemade bazooka). Making up our triumvirate, Cassidy crashlands bloodily in Jesse\u2019s backyard after leaping from a plane to escape a band of vampire hunters with just an umbrella for a parachute. Luckily, he drinks a cow\u2019s blood for sustenance, heals himself very quickly then offers his services as the church handyman.     Ruth Negga kicking some serious ass as Tulip O\u2019Hare. Photograph: Lewis Jacobs/Sony/AMC    Like the comics, the show is a strange stew of genres, ranging from action movie to western to gory horror to comedy. Cooper says this sometimes made things a little dodgy for him. \u201cOne minute I\u2019m being cut to pieces with a chainsaw, the next I\u2019m having a difficult discussion about religion,\u201d he says. Getting the tone right wasn\u2019t as easy as shuttling Cooper around the set in a golf cart. \u201cThat balance, which Garth pulls off in the comic, is our big challenge,\u201d says showrunner Sam Catlin, famed for Breaking Bad. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring it out as we go. There are a lot of people we stole from: David Lynch, Quentin Tarantino, Monty Python and the Coen Brothers.\u201d Catlin had never read the comic until Rogen and Goldberg pitched it to him. The pair were long-time Preacher fans and it was a passion project to bring it to the screen \u2013 something that had been attempted several times since the late 90s, by Sam Mendes among others, without coming to fruition. But their reverence made it hard to make changes. \u201cAt first, it seemed like an appalling notion to add to the world of Preacher,\u201d says Rogen. \u201cIt seemed crazy. As soon as Garth was like, \u2018Just change it,\u2019 he demystified that process \u2026 then it was like getting to play in your favourite sandbox.\u201d      Gangsters sent from heaven \u2026 Anatol Yusef as DeBlanc and Tom Brooke as Fiore. Photograph: Lewis Jacobs/Sony/AMC    Rogen says the series has more mystery than the comics. The character of Emily was added to throw in some colour to the church (in the comic, the entire congregation dies when Jesse is infected by the spirit that gives him superpowers). The villain Odin Quincannon (Jackie Earle Haley), who didn\u2019t appear until later in the comics, was moved front and centre \u2013 though fans will have to hold out for the biggest villain of all: God himself. That\u2019s another thing they had to soften. \u201cThe comics are decidedly more anti-religious than the show,\u201d says Rogen. \u201cThe show doesn\u2019t even have an opinion on it at this point.\u201d Cooper says that religion has never been a large part of his life, but he appreciates Jesse\u2019s journey. \u201cI love this show for the questions it raises and how it doesn\u2019t judge,\u201d he says, failing to fall squarely on either the side of the believers or the non-believers.     \u2018One minute I\u2019m being cut up with a chainsaw, the next I\u2019m having a discussion about religion\u2019 \u2026 Dominic Cooper as Jesse Custer and W Earl Brown as Hugo Root. Photograph: Lewis Jacobs/Sony Pictures Telev/AMC    While Cooper might be exploring new metaphysical territory, Catlin is in familiar territory, filming on location in Albuquerque, New Mexico \u2013 the home of Breaking Bad. He even stayed in the same hotel room overlooking the interstate. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go back to Albuquerque,\u201d says Catlin, afraid that Preacher would look too much like Breaking Bad or its spin-off, Better Call Saul. \u201cThis is a story that begins in west Texas and I didn\u2019t want it to seem like it was the AMC backlot in New Mexico. Now I think it feels pretty distinct.\u201d Catlin is very nervous of any comparison between the two shows. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stack it up against pretty much the greatest TV show of all time,\u201d he says, looking uncomfortable. \u201cPreacher is a romp. It\u2019s much broader. It\u2019s a much bigger world and it has bigger themes. Breaking Bad was very much about one man; Preacher is about a bunch of different things. I certainly try to steal as much as I can from [creator] Vince Gilligan and those amazingly talented people who worked on Breaking Bad. In fact, I hired a lot of those people.\u201d Now the show is filmed and poised to be AMC\u2019s next big hit, the only thing they have to worry about is whether fanboys will be angry about changes they\u2019ve made to the beloved comic. \u201cMy barometer for controversy has been readjusted in the past few years,\u201d Rogen jokes, referencing the firestorm his film The Interview started with Kim Jong-un and the North Korean government. \u201cUnless a world leader is calling for my head it\u2019s no big deal. If you have nuclear weapons then I\u2019m a little worried \u2026 a few angry nerds don\u2019t bother me.\u201d Preacher starts on Sunday at 10pm ET on AMC in the US,  on Sunday 22 May on AMC in Australia and Monday 23 May on Amazon Prime in the UK.",
