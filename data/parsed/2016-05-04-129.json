Oh, and the game\u2019s greats also like Donald Trump \u2013 and think Tiger Woods will win again.   Related: With friends like Michael Jordan, why would Tiger Woods need enemies? | Marina Hyde    The revelations come from Sports Illustrated\u2019s\u00a0annual anonymous pro tour survey, published on Tuesday, where golfers can sound off on multiple topics without being unmasked. SI polled more than 150 players across three American tours, and, unsurprisingly, a strongly Republican bent emerged from the survey. Forty-four percent of LPGA Tour players said they will not be voting for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, against 33% who will be, and 23% who gave no response. \u201cAbsolutely fucking not,\u201d opined one anonymous responder. Players on the men\u2019s tours were asked: \u201cIf Clinton\u00a0could guarantee to cut your taxes in half and the Republican candidate would keep them the same, would you vote for\u00a0her?\u201d Fifty-six percent of PGA players said no, while a massive 74% of players on the Champions Tour \u2013 the tour for players aged 50 and over \u2013 said the same. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote for [Clinton] if she were the last person on Earth,\u201d said one older gentleman. But there was no such problem for Donald Trump, whose various misdeeds didn\u2019t seem to bother the golfers profiled in the survey. Sixty-seven percent of players on the women\u2019s tour said that the LPGA should hold tournaments on courses owned by Donald Trump, while\u00a045% of players on the PGA Tour, and 88% of players on the Champions Tour, didn\u2019t think the WGC-Cadillac should be moved from the Trump National Doral resort in Miami because of the Republican frontrunner\u2019s controversial \u2013 nay, offensive \u2013 positions on women, immigration and race. \u201cNo,\u201d said one player. \u201cI love that golf course.\u201d Thirty-four percent of Champions Tour players are supporting Trump in the Republican primaries, 22% are undecided, 12% are going for Kasich, and 10% will be disappointed now Ted Cruz has suspended his campaign. Only 22% of Champions Tour players answered \u201cnone\u201d, while one player said he\u2019d be voting for \u201canyone who can beat a Democrat.\u201d Among the other themes that emerged:  Adam Scott has the PGA Tour\u2019s prettiest swing. Players\u2019 caddies on balance deserve 10% of the winner\u2019s check. Phil Mickelson would make a better Ryder Cup captain than Woods. Jordan Spieth is held in slightly higher regard than Rory McIlroy.  Also, the players remained positive about the fortunes of the game\u2019s biggest names.\u00a0Sixty-four percent of LPGA players believe Michelle Wie will win another major, while 42% of PGA players feel Woods will win another PGA event, compared to 27% who don\u2019t. Having said that, one player did say: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic, but running out of reasons.\u201d",
