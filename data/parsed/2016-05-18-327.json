  "body": "More than 30 environmental groups have signed a statement demanding that agreements allowing the logging of Australian native forests not be renewed. Australia\u2019s 10 regional forestry agreements (RFAs) were signed between 1997 and 2001, each running for 20 years, with the first two expiring in 2017. The agreements between state and federal governments mean proposals to log in designated native forests aren\u2019t required to be approved through the usual federal process, under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). The agreements were trumpeted as establishing the \u201cconservation and sustainable management of Australia\u2019s native forests\u201d with the aim of providing \u201ccertainty for forest-based industries, forest-dependent communities and conservation\u201d.

Photograph: Department of Agriculture and Water Resources    But a damning 50-page report produced last week by the National Parks Association of NSW concluded the agreements failed in all their aims, with the logging of native forests they facilitated resulting in an increase in threatened species.   Related: Threatened species: we do have time to turn it around if there is political will | Margaret Blakers    The report\u2019s lead author, ecologist Oisin Sweeney, examined scientific papers as well as the logging industry\u2019s own data, and found the RFAs cost the states huge sums, didn\u2019t decrease disputes over logging and worsened the environmental outcomes. The report also noted the agreements, which were designed in the 1990s, didn\u2019t take climate change into account, and logging of native forests is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. The federal government\u2019s current policy is to extend the RFAs when they expire. The report concluded that \u201cwould constitute an irrational decision on environmental, economic and social grounds\u201d. The statement, signed by more than 30 environment groups, was sent to the environment minister, Greg Hunt, Labor\u2019s environment spokesperson, Mark Butler, and the Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson, Janet Rice. \u201cThe groups endorsing this statement will not accept extension, rollover or renewal of regional forest agreements. Any future proposal to log public native forests should be subject to commonwealth environmental laws in the same way as for all other industries,\u201d the statement said. Labor has not announced a policy on the expiring RFAs, and Butler did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment. The Liberal party has said they would extend the RFA\u2019s and also did not respond to a request for comment. The Greens have said they oppose the RFA\u2019s extension or renewal. \u201cThe Greens stand with the Australian Forests and Climate Alliance in calling on the government to end this failed management scheme,\u201d said Rice.  \u201cNot even the mining industry has the sort of wildlife protection exemptions enjoyed by the native forest logging industry, so it is no wonder so many of our iconic birds and animals are on the brink of extinction because of habitat loss. \u201cMore than 85% of Australia\u2019s wood products now come from plantation sources and there is no reason we can\u2019t make the full transition out of native forest logging, to conserve these natural landscapes for their long-term environmental and economic values \u2013 carbon storage, water, wildlife, recreation and tourism.\u201d  Lorraine Bower of the Australian Forests and Climate Alliance called for an end to logging in native forests. \u201cBy giving the logging industry unfettered access to public forests over the 20 years of the RFAs, other industries that could support jobs and growth, such as the carbon market and tourism, have been stymied,\u201d she said.   Related: Bob Brown: police drop charges over protest at logging site    \u201cThe RFAs act as a loophole excluding logging from accountability to federal environmental laws that would apply to any other industry, enterprise or individual landowner.\u201d  But the forestry industry said the agreements had delivered excellent environmental outcomes. Ross Hampton, the chief executive of the industry\u2019s peak body, the Australian Forest Products Association, said the agreements went too far and had left too little of the forests available to be logged. \u201cThe available multiple-use forest has shrunk dramatically. Twenty years ago it was more than 13m hectares, now it is about 7.5m hectares nationally. And of course the timber communities only operate in a minute fraction of that on any year, harvesting about half of 1% and then assiduously resowing with the same species,\u201d he said. Hampton said that left the communities that relied on logging native forests with too little. \u201cWith this discussion of RFAs, it is also timely to stand back and look again at our forests and ponder if we are getting the balance right. \u201cBecause we replant or resow some 60m trees a year, the forest industries of this country can put hand on heart and claim to be the \u2018greenest\u2019 industry we have. We are a big part of the solution to the globe\u2019s chronic problems of climate change and rampant resource use.\u201d  \u2022 This article was amended on 24 May 2016 to add a response from the industry body Australian Forest Products Association.",
