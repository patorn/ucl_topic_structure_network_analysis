Fifty years ago, Indonesia went through a genocide. The massacres may be relatively unknown, but in a terrible way the destruction continues, and threatens us all. In 1965, the Indonesian army organised paramilitary death squads and exterminated between 500,000 and 1 million people who had hastily been identified as enemies of General Suharto\u2019s new military dictatorship. Today, the killers and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are comfortable establishment figures whose impunity, political power and capacity for intimidation endure. Over this past year the lawlessness that began with the genocide arrived in all our lives. Some 130,000 forest fires in Indonesia darkened the skies over much of south-east Asia last summer and autumn, destroying more than 8,100 square miles of virgin rainforest \u2013 an area larger than New Jersey or Wales. The fires released more than 1.75 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, equal to the total annual emissions of Japan. While last year\u2019s fires were the worst on record, fires on a similar scale have burned annually for nearly 20 years, making a mockery of our efforts to curb global warming.   Related: It is 50 years since the Indonesian massacre of 1965 but we cannot look away | Laksmi Pamuntjak    The fires are started by Indonesian and international companies to burn rainforest and replace it with oil palm plantations. Palm oil is the world\u2019s most commonly used plant-based oil, and the market for it has exploded along with the global middle class. Setting fires is the cheapest way to clear land for new oil palm plantations. Although Indonesia has strict laws aimed at keeping the fires in check, the laws exist on paper only. The companies get away with burning the forest because they work in partnership with the military \u2013 an institution that, ever since the genocide, has committed human rights violations with alarming regularity. These recurring atrocities keep the military feared \u2013 and above the law. Since 1965, multinational companies have collaborated with the armed forces to seize land and exploit a cheap labour force too afraid to demand safe working conditions or a fair wage. (Land is also seized for other lucrative, often illegal uses, mainly timber concessions and mines, which are similarly destructive of the environment.) And thus the military and its corporate partners get away with appalling corruption and unspeakable ecological crimes. For 50 years the capacity to terrorise has determined the distribution of wealth and power. While palm oil producers and their military partners profit from the fires, the people of Indonesia pay an incalculable price. Last year\u2019s inferno spread an unremitting, sickening haze over 43 million people. Half a million sought care for respiratory illnesses, while an average of 110,000 south-east Asians die every year as a result of the conflagration. And the never-ending rows of oil palm spread brutally exploitative labour conditions \u2013 including child labour and poisoning by lethal herbicides and pesticides. Meanwhile, the deforestation has critically endangered a third of Indonesia\u2019s mammals. And, according to Pep Canadell, director of the Global Carbon Project, the fires were \u201cthe global tipping point\u201d that will push the world beyond 2C of warming, and squarely into the acknowledged danger zone for the planet\u2019s climate.    A few companies have started eliminating conflict palm oil from their products, but most remain recalcitrant    This is both the world\u2019s worst ecological disaster and a human rights catastrophe \u2013 and we are all implicated. We benefit from this rule of fear and the destruction of the forests by consuming many of Indonesia\u2019s exports. Palm oil is used in many beauty products, snacks and desserts from companies like Starbucks, PepsiCo, McDonald\u2019s, Domino\u2019s Pizza, Unilever, and countless others. While a few companies have started to make meaningful strides towards eliminating conflict palm oil from their products, most remain recalcitrant \u2013 to the detriment of Indonesians and our global ecosystem. The fires and the exploitation must be stopped, yet the institutions meant to hold corporations and the military accountable are deliberately kept weak. Those who ought to police the country \u2013 the courts, civil servants and elected officials \u2013 are often the very ones who encourage, and profit from, its ruination.

Nor has he yet made good on his campaign promise to punish human rights abuses, including the 1965 genocide. He has refused to establish a truth commission, let alone consider proceedings against perpetrators. That means impunity is still the norm, and as if to prove the point, the Indonesian government recently announced that man-made fires in the rainforests have begun again \u2013 and burn today.

The release of my films The Act of Killing (2013) and The Look of Silence (2015) in Indonesia has stimulated a national discussion about the genocide and the consequences of impunity. According to Indonesian cultural commentator Ayu Ratih, the thousands of screenings across the country have been, for the younger generation, a rite of passage, \u201can initiation to adulthood which makes them feel more mature, socially and politically\u201d. This younger generation will no longer accept silence and inaction, and recently we have seen mounting public pressure on the government. Just this month Indonesian officials convened, for the first time ever, a symposium to examine the killings. Members of President Widodo\u2019s cabinet, Indonesia\u2019s attorney general, police chief, and justice minister attended the conference \u2013 as did NGO activists, former military leaders, survivors and families of those killed. While it was an unprecedented gathering, it is still only a small step toward ending the lawlessness that began in 1965. The government refused to apologise, and no steps were taken toward true accountability. Indonesia\u2019s movement against impunity has a long struggle ahead. Our survival as a species may depend on its success.",
