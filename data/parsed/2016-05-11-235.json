  "body": "Rachel Rendell, personal assistant at Hedsite Press, explains why Richard Heddington should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:   Richard has just published his first children\u2019s book \u2018Henry The Hedgegnome Has A Busy Day\u2019 and being the hard worker he is, the next books in the series will be out in no time.  He has really impressed me with his branding of Henry, through the Hedgegnome website and the blogs you will find there.  The demand for the book has been great so far, with local schools inviting him to read to the children on World Book Day.  I see this little character grabbing the attention of children of all ages. Richard spends every spare minute of his day building awareness of Henry and his adventures, and I would love to see him win in this category.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
