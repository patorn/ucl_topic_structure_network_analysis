  "body": "You may think of parish councils as a quintessential feature of rural Britain, but following government spending cuts and local referendums, these small, local government bodies are now springing up in cities across the UK. Just a couple of years ago, local residents in Queen\u2019s Park, London, voted to create the first urban parish council \u2013 and there are now a total of five urban parish councils. Since then the parish has hosted a number of seasonal festivals, fireworks displays, gardening projects and grants schemes to help the local community.   Related: Queen's Park: home of London's first parish council    \u201cLocal solutions are best for local problems,\u201d says Angela Singhate, clerk of Queen\u2019s Park parish council. Just like those living in the countryside, city dwellers are keen to welcome more control over their communities, she adds. But getting to this stage hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cMany parish councils around England have been in existence for a hundred years and setting up such an historic structure has been no mean feat,\u201d says Singhate. The success of this city government body has sparked interest from other urban councils. \u201cAfter we started up, we have been contacted by groups in areas such as Barking, Hackney and Holborn \u2013 all wanting to find out if the parish council model is a viable option for their communities,\u201d says Singhate. In both Salisbury and Shrewsbury, similar urban parishes have been set up to give back control to local residents. \u201cThis growth in parish councils shows people\u2019s growing desire for decisions to be made at a local level,\u201d says Helen Ball, clerk of Shrewsbury town council.  Meanwhile Reg Williams, clerk of Salisbury city council, says the desire for urban parishes comes from people feeling their voices aren\u2019t being heard by larger authorities. \u201cAnd people in general want decisions made at a more grassroots level,\u201d he says.    The pressure on larger or urban parish councils in particular to take on more and more services is going to intensify  Reg Williams, Salisbury city council     These parish councils maintain and provide parks, seasonal arts festivals and sports grounds for the cities \u2013 they also allow decisions to be made by the very people they represent. Urban dwellers are already seeing the benefit. \u201cThe winners out of all of this is the resident,\u201d says Williams. Not only do city dwellers get the chance to have more of a say about local issues and developments, but they also get access to a host of events and services managed by the parish. Some urban parishes have even started publishing their own news. \u201cWe have a group of volunteers who produce a quarterly newsletter about local projects \u2013 like our summer festival and community gardening project \u2013 and deliver this to every household,\u201d says Singhate. \u201cPeople love hearing about the local community and having the chance to get involved.\u201d In 2015, the parish council also introduced a grants scheme where people can apply for funding to deliver projects that benefit the community. Protecting services Parish councils in cities are also increasingly needed to protect vital public services, under threat of closure due to central government cuts, such as libraries, museums, leisure centres, swimming pools and youth centres. \u201cUrban parish councils are essential to determine whether these services are valuable and worth saving,\u201d says Ball.   Related: The rise of the parish council    Williams agrees that protecting services is becoming a critical role for urban parishes. \u201cWith government funding to principal authorities reducing, and likely to continue to do so, the pressure on larger or urban parish councils in particular to take on more and more services is going to intensify.\u201d This will put more pressure on local governors, but Williams says these decisions are better made at a local, rather than central, government level. \u201cParish councils are proving that they are both capable and able to not only take these services but deliver them in a more proactive, efficient and cost-effective manner.\u201d Because parish councils work at a grassroots level, and involve local residents, they can react much quicker to situations that arise in the community, adds Williams. As principle authorities are becoming ever larger and more dependent on central government, city parishes help to give residents back control by providing a truly local element in local government, says Williams.  However, currently these councils still remain in the minority. \u201cWe are the first and remain the only parish council in London,\u201d says Singhate. Ball agrees that most urban parishes are still in the very early stages. \u201cSome, like Shrewsbury and Salisbury, were created as part of the creation of unitary county councils, and recently in large populous places like Sutton Coldfield and Kidderminster [councils] have been created following local referendums.\u201d   Related: What is local government and how can you get involved?    With city residents being increasingly affected by public sector cuts, this may encourage more city-based councils to hold referendums to create new parishes. The appeal of a grassroots local government making decisions \u2013 even in urban areas \u2013 is that decisions are made for the community, by the very people who live within it. \u201cHaving local governors also enforces the view that the council really cares,\u201d says Ball. Amid government cuts and changes to services, urban parish councils are seen as consistency for in the areas they serve, she adds. \u201cPublic trust and confidence in government has risen as a result.\u201d Through offering local city gardening projects, firework displays and seasonal festivals \u2013 along with protecting essential public services \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt that UK cities stand to benefit as much as rural areas from governance at the smallest, and most personal, level.
