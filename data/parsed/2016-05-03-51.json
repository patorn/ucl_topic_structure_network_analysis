  "body": "I am writing regarding your editorial (The Guardian view on Mexico\u2019s missing students: justice indefinitely deferred, 29 April). I would like to share with your readers the following important points: 1 The government of Mexico is absolutely committed to a transparent and in-depth investigation, which is still\u00a0open and will not end until all the implicated individuals are punished. 2 Justice has not been deferred whatsoever. Up to 168 people have now been charged, 123 have been arrested \u2013 including most of the presumed perpetrators \u2013 and more than 1,500 search missions have been performed. 3 It was the Mexican government that\u00a0requested technical assistance from\u00a0the Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IACHR), which later integrated with the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI \u2013 its\u00a0acronym in Spanish). 4 The Mexican government will thoroughly review and consider each and every one of the recommendations made by GIEI. 5 President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has emphasised and reiterated his permanent commitment to the families of the victims. 6 Every alleged act of torture against detainees will be investigated by the Mexican special unit of investigation on\u00a0torture crimes (created in October 2015).Diego Gomez PickeringAmbassador of Mexico to the UK \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
