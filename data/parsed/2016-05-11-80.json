  "body": "The forklift truck driver who escaped from the wreckage of the collapsed racking (Forklift driver survives eight-hour ordeal by cheese, theguardian.com, 6\u00a0May) probably owes his life to the safety cage of his truck, not to some divine intervention. Great news that he survived, and it makes a good story, but the real question is, what were the conditions that led to the collapse? Pallet racking will not collapse if it is correctly designed, installed, operated and maintained. There are many possible causes \u2013 overloading, damage, pallet specification and condition, inspection and repair regime, incorrect loading practices and more.
