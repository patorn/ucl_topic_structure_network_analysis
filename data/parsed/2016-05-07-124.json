  "body": "It is unnerving when other road users openly laugh in your face, particularly if you think you\u2019re driving perfectly normally. In Ramsgate, I thought it was because the Volvo XC90 was bright red. A red car is one thing, but a gigantic red car is another, and the only person who would warm to it is the one who chose it. In Broadstairs, I thought it might be because I was just about to get wedged down a narrow road. In London, I thought perhaps it was the manifest power of the thing, so unnecessary for one whose greatest towing load would be if they accidentally hooked on to a trolley in an Asda car park. Whatever, OK: the point is, wherever I went, people laughed, and after a couple of days of this, I was no longer unnerved. I loved it. Eat my dust, laughing boys (or girls). I have an eight-speed automatic gearbox, and I know how to use it (by doing nothing). I have a driving experience so noiseless that I could be in space. I can accelerate so that my two-litre diesel D5 engine makes your\u2026 your whatever it is you\u2019re driving\u2026 look like a camper van packed with a hen party. I can go so fast without realising that\u2026 well, I would never do that. But it would be fast. This car turned me into Ayn Rand. All I could think about was my date with destiny. I also had the most intuitive, well-designed satnav I\u2019ve yet encountered, to direct me to destiny, as well as a truly impressive stereo system, bluetoothing effortlessly with devices, so that should I ever reach destiny, I would soon find I\u2019d rather stay in the car. The boot whooshes open with a button and the leathery seats hold you like a pitching glove. Volvo was famous for its safety \u2013 that, and all the leather, and heated seats for elk weather. But safety was the last thing on my mind in this beast, though luckily the car had that covered, with a symphony of alarms to tell me things I already knew, like, I was changing lanes without indicating. It was so noisy that, by the end of the week, the intro to most songs made the children think I was about to crash into something. But that\u2019s fine, because having anxieties about cataclysmic events is nothing, compared with the upside of being able to climb all over a car and pretend you\u2019re in a house. It\u2019s a tank, it\u2019s all those things people hate in an SUV from the outside, and love from the inside. I would sooner have died than enjoy it, until I started to really, really enjoy it.
