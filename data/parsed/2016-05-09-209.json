  "body": "It\u2019s been rumoured for months, but on Friday, Electronic Arts confirmed that the next title in its Battlefield series of military shooters will be set during the first world war. While the rival Call of Duty titles have been marching ever further into the future, Battlefield 1 is an attempt to re-engage with fans of the genre, who fell for titles like Battlefield 1942, Medal of Honor and the original Call of Duty games with their depiction of historically authentic scenarios. \u201cThis was the dawn of all-out war, the switch from the old world to the new world,\u201d says creative director Lars Gustavsson. \u201cBattlefield has always been about the land, sea and air war experience. This was something we had to do.\u201d According to Gustavsson, this project has been bubbling under for several years, though when Battlefield 4 came to a close, it gave the team the opportunity to start on something new. \u201cThe Battlefield series started during the second world war,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Vietnam, we\u2019ve been to contemporary warfare, we\u2019ve been into the future with Battlefield 2142 \u2013 we\u2019ve proven that the concept is clearly transferable.     \u2018The more we dug, the more discovered about the variety of combat, the locations, the forces at play\u2019 - Lars Gustavsson. Photograph: Electronic Arts    \u201cBut for us, the first world war was a global conflict; there were many locations and battles that we only discovered as we started work on the project. The more we dug, the more discovered about the variety of combat, the locations, the forces at play. We needed to have trench warfare \u2013 we wanted to depict that. But there are also more exotic and less known locations such as the Arabian deserts and the Italian Alps.\u201d The team also started to research the weapons and equipment of the era, to see if the Battlefield approach to combat \u2013 multiple player classes, all with different arms and items \u2013would work. \u201cThis was a time in which weapons were invented out of necessity,\u201d says Gustavsson. \u201cThere was long-range fighting in fields, fighting through forests. Weapons like machine guns and shotguns were invented to keep pace.    Unexplored weapons turned up in our research. Russian forces starting the war using horses and medieval clubs ...  Lars Gustavsson     \u201cAll of these unexplored weapons and tools that many people haven\u2019t even heard of turned up in our research. There\u2019s such a sense of advancement, from Russian forces starting the war using horses and medieval clubs to the end where the biggest aeroplane battles took place, where there were massive tank charges and naval battles \u2013 it lends itself perfectly to Battlefield. \u201cYou will be able to take part in a cavalry charge. But we\u2019re also shaping some of the biggest vehicles we\u2019ve ever built. These gigantic land ships, these beast-like tanks that rolled through the front line with the infantry behind them \u2013 it was a whole different angle on the battlefield. We have a wide variety of tanks \u2013 it\u2019ll almost be a rock-paper-scissors dynamic. It\u2019ll be about how you tackle these challenges in an ever-changing battlefield.\u201d It seems that Battlefield 1 will accentuate the design style of previous titles, with large sandbox environments, supporting 64 players, and four primary player classes: Assault, Medic, Scout and Support. While Battlefield 4 made certain areas of each map destructible, development studio EA Dice is looking to build environmental damage into the gameplay on a much wider scale. \u201cI would argue that it\u2019s more important than ever for Battlefield to have a dynamic environment,\u201d says Gustavsson. The amount of shells that were fired by artillery during these battles is ridiculous. The amount of explosive destruction was far beyond anything in other wars. We had to improve our dynamic sandbox. This is a battlefield that continually changes, where you have to adapt to survive. We wanted to push the idea that you must really use the environment to outsmart your enemies. The mantra for us has always been, no two battles are ever the same.\u201d     It is too early to speculate on how some of the most destructive battles in military history will be explored. Photograph: Electronic Arts    Alongside the multiplayer, Battlefield 1 is set to include what Gustavsson claims is a significant single-player mode. In the past the series has been criticised for its short and unengaging campaigns. This time, the designers are going for a broader, less linear experience that gets closer to the feel of the multiplayer component. \u201cWe wanted to add more Battlefield into the campaign experience \u2013 more variety, more vehicle gameplay, more choice to go along with our bigger environments,\u201d he says. \u201cWe love those Battlefield moments where the player experiences something unique that they can re-tell to others later on. We wanted a campaign that would revolve around those moments. We wanted to tell the story of several different people and how they react to the world changing around them. It\u2019s about more freedom and different angles on what this war was all about.\u201d Apart from the bombastic trailer, EA Dice is giving very little away about how the game will depict this war, in all its complexity and brutality. It is too early to speculate on how some of the most destructive battles in military history will be explored. At this stage, Gustavsson simply concedes the huge importance of the conflict. \u201cWe saw four great empires vanishing, a new world was born,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a time more relevant to us than many are aware of.\u201d Battlefield 1 is launched on PC, PS4 and Xbox One on 21 October.",
