Experts in military law, however, say West Point has overreacted to any supposed connection to the Black Lives Matter movement, and no regulation was broken. One such expert called the inquiry \u201ca tempest in a teapot\u201d. \u201cI think if there had been a bunch of white boys in their cadet uniforms, or footballers, this would not have been an issue,\u201d said Rachel VanLandingham, a retired air force lieutenant colonel and judge advocate and associate law professor at Southwestern Law School. \u201cBut because it\u2019s black women \u2026\u201d VanLandingham called the investigation \u201ctone deaf\u201d, and added of the academy: \u201cThey still do not know how to handle women and minorities in the military.\u201d  In the photo, according to West Point tradition for those about to graduate, the women wear grey uniforms and pose on the steps of the historic Nininger Hall, home to the Center for the Professional Military Ethic.  A number of such photos, in one of which the cadets\u2019 fists were raised, were uploaded to social media. The clenched fist salute has long been associated with the Black Power movement. This year it was used by Beyonc\u00e9 in her half-time show at the Super Bowl.  According to military rules, \u201cmembers on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity\u201d. Speaking about suggestions the cadets were actively supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, however, a West Point student mentor, Mary Tobin, told the Associated Press the raised fist was merely \u201ca sign of unity\u201d. \u201cThe raised fist doesn\u2019t, in my opinion, constitute a per se political statement,\u201d said Eugene Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School and is Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s attorney. \u201cIt\u2019s more an ethnic solidarity symbol.\u201d Geoffrey Corn, a military law professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston, said: \u201cThat clenched fist can mean a lot of different things. \u201cYou have a group of highly successful, hard-working, devoted young African American women who\u2019ve accomplished something that an infinitesimal number of their peers would ever accomplish and they were using that [fist] as a symbol of their cohesiveness and solidarity.\u201d After four years at the notoriously intense school, the cadets are due to graduate on 21 May. On Saturday, the school said officials were \u201cconducting an inquiry\u201d to establish if any wrongdoing took place.  On Monday, the college told the Guardian the inquiry, which began on 28 April, was ongoing. Fidell called the affair a \u201ctempest in a teapot\u201d and said: \u201cLooking at the photograph, I don\u2019t see anything punishable in it.\u201d  If the students are disciplined, VanLandingham said, it will probably be with an administrative punishment such as counseling. She did not believe the photo showed evidence of the women displaying \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman\u201d or was \u201cservice-discrediting\u201d. Once a cadet has graduated, VanLandingham noted, any minor infringements are wiped clear.   Related: He today that sheds his blood with me: when West Point rugby went to war    Richard Rosen, a professor of law at Texas Tech University and director of the Center for Military Law and Policy, said the photo perhaps showed poor judgment over how others may interpret it, but that minor counseling should be the extent of any punishment. \u201cThey just need to be aware of how they\u2019re going to be perceived, especially by future subordinates,\u201d said Rosen, a former colonel at the US military\u2019s Judge Advocate General\u2019s Legal Center and School. Part of the problem with the photograph, VanLandingham said, is the political connotation that a mainly white and older audience has given it, via social media.  Corn said: \u201cThey were doing what athletes do when they scored the winning touchdown: \u2018Here we are, we made it, we\u2019re part of the legacy!\u2019 [They were] never, ever expecting this thing would explode this way.\u201d",
