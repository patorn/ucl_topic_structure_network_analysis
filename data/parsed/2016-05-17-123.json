  "body": "The winner: Marvel \u2013 yet again   Related: Marvel axed female villain from Iron Man 3 after fears of poor toy sales, says director    Decent weather and a lack of strong commercially appealing new releases saw a continuing decline in UK box office, down 13% on the previous session, and 33% below the equivalent frame from 2015, when Pitch Perfect 2 topped the chart. Disney Marvel\u2019s Captain America: Civil War resisted the challenge of Sony Animation\u2019s The Angry Birds Movie, hanging on to the top spot for the third week, and with a decent 42% decline. After 17 days, the box office is a robust \u00a332.2m. Civil War is the fourth 2016 release to cross \u00a330m here, following Deadpool, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and The Jungle Book. Civil War is just behind the pace of Batman v Superman, which stood at \u00a333.3m at the same stage of its run. The runner-up: The Angry Birds Movie            Sony\u2019s adaptation of the Rovio game debuted with a so-so \u00a32.12m. The biggest animated hit so far this year is Disney\u2019s Zootropolis, which debuted in March with \u00a35.31m, including previews of \u00a31.73m. The Angry Birds Movie would probably have made a splashier debut had it arrived in 2013 when development of the film was announced \u2013 but lengthy production schedules for animated features tend to resist any attempt by studios to speed them up. The 2016 champ: The Jungle Book           Jon Favreau: \u2018Whenever I hear Garry Shandling\u2019s voice in The Jungle Book, it\u2019s sobering\u2019    Still in the box-office top three in its fifth week of play, and with \u00a339.3m, Disney\u2019s The Jungle Book has just overtaken Fox-Marvel\u2019s Deadpool (\u00a337.9m) to become the biggest hit of the year so far. Takings were just 24% down on the previous weekend \u2013 evidence that audience word of mouth continues to hold up on the Rudyard Kipling adaptation. The film looks certain to overtake the lifetime total of Alice in Wonderland (\u00a342.5m) and could well catch The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe (\u00a344.4m) \u2013 two family titles that far exceeded box-office expectations. The also-rans A quintet of mid-size films was released collectively on 721 screens, delivering a poor total of \u00a3783,000, including previews. Best result was achieved by John le Carr\u00e9 adaptation Our Kind of Traitor, starring Ewan McGregor, Naomie Harris, Damian Lewis and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd: \u00a3358,000 from 245 sites, yielding an average of \u00a31,461.           Damian Lewis in a clip from John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s Our Kind of Traitor    Critical support couldn\u2019t push Richard Linklater\u2019s campus comedy Everybody Wants Some!! very far, despite the director coming off the widely admired Oscar winner Boyhood. It debuted with \u00a3170,000 from 111 cinemas, but that includes \u00a335,000 in previews. For comparison, Boyhood kicked off in July 2014 with \u00a3333,000 from 89 cinemas. Commercial chances for the new film may not have been helped in the UK by the profusion of college baseball players among principal characters \u2013 a fact that the trailer could not hide. The look and feel of the film also appeared very male, and it was certainly a challenge to communicate the disarming sweetness that gradually emerges. Landing just inside the Top 10 is Jeremy Saulnier\u2019s 18-rated Green Room, starring Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots and Patrick Stewart. A debut of \u00a3145,000 from 136 sites includes previews of \u00a349,000. Strip those out, and the film\u2019s screen average falls to a weak \u00a3706.            All of the aforementioned new releases look like hits when compared with the two films that round out the quintet: Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and The Darkness. Both landed outside the Top 10. The former, a Tina Fey comedy drama based on US journalist Kim Barker\u2019s memoir The Taliban Shuffle, struggled to define its audience, debuting in 12th place with \u00a359,000 from 123 sites for a \u00a3478 average. Three places below it is horror title The Darkness, starring Jennifer Mason and Kevin Bacon, which kicks off with a limp \u00a351,000 from 106 sites, for a similar average of \u00a3486. MetaCritic score is a poor 28/100. It\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that, in at least a couple of cases, commercially problematic films were being pushed into the marketplace in what has been a relatively fallow period between Captain America: Civil War and the forthcoming X-Men: Apocalypse.  The future            Salvation for cinemas is surely at hand this week with X-Men: Apocalypse, the third in the series to feature James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, and the eighth appearance for Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine. Counter-programming alternatives include Dublin-set teen comedy Sing Street, from Once director John Carney, expanding to mainland UK having already racked up an impressive \u00a3857,000 in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
