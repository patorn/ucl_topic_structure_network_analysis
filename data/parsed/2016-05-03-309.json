  "body": "Claudio Ranieri has described winning the Premier League title as an \u201camazing feeling\u201d and paid tribute to his Leicester City players for completing one of the most remarkable stories in the history of English football. The Leicester manager, who flew back to England on Monday night after having lunch in Italy with his 96-year-old mother, Renata, admitted his players had surpassed all expectations and praised them for their spirit and determination.

It\u2019s an amazing feeling and I\u2019m so happy for everyone. \u201cI never expected this when I arrived. I\u2019m a pragmatic man, I just wanted to win match after match and help my players to improve week after week. Never did I think too much about where it would take us. The players have been fantastic. Their focus, their determination, their spirit has made this possible. Every game they fight for each other and I love to see this in my players. They deserve to be champions.\u201d           \u2018Walt Disney wouldn\u2019t script this\u2019 \u2013 Leicester City champions    The Leicester players celebrated the greatest night of their footballing lives at Jamie Vardy\u2019s house, in Melton Mowbray, where they gathered to watch the Spurs match. Wes Morgan, who will be presented with the Premier League trophy after Saturday\u2019s home game against Everton, hailed the camaraderie within Ranieri\u2019s squad and said their spirit had been a key factor in staying up last season and now winning the title. \u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling of my career and I couldn\u2019t be prouder that it\u2019s as part of this team,\u201d said Morgan, the Leicester captain. \u201cEveryone\u2019s worked so hard for this, nobody believed we could do it, but here we are, Premier League champions and deservedly so. I\u2019ve never known a spirit like the one between these boys. We\u2019re like brothers. \u201cPeople saw it last season when everyone expected us to be relegated, but we fought back to prove people wrong. This season\u2019s been a continuation of that. We\u2019ve built on the momentum but I don\u2019t think anyone believed it would come to this. Saturday can\u2019t come quickly enough. I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on the trophy.\u201d For Vardy, who was named the football writers\u2019 player of the year earlier in the day, it is the latest chapter in a remarkable story; he has climbed from non-league football with Stocksbridge Park Steels to be a full England international and now a title-winner with Leicester. The footage of the celebrations in his kitchen when the final whistle was blown at Stamford Bridge captured just how much winning the title means to a group of players who could never have imagined that they would be in this position.

I\u2019ve never known anything like it,\u201d Vardy said. \u201cWe were scrapping to stay in the league last season and on Saturday we\u2019ll be lifting the trophy. That gives you an idea of how much hard work has gone into this season from every single player and member of staff. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest achievement in the history of a great club and we all feel privileged to be part of it. It\u2019s even more special to have done it with these lads. Every minute of hard work we\u2019ve put in on the training pitch has been worth it for this moment.\u201d Andy King, Leicester\u2019s longest-serving player and a survivor from their League One days, sounded like a man who was struggling to comprehend what had just happened. \u201cI thought I\u2019d seen everything with this club but I never thought I\u2019d see this,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put into words. The players deserve it, the gaffer and the staff deserve it and the fans deserve it. It\u2019s been an unbelievable season. \u201cThe story of where this team has come from to get to this point has been all over the world recently and I think the lads deserve great credit for the way they\u2019ve taken it in their stride, stayed focused and kept delivering results \u2013 especially with a great side like Spurs chasing us so hard. We\u2019ve been so consistent and just determined not to let the opportunity pass us by. We deserve this.\u201d",
