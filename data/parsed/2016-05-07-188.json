  "body": "When Angela Duckworth was growing up, her dad often applied the word genius to his daughter. He did it at random moments, over dinner, watching TV or reading the newspaper, and the sentence was always the same: \u201cYou\u2019re no genius!\u201d Duckworth\u2019s older sister and brother got it too. For Duckworth\u2019s mother, an artist, the disparagement was adjusted to fit: \u201cYou\u2019re no Picasso!\u201d This approach to raising children seems inauspicious but, in a funny way, it has worked pretty well. Duckworth, now 45, doesn\u2019t recall how she answered her father, but her book Grit is her considered reply. Subtitled The Power of Passion and Perseverance, the text is the fruit of years studying the psychology of success. Swimmers, chefs, army cadets, telesales executives \u2026 Duckworth examines them all, and what she finds is that natural talent \u2013 the genius prized by her father \u2013 does not make humans disposed to succeed so much as the qualities she sums up as \u201cgrit\u201d. These include the commitment to finish what you start, to rise from setbacks, to want to improve and succeed, and to undertake sustained and sometimes unpleasant practice in order to do so. She calls the people whose inspiring tales she recounts \u201cgrit paragons\u201d. But the most persuasive grit paragon, the one whose story is implicit rather than directly told \u2013 the book is social science not memoir \u2013 is Duckworth herself. Every family has its funny sayings, the private lore and logic that its members must negotiate. \u201cAt one level, you\u2019re a kid and you accept it,\u201d she says of her father\u2019s sniping, but she did register an emotional reaction: a silent, internal clench. \u201cInstead of feeling discouraged, I felt the opposite.\u201d Her voice brightens. \u201cI had the sort of \u2026 I\u2019ll show you \u2026 response.\u201d     Angela Duckworth with her parents.    The reaction has been Duckworth\u2019s life\u2019s work. She went to Harvard, where she founded a nonprofit summer school for low-income middle-school pupils. She left Harvard with the Fay prize for best female student, passed McKinsey\u2019s notorious selection process before swerving to teaching \u2013 \u201cCouldn\u2019t you at least be a senator?\u201d her dad pleaded \u2013 and from there research psychology, and Character Lab, a nonprofit she co-founded to advance the science and practice of character development. All along, she challenged her father, who worked as a chemist at Dupont. She recalls an argument, when she was 17, about the meaning of life. \u201cI said, \u2018I think the meaning of life is to be happy.\u2019 He looked at me surprised and puzzled. He said, \u2018Why would you want to be happy? I want to be accomplished.\u2019\u201d Duckworth claims \u201ca rebellious streak\u201d, but hers is not a classic tale of rebellion. It\u2019s much smarter than that. She has scientifically dismantled her father\u2019s premise, his coveting of genius, by proving the idea itself to be mistaken. And she has done it all while achieving everything \u2013 and more \u2013 he could have hoped for. Three years ago, she won a MacArthur fellowship, commonly known as \u201cthe genius grant\u201d \u2013 thereby proving him wrong on his terms and hers. Or did she? Is it possible that her father\u2019s relentless disparagement instilled in Duckworth the impetus to succeed? \u201cThat is an excellent question,\u201d she says, and immediately begins to improve it. \u201cI mean, the question is, would I have done so well \u2013 so far as I\u2019ve done \u2013 if my dad was just, like, \u2018You\u2019re great\u2019!\u201d She replies that she cannot know the answer, she can only reason. \u201cI do think that whatever ambition I may have had natively was amplified by my father\u2019s clear valuing of it. I knew that was what my dad really cared about.\u201d It is tempting to think that Duckworth\u2019s father \u2013 her parents were Chinese immigrants \u2013 used criticism to motivate his children. But Duckworth laughs at this idea. \u201cOh my God, my dad, I just don\u2019t think he thought about it. My dad was not super-intentional in his parenting. He was very self-absorbed. I won\u2019t say mean or selfish per se, but very self-absorbed. I think he was just thinking out loud.\u201d She came to understand \u201cyou\u2019re no genius\u201d as a self-rebuke. \u201cHe was thinking about the fact that he never won a Nobel prize in chemistry, which is hard to win when you\u2019re really working on car paint refinishing. When I was little, he was still climbing up the corporate ladder and he wasn\u2019t the man he wanted to be. And so he, I think, was feeling this inadequacy which he projected on to his children. You know: you\u2019re no genius, you\u2019re no nobel laureate.\u201d She always knew her parents loved her. This year her father turns 84. He has Parkinson\u2019s disease and lives with Duckworth\u2019s mother in an assisted living facility, a 45-minute trip from Duckworth\u2019s home in Philadelphia. It was there that Duckworth drove when she finished the book. \u201cHe likes to look outside, so I wheeled him to a window.\u201d Feeling a little afraid, she drew up a chair next to him, and opened Grit. Over several visits, she read and read, pausing to give her father a sip of water or if he fell asleep. \u201cHe seemed to be listening,\u201d she says. Didn\u2019t he say anything? Well, she says, now and then she asked what he thought and, \u201cHe sort of said \u2018wonderful\u2019.\u201d But there is a hole in her comprehension, a rare moment of inarticulacy. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure he\u2019s saying that because he knows exactly what I said or because he remembers that this is the sort of thing you say,\u201d she admits. Then she says, \u201cHe may even have uttered \u2018it\u2019s wonderful\u2019.\u201d I am confused as to whether he said \u201cwonderful\u201d or not. By now, their relationship feels like a long conflict, and this \u2013 the reading \u2013 is the final frontier. So it really matters. The next day I email Duckworth to check and she replies that she is \u201cnot entirely sure\u201d. She thinks he said it \u2013 the asterisks are hers and might indicate strength of thought, or simply emphasise that this is only a thought. Ever the scientist, she adds, \u201cI didn\u2019t video or audio tape reading it to him.\u201d It is odd to picture Duckworth, mild-mannered and sweet, sitting next to her father \u2013 \u201chis own daughter telling him things that are not altogether complimentary\u201d. But there was some closure for her, she says. \u201cThe one thing my dad has always been is brutally honest.\u201d She gives a small laugh. \u201cOr let\u2019s say unedited.\u201d His honesty brought advantages: as a child, Duckworth \u201calways felt she knew him\u201d and even though her mother was a saint, and \u201cgrowing up you would think I should be super close to her \u2026 Strangely I felt closer to my dad.\u201d It was his honesty that gave her the courage to read to him. As she says, \u201cI\u2019m still my father\u2019s daughter.\u201d Duckworth is a mother as well as a daughter, and in their house, Amanda, 15, and Lucy, 14, hear a lot about grit. \u201cI have gotten the complaint that I talk about grit all the time,\u201d Duckworth says. Maybe the word will function for them as genius did for Duckworth, and provoke a quiet, internal rebellion. \u201cHmm. \u2018I\u2019m going to be mediocre just to show you\u2019,\u201d she muses. \u201cI can imagine that might happen, but neither of my girls are all that rebellious, thank God.\u201d     Angela Duckworth with her father at Oxford.    The nearest either comes in the book is when Lucy, then four, tries to open a box of raisins. It\u2019s too difficult and she walks away. Duckworth tells her to try again. Lucy declines. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was rebellion,\u201d Duckworth says. \u201cBut she had a pronounced aversion to things that were hard.\u201d She describes another time, when Lucy was at maths club. \u201cWatching her through the crack of a door, doing these worksheets. She really didn\u2019t like effort. By the way, most animals don\u2019t like effort.\u201d Eyeing the raisin box, peeping through a crack in the door \u2013 what a watchful parent Duckworth is. \u201cI was observing them from the get-go,\u201d she says. She mentions the marshmallow test, which looks at delayed gratification. \u201cI did all those things. I was studying them but I was also trying to raise them.\u201d To avoid some of the mistakes of her own upbringing, Duckworth teaches her children grit. With her husband, Jason, she has developed \u201cthe Hard Thing rule\u201d. Each family member must choose a discipline \u2013 for Jason and Duckworth their work, for the girls an interest \u2013 and apply themselves to it. No one may quit until the activity has run its course. To anyone who has tried to persuade children to attend a club against their will, that rule itself sounds like a Hard Thing. Does Duckworth find it difficult to navigate between her belief that a child should persist at a task and the child\u2019s right to choose? \u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t had fights and tears about \u2018I hate this\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t want to do it\u2019,\u201d she says. Occasionally Duckworth shoots back: \u201cFine! If you\u2019re not going to practise then I think we should just call it quits!\u201d But neither daughter has capitalised on these outbursts to liberate themselves from their obligations. \u201cIn these tough moments, they have never said, \u2018OK, I\u2019m done.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to take credit for it necessarily because maybe they would have been like that without me saying these things, studying these things, but they really are learning to do things and they are learning to do them well, and they are learning to struggle a bit, and they are learning to have bad days and wake up the next day. I would be surprised if my girls ended up as women without grit. I really would.\u201d            If her father is unedited, Duckworth is the opposite. Her most overused phrase is \u201cI will say that \u2026\u201d as if what she voices is the result of a private, mental conference. And while the concept of genius doesn\u2019t figure much in her life, she occasionally experiences \u201ca marvelling, awestruck\u201d sensation. It can happen when she hears Adele singing. But never in regard to her daughters. \u201cNo,\u201d she says firmly. Though she is \u201cnot afraid to say things\u201d. Lucy, for instance, was up till after 11pm last night trying to make flour for macaroons. \u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to say, \u2018That\u2019s incredible to me how interested you are in baking,\u2019\u201d Duckworth says. \u201cBut I think the thing that\u2019s most useful to emphasise is this admiration for an interest and an admiration for the things they have done.\u201d Occasionally, she tells her daughters, \u201cYou really have a knack for this!\u201d The praise is so moderated it feels a little faint. Maybe life in a gritty house can be tough. \u201cI get tired,\u201d she says. \u201cStriving is exhausting. Sometimes I do say things like \u2018I wish I were not quite this driven to be excellent.\u2019 It\u2019s not a comfortable life. It\u2019s not relaxed. I\u2019m not relaxed as a person. I mean, I\u2019m not unhappy. But \u2026 it\u2019s the opposite of being comfortable.\u201d \u201cNot unhappy\u201d \u2013 the phrase brings to mind Duckworth\u2019s conversation with her father at 17, when she argued for happiness, he for accomplishment. If he was not the man he wanted to be, it is irresistible to wonder if she is the woman she wants to be. But the point of grit, true grit, is that no one ever gets there. \u2022 Grit by Angela Duckworth is published by Vermilion, \u00a320.

Parenting for grit: an extract from Angela Duckworth\u2019s Grit A young child\u2019s instinct to copy adults is very strong. In a classic psychology experiment conducted more than 50 years ago at Stanford University, for example, preschoolers watched adults play with a variety of toys and were then given the opportunity to play with the toys themselves. Half of the boys and girls watched an adult quietly play with Tinkertoys while ignoring a child-size, inflatable doll in the same room. The other half of the children watched the adult begin assembling the Tinkertoys and, after a minute, turn to viciously attack the doll. The adult pummelled the doll with his fists and then a mallet, tossed the doll up in the air and, finally, while screaming and yelling, aggressively kicked the doll about the room. When given an opportunity to play with the same toys, children who\u2019d seen adults play quietly followed suit. In contrast, children who\u2019d watched adults beat up the doll were likewise aggressive, in many cases so closely imitating violent adults they\u2019d seen earlier that researchers described their behaviour as carbon copies. And yet, there\u2019s a world of difference between imitation and emulation. As we grow older, we develop the capacity to reflect on our actions and pass judgment on what we admire and disdain in others. When our parents are loving, respectful and demanding, we not only follow their example, we also revere it. We not only comply with their requests, we also understand why they\u2019re making them. We become especially eager to pursue the same interests. Educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom and his team noted the same pattern in their studies of world-class performers. Almost without exception, the supportive and demanding parents in Bloom\u2019s study were \u201cmodels of the work ethic in that they were regarded as hard workers, they did their best in whatever they tried, they believed that work should come before play, and that one should work toward distant goals.\u201d Further, \u201cmost of the parents found it natural to encourage their children to participate in their favoured activities.\u201d Indeed, one of Bloom\u2019s summary conclusions was that \u201cparents\u2019 own interests somehow get communicated to the child \u2026 We found over and over again that the parents of the pianists would send their child to the tennis lessons but they would take their child to the piano lessons. And we found just the opposite for the tennis homes.\u201d It is indeed remarkable how many paragons of grit have told me, with pride and awe, that their parents are their most admired and influential role models. And it\u2019s just as telling that so many paragons have, in one way or another, developed very similar interests to those of their parents. Clearly, these exemplars of grit grew up not just imitating their parents but also emulating them. This logic leads to the speculative conclusion that not all children with psychologically wise parents will grow up to be gritty, because not all psychologically wise parents model grittiness. Though they may be both supportive and demanding, these parents may or may not show passion and perseverance for long-term goals. If you want to bring forth grit in your child, first ask how much passion and perseverance you have for your own life goals. Then ask yourself how likely it is that your approach to parenting encourages your child to emulate you. If the answer to the first question is \u201ca great deal,\u201d and your answer to the second is \u201cvery likely\u201d you\u2019re already parenting for grit.",
