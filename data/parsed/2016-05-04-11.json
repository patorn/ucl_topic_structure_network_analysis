  "body": "Manuel Pellegrini admitted Manchester City missed a rare opportunity to reach the Champions League final after they were knocked out by Real Madrid. City lost the semi-final second leg 1-0 \u2013 and the tie by the same score \u2013 due to Fernando\u2019s own-goal that came from a Gareth Bale shot after 20 minutes, with Vincent Kompany having been taken off 10 minutes earlier due to the 33rd injury of his time at the club. Pellegrini\u2019s side were uninspired throughout yet the Chilean insisted he had no regrets about the approach to the game. Instead he pointed to a lack of creativity from both teams but did concede disappointment at City failing to reach the showpiece in Milan on 28 May.

You need a little bit of luck but that wasn\u2019t the reason we couldn\u2019t win the game. Tonight and the game we played at the Etihad we saw very equal teams. I don\u2019t think Real Madrid demonstrated tonight that they are better than Manchester City. \u201cWe tried to create but we couldn\u2019t. Both teams couldn\u2019t create. It was similar in the first leg. We didn\u2019t deserve to lose this game, the goal was very lucky, a deflection into the top corner. Missing David Silva, [Samir] Nasri [who is not in the Champions League squad] and Yaya [Tour\u00e9] coming from an injury we didn\u2019t have creative players to make a difference. \u201cNo, there are no regrets, we worked very well for 90 minutes. That\u2019s why Real Madrid couldn\u2019t create any chances. But we needed to create in the final third and today we couldn\u2019t.\u201d This was only Kompany\u2019s second start following a knee problem that had ruled him out for a month. Yet the captain again went down with an injury that may prompt questions about his career. Pellegrini said: \u201cOf course it was not the best way to start the semi-final to lose your captain. But we didn\u2019t have any problem defending without Vincent. What we didn\u2019t have tonight was the creative players to make the difference. We\u2019ll see tomorrow what the problem is \u2013 maybe it\u2019s his groin rather than his calf.\u201d The defeat means Pellegrini has only two more matches left of his three-season tenure before he steps aside for Pep Guardiola. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a special season because we have reached the semi-final. I don\u2019t think that we deserved to reach the final but it was a bit of luck that Real will play in the final. \u201cOf course it would have been a very important achievement to play that final. It was very important for me to try to reach that final but we did what we could and now we must try to finish well.\u201d   Related: Vincent Kompany injury again highlights Manchester City\u2019s damning weakness | Jamie Jackson    City are in fourth place on 64 points, four ahead of Manchester United though they have played a game more. On Sunday Arsenal, who are third on 67 points with only two matches remaining, are at the Etihad. \u201cWe must now finish in the domestic games trying to qualify for next year,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cThis team must try to be in the final in the next years.\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo insisted Real deserved to go through. \u201cIt was a tough game but I think we played better than City,\u201d he said. Bale added: \u201cThe main thing is we have a chance to win the Champions League again. The reason I came to Real Madrid was to win Champions Leagues. I\u2019ve got one already and I have got another chance to win another. I feel like I am maturing. My Spanish is getting better and I\u2019m integrating more with the team. I feel like I have turned a corner in that sense and I\u2019m enjoying my football here.\u201d",
