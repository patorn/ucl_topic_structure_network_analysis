  "body": "Hi, Kelis. You\u2019re playing all sorts of UK festivals this year: I count seven. Any ideas which ones?  To be totally honest with you, I\u2019ve seen them on my schedule but I haven\u2019t memorised them. I know I\u2019m doing a lot \u2026 Well, let\u2019s pick some highlights. Kendal Calling takes place in a deer park in the Lake District. Do deer like your music?  I hope they like it. It would be really bad if they hated it and went into attack mode or something. Maybe I\u2019ll have to come up with something more spiritual than I normally do. Good eye-deer.  Ha. Honestly, I love festivals. The energy makes it feel more \u2013 what\u2019s the word? I guess it feels more like warrior-tisic, which is not a word. Having to fight the elements can make it so intense. Ah yes. The classic British festival \u201celements\u201d. Don\u2019t forget your wellies. What\u2019s been your worst experience?  The first time I played Glastonbury, in 2000, it rained a lot. Moby was on stage before me, and there was a sewage situation. There was literally poo everywhere. It was revolting. I still had to perform in that funk. So I think I can handle a little rain. Nicki Minaj demanded the grass was mown outside her trailer at T in the Park. Will you be making any such diva-ish demands?  No. When I do a festival, in my mind, I\u2019m camping. People are like: \u201cI like to camp.\u201d Me too. I love it. I do it all the time. What are your camping tips for a successful festival?  Make sure you wear something with feathers and sequins, no matter what time of day. Stilettoes are, obviously, essential. And always carry some antihistamines, because I\u2019m extremely allergic, and festivals bring out the worst in me. You\u2019ve described your last album, Food, as \u201ca kind of unspoken lovefest\u201d. Oo-er. Which track do you most recommend having an unspoken lovefest to?  Ooh. Maybe Biscuits N\u2019 Gravy. Strange name. Then again, other song titles include Jerk Ribs, Friday Fish Fry and Cobbler. Are you sure they didn\u2019t accidentally print your dinner party menu instead of the track listing? Ha. It was kind of a combination. We recorded in this big house and the kitchen was right next to the studio. Some of the time it was just stuff I wanted to be eating. Sometimes it was stuff we actually were eating or cooking. It\u2019s a celebration of food, really. You trained as a sous chef at Le Cordon Bleu and you\u2019ve written a recipe book too \u2013 My Life on a Plate: Recipes From Around the World. Mind if we chat some through?  Sure. Pineapple Beef. Literally \u2013 grab a pineapple and shove in some beef. Well, I mean, if you want to grossly oversimplify it, absolutely. Um, does it taste as good as it sounds? It\u2019s delicious, actually. It\u2019s something I had in Penang in Malaysia. They do a lot of fruit with protein. It seems like a good combination, it\u2019s a tropical place. It\u2019s not hard. The secret is to slice your beef really thinly before mixing it with the pineapple. Next: Shrimp Alcapurrias. What\u2019s wrong with scampi in a basket, or fish fingers? Well, yeah, it\u2019s nothing like fish sticks. The root is Yaut\u00eda [cocoyam], that\u2019s the casing. You shred a Yaut\u00eda and stuff it with the shrimp and it\u2019s almost like a dumpling kind of thing. Sounds delish. What would you cook if we were coming round for tea? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d have to go to the market and see what\u2019s fresh and what mood I\u2019m in. Do you have any dietary restrictions? Parsnips. Don\u2019t like parsnips. You don\u2019t like parsnips. Why, are they too waxy? No, cos you idly help yourself to one thinking it\u2019s a roast potato and then \u2013 hugely disappointing. Ha! Hugely disappointing. Hilarious. You also do a range of Bounty & Full sauces. Er, isn\u2019t it rude to ask for sauce? No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m American. My best friend is English and she\u2019s always: \u201cOh my god, you\u2019re SO USA.\u201d You shouldn\u2019t just sit there and not like what they put in front of you. I can\u2019t understand that. Why wouldn\u2019t you just ask? It\u2019s not rude. It\u2019s ruder for them to serve me something I don\u2019t want and expect me to eat it. She\u2019s like: \u201cYou\u2019re SO USA.\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cYeah, you\u2019re SO British.\u201d Thanks, Kelis. What would go in a Kelis milkshake? Apart from milk, obviously \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever made a milkshake. I made a smoothie the other day that was really good \u2013 protein powder, spinach, orange, and crushed ice with a little bit of honey and coconut water. I\u2019ll make you a Kelis smoothie next time you come over. Great. Can I have a milkshake after? I\u2019ll bring some Nesquik. Sure thing. Kelis plays Standon Calling, Kendal Calling and several other festivals.",
