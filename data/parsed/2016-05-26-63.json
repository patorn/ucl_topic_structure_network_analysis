  "body": "Time Test, who emerged as a leading three-year-old last season without registering a Group One success, gave 5lb and a head start to the field in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes here on Thursday night but still ran out an impressive winner on the way to a run in the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes at Royal Ascot next month.   Related: A Shin Hikari on course for Royal Ascot after Prix d\u2019Ispahan romp    The 10-furlong feature event on day two could be the best race of the meeting, as Time Test will now expected to join A Shin Hikari, the brilliant winner of the Prix D\u2019Ispahan earlier this week, at the starting gate. Found, who beat Golden Horn in last year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf, is also expected to run. Ryan Moore was happy to sit at the tail of the field for the first mile as Paul Hanagan made the running on Intilaaq, the favourite. As Intilaaq\u2019s exertions started to tell, the course specialist Western Hymn moved into the lead but Moore had judged his challenge to perfection and ran him down in the closing stages to win by a neck. Roger Charlton, Time Test\u2019s trainer, took the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes with Al Kazeem in 2013 and now has another obvious chance in the race. Time Test was cut to 11-2 from 10-1 with Paddy Power while A Shin Hikari is the favourite at a top price of 9-4. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take the easy route, which is good,\u201d Charlton said. \u201cI think a mile and a quarter is what brings the best out of him. We flirted with a mile last year and won a Group Two but, talking to Ryan, this is his trip. \u201cThe disappointing thing was seeing how wonderful the Japanese horse was, otherwise you\u2019d fancy yourself a bit in the Prince of Wales. He looked good there [at the Royal meeting] last year. \u201cHe\u2019s a year older, let\u2019s hope he\u2019s improving. Western Hymn ran a great race and was pretty fancied beforehand. They pulled a long way from the others and first time out, it was a good trial.\u201d Willie Mullins watched the National Hunt trainers\u2019 championship slip through his fingers on his last visit to Sandown Park and he suffered further disappointment as Max Dynamite, the runner-up in last season\u2019s Melbourne Cup, could finish only third of the four runners despite setting off at 4-7 for the Group Three Henry II Stakes. Max Dynamite was still going easily two furlongs out but offered little resistance as Pallasator, who had been held up by Oisin Murphy in a rare switch from front-running tactics, drew alongside and then strode two-and-a-quarter lengths clear of Suegioo. Mullins could only express the hope afterwards that Max Dynamite had \u201cblown up\u201d on his first start since November. Sir Mark Prescott, meanwhile, will now prepare Pallasator for a run in the Gold Cup at Ascot next month. Pallasator has been a notoriously headstrong and difficult horse for much of his career, in the preliminaries in particular, but while there were occasional traces of wilfulness here, he seems to be mellowing slightly with age. \u201cThe plan was to sit last and he quickened up well, so it couldn\u2019t have gone better,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those rare days when the plan works. He\u2019s not everybody\u2019s ride but Oisin made it look as easy as possible. \u201cHe is just getting old, like me, and I\u2019m less bad-tempered and I think he is probably, he\u2019s just a bit more civilized than he used to be. Andrea [Atzeni] said last year when he won the Doncaster Cup that if his name was down to ride him every day, he wouldn\u2019t come in to work. He has to have everything done for him, but if he\u2019s good enough to win Group races, he can have everything he wants.\u201d Pallasator is 16-1 (from 25-1) with Coral for the Gold Cup while Max Dynamite is out to 12-1 (from 8-1) with the same firm. Mehmas, the favourite for the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot as he went into the stalls for the Listed National Stakes, lost his place at the top of the market for next month\u2019s race after suffering the first defeat of his career behind Global Applause. The result was an abrupt reversal of form from Newbury earlier this month, when Mehmas beat Global Applause by nearly four lengths, but that race was over six furlongs and the switch back to five suited Global Applause. So too did his draw, one off the rail, which allowed Ryan Moore to make the running while Frankie Dettori, on Mehmas, was forced to sit and wait before coming around horses to deliver a charge which never seemed likely to carry him past the winner. \u201cWe\u2019re back on track,\u201d Ed Dunlop, Global Applause\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cHe is so big and even Ryan says he\u2019s not a fully mature horse yet. He was much the biggest colt in the race and I hope the fact that he\u2019s now had three races already will stand him in good stead at Ascot. \u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019ll go next and then he\u2019ll have a bit of a holiday.\u201d Richard Hannon, the trainer of Mehmas, also insisted that he was \u201cdelighted\u201d afterwards, and his colt too will now head for the Royal meeting. \u201cHe wants six and he\u2019ll go to the Coventry now and take a bit of beating, I\u2019d say,\u201d Hannon said. \u201cThe experience here will make a man of him. That\u2019s the draw here, sometimes it gets you beat.\u201d",
