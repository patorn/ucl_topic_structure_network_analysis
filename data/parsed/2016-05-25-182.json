  "body": "The Liberal Democrat politician David Rendel, who has died aged 67 after suffering from cancer, achieved the largest majority ever recorded by his party when he won the Newbury byelection in May 1993 by more than 22,055 votes. The Tory defeat in what had been one of the party\u2019s safest seats for nearly a century came as a considerable shock to John Major\u2019s government, and led directly to the defenestration of the then chancellor of the exchequer, Norman Lamont. The party leadership had known the government was unpopular in the wake of the Maastricht treaty negotiations and the humiliating falling out of the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday the previous autumn, but the 29% swing against the Tories in west Berkshire came as a jolt from which Major\u2019s government struggled to recover. It did not win another byelection. Lamont, who had incautiously attempted a joke at a pre-election press conference, complacently echoing Edith Piaf in claiming \u201cJe ne regrette rien\u201d when asked about the government\u2019s economic policy, lost his job within weeks. He had been staying at the family home of his special adviser, David Cameron, for his visit to the constituency. Cameron himself had presciently decided not to stand in the byelection and the Tory candidate was a Somerset farmer named Julian Davidson. By the time he was elected, Rendel had already fought and lost four times at general elections, twice in Fulham, before moving to Newbury and losing twice there, the second a year before the byelection by more than 12,000 votes. A tall, thin, and scholarly figure, he was the antithesis of a populist politician and as an Old Etonian and former Oxford rowing blue he was a distinct throwback to an earlier era in Liberal politics. But his family had deep Liberal roots \u2013 an ancestor had been an associate of Gladstone \u2013 and he had been and remained an astute, campaigning local politician. Rendel was born in Athens, the son of Alexander Rendel, a foreign correspondent for the Times, and his wife, Elizabeth (nee Williams). He was a scholar at Eton, then spent a year as a teacher in Cameroon and Uganda with Voluntary Service Overseas before going on to study physics and philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a member of the university boat race winning crew in 1974. He then worked in the computing and finance departments of Shell, British Gas and Esso. Rendel married Susan Taylor in 1974 and the couple moved to Newbury in 1986 when she became a GP in the town. Within a year he was on the local district council and the Liberal party\u2019s candidate (as part of the SDP-Liberal Alliance) in that year\u2019s general election. He might never have won the constituency at all but for the sudden death following a routine operation in 1993 of Judith Chaplin, a former adviser to Major, who had been parachuted into the safe seat at the general election the previous year. Newbury accordingly became the first byelection after the Black Wednesday debacle and Rendel was able to make full use of his local knowledge as a campaigner and politician of clear integrity. He secured more than 37,000 votes, 65% of the total and more than twice as many as the Tory candidate, helped by the complete collapse of the Labour vote. There were 19 candidates at the byelection (then a record), three of them anti-Maastricht Conservatives, beside the official candidate, as well as Screaming Lord Sutch and \u201cMiss Whiplash\u201d Lindi St Clair, among a host of other fringe exhibitionists. Having grown up locally, I covered the campaign for the Guardian: it was quite a circus. My father, a quiet anti-Tory, told me jubilantly the following day that it was the first time he had ever voted for a winning candidate. In parliament, Rendel cut a slightly diffident figure. He served as the Liberal Democrat spokesman on local government (1993-97) and then higher education (2001-05), opposing student tuition and top-up fees and leading the fight against the Labour government\u2019s plans to scrap single parent benefits and cut those for disabled people. He also served on the public accounts and procedures committees. He came fifth when he stood for the leadership in 1999 after Paddy Ashdown stood down, losing out to Charles Kennedy. He was perhaps too solemn and reserved a figure for the leadership but he fought for the party to retain its distinctiveness, opposing Ashdown\u2019s attempt to draw closer to Labour and, in 2010, as one of the Lib Dems\u2019 federal executive committee, he was the only one to vote against going into coalition with the Tories. Rendel may have lost some support when in the mid-1990s he backed the controversial Newbury bypass project, which was fiercely opposed by environmentalists \u2013 though not by his constituents, tired of traffic congestion in the bottleneck town \u2013 and, conversely, when he voted for the fox hunting ban in 2004, opposing a pastime cherished by some local hunting and racing types in west Berkshire. Rendel held the seat, with decreasing majorities, until the 2005 general election, when the Tories narrowly regained it with a candidate, Richard Benyon, whose family had been local landowners for several centuries. He lost a second time to Benyon, by 12,000 votes, at the 2010 election, and lost even more heavily last year when he stood for the party at Somerton and Frome in Somerset. He had continued to serve on West Berkshire district council after his parliamentary career, retiring in 2015. He is survived by Susan and their three sons. \u2022 David Digby Rendel, politician, born 15 April 1949; died 16 May 2016",
