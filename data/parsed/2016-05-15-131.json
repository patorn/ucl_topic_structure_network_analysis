But Port of Spain\u2019s Queen\u2019s Park Savannah \u2013 a huge park on the world\u2019s largest traffic roundabout \u2013 has another claim to fame: street food. Come dusk, throngs of locals from all walks of life park their souped-up cars in the middle of this giant, grassy plot of land and settle down for an evening of \u201climing\u201d\u2013 that\u2019s chatting, chilling with a Stag beer and munching on Trinidad\u2019s finest cheap cuisine.     Trini treats \u2026 snack stalls in Queen\u2019s Park Savannah during carnival. Photograph: Alamy    There are chicken wings, rum smoothies and battered fish, but one of the most popular dishes is doubles: \u201cThe mischievous little cousin of roti,\u201d Andrew, a local punter, tells me. Order a round of \u201cdoubles with everything, slight\u201d, and two beige pancake-esque circles will arrive \u2013 a chewy, fresh and moreish concoction of lightly fried turmeric- and cumin-infused dough that\u2019s heaped with curried chickpeas, mango chutney, tamarind sauce, cucumber and the \u201cslight\u201d sliver of chilli (though the spicier version won\u2019t blow your head off). It\u2019s here in the Savannah that you can also sample Trinidad\u2019s second-most famous street food: pholourie, a kind of savoury donut. At one of the stalls, a twentysomething woman cranks up her radio\u2019s power ballads and works a saffron-laced batter into golf ball-sized spheres before plopping them, one at a time, into a vat of boiling oil. The balls become crunchy on the outside and squidgy in the middle; a golden-hued snack that\u2019s drenched in a selection of zesty mango, tamarind and lime chutneys.",
