Something along those lines? Dramatic or understated, home or abroad, we want to see your best shot. We\u2019ll choose and publish a selection of our favourites, and the winning image will be mounted and displayed to the public with the other monthly winners in an end-of-year exhibition at the Guardian offices in London. Plus digital printers Point 101 will send you a copy of your winning shot to hang on your own wall. The winner will be entered for the overall prize, a seven-night \u2018Secret Fjords\u2019 self-drive holiday to Iceland for two people, courtesy of Discover the World.
