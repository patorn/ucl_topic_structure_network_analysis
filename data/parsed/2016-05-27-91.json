  "body": "Kenneth Starr, the Baylor University president demoted on Thursday for mishandling reports of sexual assaults by football players, has claimed he knew of no such allegations until last fall, even though at least one case reached court as long ago as 2014. Starr \u2013 best known for his years investigating Bill and Hillary Clinton in the 1990s \u2013 said in a statement released on Thursday that he \u201cagreed in principle\u201d with the university board\u2019s decision to transfer him to the position of chancellor. \u201cI applaud the board for its transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must be known, however, that I was not privy to any of the allegations regarding interpersonal violence until the fall of 2015, at which time I immediately launched an internal investigation.\u201d An investigation by an independent law firm found that leaders of the Baptist university in Waco, Texas, had \u201ccreated a cultural perception that football was above the rules\u201d.  The board released a summary of the report, which said football staff ran \u201cuntrained\u201d investigations and \u201cimproperly discredited\u201d claims. Overall, the report said, administrators showed a \u201cfundamental failure\u201d to investigate claims, and at least once actively discouraged an accuser from making claims. \u201cWe were horrified by the extent of these acts of sexual violence on our campus,\u201d Richard Willis, chairman of Baylor\u2019s Board of Regents, said in a statement. Starr apologized in his statements, saying: \u201cTo those victims who were not treated with the care, concern and support they deserve, I am profoundly sorry.\u201d He will also continue to work at the school as a law school professor. \u201cFor now, I happily remain a part of Baylor Nation,\u201d he said.   Related: Kenneth Starr's job in peril for handling of Baylor University sex assault cases    Starr earned national notoriety during the 1990s, when he spent a long period investigating Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 1994 he was appointed to investigate whether the Clintons broke the law in an insider real estate deal that became known as Whitewater. Several people close to the Clintons were convicted of fraud in related cases, but Starr found no evidence of wrongdoing by the couple. His investigation grew to include the suicide of White House lawyer Vince Foster and, finally, the president\u2019s sexual infidelities. His report described Clinton\u2019s sexual liaisons in graphic detail, and eventually concluded that Clinton had committed perjury during a civil case brought by Paula Jones over sexual harassment \u2013 later settled out of court \u2013 by denying \u201csexual relations\u201d with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was impeached \u2013 the second president to be impeached \u2013 and was acquitted. Last week Starr seemed to express regret about the \u201cunpleasantness\u201d of Clinton\u2019s presidency, and told a panel in Philadelphia that the former president had a \u201credemptive process\u201d after leaving office. Starr returned to private practice and several high-profile cases, including California\u2019s brief ban on same-sex marriages. He also defended billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who eventually was convicted of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. In 2010 he joined the Baptist church and took over as president of Baylor, raising millions for the school in part through an emphasis on the football program. \u201cDespite these dark days,\u201d Starr said on Thursday, \u201cI remain resolved to join hands with the Baylor family to continue to build the university as we carry out its distinct mission in Christian higher education.\u201d On Thursday the board also fired its head football coach, Art Briles, who led the team to a 50-15 record and two Big 12 titles. He was also criticized for recruiting athletes who had been dismissed from other schools for their behavior. One such student, Sam Ukwuachu, was convicted in 2015 of sexually assaulting a female soccer player. In 2014 football player Tevin Elliott was accused by five women, suspended by the football team, and eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison on two counts of sexual assault. At least six women have accused eight Baylor athletes over the last seven years, and the school faces a lawsuit from a woman who says officials acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to rape reports. Briles has not yet commented. His daughter, Staley Lebby, wrote on Facebook that his ousting was a \u201cmedia witch-hunt\u201d and her father a \u201cman of incredible character\u201d. Some current players expressed support for their coach, with linebacker Taylor Young tweeting: \u201cYou don\u2019t turn your back on your leader when things get ugly.\u201d Others expressed gratitude that the coach \u201ctook a chance\u201d and kept faith in them, and at least one athlete, cornerback Ryan Reid, said the scathing report was ultimately good. \u201cThis is going to help a bunch of college[s] in the long run,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta start with us.\u201d \u201cThis is a new era in college football [where] we can see now that no type of violence is acceptable.\u201d",
