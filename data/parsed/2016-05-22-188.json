  "body": "New York looms so large in the collective imagination, the city a permanent set broadcasting images 24/7, that only the work of a rare talent such as Neil Libbert can jolt us into seeing it anew. In a series of street scenes capturing his first impressions of 1960s New York, he shows the city\u2019s swagger, the cocky young lads, glamourpusses and money men, through the eyes of an outsider, a fresh-faced photographer from Salford. \u201cNew York was very exciting. It was a good city,\u201d remembers Libbert. \u201cHarlem probably wasn\u2019t the safest place to be wandering around with a camera, and there were a lot of bricks being thrown around, but I had no problems.\u201d \u201cMany of the photographs appear to have been taken discreetly,\u201d says curator Katy Barron in the introduction to her catalogue for Unseen, a group photography show featuring Libbert\u2019s work, \u201creflecting both his natural reserve and huge charm.\u201d     Lower East Side, 1964 by Neil Libbert.    Above, Libbert, who went on to become a leading photojournalist for this paper, captures a young boy on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side posing for another photographer with a toy gun. We witness both the frenetic energy of the city\u2019s streets, a literal blur of activity visible in the photo\u2019s foreground, and, through its characters and the shop window\u2019s signs, its multiculturalism. Barron has said of Libbert\u2019s images that they \u201cconvey the optimism and energy of a city that considered itself the economic, political and cultural capital of the world. Such confidence was short-lived.\u201d Look closely and the image is full of shadows, while the child in the foreground is oblivious to the gun, albeit a toy one, being brandished behind her back. \u2022 Unseen London, Paris, New York, 1930s-60s: Photographs by Wolfgang Suschitzky, Dorothy Bohm and Neil Libbert is at Ben Uri Gallery, London NW8 until 29 August",
