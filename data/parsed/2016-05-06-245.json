  "body": "They may have been around since the 19th century, but savvy street-facing businesses are still using the humble sandwich board to catch the attention of curious passers-by. From inspirational quotes to dirty limericks, pubs, cafes, restaurants and shops are using humour and the element of surprise to lure punters through the door. And it appears to be working. The Artillery Arms pub in east London, for example, gained exposure in the national press thanks to a sign making light of a burglary at the premises during the night: \u201cThis pub is so good that someone tried to get in eight hours before we open!\u201d  Other businesses have instead courted controversy \u2013 Brick Lane Coffee hit the headlines with its provocative sign reading \u201cSorry no Uggs (slag wellies)\u201d.  Buzzfeed, meanwhile, is brimming with listicles of the funniest chalk boards or signs, while social media sites such as Pinterest and Instagram are also littered with user snaps. Whether it\u2019s a joke that made you laugh, a clever pun or an inspirational poem, we want to see your photos of the best sandwich or chalk boards in your area.
