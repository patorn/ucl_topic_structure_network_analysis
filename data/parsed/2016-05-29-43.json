The 25-year-old finished the two days of competition in Austria with 8,056 points \u2013 an agonising 44 short of the 8,100 required to make it to Rio. The pole vault proved to be the difference as Bryant struggled to clear 4.40m, 30cm below his personal best, because he was using borrowed equipment in heavy rain.

However, when that flight was cancelled the pair took a Swiss Air flight instead, having been assured they could also bring their equipment with them. But despite three days of increasingly desperate phone calls, the poles never turned up in G\u00f6tzis. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the poles are at the moment,\u201d Bryant said, \u201cbut I think not having them was the decisive thing. I know if I had my set of poles the qualifying would be done so it is frustrating \u2013 I needed 4.60m to make it.\u201d Bryant did his utmost in the remaining events, the javelin and 1500m, but fell agonisingly short. \u201cI gave it my all in the 1500m but it was not enough,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is painful to be so close but it\u2019s my first decathlon for two years. I had shoulder surgery last year and I\u2019ve realised I\u2019m in really good shape.\u201d However, a British Athletics spokesman held out the possibility that Bryant could yet make it on to the plane to Rio because of the exceptional circumstances surrounding his case. \u201cWe are aware of the difficulties Ashley has faced and we will look at this as an individual case,\u201d he said. Lane, the other British competitor in G\u00f6tzis, withdrew after the first day having failed to borrow a pole vault of the same size he was used to. He will instead try to make it to Rio at an event in the Czech Republic in a fortnight\u2019s time. Lane\u2019s coach Toni Minichiello, who also looks after Jessica Ennis-Hill, said that bringing poles on planes was a perennial problem. \u201cSome airlines take them, some don\u2019t,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen the flight was cancelled, John spoke to Swiss Air and before he paid anything wanted to make sure that these will get on. They said \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d The poles, however, never made it to Austria. \u201cI think Ashley borrowed a pole off a Swedish guy,\u201d Minichiello added. \u201cHe has a 15ft pole when most use 16ft. I spoke to the Germans about helping John and they said \u2019we don\u2019t use children\u2019s poles\u2019.\u201d Poles differ by length and flex, so they are tailored to an individual\u2019s requirements. As Minichiello explained: \u201cUsually poles are freighted to big championships. But when you are an individual athlete you are on your own recognisance. Even though this is a trial, it\u2019s up to you to get yourself there and your equipment.\u201d That isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. The Irish pole vaulter Kevin Atkinson once put his poles on a plane \u2013 yet when got to the other end they had been sawn in half.",
