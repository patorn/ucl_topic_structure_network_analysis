  "body": "Alastair Cook, speaking after his England side completed a series win against Sri Lanka with a nine-wicket victory at Chester-le-Street, admitted that becoming the youngest cricketer to score 10,000 Test runs had been playing on his mind and his passing of the milestone brought with it a sense of satisfaction.   Related: England win Sri Lanka series after Alastair Cook hits 10,000 Test runs    Nudging the sixth ball of his innings off his legs for four in trademark fashion, as England chased down 79 on the fourth day to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, Cook became only the 12th player to reach the five-figure mark and the youngest to do so \u2013 aged 31 and 157 days. India\u2019s Sachin Tendulkar had held the record, aged 31 and 326 days, though he needed 34 fewer innings than Cook\u2019s 229. It was a moment of relief for the England captain, who became the country\u2019s leading Test run-scorer at Headingley last summer when he went past Graham Gooch\u2019s 8,900 but has suffered the 10,000 mark becoming the latest millstone around his neck this year.       \u201cIt should not play on your mind but it did and I can\u2019t deny that,\u201d said Cook, whose unbeaten 47 also allowed him to pass Michael Atherton\u2019s record of 3,815 runs as England captain. \u201cIt is a special moment for me personally to join the club and the company of the people who have scored 10,000 runs. \u201cThe 10,000 has been a milestone that has driven me over the last few years. You get tested at the top of the order in all conditions against the best bowlers bowling with the new ball and I\u2019m glad I have hung around long enough not to get dropped.\u201d   Related: Typical of the man, Alastair Cook passes Test milestone with minimum of fuss    On winning the series Cook said: \u201cIt has been a good two weeks. To win a game by an innings and then nine wickets is a good effort. It was tough. The pitch died a death and was a bit more like Colombo than the Chester-le-Street we have known in the past. \u201cSri Lanka made us work hard for it and sometimes it is a bit sweeter that way because you feel you have earned it.\u201d Made to work hard they certainly were with Jimmy Anderson, the man of the match, taking five for 58 in Sri Lanka\u2019s second innings following on \u2013 his 21st five-wicket haul in Test cricket \u2013 as the tourists amassed 475 all out, more than their previous three innings combined in an otherwise one-sided series. Anderson\u2019s dismissal of Rangana Herath lbw for 61 after lunch \u2013 the 450th victim for England\u2019s record wicket-taker \u2013 ended a seventh-wicket stand of 116 with Dinesh Chandimal. Chandimal\u2019s defiant 126 allowed Sri Lanka to set England a nominal target and push the day into a third session, having begun it 309 for five and still 88 runs in arrears. \u201cIt is a fantastic achievement and something that has been on his mind for the last few weeks,\u201d Anderson said of Cook\u2019s feat. \u201cWhat an amazing achievement for him. All that hard work, the effort, the lows and highs as well. \u201cIt has all come down to this moment for him. He should treasure it and to be the youngest to 10,000 runs in Test cricket is incredible.\u201d   Related: Alastair Cook's 10 greatest Test innings - in pictures    Angelo Mathews, the Sri Lankan captain, said: \u201cWe talked about the Sri Lankan fight, we\u2019ve lost that in the past couple of weeks but we brought it back in the second innings. Chandimal, Rangana and Kaushal Silva [who made 60] showed a lot of skill and character.\u201d Immediately after the victory England named an unchanged squad for the third Test at Lord\u2019s starting on 9\u00a0June, giving clarity to the players and the batsman Nick Compton in particular. Compton had spoken about his fears over his place but the No3 was 22 not out at the end, crashing the winning runs with successive fours.",
