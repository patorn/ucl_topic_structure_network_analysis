We were on a hill-walking trip and the sense of achievement at scaling those Lake District crags awakened a thirst for adventure. Bullied mercilessly at school, I suffered attacks of anxiety and was reluctant to be away from home. But once the idea struck, there was no stopping me \u2013 having asked where to find the world\u2019s highest peak, it would be only four years until I first set foot on it. During those years, I ran competitively to build up stamina, took up rock climbing, completed the Three Peaks Challenge and ascended Mont Blanc. I began fundraising while doing my A-levels. At 18, I would have been the youngest British climber ever to reach the top of Everest on the south route, but it was not to be. After weeks of trekking, my team arrived at base camp on 19 April 2014, the day after an avalanche killed 16 Sherpa guides. It was, at that time, the worst human tragedy in Everest\u2019s history, and all climbing on the mountain was abandoned for the rest of the season. It would be 12 months until I was able to venture back. An extra year\u2019s training left me feeling much more prepared and I started to feel excited about the prospect of some real climbing. The morning we set out to climb to camp one from base camp was grim, stormy and turbulent. We left at first light, heading up the icefall on the south side of the mountain, laden with rucksacks. We passed towering columns, crumbling ledges and yawning crevasses; but as thick fog obscured the route, I kept my head down, focusing on one step at a time. After several tough hours, I was past the most technical section of the climb, on some big, open ice blocks. I was close to camp one but completely alone \u2013 Tim, the team leader, and Ellis, another climber, were perhaps 20 minutes behind me. Most other members were already at the camp when the earthquake struck. I\u2019ll never forget the cracking noise that echoed through the valley. I looked up, startled, knowing it was ice breaking away from the mountain, but was unable to see more than a few metres ahead. There was nowhere to run; I barely had time to wonder whether I\u2019d be better off unclipping myself from my climbing rope before the avalanche hit me like an express train. It just kept coming, forcing snow into my nose and mouth. Gasping for air, I tried to swim against the white tide. I felt pure fear, a sickening, helpless sensation in my stomach. I knew that vast chunks of ice would be crashing down and had no way of knowing whether I was in their path. I thought of my family back home and imagined the headlines announcing my death \u2013 I had no expectation of surviving. Abruptly, the wind subsided and the mountain fell silent. I\u2019d only been hit by powder snow and had escaped the worst of the avalanche, but knew a further collapse could be on the way. There was no response when I tried to radio ahead and I wondered if everyone above and below me had been swept away: was I the only team member left alive? Crying, I pressed on, eventually reuniting with Tim, Ellis and two more members of the team; alive, but overwhelmed. There were tears when we reached the camp: the rest of the team had assumed we were dead.   Related: Experience: I paid to have my daughter kidnapped     When we radioed base camp, we realised how lucky we\u2019d been. The whole area had been hit by a much bigger avalanche and completely destroyed. It was two days before we could be helicoptered down, and the camp still looked like the site of a plane crash. Twenty-two people had been killed, including three members of our support team. One of the Sherpas who died was just 19, the same age as me. His death affected me badly. On the way home, I broke down, eaten up by survivor\u2019s guilt. Nearly 9,000 people were killed by that earthquake. Since then, I\u2019ve focused on raising funds to help rebuild Nepal. I plan to return to Everest for a third attempt one day. Like the bullying at school, it\u2019s something I need to overcome before I can move on. \u2022 As told to Chris Broughton Do you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian.com",
