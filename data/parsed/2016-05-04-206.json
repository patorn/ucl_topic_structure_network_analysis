  "body": "The election of Donald Trump would derail the landmark agreement on climate change reached in Paris last December, the architect of the accord has warned. Trump is now virtually certain to be the Republican candidate for president and has said \u201cI am not a great believer in manmade climate change\u201d, leading to fears he would attempt to unpick the historic agreement if he became president.  Without naming Trump, the former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius told an audience in London: \u201cThink about the impact of the coming US presidential elections. If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption.\u201d He said: \u201cWe must not think that everything is settled.\u201d In response to a speech by Barack Obama at the opening of the Paris climate summit, Trump said: \u201cI think one of the dumbest statements I\u2019ve ever heard in politics, in the history of politics as I know it, which is pretty good, was Obama\u2019s statement that our No 1 problem is global warming.\u201d Under the Paris agreement, 195 nations have agreed to limit global warming to no more than 2C, with an aspirational limit of 1.5C, in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change. At a ceremony in New York last month, 175 countries formally accepted the Paris accord, bringing it closer to coming into force. The UN is now pressing to begin the implementation of the deal, needing the formal agreement of countries with 55% of global emissions, which will require countries to take action on emissions and to provide financial assistance to the developing world.   Paris climate deal adoption graphic   Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the two remaining Democratic candidates, are both in favour of action on greenhouse gas emissions and support the Paris accord. The US Congress, dominated by Republicans, may also oppose the actions needed on emissions to fulfil US commitments under the Paris agreement, even if a Democrat is elected president in November. However, Fabius noted, the deal was carefully crafted in Paris to ensure that the US president would have the authority to sign up to it. This was the subject of a last-minute hitch in the Paris talks, when as the final draft was published US negotiators balked at the inclusion of a clause saying countries \u201cshall\u201d commit to fulfilling the agreement, instead of the previous wording which was \u201cshould\u201d. If the former had been included, it would have caused legal problems in the US as Congress could have claimed the president had exceeded his authority. However, Fabius insisted the change of wording, subsequently dropped, was a \u201cmistake\u201d rather than a deliberate attempt at sabotage, which has since been the subject of conspiracy theories. He pointed out that all countries, after a short discussion, quickly agreed to the change, and this would not have happened if they had wanted the \u201cshall\u201d to be included. \u201cJohn Kerry came to me and said if it is \u2018shall\u2019 we can\u2019t do it. I came to Christiana Figueres [the UN climate chief] and we came to the previous version and the previous version was \u2018should\u2019,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf it was a mistake in writing, you can change it - if it was a real thing [it would not have been possible]. I said it was really not intentional, it was a mistake. We had three versions of the text. [Shall] was never discussed.\u201d Fabius, who is now president of France\u2019s constitutional council, said he was \u201cd\u00e9sol\u00e9 bien sur\u201d that Laurence Tubiana, France\u2019s chief official at the talks, had not been chosen to succeed Figueres when she steps down in July. That job has gone to Patricia Espinosa, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to Germany and former foreign minister. Fabius said she was \u201cvery competent\u201d. The French government had asked UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon to reopen nominations to consider Tubiana\u2019s candidacy. Countries must press ahead with the implementation of the Paris accord, Fabius added. He warned of \u201crisks associated with reluctant countries\u201d. He refused to be drawn on whether a British exit from the EU would harm progress on climate change, but said that when he was foreign minister he had urged the UK to stay. He met Philip Hammond, UK foreign secretary, on Wednesday but details of what was discussed were not disclosed. He also said he had been concerned over the prospective TTIP agreement when he was in office. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, France\u2019s president, has said he would not accept TTIP in its current form. Fabius was in London to collect the Green Ribbon award in parliament for the best international environmental achievement of 2015. The Guardian also received a Green Ribbon for the best journalism on the environment, in regard to its \u201cexceptional\u201d coverage of the Paris climate talks and the Keep It In The Ground campaign.",
