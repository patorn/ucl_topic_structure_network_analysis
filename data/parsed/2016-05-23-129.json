  "body": "A judge found a Baltimore police officer not guilty on all of the charges against him for his involvement in the death of Freddie Gray. Officer Edward Nero is the first of six officers charged to receive a verdict since Gray\u2019s death sparked uprising in the city more than a year ago. Gray, a 25-year-old African American man, died a week after his arrest from injuries he sustained in police custody, setting off weeks of protest, followed by a riot, a state of emergency and a curfew.  Judge Barry Williams ruled on Monday that Nero was not guilty of assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office, all misdemeanors. Although Nero\u2019s case produced the first verdict, it is prosecutors\u2019 second attempt to hold officers criminally responsible for Gray\u2019s death. The first trial of officer William Porter ended in a mistrial after the jury could not reach a decision. He is slated to be tried again later this year.  Baltimore Bloc, an activist group that was deeply involved in the protests in Baltimore last year, said in a statement that the verdict is \u201cupsetting but not at all surprising to anyone who has been paying attention to police brutality cases all over the country, or to anyone who has been paying attention to [state\u2019s attorney] Marilyn Mosby\u2019s office\u201d. Nero was one of the two officers who arrested Gray. A video recording of the initial encounter with Nero and fellow officer Garrett Miller that went viral after Gray\u2019s death shows Gray screaming with his legs twisted up as he is dragged to the police van.

Photograph: AP    Nero and Miller arrested Gray after Lt Brian Rice claimed that Gray fled upon seeing police and called in a foot chase. Gray\u2019s friend Brandon Ross, who was with him that morning, testified that Gray ran just before seeing the police and was not running from them. When Nero and Miller stopped Gray they still did not know why their lieutenant ordered them to chase Gray. Prosecutors charged Nero with assault based on a novel legal theory that Nero committed a crime when he arrested Gray without meeting the legal standard of probable cause. Because the arrest was illegal, they reasoned, any contact with Gray after that was assaultive. They also argued that even if it was Miller and not Nero who initially detained and arrested Gray that Nero was still responsible as an accomplice. Judge Williams peppered the prosecutors with skeptical questions about this theory during the trial.  \u201cYou\u2019re saying here in this court that if there\u2019s an arrest and there isn\u2019t probable cause, it is a crime?\u201d Williams repeatedly asked prosecutors.  But Miller, who had been forced to testify in the case, said during the trial that it was he, and not Nero, who was primarily responsible for the arrest.  Williams said he rejected the assault charge because he found that Nero was not legally responsible responsible for the initial detention and arrest of Gray.

Legal experts had warned that the case against Nero was weak and ill-conceived.  Warren Brown, a Baltimore lawyer who has been following the case closely, said he was not surprised that Nero was acquitted. He noted that both Miller and Ross were called as witnesses by the prosecution, but their testimony ended up bolstering Nero\u2019s defense.  \u201cTo make a case when there wasn\u2019t a case, Marilyn Mosby\u2019s office decided early on, they were going to charge Nero and Miller. They were the ones on camera, they were the white officers, they were the ones that garnered the most amount of concern in the community. So they had to charge them but I think realistically they never should have been charged,\u201d Brown said, adding that in Nero\u2019s case \u201cwhat you saw in court [was] the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office trying to make something out of nothing.\u201d Nero was also charged with reckless endangerment, for helping load Gray on to the floor of the police van in handcuffs and shackles without hooking his seatbelt. The medical examiner ruled that Gray died due to a catastrophic spinal injury that occurred in the van. Numerous police witnesses testified that it is the van driver\u2019s responsibility to hook the seat belt. Caesar Goodson, who was driving the van in which Gray died, is the next officer to stand trial. Williams ruled that the state had failed to present any evidence showing that a reasonable officer in Nero\u2019s position \u201ccould reasonably presume that another officer, superior or not\u201d would not hook the seatbelt and it would become his responsibility. Though the state argued that failing to follow a police department general order constitutes misconduct in office, Williams seems to have accepted a stricter standard of the law, which requires an element of \u201ccorruption\u201d in order to make such a failure criminal. Todd Oppenheim, a public defender who writes about fourth amendment issues, thinks Williams made the right call. \u201cI would want the same outcome for my clients with the same lack of proof against them,\u201d he said. \u201cWilliams didn\u2019t cave in to public pressure.\u201d Activists said Nero\u2019s acquittal reflects the broader failures of the justice system. \u201cThe type of illegal arrest that led to Freddie Gray\u2019s death is the same type of arrest that leads to Mosby\u2019s office prosecuting people like Freddie Gray every day,\u201d said the statement from Baltimore Bloc. \u201cWe do not expect justice for Freddie or for Baltimore to come from a prosecutor\u2019s office or a courtroom.\u201d Kate Drabinski, a gender and women\u2019s studies professor, tweeted a similar sentiment:     Nero was acquitted bc he was doing what he was supposed to. We have to change what cops are supposed to do. #NeroTrial\u2014 Kate Drabinski (@kdrabinski) May 23, 2016    Lt Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said in a statement: \u201cOfficer Nero is relieved that for him, this nightmare is nearing an end. Being falsely charged with a crime, and being prosecuted for reasons that have nothing to do with justice, is a horror that no person should ever have to endure. Unfortunately, however, his relief is tempered by the fact that five other police officers, outstanding men and women, and good friends, must continue to fight these baseless prosecutions.\u201d  In the next trial that starts on 6 June, Goodson, the driver of the van, faces the much more severe charge of second-degree depraved-heart murder. The trials of the remaining officers will continue into at least October, after a series of appeals over Porter\u2019s mistrial led to delays. While legal experts say Nero\u2019s case may be weaker than those against some of the other officers, Oppenheim warned that \u201cthey all suffer from the difficulties of trying to prove criminal negligence when at least six people are involved in the incident\u201d.",
