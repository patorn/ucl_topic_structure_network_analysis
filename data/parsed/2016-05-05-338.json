  "body": "Gareth\u2019s Invictus Choir 9pm, BBC1 Welcome to peak Gareth Malone. The man can seemingly raise a tune and a tear wherever he goes, and in this two-part documentary he\u2019s on the hunt for wounded ex-servicemen and women willing to perform at the Invictus Games. First stop is a trip to meet Prince Harry, then he\u2019s off to find 12 singers and hear their inspiring backstories as well as their voices. As ever, some can already sing, while others need lessons, but Malone has all the charm and encouragement they need. Hannah Verdier Peaky Blinders 9pm, BBC2 It\u2019s 1924 and Tommy Shelby is finally getting wed \u2013 but not before he plunges yet deeper into trouble with a plot involving a dodgy Russian and Churchill himself. The direction is sumptuous, taking in the stark white of the wedding party kitchens and the warm sepias of the candlelit celebration dinner, but the dialogue remains as clunky as a bucket dropped down a mine shaft. People keep saying how they\u2019re feeling and stating the obvious. Completely maddening. Julia Raeside Grayson Perry: All Man 10pm, Channel 4 The artist takes a tilt at the eternally vexatious question of what it means to be a man. Perry\u2019s pitch is that his penchant for dressing in women\u2019s clothes has lent him an unusual perspective on his gender. We are, he contends, \u201ca stranger, more interesting bunch than we let on\u201d. For the first of three episodes, subtitled Hard Man, he ventures to the least reconstructed reaches of masculinity, spending time with north-eastern cage fighters. Andrew Mueller Election 2016 11.45pm, BBC1 It\u2019s easy to overlook, what with the forthcoming EU referendum dominating the news agenda, but today brings a slew of important polls. As well as elections for the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly, sundry English councils are up for grabs. There are elections for police commissioners and city mayors, too, including Sadiq Khan v Zac Goldsmith in London. Huw Edwards anchors Auntie\u2019s coverage, with assistance from Jeremy Vine, Emily Maitlis and Laura Kuenssberg. Jonathan Wright Kangaroo Dundee and Other Animals: Natural World 8pm, BBC2 As part of the Natural World series, Australian kangaroo whisperer Chris \u201cBrolga\u201d Barnes returns to our screens, following up his appearance on the wildlife strand in 2014, when his tireless work rescuing and raising orphaned kangaroos was first broadcast. He has since expanded his brood to include three camels, a southern hairy-nosed wombat and three emu chicks. As if that isn\u2019t enough work, Barnes is building his own wildlife hospital, too. Ben Arnold Hazen\u2019s Wild Survival Guide 8pm, Nat Geo Wild Having spent much of his previous series proving his ability to survive in some of nature\u2019s least accommodating environments \u2013 from the Sahara desert to the Arctic Circle \u2013 it\u2019s safe to say Hazen Audel knows a thing or two about the wild. In this new series, the former teacher draws upon the accumulated knowledge of indigenous people to survive all manner of punishing situations. First up, it\u2019s the rainforests of the tropics. Mark Gibbings-Jones The Last Alaskans 9pm, Discovery In 1980, the US deemed Alaska\u2019s isolated National Wildlife Refuge unsuitable for settlers. In this remarkable and poignant series, we meet some of those who stuck around, such as the Korths, whose daughter drowned in the river she was named after \u2013 a fact that makes them more attached to the area, they say. There\u2019s also loner Bob Harte, whose wife left him at the refuge and returned to civilisation. Some stories here are hinted at; many more are left unspoken. Ali Catterall TV films The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973), 11pm, TCMIt may look a little creaky now, but this tale of demonic possession was once a contender for scariest movie ever. Friedkin\u2019s combination of grainily authentic photography (reminiscent of his French Connection) and head-swivelling special effects is still unnerving, as Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) and mother Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) battle Beelzebub for the soul of young Regan (Linda Blair). Paul Howlett To The Wonder (Terrence Malick, 2012), 1.30am Friday, Film4After the years of ruminative cinematic exploration in which aeons seemed to separate his films, Malick has picked up the pace, with this arriving just a year after The Tree of Life and another, Knight of Cups, imminent. It\u2019s an enigmatic and at times wondrous study of a seemingly doomed love affair, with Ben Affleck\u2019s engineer falling wildly for Olga Kurylenko\u2019s free-spirited Marina on the Mont Saint-Michel. PH Live sport Cycling: Four Days of Dunkirk, 2.15pm, Eurosport 1The second stage of the race in France, featuring a journey starting and ending in Aniche. IPL cricket: Delhi Daredevils v Rising Pune Supergiants, 3pm, Sky Sports 2Twenty20 action from Raipur. Europa League football: Liverpool v Villarreal, 7.30pm, BT Sport EuropeThe second leg of Liverpool\u2019s semi-final. Can Klopp land a trophy in his first season?",
