It was 21 November 2014, and the professor, Blake Wentworth, walked her to a secluded area of the University of California, Berkeley campus, according to Hemenway. Wentworth, in tears, allegedly confided to Hemenway that other students had complained about his conduct and told the undergraduate senior that if he ever made her uncomfortable, she should not report it because it could cost him his job. Standing with her behind a building, he also referred to Hemenway as a \u201cgorgeous young woman\u201d and said other men in the department thought she was an \u201cobvious target\u201d for sexual harassment and were \u201cjealous that such beautiful young women are always coming and going from my office\u201d, according to a complaint obtained exclusively by the Guardian.   Related: Disturbing details of sexual harassment scandal at UC Berkeley revealed in files    \u201cIt just made my skin crawl ... imagining middle-aged white men talking about how beautiful and tempting I was in an office,\u201d Hemenway recalled in a recent interview. Hemenway, now 24, is the latest woman to take legal action against a powerful male faculty member at the prestigious northern California university, widening a scandal that has roiled the campus over the past year and ignited a national debate about sexism and discrimination in academia.    It just made my skin crawl, imagining middle-aged white men talking about how beautiful and tempting I was in an office  Nicole Hemenway     In her first interview about her case, Hemenway described how Wentworth\u2019s treatment of her and his sexual advances derailed her studies and how the school failed to protect her \u2013 allowing her to sign up for an independent thesis with the professor despite the fact that officials knew of numerous misconduct allegations against him. Hemenway said she felt obligated to speak up in hopes that it would push the University of California to do a better job shielding students from harassers and supporting victims when they come forward.  She knows it\u2019s a gamble. By launching a case and sharing her experience, she said, she may jeopardize her future graduate school and career prospects since Wentworth is well-known in the field of south Asian studies. And even if the professor is found to have harassed Hemenway, it\u2019s unclear if he will be punished. The university concluded Wentworth harassed another student last October, but eight months later, he has faced no discipline. Remaining silent out of fear Hemenway\u2019s complaint with the California department of fair employment and housing, along with extensive emails shared with the Guardian, paint a picture of a professor who frequently behaved inappropriately and unprofessionally with a student he was advising \u2013 escalating to sexual advances that made it very challenging for her to finish school. Wentworth\u2019s alleged misconduct resembles the behavior two graduate students described in recent formal complaints against him in which the women said he repeatedly made offensive sexual comments and inappropriately touched them.

Although 11 of them resigned or were terminated, no faculty members were fired \u2013 including Wentworth, a tenure-track assistant professor in the department of south and south-east Asian studies. The school also determined that a famous UC Berkeley astronomer and the dean of the elite law school harassed subordinates but they faced minimal consequences. In the wake of accusations that the school systematically refuses to hold harassers accountable, UC Berkeley provost Claude Steele resigned, later admitting that he had regrets about the light punishment the law dean faced. Hemenway\u2019s difficulties started in fall 2014 after Wentworth agreed to be her honors thesis adviser. Immediately, the professor began initiating very personal conversations with her, including discussions of sexual harassment accusations he was facing from others, according to the complaint.

The professor also forwarded Hemenway extensive email conversations he had with others about the harassment claims against him \u2013 correspondences in which he and others mocked the allegations. In one message, Wentworth wrote, \u201cI want to find out who\u2019s spreading this rumor, and grind their fucking nuts into powder before I distribute it into communal meals for his family.\u201d He also repeatedly referred to Hemenway as \u201cattractive\u201d and a \u201cshining star\u201d in the emails, while calling another undergraduate an \u201cugly girl\u201d. Hemenway said she tried to brush aside his behavior, but it only got worse. She wanted to speak up but was worried about her career. Because Wentworth was advising her on her thesis and responsible for her letters of recommendation, she felt she had to remain silent.

According to the complaint, the professor repeatedly called her \u201choney\u201d and \u201choney bear\u201d and put his hands on hers while complimenting her and staring intensely into her eyes. He also allegedly suggested that he wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with her as soon as she graduated.  \u201cI will always honor professor-student boundaries,\u201d he said, according to the complaint. \u201cOnce you graduate, that\u2019s an entirely different scenario. I look forward to the day when you graduate. \u2026 But until then, just know that I will never come onto you or make you feel uncomfortable. Got that, honey?\u201d    He got plenty of warnings. My harassment never should\u2019ve happened if Berkeley was doing its job  Nicole Hemenway     Wentworth had also repeatedly promised to leverage his connections in the field and help her get into graduate programs. She feared that if she rejected his advances, she would lose opportunities \u2013 and that if she raised concerns about harassment, he would be enraged. She had read his angry rants about other accusations and had once seen him throw a chair when he was angry, according to the complaint. Hemenway strongly considered skipping her commencement ceremony altogether so she wouldn\u2019t have to see him. \u201cI would\u2019ve done anything to not go to graduation,\u201d she said.  She ultimately decided to attend so she could give a commencement speech but hopped on a flight immediately afterward in an effort to avoid Wentworth\u2019s invitation to a \u201cdinner date\u201d, according to the complaint. Wentworth declined to comment on a detailed list of Hemenway\u2019s accusations. His attorney Michael Hoffman also declined to respond to the claims, saying: \u201cDr Wentworth denies the allegations, and we\u2019re going to address the matter in the proper forum.\u201d   Related: UC Berkeley students to file state sexual harassment complaint against professor    Hemenway said she decided to file a case this month in part to support the two women who went public with their experiences \u2013 graduate students who could still run into Wentworth at any moment on campus, despite the fact that the university found last fall that an allegation against him was credible. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know how much they\u2019re sacrificing, but they\u2019re still willing to take that risk for the greater good so more women don\u2019t have to experience this,\u201d Hemenway said. She said she was also driven to expose how the university fails to take allegations seriously and act on complaints. \u201cHe got plenty of warnings,\u201d she said. \u201cMy harassment never should\u2019ve happened if Berkeley was doing its job \u2026 His rights have taken precedence over our rights.\u201d According to a letter multiple faculty members signed, at least seven students have given testimonials expressing concerns about Wentworth. \u2018I\u2019m in limbo\u2019 Officials at UC Berkeley and across the public university system in California have pledged to improve its policies and procedures for investigating sexual harassment. In April, UC president Janet Napolitano announced a series of reform efforts aimed at increasing accountability of investigations, improving the reporting process for victims, developing sanctions that match the seriousness of substantiated complaints, and ensuring that processes are completely in a timely manner. Despite those pledges, Wentworth\u2019s case has dragged on with no clear explanation.     The school also determined that a famous UC Berkeley astronomer and the dean of the elite law school harassed subordinates were also found guilty of harassment but they faced minimal consequences. Photograph: Geri Lavrov/Getty Images    UC Berkeley spokeswoman Claire Holmes declined to comment on Hemenway\u2019s complaint or Wentworth\u2019s employment status, but said in an email, \u201cThe university is aware of the concerns from students and others regarding the time it takes for the faculty discipline processes to be completed. We understand and share those concerns.\u201d Erin Bennett, one of the grad students who filed a complaint last month, said that because Wentworth\u2019s punishment was still pending, she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll be able to return to campus in the fall. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in limbo,\u201d she said. Hemenway said it\u2019s a very real possibility that she will no longer be able to pursue south Asian studies. \u201cI understand so well now what barriers to entry in a male-dominated field means and how difficult it is to cross those barriers. The system isn\u2019t made for me.\u201d",
