  "body": "Paul \u201cFatty\u201d Vautin is as dyed-in-the-wool a son of Queensland as the XXXX Man in Milton, the big bull in Rockhampton, the giant gumboot of tropical Tully. But the 22-game Queensland State of Origin man has some advice for the New South Wales Blues. And it is this: adapt or perish. Again. \u201cIf you\u2019re going in with the same team that last year got beaten 52-6, you\u2019re kidding yourself,\u201d Vautin tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIf NSW don\u2019t change up their side they\u2019ll get beaten again.\u201d   Related: Josh Reynolds stakes State of Origin claim in Bulldogs' win over Roosters    Granted, Vautin would not be the first person Laurie Daley turns to when casting about for advice on his best XVII. But Vautin isn\u2019t just a head-wobbling gag-man on The Footy Show. He knows the game, knows a footy player. He rings blokes today, offers advice. Blokes take it. They thank him. And in terms of who should don a blue jumper, his advice to NSW selectors is to pick men with speed, skill and fear-factor.  \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about Origin: when you run out onto the field, you\u2019re looking across at the players you don\u2019t want to play against. For me I\u2019d look at Peter Sterling, and think, \u2018Shit he\u2019s good, so strong, hate playing against Sterlo\u2019. Paul Sironen? \u2018Great player, Sirro, but I feel I can handle him\u2019.   \u201cIf I\u2019m a Queenslander, I want to see NSW pick the incumbents. I don\u2019t want to play against Blake Austin because he\u2019s different, good speed, runs for himself. I don\u2019t want to play against Bryce Cartwright \u2013 skilful, tough, that offload.  \u201cMate, when you\u2019ve won one series in 10 years, why wouldn\u2019t you change it up?\u201d  Why not indeed, Fat Man. Why not indeed. And it seems that following the weekend\u2019s round 11 action that Daley and NSW selectors will unleash some crackerjack colts alongside the tried-and-tested. And as Fatty says, why wouldn\u2019t you? Why not pick blokes who\u2019d frighten the Canetoads? Who\u2019d be a good chance of, you know, scoring more points? (Made easier if you don\u2019t let Queensland score 52.)   And so here we are, and with just the Eels and Storm to round out NRL round 11, the NSW Origin brains trust has leaked like a sieve and the team announcement will contain some surprises but no surprises. And we can safely say that the following Origin arguments have been settled (well, as much Origin arguments can be) after the weekend\u2019s big match action. Mitchell Pearce v Adam Reynolds Pearce could play and could perform well. He\u2019s slick, he\u2019s polished. He\u2019ll kick long and chase. He\u2019ll bomb. He\u2019ll play a quality if generic halfback\u2019s game of footy and when he\u2019s in your red zone he\u2019ll feed the speed men wide. But he wouldn\u2019t worry Queensland. Because you know what you\u2019re going to get. The Maroons know Pearce. They can defend Pearce. And on top of his well-documented spell in purgatory and ongoing issues \u2013 and stated desire that he doesn\u2019t want to play \u2013 then Blues fans will welcome a new halfback, Rabbitohs man Reynolds. Nippy, chunky, high-skill off the boot, Reynolds will cause angst for the Queensland forwards with his sharp darts off the mark and precision kicking. They\u2019ll fancy running big men at him but that\u2019s how it rolls for halves who don\u2019t give change from 85 kilograms. But his numbers are the best of all NRL No7\u2019s this year. He had a top game Thursday night. And he\u2019s due. It\u2019s his time. The No6 The Blues toss five-eighths like bad poker hands. The list of pivots since 2010 reads: Jamie Lyon, Trent Barrett, Jamie Soward, Todd Carney, James Maloney, Josh Reynolds, Mitchell Pearce. This year it\u2019s Maloney again, probably, despite Josh Reynolds having a blinder against the Roosters Sunday, and showing off all his skill and nark, and very real human desire. He was five-eighth the last time NSW won and Daley often talks of loyalty to incumbents, which makes it surprising Reynolds was dropped. Following the Fat Man Method, Daley should\u2019ve picked Blake Austin in the No6, he frightened the poor hopeless Warriors Sunday more than The Amityville Horror. But Maloney is a big reason for the Sharks\u2019 eight straight wins and premiership ascension. I like Austin. And Fatty likes Austin. But neither of us selects five-eighths for NSW Blues and tells their mates. The Gallen question There\u2019s a clutch of props Daley could slot in who\u2019d do a job in the hard-charging-no-passing department. David Klemmer, Paul Gallen, Aaron Woods, Andrew Fifita, James Tamou. Ryan James and Aiden Tolman were part of the 2016 Emerging Blues, while Reagan Campbell-Gillard belted many men in City-Country. I like that kid, he\u2019s good. But Daley will likely start with Woods and Gallen, and start two of Tamou, Fifita and Klemmer from the pine. And they will do a good job and cart it up hard like angry automatons, and look to score the fantasy football numbers of Gallen who always makes many metres. But Gal? Well. I dunno. I like him. He\u2019s perhaps the gnarliest, hardest chunk of granite bopping about today. But when Peter Sterling \u2013 a legend of the game, for sure, but in terms of who\u2019ll be picked for NSW little more than a red-head-wobbler or Guardian gibber merchant \u2013 suggested Gallen wasn\u2019t in his NSW Origin team, Gallen tossed toys out the cot. Got the hump. But why would he care what Sterlo thinks? Is he that insecure? And if so why? The rest Robbie Farah is fit and will be the No9 because Daley is loyal except when he isn\u2019t, and for all Mick Ennis\u2019s good form and hustle-bustle, he isn\u2019t frightening. Josh Mansour will be on a wing and Blake Ferguson, they say, on the other one because Will Hopoate is on a prayer not a wing due to him not playing footy on Sundays and it\u2019s hard to pick a player on not playing footy form. Josh Dugan runs like a hairy goat and you\u2019ve got to have him in somewhere, which means right centre because Matt Moylan\u2019s a gun and you just want him in there, at fullback. He\u2019s a beauty, Moylan, the next Darren Lockyer. I\u2019d have had Jarrod Croker at left centre because he\u2019s a super defender, runner and support man, and he could kick goals from Caxton Street, an important quality in tight action. You and Fatty might plump for James Roberts. But word is \u201cJet Shoes\u201d Micky Jennings is the man to stop Greg Inglis from ripping off his crackerjack goanna action. Elsewhere Bryce Cartwright has the Fat Man\u2019s X-factor (but didn\u2019t get a gig), Josh Jackson has run and grunt (and did), and Boyd Cordner is back like he never went away. Trent Merrin and Wade Graham would have given the Blues plenty but will watch from wherever. Good mail says Dylan Walker has a seat on the bench after running hard in the centres against Cronulla and not setting Brookvale alight at five-eighth. Jack Bird\u2019s been good all year and plays centre and five-eighth. Which seems odd. Queensland Queensland? Oh, you mean the other team contesting this annual interstate series? The champion team of their generation? Perhaps the best team ever? Answer this: Does it even matter whom they fit around Inglis and their spine of Darius Boyd, Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk and Cameron Smith? As long as they\u2019re big and hard and don\u2019t drop the ball, and wrestle for Albania \u2013 hello Corey Parker, Matt Gillett, Sam Thaiday, Matt Scott, Josh McGuire, Jacob Lillyman \u2013 then the wizards and Michael Morgan will do their thing, and all wingers have to do is catch, leap and slam. Better players, better team, better culture. Will win.",
