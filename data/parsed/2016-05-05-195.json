  "body": "Divergent author Veronica Roth\u2019s new book is due to be released 17 January 2017 and it\u2019s one of the most closely guarded secrets of the YA world. But we\u2019ve got a sneak preview!  Check out the atmospheric cover and read a short extract from the book here. Plus, don\u2019t forget to scroll all the way to the bottom for the chance to ask Veronica your questions! Carve the Mark is the title, and that\u2019s pretty much all we know at this stage. It will be the first in a duology and Roth has said previously that it is a sci-fi fantasy set against a backdrop of political turmoil, telling the story of a boy named Akos who is kidnapped with his brother. To save his brother\u2019s life, Akos must try to form an unlikely alliance with the dictator\u2019s sister, Cyra, and dangerous mayhem \u2013 we are assured \u2013 will ensue. So now we have new clues! That title \u2013 wow, cryptic \u2013 and the tagline on the cover: \u201cHonour has no place in survival\u201d\u2026 And is that lava or liquid gold we see oozing from the cracks\u2026?
