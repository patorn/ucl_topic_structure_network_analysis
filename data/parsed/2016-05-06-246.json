  "body": "Many British voters believe EU membership has no impact on public services, according to a new poll.  The poll of 1,002 British adults, commissioned by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting (Cipfa) and conducted by ComRes, found that 40% of respondents believed that being in the EU is detrimental to the delivery of public services, while 78% said that UK membership puts pressure on public services. But a high proportion of respondents said it would make no difference to health and social care (46%), the quality of higher education (60%) and regional economic development (40%) whether Britain voted to leave or to remain. This is in stark contrast to the views of staff working in health and social care, local government, higher education and elsewhere in the public sector, according to Cipfa\u2019s new report named Treuble and strife, on the impact of EU membership on UK public services. The report is based on 20 in-depth, anonymised interviews with public sector leaders, 19 of whom said that public services would be better off if the UK voted to stay in the EU.    Decoupling the British state from the EU will cause tremendous upheaval for public services for many years  Rob Whiteman, Cipfa     UK and EU legislation, policy and economic activity is intertwined, leaving a complicated picture. One leader from the higher education sector is quoted in the report: \u201cBecause Britain has been a part of the EU for 40 years it\u2019s pretty complex to work out what are the influences separate from everything else. It\u2019s difficult to work out what\u2019s EU-related and what\u2019s UK government-related.\u201d Eurosceptics argue that the EU\u2019s free movement policy places a financial strain on public services, that EU regulations create unnecessary costs, and that the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU budget \u2013 a net amount of \u00a35.7bn in 2014 (pdf) \u2013 could be spent on public services instead. EU benefits But according to the Cipfa report, the public sector has benefitted from access to a wider pool of skills and talent because of the free movement of workers within the EU. It states that 10% of NHS health and social care professionals (pdf) are from countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), while around 15% of academic staff in UK universities are from the EU (pdf).  European legislation is credited with improving working conditions, and EU structural funds have helped create more than 50,000 jobs in poorer regions of the UK. The report also argues that the UK balance sheet relies heavily on economic stability, so a vote to leave could see a downturn in public spending. \u201cIf we had an exit and it had a severe negative impact on the British economy then you would expect that it would filter down through austerity measures to local government,\u201d said one survey respondent. There is also a risk that the value of public sector pensions would decrease following a vote to leave the EU. Health There\u2019s a fear among staff interviewed by Cipfa that a leave vote could lead to staff shortages in the health sector. In social care, for example, migrant workers are more willing to work the unsocial hours required to provide 24/7 care, Oxford University research suggests. One health professional quoted in the report said: \u201cThe ability for the travel of the labour across into our country is critical and they add a significant added value to the expertise, not just at a clinical level but across the pool.\u201d Cipfa\u2019s report suggests that EU formal and informal networks have had a positive impact, allowing staff to learn from other countries and work together on key health issues such as obesity. The EU working time directive, which regulates work time and rest periods, has had a significant impact on the health sector workforce \u2013 though it has been criticised for leading to reduced hours and inflexibility. Local government   Related: \u2018We want our country back\u2019: a visit to the most Eurosceptic and Europhile places in the UK    Local government leaders in many of the UK\u2019s biggest cities have defended the influence the EU has on local services, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Havering council becoming the first to vote to leave the European Union, in January this year. Many in the sector are worried about the impact of having to accommodate more migrants, and some believe that EU migration is part of the problem. Some are also annoyed that local government is subject to EU procurement rules, which ensure free access on competition across member states, meaning that UK suppliers do not get priority for UK tenders. But, according to the report, others argue that EU membership cultivates growth \u2013 the UK will receive \u00a35.3bn in structural funds for 2014-2020 \u2013 which in turn encourages devolution. Environmental targets are often set at EU level and carried out by local government, and local areas have seen the benefits of policies on pollution, clean beaches and protected nature zones. A complex picture Rob Whiteman, chief executive of Cipfa, said: \u201cJobs, healthcare, defence and all the issues we care about rely on public services that are deeply interlinked with EU membership. This message has not got through strongly enough.  \u201cOur research shows an extremely complex picture. Overall, in the research amongst public service leaders, respondents considered the benefits of EU membership outweigh the drawbacks. What is abundantly clear, is that decoupling the British state from the EU will cause tremendous upheaval for public services for many years.\u201d The report concludes that it is crucial people are provided with detailed and balanced information. \u201cIt is of the utmost importance then that the voters get to hear better informed arguments that clearly demonstrate and consider the impact the EU has on public services rather than emotionally driven arguments that would seem to be founded on, often, false perceptions rather than reality,\u201d it said.
