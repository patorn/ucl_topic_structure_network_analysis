  "body": "London-based fashion designer Jonathan Saunders is to become chief creative officer at New York label Diane von Furstenberg. The announcement comes five months after the Scottish designer closed the eponymous label he set up in 2003, citing personal reasons. The appointment, which is effective immediately, makes creative sense. Both the designer and the label champion colour and print and have an aesthetic that speaks directly to grownup women with cash, and sometimes curves. Von Furstenberg, who remains as chair of the brand, was effusive in a statement released on Monday: \u201cJonathan\u2019s extraordinary passion for colours and prints, his effortless designs and his desire to make women feel beautiful make him the perfect creative force to lead DVF into the future.\u201d She went on to say: \u201cI could not have found a cooler, more intelligent designer.\u201d Saunders, meanwhile, said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d, and noted that \u201cthe spirit with which this brand was founded is incredibly relevant today\u201d.

Photograph: JP Yim/Getty Images    In recent years, critics of the DVF brand have not been entirely in agreement with Saunders\u2019 assessment of the brand\u2019s relevance. The label\u2019s catwalk collections have occasionally championed exuberance above a fresh contribution to the fashion conversation. Moreover, having the inimitable Von Furstenberg as the figurehead of the brand could be a hindrance as well as an asset: her Studio 54 wrap-dress vibes provide powerful, and sometimes insurmountable, iconography. At her last show in New York, the designer opened up her Manhattan apartment and hosted a fashion \u201cexperience\u201d where social-media supermodels danced around in vignettes wearing sequinned wrap dresses. It evoked the lifestyle that the designer is known for, but perhaps missed the mark in terms of trends.     Diane von Furstenberg in New York, 2011.

The challenge for Saunders will be to harness this commercially compelling and laudable narrative at DVF, while re-engaging the label with more timely catwalk preoccupations. Perhaps a little more wonk, a little less wrap dress among the vibrant prints.",
