  "body": "Shall we have an athleisure recap? Right, so here\u2019s an omnibus edition of what you may have missed. I\u00a0won\u2019t bore you with the fastest-growing-retail-sector stuff. What you\u00a0need to know is that (a) the sweatshirt is the new crewneck; (b)\u00a0tracksuit bottoms are now several rungs higher on the fashion pecking order than jeans; and (c), Olympics or no Olympics, it\u2019s a safe bet that whoever is declared overall winner of 2016 will be wearing a tracksuit, probably the sold-out deconstructed one by Parisian label Vetements. Where do polo shirts fit into this? The polo shirt is the athleisure update on the T-shirt, in the same way that the sweatshirt is the new crewneck. The tone of fashion is shifting from that architectural-minimalist, \u201cI probably work in an art gallery\u201d look to something both sportier and a bit more brassy. Looks that would have been a bit naff \u2013 a\u00a0bit Westfield, if you know what I\u00a0mean \u2013 are now deeply fashionable. Tracksuits, say. And polo shirts. Today, I am also wearing fashion\u2019s other big deal right now: the midi-length skirt. It\u2019s a strange disconnect of the current scene that there are loads of desirable mid-length skirts out there, but not many top-half options that work with them. A plain crewneck T-shirt tucked into a calf-length skirt sounds a good idea, but ends up looking too slumpy \u2013 on me, anyway. I have seen other people in a long skirt with a snazzy bomber, but when I tried the combo it looked as if I\u2019d panic-bought an Amazon dressing-up costume (Cool Fashion Blogger Shoreditch \u2013 Adult Size). A\u00a0polo shirt, however, has just enough structure and just enough fashion. (Stella McCartney\u2019s SS16 show put simple, block-coloured polo shirts with matching skirts.) There is something brilliantly direct about a polo shirt \u2013 see Vicky McClure as Lol in This Is England 90 \u2013 that offsets fashion-y pieces such as my JW Anderson ruffled skirt here.

Sorry to be blunt: it\u2019s the polo shirt talking. \u2022 Jess wears polo shirt, \u00a370, fredperry.com. Skirt, \u00a3365, by JW Anderson, from harveynichols.com. Platforms, \u00a3139, senso.com.
