  "body": "Oregon standoff leader Ammon Bundy was a peaceful protester advocating the constitutional beliefs of US supreme court justices Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia, according to the jailed activist\u2019s formal defense filed on Monday. Bundy\u2019s motion to dismiss the federal charges that he led a violent conspiracy against the government with an armed occupation of a wildlife refuge lays the groundwork for a trial that could have a lasting impact on the controversial land-use movement in the west. On 2 January, Bundy, 40, led a group of activists into the Malheur national wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon to protest the federal government\u2019s treatment of local ranchers. The protesters, some of whom were heavily armed, took over a number of public buildings at the refuge headquarters, launching a standoff with federal authorities that dragged on for 41 days. Bundy and two-dozen other activists were eventually arrested and now face serious felony charges for using \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cthreats\u201d to impede the government, which could lead some of them to spend decades behind bars.   Related: Ammon Bundy offered to plead guilty if Oregon protesters' charges dropped    \u201cContrasted with shallow and uninformed media portrayals and government hyperbole, Ammon is not an \u2018extremist\u2019 and is not a member of any militia, patriot group, or political land protest organization,\u201d Bundy\u2019s attorneys wrote in the filing. \u201cMr Bundy is not a ... so-called \u2018sovereign citizen,\u2019 and he does not hold anti-government views.\u201d The new motion claims that Bundy identifies as a \u201cfederalist\u201d and an \u201coriginalist\u201d, meaning he believes the federal government has overstepped its authority by owning vast swaths of land in the west and has strayed beyond its limited jurisdiction the founders intended. \u201cThis is hardly a philosophy of extremism or violence, and has been championed on both sides of today\u2019s dominant political spectrum,\u201d Bundy\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cOriginalism is a constitutional approach and philosophy with its most well-known adherents being current United States supreme court justice Clarence Thomas [and] the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\u201d  The filing also references Hugo Black, a liberal supreme court justice who also espoused originalist beliefs. Bundy and his followers have long argued that the federal government does not have the authority to own and regulate the Malheur refuge, which is a federally protected bird sanctuary that the US Fish and Wildlife Service oversees.  The philosophy has spread among ranchers and activists in the west in recent years, propelled forward by Ammon\u2019s father, Cliven Bundy, a Nevada rancher who received national attention for refusing to acknowledge federal authority on public lands by his ranch, culminating in a tense standoff in 2014. Although constitutional experts, bolstered by a number of court decisions, have repeatedly refuted the Bundys\u2019 claims and affirmed the government\u2019s land-use authority, Ammon\u2019s lawyers say the supreme court should specifically address \u201cwhether Congress can forever retain the majority of the land within a State\u201d. The federal government owns 53% of the land in Oregon. The motion also notes that, over the last year, lawmakers in Utah have considered filing an expensive lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of federal land ownership.

A spokesperson for the US district attorney\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
