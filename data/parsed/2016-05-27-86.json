  "body": "Has the status of the EHIC, the European health insurance card, been raised in the EU referendum debate? What will be the consequences for this if the vote is for Brexit \u2013 and how will it affect travellers and expats living in the EU?Hazel FarrallKing\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk \u2022 The extension to Tate Modern is another example of the trend to build atriums to nowhere (First look: inside the Switch House, 23 May). Such buildings welcome you into large airy spaces, usually with grand staircases and often with coffee bars and places to sit. But the bigger, significant spaces that you would expect these foyers to lead on to are not there. They are an end in themselves, and they are for people to wander up and down as on a boulevard. The Tate has clearly accepted what art galleries are really all about.John LinfootBournemouth \u2022 As author of the Ladybird book How it Works: Shopping on the Internet, can I say that it was not a parody as suggested by Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris (Letters, 23 May)? The book was an actual Ladybird book.Chas BayfieldLondon \u2022 Sorry to be a spoilsport (Letters, 26 May), but my two computers updated to Windows 10 flawlessly and continue to work perfectly well.Derek HaseldenRoss-on-Wye, Herefordshire \u2022 I hope Nottinghamshire county cricket club are prepared for dressing-room mutinies this season \u2013 both Fletcher and Christian are currently in the first XI.Michael CunninghamWolverhampton \u2022 Keen readers of the Arthur Ransome\u2019s works will be wondering what will, in subsequent films, happen to Dorothea\u2019s brother (Titty\u2019s family furious over Tatty treatment, 25 May). Will he be rather formally referred to as \u201cRichard\u201d throughout or renamed \u201cDack\u201d?Hilary BlackRoyston, Hertfordshire \u2022 Strange that the film-makers object to Titty, but not to Roger.Roger WilsonBillingshurst, West Sussex \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
