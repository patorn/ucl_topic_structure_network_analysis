  "body": "If you live in one of London\u2019s hipper areas or commute into its centre, you may have been approached this morning at the tube station by a young person in a blue T-shirt handing out yet another free magazine. Aimed at the almost mythical millennial the media is obsessed with, Swipe magazine aims to stand out from Time Out or Shortlistby offering \u201cthe best of the internet in print\u201d. The premise makes sense, on paper at least. People like reading print, but there\u2019s loads of good stuff on the internet. So much in fact, that it\u2019s hard to keep track of it all and find the best bits. Swipe\u2019s editors say they will sift through that morass of content, decide which bits its target audience will like, then shove it in their face on their commute.          Swipe magazine: the best of the internet in print      Related: 'Make Google and Facebook pay levy to support journalism' - academic    They are paying a not exactly generous 10p per word to writers, but the 70-odd contributing sites get promotion for their work.  It has an initial distribution of 20,000 copies, 17,000 by hand and the rest placed in coffee shops and other millennial-friendly hubs. Publisher Tom Rendell insists that outside a media bubble of super-engaged web users, there is demand for a print roundup that filters social media.  \u201cThe internet is 4.5bn pages,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely dominated by huge sites high in Google search rankings. We\u2019re not picking the most popular or the weirdest \u2013 we are looking at this with a journalistic background and thinking how we can give the best experience.\u201d That experience is a mixed bag of articles. A beautifully illustrated cover story on the \u201cdangerous bromance\u201d between Trump and Putin from startup site the Malcontent (run by a former Telegraph journalist) that makes good use of graffiti depicting the odd couple kissing. News stories from Business Insider and its tech offshoot, a long read from \u201cdeep web\u201d publisher Vocativ and, and weirdly, a Wikihow article about how to have a wolf as a pet. The ads are also revealing. A big sponsored content opener from Uber on the inside page, another sponsored article about a \u201cdeveloper bootcamp\u201d and on the back page, a mail order craft beer brewery. Ticking off each entry in the millennial lifestyle checklist. It\u2019s all prefaced with a \u201cTrending\u201d section covering social media such as the Phil from EastEnders meme making the rounds (Utter Philth), a reference to the Chewbacca mask video, and a roundup of Instagram and Twitter posts of the week.  Some of the choices, however, suggest the publishers are aiming for the slightly older end of their millennial target market. News that a sequel to 1999 rave film Human Traffic is on the cards won\u2019t mean much to anyone under 30. And the \u201cTwitter of the week\u201d section includes an (admittedly hilarious) tweet from 2013. This clearly isn\u2019t a magazine for the web-obsessed, head-in-their-smartphone twentysomething.    .@parisreview So is Paris any good or not\u2014 Patricia Lockwood (@TriciaLockwood) January 9, 2013    And that may be the point. There are plenty of outlets that curate the best of the web online, and most of those who are swimming through the internet\u2019s eddies regularly will almost certainly have already identified their favourite ones, or just use their social media feeds to find what will interest them. One colleague at the upper range of the millennial demographic put it, \u201cIt\u2019s like an in-flight magazine for the internet\u201d. Another at the other end of the age range said: \u201clike anyone picking it up being I LIKE THIS, might, you know, go on the internet\u201d. But then for those for whom the more distant reaches of the web beyond Facebook and Twitter (Tumblr anyone?) are more like a foreign country, Swipe can offer a way to ensure they aren\u2019t completely out of touch with the kids.",
