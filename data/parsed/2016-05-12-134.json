  "body": "Roger Federer says he will not be at the French Open if the unspecified injury to his back does not improve sufficiently over the next 10 days for him to play with full freedom and, if he does start in Paris, he reckons his chances of doing well are \u201cnot great\u201d. So, we are a just little closer to knowing where the game\u2019s greatest player stands at 34 as he starts to creak around the edges. The finish line remains a blur but is not so distant as it was even a few months ago. We will know soon enough if Federer can keep his phenomenal 65-tournament run in slams going at Roland Garros, and he did his best in defeat in the third round of the Italian Open to blow the clouds away, if not with any great conviction.   Related: Roger Federer a doubt for French Open after losing to Dominic Thiem in Rome    Federer\u2019s high-end sponsors would be disappointed if he pulls out of the French Open, and his millions of disciples would be devastated. But the man himself will make a decision stripped of commercial obligations and sentiment. He cannot afford to make a fool of himself in public after 18 years of mostly controlled excellence. His health and what remains of his aura come first. Perhaps that is why a disturbing mix of hope, doubt and mutual impatience filled the room when he looked out on a sea of faces who most probably resembled pall bearers rather than hacks on deadline. He knew we wanted a story and he knew we knew what the best headline would be. He wasn\u2019t going to make it easy for us. There were the expected articulate and measured replies, the set-up shots before the occasional cross-table winner, as he explained away his 7-6, 6-4 loss to the rising young Austrian Dominic Thiem and set out how, despite nursing a back problem and seriously lacking match practice, he may yet be practising at Roland Garros next week. Federer, who came desperately close to pulling out of this Italian Open minutes before his match against Alexander Zverev in the second round on Wednesday, said he felt \u201cabout the same [as] yesterday, not worse\u201d. Losing to Thiem did not worry him, he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how I played. Important is that I didn\u2019t have any setbacks. I have only played five matches in the last four months, so clearly I don\u2019t want to get overly excited about what\u2019s ahead. \u201cI thought I could really do a good result in Paris. Now the last couple of weeks [after pulling out in Madrid and losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarter-finals in Monte Carlo], it\u2019s been more difficult. I see my chances as not great. But, if maybe in three, four days I can practice 100% ... then I believe that something is possible again. \u201cClearly the way I\u2019m playing right now is never going to be enough for any good run in Paris; I also wouldn\u2019t play this way. I\u2019m still confident I will be fine somehow. \u201cThis was an information tournament for me. Never a result tournament. I knew I wasn\u2019t good enough for any result here, so that\u2019s why I hope you don\u2019t read into it so much \u2013 and I don\u2019t. I need to see this completely in isolation, and I cannot carry any luggage from here other than the positive information. It just needs to stay here, the results, what I couldn\u2019t do and how limited I was. I was far off. \u201cIf I can play 100% again and move again correctly, my mind\u2019s in a good place. My game is there. I\u2019m still almost beating Thiem, and beating Zverev with whatever I have. I\u2019m surprising myself.\u201d Now there are practical matters to attend to. \u201cDo we stay in Rome, do we go to Paris, do we go back to Switzerland? Those are three options there. Should I rest, should I train, what can I do with physiotherapy? I\u2019m so happy that I didn\u2019t get hurt again this week, that it was worth it that I played. I never had better clay-court preparation, to be honest. Conditions were perfect. I practised on centre court every day for about two hours a day.\u201d But the interrogation was becoming a chore: \u201cIn a way, I still enjoyed myself today, because I just said: \u2018Who cares what I do at 30-all? Who cares what happens, really?\u2019\u201d Then he grew impatient. \u201cYou\u2019re still, to some extent, disappointed, but OK, two minutes, and then get rid of the press, get rid of the doping test, and then I can\u2019t wait to have the meeting with the team and start relaxing and preparing for what\u2019s to come.\u201d Pressed about the nature of his back problem, Federer looked for the exit. He took a bead on the questioner and left with a sharp parting shot: \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into specifics, honestly. I\u2019m not in the mood for you guys to start debating about it because you don\u2019t know, and I won\u2019t tell you everything, anyway. But it\u2019s definitely got something to do with the back.\u201d All we can be certain of is Federer is not at all certain if he will play in Paris and, if he does, he has no idea how well or poorly he will play. It is an unusual scenario for all of us, and a profound one for the game.",
