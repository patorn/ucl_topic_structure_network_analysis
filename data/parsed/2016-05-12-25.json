  "body": "Harriet Harman has claimed campaigners calling for Britain to leave the EU are more likely to associate with an old-fashioned view that a woman\u2019s primary role is in the home. The Labour MP made the claim in an interview with the Guardian in which she also argued that Brexit could derail the fight for women\u2019s rights. Harman, who has been a leading campaigner on gender equality for four decades, said she would not trust high-profile out campaigners such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove or Nigel Farage \u201cas far as I can throw them\u201d on the issue. In response to Harman\u2019s comments, Vote Leave\u2019s Suzanne Evans said it was \u201cutterly laughable\u201d to suggest that \u201cwe need a bunch of former communist men in the EU commission to fight for women\u2019s rights\u201d.   Related: Vote Leave may sideline Nigel Farage, but it can\u2019t live without him | Rafael Behr    But Harman said four decades of campaigning for equality had proven to her that \u201cEU muscle\u201d had been the key to forcing through a series of reforms, including on equal pay, maternity rights and paternity leave, in the face of constant opposition in Britain.  \u201cWhen we put forward these demands they said that they were women whinging, that it was a burden on business, that women wanted special treatment,\u201d Harman said, speaking in advance of a speech on the issue on Friday.  \u201cTime off to go to an antenatal appointment was treated as if women were going off to get their nails done. We were totally opposed, totally patronised, totally condescended and actually vilified, really.\u201d She described how she was branded \u201cHarriet Harperson\u201d and \u201chapless Harriet\u201d while arguing for basic changes that are now considered the norm, such as men getting time off when their babies are born. \u201cThey characterised the demands as unreasonable and hysterical,\u201d she added, urging voters not to forget that \u201ctoday\u2019s unreasonable demands are tomorrow\u2019s conventional wisdom\u201d.  She said the EU had been a \u201cstrong friend to women in this country\u201d, and warned against assuming that Britain did not need that friend because \u201call the men are now modernised and somehow liberated\u201d.  \u201cWe are not stupid,\u201d said Harman. \u201cWe are not in a state of nirvana on women\u2019s rights at any stretch of the imagination. With women it is two steps forward, one step back. We have to be careful this isn\u2019t a major step back.\u201d Harman argued that lurking behind the opposition was the idea that women should not be demanding rights in the workplace when they should really be at home. \u201cWe still see occasionally the veil slips,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd actually there is quite a good match between the people who want to leave the EU and the people who actually want women to be back in the home. Why would we want them to be in charge of our rights? Why would we trust our rights to them?\u201d Harman pointed to Farage\u2019s claim that working mothers were \u201cworth less\u201d to employers after time out, and to a call by the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, founded by Vote Leave\u2019s CEO, Matthew Elliott, to cut childcare benefits by 80%. Evans strongly criticised Harman\u2019s comments, arguing that the Labour politician was labelling British MPs as incompetent. She said it was not true that out campaigners held old-fashioned views. \u201cIt is utter nonsense \u2013 she is playing the man and not the ball. I\u2019ve never been the kind of woman who wants to stay at home,\u201d said Evans, who also argued that Harman was failing to speak for women who chose to give up work. \u201cIs she saying if Labour came into power they would kick out the rights? If you want to be dictated to by an unelected foreign elite, vote to remain. If you want freedom, democracy and accountability via the ballot box, vote out. In picking on one tiny aspect of EU legislation when they make 3,500 every year, she is scaremongering.\u201d   Related: Harriet Harman\u2019s victory was putting women\u2019s lives at the heart of politics | Polly Toynbee    Harman said there were concrete examples of where the EU had driven forward women\u2019s rights. \u201cIt is a paradox. The EU is as every bit woefully male-dominated as our own politics here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Europe was an incredible strength to our elbow, because someone was agreeing with us. Because we couldn\u2019t just be brushed aside.\u201d It was the European project that demanded female cleaners working for British councils had to be paid as well as male binmen, who had much better rates negotiated by their union, according to Harman. To demonstrate how much things had changed, she described one male MP using a point of order during a committee meeting to announce the arrival of his new baby. \u201cAnd I thought: why are you here?\u201d Harman acknowledged that people didn\u2019t like \u201cdirectives from abroad\u201d, but said that when those directives protected women at work, she supported them. \u201cIt is like all-women shortlists \u2013 no one likes excluding men from selection. But if the choice is that 90% of MPs are men or we have shortlists? Let\u2019s go for all-women shortlists. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d",
