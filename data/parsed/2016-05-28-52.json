Brexit explained: young people   Eavis and his festival have been the subject of concern from some political quarters \u2013 notably former Labour leader Neil Kinnock \u2013 because the gates for Glastonbury open the day before the referendum on Thursday 23 June, with music under way on the Friday morning. Lord Kinnock, who became a European commissioner and was vice-president of the European commission until 2004, said it would be a shame if young people were \u201crocking instead of voting\u201d. The festival was arranged for its usual weekend, close to the summer solstice, long before the referendum date was chosen. \u201cIt has been like that for 47 years,\u201d said Eavis. \u201cEven Neil Kinnock should know that.\u201d He added: \u201cThe people coming to our festival have to make sure they vote. The result of this referendum strongly affects their future \u2013 it\u2019s so important for them and they\u2019ve got to ensure they\u2019re part of it. I do believe that the kids who come here will want to be involved. We have said it until we\u2019re blue in the face: if you come, vote.\u201d Eavis knows which box he would like voters to put their mark in. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we vote to remain in the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to get out there, get stuck into this, and vote to stay part of Europe.\u201d There will not be a polling station at the festival, so Eavis and the festival organisers are strongly encouraging ticket holders to vote by post or by proxy if they plan to leave home before polling stations open. \u201cThe show doesn\u2019t start until Friday morning, so most people, coming after work on Thursday, have got a day,\u201d said Eavis. \u201cMany of the people travelling here on Thursday to catch the opening will have time to vote earlier in the day. But those coming from farther away will have to make other arrangements \u2013 and they need make sure to get their postal vote organised.\u201d     Michael Eavis, the Glastonbury festival organiser, believes young people should vote to stay in Europe. Photograph: David Levene for the Observer    As with every other year in the weeks before the festival, fences go up, stages are built and Worthy Farm\u2019s rolling meadows become fields of scaffolding, cranes and bustle. And when it comes to voting in or out, Eavis has also addressed the matter of the \u201cthousands of people who are already here getting the whole thing together\u201d. In Goose Hall, the pre-festival catering site for staff and crew, Eavis has set up an information desk to help people already on site to register for a postal vote \u2013 the deadline is 3 June \u2013 and get their votes into the mail. If they fail to do this, however, there is still hope. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to organise buses to ship [those] people from here to the polls on referendum day, if they\u2019re registered within reasonable reach of the site,\u201d said Eavis. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re going to look at more closely. We\u2019re going to do all we can to accommodate people needing assistance to vote.\u201d Eavis, the son of a Methodist minister, grew up on Worthy Farm. He was inspired to launch Glastonbury after going to the Bath music festival in 1970, where the line-up included Jefferson Airplane, the Byrds and Led Zeppelin. His first \u201cGlastonbury Fair\u201d brought David Bowie, Traffic, Hawkwind and other artists to the farm. Since then, Eavis has become a national institution \u2013 and a local one. He is at ease in the town of Glastonbury, four miles from his Worthy Farm at Pilton, often calling at Knight\u2019s Fish and Chips restaurant \u2013 regularly voted \u201cbest in the west\u201d \u2013 opposite the festival office, for a chat with townsfolk and music fans.   Related: Jeremy Corbyn officially confirmed for Glastonbury    Speaking of his own position on the referendum, and glad to urge his festival fans to agree with him, Eavis said: \u201cI\u2019m deeply for \u2018In Europe\u2019. In with both feet. It\u2019s not for my sake \u2013 I\u2019ve nearly finished; I\u2019ve been on the go at this for 50 years \u2013 it\u2019s for them. \u201cI think most people who come to our festival are reasonably intelligent. And as such, they must realise that our future must be part of this European ideal. \u201cI can understand the OAP \u2013 with a little house in Margate and a picture of the Queen on the mantelpiece \u2013 wanting to be little England again. I accept all that. But it\u2019s the past: that\u2019s just rainy old windswept Margate talking. This referendum is about the future, in which we have to be part of the bigger picture, a continent of opportunities, languages, colours, excitements and exchanges.\u201d With direct regard to the job he does for the rest of the year, Eavis added: \u201cI also need to vote for Europe as a farmer. Farming would be dead in the water if we left the EU. We\u2019d be flooded even more with rock-bottom cheap stuff from Singapore and all over. For farming, this is a serious moment. \u201cAnd my God, I need the Poles I have working here,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are about six of them, and they\u2019re fantastic. Up when we have to be at half-past three in the morning, on time, no problems, no fagging out in the barn. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without them. No \u2013 we\u2019ve got to vote, and we\u2019ve got to stay in.\u201d",
