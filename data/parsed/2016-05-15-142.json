  "body": "Jacques Herzog, the more talkative half of the pair of boyhood friends who founded the architectural practice Herzog & De Meuron, is worried about the world. \u201cThe things based on the five senses that we like so much, all these values \u2013 that we treat people well. They are in danger. There is such a threat around.\u201d He is talking firstly about the threat to European urban civilisation from terrorism, followed some paces behind by his perception that \u201cthe middle class is disappearing\u201d. He sees the loss of possibilities of common ground, of cultural experiences shared by different people. In which case Tate Modern, the vastly successful museum in Bankside, south London, might be considered a redoubt of this endangered world. In 1995, to some bafflement among commentators, Herzog and Pierre de Meuron were appointed architects for what is now called Tate Modern. Who were they? Until that time their best-known works had been signal boxes and facilities for the herbal sweet manufacturer Ricola. Why had this Swiss practice been chosen ahead of Britain\u2019s glittering array of hi-tech modernists, who had been frustrated for years by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s lack of interest in public commissions and Prince Charles\u2019s hostility to contemporary architecture? Tate had already been criticised for its decision to retain and convert grubby old Bankside power station for use as its new gallery of modern art, rather than commission a sparkling new statement of confidence in the future. It looked like architectural conservation gone mad. Feelings were compounded still further by the fact that, of all the entrants in the competition, Herzog and De Meuron proposed to do the least. Their rather modest drawings seemed to show an art gallery that still looked very much like the power station. It was only when Tate Modern opened, in 2000, that the drama and potential of its enlarged Turbine Hall became apparent.    There should be no safety rails in your architectural perception. You should be able to fall down    Now they are back, with the opening next month of their extension to Tate Modern, one of an elite band of globally renowned Pritzker-prize-approved practices and of an even smaller subsection of that band who retain the ability to surprise with their work, who seem still able to invent rather than recycle their greatest hits. Their sweet factories and signal boxes have been augmented by the Beijing Olympic Stadium, towers and museums across the world, wineries and villas, Prada stores, pharmaceutical headquarters, several more stadia \u2013 including one proposed for Chelsea Football Club \u2013 a car park, apartment blocks. Their global/local geographic range includes Vancouver, S\u00e3o Paulo, Tokyo, Kolkata, Mexico, Miami, San Francisco, Tenerife, Minneapolis, Beirut, as well as 60 or more projects in and around their home town of Basel. They employ 422 people at the last count. They have remained throughout in the same tranquil Rhine-side base, centred on an old grey bourgeois villa, but infiltrating and adopting surrounding buildings to form a village of studios and courtyards. At the centre are the two founding partners, whose fellowship has lasted for most of their 66-year lives. In some architectural partnerships there is a division of roles \u2013 one the artist, the other the businessman for example \u2013 but they have always insisted that theirs is an indistinguishable collaboration. They have complementary personalities, however. Herzog, shaven-headed, gym-toned, eloquent, alert with contained energy, is happy to be the public face of the practice. De Meuron has a more professorial manner and stays more in the background. As it happens illness prevents him from meeting me in Basel, so I have to catch up by phone. They are not in the business of false modesty, especially Herzog. Last year they opened a new building to house an archive of decades of creativity \u2013 models, test samples, full-scale mock-ups of bits of building and the like, which thanks to their interest in exploring building materials is a vast magpie\u2019s nest of things shiny, matt, bubbling, melting, perforated, sliced, assembled and moulded, chemical and natural, coloured and monochrome. It is at some risk of resembling a pharaoh\u2019s tomb, but effort has gone into making it a working tool, a place where employees and others can learn how past projects were put together. The archive building, which is surmounted by several floors of flats, is an intriguing, partly menacing structure in an industrial area of Basel. \u201cIt is a great building,\u201d says Herzog.     An artist\u2019s representation of the Tate Modern extension. Photograph: \u00a9 Hayes Davidson and Herzog & de Meuron    Their Tate extension, which is partly a new building and partly the adaptation of previously inaccessible parts of the old power station, enlarges the already-not-small institution\u2019s floor area by 60%. At \u00a3260m and nine years in the making, it will have cost more in time, money and agony than the first version. If they cause bafflement now it will be for a new reason: if in the proto-Blair era they were considered minimal, rarely straying from straight lines and right angles, their new work \u2013 to be known as the Switch House after the former electrical facility it partly occupies \u2013 includes a brooding pyramidal tower, a 64.5 metre-high stack of bricks, faceted and oblique-angled, that is anything but reticent. \u201cIt looks like a car park,\u201d says a friend to me. It certainly goes against all the conventions of public cultural institutions, that they should look open, accessible, transparent and friendly. But then Herzog and De Meuron don\u2019t want just to be nice. Herzog says that they dislike \u201carchitecture that is totally affirmative \u2013 that says this is how the world is and we stay here for ever. Everyone wants solid ground under their feet but the important question is, how do you do all this and at the same time communicate transformation and doubt?\u201d Their work is not just sunny and optimistic. They can also do decadent, crepuscular, uncanny, deliquescent, louche, lubricious. Herzog has said that \u201cthe greatest inspiration is the existing world in all its ugliness and normality\u201d. \u201cThe two of us from the beginning,\u201d says De Meuron, \u201cwe were very interested in everything, not just canonic architecture from Egyptians up to modern times. Everything is interesting if you are ready and able to look at it. There should be no safety rails in your architectural perception. You should be able to fall down.\u201d Artists, says Herzog, are much better at uncertainty and instability than architects. He unexpectedly cites Leonardo da Vinci and the way he painted an angel\u2019s wings: \u201cYou can see he was not a believer. When he paints the joint where the wings meet, when he has to work out how you attach a wing, you get a sense of his disgust and disbelief.\u201d Great names of architecture, by contrast, seem to have no such doubt. \u201cThey were almost religious about their work, a bit absurd. Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier: how can they be such heroes?\u201d Sympathy and collaboration with artists is a distinctive feature of Herzog and De Meuron\u2019s architecture. They started out in the 1970s, an arid time for their profession, and instead found inspiration in working on an art project with Joseph Beuys when they were still students. Later they would work on the Beijing stadium with Ai Weiwei, whom they got to know before he became a worldwide celebrity. All arts, says Herzog, share the questions of \u201chow things are made and why things are made. How organic substance goes with nonorganic. They reveal ways of looking at the world, what comes out when someone does a poem, a painting, a sculpture or a building.\u201d From contemporary art they learned that concept is more important than style \u2013 unlike other architects, Herzog and De Meuron avoid a signature look and instead seek almost obsessively to find a different set of materials, details and forms for almost every project. At the same time each, thanks to a consistent underlying attitude, is somehow recognisably theirs.    \u2018I don\u2019t want to sound arrogant,\u2019 says Herzog, \u2018but the Turbine Hall was a stroke of genius\u2019    They also learned to engage people in different ways, by combining the intellectual with the sensual: they like to build with substances that are delectable, perturbing, earthy, ethereal but in all cases fascinating and engaging. Their means include mud, black lava-like concrete, the multiple reflections of glass, copper, the printing of images on to glass, plastic or concrete such that a wall suddenly resembles the page of a book. They like to give their materials a perceptual twist, such as making the heavy look light or the transparent solid. There is a corresponding range in their projects: they can do a soothing wooden rehabilitation centre for people whose lives have been ripped up by spinal injuries, or the restoration as an arts centre of the sybaritic militia headquarters at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, where sons of the gilded age used to party between going out to subjugate insurrections of the starving. Their affinity with artists helped them to win their first Tate commission, along with a refined gallery that they had by then realised in Munich. They have continued to design spaces for art ever since, such as the recent extension of the Unterlinden Museum in Colmar, Alsace, which houses Gr\u00fcnewald\u2019s Isenheim altarpiece, the hallucinatory masterpiece of agony and exaltation that is one of the greatest works of Germanic renaissance art. Herzog and De Meuron\u2019s design combines subtle insertions with spooky-gothic facades and stairs of baroque dynamism, and exhibits their ability to bring architectural personality to gallery spaces, while also respecting the exhibits. Meanwhile their expansion and success has introduced them to bigger and sometimes cruder commissions. Their chaste early work has, to the dismay of purists, been augmented by spectacle, glitter, going on bling \u2013 the media-friendly Beijing stadium, for example, which imprinted itself on the consciousness of the world. In Basel they have created a long hangar, silvery, scaly and punctuated with a giant circle in the roof, to house the city\u2019s trade fairs. Working at scale puts them in the not-always-nice environments where power and money reside. Their Blavatnik School of Government in Oxford is a wondrous hatchery for future world leaders, but is also an oligarch-sponsored influence machine, a henhouse, as the New Yorker noted, sponsored by the fox. Like Norman Foster, Rem Koolhaas, the late Zaha Hadid or most architects of their stature, some of their commissions expose them to accusations of complicity with tyranny. The involvement of such a well-known dissident as Ai Weiwei in the stadium (though he later regretted it) was some inoculation against criticism, but the project was still clearly central to the propaganda of the People\u2019s Republic of China.

Photograph: Brian Harris/Rex/Shutterstock    No one has found the perfect answer to these questions, nor the right position between virginity and whoredom. Neither perfect purity \u2013 never engage with any government or institution that is any way questionable \u2013 nor complete complicity \u2013 work with absolutely anyone no matter what \u2013 makes sense. Most such architects argue that western governments and businesses work with nasty regimes, so it would be futile for architects to do otherwise, and that engaging with them might do more to change such societies than standing aloof. \u201cThese are good questions,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answers because nobody does.\u201d Herzog and De Meuron are not shy of projects controversial for their scale and impact. In Paris they are designing the Tour Triangle, an 180 metre-high hotel and office building on the edge of the Boulevard P\u00e9ripherique, that was first rejected and then, after some pushing and manoeuvring by mayor Anne Hidalgo, approved by city councillors. In Basel a 41-storey tower for the pharmaceutical company Roche, white and stepped, now rises above the predominantly low-lying and historic city. A second, slightly shorter tower is on the way. In both Paris and Basel their towers have a Shard-like potential to change the perception and scale of their respective cities, for better or for worse. Herzog is keen to argue that the Basel towers differ from the speculative and attention-seeking Shard, in that it grows out of the needs of Roche, which employs a lot of people in the city, for that much space on that site, not that they were \u201cfighting for visibility\u201d. The Paris project is the first skyscraper in Paris since the still-reviled Tour Montparnasse of 1973, but in Herzog\u2019s view is justified by its location away from the centre. It is part of an emerging policy to put towers at the edge of the city, \u201cwhich I totally support\u201d.   Related: London: the city that ate itself    Tate Modern brings together Herzog and De Meuron\u2019s interests in both art and the brute forces of modern cities. \u201cIn Paris,\u201d he says, \u201crigid control makes it so beautiful. London is the greatest city in the world, or at least in Europe, because it gives so much freedom to make money, to do deals. I guess you cannot do both things. The bad thing is that it is more of a struggle [to realise projects like Tate]. The good thing is that there is a network of the most powerful collectors and sponsors. They are great. There are also all these gangsters. That\u2019s London\u201d. The \u201cfight in London\u201d is \u201cmore an individual fight\u201d, in which cultural institutions and their architects have to carve out their physical niche amid the competing claims of property speculation. In this context Tate, and its director Nicholas Serota, constitute \u201ca world wonder. It made itself a space. That is Nick\u2019s great merit. He is the most powerful man in the art world and also the most gifted one. He made it a bastion of publicly accessible space.\u201d The first version of Tate Modern derives its power from the grand declaration of publicness that is the Turbine Hall. The already huge space in which electricity was generated was made still bigger by removing its ground floor and incorporating its former basement into the single void. It was an act of surreptitious extravagance in the architects\u2019 low-key approach that was incomprehensible to the property developers advising Tate. Why would you want to give away all that useful space in the ex-basement? De Meuron says that the hall was \u201cnot in the brief, there was no requirement to have it, but it was given by the building. It created a wholly new way of showing art.\u201d A series of large-scale installations, such as Olafur Eliasson\u2019s artificial sun and Carsten H\u00f6ller\u2019s helter-skelters, made the hall into a new gathering place for London, Britain and indeed the world. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound arrogant,\u201d says Herzog, who is not usually much troubled about giving such an impression, \u201cbut that was a stroke of genius.\u201d In the new, updated Tate Modern, the main move is what De Meuron calls \u201cthe vertical boulevard\u201d, a deliberately oversized staircase that winds its way up the inside of the brick tower. It connects to new art galleries carved out of the parts of the old power station that were still functioning electrical facilities in 2000, and to new spaces for education and other forms of public engagement, a restaurant and a viewing gallery at the top. A high-level bridge connects back, across the Turbine Hall, to the galleries of the first phase, in order to create new ways of moving round the museum. This is a response to prodigious popularity \u2013 currently 5.7 million a year compared with the 2.5 million hoped for before it opened in 2000 \u2013 and it changes the balance of the whole complex. It will now be approachable from several directions, each offering a different experience. In its scale and multiplicity it will begin to resemble a city more than a building, although its monumental shape will still be well defined.

Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images    \u201cHigh attendance is fantastic for a museum but not always for you as a visitor,\u201d says De Meuron. \u201cSometimes you need to be more quiet and peaceful. You need different experiences and different speeds, a variety of activity.\u201d He therefore promises \u201cdifferent spatial constellations. The stairs are wider than we need them; we want to invite people to have a different kind of experience than to rush from one gallery to another. I am curious to see how people walk about it.\u201d Whereas the older galleries are arranged in classical enfilades, one room leading to another, the new ones will include dead ends and spaces standing alone, which are likely to encourage more random patterns of exploration, and unpredictable combinations of eddies and stillness. All of which will be represented on the outside by the aforementioned brick tower, unquestionably fortress-like, which is Tate and its architects\u2019 response to the property free-for-all which, riding on the success of Tate Modern, has caused an anarchy of apartment and office buildings to rise on its doorstep. The brick pyramid is the museum\u2019s bid to assert its presence \u2013 we had \u201cliterally to fight to get some space for the needs of Tate\u201d \u2013 and its material is intended both to cohere with the old power station and assert its difference. As Herzog explains, piling some refined Swiss biscuits on the table in front of him to illustrate his point, an earlier design envisaged stacked-up glass cubes, but the material was too similar to the developers\u2019 stuff. \u201cWe realised that in order to survive we have to strengthen it,\u201d he says. A paradoxical effect is that the private apartments of Neo Bankside, the development by Rogers Stirk Harbour just across the street, are perfectly visible through their glass walls, whereas the public world of the vertical boulevard is only hinted at behind its brick veil. Yet the precedent of the original Tate Modern \u2013 also severe on the outside, lively inside \u2013 shows that a building doesn\u2019t have to gurn and wheedle to be popular. In this and other works, Herzog and De Meuron like to present a protestant moment of denial before pleasure, to forbid before welcoming, to be severe before generous. It is part of their worldview, different from most architects\u2019, in which delight and beauty co-exist with more troubling or mysterious aspects of existence. In this, Herzog believes, architecture can \u201cplay a very good role\u201d in challenging another threat to culture, which he calls \u201cthe negative side of the digital world\u201d. Building is \u201cvery archaic still, and we\u2019ve gone back to more archaic stuff \u2013 gravity, smell, finding roots, not giving pictures, fake images or illusions that you can get on the internet\u201d. It is all part, in their view, of defending and nourishing what is good about civilisation. The new Tate Modern opens 17 June",
