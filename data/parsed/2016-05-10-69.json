  "body": "Even a \u201csmall crisis\u201d could trigger a chain of events that would threaten the stability of the European Union, the credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s has said. Brexit \u2013 if the UK votes to leave the 28-nation union \u2013 or even Grexit \u2013 the departure of Greece from the eurozone \u2013 are the obvious vulnerabilities. But some commentators believe an altogether quieter crisis should also be at the top of the worry list: Italy\u2019s battle to prop up its debt-laden banks.  The country that probably gave the English-speaking world the word for bank \u2013 medieval Italian merchants traded with each other on a bench known as banca \u2013 has a \u20ac360bn (\u00a3280bn) problem in its fragmented banking sector. That sum is the amount of non-performing loans (NPLs) \u2013 loans on which customers\u2019 repayments have fallen behind \u2013 being nursed by Italian banks. Eight years on from the start of the global financial crisis, when the UK\u2019s banking meltdown was marked by the queues of panicking customers outside branches of the now defunct Northern Rock, Italy is facing decisions that \u201cwill shape not just the future of the Italian banking system but that of the European one as well\u201d, according to analysts at the Hamburg-based bank Berenberg.  Banks across Europe have had a tough 2016. Shunned by investors, an index of shares for 600 European banks is down 22% so far. But Italy\u2019s bank stock index is down 35%, with its biggest bank, Unicredit, having dropped 40%. For inspiration, Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minster, has turned to Greek mythology. A \u20ac4.25bn fund set up as a backstop for the banking sector derives its name, Atlante, from Atlas, the god condemned to hold up the sky.  The name alone indicates the herculean task it faces. Italy has more than 500 banks, and more branches than restaurants dotted across the eurozone\u2019s third biggest economy. These heavy cost bases are hanging over them at a time when revenues are under intense pressure from the interest rate policy of the European Central Bank,  which last month cut rates to zero.  The troubled loans amount to 18% of all lending, three times the EU average. Unlike the crisis which hit banks hard in Spain and Ireland, this situation has not arisen from a frenzy of lending to fuel a property boom before the 2008 bust, but through years of failing to tackle poor lending decisions worsened by a weak economy.  In waiting so long to tackle the matter, Italy has found it hard to copy Spain, which in 2012 created a \u201cbad bank\u201d, largely to house those troubled property loans. The EU has changed the rules on state aid since then.  \u201cThe Italian government has been severely constrained in its ability to emulate the Spanish example, due to high public debt and the new, more stringent EU state-aid rules, whereby NPL purchases by a public entity would trigger an onerous \u2018bail-in\u2019 of bank creditors,\u201d said Federico Santi, an analyst at the risk consultancy Eurasia Group. Those new EU rules require bondholders \u2013 and, crucially, savers \u2013 to take 8% of the liabilities before any government funds can be used to prop up banks in a bail-in, the aim of which is to prevent a bailout by taxpayers. Forcing savers to take losses is unpalatable. Cyprus took that route three years ago, hitting savers with more than the \u20ac100,000 guaranteed by EU rules. Just before Christmas, and before the EU rule change, Italy took steps to avoid depositors having to take losses in four lenders: Banca Etruria, Banca Marche, CariFerrara and CariChieti. But some bondholders were forced to take losses, sparking a furious reaction as the bonds issued by Italian banks are often bought by their retail customers. Renzi was accused of overseeing a \u201cstate suicide\u201d when a retired man who lost \u20ac110,000 in Banca Etrutia bonds killed himself. Renzi has adopted a three-pronged approach: the Atlante backup fund, which is also intended to be able to buy bad debts; a plan to allow banks to package up NPLs into bonds with a government guarantee to try to attract buyers \u2013 a sort of bad bank; and a move to speed up the time it takes to repossess properties, which can currently take up to 15 years. Atlante\u2019s first test came last week, when it was forced to shoulder a heavier burden than expected by taking control of Popolare di Vicenza, Italy\u2019s eighth largest lender. Vicenza\u2019s \u20ac1.5bn fundraising was shunned by investors and Atlante\u2019s involvement meant Unicredit was not forced to pick up the bill on its own.  Unicredit, which reported its results on Tuesday, had been expected to guarantee the cash call. \u201cHad this fund not been in place, there would have been quite a tricky situation,\u201d said Filippo Alloatti, a senior credit analyst at the fund manager Hermes. \u201cThe bank which had originally underwritten it, it would have had to consolidate Vicenza \u2026 or even worse, we would have had to have bail-in.\u201d Unicredit, which put \u20ac800m into Atlante, attempted to reassure investors as it reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter, pointing to an improvement in bad debt provisions in the period: \u20ac755m compared with \u20ac980m a year earlier.  The bank\u2019s chief executive, Federico Ghizzoni, heralded a fifth consecutive quarter of falling bad debts. Ghizzoni, who, according to the Financial Times, is under pressure from shareholders, is also closing branches and cutting jobs, more than 3,000 of the latter have gone since last year. On Tuesday he was upbeat, telling analysts: \u201cI believe the government reforms \u2026 will altogether contribute to further improvement in the NPLs.\u201d  One of the next tests is a \u20ac1bn cash call by Veneto Banca. This is being underwritten by a group of banks led by Intesa Sanpaolo. Veneto will begin testing investor appetite for its shares next week, according to reports, and its chairman, Pierluigi Bolla, will be hoping that Atlante is not required to act as a backstop. The outcome will be scrutinised by bank bosses across Italy.",
