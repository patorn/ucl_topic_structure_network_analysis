York handicaps are among the most reliably competitive species of races we have in this country and you also have to worry about the fact that, for whatever reason, some horses just can\u2019t cope with the place. It is the Cheltenham of Flat racing, in that you can always forgive a horse for a poor run there and be interested next time if he runs elsewhere.   Related: Horse racing tips: Wednesday 11 May    I think I shall pass on the Group races on the Knavesmire today. So Mi Dar is the most likely Musidora winner but I\u2019m not tempted by odds of 4-5. Twilight Son is more appealing in the Duke Of York, given that he should still be improving and is a bigger price than Magical Memory, despite having beaten him three times. But Henry Candy gives a pretty strong suggestion in this morning\u2019s paper that his horse is fat and in need of a run. No such problem will afflict Hit The Jackpot (2.10), who was having his second run of the year when scoring at Doncaster last time. He\u2019s only 3lb higher here and, with David O\u2019Meara\u2019s string now in fine form, I feel like sticking with him. The first half of the season has tended to be the time to catch this horse in recent years. He will not appeal to everyone, however, because Hit The Jackpot is one of the more dramatic drifters of the day, from an initial 8-1 out to 20-1 now. Perhaps there\u2019s a reason for that that will result in a poor effort here but it doesn\u2019t put me off. This horse should not be that price, as far as I can tell. Hoof It (2.40) is 12-1 for the following sprint handicap, which he won five years ago from a 6lb higher mark. He lost his form quite badly in the years that followed but recovered to some extent last year, when a Doncaster win was among several good efforts. He\u2019s just 2lb higher here than for that September success and ran a good prep-race on unsuitably soft going at Doncaster last month. Mick Easterby has had a productive spring and this veteran of his is really interesting here. Later, Chief Whip (4.20) has been well supported for the seven-furlong handicap, from 15-2 to 11-2. This well-bred, Coolmore-owned Richard Hannon horse was a taking winner of a Sandown maiden on his only run last year and showed promise when third on his reappearance last month. Judging by the achievements of some of his siblings, there is great potential for him to be well handicapped and he is still entered in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. Tipping competition, day three Our winners so far: Monday Bayan Kasirga 11-1 Wordismybond 5-1 Quick N Quirky 9-2 Tuesday Sir Dylan 7-2 Livella Fella 12-1 Lady Bayside 8-1 And our leader is: BearRides +21.50 \u2026 who had Livella Fella AND Lady Bayside in addition to Quick N Quirky, which is a fairly amazing start to any week. Today, we\u2019d like your tips, please, for these races: 3.15 York, 3.45 York, 4.20 York. This week\u2019s prize is a copy of Addicted to Horse Racing by Norton Howells, a late convert to the greatest game, who tells us his tales of trying to crack the code of gambling success. \u201cThe writing is precise yet evocative, with nothing held back, as we discover the vivid consequences of an obsession,\u201d the press release tells me. If you don\u2019t win, you can buy a copy here. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today but you will start on -6. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.
