  "body": "One of the biggest casualties of the power struggle at the top of Turkey\u2019s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) may be the critically important deal with the EU on stemming the unprecedented flow of refugees to Europe from Syria\u2019s civil war.  Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, Turkey\u2019s pro-Europe prime minister who willstand down this month, was the key architect of the agreement engineered on the EU side by Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel. The deal reflected Davuto\u011flu\u2019s overall desire for closer Turkey-EU relations.  Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the authoritarian, neo-Islamist president \u2013 and Davuto\u011flu\u2019s political nemesis \u2013 has a less positive view of the EU. He has derided it as a \u201cChristian club\u201d and is resentful that Turkey\u2019s longstanding membership bid has been repeatedly obstructed. Perhaps the most appealing aspect of the refugee deal from a Turkish point of view \u2013 visa-free travel to the EU for Turkish citizens \u2013 was secured by Davuto\u011flu at a meeting in Brussels on 18 March. He believed it would bolster his position vis-\u00e1-vis Erdo\u011fan, with whom relations were increasingly strained.    Related: Ahmet Davuto\u011flu expected to step down as Turkish prime minister    The opposite happened. Erdo\u011fan claims the visa deal, endorsed by the EU commission on Wednesday, was his work and Davuto\u011flu should not take credit. \u201cDuring my time as prime minister it was announced [this] would come in October 2016. I don\u2019t understand why bringing it forward four months is presented as a win. I\u2019m saddened by the presentation of small things in a bigger light,\u201d he said this week. This public show of jealousy illustrated the extreme difficulty Erdo\u011fan has about sharing power. Having previously asserted control over the AKP, parliament, the army, the judiciary and, to a large extent, the media, Erdo\u011fan has found it impossible to co-habit happily with a prime minister he hand-picked in 2014 when he became president. Having fallen out in similar fashion with the former president Abdullah Gul, his former right-hand man and fellow AKP veteran, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s tensions with Davuto\u011flu spilled over this week when he crudely suggested he \u201cshould not forget how you got to your post\u201d. Erdo\u011fan has been barracking and undermining Davuto\u011flu\u2019s European outreach for months. He repeatedly complained Europe had left the Syrian migrant problem for Turkey to deal with. Last November he bluntly warned EU chiefs he could, if he wished, \u201cflood Europe\u201d with refugees.  Without the moderate Davuto\u011flu, a former foreign minister, to balance and temper Erdo\u011fan\u2019s behaviour, and with a more biddable prime minister in his place \u2013 reports suggest Erdo\u011fan\u2019s son-in-law, the energy minister Berat Albayrak, may get the job \u2013 the precarious EU refugee agreement could soon be in serious jeopardy. The prospect of Erdo\u011fan unbound suggests a number of other knotty problems may become more intractable. Davuto\u011flu privately opposed his cherished plan to change the constitution and create a Putin-style executive presidency. Erdo\u011fan can be expected to press ahead with what American and other critics say is an anti-democratic coup. Davuto\u011flu also argued with Erdo\u011fan over the pre-trial detention of journalists charged with insulting the president, an offence that has ensnared hundreds of people since 2014. The Turkish government\u2019s human rights abuses and disregard for press freedom and free speech are already a cause for considerable unease in European states and the European parliament. These tensions are set to grow.  Likewise the destabilising security crackdown on Kurdish areas of eastern Turkey ordered by Erdo\u011fan last autumn, and accompanying intimidation of pro-Kurdish MPs and activists, may intensify in the absence of Davuto\u011flu\u2019s restraining influence. The financial markets appear to think so. The Turkish lira fell sharply against the dollar on Thursday.  Unchecked by any credible opposition, Erdo\u011fan will be tempted to redouble his efforts to shift Turkey\u2019s strategic orientation away from Europe and the US and towards the Islamic world. His recent summit meeting in Ankara with King Salman of Saudi Arabia was part of this prospective realignment.   The evolving Saudi-Turkish axis has led to speculation about joint military intervention in Syria in support of the armed anti-Assad opposition, a plan previously floated by the Saudi defence minister. Erdo\u011fan has an ulterior motive. He would dearly like to take a shot at the US-backed Syrian Kurdish militias, whom he brands terrorists.  The uncertainty in Turkey comes at a particularly bad time in Syria. The ceasefire has crumbled and peace talks are at a standstill. Staffan de Mistura, the UN\u2019s Syria envoy, warned this week that a permanent end to fighting in Aleppo, where a 48-hour truce has been agreed, was vital. \u201cThe alternative is truly quite catastrophic. We could see 400,000 people moving towards the Turkish border,\u201d he said.   In one sense it is surprising Davuto\u011flu lasted as long as he did. His critics will argue the mild-mannered former academic and diplomat who did not expect to achieve high office should have done more to oppose Erdo\u011fan. But the president is a down-and-dirty political street-fighter. The two were never evenly matched. The critics may soon have greater cause for regret over Davuto\u011flu\u2019s forced departure. The Erdo\u011fan supremacy looks ever more unstoppable \u2013 and perilous.",
