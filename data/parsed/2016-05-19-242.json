  "body": "There is something inherently unsexy about wedding nights for the bride and groom concerned. After an exhausting day of nerves, relatives and quite possibly too much to drink, the last thing you feel like doing is getting up close and personal with the one you\u2019ve just vowed to spend your life with. More likely than bowing to the pressure to perform is throwing up or passing out. But it is a new low to hear of the Chinese civil servants who did not spend the night of their nuptials making the most of a lovely bed covered with swan-towels, balloons and rose petals. No: instead, they painstakingly copied out the Communist constitution - all 17,000 words of it - by hand, together, as an act of love (and party support). Was your wedding night even less romantic than this? We want to hear your stories of how your marriage got off to a disappointing start on the very first night. Leave your comments below the line, and we\u2019ll round up some of the best ones. You can also share your thoughts via @GuardianOpinion or on our Facebook page.",
