  "body": "Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush is inspired by Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte            Perhaps the most famous song with literary references, Kate Bush\u2019s Wuthering Heights relays the tale of Emily Bronte\u2019s gothic novel of the same name. Told through the point of view of Catherine during a ghostly visit to her old house, she calls to her lover, Heathcliff, to let her in through the window. Kate Bush\u2019s operatic voice and quirky dancing conveys the eerie spirit of the scene from chapter three of Wuthering Heights when she is seen by the new tenant, Mr Lockwood. Fun fact: Kate Bush and Emily Bronte share the same birthday.  We Are the Dead by David Bowie is inspired by 1984 by George Orwell            We Are the Dead is one of many tracks on David Bowie\u2019s Diamond Dogs album that pays homage to George Orwell\u2019s 1984. The title of the track is taken from a recurring line in the novel which simultaneously comments on the repressed \u201cinner and outer parties\u201d as well the protagonist\u2019s impending imprisonment by the thought police.  Fun fact: A great deal of the songs on this album were originally intended for a theatrical production of the novel, but Orwell\u2019s estate denied Bowie the rights.  Atticus by the Noisettes is inspired by To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee            This song by the Noisettes uses To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019s protagonist, Atticus, as a metaphor for fearlessness and integrity. Throughout Harper Lee\u2019s timeless classic, Atticus routinely demonstrates the sort of courage that Shingai Shoniwa sings about in the song of the same title, with a clear reference to the novel in the first line of the song: \u201cTo kill a mockingbird is to silence the song that seduces you\u201d.  Banana Co by Radiohead is inspired by One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez             In this Gabriel Garcia Marquez-inspired track, Radiohead use imagery from One Hundred Years of Solitude to relay the devastation that banana companies brought to a great deal of Latin American countries in the twentieth century.  Fun fact: This is of one of many references to literature in Radiohead\u2019s catalogue; their 1997 single, Paranoid Android, for example, is named after Marvin, the Paranoid Android from Douglas Adams\u2019 Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy series.  Hurricane by Thirty Seconds to Mars takes some inspiration from The Raven, by Edgar Allan Poe Poe\u2019s famous narrative poem The Raven tells the tale of a man who, plagued with the memories of a dead woman called Lenore, is visited by a talking raven in the dead of the night.  Although Hurricane was not explicitly written about The Raven, the conclusion of the uncensored director\u2019s cut of the music video for the single release directly quotes the following lines of the poem: \u201cDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before\u201d.             Despite the fact that Hurricane doesn\u2019t take its lyrical influence from Poe, themes from The Raven such as anxiety, death and lost love are echoed in it, which probably explains why it makes such a good fit with the music video!  Firework by Katy Perry is inspired by On the Road by Jack Kerouac Despite it\u2019s widely parodied opening line \u2013 \u201cDo you ever feel like a plastic bag\u201d \u2013 the chorus from the smash-hit Firework by Katy Perry has an unlikely source of inspiration: Jack Kerouac\u2019s Beat generation classic, On the Road.  Compare the lyrics:   you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine, just own the night like the 4th of July. Cause, baby, you\u2019re a firework, come on, show \u2018em what you\u2019re worth, make \u2018em go, aah, aah, aah, As you shoot across the sky.  \u2026 with this famous quotation from Kerouac\u2019s novel:  The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes, \u201cAwww!\u201d  \u2026 and you can see the similarities.             Fun fact: Katy Perry\u2019s ex-husband, Russell Brand is a huge fan of Kerouac. Katy Perry acknowledged the influence in a red carpet interview at the 2012 Grammy Nominations.  Thieves in the Night by Blackstar takes some inspiration from The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison  The Bluest Eye\u2019s exploration of the effects of racism and the cultural imposition of European standards of beauty on black people in late 1930s mid-western America (as told through the voice of the main character, Pecola, a little black girl who desperately wants blue eyes) is referenced in the song by the occasional hip-hop duo Mos Def and Talib Kweli.             Themes from Morrison\u2019s novel are used throughout the song as a means of echoing those same ideas, but as they applied to the other rappers and the wider African American community in 1998, when Black Star, Mos Def and Talib Kweli\u2019s collaborative album was released. Ramble On by Led Zepplin is inspired by Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien One of several Led Zeppelin songs said to have been inspired by JRR Tolkien\u2019s epic series, Ramble On is a re-imagining of the journey of Lord of the Rings characters Sam and Frodo. In this 1969 classic, a woman, and not the infamous ring, is the object of the narrator\u2019s obsessions. In the second verse for example, lead vocalist Robert Plant sings:   Related: Top 10 songs in teen novels: the ultimate young adult playlist     Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair, but Gollum and the evil one, crept up and slipped away with her.  Fun Fact: Robert Plant\u2019s dog, Strider, was allegedly named after Lord of the Rings character Aragorn, who is referred to by the same name at various points in the series.            Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones is inspired by The Master and the Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov  Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s surreal, anti-Stalinist satire played a part in inspiring this Stones staple. In parts of Sympathy for the Devil, Mick Jagger takes on a voice similar to that of The Master and the Margarita\u2019s devilish protagonist, mirroring the opening of the novel in which Satan, disguised as a mysterious, sophisticated figure, approaches two men in 1930s Russia, who are debating the existence of Jesus Christ.            Fun fact: Mick Jagger names nineteenth-century poet Charles Baudelaire as another source of inspiration for Sympathy for the Devil. Song for Clay by Bloc Party is inspired by Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis            Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s coming of age memoir is a fitting allusion for Song for Clay by broody indie band, Bloc Party. Often compared to J.D. Salinger\u2019s angsty bildungsroman, The Catcher in the Rye, Less Than Zero follows the experiences of the main character, Clay when he returns home to Los Angeles during his winter break from University in the 1980s. In Bloc Party\u2019s Song for Clay, references to the book\u2019s themes of youth, overindulgence and Ellis\u2019s exploration of the pervasiveness of early MTV culture \u2013 which, similar to social media today, had a huge impact on teenagers in the 1980s \u2013 are present in almost every line.   Related: How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?    Fun Fact: Less Than Zero was reportedly named after a Elvis Costello\u2019s 1977 song of the same name.

'Killing An Arab' was inspired by Camus's L'\u00c9tranger, and there's also 'Charlotte Sometimes'.\u2014 Alice Dryden (@Huskyteer) May 20, 2016    Eloise, via email You\u2019ve missed a great song inspired by a book: T\u2019Pau China in You Hand is inspired by Mary Shelley and Frankenstein. \u201cA theme she had on a scheme he had, told in a foreign land\u201d    @GuardianBooks @GdnChildrensBks I don't think most of those are young adult! What about Waterboys - Whole of the Moon, inspired by Narnia?\u2014 bob (@Dangerfieldfive) May 20, 2016    Emily via email Mumford and Sons \u2013 Dust Bowl Dance and Timshel are inspired by Steinbeck\u2019s Of Mice and Men. Mumford and Sons \u2013 Macbeth\u2019s \u2018Stars hide your fires, let not light see my black and deep desires\u2019 is quoted in Roll Away your Stone.    I always wondered whether The Dark is Rising by Mercury Rev was inspired by Susan Cooper's brilliant series. https://t.co/uhhMNTlBVT\u2014 Christopher Edge (@edgechristopher) May 20, 2016      @edgechristopher @GdnChildrensBks Looks like that's a yes!

Elliott's 'Preludes'.\u2014 DaveDickie (@Max_Fax) May 20, 2016      @GdnChildrensBks Lorde's Yellow Flicker Beat (Hunger Games) and Lana Del Rey's Off to the Races (Lolita)\u2014 Michele Banks (@artologica) May 20, 2016",
