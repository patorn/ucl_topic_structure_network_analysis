Over the 23 nights of the festival, the sails of the Sydney Opera House will be splashed in light. The 15 minute-long looped light artwork, Songlines, was created by a group of Indigenous Australian artists and musicians.     Australia\u2019s ancient songlines have been woven across the sails of the Sydney Opera House. Photograph: James Horan/Destination NSW    It\u2019s difficult to find an exact Western equivalent of the songlines, or dreaming tracks, so integral to the nations of Indigenous Australia. They are creation stories and historical archives of great spiritual weight, somewhat like the Bible. But they are also maps that trace the rivers, seas, mountains, seasons, plants, stars, sunrises, winds, animals, smells and emotions of the land.  They crisscross the earth, with every nation a keeper of certain passages, connecting in a vast network of trade routes. And while these tracks lie in the land and sky, they are nourished with song, storytelling, dance and painting. While some critics deride Vivid festival as nothing more than a glorified light show, now in its eighth year it has, arguably, become the most popular event on the city\u2019s cultural calendar. Most of its 80 installations dotted throughout the city are free to view and are set to attract big crowds. In 2015 the festival enjoyed a record 1.7 million attendees. One of the participating artists, Bundjalung artist Djon Mundine, says while the art favoured by Vivid is \u201ccertainly not as critical in thinking as the [Sydney] Biennale\u201d, the festival\u2019s popularity and accessibility makes it a significant spotlight to occupy for Indigenous Australia.  He believes the Songlines artwork will give the festival new artistic and spiritual heft. Vivid\u2019s \u201cwonderment\u201d, he says, must \u201cprogress into something [else], rather than just spectacle, and probably this is a step towards that\u201d. Songlines will also help locate the festival in Australia and operate as a \u201cwelcome to country\u201d for the entire event, he says. \u201cIt is just beautiful. It makes me very proud.\u201d Asked if there was any concern among the artists that the spirituality of these dreaming tracks would be compromised in decorating the Opera House, Mundine implies the work will speak for itself. \u201cWe\u2019re not here just dancing for tourists. This is an Aboriginal statement and the rest of it flows on.\u201d Songlines director and Sydney Opera House head of Indigenous programming Rhoda Roberts says this is a critical period for Indigenous Australians. \u201cWe\u2019re in a time when a lot of the tradition bearers or custodians of particular songs are passing away.\u201d That loss is often a result of Australia\u2019s history of colonialism and assimilationist policies that \u201coutlawed\u201d Indigenous Australian culture, she says. She condemns the amount of money Australia channels into the sports industry, while the arts industry must operate on the \u201csmell of an oily rag\u201d. \u201cOf course sports is fantastic, but please, face what we\u2019re facing! There is no other country in the world that hosts the oldest living culture. We will not be the generation that loses the knowledge.\u201d  Of the six artists featured in Songlines, there is representation from three major nations of New South Wales: Mundine (Bundjalung in the north-east), Reko Rennie (Gamilaroi in the north-east), Karla Dickens (Wiradjuri in the south-east); alongside Gabriella Possum (Anmatyerre of the Central Desert) and Donny Woolagoodja (Worora of the Kimberley region in Western Australia) and the late Gulumbu Yunupingu (Yolngu of Arnhem Land). Roberts says in the animation process she was \u201cvery careful\u201d about preserving the specific cultural nuances of each work. \u201cYou have to be very aware that you\u2019re not being inappropriate with the way that you\u2019re using the work.\u201d   Related: Vivid Sydney: Bjo\u0308rk joins New Order and Spike Jonze on 2016 lineup    The project\u2019s musical composer, David Page, died two weeks before he was due to deliver the score. Damian Robinson of Wicked Beat Soul System was quickly enlisted, and Roberts says the final soundtrack features \u201ca song man from the north and a song man from the south\u201d: respectively, Djakapurra Munyarryun and Cecil McLeod. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely beautiful and we dedicate it to the late David Page.\u201d     Djon Mundine and Rhoda Roberts at the Sydney Opera House. Photograph: Alexander Kirk    Roberts says the Sydney Opera House has long shown leadership in the inclusion of Indigenous Australia, and is one of the few Australian arts organisations to enact a reconciliation plan. Since Roberts took up her role five years ago, the opera house has increased its number of Indigenous Australian staff from three to 21 members. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge commitment from every department,\u201d she says. \u201cWe embed Aboriginal culture across everything that we do at the Opera House, including the food, music, front of house and tech.\u201d Mundine says considering the historical subjugation of his people in Australia, the significance of such a prestigious venue playing canvas to an Aboriginal artwork, and at such a major festival, should not be underplayed. \u201cRight at the epitome of the symbolic order of Western civilisation \u2013 high art, opera \u2013 you\u2019ve got Aboriginal imagery embodied on it. It\u2019s very meaningful.\u201d  Songlines is at Vivid Sydney 2016 which runs from 27 May to 18 June",
