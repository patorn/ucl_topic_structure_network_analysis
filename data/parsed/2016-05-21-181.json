  "body": "I\u2019m worried a bad job interview is going to count against me in future I am in my 50s, work in a niche market overseas and am looking for a new job in the same field.\u00a0I recently had an interview for an excellent post a long way from home. I was very well qualified for the position, have all the necessary experience and did well in the assessments. Unfortunately, the logistics of taking the job, coupled with insufficient preparation, flummoxed me\u00a0on the day and I totally lost confidence and performed very poorly in the interview itself. I feel I let myself down and that I possibly showed a lack of respect in performing so badly. My real worry now, looking back on the whole sorry experience, is that it could be held against me in future. As I say, I work in a niche market which is quite a close-knit working community.  Could I credibly apply for a post at the same institution again? Is it just a matter of live and learn and put it down to experience and try again? In short, how should I handle it? Jeremy says I wish I knew why and how \u201cthe logistics of taking the job\u201d managed to flummox you so badly. But I assume that this was uncharacteristic behaviour on your part and that you don\u2019t easily fall apart when under slight stress. That being so, I think you\u2019re overreacting to this setback. I very much doubt if news of your unfortunate interview has spread throughout this community, however close-knit it may be. Indeed, I believe you\u2019d even be wrong to write off your chances of getting a job with this same organisation. The positives still stand: you\u2019re well qualified for the job, you\u2019ve got the relevant experience, and you did well in the assessments. To a potential employer, these should be more important considerations than your performance in a single interview. Employing great thoughtfulness, I think you should write a letter (not an email) addressed to the most senior person who interviewed you. Say that your brief exposure to the organisation greatly increased both your admiration for it and your serious interest in working with it, so your mortification at having made such a poor showing at the interview is all the more frustrating and is still bothering you. Since in every other respect you believe you\u2019ve shown yourself to be a potentially valuable member of the company, you wonder if they might make an exception to their usual recruitment practice and grant you a second interview. You might want to add some explanation for your poor showing at the interview but my instinct is that you\u2019d be better advised to leave it open. If the impressions you made prior to the interview were as positive as you hope and believe, I think you\u2019ve got a realistic chance of receiving a second opportunity to reveal your real and more collected self. Readers say  \u2022 You won\u2019t know if it\u2019s an issue unless you apply again. Chalk it up as a learning experience, identifying what needs improvement for next time. The worst thing you can do is approach new interviews with a negative mindset as it could affect your performance. If anything, use it as motivation that you want to prove yourself and show the interviewers what you\u2019re really like. FatherChewyLouie \u2022 The important thing is that you\u2019ve identified why the interview went badly \u2013 particularly the poor preparation. Addressing the causes of a poor result is the best way to approach future interviews with confidence. Go into the next interview with better prep and the objective of being the most impressive candidate they will encounter. starterforten \u2022 You\u2019ve identified why you didn\u2019t do well, and will need to address these things next time around, but there\u2019s no good reason not to apply again \u2013 if you\u2019re capable at your job I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll want to hear from you. VSLVSL How can I manage a forceful colleague who is undermining my authority? I manage someone who is a real game player. I very definitely am not. I\u2019m pretty sure she is manipulating me, using my niceness and lack of guile against me: my manager has warned me that she is doing this. She is a strong and forceful person, with definite ideas of how everything should be done, and a bit of a ruthless streak. I don\u2019t want to stoop to her level. I\u2019m not cut out to play her at her own game \u2013 it\u2019s not in my nature \u2013 but I\u2019d like her to know that I do see through her. How can I make sure she doesn\u2019t undermine me or make me look stupid to others, and manage her effectively? Jeremy says You describe a familiar set of characteristics. People like this can be fiendishly difficult to manage, and you are absolutely right in your determination not to attempt to play her at her own game. You couldn\u2019t possibly win and would only end up looking foolish. But I\u2019m not so sure that you\u2019re right in wanting her to know you see through her. I believe the only way to deal with such complicated and manipulative characters is to treat them as you would treat everyone else. Ignore her games and attempts to get under your skin. Don\u2019t respond in any way when she goads you or teases you, other than to be immovably, unshakeably, boringly placid. It won\u2019t be easy to start with, but once you get the hang of it, it will become almost second nature. Her initial reaction is likely to be to become even more provocative \u2013 and this will test you still further. You mustn\u2019t give the slightest indication that she\u2019s getting to you. The kicks she gets from her behaviour depend on an appreciative audience enjoying the sight of her running rings round someone who\u2019s meant to be in authority over her. By remaining utterly unmoved, you\u2019ll deny her audience such enjoyment and so, in turn, her own satisfaction. Sooner rather than later, she\u2019ll realise that her audience is beginning to enjoy the spectacle of you remaining totally impervious to her gibes, and the increasing frustration she\u2019ll in some way exhibit. When that happens, you\u2019ll have won. But you mustn\u2019t, by even the smallest of reactions, show that you\u2019ve noticed. Readers say  \u2022 You need to realise that unless you are willing to be more assertive you will forever have problems as a manager. It is very simple, use sentences like: \u201cThat is not appropriate\u201d; \u201cThat is not part of your role\u201d; \u201cIf you are not happy with how I do X then we will have a meeting to discuss it\u201d. Make sure you let slip that upper managers have noticed her behaviour. If she tries to challenge you, say: \u201cOK, we will discuss your work performance in a meeting,\u201d and if she continues, say: \u201cOK, this is more of a company issue, let\u2019s have a meeting with higher managers involved, too, and that way we can address your concerns\u201d. You could take it further and say: \u201cUpper manager/management policy is \u2026 \u201d. caramel10 \u2022 Language is often a useful tool. Even a simple \u201cthank you for your opinion\u201d is often enough, because you have obviously demonstrated respect. Also: \u201cWell, of course, speaking as the manager here ...\u201d and such. oommph \u2022 Give clear reasons why you\u2019re making certain decisions, but try to come to a mutual agreement \u2013 one of the reasons she may be going off-piste is because she feels disengaged and she may actually have some valid opinions. It might be worth reminding her about courtesy and respect at work. lace675468 Do you need advice on a work issue?
