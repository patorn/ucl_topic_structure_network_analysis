  "body": "The word Mum appears on my phone\u2019s screen and I swipe right. I\u2019ve been expecting this call. I\u2019m prepared for the worst. \u201cIt turned out to be cancer after all,\u201d she says. I say nothing as I step into the garden. With a voice as soft as honey, she tells me they can\u2019t operate. \u201cOK,\u201d I say, unable to think of anything better. \u201cThe tumour\u2019s in my gullet \u2026 \u201d she says, and for a few seconds while she struggles to breathe, there is a thick and heavy silence. \u201c\u2026 and my spinal cord.\u201d   Related: We are all just a millimetre away from death, all the time. If only we knew it | Cory Taylor    Four weeks earlier, mum had a lung biopsy, and I knew that the news wouldn\u2019t be good when she was asked to meet the consultant to discuss her test results. \u201cSo it\u2019s not lung cancer?\u201d I say. And the last remnants of hope slip away as she confirms that it is, and she\u2019s no longer on the transplant list. My head is heavy and my eyeballs throb in their sockets. Never short of something to say, all I can manage is um and ah, until I inhale with a quivering breath and blurt: \u201cHave you had lunch?\u201d Despite reading almost every piece of advice about supporting a loved one with a life-limiting illness, I\u2019m asking the woman who has mothered me for 49 years, the woman who gave birth to me at 17, the woman who has been a wife to my father for half a century, if she\u2019s had lunch. I want to slap myself across the face and go straight to the stupid corner. She reassures me she will eat soon and I say: \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Then, lost for words, I say: \u201cGoodbye.\u201d For the first time in my life, goodbye becomes a meaningful and powerful word. Goodbye, like a gong counting down the moments. Good \u2013 bye, I hear myself say as I walk back into the house. Goodbye, I sob. I don\u2019t want to say goodbye. I call my sister for the third time today. We haven\u2019t slept much over the last few weeks, and Dr Google hasn\u2019t helped. Now we decide it\u2019s our mother\u2019s fault, putting us through this torment, this waiting. We laugh at the ridiculousness of this notion, and pretend we\u2019re saying it to Mum, in a scolding way, like she\u2019s a naughty child, giving us unnecessary worry. And then we\u2019re sad at the reality of what she\u2019s facing and we feel a thousand times worse.           We\u2019re being forced to fix our own mental health. And it\u2019s not working    We admit to terrible thoughts. We don\u2019t want her to travel miles away to have treatment that will burn her skin or make her hair fall out. We want her to die soon so she won\u2019t have to suffer. And we weep, because we desperately want her to live. I want to get on the first flight home, but my mother doesn\u2019t want me to come. I feel rejected and salve the sting by telling myself she\u2019s in denial or preparing me for her forthcoming absence. She is grieving, and I know she has every right. My grief feels wrong. Jessica Mitchell, national helpline manager for the charity Cruse Bereavement Care, describes anticipatory grief as: \u201cSomething that can happen to a person who is \u2018waiting\u2019 for a loved one to die. It can also happen to a dying person. The family member or dying person is living in a state of expectation of death and this leads to grief.\u201d Mindfulness goes out of the window, I\u2019m too busy living in the future; planning for life without the woman who means more to me than any other. In my head I\u2019m writing a speech for her funeral, and I\u2019m jotting down details about sending her off with a bang. Her ashes in fireworks, maybe. A great idea, I think, unless she wants to be buried.   Related: Give children a stake in society to improve their mental health    And I wonder if she\u2019s got a decent photo for the memorial card, because she mentioned that to me once. She told me that I was never to reveal her true age, so I\u2019m not sure what date should be carved on her tombstone or even if she wants one. I want people to know my pain, but no one has died, so nobody is \u201csorry for my loss\u201d. I want to scream, MY MOTHER IS DYING, but sensibility creeps back and I remember that everybody\u2019s mother is dying. We are all dying. It happens. Death happens. And I must \u201cbrace myself\u201d when the violence of my mother\u2019s death does eventually hit me \u2013 like a hatchet. Mum\u2019s phone call, all two minutes and six seconds of it, marked the beginning of the end. I need to remember that there is a whole lot of living to be done before then. There is solace in grief; relief after each episode, a feeling of healing and release, and I\u2019m doing my best to embrace it. \u2022 Cruse Bereavement Care  offers support after the death of someone close.
