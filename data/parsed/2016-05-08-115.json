  "body": "Sadiq Khan, the new Labour mayor of London, has refused to endorse the party\u2019s local election posters, signed off by Jeremy Corbyn, that urged voters to \u201ctake sides\u201d.   Related: Osborne says Goldsmith's mayoral campaign was political 'rough and tumble' - live    In a clear signal that he will use his position to set out an alternative direction for Labour, Britain\u2019s most powerful directly elected politician said the party could only win elections by uniting people from all backgrounds \u2013 including former Conservative voters \u2013 rather than aiming to win over \u201cjust enough of the population \u2026 to get over the line\u201d. In an article for the Observer, Khan had appeared to directly contradict Corbyn\u2019s electoral strategy, writing: \u201cIt should never be about \u2018picking sides\u2019, [or] a \u2018them-or-us\u2019 attitude,\u201d Khan wrote. \u201cOur aim should be to unite people from all backgrounds as a broad and welcoming tent \u2013 not to divide and rule.\u201d Asked directly by Andrew Marr on his BBC show if he was criticising Labour\u2019s poster, Khan said: \u201cMy point was I want Labour to be a big tent, and if we want to form the next government we need to speak to everyone, not just Labour voters, not just our core vote. I have to speak to chief executives, people who voted Conservative last time, Ukip or stayed at home.\u201d     Jeremy Corbyn stands in front of a Labour campaign poster before the local elections last Thursday. Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP    Khan\u2019s intervention will reignite the battle within the Labour party over whether Corbyn\u2019s decision to move his party to the left is the correct strategy to chart a course to a 2020 general election victory. Diane Abbott, a key Corbyn ally, said as the polls closed on Thursday night that if Khan won in London, it would be \u201call about Jeremy\u201d; but Khan suggested he had taken an inclusive approach, spending as much time in the traditionally Tory London boroughs such as Kensington and Chelsea as he did in Hackney or Camden. Khan has repeatedly sought to distance himself from Corbyn, holding few joint campaign appearances and leaving him off his publicity material. He also urged his leader to \u201cget a grip\u201d on accusations of antisemitism in the party. With almost all the local election votes counted, Labour had lost a net 24 council seats in England, but narrowed the gap with the Conservatives in its national vote share. The results were better for Labour than many experts had predicted. Corbyn\u2019s election strategist, Jon Trickett, described them as \u201cfantastic\u201d \u2013 but Corbyn\u2019s critics say they show the party is far from on track to achieve a general election victory in four years\u2019 time. The election expert Prof John Curtice told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cOppositions that are clearly on the road back to power give their opponents a drubbing, not just a mild poke in the ribs.\u201d",
