  "body": "Elliott Smith \u2013 Angeles I love Elliott Smith. His voice is so real and fragile. There is a great live clip of this song, in which he forgets the lyrics, stops and swears. Everyone in the crowd laughs and whoops and he smiles. But then it goes quiet and he just looks so lonely, like he wants to cry. I wish I\u2019d met him.             The Beat \u2013 Mirror in the Bathroom  Gaz [Coombes] and I covered this song as the Hot Rats on our album Turn Ons. I love the deadpan delivery and the punky dance riffs and hooks.            Midlake \u2013 Roscoe There is something about the production of this song that is fantastic. The closeness of the recording sounds good on any sound system. Although it is full of dreamy harmonies, it still retains a menacing hardness in its sound.            Little Simz \u2013 Wings I saw her on Jools Holland last year performing this song and I instantly thought she was great. She has a real presence and individuality. A Curious Tale of Trials and Persons is a beast of a debut.            Jimi Hendrix \u2013 All Along the Watchtower Whenever I need a musical shot in the arm, this never fails to deliver. The instrumentation on it is almost otherworldly and totally crosses all rock\u2019n\u2019roll, punk and dance boundaries. Jimi played the bass on this and it\u2019s totally bonkers! Mitch Mitchell is my favourite drummer and this is him at his best.",
