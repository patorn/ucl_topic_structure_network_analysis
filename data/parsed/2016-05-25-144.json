  "body": "The World of Warcraft online game apparently had 12 million players at its peak, and every single one of them is going to need to turn up to see this \u2013 with their extended families \u2013 if it\u2019s ever going to get past its first instalment. It\u2019s an expensive, high-fantasy epic reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. And there\u2019s much to admire in its ambition, its design, even its politics. But there\u2019s also a whiff of the John Carter about it. Like the 2012 Martian flop, it\u2019s a complex, jargon-heavy, deadly earnest battle epic, short on star power and with more than a touch of 1970s fantasy art about it. Its greatest battle could be against widespread indifference. Newcomers have a lot to get up to speed with here. Our home world is Azeroth, a Middle-earth-like realm along the lines of medieval Europe. The population is mostly human, mostly white, but there are also dwarves, elves and various other mythical creatures in the fringes. Azeroth\u2019s stability is rocked by a sudden influx of orcs, who pour in from another world through a magic portal. These orcs aren\u2019t the anonymous monsters of Tolkien lore; they\u2019re more like intelligent ogres, with tiny heads, tusk-like lower canines, and giant hands with fingers the size of human arms. When it comes to orc style, the art directors have really gone to town \u2013 or at least to the abattoir. Accessories include dreadlocks, piercings, hides, pelts and not just bones but entire animal skeletons. One badass has rhino skulls as shoulder pads, another has piercings through his tusks. \u201cWe must summon the Guardian!\u201d say the good folk of Azeroth at the sight of these invading orcs, referring not to a leading liberal newspaper but a wizard in a tower, humourlessly played by Ben Foster. We first find this long-haired mage working on his sculpture, wearing leather trousers and no shirt \u2013 never a good sign. Together with the young king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga), her brother (Travis Fimmel \u2013 think Aragorn without the charisma) and a young apprentice wizard (Ben Schnetzer), they must mount a resistance.   Related: Duncan Jones: 'Warcraft will right the wrongs of game movies'    The prospect of a predominantly white, European realm being invaded by foreign, primitive, darker skinned hordes (they are actually called the Horde) might set alarm bells ringing in our current climate of immigration anxiety. Is this a veiled Ukip broadcast? Or a pro-Trump one? Nobody suggests the orcs are there to steal Azeroth\u2019s jobs or exploit its benefits system, thankfully, though they are intent on overrunning their adoptive country and sucking the souls out of all its living creatures.  To its credit, Warcraft does blur the us v them battle lines. The first character we meet is Durotan, a principled orc chieftan and new father, played in expressive performance capture by Toby Kebbell (he\u2019s lighter skinned than other, more evil orcs but let\u2019s not dwell on that). Durotan has his doubts about the soul-sucking orc leader and attempts to broker a deal with the humans. There\u2019s also Garona, a green-skinned half-orc, half-human with divided loyalties. Played by Paula Patton, she\u2019s one of the story\u2019s most intriguing characters, a tough-talking warrior concealing a traumatic past. We want to find out more about her, but between plot demands and the speech impediment caused by her prosthetic dentistry, we don\u2019t really get to. That\u2019s part of the problem with Warcraft: there\u2019s a lot going on and yet we\u2019re never quite engaged with it. In The Lord of the Rings, we had the Shire, the Hobbits\u2019 idyllic pastoral realm, as an image of what everyone was fighting for \u2013 one that 20th-century Europeans could easily relate to. Here, we barely see Azeroth outside the royal castles and wizards\u2019 towers and epic battlegrounds. The heavy use of CGI, and its occasionally awkward interactions with the live-action elements, only serves to distance us even more. Much processing power has been put in the service of spectacular, bludgeoning combat, but the images are somehow insubstantial, and we rarely feel the heat of the battle. Perhaps both problems are down to the film\u2019s computer game origins. Director Duncan Jones, a self-professed Warcraft fan, has clearly put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story, but it\u2019s questionable whether it was ever really merited. There\u2019s a terminal flimsiness, as if this virtually-derived world hasn\u2019t quite assumed three dimensions.",
