From this vantage point (at a port that, you\u2019ll remember, sparked a parliamentary inquiry over whether the Chinese would use it to spy on Australia) he delivered a takedown of Labor\u2019s stance on asylum seekers. To paraphrase, the \u201cprofessional ... capable, courageous and committed\u201d border force can only ever be so professional, capable, courageous and committed with \u201cstrong leadership\u201d of the kind Bill Shorten and Labor cannot deliver. Turnbull said Shorten\u2019s deputy Tanya Plibersek and his candidates were \u201ccrab-walking away in the direction of the Greens ... they lack the conviction and commitment to keep our borders secure.\u201d Though Turnbull had nothing but praise for the Australian Border Force, camera people at the press conference were told not to photograph the PM with the logo, lest his visit be seen as political. Heaven forbid!    We're told not to take photos of the ABF logo or the boat's radar because \"they don't want it politicised\". But PM is here for a presser...\u2014 Michael Koziol (@michaelkoziol) May 17, 2016      Now it's clarified that we can take pics of the boat, just not ones with the PM next to the ABF logo...\u2014 Michael Koziol (@michaelkoziol) May 17, 2016    The snaps we\u2019ve seen suggest that request may have gone unheard \u2013 and fair enough, when even Turnbull seemed unaware of it.      Later, he doubled down on his original message, saying that asylum seekers in Indonesia knew they couldn\u2019t get to Australia \u201cbecause of my government\u2019s determination to stop the boats and intercept them ... That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had over 600 days without any unauthorised arrivals.\u201d Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young paraphrased on Twitter: \u201cDay 10 of election campaign and Malcom Turnbull tells voters they should vote for his party because they\u2019re best at beating up on refugees.\u201d     Turnbull on the offensive about boats. A sign of strength or a sign of weakness? https://t.co/q6SzdnjVmf\u2014 Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) May 17, 2016    Deputy political editor, Katharine Murphy, in the blog wrote: going in for the kill on asylum boats was Turnbull\u2019s only objective today \u2013 a far cry from the man who showed \u201ca tiny wobble of compassion\u201d about conditions in offshore detention in an interview after taking the party leadership from Tony Abbott. (On that note, here\u2019s political editor Lenore Taylor\u2019s profile on the PM.) \u201cTurnbull\u2019s little speech today may in fact be inspired by Shorten performing better than expected,\u201d Murph wrote. \u201cGoing into this campaign, the Coalition was planning a campaign of affirmation \u2026 but here we are in week two and various people, including the prime minister today, are ramping up the attack lines.\u201d Shorten took issue with Turnbull\u2019s statement that Labor would wind back the Coalition\u2019s border protection policy. In Murph\u2019s fact check, she wrote that the major party policies overlap entirely on boat turn backs and offshore processing, but differ on oversight of the detention centres and also on the humanitarian intake. Labor is proposing changes to the Coalition\u2019s policies on those two issues \u2013 and, in that regard, Plibersek\u2019s statement that Labor\u2019s border protection policy is different to the government\u2019s is correct. But there are internal divisions on the boats policy, as we saw at the party\u2019s national conference last year. \u201cNot everyone was happy with the resolution of the policy,\u201d Murph recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s called politics.\u201d    Omen?

The proposed changes would see holidaymakers treated as non-residents and taxed at 32.5% from their first dollar. Currently, they are able to access the $18,200 tax-free threshold. According to Treasury projections, the tax would raise $540m \u2013 but since that figure was reached a year ago, in budget 2015, the Tourism and Transport Forum claims there has been a 6% or 7% drop in applications for working holiday visas. Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, told Guardian Australia he was \u201cdetermined to kill this tax and kill it now\u201d. But neither he nor Labor\u2019s tourism spokesman, Anthony Albanese, would finalise the Labor party\u2019s position on the tax until the revenue it would raise had been clarified. Hmm. Maybe it\u2019s only ever a money-grab when you\u2019re in opposition.  In any case, the delay will cost $40m, but the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said that had been factored in the most recent budget \u2013 the decision was just announced today, not made. Righto. Shorten backs Clinton 2016, puts Trump in too hard basket Bill Shorten today endorsed Hillary Clinton over the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump. There\u2019s plenty you can take umbrage with Trump over: his problematic views of and relationships with women, his aggressive yet perversely creative border protection policies, his spray tan. Shorten\u2019s chief concern \u2013 which lost Trump his endorsement \u2013 is that Trump that would be \u201cvery difficult to deal with\u201d. \u201cI have to say that if I was in America I would be voting for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cWhoever America elect we\u2019ll work with, but there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Trump would be very difficult, I think, to deal with.\u201d His endorsement was somewhat more tentative than that given by former prime minister John Howard in 2007. Beginning \u201cIf I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq\u201d \u2013 never not a good idea \u2013 he warned that the election of then-US Democratic presidential aspirant Barack Obama would be a boost for terrorists. How far we\u2019ve come. That enjoyable trip down memory lane aside, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said at the Lowy Institute that Australia must break free of the US if it is to become a \u201cconfident and courageous country\u201d. Shorten said that was another \u201csilly\u201d Greens idea, adding that Labor would \u201cstick to the American alliance full stop\u201d. Best of Bowers     No logos? Mike Bowers follows Malcolm Turnbull onto yet another dock \u2013 this one for a border force vessel in Darwin, where media were asked not to include the Australian Border Force logo in photos so that the (election campaign) visit wouldn\u2019t seem \u2018political\u2019. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian    Further reading \u2022 Another election, another excuse to play the punters for mugs. Election 2016 is just as manufactured and banal as the campaigns that came before it, writes Richard Ackland \u2013 in the race to win the day, voters are the only losers. \u2022 Crowds bite back at savage response to Duncan Storrar\u2019s simple Q&A question (Fairfax Media). \u201cStorrar dared to speak a simple truth \u2013 not even a particularly radical one ... For this, he had to be destroyed, and not simply refuted.\u201d (Duncan Storrar put out a statement via Media Watch on Monday.) \u2022 The question that shows that Malcolm Turnbull will probably win the election (Fairfax Media) Clickbait headline aside, why is it that asking people \u201cwho will win?\u201d is a more powerful predictor of election outcomes than asking \u201cwho will you vote for?\u201d And also ...           Ayaan Hirsi Ali on Q&A: do not subject Muslims to bigotry of low expectations    The Somali-born author and human rights campaigner, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, has said it is becoming increasingly difficult to criticise Islam and Muslims in western countries such as Australia: \u201cwe only see them [Muslims] through this prism of victims and victimisation\u201d. She appeared on the ABC\u2019s Q&A on Monday night alongside the British rapper, poet and author, Kate Tempest, who performed her poem Progress.           Poet Kate Tempest\u2019s powerful performance on Q&A    Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ...     Garage accommodation in Otara, south Auckland, New Zealand. Photograph: Michael Clatworthy    Hundreds of families in Auckland are living in cars, garages and even a shipping container due to a housing crisis in New Zealand\u2019s biggest city. Rising property prices have forced low-income workers out of private rental accommodation, say charity groups. Auckland\u2019s housing market is one of the most expensive in the world, with the average price more than NZ $940,000 (AU $870,745). Combined with low interest rates, rising migration, near full occupancy of state housing in South Auckland, and minimal wage rises, the pressure on many low to middle income earners has become too much to bear, writes Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin. All this considered, it casts this public Facebook post by the son of the New Zealand prime minister John Key in a new light.    bit different when your dad is prime minister of New Zealand pic.twitter.com/OKbk5Yqlta\u2014 Elle Hunt (@mlle_elle) May 17, 2016    And if today was a pop song ... Turnbull planted a \u201cvery, very special\u201d (her words) kiss \u2013 his first of the campaign \u2013 on 84-year-old Audrey Pratt of Adelaide on Friday. It was only a matter of time until Shorten caught up and he did so today \u2013 also in Adelaide, where he announced $500m from a Labor government for a citywide tram network. But according to AAP\u2019s report \u2013 and backed up by footage \u2013 Shorten was \u201cmanhandled\u201d into the embrace by Margo Carey, 49. She\u2019d asked for a \u201ckiss and a cuddle for the cameras\u201d, then lifted Shorten onto her lap. \u201cGood on you, Margo,\u201d a \u201cblushing\u201d Shorten replied. Carey then demanded a \u201cproper kiss\u201d from Shorten and coopted him as he went for the cheek. When she was later asked why, she said: \u201cBecause I\u2019m an attention seeker.\u201d     Margo Carey, 49, says hello to the Opposition Leader. pic.twitter.com/qI4KMEJk48\u2014 joe kelly (@joekellyoz) May 17, 2016      Margo pulls Bill Shorten in for a \"cuddle\" https://t.co/GxnUBvq1Rc\u2014 ellinghausen (@ellinghausen) May 17, 2016      Bill Shorten gets up close and personal on the campaign trail.

Hope Shorten and Turnbull have their Chapsticks on them.         \u201cI won\u2019t be able to see you any more because of my obligations ... to the Labor party.\u201d         Never miss another catchup: If you\u2019re reading this in the Guardian app, tap on \u2018Australian election briefing\u2019 at the top or bottom of this page, then tap on \u2018Follow series\u2019 to get an app notification as soon as the Campaign catchup publishes every afternoon.",
