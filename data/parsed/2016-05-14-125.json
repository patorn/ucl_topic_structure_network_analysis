Directors UK found that between 2005 and 2014, just 13.6% of British films were directed by women, and that only 14.6% of those films had a female screenwriter.  The statistics are clear \u2013 and the scale of inequality is backed up by a University of Southampton report, which found women made up just a fifth of production personnel working on UK films in 2015.  Women working in various roles in the industry, from young runners to experienced and award-winning directors who responded to the Guardan call out have described some of the difficulties they have faced in their careers.   One young assistant said she had been offered limited working dates compared to male colleagues because managers didn\u2019t believe she would be of any help rigging the set or \u201chelping carry things\u201d. Others have spoken about systemic bias that holds them back. Here are some of their experiences.  \u2018There\u2019s a surge of anger about the inequality in film\u2019 Conscious and unconscious bias is alive and well in our business. And much is to do with how \u201ctalent\u201d is evaluated. Because of the belief in the auteur, a concept that has infected the film space but particularly public funding, women have been at a disadvantage \u2013 auteurs are generally men and if you can\u2019t see it, not only can\u2019t you be it, but no one will let you be it either. The way women\u2019s work is assessed and their talent rated doesn\u2019t cut it, because they\u2019re being measured against a male paradigm.  This isn\u2019t only because of male executives ruling the roost \u2013 at one point not long ago most major public funds were headed by women and it changed almost nothing.  There\u2019s a surge of anger about the inequality in film and a push for actions not words, to quote the suffragettes \u2013 this is a wave I and many others want to keep riding until we see meaningful change.Mia Bays, film producer, 44 \u2018Though my film has been successful I can\u2019t get on the next rung of the ladder\u2019 I am not surprised by the studies\u2019 findings at all; I know it\u2019s virtually impossible to make a feature film as a woman. There are lots of talented women out there who simply aren\u2019t being given the chance to make work and become role models \u2013 and the UK industry as a whole rarely seems to get excited about women who do break through. I have had people walk away from me mid conversation at film events when I told them I, a woman, was making a feature length film and even though my film has been successful I can\u2019t even get on the next rung of the ladder. I have many female friends who left for the US, and are making films with US money and backing as they never had any interest here, which shouldn\u2019t have to happen.      Amy Mathieson with a Phantom slow motion camera on the set of her film, 1 Way Up. Photograph: Laura Marie Linck    I started as a runner at an edit house and have worked in many of the behind-the-scenes jobs in film and TV, seeing time and again men getting promoted first or given opportunities to shoot or take on technical or creative responsibility first. I am not at all suprised that so few women make a second, third or fourth film: it is such a sad state of affairs.Amy Mathieson, director/producer, 30 \u2018The boys club mentality is rewarded time and again\u2019 Sadly, the results of the recent study are not surprising, and the problem of gender-bias does not exist only in our industry. It is a part of a larger problem \u2013 a systemic, ingrained and institutionalized one. I am not able to explain the lack of female writer and directors concisely, but will offer that the continued comfort level and \u2018boys club\u2019 mentality is one that is rewarded time and again by executives, audiences and finance entities \u2013 so what is the motivation to change? When one can point to a successful outing by a female writer or director, it is largely ignored.     Director Jenna Ricker talks with Matthew Broderick and Greg Stuhr on the set of The American Side. Photograph: Ginny Rose Stewart    It\u2019s not easy to make a film for anyone. What becomes a larger mountain for women is that their content, ability to \u2018be in charge\u2019, and viability is questioned in a way that of our male counterparts are not. My current film is a noir-inspired mystery. I constantly hear how \u2018interesting\u2019 it is that I wrote and directed a \u2018masculine\u2019 film. No one is ascribing a gender to the genres male directors are directing. The initiatives in Sweden, and potentially the UK, begin a dialogue and process that may level the playing field just enough to begin moving the needle. In the US, if tax- incentive programs were to take on the same 50/50 model, I think there\u2019s a shot the sands would shift, albeit slowly. I\u2019m hopeful anyway.Jenna Ricker, writer and director, 40 \u2018Is it because I\u2019m a production assistant, or because I\u2019m a woman?\u2019 I have worked within the industry for three years: you could say being a runner or production assistant like me is already at the \u2018bottom of the food chain\u2019, but being a woman has definitely left me the lowest of the bunch. I\u2019ve had multiple encounters with male colleagues who have doubted my qualities and capabilities. These examples can range from being called \u201csweetheart\u201d, \u201cdarling\u201d and \u201clove\u201d in a patronising tone, to being told I can\u2019t help lift equipment because I\u2019m a girl to not being able to join in on male \u2018banter\u2019 because they\u2019re talking filthily about the female actress on set. When working your way up from the bottom, you don\u2019t wish to get on anyone\u2019s bad side as you\u2019ll do anything to work on a job. So when you\u2019re on set with 95% men and 5% women (who are usually hair and make up), you try not to step on anyone\u2019s toes. But every time you\u2019re told to \u2018stay in your place\u2019, you have to question, is it because I\u2019m a production assistant, or because I\u2019m a woman?  There are so many talented females within the film industry who I don\u2019t think get the opportunities they deserve and have worked for. I 100% agree with the idea of half of public funding heading towards women-led projects.Name witheld, production assistant, 22 \u2018Those in power are fully aware of the sexism\u2019     Caitlin McCarthy at the 2010 Action on Film International Film Festival.    As an American, I kept nodding my head while reading the report commissioned by Directors UK. Female directors and screenwriters are being excluded from employment opportunities throughout the world. My charitable explanation for this epidemic is that an unconscious bias may be taking place with those in power. My less charitable explanation is that those in power are fully aware of the sexism, but don\u2019t feel like addressing it because they\u2019re having a nice day and their male buddies are landing jobs \u2013 so \u2018who cares?\u2019 One thing I know is this: I\u2019m not going to quit. I want to be the change. Many brave women within the industry are speaking about sexism, but more male voices (like that of the amazing Paul Feig) throughout the industry need to be heard.  Pressure needs to be placed on financiers, producers, studios, agents, and managers to work with women, and this needs to come from both women and men, especially A-listers and greenlighters who can affect change without threat of blacklisting.Caitlin McCarthy, screenwriter  \u2018We don\u2019t want to be seeing a report in five years time with the same statistics\u2019 As a female filmmaker trying to forge my path into the UK film industry, the recently released statistics are extremely demoralising. Any creative career is extremely difficult to become recognised and successful in for everyone, but seeing that just over 50% of film students are female and yet only 13.6% of working film directors are female shows that something has gone very wrong. We just want our voices to be heard, and we are working hard to achieve our ambitions, and we never want the fact that we are female to ever be the reason that we are not given that chance.   Related: Hollywood sexism probe \u2018wide-ranging and well-resourced\u2019, says ACLU    It\u2019s a myth that this awful gender inequality in the film industry is because fewer women want to become directors. We don\u2019t want to be seeing a report in five years time with the same statistics. So my only hope is that people with the power in the UK film industry take a look and start thinking about what they can do to change this systematic bias.Carys Watford, writer/director, 28, London \u2018I didn\u2019t think things like that really happened in showbiz, until it did\u2019  This is nothing new. Culture is difficult to change. Part of the reason is that agents and producers will select writers with screenplays similar to films that have been proven to work before. These generally feature white, middle-class men, because they were written by white, middle-class men. Agents and producers are largely white, middle-class men, so they can relate to and empathise with stories about white, middle-class men. It\u2019s not about conscious sexism, it\u2019s about the fear of moving outside their comfort zone and taking a risk.  I once met the co-producer of a major franchise at the Cannes Film Festival, and he asked me to send him a CV for a job in production. We were at a beach party where networking, passion for film and fun collides: a couple of drinks later, he made a pass, which I rejected, and the job vanished into thin air. I didn\u2019t think things like that really happened in showbiz, until it did.  The strange thing is that I don\u2019t think badly of him. I think crossing a professional line like that wasn\u2019t problematic for him as a potential employer, but deeply problematic to me when I am trying to present myself as a respectful professional. It was misguided of him to not understand that, but I can understand why the job vanished. He probably felt embarrassed or foolish, which made me feel horrible, as I had genuinely clicked with him on a personal level. The bottom line was that I was ultimately there to find my next job though and didn\u2019t want to jeopardise that. I came away feeling that this would never have happened to a young guy with a CV and felt sad to have lost a great job opportunity over something so stupid.Jessica Benhamou, producer, 26",
