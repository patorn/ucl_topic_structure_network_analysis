  "body": "I\u2019ve been feeling rather cheerfully morbid lately (if such a thing is possible), perhaps because so many high-profile figures have been dropping dead at not far off my age, which is 60. I\u2019ve been briskly contemplating what it\u2019s going to be like for my children after I\u2019ve gone and what it is I should leave\u00a0them. I mean this in a largely material sense. What will be left to them psychologically, I can never know, and neither can they. It may be one form of damage or other, it may be something to bolster, support and inspire them. More probably it will be a mix of both, but, either way, I doubt there is very much I\u00a0can do about it now. I am wondering more about the detritus that one leaves behind \u2013 that is, deliberate bequests, as well as those that are more inadvertent, such as whatever residue is left on your computer or material written in diaries, or bits and pieces left lying\u00a0about in old tin boxes up in the\u00a0loft.   Related: What happens to my late husband\u2019s digital life now he\u2019s gone?    I am somewhat in the position of my father, who left me one plastic shopping bag with some old photographs, greetings cards and invitations, plus a battered fleece he was fond of. I\u00a0don\u2019t have much more. A\u00a0few paintings that might fetch a\u00a0couple of hundred quid at a push, the\u00a0odd first edition of a book that might achieve something above face value \u2013 but that\u2019s about it. Which brings me to diaries, tin boxes and computers. I have volumes and volumes of diaries, full of a mixture of banality, a little bit of insight, outbursts of frustration, and momentary, passing\u00a0passions that I unload on paper rather than blurt out loud. They are, I suppose, part of who I am, but not always a very attractive\u00a0part and no more \u201creal\u201d than any other part of me. Should I burn them all now in case I\u00a0drop dead, rather than get the notice we all assume we are going to receive before our demise? As with my diaries, there is all sorts of virtual detritus on my computer \u2013 God knows what sort of crap and personal notes I have written on it, plus years of texts and emails. None of\u00a0it is sordid, but some of it is personal and I would wish it to remain so. Should I arrange to have\u00a0the hard disk wiped in the event of my sudden death or is that an act of emotional and practical terrorism?   Related: A diary makes you happier and helps brain cope with emotional upsets, psychologists say    And what about my own mementoes \u2013 love letters from long-lost girlfriends, photographs, cards and other scraps, locks of hair perhaps, secreted in a small biscuit tin somewhere in the bowels of the house. Should they go on\u00a0the bonfire, too? Because they would make me cringe to look at them now, and I wouldn\u2019t want to bequeath my children that sort of embarrassment. Perhaps I should be thinking about creation rather than destruction. Should I even now, in the\u00a0pink of health, write each of my children a letter to be opened in the event of my death that would perhaps include, along with heartfelt expressions of love and\u00a0apology, homilies about wisdom,\u00a0virtue and truth. Doing so might be practical, but it feels a bit morbid. And\u00a0a little narcissistic. I think\u00a0I\u2019ll save\u00a0that for the final days \u2013 when I\u2019ve\u00a0had a bit longer to think about it. I am still working it out. Hopefully, I\u00a0will have plenty of time in which to\u00a0do so. In the meantime, I am happy\u00a0just to leave a memory and the\u00a0only other tangible (apart from my offspring themselves, of\u00a0course) evidence that I was ever here in the first place \u2013 my own novels,\u00a0which are more me, in some ways, than I will ever be. Or at least snapshots of people I once was \u2013 which\u00a0is all that any of us in the end can leave behind. @timlottwriter",
