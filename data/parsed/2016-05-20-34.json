  "body": "An operatic collaboration between an American film-maker, an Italian haute couture king, and a British set designer will make its debut this weekend. Sofia Coppola\u2019s La Traviata will open at the Opera of Rome on Sunday in a production featuring costumes made and designed by Valentino with backdrops created by Nathan Crowley, the set designer for the Batman films. Valentino, who sits on the opera house\u2019s board, approached the American director after seeing her 2006 film Marie Antoinette, which he said showed she possesses \u201ca distinctive sensitivity and musical aesthetic, balancing the classic and the modern\u201d. Coppola, who was nominated for a best director Oscar for Lost in Translation, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what to expect and I never could have had the courage to direct an opera, but then Valentino and Mr [Giancarlo] Giammetti [the designer\u2019s artistic collaborator] asked me.

Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex/Shutterstock    \u201cI thought what an incredible experience to be able to work in the Rome opera house with the beautiful costumes and the team here, so that motivated me to take a chance and do something that was scary and very unfamiliar.\u201d   Related: Sofia Coppola's La Traviata to set Opera of Rome back on song    The director, the daughter of the Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, said she drew on her Italian heritage for inspiration throughout the process. She said: \u201cMy great uncle has conducted La Traviata so he sat down and spoke to me a lot \u2013 I felt lucky to have this culture in my family.\u201d The star appeal of Coppola and Valentino has paid off for the beleaguered Rome opera house \u2013 long overshadowed by La Scala in Milan \u2013 which has made \u20ac1.2m (\u00a30.9m) in ticket sales already, making La Traviata the venue\u2019s highest grossing opera before the curtain has even risen. The opera house backers are hailing the ticket sales \u2013 the 15-night run has nearly sold out \u2013 as a sign that the Rome institution is emerging from a series of internal rows and financial crises.  Speaking to the New York Times, Coppola said she wanted to \u201cbring out the personal side of the French courtesan \u2013 the party girl used to the social scene. It\u2019s a very feminine world that I love.\u201d",
