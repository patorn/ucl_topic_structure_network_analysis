  "body": "I have a confession to make: I like the movie Top Gun. Since its release in 1986 it has been my guilty pleasure, one of those films I love to hate while hating the fact that I love it. Any time the movie pops up on TV I\u2019ll switch on the kettle and sink disgracefully into my sofa. As Top Gun celebrates its 30th anniversary this week, it\u2019s time to examine why this 80s classic, despite all its sins, rubs me up the right way.   Related: Tom Cruise will feel right at home in East Grinstead, Britain\u2019s strangest town | Sam Jordison    The story centres around an ill-disciplined but talented American fighter pilot nicknamed Maverick (Tom Cruise), who joins the elite Fighter Weapons school in California. Cocky with a flashy grin and stylish bomber jacket, Maverick takes us on a ride filled with skilful combat sequences and bromance, set against a pop art fantasy of sunsets and palm trees. This, and a kick-ass soundtrack, helped Top Gun gross more than $350m at the box office and boosted US Navy applications by 500%. But Top Gun also doubles as an unintentional comedy, thanks to some toe-curling male bonding. Its homoeroticism is the stuff of legend. We are treated to semi-naked locker room scenes in which Maverick\u2019s rival, Iceman (Val Kilmer), leans within kissing distance of him and says: \u201cI like you because you\u2019re dangerous,\u201d before snapping his teeth as if biting the proverbial pillow. Masculinity, Top Gun reminds us, is a horseshoe spectrum in which the gay and hyper-straight are not really so far apart.     Kelly McGillis and Tom Cruise: \u2018amazingly she agrees to go on a date with him\u2019. Photograph: Allstar/Paramount/Sportsphoto Ltd    Maverick takes this virility to ridiculous heights. First, we see him barging into the ladies\u2019 toilet to chat up his female flying instructor (Kelly McGillis) who, amazingly, agrees to go on a date with him. Having breezed through that transgression, Maverick plays topless volleyball on the beach until it is time for their rendezvous. The sweat hasn\u2019t even dried before he\u2019s putting on his T-shirt, rocking up at the instructor\u2019s house and asking to use her shower. Minutes later, he\u2019s at her dinner table \u2013 wearing the same sweat rags \u2013 and telling her: \u201cYou forgot the wine.\u201d If Maverick joined Tinder today he would be swiped off the left-hand side of the Earth. Luckily, naval school in 1986 was a good time to be a man, a place where Y chromosomes expressed themselves freely and dude-sweat stank as good as Chanel No 5. Our favourite pilot, even from his sky-high perspective, could not see the crisis of masculinity on the millennial horizon. Top Gun presses all my feminist buttons. It makes me want to throw things at the screen, yet I can\u2019t help but like it. Why? Being a minority on many fronts meant I rarely saw myself on screen in the 80s. Unable to identify with movie characters, I learned to distill storylines to their base essence. And the essence of Top Gun, the narrative it sells us, is simple and seductive. Maverick may be naughty but he is constantly rewarded for it. Flying too low past the control tower and pissing off his superiors? Here\u2019s an invite to the Top Gun school of aviation. Storming out of the classroom and rudely ignoring his instructor? Why not? Any man dressed in that bomber jacket can do what he damn well likes (even if he is wearing his granny\u2019s panties underneath, as we later discover). And if Maverick\u2019s instructor wants to chase him across town to give him an apology and a kiss then, goddamn it, let her \u2013 she owes him that. Sadly, Maverick is a fragile soul, haunted by the deaths of his classmate \u201cGoose\u201d and his pilot father. Still, he gets over his fears when it\u2019s time for combat. After a pep talk and some clench-jawed contemplation, Maverick straps up, shoots down the \u201cbogey\u201d planes and returns to a hero\u2019s welcome.

This is Ronald Reagan\u2019s America where the US Air Force kills the enemy through stylish aerial dogfights rather than dropping bombs on to family compounds from drones. Maverick\u2019s foes have no names, faces or backstories to trouble anyone\u2019s conscience, and victory comes swiftly. The joy of this simplicity is embedded in my childhood heart. If Top Gun came out today I wouldn\u2019t watch it \u2013 it is too bombastic, monochrome and sexist \u2013 but I\u2019ll let these things slide since I don\u2019t judge 1980s blockbusters by the same standards as post-9/11 ones. Top Gun gets a free pass for letting me relive the have-your-cake optimism of my youth. Watching it leaves me feeling so pumped I find myself doing the vacuum cleaning with a swagger afterwards. Very few movies have that effect, and for that I have to thank Maverick. Yes, he\u2019s a sexist tosser, but he can be my wingman any time.",
