  "body": "The parents of Elliott Johnson, the young political activist who is believed to have killed himself after allegedly being bullied by a Tory election aide, have said the inquest into his death is \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of a battle for justice for their son. Johnson, 21, was found on railway tracks on 15 September 2015 after leaving behind three letters, in one of which he alleged that former parliamentary candidate Mark Clarke had bullied him and political journalist Andre Walker had betrayed him. Both Clarke and Walker strongly deny the allegations. Ahead of the inquest into Elliott\u2019s death on Tuesday, his parents Ray and Alison Johnson said they hope the hearing will acknowledge the influence Clarke\u2019s alleged bullying had on their son\u2019s decision to end his life as they discussed the ongoing struggle with their grief. After the coroner refused in March to directly examine the bullying allegations, the couple are gearing up for a lengthier battle to bring to account those they hold responsible for Elliott\u2019s untimely death. Johnson, who will give a statement in person at the inquest, told the Guardian he is considering a range of legal options, including civil proceedings and private prosecution. Speaking from the family home in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, he said: \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned the coroner\u2019s legal process is the first legal process that we\u2019re going through. It\u2019s not the final process.  \u201cThere are other ways we can take this forward, there are still criminal proceedings, there are civil actions we can take and private prosecutions.  \u201cThere are a number of routes to go down, but we will wait until the coroner has spoken before we make any decisions.\u201d In a written ruling released in March, Tom Osborne, the senior coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton, said it was \u201cbeyond the proper scope\u201d of the inquest to call Tory party members to interrogate them over steps being taken to investigate bullying claims. Osborne refused to call Clarke and Walker to address the accusations publicly in a move questioned by the Johnson family. But he has agreed to investigate Elliott\u2019s dismissal from his role as political editor at the rightwing thinktank Conservative Way Forward (CWF) on 19 August last year, which the family believe is crucial. Elliott was sent a redundancy consultation letter which said that his role was at risk of redundancy on financial grounds. He was subsequently offered, and accepted, a paid part-time role as a social media consultant. The consultation letter makes direct reference to an altercation between Elliott and Clarke. Elliott complained to Conservative campaign headquarters about Clarke\u2019s behaviour after Clarke allegedly accosted him in the Marquis of Granby pub in Westminster. Shortly after, he was made redundant at CWF. CWF says it passed on Elliott\u2019s complaint to the headquarters and made sure other complaints about Clarke were also passed on. The letter starts: \u201cFurther to your email exchange with our HR consultant, I was asked to review our operational requirements to establish your ways to limit your exposure to an external individual following an incident you described which occurred on 12th August 2015. As part of the exercise I have identified that there is a diminishing need for a dedicated political editor for CWF and therefore it is with regret that I write to notify you that your role is at risk of redundancy.\u201d Johnson says he believes this establishes a direct link between Elliott\u2019s sacking and difficulties with Clarke. Conservative Way Forward has previously denied this. \u201cIt\u2019s not the coroner\u2019s duty to point the finger of blame, although they can allude to where they think the causes are and where some responsibilities lie,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hoping on Tuesday once he has given his verdict that he will make those allusions to where responsibilities lie for Elliott\u2019s death.  \u201cBecause clearly there are reasons for Elliott\u2019s death. He didn\u2019t just wake up one morning and decide he was going to kill himself on a railway line. \u201cAll of the evidence that we\u2019ve gleaned over the last eight months is that there are people and organisations involved in some way down the line, which caused him to do what he did.\u201d The semi-retired property developer said the quest for justice for his son had become a \u201cfull-time\u201d job.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused. God knows once this is over what we\u2019ll be like. We might revert to a bag of nerves.\u201d He describes his son as his \u201cbest friend\u201d but tries to remain strong for his daughters Charlotte and Hariette, who are both receiving professional counselling. Hariette, who has learning difficulties, is frequently found watching home videos of her late brother, he said.  \u201cI sometimes walk in and see her, you can\u2019t help but get tearful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do get upset, there are times when you really get upset, when you see things, or just relate to things with Elliott.\u201d Elliott\u2019s mother, Alison, adds: \u201cCharlotte has come home for summer now. You still find yourself waiting in the door for that final gathering of your family. That\u2019s what I find hard.\u201d She said the family have been unable to deal with Elliott\u2019s belongings, which were removed from his flat in Tooting, London by a relative and stored at the family home. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for us to go in there,\u201d she said. The Conservative party has appointed the law firm Clifford Chance to run an inquiry into the bullying allegations, but the Johnsons have declined to take part as they feel the inquiry will not be impartial.  Grant Shapps resigned as a minister in November after appointing Clarke as director of RoadTrip2015, a youth election campaign, when he was chair of the Tory party. On resigning, Shapps denied wrongdoing but said \u201cresponsibility should rest somewhere\u201d. His resignation came the day after the Guardian revealed Shapps had received a letter from Sayeeda Warsi complaining about Clarke\u2019s conduct in January 2015. The Tory party had up until that point claimed that it was first made aware of Clarke\u2019s alleged behaviour in August.  In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

An earlier version referred to a \u201cnotice of redundancy\u201d; it was a redundancy consultation letter. The article also said that the letter referred directly to the altercation between Elliott Johnson and Mark Clarke as being one of the reasons his employment was terminated. We accept that it did not make that statement. Sentences have been added to the article to make clear that the letter said Elliott\u2019s position was at risk of redundancy on financial grounds, that he subsequently accepted a paid part-time role, and that CWF passed on complaints about Mark Clarke from Elliott and others to Conservative campaign headquarters.",
