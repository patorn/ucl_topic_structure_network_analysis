Grace was in Durham to perform in protest against North Carolina\u2019s controversial \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, known commonly as HB2, which prevents transgender people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex. The passing of HB2 has prompted many stars, including Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr, to protest by cancelling previously scheduled shows in the state. North Carolina is also seeing some backlash from the entertainment industry \u2013 Lionsgate pulled production for a Hulu show that was supposed to be filmed in Charlotte.    I guess gender really is over since @LauraJaneGrace said goodbye to gender! #genderisover pic.twitter.com/EHXZJbMnM2\u2014 Kathryn (@kwymer6) May 16, 2016    Grace, who came out as transgender in 2012, wanted to protest about the law in a different way. \u201cI\u2019m going to create an event around the show as a form of protest to say that despite whatever stupid laws they enact, trans people are not going to be scared,\u201d she told BuzzFeed in April. \u201cThey are not going to go away.\u201d She also posted a photo of a toilet paper roll to Instagram depicting the bill \u201cas drafted\u201d by North Carolina\u2019s governor, Pat McCrory.       Other musicians want to approach protesting the law without cancelling their shows or events, as well. Moogfest, an electronic music and tech festival to take place in Durham, North Carolina, from 19-22 May, will continue, and the event will be reformed as a demonstration against the bill. Martine Rothblatt, a transgender woman and chief executive of United Therapeutics, a biotechnology company with an office outside Durham, will give the keynote address at the festival, and talk about the law, the role of robots in our future and why she thinks the US should provide free college education. \u201cI would rather be part of a protest festival than basically just be a silent voice walking away from it,\u201d Rothblatt, who founded Sirius Satellite Radio, told the New York Times. Cyndi Lauper is going ahead with her 4 June show in Raleigh, North Carolina, saying in a statement that she has \u201cseen time and time again what can happen when people join together to do what is fair\u201d. \u201cThe effort to repeal HB2 is the right and fair thing to do,\u201d she wrote. Lauper will donate all profits from the show to Equality North Carolina\u2019s efforts to repeal the bill. \u201cIf we truly want an inclusive society, we all have to include ourselves in the effort to make that happen,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is the best way I know how to include myself and urge you to join me in the best way you know how.\u201d Similarly, Mumford & Sons went ahead with their concert in Charlotte, North Carolina, in April. In a post on their Facebook page, the band said they felt compelled to take a stand on the issue, and would donate profits from their show to a local LGBTQ organization. \u201cAs always, we will open the doors to anyone who wants to come,\u201d they wrote. Singers like Jimmy Buffett and Gregg Allman also continued with their shows, slamming the bill on their websites, but performing out of a loyalty to their fans. \u201cNorth Carolina was there for me as a performer in the early days and I have always felt a loyalty to fans there that goes deep,\u201d Buffett wrote on his blog.  \u201cRightly so, a lot of people are reacting to the stupid law \u2026 These shows were booked and sold out long before the governor signed that stupid law. I am not going to let stupidity or bigotry trump fun for my loyal fans this year.\u201d",
