There weren\u2019t many women in parliament at the time, let alone working-class women. But I was inspired by the ferocious and glamorous Barbara Castle, Red Queen of Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour party, who is still one of my political heroines. She dominated political coverage when I was at my most impressionable. I thought she should be the first female prime minister, and have never quite forgiven Jim Callaghan for dispatching her from the cabinet. Whatever you think of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s politics \u2013 and it won\u2019t surprise you to hear I profoundly disagreed with almost everything she stood for \u2013 her election as the first female prime minister in 1979 was a remarkable achievement. When she entered No 10, she was one of just 19 female MPs, making up a pitiful and astonishing 3% of the House of Commons. The past 30 years have seen steady and significant progress in women\u2019s representation. When I was first elected to parliament in 1992, I was one of only 60 women out of 650. This doubled following Labour\u2019s victory in 1997 and has crept up to 191 today \u2013 10 times more than in Barbara Castle\u2019s heyday.

But the Tories have started to up their game, returning 68 female MPs at the last general election. There is a long way to go \u2013 particularly in the Tory party \u2013 but we are seeingprogress. This has undoubtedly had an impact on the way politics is conducted, both\u00a0in\u00a0the Commons and elsewhere. While sexism is alive and well \u2013 take David Cameron\u2019s instruction to me to \u201ccalm down dear\u201d during prime minister\u2019s questions in the last parliament, one of his least edifying moments. But some of the more blatant misogyny, the obscene gestures and insults that faced female MPs in previous years,\u00a0have\u00a0gone. However, there is a paradox. Looking at the coverage of the current referendum campaign, you would be forgiven for thinking that little had changed. It is overwhelmingly dominated by men. Cameron and George Osborne on one side; Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage on the other. It is coming across more like an Eton playground spat than a serious debate about the future of our\u00a0country. This week, Harriet Harman, Seema Malhotra, Kate Green and I held a press conference in an attempt to redress the balance \u2013 to highlight the missing voices of women and the importance of the vote on EU membership for women at work. Needless to say, much of the coverage focused on a question about a comment Harman made about Kim Kardashian. That\u00a0says it all, really. Women are not taken seriously. Even the language of election campaigns can be unmistakably masculine. The talk is all of civil war; of the big guns being rolled out; of the big beasts battling away. The problem is, all these beasts are blokes. The unwritten assumptions about what constitutes \u201cstrong leadership\u201d are male too. A study by Loughborough University released this week found that\u00a0just one in six politicians appearing on television to discuss the Europe question were women. In the press, it was one in 10. Of\u00a0the top 10 politicians covered, all were male. This is all sadly familiar. In a quarter of a century in politics, I\u2019ve seen it time, and time and time again. Even when women are in the top team, they rarely find themselves at the forefront of election campaigns. Even those inside the top team can end up feeling like outsiders \u2013 marginalised, disregarded\u00a0and invisible. Whatever progress women make, the pattern seems set. Whenever an election is called it\u2019s like a\u00a0trapdoor opens up beneath the chairs of every female politician and we simply\u00a0disappear from the scene. As\u00a0soon\u00a0as the campaign kicks off, our politics regresses to a bygone, men-only era. Take Harman. She was Labour\u2019s deputy leader in two elections but was never put at the forefront of an election campaign. Last year she ended up resorting to a pink bus to get her message across. Although this was, of course, much mocked by the chaps in the press, it was an effective way of connecting with women up and down the country. But it is sad that it was even felt to be necessary. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Just\u00a0look at Scotland, where the leaders of all three main parties are women, which is regarded as\u00a0an aberration by some. There are many talented and driven politicians on both sides of the house, and on both sides of the referendum debate. So what is going on? Do campaigns remain so male dominated because although the number of women politicians has increased, they haven\u2019t yet filtered through to the top jobs? In part, the answer is yes. In every one of the six\u00a0general elections in which I have been a candidate, the prime minister, chancellor, leader of the opposition and\u00a0shadow chancellor have all\u00a0been men. Or is it because the campaign teams that the political parties hire and put together are overwhelmingly male? Or is it because the newsrooms that make the editorial calls about whose speeches are reported are, equally, dominated by men? Or is it because of stubbornly persistent assumptions about women that still dominate in our society? Probably all of the above. The lack of women in high-profile roles at such crucial moments as the EU referendum campaign has consequences. I see disengagement among women \u2013 particularly among working-class women \u2013 everywhere I go.\u00a0In workplaces and at school gates across the country, women express a lack of interest in politics. Women have been\u00a0less likely\u00a0to vote than men in every general election since 1992, and now they say they are less likely to vote in the referendum. If women look at politics and don\u2019t see people like themselves, addressing the things that matter to them, then who can blame them for switching off? We politicians \u2013 and the media \u2013 are simply failing to include or address many women who are alienated by the insults and the shouting that have become such a feature of our adversarial political life. Now that Donald Trump \u2013 with his open disdain for women \u2013 has captured the Republican presidential nomination in the US, things may be about to go from bad to worse. However, on a positive note, the dominant political leader in Europe, Angela Merkel, is a woman. In in the UK we have Frances O\u2019Grady, the first female general secretary of the TUC, and the CBI too has a female director general, Carolyn Fairbairn. Vaira Vike-Freiberga has been nominated as the new head of the UN. And, of course, there is Hillary\u00a0Clinton. But it is absolutely vital too that we start taking female politicians in the UK\u00a0more seriously. Otherwise we risk alienating a large section of our electorate and undermining the foundations of our democracy. Women need to be seen and they need to be heard.",
