  "body": "The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has refused to rule out the Coalition forming minority government with independents, as poll analysis shows the government could lose up to 16 seats in just three states. Cormann was responding to comments by the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, about the Coalition\u2019s tactics in the event of a hung parliament. Malcolm Turnbull has added to the issue by saying a hung parliament was a \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d and if a minority government were formed it would be between Labor and the Greens. On ABC radio, Bishop said: \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to lose the election \u2013 I intend to be part of a government that can implement the economic plan we\u2019ve laid out so carefully for the Australian people.\u201d   Related: Australian election 2016: poll analysis suggests swing against Coalition \u2013 live    Asked about a possible hung parliament, Bishop said: \u201cWell ... this is all hypothetical. It would depend very much on the circumstances, it would depend on the legislation we were putting forward. \u201cThis is a double-dissolution election. As you know, when the Australian people make their decision ... we would then, on the assumption we were able to win the election, we would then go to a joint sitting of both houses of parliament to pass two very important economic and productivity enhancing measures.\u201d The legislation she was referring to was the restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and increasing accountability of union officials. Asked about Bishop\u2019s comments, Cormann told reporters the government was \u201cworking every single day to win the trust of the majority of people in the majority of seats\u201d. He did not rule out forming a minority government with independents and did not reject a characterisation that Bishop\u2019s comments meant the Coalition would consider doing so. \u201cWe are campaigning to win this election so that we can continue to implement our plan for jobs and growth,\u201d Cormann said. Asked about an analysis of Newspolls that showed the government might lose 16 seats in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, Cormann said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said this election will be close and what that means is that every single vote matters. \u201cEvery single Australian at this election has a very clear choice: a choice between our plan for jobs and growth ... or the alternative Labor approach, which would bring with it political instability, higher taxes, fewer jobs and weaker borders.\u201d   Related: Today's campaign: poll warning for Coalition after lacklustre debate    Cormann said Labor was \u201con a unity ticket with the Greens, on an anti-business, anti-success, anti-investment, anti-jobs and growth, weaker borders agenda\u201d. He said there was \u201cno prospect of the Coalition forming government with the Greens\u201d but repeatedly refused to rule out forming minority government with independents. The Greens have said forming government with the Coalition is \u201cinconceivable\u201d, citing its policies on climate change and refugees. Asked about minority government at a doorstop on Monday, Turnbull said \u201cthis is a theoretical possibility; the independents, you\u2019re basically talking about the Greens here, the Greens are a left wing political party, somewhat to the left of the Labor party\u201d. \u201cIf there is any government put together on that basis, we know from experience, we don\u2019t have to theorise, it will be done between Labor and the Greens,\u201d he said. There are three independent crossbench MPs seeking re-election: Cathy McGowan, Bob Katter and Andrew Wilkie. A number of other hopefuls have varying chances of success, including Tony Windsor, who is taking on the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, in New England and the former Australian Idol presenter James Mathison, who has announced he will run against Tony Abbott in Warringah. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, appeared on 2GB radio with Ray Hadley on Monday and was also asked to rule out a deal with independents for a Coalition minority government. Morrison replied: \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s a proposition that comes to us ... We have a majority in the House of Representatives at the moment, we intend to hold that majority. \u201cThe only real question about a hung parliament here is one that goes to Labor and the Greens, and we know what their form is on that and the form of independents previously ... That is the chaos we all remember. And the best way to avoid that chaos is to support the government.\u201d   Related: It's time to expose the myths of the neo-liberal economic model | Greg Jericho    Bishop was also asked about the possibility of a divided Senate.  \u201cWe know a Labor government would have to govern in coalition with the Greens; that\u2019s what we saw last time, that\u2019s what will happen next time,\u201d she said. \u201cI would look at every piece of legislation put forward by Labor and consider it on its merits.\u201d At a doorstop on Monday, Labor\u2019s campaign spokesman, Tony Burke, said he was \u201cunder no illusions\u201d about the difficulty of winning the election.  \u201cWhen you get more than a 20-seat head-start in an election campaign, that makes you automatically the frontrunner \u2013 that\u2019s where Malcolm Turnbull is,\u201d he said.  \u201cI know we are the underdogs in it but I also know that the fight here is close.\u201d",
