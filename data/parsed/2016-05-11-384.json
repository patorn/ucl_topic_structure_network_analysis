  "body": "More than $35,000 has been raised in less than 24 hours for the Q&A audience member whose question about tax polarised the panel but apparently united social media. Duncan Storrar, a 45-year-old father of two from Geelong, questioned the fairness of the government\u2019s tax cuts for those who earn more than $80,000 a year in the recent budget announcement. \u201cIf you lift my tax-free threshold, that changes my life. That means I get to say to my little girls, \u2018Daddy\u2019s not broke this weekend, we can go to the pictures\u2019. Rich people don\u2019t even notice their tax-free threshold lift. Why don\u2019t I get it? Why do they get it?\u201d Though panelist Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australia Industry Group, said Storrar would pay little tax, his point seemed to be underlined by assistant treasurer and minister for small business Kelly O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s passing reference to a $6,000 toaster. \u201cPeople just have no idea what it\u2019s like for people like me,\u201d he said after the program to Fairfax Media which hailed him as the \u201chuman face\u201d of the budget. \u201cWhat rich people call a milkshake and a sandwich \u2013 people at my end of the scale call that a meal for my family.\u201d #IStandWithDuncan was trending on Twitter for much of Tuesday afternoon as social media praised Storrar for his simple but polarising question.   Related: Q&A recap: questions about trickle-down economics open the floodgates    A GoFundMe page was set up by Braeside resident Samuel Fawcett to \u201cbuy Duncan Storrar a toaster\u201d with a target of $6,000 late on Tuesday. \u201cDuncan seems like a good bloke and every little bit of cash goes a long way. We reckon he deserves a bit of a helping hand so we\u2019ve decided to buy him a new toaster,\u201d the page reads. \u201c6 grand oughtta cover it. And if he has a little bit left over, maybe he can take his kids to the movies or something. Would you like to kick in a few dollars?\u201d Eighteen hours into its run, it had already raised more than $18,500 \u2013 by O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s assessment, enough for three toasters. Many of those who had chipped in thanked Storrar for being advocates for low-income earners. \u201cDuncan, this means nothing to me so I don\u2019t need it,\u201d wrote Douglas Wancia of his contribution of $50. \u201cI hope you can give your kids some enjoyment with it. You are the salt of the earth. Hard worker and doing your best. All the best mate.\u201d \u201cI grew up with a strong parent like you, buddy,\u201d wrote Lyndall da Silva. \u201cYour life is about to change. Hope we get to see more of you. The voice of real Australia.\u201d Fawcett wrote on the page that he hoped to get the money to Storrar by making contact with him through the media: \u201cI\u2019m sure we can find a way to assure you all while not impacting Duncan\u2019s privacy.\u201d Fawcett has been contacted by Guardian Australia for comment. Q&A series producer Amanda Collinge tweeted that \u201cthere\u2019s going viral, & then there\u2019s Duncan\u201d, and that people had emailed from as far away as London wanting to send him money for movie tickets.    Duncan has struck a chord. New national hero. pic.twitter.com/jrvKeBUD6p\u2014 Amanda Collinge (@amandacollinge) May 10, 2016    According to the Australian, Storrar survives on the $520-a-fortnight Austudy allowance, for which he qualifies for his study of youth work and mental health at a not-for-profit disability educator, supplemented by occasional work at $16 an hour as a truck driver. He was calling for an \u00adincrease in the $18,200 tax-free threshold so he could survive the weeks when his illness meant he worked fewer hours. The budget included a tax cut worth up to $6.04 a week for those earning between $80,000 and $180,000, starting on 1 July.",
