  "body": "China has refused to say whether a \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations with Britain still exists, after the Queen was caught on camera accusing Beijing officials of being rude. In a discussion with a senior Metropolitan police officer, the Queen was heard accusing unnamed Chinese representatives of being \u201cvery rude\u201d to the British ambassador in connection with President Xi Jinping\u2019s first state visit to Britain last year. The Queen was apparently unaware that the camera had picked up her comments to Metropolitan police commander Lucy D\u2019Orsi, filmed by a pool cameraman working on behalf of British broadcasters during a garden party at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. When D\u2019Orsi was introduced as the officer responsible for security during the visit, the Queen was heard to say: \u201cOh, bad luck.\u201d  D\u2019Orsi said it had been a \u201ctesting time\u201d and that officials had walked out of a meeting, saying the trip was off. \u201cThey were very rude to the ambassador,\u201d the Queen replied.

Photograph: AP    Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, declined to directly address the Queen\u2019s comments or confirm whether the \u201cgolden era\u201d \u2013 heralded when Xi visited Britain last year \u2013 was still alive.  \u201cPresident Xi\u2019s visit to the UK last year was a very successful one. Both sides have made great efforts for the success of the visit and the two sides highly recognised that,\u201d Lu said. Pressed by the Guardian to confirm whether the \u201cgolden era\u201d was still ongoing, Lu replied: \u201cBoth sides have expressed the hope that they would implement the outcomes of President Xi\u2019s visit and push forwards a steady and stable rise of the bilateral relationship. This requires the common efforts of both sides.\u201d Asked if that meant the special relationship was over, Lu said: \u201cYou can put my answers today together.\u201d When asked if he had been surprised by the Queen\u2019s comments, he laughed and said: \u201cI have already said what I can say.\u201d The Chinese state visit to Britain last year was so contentious and the policing of protest criticised to such an extent that Commander D\u2019Orsi publicly denied Scotland Yard had bowed to Chinese demands to restrict protest. It was not made clear what the flashpoint with Chinese officials was, but the most likely issue was protestors and how they would be handled and how close to the dignitaries of the Communist state they would be allowed to be. The three issues Scotland Yard was responsible for during the visit were security, the logistics of moving people around securely, and protest and public order \u2013 and it is the latter area which has been contentious in past Chinese state visits to the UK. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: \u201cThe Chinese state visit was extremely successful and all parties worked closely to ensure it proceeded smoothly.\u201d           Cameron caught boasting to Queen about \u2018fantastically corrupt\u2019 countries    Speaking in Gibraltar, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cBig state visits are big logistic challenges. I was involved in this and yes, it got a bit stressful on both sides.  \u201cBut it was a great state visit \u2013 everybody agrees, hugely successful \u2013 and our relationship with China is very strong and has been greatly strengthened by the success of that visit.\u201d A spokeswoman from the Chinese embassy in the UK made no direct mention of the Queen\u2019s comments, saying only: \u201cPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to the UK last year was very successful. Both sides at the working level made great efforts towards the success of the visit.\u201d China often suppresses foreign media reports that it regards as sensitive, and information about the Queen\u2019s remarks were difficult to find on the country\u2019s internet. The BBC said that its BBC World news channel was blacked out when it reported on the story. Michel Hockx, director of SOAS China Institute, told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme that some on Chinese social media believed the conversation was scripted \u2013 because the official introducing D\u2019Orsi to the Queen was reading from his notes. Hockx said: \u201cIt comes across as very sort of scripted and unnatural ... the fact that it was caught on camera and being put into the public domain \u2013 so some people are saying \u2018Well, this Queen turns out to be just another politician anyway\u2019.\u201d He added: \u201cOther people are saying, \u2018Well, we\u2019re always worried about our politicians not knowing how to behave in civilised countries like the UK, and this proves they still have a lot to learn\u2019.\u201d The Metropolitan police said they would not comment on the private conversation.  Earlier on Tuesday, the Queen was involved in another unguarded moment when the British prime minister was filmed telling her that Nigeria and Afghanistan were two of the most corrupt countries in the world. The leaders of both countries are attending an anti-corruption summit organised by David Cameron in London this week. Cameron was overheard telling the monarch that \u201cleaders of some fantastically corrupt countries\u201d would be attending the meeting, before singling out Nigeria and Afghanistan. Transcript Lord Chamberlain: Can I present Commander Lucy D\u2019Orsi, who was gold commander during the Chinese state visit. Queen: Oh, bad luck. Lord Chamberlain: And who was seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese, but she managed to hold her own and remain in command. And her mother, Judith, who\u2019s involved in child protection and social work. Judith Copson: Yes, I\u2019m very proud of my daughter. Lord Chamberlain: You must tell your story. D\u2019Orsi: Yes, I was the gold commander, so I\u2019m not sure whether you knew, but it was quite a testing time for me. Queen: Yes, I did. D\u2019Orsi: It was \u2026 I think at the point that they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off, that I felt \u2026 Queen: They were very rude to the ambassador. D\u2019Orsi: They were, well, yes she was, Barbara [Woodward, the ambassador] was with me and they walked out on both of us. Queen: Extraordinary. Copson: I know, it\u2019s unbelievable. D\u2019Orsi: It was very rude and very undiplomatic, I thought.",
