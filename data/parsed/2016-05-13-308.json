  "body": "It could be goodbye to McDonald\u2019s billboards, Pepsi posters and digital ads for Mars bars as the UK advertising watchdog launches a consultation on introducing tough new restrictions on marketing junk food to children. The Committee of Advertising Practice \u2013 the code-setting body for all advertising in the UK that appears in any media except on TV and radio \u2013 has launched a consultation to limit where ads promoting products high in fat, salt and sugar can appear in media including the press, posters, billboards, magazines and online. CAP is exploring specifically whether junk food ads should be banned from media targeted at \u2013 or of particular appeal to \u2013 children under the age of 12 or 16.   Related: MPs call for junk food ad ban during shows such as The X Factor    \u201cToo many children in the UK are growing up overweight or even obese, potentially damaging their health in later life and imposing a high cost on society,\u201d said James Best, chairman of CAP. \u201cAdvertising is just one small factor in a very complex equation but we believe we can play a positive part in addressing an urgent societal challenge. In proposing new rules, our aim is to strike the right balance between protecting children and enabling businesses to continue advertising their products responsibly.\u201d There is already a total ban on junk food TV advertising around all children\u2019s programming and all shows that have a 20% higher proportion of under 16-year-old viewers than the UK average.  CAP is also looking to relax rules that ban the use of licensed characters and celebrities popular with children in campaigns aimed directly at pre-school or primary school children. The new rules will ban them solely from being used to promote junk food, but open them up to being used to advertise healthier foods to children. \u201cAvailable evidence shows that advertising has a modest effect on children\u2019s food preferences, but other factors like parental influence, opportunities for physical exercise, education etc, play greater roles in the causes of \u2013 and solutions to \u2013 childhood obesity,\u201d said CAP. \u201cHowever, CAP believes even a relatively small positive impact from new advertising restrictions could make a meaningful contribution to tackling this important health issue.\u201d CAP initially announced its intention to launch a consultation on whether to begin the process of looking to introduce some form of restrictions on junk food ads in non-broadcast media last September.",
