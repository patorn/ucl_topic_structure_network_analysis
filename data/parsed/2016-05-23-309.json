  "body": "I was living in a wooden house in Bulli when the copy of Voiceworks arrived in the mail. Young, living cheap with my boyfriend in the Wollongong \u2018burbs, the arrival of that magazine was as transformative to belief in my own prospects as the appearance of an owl with a Hogwarts letter. Thanks to an editorial collective in far away Melbourne, I held a printed, cardboard validation in my hands that, yes, maybe even I could be a writer.  In the lives of all artists, it\u2019s these moments of engagement with the structures of artistic progress that are not only the most memorable but the most crucial. The events of this week have forced a similar recognition in the Australian arts community. The sector is reeling from \u201cBlack Friday\u201d \u2013 the day last week when the Turnbull government cuts to the arts finally swung as an axe and felled funding to 62 formerly funded companies. Express Media, the publishers of Voiceworks, was one of those hit.    Related: The 70% drop in Australia Council grants for individual artists is staggering | Alison Croggon    Tony Abbott was still prime minister when the 2015 budget announced the removal of more than $100m from the scarce funds of the Australia Council to be relocated to a \u201cNational Programme for Excellence in the Arts\u201d, funds allocated by ministerial discretion rather than a process of independent peer assessment. The initiator, George Brandis, was toppled in the Turnbull ascension and replaced with Mitch Fifield but all the cut money was not replaced to the Australia Council. Fifield renamed the NPEA \u201cCatalyst\u201d and the damage was rebranded as well as it was done. The popular RRR arts broadcaster Richard Watts, also the performing arts editor of the industry magazine ArtsHub, was the artistic director of Express Media from 2000 to 2005. He\u2019s one of many reacting to the cuts with rage, given consideration of their impact seems to be an issue of zero policy concern to the government that forced them.  \u201cExpress Media is the most vital organisation for the development of emerging Australian writers,\u201d Watts says. \u201cNo one manages the level of critical development and mentorship that it does. To defund it is a criminal act that will damage the future of literature in Australia.\u201d  He names celebrated writers Anna Krien, Benjamin Law, Tom Doig and Romy Ash as just a handful whose work was developed while he was there. Georgie Meagher, the artistic director of the multidisciplinary and experimental Next Wave festival, which has also been defunded, names the visual artist Patricia Piccinini, the actor/writer Deborah Mailman, the singer Kate Ceberano, the performer Lauren Brincat and celebrated companies such as The Suitcase Royale, Post and Brown Council as those that have been nurtured and encouraged in Next Wave\u2019s ranks. Meagher learnt of the defunding in the middle of the festival itself last week.  \u201cWe are trying not to feel demoralised because we\u2019re in the middle of a wildly successful festival that\u2019s smashing our box office and attendance records,\u201d she tells me.  Next Wave at least has enough support from the City of Melbourne and Creative Victoria to continue, \u201cbut the support we\u2019re going to provide to artists will be severely diminished and our organisation will be forced to shrink. Jobs will be lost.\u201d   Related: Australia Council cuts: theatre companies lament \u2018dark days\u2019 for arts    The waste of time invested in making both jobs and artistic practice sustainable is what has provoked \u201canxiety and confusion\u201d in the likes of Kate Champion, the former artistic director of dance theatre company Force Majeure. Champion built the innovative company from scratch and, after over a decade of collaborations with companies such as Belvoir and the Sydney Theatre Company, extensive international touring and time on the festival circuit, she spent three years smoothing the transition of the company to a new artistic director.  Champion left last June but now Force Majeure has also lost its funding. It took Champion 11 years to get the company to the \u201ckey organisation\u201d status that\u2019s just been taken away.  \u201cWhat it would have meant to me to walk into an established infrastructure and a company that was stable would have enabled me to get some much done,\u201d she says of the opportunity denied to her successor. \u201cAll of that care and work just dissolves in a decision like that. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d Despite the government\u2019s once expressed desire for \u201cheritage arts\u201d, not even the historical importance \u2013 or current star power \u2013 of literary journal Meanjin has been enough to spare it from decimation. The well known ABC broadcaster Jonathan Green is the current editor of a publication that he describes as the \u201cWho\u2019s That of Australian writing\u201d. Publishing essays, cultural criticism, prose and poetry, Meanjin has run key cultural discussions since its first publication in 1940. \u201cIt\u2019s unashamedly of and about Australian writing and ideas,\u201d says Green, \u201cbut something like Meanjin is never going to be a commercial success.\u201d Green insists \u201chope springs eternal\u201d but is aware that while two part-time employees are sufficient to put the magazine together and to run an archival website, it doesn\u2019t leave a lot of time for the energy required for fundraising, which is a \u201ctiring pursuit\u201d. The lesson learnt by Green amid the cuts is that \u201cif your funding is too narrowly sourced, you\u2019re vulnerable to this kind of shock. We must diversify.\u201d   Related: Literary magazine Meanjin may close after losing Australia Council funding    But where, how and to whom these companies can diversify may be a bitter contest. Labor\u2019s arts spokesman, Mark Dreyfus, has promised full restoration of funding to the Australia Council but, should the Turnbull government be re-elected, there will be much competition in a very shallow philanthropic pool. \u201cPhilanthropy is already so competitive and these cuts are going to make it tricky for us not to compete against each other,\u201d says Meagher. \u201cWe\u2019re in a state of desperation.\u201d It\u2019s difficult not to share the sentiment. I see myself as the young woman in Bulli, holding a magazine and new confidence in an old dream in front of me, and wonder just how many young artists will disappear as companies, and the crucial opportunities they provide, struggle and vanish. The reactions are emotional but the reality is political. It\u2019s Meagher again who perhaps best summarises how everyone in the sector is feeling. \u201cWe all had this little glimmer of hope when Turnbull got in,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018He likes art! He\u2019s got a collection! He owns a Bill Henson! We\u2019ll be OK!\u2019 And it\u2019s not.\u201d",
