The acclaimed natural history broadcaster said last year\u2019s funding deal in which the BBC took on the \u00a3700m-plus cost of free licence fees for the over-75s was \u201cterrible\u201d. Attenborough spoke out ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday 8 May \u2013 to be marked by a special season of programmes across the BBC \u2013 and days before the government is expected to publish its white paper on the future of the corporation. Over the weekend, the government was forced to deny reports that it was seeking to influence BBC scheduling so that popular shows such as Strictly Come Dancing would not be screened at the same time as big programmes on rival channels. The shadow culture secretary, Maria Eagle, said: \u201cJohn Whittingdale [the culture secretary] is behaving as if he were running the BBC \u2013 he is not. This kind of meddling in day-to-day scheduling decisions would be a completely unacceptable interference in the independence of the BBC.\u201d Attenborough told the Guardian: \u201cThere is plenty that viewers can do. Politicians don\u2019t wish to be the people who are branded as getting rid of the BBC. They know that the BBC holds a very precious place in a large proportion of voters\u2019 minds and they can\u2019t play fast and loose with it as they would wish. \u201cWhen I saw what the [funding] deal was I thought, that\u2019s terrible, that\u2019s a distortion. What the BBC will say, and I daresay they are right, is the alternative was something worse.\u201d He added: \u201cThe basic principle of public service broadcasting is profoundly important. If we lose that we really lose a very valuable thing, you are throwing away one of the most precious things that we have.\u201d The BBC negotiated a number of conditions in last year\u2019s pre-budget deal, including an inflation-linked rise in the licence fee, but doubts remain over its future funding, with its size and scale far from certain. Attenborough has previously warned that the BBC was in \u201creal danger\u201d from cuts and online rivals such as Netflix.  \u201cOf course the BBC has got to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole [of broadcasting] has changed beyond recognition. When I joined the BBC it was like a civil service, a monopoly, and there\u2019s no comparison to what it is now.\u201d Reports of his impending retirement have once again proved premature, with Attenborough recently returned from a ballooning trip 11,000 feet above the Alps to film for a sequel to his landmark 2006 series Planet Earth.

It\u2019s a good series, I think.\u201d It will also reflect the issue of climate change, he added. In a recent Guardian interview Attenborough said he didn\u2019t have a \u201crosy view of life, of the future\u201d.

It\u2019s really a tiny technological problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re proposing a route map in which you look at where the congestions are, as it were, and getting international organisations to look and say, \u2018I\u2019ll tackle this, you tackle that\u2019, and within 10 years we\u2019ll be able to produce the whole thing and bingo.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Attenborough season includes a special 60-minute programme, Attenborough at 90, on his birthday, four documentaries spanning his career and one of his first programmes, Zoo Quest, shown in colour for the first time.     90 years in 60 seconds   Zoo Quest features extraordinary footage including Attenborough chasing an anteater and wrestling, shirtless, with a baby crocodile. \u201cThey said do your best, dear boy, and we\u2019ll see you at Christmas,\u201d Attenborough remembered of the series which began in 1954; the first six shows made for a budget of \u00a31,000. More than 60 years later he is still making programmes, with his latest, Life that Glows, about the magical light made by glow worms, fire flies and luminous plankton, to be broadcast on BBC2 on 9 May. On the prospect of turning 90, Attenborough said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it, really. The only conclusion you can have is that by God, you are lucky. \u201cWhen you think, I have relatives and friends who are 90 and they can\u2019t remember what day it is and they can\u2019t walk \u2013 this is not Christian virtue, just luck.\u201d Attenborough at 90 is on BBC1 at 7pm on 8 May",
