  "body": "Donald Trump has called for the elimination of the federal minimum wage, as he retreated from primary promises and once again refused to release his tax returns because of \u201ca link\u201d to an audit.   Related: I don't need Republican unity to win, says new Republican party leader    The presumptive Republican nominee for president repeatedly said he would support a higher minimum wage, a reversal from his position when he had conservative opponents. But he insisted on Sunday that states should decide such wages. \u201cI like the idea of \u2018let the states decide\u2019,\u201d Trump told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cBut I think people should get more. I think they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re working. It is a very low number.\u201d Asked \u201cshould the federal government set a floor\u201d \u2013 a national minimum wage \u2013 Trump replied: \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. \u201cAnd the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other.\u201d In a November debate, the businessman, who claims his net worth is worth more than $10bn, said: \u201cTaxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world.\u201d He then told Fox News: \u201cWe were talking about the minimum wage, and they said \u2018Should we increase the minimum wage?\u2019 And I\u2019m saying that if we\u2019re going to compete with other countries we can\u2019t do that because the wages would be too high.\u201d But on Sunday he expressed sympathy for people who struggle to survive on the current federal minimum wage.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how you live on $7.25 an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would say: let the states decide.\u201d Similarly, he told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cI haven\u2019t decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more.\u201d   trump   Trump readily admitted that he had given up his previous position. \u201cSure, it\u2019s a change,\u201d he said, framing his willingness to abandon one position as a negotiation tactic. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to change. You need flexibility. But my real minimum wage is going to be I\u2019m going to bring companies back into this country, and [people are] going to make a lot more than the $15, even.\u201d Looking toward a general election against Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive favorite to be the Democratic nominee, Trump similarly retreated from tax proposals that would benefit the most wealthy Americans and heavily tax the poor. On Sunday, he said he intended to tax the wealthy. \u201cFor the wealthy, I think, frankly, it\u2019s going to go up,\u201d he said, saying he would likely pay more taxes himself. \u201cWhen it comes time to negotiate, I feel less concerned with the rich than I do with the middle class.\u201d But Trump was unwilling to discuss taxes he has already paid. He again refused to release his tax returns, citing an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit into some of them and \u201ca link\u201d between audited returns and returns not being investigated.  No law exists that forbids the release of tax returns under audit. The IRS has stated: \u201cNothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information.\u201d \u201cI have very big tax returns,\u201d Trump said on Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely complex.\u201d He said he hoped to release the returns before the general election, but would not pledge to do so.    tkt   \u201cI\u2019ll do it as fast as the auditors finish,\u201d he said.   Related: How Trump\u2019s $50m golf club became $1.4m when it came time to pay tax    The former reality TV star insisted that \u201cyou don\u2019t learn much from tax returns\u201d and that his \u201cfinancials\u201d show a value of more than $10bn. His financial filings with federal officials, however, do not always correspond with other declarations of his worth.  For instance, in a financial disclosure made when he announced his run for the White House last year, Trump listed a New York state golf club at $50m. But in a lawsuit, as part of his argument that he should pay 90% less tax on the property, he told a judge the same club was worth only $1.4m. Trump also shares an address with Hillary Clinton and more than 285,000 companies in Delaware, at a building that has become famous for helping businesses avoid taxes through the so-called \u201cDelaware loophole\u201d. Presidential candidates have traditionally released tax returns to the public, though sometimes with great reluctance. The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, worth an estimated $250m, eventually released two years of returns. He has since become one of Trump\u2019s most prominent adversaries, suggesting in February that Trump is hiding \u201ca bombshell\u201d in his returns. \u201cEither he\u2019s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is or he hasn\u2019t been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay,\u201d Romney said.  \u201cOr perhaps he hasn\u2019t been giving money to the vets or to the disabled like he\u2019s been telling us he\u2019s doing.\u201d",
