  "body": "If the latest issue of Hello! magazine is anything to go by (let\u2019s be honest, it usually isn\u2019t), ostentatious displays of wealth are, following a timely hiatus, very much back. The super-rich went quiet there, for a bit, in the wake of the global financial crisis, but now, according to Tamara Ecclestone\u2019s latest display in that venerable publication\u2019s pages, we plebs can rejoice in the return of the Paris Hilton ethos, which can be adequately summed up: \u201cSuck it, peasants.\u201d So you can take the old adage that money talks and wealth whispers, and tear it up, because Ecclestone is crowing. Showing off her two-year-old daughter\u2019s palatial playhouse \u2013 an exact replica of Ecclestone\u2019s 57-room \u00a370m Kensington mansion \u2013 in the midst of a horrific housing crisis can only suggest one of two things: ignorance or indifference, and neither are especially gratifying to those who, for a brief moment, will have taken succour in London\u2019s rejection of a Tory billionaire for mayor in favour of the son of a bus driver committed to building more homes.   Related: Former garage in south-west London fetches \u00a3466,000 at auction    Of course, those who dare to criticise the billionaire class are likely to be accused of practising the politics of envy, which is why I\u2019d like to state categorically here that, as a woman in her twenties, there is very little use I could personally get out of a 10-grand playhouse. I suppose I could use it to house all the cats men\u2019s rights activists are convinced that every vocal feminist must have, or, once I hit 30, I could heed the tabloid media and use it as a temple to my biological clock and sexual allure. I could even rent it out to some refugee children. But I could not live in it. Still, at this time of rampant social inequality, such ostentatious displays of more money than sense are prone to make even the least acquisitive of humans reflect a bit. Ten grand. What would you spend it on? I\u2019d help my mum out with a dispute she\u2019s having with social services, and take my autistic brother on holiday to the seaside. No doubt many of you have debts you\u2019d pay off or children to get through apprenticeships and college, or elderly parents whose care needs financing, or a house you\u2019d like to buy but can\u2019t \u2013 you know, the stuff of life. Is it the politics of envy to point this out? Probably, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m sick to the back teeth of seeing the denigration of those righteously angry at how the world\u2019s richest 62 people are as wealthy as half the world\u2019s population. It\u2019s as though the rich are some kind of superhuman class. In fact, we are all made of the same blood and bone and muscle, and all merit a share of the safe, comfortable lives this planet is perfectly capable of offering us.     The Hello! issue featuring Ecclestone\u2019s daughter\u2019s playhouse. Photograph: Hello! Magazine/PA    Which is why I\u2019m glad, in a way, that wealth flaunting is back. It\u2019s been bubbling for a while now, what with Rich Kids of Instagram and the Kardashians and Made in Chelsea, and the Real Housewives of Bloody Narnia or Westeros or Wherever. We\u2019ve just seen the Sunday Times Rich List crop up again with all the sad inevitability of a yeast infection, and it tells us that property tycoons are doing brilliantly. In a weekend supplement, I read that Kazakh oil billionaire Goga Ashkenazi \u201conce accidentally bid \u00a3240,000 on a painting when she was waving at J-Lo at an auction\u201d. Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, slum landlords are being taken to court for cramming people into houses not suitable for multiple occupancy, some of the country\u2019s 11 million private renters have been sharing their appalling housing conditions via #ventyourrent, there\u2019s a homelessness crisis in Manchester, property websites advertise mezzanines and cupboards for frankly absurd prices and people are literally living and dying in sheds. As a garage in south-west London fetches \u00a3466,000, the windows of unoccupied piggy-bank Mayfair townhouses stay dark and the wealthy squirrel away their money offshore, more than a million people in the UK are living in destitution. In this context, if someone like Ecclestone wants to come along and show off a garish, overpriced Wendy house then I am all for it. Please, for the love of God Tamara, do not check your privilege. There are no doubt those out there who genuinely hate the rich, providing ample fodder for public-school educated actors to complain about posh-bashing in our newspaper supplements. I am not one of those people. No one is responsible for the circumstances into which they were born, whether privilege or poverty. But what you do with that privilege, whether you manage it with generosity, and humility, and grace, is crucial. I\u2019m all for the politics of envy when it\u2019s channelled into positive social change. Those who criticise its use as a tactic when applied to rich people are frequently those who will happily deploy it when it comes to peeking over their neighbour\u2019s fence in an attempt to work out how much help they receive from the state. So I\u2019m happy for the billionaires to keep on crowing. It might not be on a par with \u201clet them eat cake\u201d, but people do notice, and, if we\u2019re lucky, they might feel compelled to do something about it.",
