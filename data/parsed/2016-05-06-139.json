  "body": "The elections have seen the remarkable transformation of Ruth Davidson\u2019s Scottish Conservatives from \u201ctoxic Tories\u201d to the second party and official opposition of the Holyrood parliament. The party nearly doubled the number of seats it won in 2011, to 31, while the benighted Scottish Labour party slipped back into third place with 24 seats, only three of which were won in first-past-the-post constituency contests. How Scotland\u2019s political geography changed, seat by seat   Change in % vote share for main political parties in Scotland 2011-16 (roll over individual constituencies for details). Change in % vote share for main political parties in Scotland 2011-16   It was Davidson who, having baited Labour\u2019s Kezia Dugdale over her pro-union credentials during the televised leaders\u2019 debates, successfully positioned herself as the only person capable of standing up to Nicola Sturgeon over independence.  Does this mean that the constitutional question is once again front and centre of Scottish politics, as voters split according to yes/no loyalties, just as they did in last year\u2019s Westminster elections? Not necessarily. During the campaign, Conservative activists told the Guardian that the constitutional question was not having as much sway on the doorstep as their message of strong opposition to the dominant SNP.  Davidson\u2019s personal popularity also proved a decisive factor: campaigners made no secret of introducing themselves as being \u201cwith Team Ruth\u201d rather than representing the Scottish Conservatives. The strongest evidence for this was the leader\u2019s own unexpected win of Edinburgh Central from the SNP, a constituency she barely campaigned in after switching her political base from Glasgow last summer. In Edinburgh, voting resulted in a political merry-go-round   Change in % vote share for main political parties in Edinburgh   Perhaps more significant was the distribution of the pro-independence vote: while the SNP victory was substantial, the party lost six seats and failed to secure an overall majority, while the Greens consolidated their post-referendum surge in support by tripling their tally to six list seats, leapfrogging the Liberal Democrats into fourth place in the process. This would suggest that, with their second list vote, independence supporters were attracted to the Greens\u2019 more radical offer to \u201cpush the SNP beyond their comfort zone\u201d on tax, fracking and land reform.  What was starkly evident in some constituencies, particularly across the central belt, was how percentages of Conservative gains were matched almost exactly by Labour losses, although Davidson did tell the Guardian earlier this week that she was targeting older, working-class Labour voters \u201cwho look at Jeremy Corbyn and run a mile\u201d.  Of all Labour\u2019s losses, the central belt was hit hardest   Change in % vote share in seats where Labour lost   But it\u2019s highly unlikely that this indicates a sizeable tranche of direct switchers. Rather, it indicates a Labour base without a strong enough motivation to get out and vote, while the Conservative base felt the opposite: that there was a point to voting again and they were well-mobilised. Mark Diffley, a pollster with Ipsos Mori Scotland, said Davidson had run a tactically brilliant campaign. \u201cShe is a young charismatic leader who reaches out beyond the traditional Tory constituency and also played the aftermath of the referendum pretty astutely, it has to be said,\u201d he said.  Diffley said Davidson told voters: \u201cIf you want to protect yourself against another referendum, vote Tory. And they were pretty consistent about that during the campaign.\u201d In Aberdeen, the SNP held its majority but Labour sank to third as the Tories gained four seats   Change in % vote share for main political parties in Aberdeen   Senior figures in the Scottish Labour party and trade unions believe their poor showing, which led to Labour\u2019s worst result in more than a century, was in part because it had failed to address the country\u2019s constitutional future. Alex Rowley, Labour\u2019s deputy leader at Holyrood, said the party had to win back former Labour voters who had shifted their support to the SNP after voting for independence in 2014 by producing \u201ca clear vision for the future of Scotland\u201d.  Glasgow is now all yellow after Labour failed to hold the three constituencies it had in 2011   Change in % vote share for main political parties in Glasgow   Labour needed to revisit the question of \u201chome rule\u201d for Scotland, or federalism at UK level, under which Holyrood would have control over far more tax-raising areas, such as pensions or employment law.  \u201cWe will need to set out what kind of future we want for Scotland,\u201d Rowley said.",
