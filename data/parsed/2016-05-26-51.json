  "body": "The leader of the NHS\u2019s junior doctors has asked them to stop \u201cscaremongering\u201d and posting \u201cabusive\u201d messages about their new contract as they prepare to accept or reject the proposals. Dr Johann Malawana, chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s junior doctors committee, has issued a series of pleas to trainee medics to try and defuse anger and opposition among them to the revised terms and conditions.  He sought to rebut sometimes vociferous criticisms on key issues and insisted that the deal struck with Jeremy Hunt last week is \u201cthe absolute best deal I think possible\u201d and should be backed.  BMA sources say that it is \u201c50/50\u201d and \u201ctoo close to call\u201d how the vote by England\u2019s 55,000 doctors next month will go.    Related: Junior doctors split over deal with Jeremy Hunt to end contract dispute    Malawana has also decried the sometimes strong personal abuse he has suffered on the junior doctors\u2019 Facebook discussion forum where they privately debate the bitter contract dispute.  In messages he has posted there since the potential settlement was announced on 18 May he has also hinted strongly several times that he will resign if junior doctors reject the compromise in their ballot on it, which starts on 17 June and closes on 1 July, with the result by 6 July.  In one post he said: \u201cI am not at all clear how some people\u2019s posts are balanced as they are not based in fact and are simply scaremongering and abusive as far as I can see. I am not sure how not waiting to actually understand the detail is really the basis to simply throw all your toys out of the pram and start abusing people really works.\u201d  Malawana has also condemned \u201cpeople that are trying to hijack the legitimate concerns of a group of employees and use that groundswell to prove political points. The vast majority of doctors I have talked to though don\u2019t want to have this dispute hijacked for political reasons and want the focus to be on getting the best deal for members\u201d.    Related: 'There is still deep anger': junior doctors on the new contract deal | Sarah Marsh    The BMA and NHS Employers are finalising the detail of the terms and conditions resulting from the new deal, which will be published by next Tuesday at the latest. The doctors\u2019 union is bracing itself for the document kickstarting a renewed intense debate about whether the agreement represents a good deal for doctors.  But sceptical junior doctors are using the forum to voice serious concerns about pay, weekend working, patient safety and the risk of working even longer hours. Some accuse Malawana of abandoning some of the BMA\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d during the nine month-long dispute, especially its refusal to allow Saturday to become part of a junior doctor\u2019s normal working week.  \u201cJohann you\u2019ve allowed negotiations to continue on the notion of facilitating a seven-day service without challenging the fact this is 1) not required 2) not modelled 3) not possible given current rota gaps and 4) not safe since the number of doctors isn\u2019t increasing\u201d, said Dr Shaun Quigley, a junior doctor on the forum.  Another, Aislinn Macklin-Doherty, said: \u201cYou must vote no to this contract offer.\u201d Junior doctors should not allow Hunt to try and introduce a more fully seven-day NHS without boosting the service\u2019s budget, she said. \u201cThe problem is they are attempting to do this for free. This is what the cost-neutral part of this contract is and that is why our terms can never be better under this contract\u201d, she wrote.  \u201cWeekend work is now normal work. I thought that was one of our red lines as well. Replaced by pay by frequency which was also in the imposed contract. I am truly disappointed with this\u201d said another doctor, Atif Khan.  Dr Ben White, a member of Justice For Health, which has begun legal action challenging the health secretary\u2019s right to impose the contract, has aired a series of concerns of the role of the new guardians of doctors\u2019 working hours, which all NHS trusts have to introduce. The guardians will not be independent of the trusts where they will be highlighting shortages of doctors, he pointed out.    Related: BMA considered dragging out doctors' dispute, emails show    The BMA hopes to persuade junior doctors to endorse the deal through a long document that explains what its terms and conditions will mean in practice. It will include detailed financial modelling so that trainees \u2013 all medics below the level of consultant \u2013 can work out if they will be better or worse off in future.  It will also undertake a series of roadshows around England to try and boost the chances of a \u201cyes\u201d vote.  Laura Lefley, GP in Brighton, wrote on the forum: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at it. I\u2019m a GP, but if I was still in training I wouldn\u2019t sign it. It\u2019s crap for women. How can they provide extra funds for us to catch up with training after maternity leave?? We can\u2019t work any faster. We don\u2019t want extra funding for training, we want equal pay.\u201d Meanwhile, leaked emails show that the BMA considered dragging out the junior doctors\u2019 dispute for up to 18 months in order to tie Hunt\u2019s department \u201cin knots\u201d and force him to impose the contract that medics loathed. A cache of messages exchanged between leaders of the union\u2019s junior doctors committee (JDC) also show that it discussed BMA members going on strike repeatedly over a \u201cprolonged period\u201d.   Related: Junior doctors' contract deal: what was agreed    Junior doctors in England have taken industrial action on eight days since January as part of a campaign of protest against new terms and conditions that the health secretary threatened to impose on them.  Messages exchanged between the 12-strong executive of the JDC via WhatsApp starting last November have been obtained and published on Thursday by the Health Service Journal. They show that for many months the JDC was adamantly opposed to discussing Saturdays becoming part of a junior doctor\u2019s normal working week \u2013 that was their \u201conly real red line\u201d in the bitter dispute \u2013 until finally changing their mind earlier this month.",
