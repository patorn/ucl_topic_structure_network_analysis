  "body": "Bernie, a 130-pound Swiss mountain dog, began having grand mal seizures when he was six months old. About once a week he would violently convulse, foam at the mouth, and urinate on himself for several minutes before recovering an or so hour later. The medication he was given seriously disoriented him, was harmful to his liver and for the most part didn\u2019t work.  At the end of their rope, Bernie\u2019s parents decided to put him on a pet supplement derived from cannabis. Gradually, his seizures became less severe and less frequent, before disappearing altogether.  Despite a large amount of promising anecdotal evidence like Bernie\u2019s story, and a growing industry of cannabis-based pet products, many people have a hard time taking medical marijuana for pets seriously.  \u201cIt sounds ridiculous, until you experience it yourself,\u201d said Bernie\u2019s owner, Anthony Georgiadis, who says his dog hasn\u2019t had a seizure in four months. Living in Florida, where medical marijuana is illegal, Georgiadis orders Bernie\u2019s supplement online from a California company called Treatibles. He is allowed to do this because Treatibles products are derived from legal hemp and contain little to no THC (the intoxicating ingredient in marijuana). Many pet products are not made from hemp, though, but rather straight marijuana containing trace amounts of THC. So anyone wanting these products for their animal\u2019s chronic pain, anxiety, inflammation, appetite stimulation, or epilepsy have to live in a state where medical marijuana is legal \u2013 and even then, they need to have a prescription for themselves just to enter a dispensary. Last year, Tick Segerblom, a Nevada state senator, introduced a bill to create a medical marijuana registry for pets.    Related: Utah hears of danger of dope-crazed rabbits if marijuana legalised    \u201cThey thought it was a joke,\u201d Segerblom said of his senate colleagues. \u201cIt was the talk of the country for a while.\u201d  \u201cLook at this moron!\u201d Dennis Miller screamed on the O\u2019Reilly Factor, deriding the senator\u2019s bill, calling it \u201cthe end of culture as we know it\u201d. \u201cI have fish at home that want medical marijuana,\u201d O\u2019Reilly joked. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure how to deliver that to them, because if you put the cigarette in there it all gets wet.\u201d  Despite the public ridicule, Segerblom said, he had been looking forward to the issue being debated in a hearing, but that hearing never happened. In the end, he said, \u201cit went to a committee headed by a person who hates marijuana, and he made sure that it died\u201d. Amanda Reiman, manager of marijuana law at the Drug Policy Alliance, said that today\u2019s battle over animal medical marijuana mirrors the clash over human medical marijuana in 1990s California.  \u201cWhen we first started talking about the idea of using marijuana as a medicine, people laughed about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve come around, because when you know someone who was helped by cannabis it\u2019s not funny anymore.\u201d In 2013, Reiman\u2019s cat, Monkey, was diagnosed with terminal intestinal cancer. The chemotherapy and medication caused Monkey to lose her appetite, not sleep and become lethargic. The situation reminded Reiman of the countless scenarios she\u2019d encountered with humans after a decade of working in medical marijuana, so she decided to mix a very small amount of cannabis oil in Monkey\u2019s food.

But I really do feel it gave her a quality of life at the end; instead of just fading away, she stayed strong right up until the end.\u201d  Veterinarians caution against pet owners taking matters into their own hands, because finding the correct dose can be tricky. While many pet medicines are just human drugs in different doses, the weight ratios between humans and animals can make it easy to accidentally give your pet an overdose. And pets overdosing on cannabis is already a serious problem in states where marijuana is legal.     It gave her a quality of life at the end; instead of just fading away, she stayed strong right up until the end.  Amanda Reiman     As with children, it\u2019s common for pets to stumble upon a high potency marijuana edible, eat it, and become incredibly ill and intoxicated.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some serious poisonings of animals [from marijuana] and even a couple of deaths,\u201d says the medical director at the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, Dr Tina Wismer. When it comes to pet meds, Wismer says it\u2019s not uncommon for a human medication to be applied to animals purely on the basis of anecdotal evidence. She believes more studies need to be done on the therapeutic use of cannabis on animals to find the right dose. Dr Sarah Brandon, a veterinarian and cofounder of Canna Companion, a hemp-based pet supplement company, says that over the last 18 years, she has administered cannabis to more than 4,000 animals, and is currently analyzing data before offering it to the medical community.  \u201cRight now, veterinarians have no guidance on this,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear out there, and they are scared to come out and recommend [cannabis]. A veterinarian can recommend a hemp-based product as a supplement, but they cannot encourage them to use marijuana.\u201d Dan Goldfarb, owner of Seattle-based Canna-Pet, describes the differences between hemp and marijuana: \u201cIt\u2019s like dog breeds: you can have a chihuahua or a great dane, both of which are dogs but are bred to exude very different characteristics.\u201d  Canna-Pet, Treatibles and Canna Companion are all strictly hemp-based, so they are allowed to sell their products outside of marijuana dispensaries \u2013 even online to states where marijuana is illegal \u2013 without the need of a prescription. This also affords them deniability when people like Dennis Miller say they just want to get their pet stoned. But there are a handful of companies who use straight marijuana in their pet products, who say that hemp is too limited.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen better results with a little THC,\u201d says Alison Ettel, founder of Treat Well, who has been using cannabis on a variety of animals for ten years and was recently invited to treat seals at the Marine Animal Center in Sausalito, California. She says that hemp works for some ailments like anxiety, but doesn\u2019t contain a number of medicinal properties that marijuana does, like appetite stimulation, and that hemp can be harmful to an animal with a compromised immune system. \u201cWe believe hemp can have more negative effects than positive.\u201d   Related: Expots: medical marijuana draws parents to US for their children's treatments    Ettel adds that while her products contain psychoactive properties, if used in the right dosage in proportion to the animal\u2019s size, there is no reason they should ever become intoxicated by it. Brian Walker\u2019s California company, Making You Better Brands, offers a marijuana based doggie shampoo for pain relief (along with similar products for horses). Walker says that the marijuana is never activated with heat, a process necessary for making the plant psychoactive. But his company is still regulated like any other in the cannabis industry, meaning pet owners can only buy it in a dispensary with a (human) prescription, and can\u2019t take it out of state. Walker said the lack of information available about the differences between hemp, active cannabis and inactive cannabis has prevented acceptance among veterinarians of medical marijuana. \u201cThey picture a dog eating a brownie and being high for two days,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with non-active cannabis they\u2019re not going to get high \u2013 they\u2019re going to get well.\u201d",
