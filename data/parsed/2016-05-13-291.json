  "body": "TGIF, all. Spare a thought for Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten, oh-so-close to the end of their first week of the election campaign, but still some hours from being handed the cold one. The leaders will shortly go head to head in their first debate, the Sky News People\u2019s Forum, moderated by political editor David Speers and broadcast live from 6pm AEST. They will take questions from 100 undecided voters at the Windsor RSL club in the marginal seat of Macquarie in north-western Sydney, which has been held by Liberal backbencher Louise Markus since 2010. Shorten spent the morning campaigning in western Sydney, following Turnbull\u2019s somewhat turbulent morning tea with local MP Fiona Scott there on Wednesday. He copped a bit of a ribbing on Twitter for inviting his supporters to watch the debate in an email with the subject line, \u201cYou busy tonight?\u201d \u2013 winking face was strongly implied.    Sneaky email from Bill Shorten asking me over for SkyNews and chill. #AusPol #SkyNews #PeoplesForum pic.twitter.com/m4KzF27H21\u2014 BT (@Br_Tr) May 13, 2016    The prime minister was on the trail in Adelaide in the morning, where he announced a $40m extension to the Tonsley rail line between Flinders university and the city. Both spent the afternoon preparing for the debate.    Blessed are the innovators #auspol pic.twitter.com/zOp8Ww8oZi\u2014 Heath Aston (@HeathJAston) May 13, 2016    Writing in the Australian Financial Review, Phillip Coorey said the debate was \u201clittle more than a dry run\u201d.  \u201cAnyone not at the pub or the pictures will be at home watching the footy. Chances are the hard-core element watching the debate will have to because it was part of their job (journalists, staffers etc) or political tragics who already have a fair idea who they will vote for.\u201d That sounds like us! We\u2019ll be live-tweeting at @guardianaus, using the hashtags #PeoplesForum and #ausvotes \u2013 and of course our indomitable deputy political editor Katharine Murphy will be at the helm of the live blog. Please share your thoughts. There will be more coverage and analysis on Guardian Australia later tonight and tomorrow. High court votes on Senate reform There was a unanimous decision in the high court earlier today to dismiss the challenge to Senate changes brought by Family First senator Bob Day. The government\u2019s reforms will change how people can vote for the upper house, and are meant to stop complicated preference deals that advantage minor parties. Day argued that the choice of voting above-the-line or below-the-line created different methods of voting in breach of the constitution:  It punishes those voters who vote for minor parties by threatening to kill off their votes and the fact that we had a fair hearing here in the high court ... I\u2019m satisfied that we do have in the high court a very, very good system of democracy.  But the high court rejected his challenge. Confused? First Dog on the Moon tried his best to explain it with the aid of bug-eyed marsupials and bright colours back in February. Basically, the reforms will mean no more Ricky Muirs, which First Dog reckons is a bad thing. So it\u2019s onwards and upwards to the 2 July double dissolution election under the new system of voting. Credlin offers Labor a (fairly average) slogan Peta Credlin, Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff, now Sky News political commentator, helpfully branded Malcolm Turnbull \u201cMr Harbourside Mansion\u201d. As slurs go, it\u2019s not the catchiest, and even Credlin didn\u2019t seem that married to it, qualifying her comments: \u201cMalcolm lives in Sydney, has a harbourside view and has done well in life. Done well, it\u2019s something to be proud of.\u201d So not only is it not an especially good nickname, it might even be construed as praise \u2013 but you can bet your bottom tax-free dollar that it won\u2019t be the last time we hear it. Credlin also criticised Turnbull for cancelling his scheduled walk-through of a western Sydney shopping mall after the tense stand-up with Scott. \u201cI would have thought ... that they might have been a bit more agile, a bit more nimble.\u201d  Finance minister Mathias Cormann was the first to leap to the PM\u2019s defence with this searing rejoinder to Credlin\u2019s criticism that the Turnbull was out of touch: \u201cMalcolm Turnbull is very much in touch.\u201d Jon Faine pressed treasurer Scott Morrison on ABC radio 774 in Melbourne \u2013 she wasn\u2019t being very helpful to the Coalition\u2019s cause, was she?  Morrison: \u201cWell, I know journalists like to commentate on commentators who commentate on commentators, I\u2019m not going to commentate on that.\u201d So that\u2019s that cleared up.

Buy an artist a beer this weekend. It\u2019s been a rough week \u2013 the worst-ever for the arts in the Australia, say some. The Australia Council has passed on drastic funding cuts from the 2015-16 budget to arts organisations, with organisations such as Meanjin, Next Wave festival, the Emerging Writers festival, Express Media \u2013 publishers of Voiceworks \u2013 and experimental dance company Force Majeure losing out completely. And it\u2019s only going to get worse, writes Eliza Sarlos. Meanjin editor Jonathan Green said it was apt that \u201cthe idea of the cultural cringe was first expressed in Meanjin\u201d. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ... An Australian security contractor was shot dead at the country\u2019s embassy in Baghdad late on Wednesday. The 34-year-old man, who has not been named, was an employee of Unity Resources Group, which provides security to the embassy. A statement released by foreign minister Julie Bishop said the circumstances surrounding his death would be thoroughly investigated, and that the high-level security of the embassy was being maintained.  The government extends its condolences to the family of the Australian man over this tragic incident. All appropriate assistance is being provided to his family.  And if today was a pop song ... Five days in, and Malcolm Turnbull has planted his first kiss of the election campaign \u2013 on 84-year-old Audrey Pratt of Adelaide. \u201cIt felt very, very special,\u201d she told AAP of the embrace, delivered on the prime minister\u2019s walk through a shopping centre in the suburb of Glenelg.    The first kiss of the campaign #ausvotes #auspol pic.twitter.com/4dy0tgJj7W\u2014 Elle Hunt (@mlle_elle) May 13, 2016    Pratt, an enthusiastic Turnbull supporter, said she wasn\u2019t going to let a bad knee stop her from meeting the man himself. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be out there. It\u2019s no good sitting back and thinking I\u2019m 84 and I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d Soundtrack: Hot Chocolate, obviously. Here\u2019s the soft-focus video for It Started With A Kiss.         \u201cBut you were only 84 years old and I had just about turned 61...\u201d    Enter your email address below to receive the Campaign catchup updates delivered to your inbox each weekday.
