Thirty-one for Fiorentina in the preceding Serie A campaign, making him the first Italian to win the European Golden Shoe. That scandalous overhead kick for Vicenza against Bologna back in 2000, during his first season of top-flight football. None of those, though, felt as magical to Toni as the goal he scored on Sunday night. A goal in a game that mattered not at all.   Related: Luca Toni bows out with penalty for Hellas Verona in win over Juventus    Toni\u2019s Verona were bottom of Serie A, with relegation long since confirmed. Their opponent, Juventus, had been crowned champions last month. Neither team had anything to gain from winning this match, nor anything to lose in defeat. For Toni, however, this was one final chance to make a memory. At 38 years old, he had announced his retirement. This was to be his last professional match. The question of what comes next has troubled him. Toni walked away from football for a short period in 2012, resolving that it was more important to spend time with his partner, Marta, after their first child was stillborn. Gradually, though, she encouraged him back into the game. As Toni confessed to Gazzetta dello Sport in 2013: \u201cRunning after a ball, scoring goals, celebrating and suffering in a stadium has been my whole life.\u201d What a life it has been. Besides the World Cup, Toni has also won the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal. He was the German top flight\u2019s leading scorer in 2007-08 and has been crowned Serie A\u2019s capocannoniere twice \u2013 most recently last season, when he became the oldest player to achieve such a feat. Toni has met the target he set himself two years ago, of crossing the 300-goal threshold before he retired. Not bad for a late bloomer, whose career only truly took off at the age of 26, when he hit the back of the net 30 times for Palermo in Serie B. This has been a difficult final season. Between injuries and lost form, Toni had scored only five times before Juventus came to visit. His determination to sign off on a brighter note was clear from kick-off, as he launched himself against the champions\u2019 rotated back line. He nearly opened the scoring in the 38th minute, thudding a left-foot shot into a post. Moments later, Alex Sandro clattered into Eros Pisano inside the box. Verona were awarded a penalty \u2013 and there was no doubting who would take it. Toni later confessed to having felt a little anxious as he stepped up to the spot, unsure whether to shoot right or left. Instead, he settled on a third path: chipping the ball right down the middle. A spoon or a cucchiaio, as they say in Italy \u2013 although as one joker pointed out, Toni\u2019s size-12 boots made this one more like a ladle. The striker has deployed this technique before. Toni earned Verona a draw at Milan last March with a cucchiaio, confessing afterwards that it was something he had been determined to try before he retired. If that goal was made special by its San Siro setting, then it paled in comparison to the one he scored on Sunday. \u201cThis was the most beautiful goal of my career,\u201d Toni said at full-time. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the goal that closes my career.\u201d He finishes with 324 across all competitions. Gazzetta billed Toni recently as \u201cthe last great Italian centre-forward\u201d \u2013 and in a season when no domestic player has scored more than 13 times in Serie A, that description does seem rather apt. The goals themselves, though, are only part of the picture. Toni was a true centre-forward: one who used his power and presence to hold the ball up, fight off defenders and bring team-mates into play. He reminded us of such traits in the buildup to Verona\u2019s second on Sunday. Toni was in a tight spot when he received the ball, facing towards his own penalty area as his team attempted to break out of their half. Quick wits and even quicker feet were required to elude a pair of opponents, Toni drawing the ball under his heel to wrongfoot Stefano Sturaro before pivoting around Leonardo Bonucci and then releasing Artur Ionita with a gorgeous outside-of-the-boot through ball. The Moldovan followed up with a super crossfield pass of his own to pick out Federico Viviani, who smashed his shot into the top corner.    Toni has represented 15 different clubs in his professional career and is beloved by supporters at many of those    Juventus pulled a goal back with an injury-time penalty but Verona held on to win 2-1. The result might not have mattered but Toni\u2019s part in it most certainly did. Substituted in the 85th minute so that he could receive a standing ovation, the forward returned to the pitch at full-time for another. He was most certainly not the only person at the Bentegodi with tears in their eyes. Toni has represented 15 clubs in his professional career and is beloved by supporters at many of those. In Verona, however, the affection feels especially strong. He has been with Hellas for only three years and yet he is their all-time leading scorer in top-flight matches. A banner hung by supporters on Sunday proclaimed Toni to be the new \u201cdeputy-mayor\u201d \u2013 because not even 48 goals in three seasons could earn him promotion above the Danish great Preben Elkjaer. Another one said simply:\u201cClone him\u201d. If only it were that easy. \u201cI\u2019m not very normal,\u201d confessed Toni at full-time. How grateful Italian football has been for that fact. Talking points     The fans pay tribute to Roma\u2019s Francesco Totti, who would only say \u2018we\u2019ll see\u2019 when asked about his future after the game against Chievo. Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPA    \u2022 It is not so long ago that we were asking whether Francesco Totti would retire at the end of this season \u2013 or move on to a different club \u2013 but, increasingly, the expectation is that he will sign a new contract at Roma. Even so, 53,000 fans turned out to celebrate him at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday \u2013 including many Ultras who had previously stayed away all season in protest at the division of the Curve \u2013 not wanting to risk missing his last game for the Giallorossi. Totti made sure to entertain them, coming off the bench and splitting open Chievo\u2019s defence with a brilliant first-time pass that Miralem Pjanic converted to seal a 3-0 triumph. Over Roma\u2019s last six games, the captain has averaged either a goal or an assist for every 22 minutes he spends on the pitch. He was coy with reporters afterwards, saying only \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d in response to questions about his future. Totti also wagged a finger in response to one man who said \u201csee you next season\u201d as he was leaving the stadium. Take it all with a pinch of salt \u2013 this is a man who likes to tease. Totti did pass another career landmark last weekend, moreover, making his 600th Serie A appearance. He is only the third player to do so, after Paolo Maldini and Javier Zanetti. \u2022 Roma\u2019s victory briefly moved them ahead of Napoli into second place but the Partenopei moved back in front by winning at Torino on Sunday evening. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn scored the first of his team\u2019s goals and needs two more from Napoli\u2019s final game, at home to Frosinone, in order to match the single-season Serie A record of 35 set by Gunnar Nordahl back in 1949-50. \u2022 Frosinone themselves were relegated after losing at home to Sassuolo. That result, coupled with Udinese\u2019s draw at Atalanta, means the fight for survival is now down to two teams. Palermo hold the edge over Carpi, moving one point ahead of the Biancorossi with a hard-fought draw at Fiorentina. But the Sicilians\u2019 final match, at home to Verona, might not be as straightforward as it looks. Hellas showed on Sunday that they still have some fight left in them and will be eager to stick it to Maurizio Zamparini, who accused them of going easy on Frosinone last month. \u2022 If Carpi do go down, they will have only themselves to blame. Well, themselves, or maybe just Jerry Mbakogu, who missed two penalties during Sunday\u2019s 3-1 loss at home to Lazio. \u2022 Genoa ended their run of almost three years without a success in the Derby della Lanterna by smashing Sampdoria 3-0. Vincenzo Montella was defiant afterwards \u2013 insisting that he was not embarrassed, despite the scale of the defeat. The Little Aeroplane has been linked with a variety of high-profile jobs in recent weeks, including Milan and the national team, but he has won only six out of 25 matches in charge of Samp and his team are averaging less than one point per game. \u2022 Inter have sewn up fourth place, putting themselves straight through to the Europa League group stage without the need for summer qualifiers \u2013 so they can go and exhaust themselves in the International Champions Cup instead \u2013 and Fiorentina are now locked into fifth. Sassuolo, meanwhile, maintained their one-point advantage over Milan in sixth. If they can maintain that position for one more week, then they will qualify for Europe as long as the Rossoneri lose the Coppa Italia final against Juventus. Results: Atalanta 1-1 Udinese, Bologna 0-1 Milan, Carpi 1-3 Lazio, Fiorentina 0-0 Palermo, Frosinone 0-1 Sassuolo, Inter 2-1 Empoli, Roma 3-0 Chievo, Sampdoria 0-3 Genoa, Torino 1-2 Napoli, Verona 2-1 Juventus",
