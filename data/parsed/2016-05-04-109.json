  "body": "With Donald Trump as the Republican party\u2019s presumptive nominee, it\u2019s time for him to start contemplating a running mate. Here are five options for the veep stakes for the outsider who has often said he would look for a number two with political experience: Chris Christie Christie\u2019s endorsement of Trump was a pivotal moment for the campaign. But while the New Jersey governor has been a helpful and loyal surrogate, he doesn\u2019t add any geographic balance or conservative credentials. Plus, the footage of Christie standing behind Trump looking like a hostage on Super Tuesday doesn\u2019t help. Newt Gingrich The former House speaker and 2012 presidential hopeful has long been a rare pro-Trump voice in Washington DC. Gingrich would bring considerable political experience and significant public profile as a running mate. It\u2019s just a question of whether Trump wants to double down on a ticket of thrice-married elderly men who love publicity. Mike Huckabee The former Arkansas governor and two-time presidential candidate has long been perceived as supportive of Trump. His daughter is a top political aide on the Trump campaign. While many fiscal conservatives view Huckabee warily, he has a solid social conservative thread and a folksy charm that would pair well with Trump\u2019s big city bluster. It would just mean Huckabee would have to yet again give up a lucrative contract with Fox News for uncertain prospects on the campaign trail. Mary Fallin The Oklahoma governor has reportedly expressed a willingness to be considered as Trump\u2019s running mate and the presumptive nominee praised her as possibility. A two-term governor of the Sooner State who previously served in Congress, her selection would allow Trump to have a woman with significant government experience on the ticket. However, she is best known in Oklahoma for her push to carry out death sentences despite court orders to the contrary. Joni Ernst The gun-totin\u2019, Harley-ridin\u2019, pig castratin\u2019 Iowa farm girl burst on to the scene when she won the Iowa Senate race in 2014. Ernst has shown no willingness to embrace Trump, but the 45-year-old first-term female senator would be an ideal running mate for any Republican. Ernst is an Iraq veteran who won in a swing state. And as her notorious campaign ad proved, she already has the Trumpian flair.",
