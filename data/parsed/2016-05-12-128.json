  "body": "When John Langley finished university in 2008, one of the worst financial crises in living memory was pummelling the UK. Banks were collapsing, many businesses were in turmoil and unemployment began to soar. It was a tough year to be a graduate looking for a job, but it was in those dark days that Langley had his first lightbulb moment. He noticed that there was very little support for graduates to realise the full array of potential career paths and that they needed expert guidance to achieve their goals. It wasn\u2019t until he had found success as a recruiter that this bud of an idea blossomed into a profitable business venture. Higher the Talent was founded in 2014 with the aim of matching graduates to their perfect job. Langley has brought the business from nothing to generating \u00a3315,000 in its second year, and it now boasts more than 130 clients. Despite the company\u2019s rapid rise to success, Langley proudly sticks to the values of nurturing graduate jobseekers developed during those difficult days after he finished his degree.  His staff \u2013 many of whom are recent grads \u2013 are his number-one priority. Without a team of talented employees, he says, it\u2019s impossible to build any lucrative business. \u201cWhen you run your own company you realise how valuable investment in your own staff actually is,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are the people that will help you achieve your goals and get you where you want to be. The only way that they can do that is if you help them progress in their own careers.\u201d That\u2019s why Langley not only pays his employees above-average salaries, but also offers an array of rewards for their hard work, such as nights out for a good month of business (and nights out to forget a bad month), flexible working hours and training opportunities to develop everyone on the team.  Linda Norris, team leader for Higher the Talent, nominated her boss for the category because of the importance Langley places on promoting a healthy work-life balance among the team \u2013 something she claims is unusual in a highly pressured industry where people are often expected to work long hours. She claims it has made a huge difference to the team\u2019s performance. Staff can find their own ways to wind down \u2013 Norris often chooses to do that in the gym. \u201cWhen you have been allowed an extra half hour in the gym in the evening and you come in the next day, you just feel so much better. Recruitment is really stressful, so when you come back you are 10 times more productive and don\u2019t feel that someone is working you to the ground.\u201d  She adds that because everyone feels appreciated by their boss, staff morale is very high and their retention rate is also excellent. Langley further ensures his employees feel valued by including them as much as possible in decision-making, whether that\u2019s brainstorming the best social network to use to attract new grads or consulting them on who to hire next. There are one-to-one meetings every week and he takes time to tailor personal development plans to each individual\u2019s needs. Norris says Langley is open, approachable and always available if you have an issue you would like to discuss. Taking the time to listen to your employees, Langley believes, is a key skill, which all business owners should take the time to nourish. \u201cAny good leader would say that their team is their biggest asset,\u201d he says, \u201cand in recruitment that couldn\u2019t be more true.\u201d John Langley was shortlisted in the Small Business Showcase competition\u2019s Leader of the Year category.
