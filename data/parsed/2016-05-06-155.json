  "body": "Hometown: Wellington, New Zealand.  The lineup: Baba Rossa (vocals, biscuit tin guitar), Mos locos (synth, vocals), EtonalE (bass carillon, vocals), Woild Boin (drums).  The background: Rumour \u2013 or at least someone called DJ Joe Rock of classic hits station WMMO \u2013 has it that Talking Heads are in the studio working on a new album and planning a tour for 2017. For those who believe the band\u2019s album run from their debut in 1977 until 1980\u2019s Remain in Light remains one of the greatest in music history, this is like hearing the Smiths and the Jam are reforming on the same day. Any hint that they\u2019re about to bury the hatchet and record a follow-up to 1988\u2019s Naked is bound to excite. Still, in the admittedly unlikely event that Joe Rock is wrong and they don\u2019t, there\u2019s always the Orchestra of Spheres to console you. They\u2019re great, and they\u2019re Talking Heads-ish, albeit a Talking Heads that uses biscuit tins and vacuums for instruments instead of, say, Bernie Worrell and Adrian Belew. They have 1.6m followers on Soundcloud and have been around for a while, only under the radar (evidently not a very powerful radar considering the title of their last album was Vibration Animal Sex Brain Music). They were \u201cborn out of Wellington\u2019s fertile creative music scene\u201d, and their members have names like Mos Iocos, EtonalE and Baba Rossa (Woild Boin bangs the drums, except he doesn\u2019t in the studio \u2013 that\u2019s someone or something called Tooth). Their influences range, they say, from kuduro and \u201cpsychedelic primary school disco\u201d to kwaito, free improv, shangaan electro, inner brain clap and funk puppetr\u00e9. Really, though, think a lo-fi Heads with a shoestring budget and the no-limits creativity often borne of penury. They\u2019ve been called \u201cfuturistic and unsettlingly primal\u201d and \u201cthe most out-of-this-world band in music today\u201d. Even Dan Snaith of Caribou has been singing the praises of their music which, they admit, offers the sort of escapist fantasy-funk you\u2019d want in \u201cdark times \u2026 of remote war, mass deceit and money worship\u201d.        On their new album Brothers and Sisters of the Black Lagoon, they have created an record of playful dance music designed to take your mind off the fact that we\u2019re all doomed, using vocal and tape experiments and lots of bells (they\u2019re obsessed with bells, for some reason). Alighting at any point on the album is sure to delight. In the Face of Love is like Heads offshoot Tom Tom Club\u2019s Genius of Love updated for 2016: quirky, quixotic avant-funk, with acid house squiggles and the sort of heavenly oohs and aahs that suggest Tina Weymouth being tickled by Chris Frantz. Trapdoors is off-kilter disco with a lyric about \u201cceramic popcorn exploding in craniums\u201d and a hi-life guitar figure countering the deep, pulsing bassline. Walking Through Walls stutters into life, with unison singing enforcing the feel of Orchestra of Spheres as a dippy cult on a polyphonic spree. The Reel World is pan-cultural exotica, lounge music from a distant planet. Cluster is presumably a paean to the German band of that name, although you never know with this crew. Actually, the track has the gruff male voice, attention to detail and sonic immaculacy of Swiss electro-surrealists Yello. Rocket No 9 has a scintillating stop-start throb while a female voice cries \u201cZoom zoom!\u201d and then, at the end, either \u201cVenus!\u201d or \u201cpenis!\u201d. Probably Venus, but it is a song about a rocket, so \u2026 Let Us Not Forget is more serious in tone, all drones and clangs, with the ominous tolling of a bell throughout. It\u2019s a mordant hymn to technology: \u201cLet us not forget our mobile phones. Let us not forget our mobile phone chargers. Let us not forget our electronic cigarettes. Let us not forget our memorable security question\u2026\u201d Finally, there\u2019s the lush, locked groove of Divine Horses that rises to a feverish tumult \u2013 exactly what you\u2019d want a reformed 21st-century Talking Heads to sound like. Let\u2019s hope good old Joe Rock is right. If not, have a dip in this Black Lagoon.  The buzz: \u201cPart Sun Ra otherworldiness, part Sublime Frequencies and part ESG ... Orchestra of Spheres blew us away\u201d - Dan Snaith, Caribou. The truth: More songs about mobile phones and money worship.  Most likely to: Forget about Talking Heads.  Least likely to: Forget their mobile phones.  What to buy: Brothers and Sisters of the Black Lagoon is released on 13 May. File next to: Yello, Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Can. Links: orchestraofspheres.com.  Ones to watch: Vanishing Twin, Emily Wells, Ice Cream, Xenia Rubinos, Haley Bonar.",
