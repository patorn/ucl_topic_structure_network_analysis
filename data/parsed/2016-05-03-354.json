  "body": "The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has blamed refugee advocates for the suicide attempts on Nauru and Manus, alleging they are encouraging detainees to self-harm in the hope of getting to Australia. A second refugee, Hodan Yasin, self-immolated on Nauru overnight and is in a Brisbane hospital in a critical condition. Pressed on his allegation, Dutton offered no examples of refugee supporters advocating acts of self-harm, but said his office received \u201cadvice\u201d and \u201cintelligence\u201d that it was occurring. \u201cThere is a lot of publicly available information in relation to some of the social media messaging as well,\u201d he said.   Related: Somali refugee in critical condition after setting herself alight on Nauru    \u201cI have previously expressed my frustration and anger at advocates and others who are in contact with those in regional processing centres and who are encouraging some of these people to behave in a certain way, believing that that pressure exerted on the Australian government will see a change in our policy in relation to our border protection measures,\u201d Dutton said. The government would not be swayed by public pressure, protests, or acts of self-harm. \u201cWe are not going to change those policies, and the advocates, by providing false hope to these people, really [are] to be condemned,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can provide offers of support, that is reasonable. But to provide advice otherwise is very dangerous.\u201d Ian Rintoul, a long-time refugee advocate and spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, said he had \u201cnever seen any evidence, not a single example\u201d of advocates encouraging self-harm. \u201cThe opposite is true,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the advocates who are always urging people, people who are desperate, not to harm themselves.\u201d Rintoul said Dutton\u2019s comments were \u201coffensive and demeaning\u201d, and that they were without foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Dutton does not have a shred of evidence for what he\u2019s saying. He offered no evidence at all. \u201cThis is a desperate act by the government trying to deflect blame for situation they have created.\u201d And he said the government\u2019s hardline stance on offshore processing would only contribute to the helplessness felt by those in detention. \u201cI think Dutton\u2019s dismissive attitude to these people\u2019s despair, is more likely to create the kinds of situations he says he is trying to avoid.\u201d An asylum seeker advocate, Natasha Blucher, described Dutton\u2019s statement as \u201cdespicable\u201d. \u201cHere we have a young 21-year-old girl who was so desperate the only option she felt she had was to burn herself alive, and all Dutton wants to do is play the blame game instead of working to make sure this never happens again,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Blucher is a former Save the Children worker who was among a group sacked in 2014 after being accused of encouraging self-harm. The group was later vindicated when it was revealed the accusation was untrue and they had been fired for political reasons. She said it was concerning to see Dutton had resorted to the same tactics in \u201cattempting to blame advocates for the failings of his policy settings\u201d. \u201cI would challenge Dutton to put forward any evidence he has of any advocates encouraging people to self-harm,\u201d Blucher said. Dutton had displayed \u201can absolute misunderstanding of mental health\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as though the department and the minister don\u2019t acknowledge that mental illness is a severe problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to denote any act of self-harm or suicidal ideation or suicide attempt as the result of some sort of political ideology or political strategy.\u201d Dutton had told media there were mental health professionals on the island to provide care, but Blucher said the mental illness among detainees was \u201csituational\u201d. \u201cIt does not help to provide mental health support while retaining the person in the environment that is harming their mental health,\u201d she said. The Australia Director at Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said Dutton \u201cshouldn\u2019t point the finger at refugee advocates when it\u2019s Australia\u2019s inhumane policies of offshore detention and deterrence that are driving people to the brink of despair\u201d. \u201cSelf-harm on Nauru isn\u2019t new,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery week, asylum seekers in detention on Nauru have been self-harming by cutting themselves, swallowing razor blades, poison, or trying to hang themselves with sheets.  \u201cThis is an escalation of those actions because people have lost all hope.\u201d Yasin is the second refugee on Nauru to self-immolate in the past week. Reports from Nauru suggest she has severe burns to 70% of her body, with her upper body and face most badly affected. Australia\u2019s immigration department says Yasin is 21 years old. However, sources on Nauru say she is only 19, having been sent to Nauru as a 16-year-old child three years ago. Department files also misspell her name as Hadon. She set herself alight in protest late on Monday afternoon in the OPC1 compound of the Nauru detention centre. Yasin was returned to Nauru less than a week ago, having been brought to Australia last November after being seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. Early last Wednesday morning, she was forcibly dragged out of the Brisbane immigration transit accommodation by guards. Fellow detainees say she screamed as she was carried away.  Last Wednesday, a 23-year-old Iranian refugee, Omid Masoumali, died two days after setting himself alight at Nibok refugee settlement on Nauru, in the presence of representatives from the United Nations. Video footage shot on a mobile phone, which Guardian Australia has chosen not to publish, shows him dousing himself in accelerant and shouting: \u201cThis is how tired we are; this action will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it any more.\u201d Masoumali\u2019s widow, also a refugee, has criticised the delay in getting him care on Nauru. She says it was hours before he was given painkillers. It was more than 22 hours before he was taken to a Brisbane hospital. Video footage of Masoumali at Nauru hospital shows him clearly conscious as he paces up and down while screaming \u2013 with severe burns apparent to his arms, legs, chest and back \u2013 while distressed friends plead for him to be given assistance. A second clip shows doctors and nurses struggling to administer painkillers, as Masoumali, still standing, continues to scream. People watching nearby are vomiting. Masoumali\u2019s widow told Guardian Australia her husband was not given a sheet or a place to lie down, and that the hospital \u201cdidn\u2019t even have a clean syringe\u201d. \u201cStaff in Nauru hospital couldn\u2019t help Omid in any way because they were unequipped,\u201d she said. \u201cA lack of proper equipment and facilities was the reason that staff couldn\u2019t help and treat Omid in the Nauru hospital.\u201d On Monday she said she was being kept in a Brisbane hotel by immigration authorities, denied access to a lawyer and sedated. The Nauru government has said Masoumali received \u201cthe highest level of care\u201d. The former prime minister, Tony Abbott, won the 2013 federal election on a primary campaign platform of \u201cstop the boats\u201d.    Related: The order to end Manus detention was predictable. The next step is not    Since then Labor has been assiduous in appearing in lockstep with the Coalition on asylum seeker policy. However, in recent days at least four Labor members have spoken out against the offshore detention regime.  The retiring MP Melissa Parke told a caucus meeting on Tuesday morning \u201cgreat harm is being done to people on Manus Island and Nauru\u201d. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said: \u201cIf we get the chance to form government we will make it clear through our actions we don\u2019t support indefinite detention; the people concerned will be resettled in third countries.\u201d Another member praised Shorten and opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles\u2019s handling of asylum seekers, saying Labor should \u201calways protect the interests of the most vulnerable\u201d. Shorten responded Labor had to have policies that avoided drownings at sea and that treated people within our care decently.",
