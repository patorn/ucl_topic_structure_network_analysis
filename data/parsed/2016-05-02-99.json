  "body": "Skepta: Konnichiwa  The thrilling revival of Skepta has mirrored that of UK grime itself. Before the Tottenham rapper was owning 2015 with his track Shutdown, his career had become derailed by the lure of major label money, and he was making cheesy tracks about Rolex watches with tacky dance routines in an attempt to mimic Dizzee\u2019s Bonkers rise. Skepta has since found strength through going back to basics, and although comeback album Konnichiwa has been delayed, you get the sense that it\u2019s because he\u2019s determined to get this one right.\u20226 May, Boy Better Know.     Back to basics \u2026 Skepta. Photograph: Roger Kisby/Getty Images    Busted With McBusted on the road last year, you could be forgiven for thinking that fans of early noughties pop-punk would be over re-formation hysteria. However, with the return of Charlie Simpson, who left Busted 10 years ago vowing never to return, 100,000 arena concert tickets were shifted in the first hour of their release. The band \u2013 also featuring Matt Willis and James Bourne \u2013 aim to entice fans old and new by bringing British YouTuber Emma Blackery and Teenage Dirtbag rock group Wheatus on the road for their Pigs Can Fly tour. Cartoonishly charismatic as ever. \u202211 May, Wembley SSE Arena, London. Then touring until 4 June.   Related: Scorchers: the hottest films of summer 2016    Bob Dylan: Fallen Angels Bob Dylan\u2019s late-career reinvention as a crooner continues with a second successive set of standards \u2013 all bar one previously recorded by Frank Sinatra. This most quixotic of performers is now spilling all his musical facets out, one after another \u2013 last year it was an 18CD set of every note he recorded during 1965 and 1966 \u2013 as if daring anyone to suggest they know what he represents. The contrast between the Thin Wild Mercury Sound of 50 years ago and the ragged crooner of today could hardly be greater. \u202220 May, Sony/Columbia. Adam Ant To tie in with a deluxe box set of Adam and the Ants\u2019 breakthrough second album, Kings of the Wild Frontier \u2013 which with its cocktail of African-inspired drums, spaghetti western guitar and Native American-influenced whooping and chanting is surely one of the most unlikely records in pop history to propel an artist to teenybopper stardom \u2013 the band\u2019s redoubtable mastermind, still a brilliant live performer, will take to the stage to play the album in its entirety. \u202223 May, Ipswich Regent theatre. Then touring until 10 June.     Classic album \u2026 Adam Ant, who is performing Kings of the Wild Frontier Photograph: REX/Shutterstock    Bruce Springsteen The Boss shows no signs of slowing down: at 66, he still stages large tours at a moment\u2019s notice, still plays for more than three hours, still leaves audiences exhilarated and baying for more. This latest jaunt with the E Street Band sees him revisit his 1980 double album The River, playing it in full and then adding on what for most bands would be a whole additional set of extra material. There\u2019ll be no gimmicks, no visual effects, no state-of-the-art technology; just rock\u2019s most versatile band and one man who can hold a stadium crowd in the palm of his hand. \u202225 May, Etihad Stadium, Manchester. Then touring UK and Ireland until 5 June.     Back to the river \u2026 Bruce Springsteen. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock    Radiohead After playing London\u2019s O2 on their previous trip to the capital, this time around Radiohead, much to the misery of millions of fans, decided to downscale to three nights at the 3,000-capacity Roundhouse, a former railway engine shed. The news of a tour was accompanied by the usual frenzied speculation about a new album, which, according to one member of their management company, sounds \u201clike nothing you\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. Regardless of whether ticketholders will be privy to revolutionary new material or simply slurring along to Karma Police, every era of the band\u2019s back catalogue guarantees melancholic euphoria. \u202226, 27 and 28 May, Roundhouse, London. Beth Orton: Kidsticks Not many people would have predicted Beth Orton\u2019s next move would be to collaborate on a krautrock-inspired electropop album with one of Fuck Buttons, but we\u2019re pleased it\u2019s happened. From the tracks Orton has premiered so far (Moon and 1973), Kidsticks promises to be a radical departure from 2012\u2019s folky Sugaring Season, one that is both synth-heavy and rhythmically interesting. \u202227 May, Anti Records.     Unlikely collaboration \u2026 Beth Orton. Photograph: Peter Kaminski / Barcroft Media    ABC: The Lexicon of Love II It\u2019s a bold move on the part of Martin Fry, the only remaining member of the ABC lineup who recorded their debut album, to announce a sequel, nearly 35 years on. The Lexicon of Love may be the most celebrated album to emerge from the early 80s \u201cnew pop\u201d movement: a lavish confection of classic pop songwriting, dancefloor infections and sumptuous strings and brass, the latter the work of arranger Anne Dudley, who reprises her role on the sequel. \u2022 27 May, Virgin/EMI.     Easy as ABC \u2026 Martin Fry. Photograph: Roger Sargent    Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul The day Dexys do something you expect is the day they cease to be Dexys. In 2012, One Day I\u2019m Going to Soar, the band\u2019s excellent comeback album after 27 years away, saw them embracing their theatrical side. But the forthcoming Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul appears to be an about-turn, consisting of soulful interpretations of predominantly Irish folk standards such as Carrickfergus and Curragh of Kildare. Kevin Rowland says it\u2019s a project he has wanted to get off the ground since the mid-80s, and with typical contrariness the band tell us that it is not a covers album. So there you go. \u20223 June, Rhino Records.     Dexys \u2026 still contrary after all these years.    AC/DC with Axl Rose AC/DC sacrificed a great deal of goodwill with the way they dispensed of their singer of 36 years, Brian Johnson, after doctors told him to quit or risk losing his hearing. Their statement on the matter was terse to the point of rudeness. The appointment of Guns N\u2019 Roses leader Axl Rose as his short-term replacement will shore up ticket sales, but raises questions: how will the world\u2019s most efficient rock\u2019n\u2019roll organisation cope with having the planet\u2019s most unpredictable frontman on board? \u20224 June, Olympic Stadium, London; 9 June, Etihad Stadium, Manchester. Lionel Richie Has last year\u2019s Glastonbury festival revived Lionel Richie\u2019s previously somewhat cheesy reputation? His pottery-based exploits in the Hello video combined with a dedication to the sexytime album sleeve had helped make him something of a guilty pleasure over the years. But his Sunday afternoon slot on the Pyramid stage drew more punters than any of the headliners. He\u2019ll be hoping to revive the communal magic at a series of arena shows from Colwyn Bay to Colchester. \u202214 and 15 July, St Austell, Cornwall. Then touring to 7 July.     Who you gonna call? \u2026 Lionel Richie at Glastonbury 2015. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images    Africa Oy\u00e9 2016 The Liverpool festival \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest free celebration of African and Caribbean music \u2013 returns with a lineup that includes much-praised new Congolese band Mbongwana Star and Ghanaian veteran Pat Thomas, along with Randy Valentine from Jamaica. \u2022June 18 to 19, Sefton Park, Liverpool. Glastonbury festival The annual hippy utopia that is Glastonbury returns, and following last year\u2019s divisive Kanye set, this year\u2019s headliners pander to the British masses. Muse, Adele and Coldplay top the bill on the Pyramid stage, but there\u2019s plenty to uncover elsewhere, with leftfield loopiness, seasoned legends, and, er, Jeremy Corbyn. Confirmed names so far include LCD Soundsystem, PJ Harvey, Beck, Foals, Earth, Wind & Fire, Ellie Goulding, Skepta, the 1975, Grimes, Mac DeMarco, Savages, Art Garfunkel and Cyndi Lauper. \u202222 to 26 June, Worthy Farm, Somerset.

Photograph: Getty Images    Rae Sremmurd: StremLife 2  Rae Sremmurd are two Mississippi brothers, now based in Atlanta, who are happy to mess around with hip-hop\u2019s preconceptions. Songs about Donald Trump? Live shows in snorkelling gear? Why not, eh? With tracks such as Start a Party, Shake It Fast and Set the Roof, don\u2019t expect forthcoming album SremmLife 2 to be this year\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly. But do expect it to sound great when you\u2019re drunk.\u202224 June, Eardrummers.     Get the snorkelling kit! \u2026 Rae Sremmurd at Coachella. Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images    Beyonc\u00e9 Her new album, Lemonade, has led some to claim Beyonc\u00e9 is a kind of musical cross between Martin Luther King and Maya Angelou. She\u2019s also a shrewd businesswoman who knows precisely the value of her brand \u2013 which is why tickets for her shows aren\u2019t just seated or standing: you can also get BeyHive, BeyGoldCircle, Platinum and Beyswag packages, depending on just how much money you want to spend. The shows will be spectacular, but the real winner will be Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bank account. \u202228 June, Stadium of Light, Sunderland. Then touring until 7 July.   Related: Curtain-raisers: the best theatre of summer 2016    Maxwell: blackSUMMERS\u2019night Before there was Miguel there was Maxwell. Twenty years after his definitive neo-soul album, Urban Hang Suite, the Brooklyn singer returns to the jazz-inflected R&B scene he helped establish. The new album, blackSUMMERS\u2019night, comes after a seven-year absence, during which he turned 40, and experienced the deaths of his cousin and his grandmother. Part two of a musical trilogy \u2013 following 2009\u2019s Grammy award-winning BLACKsummers\u2019night \u2013 finds the artist readjusting his mindset but retaining his inimitable smoothness. \u20221 July, Sony/Columbia. Possibly Colliding This new music weekend curated by contemporary composer and pianist Nils Frahm boasts boundary-pushing musicians, from Penguin Cafe, Wildbirds and Peacedrums to Britten Sinfonia Voices. The German-born Frahm, who sits where contemporary classical meets electronic music, will also play his only gig of 2016. \u20221 to 3 July, Barbican, London. Love Supreme Jazz Festival  The South Downs festival returns with an ambitious mix of big-name jazz, soul, funk, r&b and hip-hop. Pop legends such as Burt Bacharach and Grace Jones share the bill with jazz-inspired singer-songwriters Esperanza Spalding and Melody Gardot, meteorically risen saxist-bandleader Kamasi Washington, the new trio of guitarist John Scofield, pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Mark Guiliana, as well as a raft of local talent. \u20221 to 3 July, Glynde, Lewes.

Photograph: C Brandon/Redferns via Getty Images    Kendrick Lamar at Hyde Park Last year, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly won every critics\u2019 poll going, from Pitchfork to Waste Management News (probably), and garnered praise for confronting the rising inequalities and racial tension bubbling away in America, and for its melding of modern production (courtesy of Flying Lotus, Thundercat) with the retro feel of 70s jazz and psychedelic soul. But having to translate its anger and underlying torment to a sunny park in London \u2013 not always the easiest outdoor music venue in which to make a connection \u2013 means the challenges haven\u2019t ended for him just yet. \u20222 July, BST Hyde Park, London. Carole King at Hyde Park Perhaps the success of Beautiful, the musical based on her songs and life story, has convinced the queen of the Laurel Canyon set that it\u2019s worth her coming to London to perform her 1971 smash album Tapestry in its entirety for the first time. While audience tears will doubtless be shed, it\u2019s a moot point whether standing in a crowd of 60,000, a quarter of a mile from the stage, is the best way to hear this intimate record being played live. \u20223 July, BST Hyde Park, London.

Photograph: DDP USA/Rex/Shutterstock    T in the Park In its second year at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire, the T in the Park festival will showcase the titans of baggy, EDM and funk pop on the main stage. Headliners the Stone Roses, Calvin Harris and the Red Hot Chili Peppers top a populist bill that also includes old-school ravers Faithless, new-school electronic acts Jamie XX and Disclosure, acoustic revivalist Jake Bugg, indie veterans Shed 7 and the Coral, and chart pop disruptors Bastille, the 1975 and Jess Glynne. \u20228 to 10 July, Strathallan Castle, Perthshire. Womad 2016 Britain\u2019s best-known world music festival has succeeded thanks to its bravely eclectic approach. This year\u2019s lineup has Senegalese veteran Baaba Maal, Saharawi star Aziza Brahim, Colombia\u2019s Sidestepper and Vietnam\u2019s Hanoi Masters. There\u2019s also American funk and soul from George Clinton Parliament Funkadelic. \u202228 to 31 July, Charlton Park, Wiltshire.     Womad veteran \u2026 Baaba Maal. Photograph: Seyllou/AFP/Getty Images    Flit  A handful of folk\u2019s most visionary thinkers collaborate with BAFTA-winning animators to explore tales of migration through music and animation. Becky Unthank and Edinburgh-born singer songwriter Adam Holmes perform songs by Scottish musician Martin Green (best known as Lau\u2019s accordion genius) with lyrics \u2013 inspired by first-hand stories \u2013 by Karine Polwart, Aidan Moffat, Sandy Wright and Anais Mitchell. Whiterobot (Will Anderson and Ainslie Henderson ) bring their trademark wit and wisdom to the visuals.\u202210 to 11 August, Edinburgh International Conference Centre. Green Man festival Arguably the summer\u2019s nicest festival \u2013 its closest rival is End of the Road, in Dorset in September \u2013 Green Man offers a stunning location in the Brecon Beacons, plenty to do that isn\u2019t music, including talks, films and activities, and a list of artists who bathe in acclaim: Belle & Sebastian, James Blake, Julia Holter, Jason Isbell, White Denim, Floating Points and many more. Do take waterproofs though: Green Man has a reputation for dampness. \u202218 to 21 August, Brecon Beacons, Wales.     Stunning location \u2026 Julia Holter plays the Green Man festival. Photograph: Tom Watkins/Rex/Shutterstock    Reading and Leeds festivals The rite-of-passage festivals for kids who have just got their GCSE results are now split three ways: part rock, part dance, part hip-hop (with a smattering of pop). It\u2019s hard to see what appeal Red Hot Chili Peppers will have for the teens, but Disclosure, Foals, the 1975, Skrillex\u2019s Jack \u00dc and A$AP Rocky will surely attract heaving throngs. Those who miss the days when Reading was all about metal should congregate at the Pit stage to catch the likes of Mastodon. \u202226 to 28 August, Richfield Avenue, Reading, and Bramham Park, Leeds.",
