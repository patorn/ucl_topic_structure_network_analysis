  "body": "A new Radiohead album must mean a new \u201cwar\u201d with Spotify.  As soon as A Moon Shaped Pool was made available on Sunday evening, there was much furrowing of brows, chewing of pencils and alighting on the same point \u2013 that it wasn\u2019t available on Spotify. Apart from the first two singles. So, in fact, 18% of the album is on Spotify. But ignore that: the whole album isn\u2019t on Spotify and, as with everything Radiohead do, this immediately took on colossal import.  \u201cIn an affirmation of its principles, Radiohead boycotted leading streaming service Spotify,\u201d trumpeted the Daily Mail. \u201cRadiohead blackball Spotify,\u201d thundered Music Business Worldwide, adding a personal twist: \u201cThom Yorke just got his own back on Spotify.\u201d   Related: Radiohead: A Moon Shaped Pool review \u2013 something they've never achieved before    All of this stems from Yorke pulling the Atoms for Peace album from Spotify (and other streaming services) in 2013, and then calling Spotify \u201cthe last desperate fart of a dying corpse\u201d in an interview with the Mexican website Sopitas. It is a quote that will haunt Yorke until his own final anal emission and has become the frame in which every subsequent story about him and streaming is presented.  There is a reductive narrative being conveyed here. As with the continual recycling of the Blur/Oasis \u201cbattle\u201d from two decades ago, there is a keenness to dial up the truculence. In one corner is Thom \u201cSmasher\u201d Yorke from Oxford. In the other corner is Daniel \u201cCrusher\u201d Ek from Stockholm. They are not just fighting each other, they are fighting for the very future of the music industry. Or something. It\u2019s akin to the sketch from The Day Today in which Chris Morris goads the Australian foreign secretary and a minister from the British Foreign Office into military action over a trade disagreement. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Morris roars, relishing the imminent conflict. \u201cYes! It\u2019s war!\u201d Except in this case, it\u2019s not a war. It\u2019s not even a playground dust-up. It\u2019s a band, as is their right, choosing where to put their music. For now, A Moon Shaped Pool is only available to stream on Apple Music and Tidal, two services that recently locked down exclusives with, respectively, Drake and Beyonc\u00e9. So the Radiohead album is only a semi-exclusive. All of the band\u2019s other albums, with the exception of In Rainbows, are on Spotify, so that confuses their \u201cprinciples\u201d somewhat. It\u2019s less of a blackball and more of a very light grey or hard to distinguish from white-ball.    Related: Spotify hopes to stream new Radiohead album soon    Radiohead are shepherding fans to iTunes, Apple Music, Amazon and Tidal, but are also selling the album direct from their own website for between \u00a39 and \u00a313 for a download, \u00a310 for the CD, \u00a320 for the vinyl and \u00a360 for a deluxe edition. They managed to sell 100,000 copies of the \u00a340 In Rainbows box sets in 2007 and, given the loyalty of their fans, we can expect similar numbers with this album. As one of the biggest cottage industries in music, Radiohead do not need Spotify.  But nor does Spotify need Radiohead. While it will issue a placid press statement (\u201cwe look forward to making the rest of \u2018A Moon Shaped Pool\u2019 available on Spotify as soon as we can\u201d), a look at the numbers reveals just how little the service needs these 11 songs alongside the other 30m tracks it has on offer.            Burn the Witch has been played just short of 3m times on Spotify since its release last week. Pretty impressive, until you note that the service has more than 100 million users. Given it\u2019s Radiohead, the people who played the track will have done so multiple times. So we can estimate that the people playing Burn the Witch make up less than 1% of Spotify\u2019s total user base. Helpfully, Spotify also makes public other metrics. Radiohead have 4.7 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and are the 196th most played act. That means that 95.3% of Spotify\u2019s users have literally no interest in Radiohead. A Moon Shaped Pool not being there could potentially irk 4.7 million people, but actually Radiohead do not appear on the radars of the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s users.  A look at how the band\u2019s catalogue has performed on Spotify \u2013 considering that they will have chalked up multiple plays from users \u2013 reveals this fact in stark terms. Cumulative plays for Pablo Honey run to 119.1m, with 103m of those streams being for Creep, a statistic bound to cheer up Thom Yorke. For The Bends, it\u2019s 102.2m, for OK Computer it\u2019s 159.1m, for Kid A it\u2019s 61.5m, for Amnesiac it\u2019s 34.7m, for Hail to the Thief it\u2019s 49.3m and for The King of Limbs it\u2019s 45.5m. Spotify users\u2019 interest is clearly in the deep back catalogue of the band (or, to put it another way, in their most accessible music). Each album in the Radiohead discography tends to do slightly less well than the one preceding it. Maybe A Moon Shaped Pool could reverse that downward trend, but the truth is that Radiohead, with each release, appear to become less, not more, relevant to Spotify\u2019s users \u2013 and therefore to Spotify as a company.             If it was Drake (31.5m monthly listeners) or Rihanna (31.6m monthly listeners) going to \u201cwar\u201d with Spotify, it might be a serious concern for the service. As it stands, the former still hasn\u2019t put Views on there, but the latter soon let Spotify have Anti, after its initial exclusive period on Tidal. Even the much publicised dispute with Taylor Swift that saw her pull her entire catalogue from Spotify in November 2014 was less a \u201cwar\u201d and more a storm in a teacup. That month, Spotify had 12.5m paying subscribers; by June the next year, it had 20m paying subscribers \u2013 by far its biggest growth spurt at that time. Subscribers still flocked to Spotify, even though it didn\u2019t have Red or 1989.    Related: Radiohead fans review A Moon Shaped Pool \u2013 'it feels like a return to form'    While it is temptingly simple to explain Radiohead\u2019s relationship with Spotify as an epic battle on the scale of Game of Thrones, the reality is that it is business as usual for Spotify, and for Radiohead, and for so many acts who make the vast majority of their income today from touring rather than streaming. Billboard recently estimated that Taylor Swift generated $73.5m last year. Of that, $61.7m came from her tour, and a mere $564,000 came from streaming. Not being on Spotify is not going to put Thom Yorke in the poor house and, equally, Radiohead\u2019s new album not being on Spotify is not going to see the company close overnight.  Rock stars are known for having sizeable egos, and a belief that when they take a stand it makes a difference. But the truth is that a handful of huge acts keeping their music off a digital music service is like putting a Wotsit on a train track and expecting a derailment.",
