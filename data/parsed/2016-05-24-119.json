  "body": "1 | More political will The sad irony is that we\u2019re asking governments to make commitments on principles that they\u2019re already obliged to uphold. Keep your doors open for asylum seekers. Allow humanitarian agencies to access people in need. Don\u2019t target schools or hospitals. These calls are already enshrined in international law. A renewed commitment can help draw attention to a violation, but proper change in Syria and elsewhere won\u2019t come without mechanisms to enforce compliance, and that requires one thing: political will. Fred Abrahams, associate director for programme, Human Rights Watch, Berlin, Germany @fredabrahams 2 | Make \u2018Leave No One Behind\u2019 more than just a catchphrase    Related: The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for'    We\u2019ve got to hold agencies accountable to implement inclusive approaches more systematically through funding. Take the UN Gender Marker for example: until recently that has been applied only at proposal stage with no follow-up on implementation. The system must consolidate different levels of accountability for ensuring no one is left behind \u2013 in funding, coordination and leadership. Howard Mollett, senior policy adviser, Care International, London, UK @HowardMollett 3 | Develop a more coherent policy on displacement  We need a real push for commitments to decrease displacement, finance more coherent responses to displacement, and to integrate better protection for the displaced into national legislation.Lesley Bourns, policy analysis and innovation, United Nations OCHA New York, US 4 | Pinpoint where we went wrong as a sector An unfortunate consequence of pressures on the industry to be more risk adverse, meet deadlines, and not run over budget means we are no longer reaching the most vulnerable people. Even a policy as sensible as \u2018value for money\u2019 pushes aid away from those most in need, because reaching the most vulnerable people is always the most expensive. With major donors prioritising their national interests, we\u2019ve been leaving entire crises behind for years. It\u2019s also not as if the special needs of the elderly, or the disabled, haven\u2019t been recognised for decades. So what I\u2019d like to see out of the WHS is a lot more analysis of what went wrong in the first place, rather than well-intentioned declarations to do better in future.Marc DuBois, independent humanitarian consultant and analyst, London @Humanicontraria 5 | Put the money where our mouths are   Related: Secret aid worker: 'It is time to pass the UN leadership baton to a new generation'     Our current method of coordinating an international humanitarian response to a disaster still seems designed more for a mission to Mars than as a way of throwing money and resources behind the many people and organisations already working on the ground before the outsiders arrive. The Grand Bargain includes a commitment to 25% humanitarian funding to local and national responders by 2020, but we need to start putting a lot more money where our mouths are now when it comes to supporting local action. David Fisher, acting manager policy, research and diplomacy nit, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Geneva, Switzerland 6 | Create an independent body for assessing needs  We do have the tools to assess the needs of the most vulnerable but they often get squeezed out under pressures of delivering for the masses. Donors often don\u2019t trust the figures and budgets produced by humanitarian agencies. The UK International Development Committee has called for the establishment of an independent capacity to undertake needs assessments alongside humanitarian agencies. Simon Lawry-White, humanitarian practice adviser, Crown Agents 7 | Highlight that any commitments made must be tracked At the WHS, there are a mind-boggling number of agendas in the UN secretary-general\u2019s report \u2013 many very plausible \u2013 and a spectacular array of diverse commitments emerging from the manifold actors who constitute the humanitarian system. This is very hard to digest currently, but we must think long term about how we would monitor the implementation of any commitments that come out of the summit. Michael Mosselmans, head of humanitarian policy practice and advocacy, Christian Aid, London, England @michaelmoss44 8 | Work with states to develop humanitarian policies at home   Related: World Humanitarian Summit: who to follow on Twitter    One aspect that has not got much attention so far at WHS is the steps states can and should take at home to better manage international humanitarian assistance. Shockingly few, including those regularly beset by major disasters, have laws, rules or institutional measures for this in place. Without these rules, they cannot really be in the driver\u2019s seat when disasters strike. David Fisher 9 | Don\u2019t stay silent about the securitisation agenda  This is a huge issue but one that\u2019s been barely mentioned in the lead up to the summit. This year we\u2019ve seen a new UK Aid strategy that \u2013 even for humanitarian aid \u2013 expressed the value of aid almost entirely in terms of self interest and domestic security. It was left to the defence strategy to acknowledge there was a moral and principled case for aid. I\u2019d like to see more people speak up about this.
