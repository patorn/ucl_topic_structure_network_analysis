  "body": "Peta Credlin has suggested in an opinion piece attacking Labor\u2019s record on asylum seekers that some advice by government lawyers warned that turning back boats carrying asylum seekers was illegal. In a piece in the Daily Telegraph about Labor \u201cdivision\u201d on asylum seeker policy, Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff said there was \u201cevery chance the boats will start again if Labor is put back in charge of our borders\u201d. \u201cDoubtless, there\u2019d be a barrage of human rights activists, including some government lawyers, again claiming that turnbacks are illegal.\u201d   Related: Greens would demand asylum seeker policy change under any deal with Labor    The article did not specify when advice was provided to the Australian government that turnbacks were illegal. Credlin\u2019s statement echoes comments Abbott made in a Quadrant essay about the national security legacy of his government that some government lawyers warned about the legality of Operation Sovereign Borders. In the essay Abbott wrote: \u201cAt numerous stages, Operation Sovereign Borders could have foundered. Some media claimed that harsh treatment of boat people was being hidden. Some government lawyers claimed that the operation was beyond power.\u201d Abbott said after he became prime minister he told border protection officials \u201cin absolutely unambiguous terms, that the most compassionate thing we could do was stop the deaths at sea by ending the people-smuggling trade\u201d. \u201cThat was their duty: to stop the boats by all lawful means notwithstanding fierce controversy at home and possible tension abroad.\u201d In August 2012 the Houston report to the Gillard government canvassed the possibility of boat tow-backs and said they would need the consent of the other country and \u201cwould need to be made in accordance with Australian domestic law and international law\u201d, including obligations not to take asylum seekers back into danger. It said the conditions for turnbacks to Indonesia were not met. Before turnbacks were reinstated by the Abbott government in 2013, none had been attempted since 2001. None were conducted by the Rudd and Gillard governments. Guardian Australia contacted the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, in March and again on Sunday to ask whether legal advice to the Abbott-Turnbull government said Operation Sovereign Borders was beyond power and tow-backs were illegal. The Coalition government has maintained boat tow-backs are lawful. Amnesty International has said Australia\u2019s policy to return boats to countries where asylum seekers would be in danger is in breach of international law. Credlin said Labor leaders opposed tow-backs in 2007 by claiming the practice was impossible, illegal and impractical. \u201cAll along, the real problem was that Labor didn\u2019t like it.\u201d She described the purchase of orange life rafts to return \u201cwould-be illegal arrivals who\u2019d scuttled their own boats\u201d as a \u201cvital new element\u201d Abbott had added to Howard\u2019s policies. \u201cThis idea did not come from experts. It came from a prime minister and a government that simply wasn\u2019t going to be overcome: not by the greed of people smugglers, not by the determination of would-be illegal migrants ... and not by the defeatism of the former Australian government.\u201d Credlin said the officials who had told the Labor government it \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop the boats\u201d were the same officials who advised the Coalition government that did.   Related: Campaign catchup: leaders go head-to-head in front of election diehards    Labor has said it will \u201cnot allow policy which sees the mass drowning of vulnerable people\u201d, in effect replicating the government\u2019s policy including use of controversial boat tow-backs.  On Saturday, Shorten said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the government hasn\u2019t tried harder with nations in our region ... I promise that we will make sure that we process these people and get them into nations in our region but we will not reopen the seaways.\u201d Credlin also sought to play down her comments describing the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as \u201cMr Harbourside Mansion\u201d. \u201cYes, he is \u2018Mr Harbourside Mansion\u2019, but he and Lucy bought their home after many years of hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has an inspirational self-made background and he has to disable Labor\u2019s attack by telling his story rather than let them define him.\u201d",
