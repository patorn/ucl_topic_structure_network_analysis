David de Gea is understood to be ready to file out of Old Trafford in an orderly fashion if Louis van Gaal remains in charge, while the Daily Mail report that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is so tired of waiting for a concrete offer from the club that he has entered into \u201cshock talks\u201d with Paris Saint-Germain.   Related: David de Gea to consider Manchester United future if Louis van Gaal stays    The word on the boulevards of the French capital is that United have offered confident Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic a one-year deal, with the option of a second season should things go well, but his agent, Mino Raiola, was quick to rubbish the story and announce that, like his client\u2019s famous autobiography, it is a work of fiction. \u201cIn this world we have to accept some journalists use their imagination and make things up,\u201d said Raiola. \u201cThe story is not factual.\u201d In other news pertaining to United, the Mirror says club scouts were spotted at Sporting Lisbon\u2019s match against Braga on Sunday to keep tabs on midfielders and long-term targets William Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio. Real Madrid fanzine and Spanish sports daily AS claims that Pep Guardiola hopes to make a Manchester City player out of Germany midfielder Toni Kroos, while its French counterpart L\u2019\u00c9quipe is trumpeting the news that both Liverpool and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are hitching their skirts in the direction of the 20-year-old Monaco striker Thomas Lemar. Meanwhile in Italy, the pink paper that is La Gazzetta dello Sport says Serie A\u2019s record-breaking top scorer Gonzalo Higua\u00edn is flattered by interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United and is agitating for the release clause in his contract with Napoli to be reduced from \u00a372m to a more manageable \u00a347m.   Related: Andros Townsend says Rafael Ben\u00edtez can get Newcastle \u2018up and challenging\u2019    West Ham suits have returned to the drawing board after having a \u00a325m bid for Bournemouth duo Callum Wilson and Matt Ritchie rejected and after doodling for a while have sketched a caricature of Newcastle\u2019s Andros Townsend. One of very few players to actually enhance his reputation while playing for the Magpies this season, Townsend has an \u00a38m release clause in his contract but may opt to stay at St James\u2019 Park to help his team secure a quick return to the Premier League. Georginio Wijnaldum, who blew hot and cold throughout his maiden season at Newcastle, is also being courted by the Hammers. Arsenal\u2019s interest in teenage Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney has been well documented in these quarters and the Daily Record claims the north London side are ready to make their move. \u201cThe Gunners are weighing up the prospect of taking the plunge on the 18-year-old this summer as English rivals circle around the talented left-back,\u201d it says, citing Manchester City and Liverpool as the Premier League sides who are also interested in securing the youngster\u2019s scrawl. And finally, Gianluca Lapadula has scored 24 goals in 38 appearances for Pescara this season and is ready to leave the Serie B club to clamber aboard the Leicester City Champions League bandwagon.",
