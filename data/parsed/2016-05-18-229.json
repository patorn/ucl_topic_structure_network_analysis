  "body": "David Cameron is seeking to look beyond divisions in the Conservative party over Europe by promising to \u201cincrease life chances\u201d through a programme of social reform in the Queen\u2019s speech, including changes to prisons, schools and adoption.   Related: Queen's speech 2016: monarch unveils 20 bills to parliament \u2013 live    The government\u2019s annual legislative programme includes 20 bills, on topics ranging from streamlining the planning system to tackling extremism \u2013 as well as three carried over from the previous session, including the investigatory powers bill, which will make it easier for public bodies to monitor communications. But the agenda was immediately criticised by former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith for deliberately avoiding controversy in the run-up to the 23 June EU referendum. Speaking in the House of Lords amid the traditional pageantry of the state opening of parliament, the Queen said: \u201cMy government will use the opportunity of a strengthening economy to deliver security for working people, to increase life chances for the most disadvantaged and to strengthen national defences.\u201d     The Queen leaves Buckingham Palace for the Houses of Parliament.

Some Conservatives have been infuriated by the dire warnings about the consequences of Brexit, orchestrated by Downing Street. But the prime minister will have been cheered by a new poll, carried out by Ipsos Mori for the Evening Standard, which suggested Remain has pulled ahead by 55% to 37% \u2014 the strongest lead for three months, and perhaps a hint that the \u201cProject Fear\u201d strategy is working. In briefing notes issued before the Queen\u2019s Speech, Cameron said: \u201cIn the past six years, whether in education or welfare, this government has consistently demonstrated that we will take on difficult arguments, make difficult choices and undertake big and bold reforms to spread opportunity. This Queen\u2019s speech is no different.\u201d He described the package of measures as: \u201ca one nation Queen\u2019s speech from a one nation government\u201d. But Duncan Smith, the Eurosceptic former work and pensions secretary, accused Cameron and his colleagues of watering down potentially controversial changes, to avoid confrontation as the debate rages over Britain\u2019s future in the European Union.           Dennis Skinner shouts \u2018hands off the BBC\u2019 ahead of Queen\u2019s speech \u2013 video    \u201cMany Conservatives have become increasingly concerned that in the government\u2019s helter-skelter pursuit of the referendum, they have been jettisoning or watering down key elements of their legislative programme. Whether it is the trade union bill or the BBC charter proposals, it seems nothing must stand in the way of winning the referendum.\u201d He also lamented the absence of proposals on underlining the supremacy of parliament, mooted earlier this year in a bid to placate Eurosceptics. \u201cThe fear in government must be that as no one in Britain buys the idea that the EU has been reformed, the sovereignty bill would draw the public\u2019s attention back to that failure,\u201d he said. There was little detail on a long-promised British bill of rights in the speech, with the Queen simply saying, \u201cproposals will be brought forward\u201d. A draft bill is expected to be published after the referendum, and will stoke controversy on government backbenches, with some Tories \u2013 including the home secretary, Theresa May \u2013 believing it should supplant the European convention on human rights.

Devolution was another major theme, with the government promising to implement new measures to allow local authorities to keep the proceeds of business rates, and underpin George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d.

More schools will be forced to become academies \u2013 but only in poorer-performing areas, after a backbench backlash forced the government to abandon plans to make all schools academies by 2022. Local authorities will be encouraged to prioritise adoption over short-term foster placements for children in care, in a children and social work bill.   A modern transport bill will \u201censure that the UK is at the forefront of technology for new forms of transport, including autonomous and electric vehicles\u201d. An NHS (overseas visitors charging) bill will allow the government to recoup the costs of hospital treatment from EU visitors.

Responding for Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said the government was a \u201cdriverless car\u201d with ministers asleep at the wheel. He said the aims of Cameron\u2019s prison reform agenda were welcome but did not go far enough, highlighting the violence and suicide rates in jails. While Conservative MPs heckled him and made jokes, he refused to give way during the 40 minute speech, saying the crisis \u201ccould not be solved by laughing\u201d. The Labour leader highlighted massive cuts to adult social care and other public services that would not be addressed by the Queen\u2019s Speech. However, he supported the measures on adoption, the sugar tax and reregulating bus services to expand access to public transport. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: \u201cThis speech should have been about laying out a bold plan for the future but it\u2019s not. It smacks of a prime minister desperate to create a legacy. Frankly, that is just vain and will be vain. He won\u2019t be remembered as a social reformer but as the man who trashed the legacy of the coalition and put Britain\u2019s place at the world at risk.\u201d Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader, said the Queen\u2019s Speech was a \u201cwasted opportunity for progressive action on pensions, social security and the economy\u201d. Children\u2019s charities said boosting \u201clife chances\u201d was irrelevant without dealing with underlying poverty. Matthew Reed, Chief Executive of The Children\u2019s Society, said: \u201cthe government\u2019s welcome interest in improving life chances will mean little without a concerted effort to tackle child poverty, which is projected to rise significantly in the coming years.\u201d",
