While it\u2019s easy to focus on Trump\u2019s celebrity, his status as an \u201coutsider\u201d and his Twitter outbursts, what truly sets him apart from other candidates is his most remarkable trait: he appears to be completely immune to one of the most damaging accusations in politics: the \u201cflip-flop\u201d. Too many pundits (including me) tried to view Trump as an aberration. Instead, his campaign shows the direction national politics might be heading: toward pure demagoguery, with candidates like Trump who can say whatever plays best in the moment and never be taken to task for it.   Related: Donald Trump represents the party base. Leaders must finally admit it | Lucia Graves    What a difference four years makes. When Mitt Romney was running for president in 2012, opponents from both parties lambasted him for his ever-shifting positions. Romney\u2019s Republican rival John Huntsman called him a \u201cwell-lubricated weathervane\u201d. Whether it was his moveable stances on Romneycare or his attempts to distance himself from positions that were popular in Massachusetts but might not play nationally, Romney appeared to be so malleable that Democrats launched a (now sadly defunct) website called \u201cMitt v Mitt\u201d. Democrats weren\u2019t immune to flip-flopping accusations either. During that same election cycle, President Obama was taken to task by the right for his 180-degree turn on gay marriage, his \u201cif you like your plan you can keep it,\u201d remarks, and more. That was then. Now, we have Donald Trump, who sometimes flip-flops mid-speech. Over the space of a few days, he can subscribe to just about every possible position on an issue with few repercussions from the faithful.  For example, in recent discussions of America\u2019s debt, Trump first proposed the \u201cpotentially disastrous policy\u201d that the United States renegotiate its debt payments with foreign creditors. Almost immediately, he walked that back, instead remarking: \u201cI said if we can buy back government debt at a discount \u2013 in other words if interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back at a discount \u2013 if we are liquid enough as a country, we should do that.\u201d  When pressed by critics to explain the economics underpinning his proposals, he simply changed course again, telling CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo: \u201cThis is the United States government. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money. I hate to tell you. So there\u2019s never a default.\u201d   Related: Donald Trump's views are impossible to discern. Why pretend otherwise? | Trevor Timm    The fact that Trump, a supposed business mogul, doesn\u2019t fully grasp international monetary policy is scary enough. But what\u2019s more frightening is that his shifting rhetoric does nothing to erode his support. When John Kerry ran for president in 2004 \u2013 and famously revealed that he was for the Iraq war before he was against it \u2013 his foes even manufactured actual flip-flops for his detractors to wear. Can you see Hillary Clinton giving those out today? Trump supporters would probably wear them as a badge of honor. The website of the pro-Trump Great America Pac proudly trumpets the Washington Post headline \u201cTrump turns to general election \u2013 and away from past positions\u201d on its website. It\u2019s as if Trump\u2019s constant shifts are a feature, not a bug. Some of Trump\u2019s immunity from criticism is shared by the other \u201coutsider\u201d in the race, Bernie Sanders, whose more rabid supporters take umbrage at any disparagement of their candidate. However, unlike Trump, Sanders isn\u2019t a flip-flopper; he is merely saddled with having to defend some positions (like that on guns) that are not always in keeping with his other progressive policies. It\u2019s not as if Sanders spitballs answers, contradicts himself time and again or tells outright lies. Think about the rabbit hole we\u2019ve jumped down: if everything Trump says is true simply by virtue of the fact that he said it, the usual political calculus is out the window. Our last celebrity in the White House, Ronald Reagan, was known as the Teflon President; Trump appears to have done him one better and constructed a Death Star-sized force field that protects him. Probable Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t share any of Trump\u2019s ability to shield herself from accusations of pandering and changing her mind on issues. If anything, there\u2019s a constant scrutiny of her conduct \u2013 from Benghazi to the emails on her private server \u2013 from which Trump also seems immune. Despite Mitt Romney pointing out his failed real estate and casino ventures in a last-ditch attempts to keep Trump from securing the nomination, his lack of actual business acumen hasn\u2019t become a part of the national conversation. That is what\u2019s most disturbing about Trump: he has realized that no longer needs to speak the truth. Trump supporters praise his ability to \u201ctell it like it is\u201d. But that\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing. Often he doesn\u2019t even make sense. Trump has opened a new chapter in American politics when it comes to veracity \u2013 and that door may never close again. Sure, there\u2019s a chance that if, or when, Trump loses, the GOP will regroup and, in 2020, the party will run a more establishment candidate. But there\u2019s as good a chance that a Trumpian \u2013 and to some extent Bernian \u2013 fusion of personality and politics is the beginning of a new normal.  On both sides of the political spectrum, people are tired of \u201ccareer politicians\u201d, those untrustworthy Washington insiders with rock-bottom approval numbers. Combine that with a mainstream media that is often derided for its bias, and it is not a stretch to imagine that a subsequent candidate will also gauge the zeitgeist and conclude it\u2019s best to say whatever works in the moment. If the press criticizes him, then the press lies; if other politicians take him to task, it\u2019s because they are only interested in self-promotion. In this new normal, everyone is a liar \u2013 except your preferred candidate.  If America isn\u2019t careful, the future will allow candidates with no idea how to govern to flip-flop their way straight into the White House.",
