  "body": "On Thursday 21 July, the Global Development Professionals Network will host an afternoon seminar and networking reception alongside the International Aids Conference in Durban, South Africa. The seminar will discuss how we can reach the UNAids 90-90-90 targets by 2030, and ensure that those who have historically been excluded from treatment are not left behind. In association with the International AIDS Society (IAS) and supported by Gilead Sciences, the seminar will look at developments made in HIV/Aids response since 2000, and discuss ways to break down the social barriers to treatment, including:  How can we build environments that support the rights of all, including those historically denied access to HIV treatment, such as sex workers, drug users, and LGBT people?   How do we meaningfully address some of the gender norms that place women and girls at increased risk of HIV?   Whose responsibility is it to ensure countries have what they need to create an environment of universal access to treatment?   How can the lessons of creating universal access to HIV treatment be used to build a lasting legacy of social justice?
