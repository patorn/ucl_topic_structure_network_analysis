But there are no obvious demarcation lines or signs stating you are leaving one sovereign country for another. The bridge between Belcoo in the north and Blacklion in the south is an invisible border. Yet if British Eurosceptics win the referendum on 23 June there are fears that customs and security posts could be re-erected in what was a war zone during the Troubles.  At the Blacklion end, the only hint that you have entered the Irish Republic is the green An Post sign of Ireland\u2019s postal service, unlike the Royal Mail red back in Belcoo.  Inside the busy village store-cum-post office in Blacklion, Dymphna Stewart says she is worried about the dangers of \u201cborders back up\u201d after a Brexit vote. Stewart, who is from across the border in Belcoo in County Fermanagh, believes both villages have gained massively from the freedom of movement the EU guarantees.

People cross over from Belcoo to send parcels to their relatives and friends because it\u2019s cheaper sending abroad with An Post.  \u201cJust imagine if there were security or customs checks on the bridge again. That would be an absolute pain for every business in both villages. Even vehicle checkpoints would be a nuisance and would have an negative impact on the villages,\u201d she says. Across the road from Stewart\u2019s shop-post office is the Market House , a community centre and tourist information office, where a TV screen shows a video promoting the Unesco-protected Global Geopark, the only one in the world to cover two states.  The Market Place received \u20ac1m (\u00a3770,000) to build the centre from the overall \u20ac1.3bn the European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has injected into Ireland, north and south, since 1995 to boost the peace process. Helena Corcoran, a community worker in the centre, which sells souvenir pictures of the nearby Marble Arch caves as well as traditional Gaelic memorabilia such as silver Celtic cross necklaces, crosses her fingers for luck when asked how she thinks the Brexit vote will go. \u201cI just hope sincerely the British people vote to stay in because it will have a bad impact on our lives here in this part of the world if the UK is out of the EU,\u201d she says.     A welcome to Northern Ireland road sign.    She points to the closed businesses on both sides of the bridge and adds: \u201cThe economy is already very fragile here and we need freedom of movement for tourism and visitors in particular. I am not a lover of everything that the EU does but on balance I think both villages have benefited hugely from being inside and getting support from Europe.\u201d European largesse is also evidenced in Belcoo, where in a park overlooking the lough even the display boards charting the geological and political history of the area have an EU funding stamp. That history includes the impact of the 19th-century famine and the fact that the area lost 25% of its population to starvation, disease and emigration. There are more recent, darker, statistics about Belcoo when it was on the frontline of the Provisional IRA\u2019s border campaign between 1969 and 1994. Seven members of the security forces and one Catholic civilian were killed in IRA landmine, remote-controlled bomb and sniper attacks. Many of those murders were carried out by IRA operatives from the southern side of the border. With the Troubles over, barring a few limited terrorist sorties from dissident republicans, the border villages appear at ease with each other.  But on a sunny May afternoon, local historian Harold Johnston remembers the darker times \u2013 and talks of the impact of the border going up in 1921.

When the border came that cut off a large area where the fair days would have stood. All that finished then. There was kind of a collapse there because you hadn\u2019t the same volume of people coming to the fair days or the mart every Saturday.\u201d Johnston, who runs a shop in Blacklion selling an eclectic range of goods from antiques to One Direction T-shirts, also casts his mind back to the Troubles. \u201cThis was the main crossing point at the border. We would have had about 45 guards and five or six sergeants here at the time. There was nobody too pleased about it and nobody too confident about going out at night. Fortunately that\u2019s all gone now.\u201d It remains to be seen whether those who live or work in these two border villages under the shadow of the Cuilcagh mountain will soon be separated once again by a fortified frontier.",
