Related: Elijah Wood: Hollywood\u2019s child sex abuse comparable to Jimmy Savile case    The Lord of the Rings star drew parallels between what was described in the article as a US film industry culture of abuse and the prolific sex attacks carried out by TV host Jimmy Savile in the UK. He said he had been protected as a child \u2013 mainly through the efforts of his mother, who stopped him going to parties \u2013 and revealed many of his peers were regularly \u201cpreyed upon\u201d. \u201cYou all grew up with Savile,\u201d Wood told the Times interviewer. \u201cJesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organised. There are a lot of vipers in this industry \u2013 people who only have their own interests in mind.\u201d \u201cThere is darkness in the underbelly,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you can imagine it, it\u2019s probably happened.\u201d But in a lengthy series of tweets, the actor and producer said his only knowledge of Hollywood paedophilia was drawn from reading articles and viewing the 2015 documentary film An Open Secret, directed by Amy Berg, which deals with the subject.    The Sunday Times interviewed me about my latest film but the story became about something else entirely. It prompted a number of false and\u2014 Elijah Wood (@elijahwood) May 24, 2016      misleading headlines.
