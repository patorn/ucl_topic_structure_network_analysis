  "body": "Several people reacted on Twitter with sarcasm to the research findings of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism about the bulk of the national press favouring Brexit. \u201cDon\u2019t hold the front page,\u201d commented one tweeter. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought\u201d, tweeted another. \u201cNo shit, Sherlock,\u201d said a third, while a fourth remarked: \u201cI think this could be concluded from... er... reading the papers.\u201d They are correct, of course. But rigorous academic research has confirmed an impressionistic viewpoint. Its value, however, is an entirely different matter, as we shall see.   Related: Study confirms that the national press is biased in favour of Brexit    The institute\u2019s final report, which will not be unveiled until September, is likely to show an even greater preponderance of pro-Brexit coverage in the final month of the EU referendum campaign. Take Monday\u2019s newspapers, for example. In varying ways, using a range of different topics \u2013 Steve Hilton\u2019s anti-EU stance, Turkey\u2019s European Union hopes, and, of course migration \u2013 the Brexit pack made their case. The Daily Mail ran a front page piece about the decision by Hilton (\u201cDavid Cameron\u2019s guru\u201d) to declare his Brexit position. And it carried Hilton\u2019s article across a spread, \u201cHow the EU makes Britain impossible to govern.\u201d  The paper registered its joy with Hilton in a leading article that described his viewpoint as a \u201csearingly honest analysis\u201d that puts \u201cthe scaremongering of the Remain camp to shame\u201d. In addition, the Mail ran a further spread on the EU debate plus a page lead about a \u201cstring of Albanian murderers hiding from justice in UK\u201d. One paragraph said:  \u201cLast month justice secretary Michael Gove said about one in 20 of the 10,000 foreign criminals in British jails was from Albania.\u201d   The Daily Express made a somewhat similar point in its leading article:  \u201cIn some parts of the country half of all rape and murder suspects are foreigners and in the country as a whole nearly 20 per cent of crimes are committed by those born outside the UK.\u201d  This, said the paper, is one of \u201cthe terrible problems caused by mass immigration\u201d. And the remedy? \u201cThere can be no better argument for Brexit.\u201d The Daily Telegraph\u2019s editorial, \u201cWe need to talk about immigration\u201d, began by discussing the unlikelihood of Turkey joining the European Union.  It noted that when Michael Gove \u201craised questions about possible Turkish immigration... the Remain campaign accused him of fuelling \u2018prejudice\u2019 [which] depressingly echoes the politics that soured the immigration debate for so many years, when anyone who raised questions about migration was branded racist.\u201d The Telegraph continued:  \u201cVoters with genuine concerns about immigration and its effects - and who are in no way motivated by race - feel marginalised and belittled... Austria, where the far-right Freedom Party has proved so popular, is only the latest EU country to offer a warning of what can happen when the establishment tries to silence and ignore voters\u2019 reasonable concerns about the mass immigration that is an intrinsic part of the European project.\u201d  It hardly needs adding that Boris Johnson\u2019s column amounted to another convoluted plea for a Leave vote.  The Sun took issue with Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, for claiming that Brexit could ruin the health service. His intervention was part of Remain\u2019s Project Fear, it said, and went on to attack the Treasury\u2019s \u201cdodgy dossier claiming the UK would go into recession if the country chooses to leave.\u201d In an adjacent article, Trevor Kavanagh offered \u201cthree reasons\u201d why people should vote Leave: \u201cthe EU is unaccountable, unelected and undemocratic... its dithering leaders are useless at moments of real crisis such as the Balkans conflict and mass immigration... and the euro \u0097\u201dis on the brink of catastrophic meltdown.\u201d But despite such material, and despite the lengthy drip-drip-drip of poison in the national press about the EU over a number of years, opinion polls still suggest Remain will win the vote on 23 June.  Why? Charlie Beckett, director of Polis, the journalism thinktank at the LSE, has argued that \u201cnewspapers are not as powerful as the conspiracy theorists suggest\u201d.  While accepting that the media\u2019s shaping of public attitudes \u201cis a notoriously difficult area for empirical research\u201d, he points out that \u201cthe public say that it is broadcast news and programmes... that give them the best information to make up their mind.\u201d Moreover, Beckett contends (which contradicts my view) that \u201cnewspapers do not determine the broadcasters\u2019 editorial agenda to anything like the degree that their proprietors might hope.\u201d Given the range of media \u2013 print, online and broadcast \u2013 \u201cthe role of newspapers looks increasingly partial and probably minor.\u201d He continues:  \u201cThere may even be a case that the shrill Eurosceptic press might put off voters. Analysis suggests that there are two substantial blocks of voters with pretty settled views.  But of the undecided voters what concerns them most is the risk of leaving. They are not attracted by more extreme statements.  Quoting the hysterical misrepresentations of the facts in a paper like the Express may not be the best persuasive technique for these people. In the face of a frantic press onslaught, it is possible that they are more likely to stick with the status quo.\u201d  Well, I happen to agree with Beckett that the likely outcome will be a Remain victory. And I certainly think the pro-Brexit papers are largely bought and read by people who are largely anti-EU anyway. Preaching to the converted won\u2019t make much, if any, difference. But Beckett\u2019s argument misses at least one important factor: the influence of the press on politicians, which may account for the pressure on Cameron to have made his referendum manifesto pledge.  And that influence is therefore linked to what gets broadcast on news bulletins too. It is part of the agenda-setting process and has an impact beyond the readerships of newspapers, including social media output.  It is fair to ask, as Beckett does, why this relentless Euroscepticism is still not appearing to carry the day. I\u2019m unconvinced by his belief in it being a rejection of the \u201cfrantic press onslaught\u201d. My hunch is that a small \u2018c\u2019 conservatism plays a part along with there being a sizeable number of people aged under 40 -a clich\u00e9d silent majority if you like - who have never been able to see what all thus fuss is about. It is a hunch though, and conceding Beckett\u2019s point about the practical difficulties facing those who seek to study media influence, it is surely necessary to have research offering greater insight than the Reuters Institute one mentioned at the beginning of this piece. Although measuring the quantity of newspaper coverage is all very well, it doesn\u2019t explain a great deal. One has to go deeper to find reasons and then deeper still to discover the effects. For instance, the study reveals that the steadfastly pro-EU Daily Mirror carried fewer articles focused on the referendum than any other paper (bar the irrelevant Daily Star).  Why has coverage been kept to a minimum? Because a large proportion of Mirror readers have made it clear to editors that they favour Brexit. It\u2019s even possible that the majority do. What is required is a sophisticated study into both the public response to the press coverage and a parallel study into the effects of such coverage on broadcasting output. Now that would be of real value.",
