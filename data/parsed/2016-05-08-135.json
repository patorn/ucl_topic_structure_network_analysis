  "body": "Denni Karlsson and I are standing by a glacial river as it hammers through a rocky gorge. Beside us is a wooden crate, the size of an old tea chest. It sits on two slender cables that stretch across the torrent 10 metres below. \u201cThis cableway was the traditional route across the river, part of life in the highlands,\u201d says Denni, who runs horse riding tours of East Iceland from the farmhouse where he now lives with wife Arna Bjarnad\u00f3ttur. \u201cThe last man who farmed here once fell out of it in the middle. He was hauled out unconscious somewhere downstream, but was back at work three days later.\u201d We are in Flj\u00f3tsdalur, an upland valley made famous in the 1930s by novelist Gunnar Gunnarsson, who lived up here. His tales of stoical people battling the elements of ice, water and fire (of the volcanic sort) still ring true today.   Iceland map     Denni tells me that one of his own horses was lost on the high plateau that borders the great ice cap of Vatnajokull for a whole year, and has just been found. I get in the crate and haul myself over the river \u2013 without mishap \u2013 to an abandoned house. I peer in at the old bedstead and table: life was abominably hard here, and people were often forced to leave when their luck turned. An hour later, back at Denni\u2019s home, Arna shows me the Bible they found when they took over the dwelling, which had also been abandoned. \u201cIt\u2019s dated 1728, and we think it was left behind when the volcano, Askja, erupted in 1875. The family emigrated to America.\u201d     Denni and Arna in the traditional longhouse at Fljo\u0301tsdalur    Despite all the departures, however, East Iceland is now experiencing a small but significant return, with people coming back, often to family roots, and finding new ways to make a living, often through tourism. Film-maker Denni was born in East Iceland, but has lived in Rejkjavik and the US. He and Arna are now based here and have built a traditional ba\u0111stofa or longhouse for guests. Their fascinating collection of artefacts and antiques from Flj\u00f3tsdalur history are dotted around. Like many others they believe in slow food and slow tourism: \u201cWe encourage guests to go walking, chat in the kitchen, or just play with the dog.\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy I find all over the area. Many farms use volunteering websites such as helpx.net or workaway.info to bring in visitors who want to stay longer and earn their keep. At one farm they sang the praises of a British student who had just spent a fortnight painting the barn, between making excellent pancakes and doing hill walks.     Fa\u0301skru\u0301\u00f0sfjo\u0308r\u00f0ur waterfall on the road to Egilssta\u00f0ir    The main town in East Iceland is Egilssta\u00f0ir, which made headlines in 2012 when the local council voted to accept the video evidence for a giant Nessie-style monster in their lake. In the Salt Bistro, I chat to Stef\u00e1n Bogi Sveinsson who was president of the council at that time. \u201cI was called on to adjudicate on whether a medieval monster existed,\u201d he says, with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cPeople here are really not far from the old mythology. I voted in favour.\u201d I ask if the renaissance is real, too. \u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d he says. \u201cI moved back here from Reykjavik myself and there are plenty of others. We\u2019ve got this new flight coming in from Gatwick and people are investing in small businesses \u2013 like this bistro.\u201d A spectacular drive over mountains takes me to some of these new, tourism-driven businesses. At Karlssta\u00f0ir, on the shores of Berufj\u00f6r\u0111ur, I find Svavar Eysteinsson and Berglind H\u00e4sler, who manage to be farmers, vegan sausage-makers, guesthouse-owners and Icelandic pop stars. In 2014 their band, Prins P\u00f3l\u00f3, scored a massive hit on the island with the theme tune for the film Paris of the North. Now Svavar is out rounding up sheep for his uncle and Berglind is setting up the ovens for their latest venture: a crowd-funded cottage industry making turnip crisps.     Sey\u00f0isfjo\u0308r\u00f0ur, a beautiful small town of clapboard houses in Norwegian style    \u201cI was worried we would be bored,\u201d says Berglind, \u201cbut in fact we get loads of people dropping in. I don\u2019t think I could ever go back to Reykjavik.\u201d The drive around these fjords is breathtaking. Waterfalls plunge over cliffs into the ocean and crags tickle the clouds. Amid it all there is a winding road and a smattering of red-roofed farms. East of Egilssta\u00f0ir I eventually reach Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, a thriving port that is home to just 650 people and yet manages to support an art school, a cinema, a theatre, restaurants, and bars. It also has several beautifully restored wooden houses, some of which have been converted into the Hotel Aldan. I stay at what was the bank, and eat in a bistro, watching a strange assortment of art students, fishermen and farmers come and go. You could spend a few days here very easily, maybe taking a trip down to Sk\u00e1lanes at the fjord\u2019s mouth, where a field centre-cum-guesthouse lies next to an eider duck colony.     Sk\u00fali J\u00fal\u00edusson on Sn\u00e6fell    Time is limited, however, and next morning I have to meet Sk\u00fali J\u00fal\u00edusson who is going to take me up Sn\u00e6fell \u2013one of several Icelandic mountains that go by this name. It\u2019s the highest peak in the area, and permanently covered in ice. We drive to its base and then set off across a rising slope of volcanic gravel and rock which gets steeper and becomes ice. We attach crampons. The views are increasingly spectacular: delicate veins of shining silver water, marble lava fields patched with golden lichen and emerald green moss. Everything is stark and treeless. At the summit we get a panorama that includes active B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga volcano. We return by the same route to the car. The walk has not been long, but I am a bit cold and agree to Sk\u00fali\u2019s suggestion of a hot shower. So why are we heading into the wilderness? Sk\u00fali chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d     A welcome shower in a hot waterfall after the climb.    At the end of a gravel track we get out and walk. There is grass here and I can see a line of steam rising from the ground. After a few minutes the mystery is revealed: a waterfall in the wilderness that spouts continuously at 38C. It\u2019s miraculous. The nearest thing to it would be to turn on your shower at home, very hot, then leave it running, forever. We soak for an hour in the pool under the falls, until sunset reminds us to leave. I experience a strange sensation: I\u2019m in cornucopia-denial. I need more time in East Iceland.\u2022 The trip was provided by Discover the World (01737 214250, discover-the-world.co.uk) whose seven-night Exploring East Fjords holiday costs from \u00a31,271pp, including return flights from Gatwick to Egilssta\u00f0ir, car hire and B&B accommodation (Snaefell climb \u00a3216pp)",
