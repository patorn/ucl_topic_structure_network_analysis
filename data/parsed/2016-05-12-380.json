  "body": "A four-year-long investigation into an alleged drug murder has resulted in the extradition of an alleged former Bandidos bikie from Serbia. It is one of Australia\u2019s first extraditions of a criminal suspect from that country. Bogdan Cuic has been returned to Brisbane to face court accused of killing Jei \u201cJack\u201d Lee during a cocaine deal in 2012. It follows a prolonged probe during which Cuic slipped the net of surveillance by Serbia\u2019s fugitive squad for almost two years after delays in paperwork provided by police in Australia. Cuic was arrested in June last year and extradited this week with the cooperation of Serbia\u2019s ministry of justice and its courts, despite the country having no extradition treaty with Australia. Queensland homicide squad Acting Inspector Damien Hansen praised the cooperation from Serbia and the efforts of the Australian government and federal police. \u201cThe investigators never gave up,\u201d he said.  \u201cThey got a number of roadblocks in their way because \u2026 there was no extradition treaty with Serbia. \u201cIt was a very difficult murder investigation to begin with and this just adds another level of complexity that I certainly haven\u2019t experienced and it\u2019s the first time we have ever extradited someone from Serbia and the first time I\u2019ve ever been involved in extraditing someone from a country that didn\u2019t have a treaty. \u201cI couldn\u2019t speak highly enough of the cooperation we got from the Serbian federal government agencies.\u201d Police allege Cuic was a member of the Bandidos when he left Australia, the day after Lee\u2019s death in a carpark outside a sushi restaurant in Eight Mile Plains in Brisbane\u2019s south in April 2012. They will allege that Lee was shot in the head during a drug deal in which he was to sell cocaine to Cuic and another man who has also been charged with his murder. Police allege Cuic travelled to Serbia via Thailand. His grandparents months later returned to Serbia after selling their Brisbane home where Cuic had lived with them. Hansen said Serbian police had Cuic under surveillance but \u201che did hide prior to proper authorities being granted and it took another close on two years before he was located again\u201d. \u201cBut [Serbian authorities] continually worked with us. They continually provided resources, I think it was fantastic, the efforts,\u201d he said. Lee\u2019s Taiwanese-born parents were \u201cnaturally \u2026 pleased that two [suspects] have been charged [but] they\u2019re aware it\u2019s the beginning of another long process for the family as it goes through our justice system\u201d. Comment has been sought from the federal attorney general\u2019s office on whether Cuic\u2019s extradition is the first from Serbia to Australia. University of Queensland legal academic Andreas Schloenhardt said while it may not be the first from the Balkan nation, he was not immediately aware of any previous cases. Cuic was due to face Brisbane magistrates court on Thursday where he will be remanded in custody. He would have to apply to the supreme court for bail.",
