  "body": "Wayne Rooney has admitted Manchester United can have no complaints about finishing outside the Champions League berths, with the team managing only 49 goals, the club\u2019s poorest return for 26 years. United beat Bournemouth 3-1 on Tuesday evening, to finish in fifth place on 66 points. This was the same tally as Manchester City but they found the net 71 times \u2013 the most in the division \u2013 and had a superior goal difference of 16 over Louis van Gaal\u2019s side.   Related: Louis van Gaal barracked as Manchester United ease past Bournemouth    United finally closed the Premier League season after the game with Bournemouth was postponed on Sunday after the discovery of a dummy explosive device inside Old Trafford, left behind after a training exercise. Rooney created and scored his team\u2019s opening goal and was instrumental in Marcus Rashford doubling the lead. Ashley Young completed United\u2019s scoring before Chris Smalling\u2019s own goal gave the visitors a consolation. This meant David de Gea missed out on a share of the Golden Glove award for the most clean sheets. Rooney said: \u201cIt is the worst amount of goals since 1990. We haven\u2019t scored enough goals this season. In the Premier League, after 38 games, you finish where you deserve to finish. There are no complaints from us as players. We weren\u2019t good enough to finish in the top four this season and we need to improve on that next season.\u201d Van Gaal named his strongest XI despite having Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final against Crystal Palace to consider. Rooney said: \u201cI think it was important we went out and we played and gave everything to win the game because I know what it\u2019s like when you try and save yourself, contain a bit of energy. That\u2019s when you tend to pick up injuries. We took the game seriously tonight and it showed in the performance. \u201cOf course a club of this size, with this history, we want to be playing in the biggest competition. It is very disappointing not to make it, but we\u2019ve got to pull ourselves together for the game on Saturday. Hopefully we can end the season on a high.\u201d Rooney\u2019s goal was his 18th of the campaign and Rashford\u2019s the eighth in 17 appearances of an impressive debut campaign. On his Instagram account the 18-year-old said: \u201cGood way to end the Premier League season. Looking forward to the FA Cup final on Saturday.\u201d           Manchester United setting sights on FA Cup win, says Louis van Gaal.    Rooney said of the teenager: \u201cHe fully deserves his chance with Man United and now with England and the England squad. I\u2019m sure he will give Roy a difficult decision to make in terms of trying to get into the 23. \u201cI think first of all, which has been great to see, is his attitude for a young lad. He\u2019s come in and he\u2019s listened to the manager and to players. He\u2019s worked hard, he\u2019s got a really good attitude.\u201d Rooney again impressed in a deep-lying midfield berth. The 30-year-old views his future in the position. \u201cI think sometimes you have to make choices in your career, and at the minute it is probably better for me to play deeper,\u201d he said. \u201cNow obviously it is a bit different with England, still being a striker for England. But certainly after that [Euro 2016], for next season, that [midfield] is probably where I see myself playing. \u201cYou\u2019re involved in the game more and I fee like I can dictate games more from there and try and control the tempo of games, which I felt I did quite well.\u201d",
