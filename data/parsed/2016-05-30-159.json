  "body": "The idea of AFC Wimbledon winning promotion, which they will do with victory in the League Two play-off final on Monday, is almost irresistible. Even those who avoid sentimentality will appreciate the appeal of this story: a club formed from the essence of another, which was (at least in their view) stolen from its true home 14 years ago, elevating itself to play alongside those who stole it. Should they prevail, AFC Wimbledon vs MK Dons will be a league fixture for the first time next season. A delicious prospect.   Related: Neal Ardley seeks Hollywood finale for AFC Wimbledon\u2019s remarkable rise | David Conn    But the team they are facing at Wembley have a story to tell, too. Three years ago, Plymouth Argyle survived relegation from the Football League on the last day of the season, relying on results elsewhere to save them after defeat to Rochdale. That was their second successive finish of 21st in the bottom division, the lowest in their history, but in the scheme of things mere poor results on the pitch and the threat of relegation were small fry compared with what had come before. The club very nearly disappeared entirely in 2011, after debts of around \u00a317m led to administrators being appointed, their bank account frozen and players sold off for a fraction of their value. During those straitened times, wages went unpaid and the manager Peter Reid dipped into his own pocket to pay heating bills, even auctioning his FA Cup runners-up medal to raise funds. One man who has been there throughout is club captain Curtis Nelson. The defender became Argyle\u2019s youngest skipper since 1967 when he was given the armband in 2013, aged just 19. Having only just turned 23, through circumstance he has been forced into a position of authority when most his age might be gently learning the game, but now he has experience well beyond his years: the play-off final will be his 246th appearance. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a fitting ending to the dark times at the club,\u201d Nelson says about the prospect of promotion. \u201cWe can put Plymouth back on the map, at least closer to where it should be. I\u2019ve thought about what we\u2019ve been through. Everyone has different reasons behind wanting to be successful, and for me one of the reasons is what I\u2019ve been through with the club.\u201d Plymouth could feel aggrieved that most of the attention could centre on their opponents\u2019 romantic story, but that might turn out to be a benefit. The more focus on Wimbledon, the more pressure they could be under; thus, the reverse could be true for Plymouth. \u201cIf that\u2019s how the neutrals are going to look at it I suppose the onus is on them a little bit,\u201d says Nelson, whose team looked set for automatic promotion until around April. \u201cObviously they\u2019re expected to do big things. But we know we\u2019ve got a lot of support from our fans, and within the club. We\u2019ve sold nearly 35,000 tickets \u2013 that\u2019s a hell of a lot, and the atmosphere is going to be unbelievable.\u201d One curious element to preparing for a play-off final must be the gap between it and the semi. Plymouth secured their place at Wembley on 15 May, meaning they\u2019ve been waiting, like green and white coiled springs, for more than two weeks before the big day. That is in stark contrast to how frantic the rest of the season is; even with early exits from three cup competitions, Plymouth played 53 games over the season, an average of roughly one every five days. Quite a change of pace. With more than a fortnight to kill, it must be tough to get the right balance between ensuring the players get enough rest but preventing rustiness, and by now there must be a sense of wanting to get things started. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cThe gaffer\u2019s looked after us with days off so we\u2019ve not been coming in and wearing ourselves down, giving us a chance to recharge the batteries a bit, mentally and physically.\u201d   Related: The AFC Wimbledon film seems like a curveball \u2013 actually it's an open goal    Not that Nelson has been allowed to put his feet up too much during the break. A few days before the final, he has spent a busy day training, before dealing with the media, collecting club suits for Wembley (\u201cthe lads look good\u201d is his quick sartorial review) plus myriad other responsibilities he has as captain. It is not the sort of thing a 23-year-old usually has to deal with, but given the travails he has endured in his time at Home Park, you get the impression Nelson, like most at Argyle, is grateful they are even around to deal with little problems like this. Of course, the Wimbledon story is seductive, but it is difficult not to side with a man who has been with his club at their absolute nadir and could be on the verge of leading them back to prosperity. \u201cIt will mean more to me,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cIt\u2019s important to win regardless, but for me there\u2019s something personal as well.\u201d",
