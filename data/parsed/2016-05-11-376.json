  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull has set the Coalition up for a head-on collision with the Institute of Public Affairs in the first week of the election campaign by refusing to back down from his proposed super reforms. The conservative thinktank is preparing to unleash an aggressive campaign against the government for its plans to make changes to super taxes and concessions, which the IPA believes will be retrospective. John Roskam, the IPA\u2019s executive director, said on Tuesday the proposals had created an \u201cabsolute firestorm\u201d among Coalition supporters and IPA members and the situation was \u201cdiabolical\u201d for the government.   Related: Today's campaign: finger pointing over Greens preference deals goes on    \u201cWe are going to go as hard on this as we went on the Labor party and media regulation, or Tony Abbott and 18C, or climate change,\u201d Roskam said. But the prime minister has refused to bow to the mounting pressure, saying he will not be making any changes to his super policies. \u201cNo. The super changes are set out in the budget,\u201d he said on Wednesday, on the third day of the election campaign. \u201c[Be] very, very clear. It is not retrospective at all.\u201d He also denied the Liberal party\u2019s deputy leader, Julie Bishop, had hinted at a possible change to the super package in response to the pressure from opponents when she said the government would have a \u201cconsultation period\u201d. \u201cWhat Julie was referring to was the process of consultation that always goes on with changes like this about the technicalities of the drafting [of legislation],\u201d he said. The government\u2019s budget reveals plans to cap tax-free retirement accounts at $1.6m and introduce a $500,000 lifetime cap for all non-concessional super contributions, dated back to 2007. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, and others on the Coalition frontbench have been defending the superannuation package, saying they are not retrospective in nature. Morrison has said the $500,0000 limit on after-tax contributions would only apply from budget night and people who have already contributed more than that will not be asked to withdraw the excess from their accounts.   Related: The 10 big issues of election 2016: how Coalition, Labor and Greens policies compare    Simon Breheny, the IPA\u2019s director of policy, told Guardian Australia the government was being \u201ctoo clever by half\u201d to claim that its measures aren\u2019t retrospective. \u201cOn the $500,000 lifetime limit, they\u2019re taking contributions into account since 2007,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you take into account contributions made between 1 July 2007 and now, or before those changes were announced, that is clearly retrospective.\u201d The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, warned on Wednesday that lots of superannuants were disturbed by the Coalition\u2019s \u201cwrecking ball approach.\u201d \u201cIf you make changes to superannuation it is far preferable that they be prospective in nature and you give warnings to people, rather than in this Morrison and Turnbull frolic,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cThe people who are affected aren\u2019t people likely to vote for Labor but the point is superannuation, and people who have superannuation accounts, are sick and tired of [the] meddling.\u201d",
