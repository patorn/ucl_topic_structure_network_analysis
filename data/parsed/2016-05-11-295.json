It\u2019s a fact that\u2019s covered in a government-led review, released earlier this month, in which workers, employers and customers were asked their views on the tipping process. Off the back of it, ministers said they were keen to change rules and make sure low-paid workers get the money left for them by grateful customers. They have announced a two-month consultation on proposals that the government said would stamp out unfairness. Among the review\u2019s revelations was the fact some waiters are charged up to 15% admin fee on tips they are left by credit or debit cards. In some restaurants, the government has seen evidence of waiters being forced to hand over their own cash if they don\u2019t collect enough tips, to cover these fees. The government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an administration fee or any other deductions.  The government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary, calling for the system to be made more transparent, with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy. We asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether it\u2019s fair), and what would improve it for them.   tips60   Rodri, 37, London: \u2018Around 50% of a waiter\u2019s income is tips\u2019 Average tips: \u00a360 per eight-hour shiftI think they treat waiters best in ... the US  Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed last summer. This is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees. However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. I\u2019ve heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc, for example. Some restaurants will take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs, top up the staff welfare pot and as an admin fee. So if you sell \u00a31,000 worth of food, the company will take \u00a340. This is regardless of how much you make in tips. This means that if a table has a \u00a3100 bill and doesn\u2019t tip the waiter has to pay \u00a34 of their own money. This leads to a money-grabbing culture and, ironically, crap service. If a table doesn\u2019t tip the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers.  I can average around \u00a360 in tips per shift but on a good night this goes up to over \u00a3100 and on a poor night it\u2019s around \u00a340. Around 50% of a waiter\u2019s income is tips. All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure. America has it pretty good, everyone tips.   Tips   Elle, 22, Edinburgh: \u2018We never know whether it\u2019s fair\u2019 Average tips: \u00a320 per eight-hour shiftI think they treat waiters best in ... France I work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality. My main day job is in a cafe where the small number of staff work both front of house and in the kitchen, so all our tips get put in a pot and shared equally. My main evening job is at a restaurant where we don\u2019t get our tips, but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra \u00a32.50 per hour (which apparently has been worked out to account for average tips when shared with the kitchen staff). My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips. In restaurants, because a lot of customers add gratuity through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped \u2013 so we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re getting our fair share or not. The system seems better in France, where they don\u2019t tip much, but waiting tables is seen as a proper job, offering job security and a decent income.   Tips1   Ashley, 22, London: \u2018Tips go towards customer breakages\u2019  Average tips: \u00a310-15 per eight-hour shiftI think they treat waiters best in ... Australia I work in a south-east London pub in the evenings and I do day shifts at a local restaurant. In both places tips are all collected and shared out at the end of the night. Money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breakages by either staff or customers. If a member of the team gets off early they will rarely see their tips because they are shared out before close. It is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team underperforms. Equally when a member of the team does incredibly well they don\u2019t get what they\u2019ve earned. It\u2019s really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers. The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips. I make around \u00a320 a shift, but would only be given \u00a310-15 of that money. When I am tipped well, the tips hugely impact on my finances. Occasionally I will earn over \u00a350 in one night, which almost doubles my earnings for that day. However, I never get more than \u00a330 of that money after it has been shared out. I really rely on tips because I am only paid \u00a37 an hour. I\u2019d rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and therefore didn\u2019t have to rely on tips to make ends meet.   Tips40   Tom, Manchester: \u2018A big night of tips can help make rent\u2019 Average tips: \u00a340 per eight-hour shiftI think they treat waiters best in ... Italy Where I used to work, floor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the bussers and service bar. The 60% went into a tronc system, which helped boost kitchen salaries. I\u2019m not actually sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses. It\u2019s hard to say how much I earned a shift, maybe around \u00a340, \u00a320 from card tips. It can make a massive change to your weekly finances. Sometimes people needed a big night to make rent. Equally you could throw it all away in one night, earning big and then going on a big night out. They have got tipping right in Italy, where people don\u2019t add service charge but usually round up their bill, so if they get a meal for \u20ac19 they leave a \u20ac20 note and don\u2019t ask for change. They respect the staff and you often see people making a career out of waiting, and the experience shows.",
