  "body": "Aah, the campaign trail, where politicians look at many things and have brief conversations with regular people carefully designed to provide exactly the right images for the evening news and allow them to say the things they have already said many times, but in a \u201creal world\u201d context. If having a conversation in front of a phalanx of microphones can be described as \u201creal\u201d. On his first day on the hustings, Turnbull traversed three Brisbane marginal seats (two Liberal National party-held marginals, one Labor) for on-the-ground backdrops to his main positive campaign message \u2013 his tax cuts will help jobs and growth (yesterday themed around companies selling and exporting fruit) and to showcase the budget\u2019s youth unemployment policy (also a counter to Labor\u2019s attack that the Coalition is only interested in the \u201ctop end of town\u201d).   Related: Stop the votes! An address from the prime minister of Canberra | Tom Ballard    One stumble, or a vocal opponent, or an unfortunate photographic juxtaposition, and the images become the \u201cgaffe\u201d of the day. Turnbull\u2019s first day contained no such gaffe. Bursting out of the blocks at 7am, having no doubt digested polling showing him either narrowly in front (Ipsos) or narrowly behind (Newspoll), Turnbull was deliberately conveying the confidence of a bloke who was destined to win, striding into the Brisbane markets (a regular stop for prime ministerial candidates as it\u2019s in the marginal seat of Moreton, now held by Labor\u2019s Graham Perrett by 1.6%) apparently intent upon persuading everyone in his path that it was a very exciting time to be a purveyor of fruit. Trailing behind as part of an eye-catching media contingent in hi-vis vests it is impossible to catch every word but you get the gist. Turnbull\u2019s opening question was often \u201cHow\u2019s business?\u201d, his follow-up response usually involved the company tax cut plan. \u201cWe are backing business. We are right behind you \u2026 that\u2019s what our company tax cut is all about\u201d and variations of words to that effect. It was a message generally well received on his markets walk-through with the LNP candidate Nic Monsour, brother in law of former Queensland premier Campbell Newman. Ian Bensted of the Wholesale Fruit Company said Turnbull asked him how business was. \u201cI told him the company tax cut was a pretty good place to start.\u201d Turnbull told salesman Ethan Kelly, 24, at JE Tipper (who does \u201ceverything from bananas through to custard apples\u201d) about his university job packing bananas during a short chat. It was, Kelly declared, the best thing that has happened to him, at least the best thing \u201cthat I can talk about on film\u201d. Turnbull returned to his youthful fruit experience in a later chat around a large bin full of watermelons \u2013 one of which he was persuaded to sample by a fellow called Alfie. \u201cI started work with a banana merchant and ended up working for a watermelon guy\u2026 carting watermelons on and off trucks certainly builds your arms up,\u201d he said.   Related: Mother's Day was Turnbull's day \u2013 at least that's what Peta Credlin thinks | Amanda Meade    Along the way he met John Hunter, brandishing a photo of himself with Turnbull from a visit Turnbull made to the markets in 2013. \u201cI said back then you can sign it for me when you come back as prime minister,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cAnd he just did.\u201d There was discussion of the the opportunities for produce exports to China \u2013 \u201cAs that Chinese middle class grows they will want to know exactly where everything they eat is coming from\u201d Turnbull said \u2013 and the benefits for exporters from the government\u2019s new free-trade agreements. And then Turnbull encountered a fruit seller who responded to Turnbull\u2019s \u201cwe\u2019re backing business \u2026 we are right behind you\u201d lines by declaring \u201cwe want you as prime minister forever\u201d.  Despite that image being as good as a prime ministerial minder could hope for, the buses rolled northwards to the Coalition\u2019s most marginal seat of Petrie, held by Luke Howarth by a slim 0.5%. The campaign banter hit a slightly awkward snag as Turnbull was introduced to two young people at Help employment, a jobs series provider, who were both temporarily dumbstruck when he asked them how they were going in front of the pack of media and minders. \u201cI know you\u2019re a bit nervous, I\u2019m a bit nervous too with all these microphones,\u201d he encouraged, before explaining the budget\u2019s new youth unemployment scheme under which the government will pay businesses $1,000 to take on young, unemployed people as interns for up to 12 weeks and how those interns will receive $200 on top of their fortnightly welfare payments. \u201cThe days when people had the same job for life are gone\u2026 so it\u2019s about making sure you are employable,\u201d Turnbull said, ostensibly to the jobseekers. In fact the young jobseekers were already favourably disposed to the plan, which replaces Tony Abbott\u2019s work for the dole scheme \u201cI was on work for the dole and I guess it\u2019s an OK idea if it gets people who aren\u2019t doing anything into something but I don\u2019t think it really helped me find a job,\u201d Jake Woolnough, 22, told Guardian Australia later. \u201cI think these traineeships are much better than just volunteering. \u201cI wish I\u2019d said it like that. I\u2019d planned what I wanted to say but I was very nervous.\u201d   Related: Poll of polls: who will win the Australian election?    After a press conference in front of the new campaign signage (\u201cBack the Turnbull Coalition team\u201d, \u201cBack a strong new economy\u201d) in which he was asked some off-script questions on climate change (he alleged Bill Shorten had given up Australia\u2019s negotiating leverage in future climate negotiations by announcing a higher reduction target but admitted Australia would have to adopt a higher reduction target) it was off to campaign backdrop No 3 and a bit more fruit. Grove Juice, a fruit processor and juice exporter, already exports to Japan, South Korea and Malaysia and is confident of cracking the Chinese market soon.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had Chinese supermarkets here, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said founder Greg Willis, who employs more than 100 at this plant in the marginal electorate of Conner, held by the Liberals\u2019 Ross Vasta by 3.7%. Willis has built a new factory outside of Brisbane and intends to move his entire operation there within two years, leaving marketing, distribution and head office at the Brisbane site. Beside Willis was Dick Estens, a cotton farmer and now citrus farmer who provides the company with its fruit. It took a few moments to place him as also the author of the \u201cEstens report\u201d for the Howard government in 2002 into the proposed sale of Telstra. Turnbull arrived for another round of handshaking and questions posing as opportunities to deliver his message \u2013 \u201cThe enthusiasm in those big Asian markets for our clean green products is enormous isn\u2019t it,\u201d he observed. \u201cAs you know those tax cuts we are rolling out\u2026 you\u2019ll get the benefit of them over time.\u201d \u201cSo long as you win the election,\u201d Estens replied. And with that, the prime minister\u2019s national tour of \u201creal world\u201d backdrops completed its final day unscathed. Only 54 to go.",
