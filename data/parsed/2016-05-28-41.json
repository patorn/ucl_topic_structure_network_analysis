  "body": "New Orleans Pelicans shooting guard Bryce Dejean-Jones has died aged 23. Police say he was fatally shot after breaking down the door to a Dallas apartment. Sr Cpl DeMarquis Black said in a statement that officers were called early Saturday morning and found the 23-year-old Dejean-Jones collapsed in an outdoor passageway. He was taken to a hospital where he died. Black says a person living at the apartment was asleep when he heard his door kicked open. The man retrieved a handgun and fired when Dejean-Jones began kicking the bedroom door. The Pelicans declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding his death, but said in a statement: \u201cIt is with deep sadness that the Pelicans organization acknowledges the sudden passing of Bryce Dejean-Jones. We are devastated at the loss of this young man\u2019s life who had such a promising future ahead of him. Our thoughts and prayers are with Bryce\u2019s family during this difficult time.\u201d Dejean-Jones was born and raised in Los Angeles. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear why he was in Dallas. \u201cBryce overcame a lot of obstacles to get to this point in his career,\u201d his agent Scott Nichols said. \u201cHe was a joy to be around, a talent just turning the corner in his career.\u201d Dejean-Jones signed with the Pelicans as an undrafted free agent out of Iowa State. He spent time at three colleges \u2013 USC, UNLV, and Iowa State \u2013 averaging 10.8 points per game over four seasons. Dejean-Jones was waived by the Pelicans in October but was re-signed to back-to-back 10-day contracts two months later. He signed a two-year deal with the Pelicans in February and finished his rookie season having averaged 5.6 points and 3.4 rebounds in 14 games. \u201cThis is a very, very sad and tragic day for everyone that\u2019s a part of the Cyclone basketball family,\u201d Iowa State coach Steve Prohm said. Former Cyclones coach Fred Hoiberg added in a statement that Dejean-Jones was a \u201cpassionate and talented player that lived out his dream of playing in the NBA through hard work and perseverance.\u201d",
