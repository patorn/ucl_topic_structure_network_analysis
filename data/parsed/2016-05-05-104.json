  "body": "Inside Stade Velodrome, the home of French football club Olympique de Marseille, G\u00e9rard Depardieu is hunched over a table, snorting a prodigious line of cocaine. Satisfied, he strolls out towards the pitch, looks out over the ground and its roaring supporters and declares, \u201cI fucking love this city\u201d. It\u2019s an understandable statement. He has been the mayor of it for 20 years. Welcome to Marseille, a drama of political intrigue, corruption and gang warfare, all dusted with a light coating of coke. The eight-part series is Netflix\u2019s first European production, an attempt to grab a slice of the subtitled drama pie and establish a foothold in mainland Europe.  As is Netflix\u2019s fashion, they\u2019ve thrown both money and big names at the project. Marseille was created by Dan Franck (novelist and writer of Carlos, the hit miniseries and film about Venezuelan revolutionary Carlos the jackal), exec-produced by Florent Siri (best known as the director of Bruce Willis action flick Hostage), and stars established French actors like G\u00e9raldine Pailhas and Beno\u00eet Magimel. And then there\u2019s Depardieu, a singular character in French culture: one of their most recognisable artistic exports, but also no stranger to controversy, and currently a Russian citizen, having disavowed his French citizenship after an argument over tax. In Marseille, he plays a figure just as larger-than-life: mayor Robert Taro. As the show opens, Taro is planning his last great project, a regeneration of Marseille\u2019s marina that will see a huge casino placed at its centre, before handing over the reins to his oleaginous protege, Lucas Barr\u00e8s. But just as he\u2019s preparing for retirement, Barr\u00e8s betrays him by casting the deciding vote against the project, prompting Taro to run for office once more.     Betrayed by his protege ... Robert Taro (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) with Lucas Barr\u00e8s (Beno\u00eet Magimel). Photograph: David Koskas/Netflix    Franck says the part of Taro was written with Depardieu in mind. \u201cDepardieu has the body to really embody this character,\u201d he explains at a Netflix event. Certainly his hefty frame and heftier reputation feels a good fit for the imposing figure. Yet Depardieu is given second billing to what Siri declares the show\u2019s \u201cmain character\u201d: Marseille itself. France\u2019s second city has always had, like Naples and Liverpool, a heavily romanticised outsider status, which attracted the creators.  \u201cIn a way it\u2019s not very French because it\u2019s a harbour,\u201d says Siri. \u201cSo you have some Spanish, some Italian, some people from North Africa and the Mediterranean culture too. It\u2019s really a crossing.\u201d The series frequently shifts the lens away from intrigue in the town hall to show this \u201ccrossing\u201d of cultures throughout the city, with storylines taking in organised crime in the city\u2019s more impoverished areas. \u201cThe Quartier Nord, the bad area of Marseille, is [near] the centre,\u201d Siri continues. \u201cYou also have a very bourgeois area, and a harbour industry \u2013 so it\u2019s a fantastic theatre of passion and emotion. When there are tense situations, tense moments, Marseille reacts like she\u2019s alive.\u201d     The slick, well-coiffed modern politico Barr\u00e8s. Photograph: Netflix/David Koskas    But whether the city can maintain that personality is up for debate. Siri says his show illustrates a \u201cfight\u201d between the old Marseille and the new, reflected by the battle between the slick, well-coiffed modern politico Barr\u00e8s and the old-world politician Taro. Indeed, Franck says that Taro represents \u201cthe noble side of politics.\u201d So why the powdery introduction? \u201cThere\u2019s a widespread hypocrisy in Europe when it comes to drugs,\u201d says Franck. \u201cWe know that political personalities do drugs. We used it as a way to discuss the drugs problem, not only to talk about cocaine but all these other types of drugs, and also the ones in the poor neighbourhoods.\u201d \u201cWe present him as a bad guy at the start, sniffing coke,\u201d adds Siri. \u201cBut you see after that he\u2019s the opposite. He\u2019s not the cliche of the corrupt politician \u2013 he fights for the city, he\u2019s in love with the city, more than with his family.\u201d Marseille\u2019s creators struggle to show the same level of passion for the current state of French politics, a situation Franck describes as \u201cimmensely disappointing\u201d. As confidence in mainstream politicians fades across Europe, and anti-Islamic sentiment builds in the wake of the November Paris attacks, nationalism is on the rise, most notably in France, where Marie Le Pen\u2019s Front National party continues to pick up support. Franck is horrified by the sudden lurch towards nationalist politics.     \u2018It\u2019s a fantastic theatre of passion and emotion\u2019 \u2026 Marseille shows all sides of the city, from the town hall to the banlieue. Photograph: David Koskas/Netflix    \u201cIt\u2019s not a social Europe\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not united either, and we can see that with the crisis in migration. Everybody\u2019s trying to protect their own boundaries and borders. This nationalism is something I find scary. It\u2019s why I\u2019m against Brexit.\u201d In France, the show has not attracted a united front from critics. \u201cIn refined language, this would be called an industrial accident. More colloquially, this is cowshit,\u201d wrote Le Monde critic Pierre Serisier. The poor notices for Marseille prompted one of the heads of the show\u2019s production house to declare that it was only Parisian critics who didn\u2019t like it. Certainly, Marseille has its rough edges, and lacks the style and nuance of another recent French political series, the excellent Baron Noir. But there is something engaging about the amped-up, coke-snorting drama of Marseille\u2019s better moments. It feels brash and loud and flawed, but not without its charms \u2013 much like its titular city and, of course, its leading man.  Marseille is available on Netflix now.",
