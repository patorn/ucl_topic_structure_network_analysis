  "body": "Culture secretary John Whittingdale has been forced to concede that he will \u201cdo nothing to undermine\u201d the independence of the BBC following a barrage of criticism from MPs. Whittingdale was accused by shadow culture secretary, Labour MP Maria Eagle, of trying to turn the corporation into a \u201cmouthpiece of the government of the day\u201d following reports that a majority of members of the new BBC board would be government appointed. Whittingdale said the white paper would do nothing to change the pre-budget funding deal reached with the government last year, and indicated that the BBC would not be ordered where to schedule its most popular entertainment programmes, such as Strictly Come Dancing, to avoid competing with commercial rivals.   Related: BBC white paper could spark revolt among Conservative MPs    \u201cI have no wish to hobble the BBC,\u201d Whittingdale said. Asking an urgent question after prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, a day before the publication of the government\u2019s white paper on the future of the corporation, Eagle accused Whittingdale of \u201cdisplaying seemingly implacable hostility to the BBC during the charter renewal process\u201d. Eagle said reports that the government wanted to appoint the majority of the BBC board\u2019s members amounted to government control of its editorial decision-making process and would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for its reputation in the UK and around the world. She was joined in her concerns by MPs including former Conservative home secretary Kenneth Clarke, the SNP\u2019s John Nicholson and Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who said Whittingdale would have \u201cthe fight of his life on his hands if there is any suggestion whatsoever of anything that intrudes on the BBC\u2019s independence\u201d. Whittingdale said he was \u201ccommitted to the editorial independence of the BBC\u201d and added in its proposals for the new BBC board \u201cwe have taken steps to ensure the independence of the BBC is beyond doubt\u201d.  In one of several references later during exchanges in the Commons, he added: \u201cI have always made clear the editorial independence of the BBC is incredibly important and we will do nothing to undermine that ... We have done our best to strengthen it in some areas.\u201d Eagle said Whittingdale \u201cdidn\u2019t like the results of the public consultation [on the future of the BBC] so he is simply ignoring them. The public loves the BBC and wants it to carry on doing what it has been doing for 90 years. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late for the secretary of state to start listening to the public,\u201d she added. \u201cIf he continues on this path \u2026 it will lead to the destruction of the BBC as a much-loved broadcaster and turn it into a mouthpiece of the government of the day.\u201d In an unlikely reference to Thomas the Tank Engine in response to another MP\u2019s question, he added: \u201cI have no ambition to become the fat controller.\u201d Whittingdale also denied that the corporation would be ordered to avoid scheduling clashes, such as that which regularly happens between Strictly Come Dancing and ITV\u2019s The X Factor. The SNP\u2019s Nicholson, a former BBC news presenter, asked Whittingdale to confirm that the BBC would not be required to show \u201conly dull, unpopular programmes at certain times of the day\u201d.  The culture secretary offered a one-word reply: \u201cYes.\u201d   Related: Salaries of top BBC stars could be made public under government plans    Following reports that the licence fee could be top-sliced to fund commercial rivals in areas such as children\u2019s TV, Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: \u201cWe were under the impression last July that the secretary of state had come to an agreement with the BBC [that there would be] no top-slicing.\u201d Whittingdale replied: \u201cI can say to the honourable gentleman that the agreement we reached with the BBC stands and nothing in the white paper will change that.\u201d Tory MP Damian Green said greater government interference in the BBC would be a \u201chugely retrograde step\u201d. Whittingdale said: \u201cI am absolutely in agreement about the importance of editorial independence. In terms of the appointment process [to the new BBC board], the BBC Trust were entirely appointed by the government, as indeed were the BBC governors before them. \u201cHowever, the BBC board is a different beast and I hope he will find we have taken steps to ensure the independence of the BBC is beyond doubt.\u201d Whittingdale also said the issue of diversity \u2013 championed by actor and comedian Lenny Henry \u2013 would be \u201ccentral to the white paper\u201d.",
