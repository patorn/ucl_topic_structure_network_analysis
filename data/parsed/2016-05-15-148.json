  "body": "From the female lawyers and vicars who are asked: \u201cNothing personal, but is a man available instead?\u201d, to the one in five lesbian, gay and bisexual people who report being homophobically bullied at work, discrimination \u2013 whether it is based on race, gender or sexuality \u2013 is not as uncommon as you might think. And it becomes even more difficult to manage if your boss is the one discriminating against you. \u201cIf you have a mentor, it\u2019s a good idea to speak to them so they can act as someone to talk to outside of your team. You may find they have experienced something similar and may be able to offer you practical advice,\u201d says Penny de Valk, managing director of Penna Talent Practice. There are also legal considerations. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal for a company to directly treat you unequally because of your race, sex, disability, religion or sexual orientation,\u201d explains employment lawyer Philip Landau.
