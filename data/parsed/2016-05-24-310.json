The star of The Fall and The X-Files expressed her desire to take over from Daniel Craig as the world\u2019s most famous secret agent, tweeting, alongside the poster: \u201cIt\u2019s Bond, Jane Bond.\u201d She added: \u201c(And sorry, don\u2019t know who made poster but I love it!)\u201d, with the hashtag #NextBond.    It's Bond. Jane Bond. Thanks for all the votes!

Others in the running to play the spy in the next 007 film include actor and DJ Idris Elba and Homeland star Damian Lewis. But Anderson\u2019s suggestion that she wants the role sent Twitter into a frenzy.    IM GOING TO SELL MY SOUL TO SATAN FOR GILLIAN AS THE FIRST FEMALE BOND HAPPEN\u2014 vale (@r4ulsonfeels) May 21, 2016      @GillianA OK BUT ALSO IDRIS ELBA CAN BE JAMES BOND AND YOU CAN BE JANE BOND AND YOU CAN SLAY EVERYONE\u2014 charlotte\u2728 (@bensonscully) May 21, 2016      @felishacarolle And now that someone has put the idea out there...GIVE ME A FEMALE BOND STAT!  And give me a female Bourne too! \ud83d\udc4a\u2014 Kelley Sublett (@Kel_Sub) May 22, 2016      .@GillianA pic.twitter.com/4z4KdjPCRO\u2014 Ryan Love (@RyanJL) May 21, 2016    Last week it was reported that Craig had turned down \u00a360m to make two more films with the franchise. However, reports later said he was yet to make a decision on his future as Bond. Despite that, it is widely believed Craig wants to move on after four outings as 007. Hiddleston, who played spy Jonathan Pine in the Night Manager, has played down speculation that he would take on the role, recently telling the BBC\u2019s Graham Norton Show: \u201cThe position isn\u2019t vacant as far as I\u2019m aware. No one has talked to me about it. \u201cI think the rumours have come about because in the Night Manager I play a spy and people have made the link.\u201d Meanwhile Elba, who starred in Luther, has spoken of being weary of the constant speculation. \u201cI\u2019m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I\u2019ve not even played the role,\u201d he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2015. \u201cEnough is enough. I can\u2019t talk about it any more.\u201d",
