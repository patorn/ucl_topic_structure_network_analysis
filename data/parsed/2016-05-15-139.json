  "body": "Senior Church of England clergy must undergo systematic retraining to deal properly with disclosures of sexual abuse amid continuing concern that survivors are being ignored, sidelined or intimidated, bishops are to be told next week. An action plan drawn up by Sarah Mullally, the bishop of Crediton, is also expected to propose that local autonomy on safeguarding issues be reduced in favour of a consistent response which meets nationally determined standards. Mullally\u2019s report will be presented to the House of Bishops, which will hold a private meeting in York next week. Two months ago, she was tasked by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, with drawing up a plan to implement recommendations of an independent inquiry into the way the church handled the case of \u201cJoe\u201d. Over four decades, senior church figures failed to act on Joe\u2019s repeated disclosures of his abuse. Survivors who have been consulted by Mullally and her team have expressed confidence in the bishop\u2019s determination to improve the church\u2019s response to abuse disclosures. But they have also voiced fears that the House of Bishops might be reluctant to acknowledge the extent of the failures and accept the need for radical action.   Related: Damning report reveals Church of England's failure to act on abuse    \u201cDespite promises to change, they have done little,\u201d said Joe, whose identity is known to the Guardian. \u201cThis crucial House of Bishops\u2019 assembly gives them an opportunity to repent and swiftly change their structures, and make their response to survivors safe at last. Their mirage is finished. They must surely recognise this finally.\u201d Phil Johnson of Macsas, an organisation that supports survivors of sexual abuse in the church, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that Sarah Mullally recognises that the church is at a tipping point, but actions speak louder than words. It\u2019s very difficult to get real change through the House of Bishops.\u201d The independent inquiry into Joe\u2019s case, led by safeguarding expert Ian Elliott, made 11 recommendations, including a new training programme \u2013 particularly for senior clergy \u2013 on receiving, recording and acting on disclosures.  In the case of Joe, who told three bishops and a senior clergyman later ordained as a bishop about his abuse, Elliott said: \u201cThose that received the disclosures \u2026 did not manage that situation appropriately. No available records were created by anyone \u2026 no action was taken.\u201d He also said the church\u2019s national safeguarding team should have the power and responsibility to intervene in dioceses where necessary. \u201cThe lack of authority and responsibility at the centre is viewed as an important deficit in this case.\u201d However, the C of E\u2019s 108 bishops in 42 dioceses strongly defend their local autonomy. \u201cBishops are very protective of their fiefdoms. They will resist any move they see as an attack on their independence,\u201d said a senior member of the clergy. Johnson said the independence of each diocese was part of the problem. \u201cThe church really needs to tackle and modernise its archaic structures to ensure more accountability,\u201d he said. According to Joe: \u201cBishops need to relinquish a lot of authority and be much more open to scrutiny.\u201d He added: \u201cIf they make the right choices, the church will change very significantly \u2013 and it needs to.\u201d Although Mullally and the national safeguarding team are pressing for action to improve the church\u2019s response to sexual abuse disclosures, they acknowledge that change is likely to take longer than survivors would wish. \u201cNot everyone sings from the same hymn sheet on this,\u201d a church source said. A decision on whether to accept Mullally\u2019s plan may be deferred until September. Another high-profile survivor of clerical sexual abuse has refused to cooperate with an independent review ordered by the church into his case because he says the \u201cbullying and silencing\u201d he experienced as a result of his disclosures is not included in the inquiry\u2019s remit. Graham Sawyer, a C of E vicar, was abused by Peter Ball, a former bishop of Lewes and Gloucester, who was jailed for 32 months last October for offences against 18 boys and young men in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Following Ball\u2019s trial, the church ordered an independent inquiry led by Dame Moira Gibb to examine the church\u2019s response to disclosures of the former bishop\u2019s abuse. The church has been accused of failing to act to bring Ball to justice when accusations first surfaced in 1993. \u201cFor me and for many other survivors there are two crimes. One is what Peter Ball did to me and others. But the other \u2013 and it endures \u2013 is the terrible way that the Church of England at its highest levels continues to treat us. And therefore if this review \u2026 doesn\u2019t include that bullying and vilification, then it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on,\u201d Sawyer previously told the BBC Sunday programme. A Cof E spokesperson said: \u201cThe House of Bishops takes all safeguarding work very seriously and it is a standing item on the agenda. Bishop Sarah Mullally is working closely with the national safeguarding team to implement the recommendations of the Elliott review, and she will be presenting key messages on this to the House at its meeting this month.\u201d Mullally had offered an unreserved apology for \u201cthe failings of the church towards [Joe]\u201d when she received Elliott\u2019s report on behalf of the C of E in March, the spokesperson added.",
