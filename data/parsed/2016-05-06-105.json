  "body": "Poor Gavin Andresen. First he publicly backs Craig Wright, saying that the Australian computer scientist really is the man who created bitcoin under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Then, when Wright\u2019s own promised evidence falls apart \u2013 utterly disintegrates, really, faster than a tissue left in your pocket when you wash a pair of jeans on the spin cycle \u2013 he can only respond \u201cwhat the heck?\u201d On Thursday, it became clear that Wright wasn\u2019t even going to try to provide any other evidence, and Andresen started mulling platitudes, tweeting: \u201c\u2018we are all Satoshi\u2019 is such a lovely idea; might say \u2018yes\u2019 when asked \u2018are you?\u2019\u201d Now, it looks like Andresen might have just been fired from Bitcoin development. He took over development of the Bitcoin code from Nakamoto himself when the latter retired from the scene, but since then he has also taken a back seat, leaving others to do the heavy lifting. One of those others, Wladimir van der Laan, wrote on Friday  that Andresen\u2019s ability to make changes to the main code running bitcoin has been revoked. \u201cWhen we saw the blog post convinced he found Satoshi, the prudent thing to do was to revoke his ownership of the \u2018bitcoin\u2019 organization on github, under which the Bitcoin Core repository currently lies, immediately,\u201d van der Laan wrote. \u201cIn the past he has stated that \u2018Satoshi can have write access to the github repo any time he asks\u2019, so if he is absolutely convinced that this is Satoshi, there is a risk that he\u2019d give away the repository to a scammer,\u201d he added. There\u2019s a lot more politics under the surface of the decision, related to a major battle for the future of the currency. But for now, it looks like Andresen\u2019s role is reduced to \u201clargely ceremonial\u201d.",
