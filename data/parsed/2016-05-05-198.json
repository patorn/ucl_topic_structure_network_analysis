  "body": "Here endeth the 44th parliament. As chaotic as the 43rd. Not hung. Two prime ministers. First term of government. Twenty-two politicians are retiring.  The former Labor minister and sometime Rudd numbers man Alan Griffin gave his assessment of walking out the door after 23 years. \u201cI feel a bit like one of the characters in The Shawshank Redemption,\u201d he said.  \u201cI am just about to be de-institutionalised after 23 years. The question will be can I cross the road, am I going to be able to do basic tasks?\u201d   Related: Budget 2016: Bill Shorten unveils $71bn in savings over 10 years    In the prison drama The Shawshank Redemption, Morgan Freeman\u2019s character was forced to lick shit off a prison guard\u2019s boots. Griffin said he hoped to be able to drag himself through \u201cacres of excrement\u201d to transition to real life.  Funny thing is that Griffin\u2019s assessment reflects the public\u2019s view of the parliament at the moment. As my local butcher said, when asked last week who he thought would win a July 2 election, \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d The day began with news of Tony Abbott\u2019s admission that early in his career he had once been offered $5000 in an envelope by a \u201cwell-known millionaire\u201d. He rang Bill Heffernan to ask advice. \u201cOnce bought, always bought,\u201d said Bill. Get him to make a cheque out to the party. Heffernan was in a mood to mess with minds. He ended his last parliamentary day calling on the attorney general to establish a federal corruption watchdog. He was reflecting public opinion.  But so much else in the day did not.  Valedictories continued as did a series of long-form prime ministerial interviews. We learned the government had modelled the cost of the 10-year corporate tax cuts but Malcolm wasn\u2019t telling.  By question time, Labor was fired up, pursing the Coalition over the cost. Whenever treasury matters are debated, the former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan can barely contain his three-year outrage. The Leader of the House, Christopher Pyne, stopped proceedings to say Swan was \u201cswearing disgracefully, shouting profanities at the prime minister\u201d.  \u201cI\u2019m happy to write the word down for you and hand it to you Mr Speaker,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will not put it on the Hansard and give him the respect that he\u2019s looking for to have that remark repeated.\u201d Question time was cut short by a suspension of standing orders by Labor\u2019s Chris Bowen, who was hoarse before he started. He was of a mind to welcome the usual government gag, so when Pyne agreed to allow the debate the shadow treasurer had to launch into a stump speech. Pyne ducked behind the Speaker\u2019s chair, clearly delighted, only to emerge from the other side, jeering Labor from their own side. Bowen \u2013 drowning not waving. Pyne moved an extension, making the hoarse MP press on.    Related: Want to understand budget week? It's all about the election pitches | Lenore Taylor    Malcolm Turnbull stayed for Labor\u2019s suspension, not something that Tony Abbott often did. He delivered his speech to the camera. It was hard to tell whether he playing a statesman or statue.  Labor\u2019s Tony Burke was better prepared than Bowen. He thought he\u2019d ask for an extension of time for Turnbull but he was sure the government\u2019s own backbench would kill him. Bill Shorten\u2019s budget reply promised to block the retrospective measures in the budget for superannuation, dump the tax cuts for medium and big business and crack down on loans for private training providers. He invoked the 2006 Beaconsfield mine disaster to reflect the nation\u2019s courage. But the subtext was to remind voters of a simpler picture of Shorten sitting in the cold by a mine pit. Not the shadowy figure on a mobile phone in a suburban Chinese on Canberra spill night. He ended with his pitch.  \u201cIn 58 days, you will have your say on who governs the country for the next three years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might be the underdogs in this election but we have never sought to be a small target. We have learned the hard lessons of the past. We have put forward our positive plans. We are united. We are ready.\u201d In 2006 Kim Beazley called him the \u201cinterpreter of Australia\u201d for tapping into the national feeling. In the intervening years, he was often speaking another language. Every month he gets a little clearer. You could call it the Shorten Redemption. But Australians have seen finely honed messages before. None better than Turnbull. Australians are waiting for a political transition. A new politics \u2013 promised but not yet delivered. The last thing they want is the same old shit.",
