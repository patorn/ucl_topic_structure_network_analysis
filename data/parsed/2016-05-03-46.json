  "body": "Last autumn I got chatting to a man in a waiting area at a local Bupa hospital. He\u2019d recently arrived in Leicester from Rome and was interested in knowing places to visit in and around the city. I suggested he take the open-top bus tour of Leicester which I had found very useful when friends from abroad had visited. He made a note of it and said he would. I found out later that he was Claudio Ranieri, Leicester City\u2019s manager. I guess he will be taking an open-top bus tour of the city now. Adding my congratulations to the rest of the world\u2019s adulation \u2013 well done, Foxes! Well done, Claudio!Rosy CurtisQueniborough, Leicestershire \u2022 By all means evoke the name of Richard III in connection with Leicester City\u2019s gloriously improbable triumph in the Premier League (Front page, 3 May) but do not overlook the king who gave his name to the place, King Lear. Crookback Dick went to Leicester only to be buried after losing the top-of-the-table clash with Lancaster at Bosworth Field, but Lear lived in Lear-cester. And if you decide to divide your kingdom in three, a city at the geographical centre of the country is a good place to start.Michael Cole (Former director of Fulham Football Club), Laxfield, Suffolk \u2022 Collecting my Guardian I and others were struck by your front page \u2013 in a class above all others. Thank you and to conclude with lines before the battle: \u201cSoft I did but dream \u2026 the lights burn blue.\u201dAngus MacIntoshBurley in Wharfedale, West Yorkshire \u2022 Several years ago on the radio, the bishop of Leicester said he always introduced himself as the Bishop of Leicester City Nil. I wonder how he would introduce himself today. Any suggestions?Paul GleaveGolborne, Greater Manchester \u2022 Delighted as I am about Leicester City\u2019s deserved success, I recall that in 2002 the club went into administration leaving a mountain of debts including those to local ambulance services. Is it too much to hope that the present owners might use some the forthcoming riches to\u00a0redeem those debts?Tony WardLoughborough, Leicestershire \u2022 In all the euphoric coverage of Leicester\u2019s triumph, I have seen no mention of Ipswich Town\u2019s even more unexpected Championship in 1962, in their first season in the top division. They beat the double-winning Spurs in two of the most exciting games I\u2019ve ever seen. But I suppose football only really began in 1992\u2026Mike HeathSouthbourne, West Sussex  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
