Trump needed a majority 1,237 delegates out of the 2,472 at stake to tie up the nomination in advance of the Republican national convention in Cleveland in July. The nomination will not officially be conferred until the convention. Trump was boosted over the line on Thursday by a group of unbound and previously uncommitted delegates who decided to board the Trump train, the Associated Press reported. Recent converts to the Trump camp included the Oklahoma GOP chairwoman, Pam Pollard. \u201cI think [Trump] has touched a part of our electorate that doesn\u2019t like where our country is,\u201d Pollard told AP. \u201cI have no problem supporting Mr Trump.\u201d Senior party officials such as Pollard are among 118 delegates who will enter the convention unbound \u2013 they may vote for whomever they want to be the party\u2019s nominee. The vast majority of Republican delegates are bound by state-level voting results. Trump crossed the barrier despite efforts by Texas senator Ted Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich to prevent him from clinching the nomination by staying in the race for weeks after it became impossible for they themselves to climb to 1,237 delegates. The success of the Cruz campaign in particular at advancing slates of delegates sympathetic to him, who might swing their support behind him in a conjectural second round of voting at the national convention, drove Trump to condemn the nominating system as \u201crigged\u201d. But voters in 31 states awarded Trump outright victory, and he steadily amassed an unanswerable lead. A dominating performance in Indiana on 3 May, in which Trump claimed all 57 of the state\u2019s delegates in a contest that Cruz had hoped to win, caused both Cruz and Kasich to suspend their candidacies. Trump is expected to be nominated for president with one round of voting in Cleveland in July. Some delegates, however, remained wishful for a second round of voting, in which they could buck off the preferences of their states\u2019 voters and vote for someone else. Cameron Linton of Pittsburgh told the Associated Press that he would back Trump on the first ballot, since Trump won the primary vote in Linton\u2019s congressional district. \u201cIf there\u2019s a second ballot I won\u2019t vote for Donald Trump,\u201d Linton said. \u201cHe\u2019s ridiculous. There\u2019s no other way to say it.\u201d   Related: US election delegate tracker: who's winning the presidential nomination?     Trump, a political neophyte who for years delivered caustic commentary on the state of the nation from the sidelines but had never run for office, fought off 16 other Republican contenders in an often ugly primary race. Many on the right have been slow to warm to Trump, wary of his conservative bona fides. Others worry about Trump\u2019s crass personality and the lewd comments he\u2019s made about women. But millions of grassroots activists, many who have been outsiders to the political process, have embraced Trump as a plain-speaking populist who is not afraid to offend. Steve House, chairman of the Colorado Republican party and an unbound delegate who confirmed his support of Trump to AP, said he likes the billionaire\u2019s background as a businessman.           Donald Trump tells Jimmy Kimmel: I have used aliases    \u201cLeadership is leadership,\u201d House said. \u201cIf he can surround himself with the political talent, I think he will be fine.\u201d Others who confirmed their decision to back Trump were more tepid, saying they are supporting him out of a sense of obligation because he won their state\u2019s primary. Trump\u2019s path to the Republican presidential nomination began with an escalator ride. Trump and his wife, Melania, descended an escalator into the basement lobby of the Trump Tower on 16 June 2015, for an announcement many observers said would never come: the celebrity real estate developer, who had flirted with running for office in the past, would announce that he was launching his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. That speech set the tone for the candidate\u2019s ability to dominate the headlines with provocative statements, insults and hyperbole. He called Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d, promised to build a wall between the US and Mexico and ban Muslims from the US for an indeterminate time. He put down women based on their looks. And he unleashed an uncanny marketing ability in which he deduced his critics\u2019 weak points and distilled those to nicknames that stuck. \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, \u201cWeak\u201d Jeb Bush and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz, among others, all were forced into primarily reacting to Trump. They fell one by one \u2013 leaving Trump sole survivor of a riotous Republican primary. His rallies became must-see events and magnets for free publicity. Onstage, he dispensed populism that drew thousands of supporters, many wearing his trademark \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and chanting, \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d The events drew protests too \u2013 with demonstrators sometimes being forcibly ejected from the proceedings. One rally in Chicago was cancelled after thousands of demonstrators surrounded the venue and the secret service could no longer vouch for the candidate\u2019s safety. When voting started, Trump was not so fast out of the gate. He lost the Iowa caucuses in February, falling behind Cruz and barely edging Rubio for second. He recovered in New Hampshire. From there he and Cruz fiercely engaged, with Trump winning some and losing some but one way or another dominating the rest of the primary season \u2013 in votes or at least in attention \u2013 and ultimately in delegates. All the while, Republican leaders declared themselves appalled by Trump\u2019s rise. Conservatives called the one-time Democrat a fraud. But they failed, ultimately, to block him. Republican leaders slowly, warily, began meeting with Trump and his staff. And he began winning endorsements from a few members of Congress. As with other aspects of his campaign, Trump upended the traditional role of money in the race. He incurred relatively low campaign costs \u2013 just $57m through the end of April. He covered most of it with at least $43m of his own money loaned to the campaign. He spent less than $21m on paid television and radio commercials. That\u2019s about one-quarter of what Jeb Bush and his allies spent on TV. Bush dropped out of the race three months ago, after disappointing results in South Carolina. Trump, 69, the son of a New York City real estate magnate, had risen to fame in the 1980s and 1990s, overseeing major real estate deals, watching his financial fortunes rise, then fall, hosting The Apprentice TV show and authoring more than a dozen books.
