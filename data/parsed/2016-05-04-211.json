  "body": "A$AP Mob should really replace their dollar sign with a question mark. With the initial success of A$AP Rocky and A$AP Ferg, the then 13-strong New York hip-hop collective looked primed to become a sophisticated, genre-splicing and less wilfully offensive alternative to Odd Future. Then their debut album L.O.R.D. was scrapped in 2014 and A$AP Nast, aka Tariq Devega, seemed robbed of his shot. As Rocky\u2019s cousin and lead rapper on L.O.R.D.\u2019s psych-funk first single Trillmatic, the album was to be Nast\u2019s breakout showcase. Three years later, he\u2019s touring clubs with barely a pinch of recognisable verses to his name. \u201cThey said I couldn\u2019t do this,\u201d he barks at the XOYO crowd, \u201cwatch me.\u201d Granted, to fill an hour on stage he needs assistance. He pays tribute to A$AP Rocky by bouncing silently along to Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2, gets a reluctant girl onstage from the audience to selfie\u2011dance to Yamborghini High and pads the set with more gunshots than a Grand Theft Auto boss fight. The highlight is a surprise appearance from Skepta and a champagne-swigging riot from the Boy Better Know crew of Ladies Hit Squad, Man (Gang) and Shutdown, a unifying bear-hug between New York rap and grime.     A$AP Nast works the crowd at XOYO, London Photograph: Jake Davis    Yet Nast\u2019s spitfire raps, political edge (the lyrics in Lords Never Worry declares A$AP Mob \u201cthe new Black Panthers\u201d) and creative production \u2013 siphoning Rocky\u2019s narcotic sprawl into his ultraviolent beats and mariachi siesta grooves while kneeling regularly at the shrine of Biggie Smalls \u2013 suggest he\u2019ll strive and prosper. Come Hella Hoes, an Exorcist theme for pimps, XOYO is so pumped Nast even stays on stage to crowdsurf to the subsequent DJ set.",
