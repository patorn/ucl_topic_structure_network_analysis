Send us your tips via GuardianWitness including as much detail as you can in around 100 words (along with website, menu details and prices etc, if possible). The best tips will appear in print in next weekend\u2019s Travel section and the winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a \u00a3200 hotel voucher from Hotels.com, allowing you to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide. Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using the text tab. You\u2019re welcome to add a photo if you own the copyright to it \u2013 but it\u2019s the text we\u2019ll be judging.
