One and a half years on, with a decent level of German under his belt, the French literature student found himself glued to the website of the state broadcaster ORF on Monday, following the most gripping political drama the country has experienced for decades. \u201cVan der Bellen, he\u2019s for Europe, that I know,\u201d Mohamad said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want Austria to close its borders.\u201d And the clearest message he got from Hofer, he said, was that \u201che doesn\u2019t like Muslims. He thinks we\u2019re all terrorists. It\u2019s common knowledge that Hofer carries a gun, and that he has said he has to do it because Austria is a more dangerous place since the refugees came.\u201d  The 20-year-old was cautious to hide his alarm at the rise of the anti-immigrant Freedom party (FP\u00d6) in recent days. He was, after all, a guest in this country, he said. What he was keen to stress instead was that \u201cthere really are lots of good Austrians out there\u201d. He cited the journalist who had put him up in his flat in Vienna\u2019s 5th district, where Mohamad talked to the Guardian. \u201cHe has shown so much warmth towards me and he\u2019s not alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to Austria.\u201d   Related: Who are the two men who competed to be Austria's next president?    Hundreds of thousands of refugees travelled through Austria last year, about 100,000 of whom applied for asylum. It was the issue on which the FP\u00d6 was able to capitalise, bolstering still further its already strong anti-immigrant credentials. While waiting for the crucial postal votes to be counted, Mohamad admitted his concerns in the event of a Hofer win. \u201cThe thing I fear most is that he\u2019ll say the refugees have to go back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back, of course, but because he\u2019s already labelled us all as Isis fighters, I worry the pressure on him by his supporters, because of the expectations he\u2019s instilled in them. It would be a lot for him to resist doing this.\u201d     Migrants line-up to board trains at the railway station in Nickelsdorf, Austria September 5, 2015. Photograph: Srdjan Zivulovic/Reuters    Nasim, a driver from Iran, who arrived in Austria from Tehran 41 years ago at the age of 19, said he had voted for Van der Bellen \u201cnot because he was really my man but because I was determined to keep the other one out\u201d. He said it was not the FP\u00d6\u2019s anti-immigrant streak that he was most concerned about, but the economic consequences. \u201cI remember the Waldheim era only too well,\u201d he said, recalling Austria\u2019s most contentious presidential race before this one, in 1986, when the country elected Kurt Waldheim, a former United Nations secretary general, who, it had been revealed, had served in the Wehrmacht close to the scenes of Nazi crimes.  \u201cThe sanctions imposed on us then had such a negative impact on our economy. And it\u2019s us little people who take the brunt of that,\u201d Nasim said. In a statement welcoming Van der Bellen\u2019s victory on Monday, the president of the Conference of European Rabbis, Rabbi Goldschmidt, said: \u201cThis is a clear sign that Europe is beginning to realise that hate and fear politics are not the answer to the many challenges we are facing on the continent.\u201d  Florian Klenk, a leading Austrian commentator and editor of the weekly news magazine Falter, said his country had been polarised by an election dominated by the topic of immigration \u201cand everything to do with it\u201d.  \u201cBut it\u2019s striking that in the often rural areas with the least refugees, the fear towards them is greatest, and they tended to vote for the anti-immigrant candidate, and those with the most voted for the man in favour of keeping Austria\u2019s borders open,\u201d he said. \u201cA case in point is the village I come from in [the state of] Lower Austria which took in a lot of refugees and voted for Van der Bellen, while the village next door, which has hardly seen any, voted for Hofer.\u201d In a working class district in the north of Vienna that has seen a considerable swing towards the FP\u00d6 in recent months, despite having been a Social Democrat (SP\u00d6) stronghold for decades, people were enjoying the warm spring sunshine, some sunbathing at the so-called workers\u2019 beach (an old SP\u00d6 creation) at the Alte Donau, a branch of the river Danube.

Mostafa, a taxi driver who arrived from Egypt 16 years ago, and who was dropping guests off at an FP\u00d6 party at the Prater on Sunday evening, said every leap the FP\u00d6 made in the polls made life increasingly difficult for many of Austria\u2019s foreigners, particularly those from Arab countries like himself.  \u201cThere are foreigners who have been here twice as long as Hofer has been alive who were invited to build up the country again after the war,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he and his party have made the atmosphere towards them so poisonous when they should have been grateful to them.\u201d",
