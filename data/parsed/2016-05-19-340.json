  "body": "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump resurrected accusations of rape against former president Bill Clinton during an hour-long TV interview on Wednesday night. Trump\u2019s remarks came in response to a question from Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity, who asked Trump about his feelings on a recent New York Times article that dug into the candidate\u2019s troubled history with women, which Trump called a \u201ccon job\u201d that made him \u201cfurious\u201d. \u201cAre they going to interview Juanita Broaddrick?\u201d Hannity asked Trump, in apparent defense of the candidate. \u201cAre they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey? In one case, it\u2019s about exposure. In another case, it\u2019s about groping and fondling and touching against a woman\u2019s will.\u201d \u201cAnd rape,\u201d Trump responded.  \u201cAnd rape,\u201d Hannity followed up. \u201cAnd big settlements, massive settlements ... and lots of other things,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cAnd impeachment for lying, and losing your law license. You know, he lost his law license, OK? He couldn\u2019t practice law. And you don\u2019t read about this on Clinton.\u201d The attack on Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband has no precedent in modern US politics, although Trump has hinted for months that he would be willing to make his attacks against Clinton personal, up to and including her marriage to the former president. Before a single vote had been cast in either primary, Trump labelled the former president \u201cone of the great women abusers of all time\u201d, calling Hillary Clinton a hypocrite for accusing him of sexism. In that same month, Trump published a video on Instagram that implicitly compared the former president to disgraced comedian Bill Cosby, paired with audio of a famous Hillary Clinton quotation: \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are human rights, and human rights are women\u2019s rights, once and for all. Let\u2019s keep fighting for dignity.\u201d       Trump reiterated those comments earlier this month, telling supporters in Washington state that \u201cshe\u2019s married to a man who was the worst abuser of women in the history of politics. She\u2019s married to a man who hurt many women.\u201d \u201cNobody, perhaps in the history of politics, was worse to women or abused women more than Bill Clinton,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cAnd she\u2019s taking negative ads on me.\u201d Trump\u2019s initial criticisms came at the same time as a tweet from Broaddrick, a former nursing home administrator who alleged in 1999 that Clinton raped her in an Arkansas hotel room during his first gubernatorial campaign in 1978, brought old allegations of sexual misconduct to the fore.    I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me.  I am now 73....it never goes away.\u2014 Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) January 6, 2016    When Broaddrick was subpoenaed to testify in a sexual harassment suit by Jones against the then-president in 1997, she submitted a sworn affidavit denying \u201cunfounded rumors and stories circulated that Mr Clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late 70s\u201d. Clinton has denied Broaddrick\u2019s claims since the late 1990s, when they first surfaced.  Clinton settled out of court with Jones for $850,000, and denied Willey\u2019s accusations that he sexually assaulted her during his first term in the White House. The charges from Trump are likely the most aggressive attack on a candidate\u2019s spouse in political history, although he made singling out the wives of fellow Republican candidates a near-regular feature of his primary campaign. In one sustained dust-up with fellow Republican candidate Ted Cruz, Trump negatively compared Heidi Cruz\u2019s appearance to that of his own wife, a former model.",
