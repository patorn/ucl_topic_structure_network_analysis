  "body": "This very affecting feature debut from director Joe Stephenson, adapted from Freddie Machin\u2019s play by Chris New, centres on a teenager with learning difficulties (Scott Chambers, superb) who communicates more easily with animals \u2013 both dead and alive \u2013 than with people. Living in a caravan with his volatile and violent brother Polly (a convincingly wired Morgan Watkins), 15-year-old Richard befriends Yasmin Paige\u2019s Annabel, whose family owns the land they live on. With its clash of natural beauty and societal disorder, Chicken nods towards the template of Ken Loach\u2019s Kes, with Richard doting on pet hen Fiona, a symbol of his own flightless yet nurturing plight. Like the young Leonardo DiCaprio in What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape, Chambers\u2019s performance has tuning-fork precision, his slightly skewed physical movements and scattershot speech creating a childlike portrait that is neither patronising nor pat, ensuring that Richard becomes a fully rounded character with a complex emotional life, engaging and empathetic. A late-in-the-day revelation provides an unnecessary bombshell, which somewhat underestimates the power of the preceding drama, but Eben Bolter\u2019s widescreen cinematography captures the warmth, loneliness and harsh reality of this disenfranchised world with unobtrusive aplomb.         Watch the trailer for Chicken.",
