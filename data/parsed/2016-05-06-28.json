  "body": "Somewhere buried deep in a Berlin bunker is Adolf Hitler\u2019s last will and testament entitled \u201cKen Livingstone: My Part in his Downfall\u201d. The brief was straightforward enough. Keep the former London mayor locked up for the day; easier said than done, admittedly, given that Ken has yet to find a camera he didn\u2019t want to appear in front of. Failing that, the Labour high command ought to have given him a minder to make sure he stuck to the prepared script of \u201cLabour has done incredibly well to hang on and Jeremy Corbyn is on course to win the next election\u201d that ever other Labour figure had used in their media appearances. It may not have looked that way, but Ken tried. He really did. But Ken has developed a late-onset variant of Tourette\u2019s that means he keeps saying the word \u201cHitler\u201d in public. So when Sky News turned up in his garden while he was repotting his newts, he just couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cWhat do the election results mean for Labour?\u201d asked presenter Dermot Murnaghan. \u201cAdolf Hitler,\u201d said Ken. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d \u201cAdolf Hitler. It\u2019s all in that interview with Joseph Finkelstein.\u201d           Ken Livingstone defends Hitler comments \u2013 video    Murnaghan scratched his head. He could think of a Norman Finkelstein and a Daniel Finkelstein, but not a Joseph Finkelstein. Unless he was talking about the gynaecologist on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue. \u201cThere was a connection between some Jews and Adolf Hitler,\u201d said Ken firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of fact. It only takes you half an hour on the internet to find it.\u201d \u201cBut what do the election results mean for Labour?\u201d Murnaghan tried again. \u201cAdolf Hitler got to some embittered old Blairites.\u201d Realising they were heading for yet another anti-semitism PR disaster, Labour sent out a couple of special agents tasked with sedating Ken by any means possible. Too late. Ken had got the bug and was on a roll. Just as the week before when one Hitler had led to another and he had toured every media outlet saying the word \u201cHitler\u201d as frequently as possible, so Ken had once again got the taste. And the BBC were only too happy to indulge him. \u201cWhat do the election results mean for Labour?\u201d asked presenter Jo Coburn, delighted to have some guaranteed on-air entertainment to liven up a long afternoon. \u201cAdolf Hitler,\u201d said Ken. Coburn tried to engage him on his own terms. \u201cDo you think your remarks about Hitler might have damaged Sadiq Khan\u2019s chances in London.\u201d Ken opened his mouth. What he meant to say was: \u201cI truly regret what I said and I want to draw a line under what happened last week.\u201d But what came out was \u201cSadiq was only a lad when Lenni Brenner published his book on the relationship between Zionism and Nazism. The thing about Adolf Hitler was ...\u201d With that Ken was off on yet another extended history lesson about how Hitler had originally only wanted to find somewhere nice for the Jews to live and it was just one of those things that it had all ended so acrimoniously with 6 million dead. Ken sighed. It wasn\u2019t easy being so misunderstood. Why, if it was crystal clear to him that the anti-Corbyn elements in both the media and the Labour party were part of a global Zionist plot, wasn\u2019t it blindingly obvious to anyone else? Then it hit him. He had also been got at by a global Zionist plot that was further damaging the Labour party by making him say the word \u2018Hitler\u2019.  Somewhere deep in a Berlin bunker, Hitler shook his head. \u201cOh Ken,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d",
