  "body": "Your editorial (This ruthless ousting shows where football\u2019s priorities lie, 24 May) sums up a growing view among supporters: namely that match-going fans are being exploited unnecessarily. With the vast amounts of television money going to every Premier League club, most have spurned the opportunity to reward fans, and indeed grass-roots football, by cutting significantly ticket prices, and by subsidising football in local areas, perhaps by funding all referees\u2019 match fees in local leagues. I am a lifelong Southampton fan, but I am not renewing my season ticket, because I resent seeing the bulk of the television money going into the pockets of players and agents. The clubs do not need the income from tickets to survive, as they once did. This problem is, of course, not unique to Southampton, and I remain a fan, but I wonder how exciting televised football will be when the stadiums are half empty, because traditional supporters have been priced out. The corporate \u201cfans\u201d will not fancy the seats at ground level, behind the goals.Les VivianSouthampton \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
