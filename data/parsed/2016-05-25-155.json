If the identikit black-tie uniform of red-carpet menswear has for years been looking as if it has been styled by a particularly unimaginative spambot, 2016 has proved the exception to the rule \u2013 with the suit jacket among the casualties. The most forward thinking looks have come from those eschewing typical black suit jackets in favour of sartorial spin. Here are some of the alternative looks that work \u2026 The broken suit jacket: Ryan Gosling     Ryan Gosling tops off with a white suit jacket at Cannes.

On the Cannes Croisette, Ryan Gosling displayed the most classic form of broken suit-ism: the white tux jacket. The clenched fist against sartorial norms is optional.  The conceptual suit jacket: Shawn Mendes      Shawn Mendes in his conceptual suit jacket.

The precisely cut black undershirt completely changed the architecture of the outfit and shows what can be achieved when you pimp your suit jacket look.  The longer suit jacket: Zayn Malik     Zayn Malik on The Voice goes for a quilted leather jacket. Photograph: NBC/Getty Images    Referencing the peacock revolution, there has been a trend for heavily embroidered suit jackets on the red carpet. But could the next dandy-influenced look be the longer suit jacket? Think of Peter Kosminsky\u2019s Nehru jacket at the Baftas, Seal on the Billboard red carpet going full-on winter coat and Zayn Malik on the US Voice, debuting his black leather quilted jacket, which was a little bit The Matrix and a little bit oligarch\u2019s day out.

Basically, because you\u2019ve made a strong enough sartorial statement without having to dilute things with the addition of shoulder pads.  The leather jacket: Nick Jonas      Nick Jonas\u2019s luxe leather jacket.

True, the leather jacket at celebrity events can sometimes go wrong and look a bit six-star resort in Dubai, but when it\u2019s done right \u2013 viz Nick Jonas at the Billboard awards \u2013 it can look like the best sort of suit jacket alternative: edgy and elegant.",
