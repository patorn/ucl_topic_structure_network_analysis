  "body": "Few films at the Cannes film festival have been as highly-anticipated as American Honey, British director Andrea Arnold\u2019s first movie made outside the UK. But speaking to press on Sunday, in the wake of largely rave reviews and ahead of the film\u2019s official red carpet gala, Arnold revealed that the experience of driving round the country researching the movie was almost as transformative as making it.    Related: American Honey review: Andrea Arnold mislays map on sweet, indelible roadtrip    \u201cI had some quite difficult times travelling by myself, being in that open wilderness,\u201d said Arnold, who won the jury prize at Cannes for Red Road in 2006 and three years later for Fish Tank. \u201cBeing on my own in those big open spaces was quite interesting but it was quite solitary at times.\u201d Arnold recalled tornado lessons offered to her by one woman in an especially remote and stormy part of Alabama.  The film follows a ragtag crew of young magazine salespeople going from doorstep to doorstep trying to persuade people to subscribe to various publications. It shows a country which, says Arnold \u201cis a mix of the America I grew up with \u2013 which I mostly saw though Hollywood; my romanticised idea of it \u2013 and the contemporary America I saw when I did my trips. \u201cI was quite upset about some to the towns I went to, and some of the poverty I saw. It seemed really different to me than in the UK. When people don\u2019t have money they can\u2019t have health care and they can\u2019t do things like go to the dentist. Those kind of things really shocked me.\u201d Arnold said she had arrived at one very small town in West Virginia with a cut-price store, a funeral directors (\u201cwhich was thriving\u201d) and three pharmacies, all busy. \u201cI asked them what they were dishing out and they said painkillers to older people and antidepressants to younger people. There was a lot of addiction.\u201d      Riley Keough, Sasha Lane, Andrea Arnold and Shia LaBeouf at the film\u2019s photocall. Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images    Shia LaBeouf, the highest-profile member of Arnold\u2019s cast, said it was an America with which he was familiar. \u201cIn Bakersville, where my father lived for a time, the only thing there is a prison. So everyone works in the prison. I\u2019m part of that underclass. That\u2019s where I come from, so I know about it.\u201d Echoed Arnold: \u201cIn small towns there\u2019s not a lot of industries if you\u2019re coming out of school and need to work. A lot of the opportunities were working in fast food restaurants. That seemed quite sad to me.\u201d The film\u2019s leading character is Star, an 18-year-old who joins the crew to get away from her dead-beat existence in Texas, and fuelled by an attraction to LaBeouf\u2019s character, Jake. But the pressure to sell subscriptions \u2013 or simply persuade people out of cash with a sob-story \u2013 is considerable. It is applied by the group\u2019s formidable ring-leader (Riley Keough, Elvis Presley\u2019s granddaughter), who cracks with whip wearing heavy fake tan and a stars-and-stripes bikini.  The gang, said Arnold, is \u201ca small potted version of the American dream. They\u2019re working hard at selling themselves, which is what capitalism is all about.\u201d She also compared the transaction to that attempted in the UK by charity workers or Big Issue sellers. \u201cYou\u2019re not really buying the magazine, you\u2019re buying the person.\u201d Arnold discovered most of her cast scouting around America; it includes a construction worker, a skateboarder and a former exotic dancer. She found her star, student Sasha Lane, now 20, when she was sunbathing on the beach for spring break, just a month before shooting began.      Sasha Lane at the premiere.

But she seemed so sweet.\u201d A followup meeting in a Waffle House and a brief audition in a hotel lobby sealed the deal. \u201cWalking down the pier,\u201d remembered Lane, \u201cI felt so whole; I was so happy to have met her. I knew she was someone important and going to look out for me and that this wasn\u2019t going to be a porn scam.\u201d",
