  "body": "\u2018She put her neck on the line to make sure she got the performances from the actors\u2019 Samantha Morton Actor and director First and foremost, Antonia broke the invisible ceiling. Being a young, working-class actor, watching films such as Safe \u2013 I\u2019d never seen anything like that before. Back then, I just thought the actors did their acting and that directors did the camera stuff. I was watching those performances by Kate Hardie and Robert Carlyle and thought: \u201cWow, how are they doing this? Who is getting this out of them?\u201d It was only later that I learned about Antonia\u2019s working methods, her bullshit detector and her dedication to the actors. The world she created for actors was absolutely sacrosanct. She was just phenomenal. She had a commitment to truth and fought to make films \u2013 not simply by being a woman, but by the way she saw the bollocks that surrounds the film industry. She had an incredible ability to filter: what is essential here? What is right? Why are we doing this? She was a true inspiration, and now I have become a film-maker myself I almost try to live by her rules. She had an unwritten manifesto that seeped in to the consciousness of my generation, and inspired you to become the actor you wanted to be.     \u2018She had a voice and has left a legacy\u2019: Samantha Morton on Antonia Bird. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock    I knew Antonia well, but I never got to work with her. It nearly happened; we met several times on The Meat Trade [Irvine Welsh\u2019s script about 19th-century murderers Burke and Hare], and it broke my heart that it never went ahead. She was a hero of mine. She put her neck on the line to make sure she got the performances from the actors, that they were protected and the shoot was protected. Her empathy and commitment to her cast and crew was absolutely extraordinary. Also, you have to remember, it is an old boys\u2019 club \u2013 I promise you. We are not nurturing enough female writers, female directors, and this is where Antonia was unprecedented in what she achieved in this country. It\u2019s a shame: while she was alive, there wasn\u2019t the appreciation there should have been. But she had a voice and has left a legacy \u2013 people like Lynne Ramsay, Clio Barnard and Andrea Arnold wouldn\u2019t be here in the same way without her. \u2018Her genius animated and illuminated all her work\u2019 Richard Eyre Director I met Antonia at the Royal Court theatre in 1980. She was a resident director there, appointed by Max Stafford-Clark, who attached her to my production of Hamlet (with Jonathan Pryce) as my assistant. She was a wonderful colleague \u2013 constantly questioning, but constantly supportive. I saw for the first time what singled her out later as a remarkable director: she was entirely engaged with the actors and they saw in her an ally, a mentor and a friend. Two years later, I asked Antonia to join me at the National Theatre to be my assistant on my production of Guys and Dolls. We all enjoyed ourselves (\u201cThis beats working,\u201d said Bob Hoskins on more than one occasion), no one more so than Antonia, who would rock with joy \u2013 thumb in mouth \u2013 as we started to see scenes come together. When we transferred the production to the Prince of Wales theatre in the West End three years later, I wasn\u2019t available to direct it, so I asked Antonia to take it over, which she did with characteristic brio. I didn\u2019t see a lot of Antonia after that. She started to work in TV and I followed her career with fascination, joy and a kind of vicarious pride. She had a real eye for film-making and, as importantly, a rare gift of empathy for actors and the people they portrayed in her films. As far as I know, Antonia wasn\u2019t religious, but, as few people do (or can), she followed the injunction to \u201clove thy neighbour\u201d \u2013 caring for strangers, not because they were poor or unlucky, but just because they were human. That takes a sort of genius, and that genius animated and illuminated all her work. \u2018The amount she managed to achieve as a female director is something of a miracle\u2019 Kate Hardie Actor and director When you call someone a political film-maker, it is possible to think you are referring only to the subjects they put on screen. Antonia was a political film-maker; she was also, regardless of her politics, quite simply a highly skilled and creative director. But she knew film was a deeply effective communication tool, and without doubt she used it to voice her political beliefs and frustrations.     \u2018While working with Antonia I felt empowered, included and respected\u2019 \u2013 Kate Hardie. Photograph: BFI    Being a political film-maker also affects how a director behaves off screen. How they treat their cast, their crew. How they view the people with power and money. Antonia was a deeply socialist film-maker both on and \u2013 importantly \u2013 off camera. She had a constant eye out for the abuse of power, and huge respect for the \u201cworkers\u201d that helped her tell stories the way she wanted to tell them. She saw actors as technicians, as co-workers who deserved her protection and care. To be on an Antonia set was to know she had your back totally and, often to her own detriment, was not pandering to producers or those with the money; her focus was on supporting you. She was deeply collaborative, and while working with Antonia I felt empowered, included and respected. I had the space and right to comment on anything I didn\u2019t believe about the work \u2013 rather than her seeing my opinions as an actor overstepping the mark, she treated my instincts about character and dialogue (and even the odd shot) as a valuable part of my skills and therefore deserving of her attention. I often joke that working with Antonia as early as I did in my career ruined it for me \u2013 it\u2019s a silly joke, but it has its roots in fact. I first worked with her in 1984, and I\u2019ve rarely had such an experience since. The world of film and TV is a pretty conservative place. Although often perceived as highly liberal, in reality it is rife with hierarchy, emotional repression and abuses of power. Antonia put herself on the line again and again. She taught me a huge amount about acting and working with the camera. But she also taught me a huge amount about the morality of collaboration. These are not necessarily lessons that make for an easy career. Her convictions and concerns were pretty non-negotiable, her political beliefs were her map, and at times that made things difficult for her. But, in an industry full of dubious morals and flaky convictions, I found her truly inspiring. And \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t really need pointing out these days, but sadly it still does \u2013 in an industry whose statistics regarding gender equality are worse than both banking and the army, the amount she managed to achieve as a female director is something of a miracle. \u2018Through her, I made it into the kind of TV that inspired me when I was growing up\u2019 Aidan Gillen Actor I\u2019ve never been too hot at auditioning, and even to date my record of scoring roles that way is erratic. But when I met Antonia, in 1993, what she did was get a group of people in and simply try some things out. Now that I think of it, everyone who was there that first day actually ended up in her film. I tend not to say stuff just for the sake of it in improvs, but at one point I just exploded in a fit of rage, which took even me by surprise. I ended up in Safe, playing Gypo, a vulnerable homeless kid prone to fits of rage and, even though I\u2019d had a lead role a couple of years before, this felt like a real breakout for me. Through the group that she brought together, Antonia really dared the cast to push each other hard, and that\u2019s what it ran on. Her idea to bring Billy Bragg in to write songs for it was genius and helped place the drama politically.     \u2018Safe felt like a real breakout for me ... Antonia really dared the cast to push each other hard\u2019 \u2013 Aidan Gillen. Photograph: BFI    On set, there was such a highly charged atmosphere that I just didn\u2019t want to go home at night. When it shifted to a week of night shoots at the end, I was satisfied, because I didn\u2019t have to. I learned so much from Kate Hardie, who was the real lead of the piece, and who had worked with Antonia before. We were together in nearly all our scenes and the lesson was: \u201cDo what feels right for you and don\u2019t be scared to do anything.\u201d Soon I was stripping off my clothes in crowded rooms and punching doors and letting rip in a way that left you exposed and vulnerable. That was all needed and used, too, and ultimately engineered by Antonia. I saw Safe for the first time in ages last year, and, while my performance is scrappy, what does come across strongly is how much of people\u2019s hearts went into it. Afterwards I didn\u2019t see Antonia that much, maybe three or four times. I met up with her in Los Angeles later the next year when she was working on the film Mad Love. I could tell she was making the effort, but that Hollywood wasn\u2019t really somewhere she was ever going to be happy. But I was really glad that, through her, I had made it into the kind of TV that inspired me when I was growing up. I can connect the dots from Safe to every role I\u2019ve had since. \u2018Antonia could have stepped out of one of her movies\u2019 Mark Cousins Writer and director Antonia Bird and I were writing a script, Scotstoun, about a woman in a small Scottish town, so we spent a weekend in Killin on Loch Tay. I drove up, we unpacked and then we worked. And worked. Before dinner, during it, afterwards. It was the fifth project we tried to get made, and each time I was struck by her energy, her endless work. With a screenplay and character biogs in front of her, she could go on all night. Script arcs, story beats and plot development: these were her meat and potatoes.     The Hamburg Cell, directed by Bird. \u2018Antonia couldn\u2019t stand on the sidelines. She wanted to bring out the innate convulsiveness in everyday lives\u2019 \u2013 Mark Cousins. Photograph: Channel 4    At a time when fashionable tastes in film were shifting towards minimalism, she was a maximalist. She admired the great Iranian film-makers who fixed their cameras and let shots run long. But Antonia couldn\u2019t stand on the sidelines. She wanted to bring out the innate convulsiveness in everyday lives. Her rage at the system and her empathy with its victims made her work like a pressure cooker: the temperature building, an explosion imminent. That\u2019s why she admired Scorsese films and the writing of Jimmy McGovern. Her film style was like Sam Fuller\u2019s or Nicholas Ray\u2019s. She should have remade Ray\u2019s Johnny Guitar. Sometimes, film-makers are unlike their movies. Ken Loach is gently spoken, whereas his films are enraged. Stanley Donen is angry, while his films, such as Singin\u2019 in the Rain, mostly aren\u2019t. Although she hated being on screen, Antonia could have stepped out of one of her movies. When she came to your house, it got livelier. She was always taking off or putting on scarves, putting herself down, apologising for being late or early or interrupting, starting a new sentence before she\u2019d finished the last. Confidence migrates. If it\u2019s not in yourself, it can appear in your work. I was to be a producer for Antonia, an enabler, an articulator of why she matters. I showed her an old Judy Holliday and Jack Lemmon film, It Should Happen to You, and we tried to remake it, perhaps with Drew Barrymore. I failed to raise money for her. That\u2019s my fault, and the industry\u2019s, too. Energy can\u2019t be destroyed, of course, so Antonia kept on working. What film would she have made about the refugee camps? What would she have said about the Hillsborough verdict of unlawful killing? That\u2019s the problem when a clear thinker dies: you miss their clarity. You miss their story beats. \u2018She let the scenes run ... she let the silences and the moments play\u2019 Maxine Peake Actor I first worked with Antonia on a BBC series called Faith, about the miners\u2019 strike, which she produced, but Safe was the first film of hers I saw. It stayed with me: I had no idea what it was, it was something I\u2019d stumbled across, but I knew it was a remarkable piece of storytelling with great perfomances \u2013 I remembered Kate Hardie in particular. Antonia\u2019s films pushed me towards what I wanted to do. They were the kind of dramas I wanted to be part of: groundbreaking, but with a social conscience.

Photograph: Brian Sweeney/BBC/Company Pictures/All3Media    Later on, I had signed up to The Village, and when I heard Antonia was going to direct it I knew we were in safe hands, politically and artistically. There was supposed to be a two-week rehearsal period, but, as often happens in TV, problems with everyone\u2019s availability meant it got a bit disorganised. So, I had the pleasure of sitting in a cafe in Hayfield in the Peak District for two weeks and just sort of chatting with Antonia. I feel really blessed, in a way: even if we didn\u2019t get the rehearsal we planned, it was worth it. A lot of directors these days are all about putting their mark on the film, but Antonia was very much focused on the performances and getting the most out of actors. She let the scenes run and we felt like we were doing film; that was the beauty of it. We didn\u2019t feel like The Village was the normal telly, where it had to be rushed; she let the silences and the moments play. I think the first episode ended up being twice the length it was supposed to be. It was shortly after the first series that I heard something was wrong. Kate emailed to say: \u201cAntonia\u2019s not well.\u201d It was such a shock. All I remembered was her saying she was tired \u2013 but she\u2019d just directed four huge TV episodes, so you think, no wonder you\u2019re tired. An Antonia Bird retrospective runs 12-26 May at BFI Southbank in London. The documentary Antonia Bird: From EastEnders to Hollywood screens on BBC4 on 22 May",
