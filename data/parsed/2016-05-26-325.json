  "body": "Fitfully thrilling and consistently baffling, Paramour \u2013 Cirque du Soleil\u2019s first attempt at a Broadway book musical \u2013 is the story of a young singer torn between the megalomaniacal director, who wants to make her his star, and the tender songwriter, who wants to make her his muse. Or perhaps it\u2019s a parable of forbidden love as enacted by shirtless twins in an erotic aerial pas de deux. Or maybe it\u2019s a wacky caper comedy with a culminating chase scene performed atop a giant trampoline. Honestly, it\u2019s hard to tell.

Having fallen out with his leading lady, he arrives at a speakeasy where he\u2019s captivated by the lissome charms of Indigo (Ruby Lewis), a ginger ingenue just off the bus from Indiana. (It\u2019s remarkable he notices her at all, considering the jugglers, contortionists, acrobats and tap dancers who also populate this bar.) Despite the distractions, he casts Indigo in his latest flick, also called Paramour, an allegory of fame assembled from a pastiche of famous films. He also hires her pining piano man, Joey (Ryan Vona), to compose the movie\u2019s love theme.      Paramour. Photograph: Joan Marcus     Under Philippe Decoufl\u00e9\u2019s conception and direction, the mechanics of plot are achieved via a creaky literalism, in which the songs (by Bob & Bill, Guy Dubuc, and Marc Lessard with lyrics by Andreas Carlsson) continually reiterate the snatches of dialogue (for which no one is credited, which explains a lot). When AJ gestures toward Joey and says: \u201cThe guy over at the piano, well, he started playing a song,\u201d Joey opens with the quatrain: \u201cFrom my seat here at the piano / In this underground cafe / I accompany a singer / Who can melt your heart away.\u201d When Indigo introduces herself, she sings: \u201cPlease allow me, friends, to introduce myself.\u201d When the characters croon about dangling in a love triangle, a couple of trapeze artists sway above. It\u2019s remarkable that no one whips out a protractor.   Related: How Cirque du Soleil's hippy circus took over the world     Yet the production is often more fanciful in incorporating cirque aspects. How did the various creative directors justify those hunky twins soaring from straps during a scene set in Cleopatra\u2019s Egypt? Why are other men cavorting on a teeterboard during the Calamity Jane number? Why are there zombies? And why do those zombies look as if their goblin-esque costumes were looted from the Lyric Theatre\u2019s last inhabitant, Spider-Man? (Actually, if Paramour is an elaborate stunt to make Spider-Man appear modest and sensible by comparison, well played.)  And yet, a work this extravagantly misguided generates its own excitement. The mind can\u2019t rest as it struggles to make sense of a woman warbling the title song as a man balances an umbrella on his head, of a dance number superseded by a diabolo routine, of lampshades fluttering about like so many tasseled UFOs during a love ballad. If Paramour has all the elements of a traditional Broadway tuner \u2013 songs, dances, conversation, characters \u2013 they are jumbled together in so topsy-turvy a fashion as to achieve a perverse originality, a three-ring circus of artistic muddle, miscalculation and mayhem. And zombies.",
