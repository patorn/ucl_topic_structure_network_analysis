In a part of London that has been gentrifying for half a century, it looks out of place. Many of the tall Georgian terraces on the street have been expensively restored and extended. Most of the cars are BMWs. Bankers eat duck in the pub down the road. The first time Thornberry stood for the seat, in 2005, Labour was in the early stages of an electoral decline that has continued in most parts of Britain ever since. She won by a flimsy 484 votes. As the 2010 election approached, it was widely assumed that she was doomed. \u201cA lot of my activists went to bookies up and down the [nearby] Holloway Road,\u201d she remembers, \u201cbecause the odds you could get on me winning were so good.\u201d Thornberry increased her majority sevenfold. \u201cOne of my activists won so much on his bet he went to South Africa to watch the World Cup.\u201d Recent London elections have been full of such startling Labour successes: Sadiq Khan\u2019s crushing mayoral victory last week; Labour gaining seven London seats in the 2015 general election, despite its failures almost everywhere else; Labour winning a succession of contests for the London Assembly and London borough councils since 2012 by landslide margins. \u201cLondon is a Labour city\u201d has become a political commonplace.           Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor    Yet this dominance has been achieved in a city that, in many ways, feels like a hostile environment for left-of-centre politics. The competitiveness and individualism of London life; the wealth and materialism; the ongoing \u201csocial cleansing\u201d of the capital\u2019s poor by spiralling house prices and cuts to benefits and social housing; the disappearance, decades ago, of most of London\u2019s industrial working class; the increasing difficulty of pursuing alternative lifestyles in the capital; the smaller proportion of trade unionists and public sector workers than in almost every other British region; the seemingly unbreakable supremacy of the City \u2013 to many leftwing academics, hard, shiny London has become Europe\u2019s pre-eminent \u201cneoliberal city\u201d. How has Labour managed to thrive in London? And what, if any, wider lessons does that hold for the party, and for British left-of-centre politics generally? The politics of London - as opposed to Westminster politics - are usually treated by the national media as an electoral quirk or a footnote. Rob Ford, a psephologist and lecturer at Manchester University, says: \u201c90% of political writers are London-based. So, the city\u2019s political mindset is the air they breathe. They just don\u2019t see it. Or they don\u2019t find it interesting.\u201d Yet he goes on: \u201cBritain will arrive at the place where London is, eventually, in its demographics, in its social values, in its politics. In perhaps 20 to 30 years\u2019 time, thanks to immigration and ethnic change and the huge expansion of higher education, the median voter in Land\u2019s End will be much more like a Londoner.\u201d Already, there are signs of London-style Labour politics - socially liberal, multiracial, cross-class, often more enthusiastic about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership than the party as a whole - spreading to cities with significant student and ethnic minority populations, such as Oxford, Southampton, Brighton, Manchester and Bristol, where last week the mayoralty was won by Marvin Rees, a mixed-race Labour candidate close to Corbyn. Simon Woolley of the non-partisan pressure group Operation Black Vote, who followed the Bristol contest closely, says that Rees\u2019s victory was partly achieved by a coalition between black Bristolians and white, liberal incomers from London. Thornberry sees a similar export of Labour people and attitudes from the capital: \u201cI get a lot of activists working for me in Islington who don\u2019t stay long, because they can\u2019t afford to live in London. Then, when I go around the country\u201d \u2013 she is shadow defence secretary \u2013 \u201cI run into activists from Islington.\u201d There are currently 44 Labour MPs with London seats. There will be 45 if the party wins the upcoming by-election in Khan\u2019s former seat of Tooting. This contingent is almost a fifth of Labour\u2019s Commons total, the biggest proportion for decades \u2013 a dramatic change from the Blair-Brown era, when the party was dominated by MPs with seats in its traditional heartlands of Scotland and the north of England. Corbyn himself represents Islington North, next door to Thornberry\u2019s constituency.

London contains a quarter of the activist groups set up by Momentum, the pro-Corbyn mass movement that played an important part in Labour\u2019s successes last week. \u201cCampaigning in London is easier, because of the higher density of Labour members,\u201d says James Schneider, one of Momentum\u2019s chief organisers. Momentum\u2019s founder Jon Lansman is a Londoner. \u201cThere are a disproportionate number of people at the centre of the party from London,\u201d says Simon Danczuk MP, a frequent Corbyn critic, who is currently suspended from the party while he is investigated for allegedly sending lewd texts to a 17 year-old. \u201cJeremy is a very London-centric MP. He has a strong sense that multiculturalism, for example, is healthy and positive. In parts of the north of England, that doesn\u2019t play well at all. The British public generally are conservative with a small \u2018C\u2019. If you offer people in Rochdale what Jeremy\u2019s offering in Islington, you won\u2019t have a Labour MP.\u201d Ford, who is probably the leading authority on why Labour voters outside London have defected to Ukip in damaging numbers in recent years, agrees with Danczuk up to a point. \u201cWhen it comes to social liberalism, C1s [lower middle-class voters] outside London are either not that interested, or it actively pisses them off. And London already has a bloated role in our public life. The spread of London Labour ideas risks feeling like an imposition of values.\u201d Yet amid all the characterising of London Labour as \u201ca metropolitan elite\u201d, in Danczuk\u2019s 2014 description, who have \u201chijacked\u201d the party, it is generally forgotten that they have already fought and apparently won a protracted battle in the capital itself. London used not to be \u201ca Labour city\u201d. London was defined in its current sprawling form, Greater London, by the Conservatives in 1963: in part to offset Labour support in the inner city by including an outer ring of more Conservative suburbs, the \u201cdoughnut\u201d that Boris Johnson decisively gobbled up in his mayoral victories in 2008 and 2012. For decades, London swung wildly left and right, with frequent periods of Conservative ascendancy. During Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1987 election landslide, her illiberal, anti-multicultural government did better in London than in the country as a whole, thrashing Labour by 15%. That year, a despairing document about campaigning in London written by a Labour strategist, Patricia Hewitt, was leaked to the press: \u201cIt is obvious from our own polling, as well as from the doorstep, that \u2026 [being called] the \u2018loony Labour left\u2019 is now taking its toll; the gays and lesbians issue is costing us dear amongst the pensioners and fear of [our alleged] extremism is particularly prominent \u2026\u201d Well into the 90s, Labour\u2019s electoral weakness in the capital - \u201cthe London effect\u201d as it was known by journalists and party insiders \u2013 was seen as a major obstacle to the party regaining national office. As Hewitt\u2019s memo suggested, much of the blame for the \u201cLondon effect\u201d was put on the innovative but intensely controversial pro-diversity policies of the capital\u2019s handful of leftwing local authorities, in particular Ken Livingstone\u2019s Greater London Council, which the Thatcher government abolished in 1986. But as the racial balance of the capital has shifted since, and immigration has accelerated, and Londoners\u2019 attitudes to sexuality have become more liberal, so the more unbuttoned Labour politics pioneered by the GLC has gradually pervaded the party in London and made it seem in tune with the modern city.     Ken Livingstone on the campaign trail. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    \u201cLivingstone was one of the first senior politicians to give black people real power and a voice,\u201d says Woolley. McDonnell was Livingstone\u2019s GLC deputy, and Corbyn was part of the same London leftwing milieu. \u201cI was at a meeting recently in the Caribbean about Britain paying reparations for slavery, which is a big issue there,\u201d says Woolley, \u201cand Corbyn wrote a paper in the 80s about why reparations were right. Some older black voters in London, and places such as Bristol, remember these things.\u201d Younger non-white London also predominantly votes Labour. At the last general election, according to the pollsters Survation, ethnic minority Londoners chose Labour over the Conservatives by 54% to 34%. That was a much-improved Conservative performance, with the party doing particularly well among Sikhs and Hindus; but given the crude and counter-productive racial tone of the Tory mayoral campaign against Khan since, it may not be repeated for years to come. Meanwhile the capital\u2019s perennial population churn has worked in Labour\u2019s favour in recent decades. \u201cWhite migration out of London has weakened the Conservatives,\u201d says Ben Judah, author of This Is London, a new account of immigrant London, much of which takes place in the once heavily white and Tory outer suburbs. \u201cThe Conservative \u2018doughnut strategy\u2019 is a complete misreading of what is happening in outer London, which is almost as poor and multiracial as inner London now.\u201d The capital\u2019s electorate is currently \u201c35% non-white\u201d, says Ford. Any mainstream party associated with anti-racism, as Labour is, potentially has huge appeal. And not just among ethnic minority voters: \u201cIn modern politics, social values increasingly trump economic values,\u201d he continues. \u201cLondon has lots of university graduates on higher incomes who work in the private sector. Their economic self-interest should steer them to vote Tory. But they won\u2019t, because the Tories are \u2018evil\u2019, \u2018racist\u2019. Meanwhile, it\u2019s a badge of honour, voting Labour.\u201d The middle-class leftie has been electorally significant in Britain probably since the late 70s, when Thatcher\u2019s election hid a sudden leap in the upper-income Labour vote; but the expansion of higher education means that there are now far more of them. Where I live in Hackney in east London, now a byword for gentrification, Labour posters sprout every spring in the windows of many of the smartest houses, and last week the party beat the Tories for the local London Assembly seat by 44%, the sort of one-party state result rarely achieved even by the current Scottish National party. Ford says the Conservatives need to understand such well-off urban liberals better, rather than treat them with \u201cquizzical condescension\u201d.           London-wide Assembly Members announced \u2013 video    London\u2019s more youthful, less comfortable middle class also tends to vote Labour. The dysfunctional rental and property markets, the spread of unpaid internships, the particularly obvious need in London for more state spending on overcrowded schools and transport infrastructure \u2013 all of these have drawn young Londoners towards Corbyn\u2019s mildly anti-capitalist Labour party, and that led by Ed Miliband, another middle-class London leftie, before him. \u201c\u2019Neoliberal London\u2019 politicises people,\u201d says Schneider. London today just feels less suited to free-market Conservative solutions than it did in the 80s, when in a more rundown, less teeming city. the glossy Thatcherite promises of upward social mobility and mass property ownership were more alluring. When will Labour lose its hold on London again? The by-election in Tooting, where the Labour majority is a less than impregnable 2,842, may give the party\u2019s enemies some encouragement. Judah offers them one cause for hope: \u201cEastern European immigrants, in my experience, are incredibly reticent about becoming involved in British politics. But in the long term, they\u2019re natural Tory voters: often resentful of unions, and strong identifiers with Margaret Thatcher for her anti-communism.\u201d Yet he acknowledges that other recent immigrants to London, well-educated escapees from southern European countries with troubled economies and strong leftwing traditions, such as Greece and Spain, are more likely to vote Labour. The party\u2019s implosion in Scotland, and unpromising performance in much of England under Corbyn, mean that the micro-trends of London Labour politics will probably have a national significance for years, even decades, to come \u2013 whether Danczuk and the many Labour MP\u2019s and members who share his suspicion of London like it or not. Two years ago, Thornberry was campaigning for Labour in the Rochester and Strood by-election in Kent when she tweeted a photo of a local house with a white van outside and several flags of St George hanging from its facade. Thornberry grew up on a council estate after her middle-class parents divorced, but she is an ex-barrister with a commanding manner. The picture was taken to be sneering and metropolitan, and she was forced to resign as shadow attorney general. At the general election six months later, she massively increased her Islington majority again.",
