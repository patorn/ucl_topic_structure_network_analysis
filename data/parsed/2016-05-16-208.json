  "body": "Welcome to theguardian.com review of the 2015-16 Premier League season. Now that the campaign has ended we would like you to help us choose your favourite goal, the best referee and the best manager, and other winners in a total of 10 categories. We have nominated some contenders but this is just to get the discussion going: we would like your suggestions so that we can compile the best into final polls that you can vote on. The polls will be published at midday on Tuesday 17 May, so please tell us what you think. Thanks The return of the Euro Super League breakaway threat ritual An uncommonly feel-good season epitomised by Leicester smashing the top four cartel would inevitably displease somebody. Sure enough, along came Charlie Stillitano in March, hinting that all this Premier League table-turning is most unsatisfactory, on account of its calamitous impact on revenue projections of the Clubs That Matter. Upon this was pegged the latest European Superleague breakaway hint, and calls for the Champions League to be further restructured to protect the top leagues\u2019 financial elite. \u201cWhat would Manchester United argue: did we create soccer or did Leicester create [it]?\u201d said Stillitano \u2013 supremo of the International Champions Cup pre-season kickabout \u2013 after meeting representatives of Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea. \u201cLet\u2019s call it the money pot created by soccer and the fandom around the world. Who has had more of an integral role, Manchester United or Leicester? It\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful story \u2013 but you could see it from Manchester United\u2019s point of view, too.\u201d As it turned out, the point of view of most United fans, and those of other big clubs, was that Leicester\u2019s triumph was to be welcomed \u2013 Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side were applauded off the pitch at Old Trafford later in the season. The European breakaway threat \u2013 never followed through, but always a handy negotiating pitch for another power and revenue grab \u2013 has become such a regular ritual that it can be inked into the calendar along with World Cups and European Championships \u2013 someone could even commission a wallchart.  Shockingly poor penalties Jamie Vardy\u2019s spectacular penalty miss for Leicester against Everton may have been of little consequence, with both game and title sewn up, but it did serve to spotlight the often ropey standards of marksmanship displayed from 12 yards this season (it also teed up a friend\u2019s pithy Facebook post: \u201cJamie Vardy kind enough to give us all a preview of how England\u2019s Euros will end\u201d). There have been some real howlers from the spot this season \u2013 Oscar against Watford, Wilfried Bony against Sunderland and Santi Cazorla at West Brom being particular standouts \u2013 and only two of the past 20 seasons have there been more outright misses in the top flight than this term\u2019s six: in 2008-09 and 2010-11 (eight).      Oscar, far right, slipped and skied his penalty over the bar during Chelsea\u2019s 2-2 draw with Watford in December.

Whether this has anything to do with the removal from the scene of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho halfway through it can be for others to discuss. Nonetheless, there remains an excessive focus on referees \u2013 their mistakes, foibles and perceived biases - that perhaps most obviously manifested itself in the removal of Kevin Friend from the Stoke v Tottenham match in April, even though Friend supports neither side. However, the fact that Friend (a lifelong Bristol City fan) lives in Leicester and often goes to matches at the King Power Stadium was enough to see him removed from duty at the Britannia Stadium \u2013 following, predictably, a clamour on social media. Aside from the implicit slur on the professionalism of an official who has had a tough season (he collapsed at Bournemouth in March), the decision also reinforced the tendency to regard the referee as a central figure in every match\u2019s drama. The opprobrium heaped on Jon Moss after his erratic performance in Leicester\u2019s tempestuous draw with West Ham last month, including from former members of his own profession, hardly helped either. It would be reassuring to think that the decision to allow referees to explain their decisions to the media next season might calm these storms, though it might also propel officials back into a centre-stage role that they really shouldn\u2019t have.     Jon Moss was harshly criticised for his performance during Leicester City v West Ham, in which the referee sent off Jamie Vardy and awarded a penalty to both sides.

Nonetheless, on 6 April Villa announced the all-important redrawing of the lion on their badge. \u201cLions have been used for centuries as the centre-pieces of coats of arms \u2013 widely perceived as the king of beasts, they stand for values such as bravery, valor and strength,\u201d a club statement enlightened us. \u201cIt\u2019s this spirit that made a heraldic lion the perfect choice by the club\u2019s founders to represent our values.\u201d Easily mockable in the circumstances, obviously, but part of a wider and arguably more malignant trend of corporate repositioning. Similarly, West Ham\u2019s new badge, which adds the words \u201cLondon\u201d to a stripped-down version of the traditional crossed hammers, is clearly an attempt at selling them as a club for the whole capital as they make a move to the Olympic Stadium that was bitterly opposed by many supporters of other clubs in the same city. When clubs are changing so rapidly in so many other ways, the least we can expect is that the simple totems \u2013 such as badge and colours \u2013 remain the same.     At least this fan has another to add to the collection. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters    Clappers  Is anyone going to rain on Leicester\u2019s parade? Unlikely. Nor should they, though the champions really ought to be taken to task for encouraging the pernicious trend of cardboard clapper-clacking that assails eardrums at too many grounds. Leicester took it further by providing clappers on each seat at home games in an attempt to ratchet up an atmosphere the club\u2019s fans proved thrillingly capable of generating all by themselves. As such, clappers represent another attempt to impose corporately sanctioned atmosphere from above rather than trusting supporters to spontaneously create it themselves. Enough.     Clappers and flags were attached to each seat before Leicester\u2019s match with Everton, after which Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side lifted the Premier League trophy.
