  "body": "Amir Khan says he will carry on boxing for \u201cthree or four fights\u201d despite the devastation to body and spirit that Sa\u00fal \u201cCanelo\u201d Alv\u00e1rez visited upon him on Saturday night with the most perfect right hand of his illustrious career.   Related: Amir Khan would be taking a risk after latest knockout, claims Kell Brook    Beaten but not beaten up, down and out in Las Vegas but not in his heart, Khan is convinced he can be a world champion again \u2013 hopefully back at welterweight as the mandatory challenger for Danny Garc\u00eda\u2019s WBC title in December \u2013 and only then, as he turns 30, will he start to think more seriously about retirement. His determination to continue risking his health and reputation, admirable as it might be in pure sporting terms, will frustrate two important people in his life among many: his mother and his biggest rival, Kell Brook. It is no secret that Mrs Khan has been asking him to quit boxing for some time and although Khan makes light of it, she will not be comforted by his insistence that Saturday night\u2019s knockout, which rendered him briefly unconscious and flat on his back in front of 16,000 stunned fans, has left him with no visible damage. \u201cI\u2019m always saying to her: \u2018Two fights, two fights,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been two fights for the last three years. I\u2019m flying home with her and she is going to do my head in the whole way, saying I should retire.\u201d His wife, Faryal, who flew in from New York the morning after the fight, is no great fan of boxing either. \u201cThey\u2019ve both wanted me to retire like a year ago. But I\u2019ve got a few good years left in me and then I\u2019ll retire \u2013 or I\u2019ll get kicked out of the house, or disowned or something. It\u2019s very hard for my family to see my going to the ring. Mum probably hasn\u2019t seen the fight or the knockout but she knows I\u2019ve been hurt and she thinks: \u2018Is he all right?\u2019 It\u2019s very hard for my wife as well. She\u2019s the same, she doesn\u2019t like watching the fights \u2013 it is too much for her really. I have to be smarter now \u2013 instead of jumping two or three weight classes for fights. Maybe I will fight people my own size, because otherwise I might give my mum or my wife a heart attack. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to finish on a loss, I still want to win more fights and be in more big fights. I have worked so hard to get into this position and I want to stay in this position and fight the big names. Five or six more? That\u2019s too much, I think. Mum wouldn\u2019t be happy if I had that many. Maybe three or four.\u201d Brook, though, is not on his wish-list, not even with an IBF title to barter. The mega-fight Brook\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, was within a zero or two of nailing this summer seems further away than ever. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Khan says, briefly irritated by the mention of Brook\u2019s name. \u201cHe is on his own route and I\u2019m on my route. I just don\u2019t think we agree with each other, basically. I don\u2019t like him and I\u2019m not giving him the fight. \u201cHe\u2019s not a big enough draw for me. Eddie Hearn can keep saying he\u2019s massive, he\u2019s this, he\u2019s that but he\u2019s not. I respect him, he\u2019s got a title and everything, but I want to fight the biggest names in boxing during the last few years of my career and leave a legacy. \u201cI\u2019ve set my stall out to be a star in America and I\u2019ve stuck by that. It takes a lot of balls to come out here and fight, because not a lot of fighters do this. I always said I want to come to America and break the market here. I had my first 18 fights in the UK, about 20 in total there, and I\u2019ve had the rest in America. It\u2019s a lot of fights and I\u2019m now hitting the pay-per-view market here. This is a dream for me. It has taken a long time to get here, and now I\u2019m here.\u201d That will satisfy Khan\u2019s personal aims but will leave his British audience cold. He has not fought in the UK since beating Julio D\u00edaz over 12 rounds in Sheffield in 2013. \u201cI\u2019d like to fight in England,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m thinking of taking a big name from over here. Miguel Cotto, for example, that would be amazing.\u201d But will it happen? The politics of the business invariably determine the direction of a fighter\u2019s career, and the bottom line is always money. While the 35-year-old Cotto, whose last fight was a one-sided battering by Alv\u00e1rez over 12 rounds in November, would draw, he is a fading commodity after 45 fights in 15 years.   Related: Amir Khan cleared by hospital and lauded as one of 'bravest fighters on the planet'    It is inconceivable that Khan-Brook would not be a bigger attraction. And the obvious paradox is that fighters who don\u2019t like each other usually make a lot of money sorting out their differences in the ring, instead of indulging in verbal exchanges for free. Still, Khan\u2019s financial and strategic logic for chasing a rematch with Garc\u00eda, who stopped him to take the WBC and WBA light-welterweight titles in 2012, is sound. They share an \u201cadviser\u201d in the still influential but mysterious Al Haymon \u2013 although Haymon\u2019s major client, Floyd Mayweather Jr, might yet spike that event by coming out of retirement to fight Garc\u00eda. Towards the end of a high-octane career, the challenge for Khan is to be more measured in his ambitions and more aware of the danger signs. He can still get the big fights, because he is in favour with Golden Boy Promotions, but it does not want him for the obvious reasons: he brings uncertainty and excitement \u2013 which is fine for those writing the cheques, and not such a safe undertaking for the provider of the requisite thrills. Once banned and fined for driving at more than 140mph on the M62, Khan remains addicted to danger. One thing is undisputed: he is in the right sport.",
