  "body": "Duncan Storrar has responded to the furore that resulted from his question on Q&A, after a week spent \u201chiding from the media\u201d. Storrar provided a statement to ABC\u2019s Media Watch for a program exploring how he had been treated in the media that was broadcast on Monday night. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start this except with what are the lessons for Australia in this episode,\u201d he began the written statement, published in full on the ABC\u2019s website.   Related: Duncan Storrar may just as well have held up a bowl and asked for more | Jeff Sparrow    He wrote that his question on tax-free thresholds had shown politicians to be \u201cout of touch\u201d, and that he had been \u201cdropped, probed and attacked \u2026 with no thought to the mental wellbeing of my children\u201d as a result. He also said that \u201cevery discrepancy\u201d in his life had been exposed in print, ruining his job prospects: \u201cwould you give me a job after a Google search comes up with the headlines of last week and will be used as a example to keep people like me quiet\u201d. He said there had been \u201cserious consequences\u201d of the media coverage and singled out the News Corp press treatment of his \u201cso-called story\u201d, which took in his criminal record, alleged drug use and absent parenting. \u201cI told everybody I talk to that I \u2026 have serious mental issues. Knowing this the rightwing press decided to write the story\u2019s they did without a care for me or my (now ex partner ) mental health \u2026 I ask does News Corp have a mental health policy when it comes to dealing with people like me. Yes they do, they have thrown this out to show the world that power.\u201d He said News Corp knew of his mental health problems and \u201cstill [came] in boots and all\u201d: \u201cIsn\u2019t there a duty of care instilled in the mental health act?\u201d Storrar thanked the \u201cwonderful people of Australia\u201d for supporting him, mentioning those who contributed to a crowdfunding page that raised $60,000. \u201cThank you for making sure my girls have their school needs taken care of. The money will go in a trust fund for school and to charities.\u201d The founders of the Go Fund Me page have asked community service organisations in Victoria for help in establishing a framework to manage the donations.   Related: Duncan Storrar went on Q&A \u2013 now his personal life is dragged through the mud    Storrar concluded his statement by returning to his original question to the Q&A panel: \u201cMy question is still valid and hasn\u2019t been answered.\u201d He wrote that Q&A was \u201cthe only place where people like me can ask questions of our leaders and policy makers ... we don\u2019t have any other contact with these people\u201d. As such, it was \u201cthe most important part of democracy\u201d he had available to him. \u201cThere are a whole class of people out there, yes we might have records, yes we might not be perfect but society has forgotten us the politicians and the media use us whenever they want to show why they need to be elected but never do anything to help our plight. We are breaking down here and life hasn\u2019t been this hard since before Whitlam for the underclass. \u201cThank you Australia for all your support. I didn\u2019t want this.\u201d           The simple question that polarised the Q&A panel",
