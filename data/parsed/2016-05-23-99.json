  "body": "Two former chancellors have dismissed George Osborne\u2019s claims that leaving the EU will cause recession, job losses and lower wages as inaccurate propaganda. A Treasury analysis predicted either a shock or severe shock as a result of Brexit, but the Tory peers Nigel Lawson and Norman Lamont said the department they used to run could not be trusted to come up with accurate forecasts. Lord Lawson accused Treasury civil servants of \u201cprostituting\u201d themselves by producing the figures to suit Osborne\u2019s arguments for staying in the EU. \u201cThe Treasury has enough trouble with forecasts even when they are trying to get them right,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time they have simply assumed a disaster in order to scare the pants off the British people.\u201d   Related: Boris Johnson dismisses Treasury Brexit report as false 'propaganda' - Politics live    Lord Lamont even suggested that Osborne and the Treasury were deliberately undermining economic confidence in order to win their case.  \u201cA lot of the government\u2019s so-called forecast depends on business confidence, which the government is doing its best to undermine. Economists are no better than anyone else in predicting shifts in confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have nothing to fear but fear itself, which the government is doing its best to stir up.\u201d Marcus Fysh, Tory MP for Yeovil, dismissed the Treasury report as \u201cspecious bollocks\u201d, while former defence secretary Liam Fox claimed it was \u201cdisreputable, shabby and misleading\u201d. The Sun reported that two ministers had threatened to resign in protest at Downing Street\u2019s relentless warnings, fuelling more speculation that pro-Brexit MPs could try to force Cameron out after the referendum regardless of the result. In the Treasury document released on Monday, the government predicted a fall in GDP of between 3.6% and 6%; a plunge in the value of sterling; lower house prices; a reduction in wages of between 2.8% and 4%; more than half a million job losses; more borrowing and higher inflation. Launching the report in Hampshire, in a rare appearance alongside Osborne, David Cameron said the British people would be voting to \u201cself-destruct\u201d if they chose to leave the EU, because they would be knowingly choosing a recession.  He also said voting to stay was the moral thing to do and it would not make sense to have undergone \u201cpain and sacrifice\u201d after the 2008 financial crisis just to throw away the progress. \u201cWhere is the morality for putting that at risk for some unknown end? It would be like surviving a fall, then running straight back to the cliff edge \u2026 The self-destruct option,\u201d the prime minister said. But Brexit campaigners immediately began to pick holes in the report, pointing out that Osborne set up the Office for Budget Responsibility because people had no faith in the Treasury\u2019s forecasting.  They also questioned why it focused on the economic downsides, rather than examining potential upsides as well, and failed to model a cut in interest rates to bolster the economy.  The forecasts only compare the scenarios for leaving against what the economy might look like if the UK stayed in \u2013 so GDP is forecast to shrink 3.6% compared with what it might have grown to if the UK voted to remain, rather than compared with its current level.  In addition, the figures assume the UK leaves the single market but negotiates a bilateral EU trade deal, rather than remains in the European economic area, as this is what the official leave campaign is arguing for. Speaking on his Vote Leave bus tour in York, Boris Johnson said the establishment was producing the most propaganda since 1992 \u201cwhen they said that we couldn\u2019t leave the European exchange rate mechanism\u201d.  \u201cThey said it would be a disaster. They said interest rates would go up, they said it would be an economic catastrophe for the economy if we left the European exchange rate mechanism, the Treasury said. And what happened? It was a liberation for this economy,\u201d Johnson said. Cameron and Osborne defended the Treasury\u2019s efforts, saying that it had been independently audited by Prof Sir Charles Bean, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, as the OBR was not mandated to carry out such predictions. Cameron\u2019s warnings were echoed by the chancellor, who argued that the UK must not risk the progress it had made since the 2008 financial crash. \u201cWith exactly one month to go to the referendum, the British people must ask themselves this question: can we knowingly vote for a recession?\u201d said Osborne. Challenged about why he was holding a referendum when the outcome could be so negative, Cameron said it was right to give people a say when they had not been given that chance in a generation.  The feuding between senior Tories took another bitter turn on Monday as Iain Duncan Smith was accused of making an untrue claim that Sajid Javid, the business secretary, secretly backs Brexit.  A source close to Javid suggested Duncan Smith was lying when he told the BBC on Monday that the business secretary had revealed to him that he was in favour of Brexit. \u201cIt is simply not true. Sajid Javid has said no such thing either in private or public,\u201d the source said. Duncan Smith, a former work and pensions secretary, had said he was disappointed with Javid for campaigning to stay in when he privately wanted to leave the EU.",
