Wilmore said to Barack Obama: \u201cYo Barry, you did it, my n---a,\u201d pounding his chest and going in for the brother-love embrace. Doing so, he broke comedic character to tell the president, to a large extent on behalf of black America, how meaningful it has been for us to have seen him in office for the past eight years. Whether viewers agree or disagree with his policies, as Wilmore noted earlier in his bit \u2013 \u201cI agree with the policy that he\u2019s black\u201d \u2013 the embrace represented a moment filled with the vulnerability, truth and power of two black men seeing each other in an America that devalues, profiles, incarcerates and kills them at a startling rate.  I was introduced to the N-word long before I had any real understanding of its association with blackness and black culture. Certainly, when I first heard it from the mouth of a white playground bully in the fourth or fifth grade, I knew it was not meant as a term of endearment. But as a black child adopted into a white family, I had never heard the word and its meaning discussed. It wasn\u2019t until high school, after I\u2019d read James Baldwin and other black writers, interacted with some black kids during summers out of town and listened to hip-hop that I came to realize that it was a word not merely complicated, but intensely fraught. The level of fraughtness is entirely reliant upon who says it and to whom.           Highlights from Barack Obama\u2019s final White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner     Related: President Obama's final White House Correspondents' dinner \u2013 as it happened    I understood that in hip-hop culture, and among many black Americans, the N-word is often used playfully, lovingly. Ta-Nehisi Coates told Heben Nigatu and Tracy Clayton of BuzzFeed\u2019s popular podcast Another Round that \u201cn---a\u201d is his favorite word in the English language. But as an adult and the parent of a 10-year-old son, I still don\u2019t use it or want to hear it.  The obvious reason is that I never heard it spoken to me lovingly. The only context I know for that word is one in which I am being intentionally degraded by white people. The next time I heard it, after the playground, was in high school, when my boss at the local oil company called me a lazy n---er under his breath after I refused to clean the bathroom right after he\u2019d used it. I was a receptionist, not a cleaning person. I believe the word belongs to black people and black culture \u2013 the agency and right to use it if and when and how we want to use it is important. As much as I support and understand Wilmore\u2019s use of it with Obama, and respect that Ta-Nehisi Coates finds magic in a word many people cringe at, I have been very clear with my son that context matters. When he hears Kendrick Lamar say it, or Larry Wilmore, he knows that it\u2019s their prerogative to use the word, and that they are communicating a very specific, deeply rooted kind of affection toward one another.  He also knows that white people are never allowed to use it. While I have been fairly strict with him about his own usage of the word \u2013 not in our house, not with his boys, not even singing along with hip-hop \u2013 the exchange between Wilmore and Obama reminded me of a moment I witnessed and wrote about in an earlier book of mine called Saving the Race, which looks at the legacy of WEB Du Bois in a contemporary context. I was chatting to the journalist LeAlan Jones in New York\u2019s Union Square last year when, when mid-sentence, almost as if it were part of what he was saying to me, LeAlan looked up past my shoulder and said, \u201cHey, Q-Tizzy, what up?\u201d Then, in this one beautiful seamless motion, LeAlan and the man he had just greeted exchanged the graceful palm-to-fingers slide of a familiar handshake. The man kept walking, and LeAlan resumed the sentence where he\u2019d left off with me. A little while later, having recognized the man he\u2019d shaken hands with, I asked him: \u201cSo how do you know Q-Tip?\u201d and LeAlan said: \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d           Obama\u2019s best zingers from last seven White House dinners    It\u2019s not just a familiar handshake \u2013 it\u2019s a black handshake. It\u2019s the physical embodiment of the word \u201cn---a\u201d and it is ours. At a time of heightened awareness and receptivity regarding race and black culture, it felt like Larry Wilmore was saying: \u201cYou can keep degrading us, keep ignoring or killing us, keep pretending that conversations about race will get us where we need to get, but you cannot take this. Not this word, not this gesture. Not our recognition of each other.\u201d And it made me feel a sense of pride \u2013 a sense of black pride.",
