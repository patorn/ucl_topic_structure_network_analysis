I thought as I\u00a0grew up that the world was ready for the positive developments that the inclusion of women in all walks of life and in particular in the power system, would bring. To be sure, there have been some good shifts \u2013 but by and large the dreams of my generation have not been realised. I am backing the Women\u2019s Equality party because I really do not want to die before closing the pay gap, which stands, in our great and supposedly modern capital city, at 23%. We keep being told that closing it is very \u201ccomplicated\u201d. Why?   Related: Women\u2019s Equality party leader Sophie Walker: \u2018It\u2019s complex, but not complicated\u2019    I am backing it, too, because I am shocked that 85% of young women in London are sexually harassed every day. I want my son to see gentleness and caring as manly attributes, and my daughter to see strength of purpose and voice as feminine. I am very worried about the hyper-sexualisation of our children and I do not see that being addressed anywhere else. I am backing the WEP because it is putting issues of caring \u2013 for children and for the elderly \u2013 at the top of its agenda. The WEP wants our economy and our education systems to work fairly for men and women and it wants to see women in positions of authority in equal\u00a0numbers. All the above are at the top of the list of WEP\u2019s priorities and I look forward to helping it with some of its campaigns. I have met and talked with them and a more committed, bright, inspiring bunch of women with fantastic ideas I\u00a0have never found. They are only asking for half my votes in the elections on 5 May, so I can continue to support my old allegiances with the other half. Give half your votes to the Women\u2019s Equality party on 5 May. We\u2019re half the population and equality is way, way overdue.Emma ThompsonLondon \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
