TV Chef\u2019s Table Hip foodie culture isn\u2019t just restricted to the queues outside trendy ramen joints these days: it\u2019s now starting to colonise TV. This Netflix series profiles renowned chefs and their working methods, from Sweden to S\u00e4o Paulo, and features some truly Instagram-perfect cinematography. We\u2019re a long way from Fanny Cradock here, Toto. Exhibitions Martin Creed     Martin Creed, 2016. Photograph: Hugo Glendinning    The Turner prize-winner\u2019s 2014 retrospective at the Hayward was a hot ticket; his next UK solo show is in Somerset, promising new in-situ work, from paintings and films to sculpture and spoken word. Ahead of his new album, Thoughts Lined Up, his band open the show with a live set tonight, too. Dance International Dance Festival Birmingham  The month-long celebration of dance styles from around the world ends this weekend, with three shows offering contemporary takes on South Asian dance and a BIDF debut from British Columbian company Ballet BC. Wrapping up, it\u2019s Desi Grooves, a family-friendly evening of bhangra and Bollywood bangers, on Saturday night. Radio Kate Tempest on Radio 4 Poet, playwright, rapper and fiction writer: it\u2019s hard to keep up with the talented Kate Tempest. So at least now you can kick back for a reading of her new novel, The Bricks That Built The Houses, for Radio 4\u2019s Book At Bedtime. Though considering it\u2019s a fast-paced \u201cmulti-generational tale of drugs, desire and belonging\u201d and millennial restlessness in the capital, you might need an extra dose of Nytol after all. TV Neil Gaiman\u2019s Likely Stories            Neil Gaiman has woven his relentlessly inventive fiction into formats ranging from graphic novels to theatre. He returns to TV this week with a cast to match his pedigree. A quartet of short films see George MacKay, Johnny Vegas, Montserrat Lombard and Rita Tushingham enact Gaiman\u2019s enchanted and sinister visions. This week; a strange metamorphosis in a STD clinic and an elderly woman who needs raw meat to survive. Gaiman\u2019s mastery of claustrophobia and knack for locating the horror in the everyday should suit the tight, economical format perfectly. Film Whit Stillman Q&A From his 1990 socialite comedy Metropolitan onwards, director Whit Stillman has specialised in a very particular form of social satire, lasering in on the micro-melodramas of modern WASPy subcultures. It\u2019s both surprising and fitting then that his latest film leaps back three centuries to the world of a very different chronicler of privileged types: Jane Austen. Austen\u2019s epistolary novel Lady Susan is the template for his period saga Love And Friendship, which follows the widow Susan, who is forced to retreat to her family\u2019s house when scurrilous rumours about her personal life begin to swirl about through high society. Stillman discusses the film in a series of special preview screenings. Exhibitions Tate Liverpool We\u2019d always suggest a jaunt to the Tate\u2019s Merseyside outpost on the Albert Dock, but it\u2019s nigh-on essential at the moment, with a trio of new exhibitions jostling for attention. Francis Bacon: Invisible Rooms offers up the largest display of the painter\u2019s works ever staged in the north of England, and there are also retrospectives of Austrian surrealist Maria Lassnig and the exuberant New York artist Ella Kruglyanskaya. Music Fetty Wap     Fetty Wap    Trap Queen, with its irresistibly catchy whine about \u201cmaking pies with my baby\u201d and uh, dealing drugs together, was one of the runaway hits of 2015. Finally, its intriguingly likable creator, one-eyed New Jerseyan rap chap Fetty Wap, is bringing his neo-thug repertoire to the UK for a tour, starting in Birmingham on Friday, with more rhymes about modern romance. Comedy Katherine Ryan An unfortunate side effect of being a popular comic is that you may get a column in a once-great music mag, where you\u2019ll have to whinge about burgers and Susan Sarandon\u2019s baps. Which is a shame because Ryan\u2019s recent NME gig sold her a little short: she\u2019s a whipsmart comic with a nice line in gossipy snark.",
