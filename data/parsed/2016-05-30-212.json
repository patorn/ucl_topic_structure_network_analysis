  "body": "The Victorian government has called for masks to be banned at protests after a series of violent clashes between far-left and far-right groups marred a planned peaceful anti-racism rally in the Melbourne suburb of Coburg on Saturday. Speaking on ABC radio on Monday, the state\u2019s police minister, Lisa Neville, said masked groups at protests were \u201ca really disturbing trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last few rallies\u201d and \u201csays to me, people not there to peacefully protest but to incite hatred\u201d. It also prevented police from being able to identify people from video footage of the protests, which hampered further investigations. Neville said she would discuss potentially banning masks and flagpoles from protests in a meeting with the chief commissioner of Victoria police, Graham Ashton.   Related: Melbourne protests: seven arrested as clashes erupt between opposing rallies    A number of members of both sides involved in Saturday\u2019s violence \u2013 the anti-Islamic groups United Patriot\u2019s Front and True Blue Crew, and the anti-fascist group Antifa \u2013 wore either full masks or lower-face coverings, with the only outward difference being Australian flag prints on the right, and the odd Guy Fawkes mask on the left. Members of the anti-Islamic groups also carried flags and, when members of both groups slipped around police for a brawl, used their poles as a weapon, prompting police to call for an examination of whether the flagpoles should also be banned. The groups converged on Coburg in response to the Moreland Say No to Racism Rally, a peaceful community protest which went ahead without incident.  That rally, organised by the Moreland councillor Sue Bolton, had been planned for months and had council approval.  It also had the support of Antifa, the banner name for a collection of anarchists, socialists and communists, some of whom have clashed with protesters organised by the United Patriots Front and like groups. In response, the UPF organised a counter-rally to be held at the same time and in the same place, designed to \u201cstop the far left\u201d and \u201cprotect the Australian way of life\u201d. About 500 police officers, including mounted police and the riot squad, worked to separate the two groups but they clashed at least three times. Seven people were arrested: five for their involvement in the clashes, one for carrying weapons, and one for carrying graffiti equipment. Neville said the arrests showed police were able to respond appropriately to the event and said there might be more arrests as police scour CCTV and mobile phone footage of the event. \u201cThese are operational decisions, I think they are very well skilled at doing these, but let\u2019s keep talking to police to say is there anything else they need to make this easier for them without jeopardising the freedoms of Victorians that we want to maintain,\u201d she told ABC radio. The Coburg Traders Association passed a motion of no-confidence in Bolton for refusing to cancel the original rally after it was hijacked by other groups.  Bolton said the peaceful rally she organised, which marched in the opposite direction to the UPF march, had been unfairly conflated with the violent clashes. She said the suggestion she should have cancelled the rally was \u201coutrageous\u201d and said they were not affiliated with those anti-racism protestors who joined in the violence. \u201cIf we cancelled a rally every time the far right decided to have a counter-rally that would give the encouragement that they could determine what we can talk about and what we can\u2019t talk about,\u201d Bolton told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt would be an extremely bad precedent.\u201d She also opposed moves to ban masks at protests, saying she had received a concerned call from a Muslim woman worried that the ban could extend to wearing a niqab. Neville stopped short of saying the rally should have been cancelled, saying, \u201cWe need to be careful that we are not going to ban every protest.\u201d \u201cThere were two very similar groups that every time they get together we have this situation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see these people on the streets of Melbourne, we just don\u2019t, but at the same time we don\u2019t want to ban peaceful protests.\u201d She said she would talk to police about how to manage clashes between groups like the UPF and groups like Antifa. \u201cAs soon as it became clear that the United Patriots Front were involved it became clear that this was going to be a problem and the police were involved \u2026 I don\u2019t think yet we have had a situation where these two groups have come together and we haven\u2019t had violence,\u201d she said.   Related: The UPF and Reclaim Australia aren't 'concerned parents' or a bad joke | Andy Fleming    The Police Association of Victoria has said police need greater powers to control protests and called for a strengthening of the move-on laws, which were repealed by the Andrews government in 2015. The association\u2019s president, Rod Iddles, told AAP it wanted to restore the power for police to proactively move on people at protests who were causing a breach of the peace, as well as \u201ca new law that if you attend a demonstration wearing an article of disguise that\u2019s an offence\u201d. But the attorney general, Martin Pakula, said the current move-on powers were \u201csufficient when it relates to activity that is likely to cause any endangerment to anyone\u201d.",
