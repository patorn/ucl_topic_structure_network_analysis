Nuclear war seemed a very real possibility, so the news in 1980 that, in\u00a0response to the Soviet Union\u2019s ramping up of its weapons, US\u00a0cruise missiles would be stationed at RAF Greenham Common was terrifying. We felt very frightened for our kids. It was an outrage. The following year, I read a notice in the Guardian by Ann Pettitt, who was organising a women\u2019s march from Wales to Greenham in Berkshire, in protest. I desperately wanted to join them \u2013 I\u2019d been a member of CND since the 1960s \u2013 but my teaching job and small children didn\u2019t allow me to. Instead, I went along to\u00a0support them on the day they arrived. There were around 50 women, with men in support, carrying baggage or looking after children. Their role has\u00a0got a bit lost;\u00a0they were some of\u00a0the first feminist men. The women had no plan of action. A couple chained themselves to the fence, but the RAF commander said he didn\u2019t care if they stayed there or not. He said our march was pointless and stupid. The demonstration got almost no publicity, so I decided we needed to\u00a0get Greenham Common properly into the news. Colin, a friend in my local CND group in Sussex, had made a\u00a0missile out of cardboard \u2013 we often used it as a prop in street theatre performances around the county, alongside a CND member dressed up as a\u00a0US general. I\u2019ve seen a few papier-mache missiles in my time, but this\u00a0was the best by far; Colin was a\u00a0perfectionist. We always got lots of\u00a0attention. A couple of weeks later, a few of us drove to Greenham in a Transit van with the missile on the roof. We\u00a0delivered it to the gates dressed in boiler suits and skull masks \u2013 a\u00a0cliche now, but not then. That\u2019s me on the left; behind me is Colin, and on the right is a good friend called Linnie. Both, sadly, are now dead. It was exciting; there was a sense that nothing else was as important as this. I had phoned up all the national newspapers to say that \u201csomething big\u201d was going to happen, and they were a bit pissed off because it wasn\u2019t the dramatic stunt they thought it would be. But, nonetheless, a few days later this photograph appeared on the front page of the Observer and the resulting publicity got the whole Greenham Common protest started. People were looking for a focus for their anxieties, and Greenham was it. I could never have predicted the camp would last 19 years, and have the impact it did.   Related: Chris McClure poses on the cover of Arctic Monkeys\u2019 debut album, 2006    My fears haven\u2019t subsided. I was at the Trident rally this February. Nuclear weapons are inhumanely crazy, a waste of money, and a\u00a0political weapon more than anything. Any country with nuclear weapons is a rogue state. They make\u00a0no strategic sense; it\u2019s about status, not defence. Now, for the first time, it feels a\u00a0real possibility that Britain could get rid of its missiles in my lifetime. It was great to see so many younger people on the demo this year. Online petitions make people feel they\u2019re doing something, but nothing beats direct action: getting cold, wet, muddy and scared. \u2022 Interview: Hannah Booth Are you in a notable photograph?
