  "body": "Wednesday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood George Cinq (4.00) is a tricky horse to catch right and he has the Timeform squiggle to prove it, but he showed his best form for some time on his latest start, when Tom Marquand switch from his normal waiting tactics to front-running.   Related: Horse racing tips: Wednesday May 25    Marquand is back in George Cinq\u2019s saddle today at Lingfield, and while a more patient ride may be needed with three opponents in the field who like to force the pace, it is just possible that this will be the start of a useful partnership between horse and rider. George Cinq\u2019s handicap mark of 87 is testament to a fair level of ability and he has run well from higher marks in the past. Sophistica (2.30) is also with a new yard after moving from Mick Channon to Iain Jardine and does not have much to find if fit for her seasonal debut at Hamilton, while in the absence of Bouclier, The Big Lad (8.20) has an obvious chance in the sprint handicap at Kempton. Mystical Sapphire (7.20) has joined Laura Mongan since her latest start at Kempton on 2 March, when she was touched off by Three Gracez from a mark of 76, and her course form is excellent. Tipping competition, day three Our winners so far: Monday Final Venture 7-2 Outback Blue 14-1 The Tin Man 3-1 Tuesday Ickymasho 11-4 Benissimo 7-2 Swashbuckling 6-1 And our leader is: dean055 +7 \u2026 who was the only one to find Swashbuckling, taking his total for the week to three winners. Next up is stanflashman (+5.50). Today, we\u2019d like your tips, please, for these races: 3.50 Market Rasen, 7.10 Newton Abbot, 8.20 Kempton. This week\u2019s prize is a pair of tickets to Epsom\u2019s Duchess Stand for Derby day a week on Saturday, 4 June.
