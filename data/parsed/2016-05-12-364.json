The move is designed to get around last month\u2019s supreme court ruling that detention of the almost 900 men is illegal and unconstitutional, and reportedly offers them freedom to go into the nearby town of Lorengau.  The PNG immigration department made the announcement on Thursday, the ABC reported, with deputy chief migration officer Esther Gaegaming claiming \u201cno asylum seeker or refugee is in detention\u201d. But Iranian journalist and Manus Island detainee Behrouz Boochani said there had been no new announcement to the detainees, and freedoms remained restricted.   Related: This is Manus Island. My prison. My torture. My humiliation | Behrouz Bouchani    Boochani said a bus went into Lorengau from outside the prison three times a day, and had done since a few days after the court decision. There had been no new announcement in recent days, beyond a case manager flagging a \u201ccultural program\u201d for detainees who wished to visit Manus villages and learn about PNG culture, he said. \u201cWe can only use the bus on these times for going to town, and also we need to write a request form and wait for their response,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Detainees were told of the bus service after the court decision. \u201cWe cannot go outside freely because around the centre is navy area,\u201d he said.  He also said some people with negative refugee claims had been permitted to go into Lorengau, despite the new arrangement reportedly allowing only for those who agree to resettle in PNG. Restrictions on inter-compound movement between the separated groups of those with approved refugee claims and those whose claims were rejected, remained in place, Boochani added, and he had seen an increased police presence on the island. The PNG immigration minister could not be reached for comment.  Ian Rintoul, spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, dismissed the new regulations. \u201cPapua New Guinea can open the gates to fulfil some technicality, but people are not free to move out of the detention centre wherever they like,\u201d he told Reuters. The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, on Thursday morning directed reporters\u2019 questions to the PNG authorities, but reiterated his view that Manus was the responsibility of PNG. However he confirmed Australia still provided for the services which ran it, and said there would be no renegotiation of contracts based on its new \u201copen\u201d nature. \u201cWe obviously provide funding to the PNG Government and to organisations to provide those health services, those meals, all those services that are provided,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you\u2019re aware there\u2019s no detention on Nauru. It\u2019s an open arrangement there, 24/7 open centre arrangement, and if PNG are heading down that track well that\u2019s really an issue for the PNG Government to comment on.\u201d The supreme court ruling threw the offshore processing agreement between Australia and PNG into disarray, both governments claiming the other was responsible for the \u2013 now illegally \u2013 detained men. High-level talks have been held between the two governments to determine a response, although Dutton this week said he did not see it being resolved until after the federal election. He also said the supreme court did not rule that Manus \u201cneeded to close\u201d. He had previously flagged that an \u201copen centre\u201d style arrangement, like that on Nauru, could address the court\u2019s concerns. The court ruling called for both the Australian and PNG governments to \u201ctake all steps necessary to cease and prevent the continued unconstitutional and illegal detention\u201d. The following day the PNG prime minister, Peter O\u2019Neill, announced the centre would close. In the space of one day the internal gates of the facility were opened, allowing detainees to move freely between compounds and use phones without retribution, and then shut again just hours later, separating people with different determinations. On Friday PNG\u2019s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Fred Sarufa, fronted the UN for PNG\u2019s universal periodic review. Sarufa told the panel PNG accepted the court ruling and was working to make \u201cappropriate arrangements\u201d.",
