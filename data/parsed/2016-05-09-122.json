Sure, travelling abroad isn\u2019t quite as exciting as it once was, now that we can all order jeans from Japan and cookies from Canada over the internet. But there remain other factors that definitely make it worth flashing the cash, or at least the credit card with absurd abroad charges, when you travel. So let\u2019s talk the US, a place I know quite a bit about, and a place where I know even more about the shopping. Now, as this is a fashion column I promise I will get to fashion. But it would be remiss of me not to mention that the number one thing I stock up on when I go to the US is the food. Sure, things have improved since the dark days of the 90s, when I had to import Oreos personally and quite possibly illegally across the Atlantic. But there are still some essentials that it is impossible to buy in Britain without forking over 10 times their worth in weird food specialist shops in Kensington. Major food groups, such as Chex cereals, Reese\u2019s Pieces (only Cups available in the UK! Oh cruel world!) and Kraft Caramels still require personal importing. Most importantly of all, Entenmann\u2019s Creme-Filled Cupcakes, which are about as fake-tasting \u2013 and therefore delicious \u2013 as they sound. God, sometimes I really miss the US. But I can\u2019t sit around talking about cupcakes all day (or can I? Maybe?). So let\u2019s talk LA shopping. Now, the first and most obvious thing to say is that US labels are cheaper in the US than the UK \u2013 even Gap works out cheaper. But where the savings really come into play is with jeans. High-end denim lines, such as Rag & Bone and J Brand, are crazy expensive these days, but they are INSANELY expensive in Britain. My favourite jeans brands are Paige and Frame, but not even someone who once spent \u00a310 on a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the UK will pay \u00a3200-\u00a3300 for a pair of jeans, which is what those labels cost here. I mean, I like macaroni cheese, but I\u2019m not completely crazy. (Happily, you can now buy Kraft Macaroni for \u00a32.50 from Ocado! Bless you, modern era! You don\u2019t get these kinds of useful tips from Vogue, do you?) In the US, these jeans are less than $200, giving you a saving of on average \u00a3100, which is simultaneously exciting and enraging. It is infuriating when you realise how much you are being ripped off at home. My other LA shopping tip is: don\u2019t bother with shopping malls. Sure, they are convenient but the point of shopping abroad is at least as much the experience as the purchases, and you can go to a shopping mall anywhere. It is so much more fun to go to distinctly LA shopping places, such as Melrose Place, with its designer shops that have cactus gardens in front, and Robertson Boulevard, the site of a million Paris Hilton pap shots. Most importantly, you have to visit Rodeo Drive and run into the designer boutiques and shout at the shop assistants, \u201cBig mistake. Big. Huge!\u201d Honestly, they love that there, and you can explain just how much to Homeland Security as they escort you and your purchases out of the country. *** I recently had a thing with a guy who was sending super flirty emails and texts for months and months, but he has recently pulled away with no explanation. What\u2019s going on? Every woman on the planet, ever     Power trip \u2026 sending flirty texts then retreating is particularly idiotic male behaviour. Photograph: Alamy    God, I hate men. Yeah, that\u2019s right \u2013 I SAID IT. Don\u2019t give me any of your #notallmen crap, I blame all of you for this, you and you and especially you with the sleeve tattoos at the back. For every one story I\u2019ve heard of a woman doing this weird flirt-then-disappear act, I\u2019ve heard at least 15 stories of men doing it, and that\u2019s why I blame all men, because you nice guys should tell your male friends to stop it. For some it\u2019s a power trip thing, because these guys find the power of retreating from a woman more erotic than having actual sex with her. For others, it\u2019s a fear of commitment. And for the rest, they enjoyed the fantasy of the woman better than the reality. These are all long-winded ways of saying that these guys are idiots. Here\u2019s all you need to know, ladies: don\u2019t take this behaviour personally. It\u2019s really, really, really not about you. I don\u2019t know this guy but I guarantee he\u2019ll be back in three months with an email that begins \u201cHey\u201d. (Nothing worse than a contrite email that begins \u201cHey\u201d \u2013 nothing!) Do with that email what he did to you: put it in the trash.
