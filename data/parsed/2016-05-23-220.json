  "body": "The Ash Plant He\u2019ll never rise again but he is ready.Entered like a mirror by the morning,He stares out the big window, wondering,Not caring if the day is bright or cloudy. An upstairs outlook on the whole country.First milk-lorries, first smoke, cattle, treesIn damp opulence above damp hedges \u2013He has it to himself, he is like a sentry Forgotten and unable to rememberThe whys and wherefores of his lofty station,Wakening relieved yet in position,Disencumbered as a breaking comber. As his head goes light with light, his wasting handGropes desperately and finds the phantom limbOf an ash plant in his grasp, which steadies him.Now he has found his touch he can stand his ground Or wield the stick like a silver bough and comeWalking again among us: the quoted judge.I could have cut a better man out of the hedge!God might have said the same, remembering Adam.        Seamus Heaney\u2019s father, Patrick Heaney, represents a moral touchstone in the poet\u2019s work. We meet him first in Digging (from Death of a Naturalist in 1966) as \u201chis straining rump among the flower-beds / Bends low, comes up twenty years away\u2026\u201d This sets the tone of future recollection, a combination of gentle amusement and deep, even emulatory, respect. It continues even into the transcendent elegies and visionary speculations of his 1991 collection, Seeing Things.  Nonetheless, a new strand of filial feeling now complicates the weave: the father acquires more than one kind of mythic status as he moves through the collection, sometimes as a shade, sometimes as a bright soul: a mediator between earth and heaven, Christianity and classicism.  The collection begins with a poem called The Golden Bough, translating lines 98-148 of Book VI of Virgil\u2019s Aeneid. (Faber has since published the complete Book VI). Here, the Sibyl tells Aeneas, who wants to visit his father Anchises in Hades, that \u201cTo go down into earth\u2019s hidden places,\u201d the seeker must first find the sacred bough and pluck \u201cthis golden-fledged tree-branch out of its tree\u201d. The branch will come away easily, provided Fate has given her consent.  The \u201cgolden bough\u201d image is grafted on to the last stanza of The Ash Plant, and a reverse journey ensues. Now it\u2019s the dead father who will \u201cwield the stick like a silver bough\u201d and so be able to move among the living. Traditionally, the ashplant, a stick with a natural \u201chandle\u201d provided by the angle of the sapling\u2019s root, had a number of practical uses. For Patrick Heaney, cattle dealer and small farmer, it would have served to help him control his livestock. The poem seems to suggest the same ashplant also made a handy walking stick for Patrick in later life.  Heaney was writing in 1986, two years after his father\u2019s death, and four years after his mother\u2019s. Later in the collection, in the first poem of the Lightenings section of the four-part sequence, Squarings, he imagines \u201ca shivering beggar\u201d trying to shelter in a ruined, roofless house. This is the condition of the adult child who, parentless, has nothing to stand between himself and cold infinity. The Ash Plant might be an accommodation with that existential loneliness. It recounts a process different from the retrievals of memory, although memory is certainly part of it. A mystical act of imagination heightens the remembering and so forms a new present. The poet is now \u201cSeeing Things\u201d that are not past but a continuation of existence on a different plane.   Five solid quatrains, the wonderfully effortless ABBA half-rhyme, a firm pentameter beat, and the emphasised cadence of numerous feminine line-endings: these building blocks have and contain the density of the real world, but they signify more. The father in the poem is waking up after his death, \u201cEntered like a mirror by the morning.\u201d He is uncertain, a new shade, unmoored from life but not far beyond it, like a sentry \u201cunable to remember / The whys and wherefores of his lofty station\u201d (as a sentry\u2019s ghost might be perplexed in a Northern Ireland of future ceasefire). Then \u201chis wasting hand\u201d finds \u201cthe phantom limb\u201d of the ashplant and \u201c\u2026 he has found his touch and can stand his ground\u201d. It\u2019s a lovely image that suggests a frail old man in his later years taking up his stick and, in that moment, finding his balance and becoming sure on his feet, as if recovering a younger body. The shade is transfigured, and, light-filled, he gains full authority. And once again the son gently smiles at the father and teases him as \u201cthe quoted judge\u201d for his dry comment, \u201cI could have cut a better man out of the hedge!\u201d  The comment may have originally signalled the father\u2019s dismissal of the ash-cutting skills of a fellow dealer: it could also have been an old man\u2019s criticism of the medically prescribed walking-stick. A bold shift of context raises the stakes. \u201cGod might have said the same, remembering Adam.\u201d The poet not only gives the father further status as moral arbiter: he presents an idea of resurrection and judgment that might or might not guarantee redemption of the soul.   Related: Seamus Heaney\u2019s final work \u2013 \u2018Death\u2019s dark door stands open \u2026 \u2019     In the Crossings section of Squarings, Patrick will more firmly acquire an identity as guiding and guardian spirit. \u201c\u2018Look for a man with an ashplant on the boat,\u2019 / My father told his sister, setting out / For London, and stay near him all night // And you\u2019ll be safe\u2019.\u201d In these poems written in memoriam, Heaney conjures human decency at its fullest weight and pitch, and invokes a continuous present where \u201cdealing men with sticks\u201d become mysterious mentors. Patrick might be seen as a kind of Virgil to his son\u2019s Dante, but an important difference is that this man isn\u2019t a poet. Heaney once told an interviewer that his father \u201cregarded speech as a kind of affectation\u201d. His duties in life were not to language but to the things of the earth \u2013 bricks and mortar, tools, horses, hedges, cattle. And the poet, although at a remove, has always known these same things, and known he won\u2019t fail as an artist if he remains faithful to his respect for them. Because of its title, Seeing Things is sometimes considered dualistic, polarised between real and delusory acts of seeing. But in postulating a world other than the one immediately sensed, the poet is not doing anything essentially different from the reconstruction of the past in those hidden images we call memories. The sightings poetry unveils are not necessarily obedient to simplistic battle lines of fact versus fantasy, ashplants versus golden boughs.  \u2022 The Ash Plant is taken from Seeing Things \u00a9 Estate of Seamus Heaney and reprinted with permission of Faber and Faber Ltd.",
