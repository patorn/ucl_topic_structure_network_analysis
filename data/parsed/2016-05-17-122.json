  "body": "A mother who stabbed to death her two young daughters \u201cin a spasm of violence\u201d has been jailed for a minimum of 24 years. Samira Lupidi, 24, sobbed uncontrollably as she was found guilty of murdering Jasmine, 17 months, and Evelyn, three, at a women\u2019s refuge. The Italian national admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denied murder. The jury at Bradford crown court took 90 minutes to convict her of the more serious charge on Tuesday afternoon. There were shouts of \u201cyes\u201d from the public gallery when the verdict was returned. Lupidi, who appeared fragile throughout the week-long trial, wept loudly as she was escorted by a security officer. Sentencing Lupidi, Mr Justice Edis acknowledged she had been suffering from a depressive disorder at the time of the \u201cviolent rage\u201d that led to the killings. The judge said: \u201cAll the evidence positively shows that these children were the centre of your life and that you loved them. You were a very good mother to them and cared for them very well.\u201d  He added: \u201cIn the end, humanity requires an allowance to be made for the fact that you killed the things you loved in a temporary rage which will have everlasting and disastrous consequences for you.\u201d  Following the sentencing, relatives of Evelyn and Jasmine said they had been left utterly devastated by the events of last November. They said: \u201cWe were preparing to celebrate Evelyn and Jasmine\u2019s christening with their great-grandparents who had flown in from Italy for the special occasion. \u201cIt should have been a joyous time but instead Evelyn and Jasmine were cruelly taken away from us. We will all remember that day. Our lives are now filled with sorrow and our broken hearts will never heal.\u201d  During the trial, jurors heard that Lupidi stabbed her two children nine times each with a 25cm (10in) kitchen knife before telling staff at the women\u2019s refuge: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have them, he can\u2019t have them either.\u201d Lupidi, who moved to Bradford four years ago, told police the day before the killings that she had been physically assaulted by her \u201cfinancially and psychologically controlling\u201d partner, Carl Weaver, 31. She told officers who visited her home address in Heckmondwike, near Bradford, on 16 November last year that she had been hit on her arm and her legs by her partner, who is the father of the two children. The officers noted that she did not appear to have injuries following the alleged assaults but took her and her daughters to a women\u2019s refuge for her own safety, jurors were told.  When she got to the safehouse, Lupidi told domestic violence workers that Weaver would kill her and the children if he found them. They were reassured that they were safe and spent the night there. The following morning a support worker knocked on her bedroom door and Lupidi rushed out with her hands \u201csmeared with blood\u201d. Lupidi was heard to say: \u201cThey won\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve killed them\u201d as she ran out of the flat shouting on her mobile phone. She is then alleged to have said: \u201cI killed them. I hurt them. I killed the children.\u201d The children were rushed to Bradford Royal infirmary but both were pronounced dead soon after their arrival. Each girl had suffered nine separate stab wounds to the heart and lungs, the court heard. The knife was found on Lupidi\u2019s bed. In the moments after the girls were found, Lupidi was asked when it had happened. She responded: \u201cJust now,\u201d before saying: \u201cIt\u2019s his fault \u2013 now he has a reason to kill me. If I can\u2019t have them, he can\u2019t have them either.\u201d The court was told she added that she feared Weaver was coming to get her, and said: \u201cI had to do this.\u201d Peter Moulson QC, prosecuting, told the jury that after Lupidi was arrested and taken to the police station, she told the custody officer: \u201cI know what I have done. My life is nothing now.\u201d Lupidi, who was absent for her sentencing, did not give evidence in the trial. The judge said Lupidi had killed Evelyn first and then her sister. \u201cJasmine, you later said, had been crying while you were killing her sister in a way she had never cried before,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt does not take much imagination to know what happened in that dreadful scene, and the way in which Jasmine died has traumatised their father who has only just learned of it.\u201d \u201cYou had formed a delusional belief that you were in danger of being killed and that you were going to be abandoned and that you would not see the children again.\u201d  He said she did not turn up to an appointment to discuss eldest daughter Evelyn\u2019s educational needs for fear she would have the children taken from her.He said: \u201cThis was because you were alone, friendless in a foreign country and had, because of your delusions, come to regard the Weaver family as your enemy.\u201cThe killings were caused as you said almost immediately afterwards, because you reacted to this very difficult situation by saying \u2018If I can\u2019t have them, neither can he\u2019.\u201d Evelyn and Jasmine were described by their family as \u201ctypical toddlers always wanting to play, always smiling and happy but never that far from being mischievous\u201d. The family added: \u201cThey have been robbed of their precious lives and we as a family have been robbed of the opportunity to see those beautiful little girls grow into beautiful young women. They were loved deeply and are missed terribly. \u201cWe would like to take this opportunity to thank West Yorkshire police for their personal support and kindness throughout our ordeal. Without their help the last six months would undoubtedly have been even more difficult during what has been a devastating time.\u201d DI Richard Holmes said of Lupidi: \u201cThe reasons for her drastic actions may never be fully known, but she will now have some time to consider the consequences and I hope that the families of Evelyn and Jasmine can find some comfort in this verdict.\u201d",
