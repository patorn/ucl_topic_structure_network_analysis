  "body": "Birmingham welcomed a record-breaking 1 million overseas visitors in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, with an increase of 163,000 visitors (or 17.3%) on 2014 \u2013 the largest rise in visitor numbers for any UK city outside London, for the second year running. The research reveals that the city is the fourth most visited place in the UK by international tourists after London, Edinburgh and Manchester. These numbers are matched by a significant increase in consumer spending in the city. Last year, foreign visitors spent \u00a3386m, up \u00a387m on the previous year. Business travel to Birmingham rose by almost 20% in 2015, with 619,000 visits recorded. Again, this is the largest rise of any UK regional city.  More than \u00a31bn has been invested in the region in the past year, with new developments including the New Street station transport hub, which is home to the new Grand Central shopping centre. A string of high-profile art and sporting events also took place during 2015, such as the 25th anniversary of Birmingham Royal Ballet and 50 years of the contemporary art gallery Ikon, as well as matches during the Rugby World Cup and the Ashes Test series. There are currently 14 hotels in either the planning or construction phase in Birmingham, including the refurbishment of the famous Grand Hotel, which will have 152 new bedrooms when it is finished, in 2018.  Birmingham continues to promote itself vigorously to international markets. In recent months the city has welcomed media delegations from countries including Japan, South Africa, India, Iceland and Belgium.  Put off by the cost of living in London, a growing number of people have moved to Birmingham in recent years, resulting in a growth in new businesses. The Digbeth area, once a centre for heavy industry, is now home to the Custard Factory, the creative industries hub which is also becoming a cultural destination. And the Jewellery Quarter has become a tourist attraction in its own right. The city also boasts several Michelin-star restaurants. Television series Peaky Blinders, based in 1920s Birmingham, has also caused a spike in interest. In a recent interview with Guardian Travel, its creator, Steven Knight, talked fondly about the city\u2019s much-derided aesthetic. \u201cSpaghetti Junction is the most beautiful thing you\u2019ve ever seen at night,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous, and shows that \u2013 when looked at in a certain way \u2013 something that\u2019s considered to be conventionally ugly is actually beautiful. That\u2019s Birmingham.\u201d Guardian writer Stuart Jeffries, who has lived and worked in Birmingham, said the city is definitely \u201chaving a moment\u201d, and also mentioned the \u201cPeaky Blinders effect\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t move in Broad Street these days for promenading Beau Brummies in tweed caps with cunningly concealed razor blades, wishing they were Cillian Murphy as they head off for an evening of culture at Symphony Hall, a gig at the Custard Factory, or a private view at the Ikon Gallery, before heading off to one of the city\u2019s several Michelin-star restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m exaggerating, but only slightly.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe great thing about Birmingham, and perhaps this is one reason it\u2019s more of a destination for tourists, is that its hubristic leaders have a rage for reinventing the place. As a result, it\u2019s not so much a city as a palimpsest of giddy, if failed, utopias. Why go to Birmingham? Why not go to Birmingham?\u201d Jon Bounds, the founder of Birmingham blog Paradise Circus, said he wasn\u2019t surprised the city was seeing the biggest increase of visitors after the capital, \u201cas it is literally the next stop after London\u201d. \u201cBirmingham has been getting a better class of publicity recently, in all things apart from the performance of the city council,\u201d he said.  \u201cMaybe people have even been attracted by the success of Peaky Blinders, which is odd, as Crossroads never brought many tourists: even though it advertised the fact we had a motel. The swarms of visitors must really like building works, and canals, and building works near canals. And self-deprecation.\u201d",
