Keith Hackett\u2019s verdict 1) While it\u2019s tempting to look the other way, you\u2019re there to apply the laws fairly and consistently. If a player removes his shirt (or covers his head with it) to celebrate a goal he must be cautioned \u2013 no exceptions. As he has disappeared down the tunnel already, you\u2019ll have to advise him in the dressing room area that he has earned a second yellow. Request a PA announcement to tell the crowd what has happened, and that his team will play the second half with ten men. You may also need to report him for leaving the field without permission (another yellow card offence) if he crossed the line before you blew for half-time. Thanks to Rafi Addlestone. 2) The player was out of control, so you have to show him a second yellow, followed by a red. Players should understand that they have a duty of care towards opponents. As for the striker \u2013 have a strong word with him: you don\u2019t need his advice on how to referee the game, and by failing to take evasive action he has endangered himself for no good reason. The defender would have been shown a yellow for his reckless challenge whether or not contact was made. Thanks to Ryszard Kaleta. 3) First, tell him to stop screaming. Second, check with your assistant in case he saw anything you missed. Assuming he didn\u2019t, the goal stands. You can only work on the confirmed information available to you \u2013 Hawk-Eye saw the ball cross the line, and that\u2019s all you know for sure. You can\u2019t start basing your decisions on mysterious patterns on the ball, or on who may or may not have muddy hands. Thanks to Mark Bladon.
