In the 1960s, Chinatown was a vibrant, messy place. The sidewalks spilled over with fishmongers and fruit sellers. There were mom-and-pop grocery stores, benevolent societies, dim sum places, gambling parlours \u2013 even the alleyways had restaurants. \u201cThe isolation would\u2019ve slowly killed all of it. And not just here. Strathcona would be gone, Gastown too. We had no choice but to fight,\u201d Chan says. Announced in 1967, the freeway was part of a larger urban renewal scheme to modernise Vancouver\u2019s road network and revitalise its then-struggling inner city. Had it gone through, the scheme would have razed vital neighbourhoods and built massive elevated roadways with an LA-style cloverleaf interchange.     Vancouver is now a mainstay of global liveability studies. Photograph: George Rose/Getty    Such a plan seems unthinkable today. Known for its embrace of public space and pedestrian- and bike-friendly planning, Vancouver is the only major North American centre without an inner-city freeway. Gastown and Chinatown together form the cultural heart of the postcard-beautiful downtown peninsula.  But in the 1960s, Vancouver was a provincial outpost in Canada\u2019s far west, the car was ascendant, and urban planning was in the thrall of modernism. Thinkers such as Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, with his emphasis on master planning, and American town planner Robert Moses, with his tear-it-down-and-build-it-up approach to urban renewal, were influential with city governments across the continent. Vancouver was no exception.  The city grew quickly after the second world war, and by the mid-60s the population approached one million. As car ownership spiked, people and businesses started to move out of the centre. The downtown business district began to stagnate, and the inner-city neighbourhoods, already dense and poor, continued their decline. Fast, direct arterial roads that would link downtown to the burgeoning suburbs, and link Greater Vancouver to the Trans-Canada Highway \u2013 then under construction \u2013 seemed like the obvious solution. Large-scale redevelopment was packaged with the freeways as an opportunity for a blank slate. \u201cThe thinking at the city was, tear down the blight areas and replace them with new, cleaner, better housing for the poor, and you increase access for the middle classes too,\u201d says Gordon Price, director of Simon Fraser University\u2019s city programme.     A new freeway in the 1960s would have cut through Vancouver\u2019s Chinatown. Photograph: FPG/Getty Images    The process had begun in the early 60s. Parts of Strathcona, a working class immigrant enclave, were bulldozed to build a public housing project. Nearly a thousand residents, about a third of the population, were relocated. Shirley Chan\u2019s mother, Mary Lee Chan, organised some of the first protests. \u201cAs a kid, I remember going door to door as a translator for my mother, handing out flyers, hosting meetings at our house,\u201d Chan says. But it wasn\u2019t until the city council announced the more ambitious \u2013 and destructive \u2013 freeway plan in 1967 that the resistance reached a tipping point.  Following the announcement, hundreds of people marched through Chinatown, singing protest songs and brandishing anti-freeway signs. \u201cThe Chinese community was well-represented. My mother and Harry Com [another organiser] made sure of that. But there were people from across the city. Academics, architects, students, teamsters, business people. Everyone had their different reasons,\u201d Chan says. By then she was a university student and a community organiser in her own right. City Hall, led by mayor Tom Campbell and chief planner Gordon Sutton-Brown, both establishment stalwarts, took a dim view of the opposition. The protesters were dismissed as left-wing malcontents: \u201cMaoists, communists, pinkos, left-wingers and hamburgers,\u201d in Campbell\u2019s memorable, if slightly puzzling, formulation later on. At the same time, there was anxiety within the city because it had not yet secured extra funding needed from the federal and provincial governments for the project to go ahead.      Video: Freeway protests in Vancouver in the 1960s   City Hall grudgingly held public consultations while organisers within the protest movement made a point of demonstrating the breadth of the growing coalition. \u201cWe used subtle tactics, [for example] bussing in senior citizens from Chinatown so they could be heard,\u201d says former British Columbia premier Mike Harcourt, who cut his teeth as the movement\u2019s unofficial legal council. The early leadership of Walter Hardwick, a respected urban geographer, and the support of Peter Oberlander, the Town Planning Commission chair who retired his post in protest at the plan, loaned credibility to the anti-freeway movement, as did that of forward-thinking business leader Art Philips.  Oberlander wasn\u2019t the only ally within the municipal government. Darlene Marzari, a social planner with the city at the time, used her position to sabotage the effort to win over Strathcona residents. \u201cMy job was to relocate hundreds of Chinese families, to convince them the plan was okay. Instead I helped convince them to organise against us,\u201d she says.  City council meetings now regularly overflowed with hundreds of concerned citizens. The Chinatown Freeway Debates, as the raucous, often confrontational sessions came to be known, continued for the rest of the year.  The first major blow to the freeway plan came in November 1967. The city was lobbying the federal minister for transport and housing, Paul Hellyer, for his support. A tour of the \u201cblight\u201d areas of downtown was arranged to help him understand the need for the project. Marzari and Chan managed to infiltrate the tour.

They\u2019re good.\u2019 I told him the community had not been consulted, we were not happy about being moved from our homes. The people who had already been moved felt totally cut off.\u201d  That same day, Hellyer announced a nationwide freeze on federal funding for urban renewal. It was an early victory for the anti-freeway movement in what would be a six-year battle. Along the way, the movement become more ambitious in its goals. The focus shifted from merely stopping the expropriation of inner-city neighbourhoods to challenging its very approach to planning.     The dirty secret is that the freeway would\u2019ve gone ahead if the money had been there  Gordon Price     \u201cThe city simply looked south of the border and adopted what Americans did, 10 years later. There was no critical thinking, no consultation,\u201d says Dr V Setty Pendakur, professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia\u2019s School of Community and Regional Planning, and a former activist. \u201cYou only needed to drive to Seattle to see how freeways choked the life out of neighbourhoods.\u201d Drawing on the experiences of local residents and the input of experts like Hardwick and Oberliner, the movement coalesced around the idea that neighbourhoods should be at the heart of city planning. The Electors\u2019 Action Movement (Team) was formed to contest the municipal elections. They won two seats on city council in 1968 \u2013 a moral victory but not enough to change the way things were done at City Hall.  The city continued to push the freeway plan, revising the proposal several times over the next few years without ever seriously addressing the movement\u2019s larger concerns. During this time, the Dunsmuir and Georgia viaducts, twin 800m stretches of elevated roadway, were built on the edge of Chinatown, with the idea that they would eventually connect to the freeway in whatever form it finally took. Still, federal funding was not forthcoming.      Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver in the 1960s. Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images    \u201cThe protests were important,\u201d Price says, \u201cbut the dirty secret is that the freeway would\u2019ve gone ahead if the money had been there.\u201d Tensions between the two sides culminated in a confrontation at the grand opening of the viaducts in 1972. Protesters formed a human chain to block city officials as they made the inaugural trip across the new roadway.  By then, anti-freeway sentiment was widespread in Vancouver and across Canada \u2014 Toronto was fighting its own battle, against the proposed Spadina Expressway. Team swept to power a few months later, winning a majority of seats on city council. Philips was elected mayor. Harcourt, Marzari and Pendakur also found themselves moving from the front lines to council chambers.  \u201cThe first thing we did was fire the planning department and let the freeway project die,\u201d Harcourt says. It was a turning point in Vancouver\u2019s history. Team ushered in a number of reforms and initiatives. For a few heady years in the 70s, planning was radically consultative, centred around the city\u2019s 20 or so neighbourhoods, with gentle densification \u2013 of the kind being championed by Jane Jacobs in Toronto \u2013 the order of the day. \u201cWe brought planners out into communities to work with them on everything from traffic patterns to zoning to housing development,\u201d Marzari says. The city acquired huge amounts of parkland, setting up agricultural land reserves that to this day act as bulwarks against overdevelopment. Many of Vancouver\u2019s signature attractions, including Granville Island, False Creek and the seawall, were developed or revitalised in the wake of the anti-freeway victory, either by Team or by its successors in the late 1970s and 80s.      Although Vancouver has been praised for its liveability, high house prices are forcing homeowners further out. Photograph: Getty Images    \u201cWe weren\u2019t smarter, we were later. We learned from the mistakes of Seattle and LA,\u201d says Bing Thom, a prominent Vancouver architect. He credits the city\u2019s success to, among other things, timing and sensibility.  \u201cOne of the legacies of the protests was that they created an appetite and appreciation for critical debate. We have had enlightened civil servants and an educated citizenry. Everyone has an opinion, and you can talk logic and ideas even if you disagree.\u201d  Land too valuable not to redevelop When, last year, the City of Vancouver announced that the viaducts would be demolished, it felt to Chan like a final, symbolic victory. \u201cI feel relieved,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope \u2026 to see the community reknit across the no man\u2019s land which has been there for more than 40 years.\u201d Symbolism aside, the reality is that the viaducts sit on land that is now too valuable not to redevelop. Since the late 90s, and particularly in the last few years, property values have soared. As the city has become famous for its liveability, global capital has poured in, much of it from wealthy Chinese keen to park their money in a beautiful and economically stable place.

This has precipitated an affordability crisis, with would-be homeowners moving further and further out of the city in search of housing.  \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, [the investors driving up real estate prices] are a tiny segment of the Chinese people who immigrate to the city; 99% face the same affordability issues as everyone else. It\u2019s a class issue,\u201d Thom says. He doesn\u2019t see an end to the trend anytime soon. \u201cThis is the reality of unchecked globalisation. Vancouver is a small city and the scale of change is the same as New York or London, so it affects us much more. It\u2019s inevitable that people are going to start asking themselves questions,\u201d he says. Questions like: what is Vancouver today, and who is it for?
