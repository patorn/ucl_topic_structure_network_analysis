  "body": "Having spent nearly a decade swerving the thorny subject of an Oasis re-formation, the founding member of the Britpop group has placed his price.  Noel Gallagher has said that an Oasis reunion could be a reality if the sum of \u00a320m were on the table. \u201cFor 20 million quid, one gig \u2013 that is good money isn\u2019t it?\u201d Gallagher told the Daily Star. \u201cBut I have never had that offer from anyone yet.\u201d     \u2018Liam is a very angry man still\u2019 \u2026 Noel on re-forming Oasis. Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Getty Images    Given the ostentatious and potentially unrealistic sum, it seems as if the closest fans may get to seeing the pair together again is in the forthcoming documentary about the band. Entitled Supersonic, directed by Mat Whitecross, the film was launched at Cannes film festival this week and is said to offer \u201ca rare and candid insight\u201d into the group.  \u201cI know a lot of research went into it,\u201d Noel Gallagher told the Bolton News. \u201cBut to be honest this shit was getting made while I was putting a record together, so I couldn\u2019t devote that much time to it \u2026 I did 20 hours of interviews and so there were lots of things that I\u2019d forgotten. I\u2019d forgotten how insane a lot of that time was.\u201d An Oasis reunion has long been refuted by both brothers. \u201cLiam is a very angry man still,\u201d Noel Gallagher told the Daily Star in March. \u201cSo he is not cool. I don\u2019t ever sit down and when people ask about Oasis, I go: \u2018no, that is it\u2019.\u201d In April last year the Mirror reported that Noel and Liam Gallagher had reached a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d about reuniting after the band\u2019s acrimonious split in 2009. Noel\u2019s publicist has since strongly denied there is to be a reunion.",
