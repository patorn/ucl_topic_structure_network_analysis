  "body": "Russell T Davies is a joy to interview, and a nightmare to write up. On the page his words risk losing most of their meaning, for it is in their rollocking, 100mph delivery that they come to life. Readers should therefore try to imagine hearing them in a rich, booming Welsh voice that dances from baritone to camp, heavy with Mancunian humour and ironic self-deprecation, and leavened with an irrepressible sense of the absurd. Sentences are punctuated with great convulsions of laughter, and every time all 6ft 6in of him erupts into another gale of giggles it feels as if the whole room is engulfed in his good humour. I have seldom met anyone more committed to happiness. \u201cHappy days!\u201d is one of his favourite exclamations, along with \u201cjust fantastic\u201d and \u201cwhat a hoot\u201d, and he references his own good fortune constantly, with \u201cI know how lucky I am,\u201d or \u201cHow lucky was that?\u201d When the conversation turns to something that might be considered silly or irksome, Davies reframes it with \u201cI love that\u201d. The 400th anniversary of Shakepeare\u2019s death, for example, \u201cisn\u2019t a real anniversary, is it? It\u2019s just an excuse for this entire generation like me to make their Shakespeare, because we won\u2019t be alive for the 500th anniversary of his birth in 2064. That\u2019s the real anniversary, isn\u2019t it? I love the pretence of it all.\u201d The emergence of the new star screenwriter Mike Bartlett, who wrote Doctor Foster, was \u201cin a strange way what I\u2019ve been waiting for. Someone to make me scared, and pull my socks up and see what I can write, because here comes the next generation. Ready to replace you. Which will happen anyway, whether you want it to or not. But I love that, that\u2019s how it should be. Brilliant.\u201d He\u2019s going to meet Bartlett next week, \u201cand I\u2019m just excited to meet him. Hooray.\u201d The voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cImagine if he\u2019s a misogynistic homophobic racist. Can you imagine that?\u201d He capsizes laughing. \u201cHilarious! I\u2019d have a good story to tell.\u201d     \u2018I\u2019m very proud of it. It\u2019s exactly what I always wanted to do\u2019 \u2026 Davies\u2019s version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, featuring Maxine Peake as Titania (pictured). Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Des Willie    So it takes a little while to realise that buried beneath this mountain of jollity is something that is genuinely upsetting Davies. On bank holiday Monday, BBC1 will realise the writer and director\u2019s 30-year ambition by broadcasting his version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very proud of it, I\u2019m very proud of it. It\u2019s exactly what I always wanted to do.\u201d It\u2019s a dazzling production starring Matt Lucas, John Hannah, Richard Wilson, Elaine Page and others, set in a futuristic Athenian fascist dictatorship and featuring iPads, the supernatural and sci-fi special effects all conceived to evoke Davies\u2019 Doctor Who. Children will adore it. \u201cYes!\u201d he agrees. \u201cA production like this should be for the whole audience. And that\u2019s what the BBC\u2019s there for. I think if they\u2019d said they\u2019d do it on BBC2 \u2013 well, I can\u2019t say I\u2019d have walked away, but the whole point of it was to say, \u2018This is for everyone, this is for a family audience.\u2019\u201d But news that Davies\u2019 Dream ends not with Hippolyta marrying the Duke, but kissing Titania, has provoked predictable headlines. Wouldn\u2019t he, I suggest, be mildly disappointed if the Daily Mail didn\u2019t describe his work as controversial?   Related: 'It's 2016': Russell T Davies adds lesbian kiss to A Midsummer Night's Dream    \u201cIt does piss me off.\u201d He quickly corrects himself. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t piss me off personally, I\u2019m fine. It kind of reminded me of the old days, actually. Still got it!\u201d He lets out a hoot. \u201cBut I think this genuinely raises the danger of putting people off. I would think, reading some of this publicity, it sounds like a sex version of Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. And it\u2019s not. You\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s lovely. And romantic. This is a very traditional version. So I\u2019m very, very worried that actually this is bad publicity, and it could push people away, and make them think, \u2018Oh he\u2019s sexed it up, he\u2019s queered it up. He\u2019s inverted it just for the sake of controversy.\u2019 And I haven\u2019t. Intellectually, I\u2019ve got absolutely powerful reasons for doing all those things. You don\u2019t have to agree with them, but they are there.\u201d For example, in the original script, all the women at some point refer to killing themselves. \u201cBut I refuse to transmit those lines now. In 2016 I\u2019m not having lovelorn women say they\u2019ll kill themselves. I\u2019m not putting that on BBC1; I absolutely refuse. Because I hope young girls will be watching this, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an appropriate thing to say \u2013 \u2018I love you so much, if you don\u2019t love me I\u2019ll kill myself.\u2019 I think that\u2019s untransmittable, I\u2019m not having it.\u201d         A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream trailer    As for changing the ending, \u201cYes, it\u2019s slightly different, but any changes I\u2019ve made have honestly come from the play. The literary, intellectual problem with [the ruler, Duke] Theseus is that he debunks the supernatural in a speech towards the end of the play, when there are fairies at the windows. He is literally wrong. Yet he\u2019s presented as the ruler, and wise. So he\u2019s got to fall, you\u2019ve got to get rid of him \u2013 because that bigger, sexier, joyous world of the supernatural that unites everyone and allows everyone to fall in love is at the window, it\u2019s encroaching on Athens. Let it in! That\u2019s what the ending does, it lets the magic in. And there\u2019s joy and liberation and sexual freedom in that. Wonderful!\u201d In Davies\u2019 version, Theseus dies of a heart attack and Titania, queen of the fairies, embraces his liberated bride. \u201cYou see, the point of the kiss is that the whole play is presented as a war of the sexes. And in that battle of the sexes, truly if you have to criticise the [original] play, Titania does not have a proper ending. She is fooled into falling in love with a donkey, she wakes up, the donkey is taken away and she goes, \u2018Gosh darling you fooled me,\u2019 and just submits to [fairy king] Oberon. And in 2016 I\u2019m not happy with that, genuinely not happy. \u201cThat\u2019s why we shouldn\u2019t start having headlines about a lesbian kiss \u2013 because it\u2019s better than that. The whole point of setting it in a fascist world is to break that down and open it up so that their world gets bigger, and so love gets bigger, and freedom gets bigger. So I\u2019m not having a go at the Daily Mail \u2013 well, I could, all day, but you never win that one. But I genuinely worry that people think it sounds like a sex version. And that\u2019s really unfair. But what can you do?\u201d An afterthought cheers him up. \u201cI\u2019ve just realised this happened with Doctor Who. When it was announced that I was doing Doctor Who, along comes the Sun with the headline \u2018Doctor Queer\u2019. But everyone still watched. So I expect it will be fine with Dream. Hooray!\u201d I don\u2019t know if Davies has always been this indomitably cheerful, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his optimism is as much a product of what\u2019s gone wrong in his life as what\u2019s gone right. His career began in theatre and children\u2019s TV, but in 1999 his first drama, Queer As Folk, brought him fame, and since reviving Doctor Who in 2005 he has been a global household name. By 2011 he was working in Hollywood and living on Venice beach with his long-term boyfriend, a customs officer called Andrew Smith, when catastrophe struck. Smith was diagnosed with a brain tumour. They came home to Manchester, expecting him to die.     Russell T Davies (centre) with Doctor Who stars Billie Piper and David Tennant after winning a Bafta in 2006. Photograph: Dave M Benett/Getty Images    Five years later, Smith is still alive. \u201cWe were told he had a 3% chance of survival \u2013 and there he is! Which is weird.\u201d After seven brain operations and a stroke, \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of damage. But it\u2019s fine! Cos he\u2019s alive! Hooray for the NHS.\u201d Davies is now Smith\u2019s carer, but says he finds the term slightly embarrassing. \u201cWell, I earn a lot of money and actually, weirdly, if you\u2019re going to have an illness, live with a writer who\u2019s at home all day. My life could not be more suited to having someone downstairs who needs their meals cooking for them. It\u2019s actually alright, it\u2019s what I used to do anyway, it\u2019s not that different. Seriously. It\u2019s a big deal coming to London today, but he\u2019s alright. I wouldn\u2019t stay away overnight much. Ever, really. I need to get back. But that\u2019s alright, I like going back home. In the old days I used to complain about having to stay in a stupid hotel but now I\u2019ve got an excuse, I say \u2018I\u2019ve got to go home \u2013 bye!\u2019 It\u2019s actually lovely.\u201d Davies gave up work for two years to look after Smith. \u201cBut I\u2019m very lucky, money isn\u2019t a problem, because Doctor Who kept repeating. And I had always saved. I had literally saved for a rainy day \u2013 and then it started raining. I actually could have taken 10 years off, that\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t spend much money. I might buy a nice tie, but that\u2019s it.\u201d He had loved living and working in LA. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to be ill, you want to watch Coronation Street. And Andrew\u2019s family\u2019s here, so it just felt right. We didn\u2019t even discuss it. It was just like, right, we go home now. So yes, I did love LA but it didn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t leave Britain \u2019cos I didn\u2019t like it. I love it here. And you can\u2019t stand on your high horse saying, \u2018I like living in America\u2019, can you?\u201d He starts laughing as he breaks into an anecdote about their wedding. I am confused. Nothing I had read about Davies mentioned any marriage. Now he looks confused. \u201cReally?\u201d A thorough Google search fails to unearth a single reference to it. \u201cOh. Well, I\u2019ve never Googled myself. Once you\u2019ve worked on Doctor Who you don\u2019t go online much, you see. Because they find you and descend on you \u2013 and so I keep very quiet online. And I never call Andrew my husband, because it\u2019s such a horrible term. I like saying he\u2019s my boyfriend, because it makes me sound 18.\u201d He lets out a great hoot. \u201cSo no one knows we got married! Hilarious! Isn\u2019t that funny? But we did, we really did.\u201d Smith had been proposing to him for years, and Davies always refused. But in 2012 they thought he was close to death. \u201cI only got married \u2019cos he was so ill. I mean, I had to be dragged kicking and screaming down that aisle. Kicking and screaming. It was a hilariously sad wedding, just six people, but that day we had the biggest laugh, because it was so tragic, so wonderful.\u201d   Related: Russell T Davies: 'You never stop coming out of the closet'    They wed on 1 December in the Emmeline Pankhurst suite at Manchester town hall, attended by four guests, and halfway down the aisle the music cut out. \u201cIt\u2019s programmed to do that if the volume in the room gets too loud. And the volume became too loud because our four friends were laughing so much. They were laughing at the look on my face when I had to get married at last, and Andrew, bless him, who was on steroids, he was a great big whale, and loving it, loving every second of it. It was a genuinely funny day. What a brilliant day it was in the end, it was fantastic. But oh, I was determined to hate it. And then I discovered that being married is lovely. And that\u2019s the point in the end. How lovely.\u201d If Davies is pessimistic about anything, it\u2019s the political future. The EU referendum, he laughs, should be \u201cthe easiest vote in the world. I\u2019ll vote in, of course. Mainly because everyone who\u2019s campaigning to get us out is a fucking idiot. You look at them \u2013 there\u2019s Gove, there\u2019s Boris Johnson, there\u2019s IDS. My mind is made up! Simplest vote in the world! I mean, don\u2019t bother me with statistics \u2013 it\u2019s easy.\u201d He stops laughing. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the vote though. And I\u2019m worried about Trump. Fucking hell. I\u2019ve got quite a history of being a science fiction writer, but when I look at the real world, we could be months away from Boris Johnson becoming prime minister, leading us out of Europe. Well, then we are living in a dystopian future \u2013 it\u2019s Hunger Games in the blink of an eye, isn\u2019t it? How did that happen? I mean, what is Boris Johnson except one of the rich people with their silly hair from the Hunger Games?\u201d",
