  "body": "The Greens want to use a royal commission to examine whether banks should be broken up to split the retail arms from their investment and financial advice arms in response to recent scandals. The Greens banking and finance policy also calls for increased penalties for white-collar crime, capping ATM fees and forcing banks to allow portable bank accounts which allow easy transfers, similar to taking mobile phone numbers between companies. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, a former banker, has been calling for a royal commission into the sector, which has been dogged by scandals over poor financial advice, insider trading and rigging interest rates.   Related: Timeline: banking scandals in Australia since 2009    After resisting a royal commission, Labor followed suit and has called for a royal commission into the banks following the scandals.  The Greens policy now goes a step further, outlining that a banking royal commission would \u201cfully examine the problems associated with the \u2018vertically integrated\u2019 model. \u201cThis would including looking at \u2018breaking up the banks\u2019 to separate retail banking from financial advice and investment banking,\u201d the policy statement says.  The Greens would increase penalties for white-collar crime in line with other advanced economies. For example, for criminal offences such as insider trading, Australia currently fines individuals $810,000 or three times the benefit gained, whichever is greater.  The Greens propose an increase to $5m or three times the benefit gained \u2013 a fine more in line with Canada and the United States. In the UK, the fine is not capped. Whistleblowers should be financially rewarded if their information leads to reclaimed money, according to the Greens, as is the case in the United States.  The Greens would also \u201cmake it illegal\u201d to charge excessive ATM fees and wants bank accounts to be fully portable through a common data system.  \u201cThe digital age makes \u2018identity transfer\u2019 relatively easy,\u201d says the policy. \u201cPeople can carry mobile phone numbers from one provider to another. The same option should be available to consumers in banking.\u201d The Greens would prohibit superannuation funds from direct borrowing to invest in housing, in line with a recommendation of the financial system inquiry by David Murray.  \u201cThe financial system inquiry warned that continued growth in borrowing for housing by superannuation funds could pose a risk to the financial system,\u201d the policy says.  While the Coalition rejected Murray\u2019s recommendation, it did agree to work with regulators and the tax office to monitor the risk and report back to government. The Australian Bankers\u2019 Association rejected the policy saying it would trigger an economic downturn. ABA chief executive, Steven M\u00fcnchenberg, said Australia had some of the strongest banks in the world and the major banks are part of small group which have earned the high Standard & Poor\u2019s rating of AA-. \u201cThis means that, even in times of global uncertainty and market volatility, Australia\u2019s major banks are still able to raise the money needed from overseas investors to fund the Australian economy and meet the financial needs of businesses and households,\u201d he said in a statement.  \u201cThis major economic advantage would be lost under the Greens\u2019 policy, triggering an economic downturn.\u201d",
