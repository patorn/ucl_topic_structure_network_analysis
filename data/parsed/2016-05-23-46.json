The Golden State Warriors forward has denied he kicked Adams deliberately during his team\u2019s loss Game 3 to the Thunder, and instead criticized Oklahoma City star Westbrook. \u201cYou know Russell [Westbrook] said I did it on purpose, but he\u2019s a part of the superstar group that started all this acting in the NBA,\u201d Green said on Monday. \u201cI didn\u2019t. So, I sold the call. He called me that way. I sold the call.\u201d   Related: Draymond Green's kick to the groin was a metaphor for the Warriors' shock loss    Green was given a Flagrant 1 and remained on court on Sunday night but the NBA may decide to suspend him if they see fit. On Monday, Green insisted that NBA official Scott Foster told him the contact was unintentional.  \u201cI said, \u2018Scott, how am I getting a flagrant because my leg went in the air trying to follow through on a shot?\u2019 He said, \u2018Draymond, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s intentional. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it was intentional at all. But, you caught him in the groin area, so I have to give you a flagrant,\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cI didn\u2019t argue it. It said, \u2018OK, that\u2019s understandable.\u2019\u201d  Green added that he had been kicked by Westbrook during the game. \u201cRussell Westbrook kicked me at the end of the half. He just didn\u2019t happen to catch me where I happened to caught Steve Adams at. So, no, I\u2019m not bracing for the worst.\u201d  The Warriors coach, Steve Kerr, has defended Green, saying physical contact is part of the game. \u201cStuff like that happens all the time,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThere\u2019s contact, people\u2019s arms, legs flailing. If they think it\u2019s on purpose, play the game, you know. This stuff happens all the time. Westbrook kicks out his feet on every three and there is contact. I mean, that\u2019s just part of the game. So I don\u2019t understand how that can be deemed a flagrant 1. I think it should be rescinded.\u201d  Adams himself had little doubt that the Green knew what he was doing. \u201cIt happened before, mate,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHe is pretty accurate, that guy.\u201d",
