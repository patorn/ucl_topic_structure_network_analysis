  "body": "\u2022 In a report (Minister\u2019s unqualified daughter teaches in his school, 13 May, page 11), we described Downe House as \u201can \u00a38,000-a-term independent school in Richmond, Surrey\u201d. To clarify: termly fees for day pupils are \u00a38,190 but most pupils are boarders, for whom the fees are \u00a311,320, and the school is actually in Berkshire. There is a Downe House in Richmond, which was formerly in Surrey and is now in south-west London, but that is a large residential property whose occupants have included the 18th-/19th-century playwright and politician Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and more recently the Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger and his former partner Jerry Hall. \u2022 A Shortcuts item about the musician Prince referred to his being a \u201cYouTube refusenik\u201d, meaning that he did not grant permission for videos of his work to appear on the video-sharing website, and said that after he died last month, hours of footage appeared online when \u201cthe copywriters were laying low\u201d; what the writer meant was \u201cthe copyrighters were lying low\u201d (Prince unplugged: tales from the vault, 12 May, page 2, G2). \u2022 We misspelled the surname of the estate agent Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree Estates, as Abrahamson (Register could see super-rich quit London, 13 May, page 1).",
