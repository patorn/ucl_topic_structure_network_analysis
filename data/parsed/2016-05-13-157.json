  "body": "Leaving Liverpool was not an easy decision for Fara Williams to make. The midfielder loved being part of a team with whom she had won back-to-back Women\u2019s Super League titles and off the pitch the 32-year-old had fallen in love with a city she moved to in 2004. But when Arsenal came calling Williams knew she had to switch clubs. It was a head-over-heart call but one that will feel fully justified on Saturday afternoon when she walks out at Wembley to take part in the FA Cup final. The biggest game of the season at the biggest, most famous venue in the country, with Chelsea, the holders and WSL champions, the opponents. It is this type of grand occasion that persuaded Williams to head south and her excitement at what lies ahead is tangible. \u201cWhen I was a kid, to play at Wembley in a cup final as a female was only ever a dream that was probably never going to be a reality but now for me it is a reality,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is why I came to Arsenal \u2013 to compete and win trophies, and to be in the FA Cup final in my first season at the club is a fantastic achievement, and for it to be at Wembley makes it even more exciting.\u201d Given her vast experience, Williams should arguably be taking Saturday\u2019s showpiece more in her stride. She is England\u2019s record appearance holder with 153 caps and not only played in the first women\u2019s international to be staged at the newly built national stadium two years ago but has also competed at three World Cups, including last summer\u2019s in Canada when Williams\u2019 three goals helped Mark Sampson\u2019s side secure a bronze medal.   Related: Fara Williams: \u2018I had football. A lot of homeless girls have nothing\u2019    At club level she has won the FA Cup with Everton, for whom she played before making the short journey to Liverpool in 2012. A case of been there and done that but Williams has always been ambitious and particularly so now her career is nearing the end. Given her age, it was something of a surprise that Arsenal moved for her at the turn of the year. The club may not be the dominant force of old but they remain a famous name in the women\u2019s game, not to mention one of the wealthiest and therefore capable of attracting the best, young talent. They saw something in the veteran and she saw something in them, even thought it meant leaving a place that had not just become Williams\u2019 home but her sanctuary. It was by moving to Liverpool 12 years ago, when she joined Everton, that Williams was able to escape a life of homelessness in London. The girl from Battersea thrived on Merseyside personally and professionally, helping the team clinch the WSL title in 2013 and 2014. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with the move away to be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cI try to go back as much as I can. I miss Liverpool, my house is still there and I didn\u2019t want to leave but I knew for football reasons I had to. At the time they were in transition and I\u2019m a player that needs to be at the top level. I want to go to the Euros next year and I knew Arsenal were bringing in some fantastic players who would make them even more competitive, so [switching clubs] was justified. We\u2019re in a cup final and I\u2019m training harder because I\u2019m with better players.\u201d Arsenal have impressed en route to Wembley, most notably with their 7-0 victory over Sunderland in the semi-finals, fuelling hope inside the club they can claim a trophy they won eight times between 2004 and 2014. Arsenal\u2019s WSL form has been patchy, however, with two wins from their opening five fixtures leaving Pedro Mart\u00ednez\u2019s side third. Chelsea have looked every inch the champions, winning all four of their games, as well as beating the leaders Manchester City in the semi-finals. Little wonder Emma Hayes\u2019 team are favourites to retain the trophy they won with a 1-0 victory over Notts County last season. \u201cChelsea are Double winners from last year but Arsenal are used to big games and are used to cup finals,\u201d says Williams, who is a Chelsea supporter and began her career at the club in 2000. \u201cArsenal have always won trophies and the fact of the matter is now we need to win trophies again and the FA Cup is a big one on a big stage. Hopefully we\u2019ll get the result and can push on in the league.\u201d Alongside Williams a host of England internationals will be on show, including her team-mate Casey Stoney and, from Chelsea, Karen Carney and Eniola Aluko. That perhaps explains why the Football Association expects the crowd to top the 30,710 who watched Chelsea and Notts County play in Wembley\u2019s first women\u2019s FA Cup final. For Gilly Flaherty, Chelsea\u2019s vice-captain and another England international, the rise in attendance is also proof of a general rise in the popularity of women\u2019s football in this county, something that has been helped by BT Sport showing regular live coverage of the WSL but which Flaherty believed is largely and significantly down to England\u2019s successful showing at the last World Cup. \u201cIt [the World Cup] was massive for us,\u201d says the 24-year-old, who in a reverse of Williams played for Arsenal before joining Chelsea. \u201cYou come back from it and look at the crowd attendances \u2013 we\u2019re now averaging around 1,300 a game. Before it was only Arsenal who got that sort of number. \u201cAt Chelsea we\u2019re also seeing our faces on bus stops and on the back of buses, and girls are taking pictures and tweeting us, saying: \u2018You\u2019re on the back of a bus promoting your next game\u2019. Little things like that even two years ago weren\u2019t happening.\u201d Looking to the FA Cup final, her second in nine months, Flaherty added: \u201cSince I was I was 16 and involved with the Arsenal first team, I knew the Cup final was the day when you\u2019d get a really large crowd come out and watch two women\u2019s sides play and was the one women\u2019s game that was definitely on the telly. \u201cIt\u2019s remained that way and that\u2019s why you want to be part of it. It opens up opportunities for the team and for individuals, and going forward people are going to be looking at how many cup finals you\u2019ve played in and how many you\u2019ve won.\u201d Arsenal v Chelsea in the Women\u2019s FA Cup Final kicks-off at 2pm on Saturday and is live on BBC1",
