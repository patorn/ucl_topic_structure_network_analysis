We have lower levels of woodland cover (13%) than our EU neighbours and nine out of 10 of us are firmly immured in the urban environment, yet the forest continues to thrive in the national psyche, as demonstrated by the outcry in 2011 that halted government plans to privatise England\u2019s state-owned woods and forests. This passion is partly aesthetic: who\u00a0can really resist the stark beauty of cruciform trees backlit by winter sun, the rolling green seas of birdsong they become in summer, or their spectacular russet and scarlet autumn shows? Certainly not 19th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill who, after a walk through one patch of beech trees, proclaimed woods \u201cthe great beauty of this country\u201d. We love too the off-the-lead freedom to wander these ever-changing yet timeless spaces, to briefly decentralise ourselves from the world and experience nature\u2019s otherness in counterpoint to day-to-day life. Public outrage at the proposed sell-off wasn\u2019t just about the effect it would have on a favourite view or psychological retreat, however \u2013 the very character of the country seemed under threat. In its defence, protestors evoked everyone from Robin Hood to Winnie the Pooh. Also deployed were those iconic sylvan signifiers of English history: the yew bows that won Agincourt and the hearts of oak that helped the Royal Navy rule the waves. Although slackened, our connection to woodland is deep-rooted. It is historical, cultural and personal, ingrained from millennia of habitation, dependency and usage. Even today, among a deforested population, clues as to how hard-wired and hands-on this relationship has been remain close. Take the surname Cooper, one\u00a0who crafts barrels from oak, or Cartwright or Wheelwright. In my own family (tree), there is Brayshaw \u2013 meaning a broad, small wood \u2013 Woods, Holmwood and Turner, all with associations to a place or profession tangled up with trees. Small wonder that, whenever we do find a path back, forgotten memories are stirred. We half-recall a time not too distant when woods provided all we required. And in an unstable world they still provide a sense of reassurance we\u2019re not ready to lose. Responding to this need, the past few years have seen the release of a rich and varied list of books concerned with woods. Oliver Rackham\u2019s definitive Woodlands, Richard Mabey\u2019s Beechcombings, Sara Maitland\u2019s Gossip from the Forest and Rob Penn\u2019s revival of forgotten skills, The Man Who Made Things Out of Trees. The latest in this line, The Wood for the Trees, follows renowned natural historian and broadcaster Richard Fortey as he also focuses on the tree line, albeit through a narrower aperture, using one small wood to capture a wider story of the British landscape. In 2011, after retiring from his role as senior palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum, and following a windfall from presenting a TV series, Fortey purchased four acres of prime beech and bluebell wood. Located in\u00a0the Chiltern Hills, a mile from his hometown of Henley-on-Thames, Grim\u2019s Dyke Wood\u00a0is\u00a0the very patch that had Mill so enraptured two centuries ago. Though it has changed in the intervening years, it is\u00a0still a glorious spot \u2013 Fortey\u2019s initial intention was to use the wood as a way to \u201cescape into the open air\u201d, to record a rich ecology of living wildlife following a career locked away in dusty museums studying dead things. He soon realised, however, that any portrait of the place would be incomplete without its human histories, too. \u201cI needed to explore the development of the English countryside,\u201d he writes. \u201cI was moved by a compulsion to understand half-forgotten crafts \u2026plans were made to fell timber, to follow the journey from tree to furniture \u2026 in\u00a0short, the wood became a project.\u201d What follows then is, in one sense, an expanded diary of this project over the arc of a year, except Fortey is not just any retiree keeping notes on a new\u00a0hobby. His remarkable scientific knowledge, intense curiosity and love of nature mean entries erupt with the same richness and variety as the woods they describe. From recipes for ground elder soup to musings on bumblebee varieties or gruesome tales of murder, Fortey\u2019s enthusiasm for his new wonderland is infectious and illuminating. His style echoes the great Gilbert White and his approach\u00a0is proudly old school. He makes clear his distaste for \u201cfuzzy\u201d romanticism and the intruding emotions of the observer, but he too is romantic at times, not least in his resolve to collect things found in, or\u00a0created from, his patch of wood. Mouse-gnawed cherry stones, glass made from flint, fallen birds\u2019 eggs are among the things he preserves in a cabinet made from his own timber. Of course, collections are the trade of scientists and curators too, and it\u2019s clear old habits die hard. With some help from friends at the Natural History Museum, Fortey begins a deep analysis of the wood and its inhabitants \u2013 trees, insects, animals, plants and minerals. He starts with the substrate, slicing buried flint and putting it under a microscope to identify its origins, and ends up on a cherry picker in the canopy, all in the name of cataloguing the wood\u2019s many mice, moths, bats, beetles, butterflies, crane flies, spiders, parasitic wasps, orchids, centipedes, millipedes and weird and wonderful fungi. These long taxonomies could easily be dry and exhausting, but they come alive thanks to Fortey\u2019s vivid descriptions. Flat-backed millipedes \u201clook as if they were assembled from some kind of kit that clicks together to\u00a0make miniature armoured trains\u201d; the Lithobius variegatus centipede\u2019s striped legs stick out \u201clike oars from a\u00a0Viking ship, bent on pillage\u201d. Interwoven with these records are peripatetic investigations into human stories, from this patch\u2019s iron age incarnation through Henley\u2019s boom as a thriving river town supplying timber to the capital, up to the recent snapping up and fencing off of surrounding land by oligarchs and bankers. Along the way, Fortey unearths his wood\u2019s changing fortunes and its significant ties to local estates, country houses and notable families. Taking a\u00a0broader view of British history, he reveals how its survival and ecological richness have been due to its usefulness in providing the things we need \u2013 food, fuel, coppice, charcoal, chair legs, tent\u00a0pegs and brushes. And therein lies the conundrum. The\u00a0future of British woodlands and their wildlife is precariously balanced, threatened by everything from climate change to the consumer preference for\u00a0cheap imported woods. In this deep\u00a0and interesting book, Fortey warns that without a return to hands-on management, a renewed sense of value and increased human engagement, our native woods are doomed to\u00a0become empty \u201crural decoration\u201d left \u201cto age to a kind of senility that would benefit only wood-eating beetles\u201d. Young trees need to replace the old, he writes; \u201cnew light needs to flood in\u201d. Not only do we still need the trees, but they need us, too. \u2022 Rob Cowen\u2019s Common Ground has been longlisted for the Wainwright prize.
