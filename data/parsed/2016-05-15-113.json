At the Atlantis casino and resort, men and women sit and chain-smoke at slot machines.   Related: Facebook news selection is in hands of editors not algorithms, documents show    In the attached convention centre on Saturday, the state Republican party held its convention, where grassroots activists elect delegates to the national gathering in Cleveland this summer, and agree on the state party platform. This is personal politics local activists, the party grassroots, who know Nevada will likely be an important swing state in November.  Back in Silicon Valley this week, it was reported that Facebook excludes conservative news sources from its influential feeds. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed Facebook\u2019s editorial guidelines for the people, rather than an algorithm, that select its trending stories.  In Reno, among the conservative activists, this was a cause for some anger \u2013 but in many cases, not surprise. Shelly Kyllo, a delegate from Winnemucca, Nevada, said she had heard of the story. \u201cIt makes me angry,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it violates our freedom of speech.\u201d \u201cI do use Facebook,\u201d she added. Asked if she would now change how she used the site, she said \u201cprobably not\u201d. Martha Espiritu, a delegate in a stars and stripes dress, said the stories about Facebook didn\u2019t really change much for her. \u201cIt makes me feel the same way as I feel about almost every news reporter. They\u2019re biased,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept Fox News.\u201d Shawn Whitmore, a 19-year-old who was on staff for the convention, was angrier.  \u201cFacebook obviously has no business censoring people\u2019s news,\u201d he said. \u201cThey try to play this \u2018Oh we\u2019re so neutral\u2019 thing \u2013 but we know they\u2019re censoring conservative news sites.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s almost scummy of them. I watch MSNBC, CNN, Fox News: they make no secret of their leanings. It\u2019s so dishonest of the tech companies.\u201d Facebook was \u201chypocritical\u201d, he said. Another delegate, Jon Carpenter, was angry.  \u201cIt sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause [Mark Zuckerberg]\u2019s a big liberal.\u201d  He told the Guardian both parties were being run by the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cNew World Order,\u201d his wife Sigrid chipped in. \u201cNo borders, that\u2019s what they all want,\u201d Carpenter said. The story was not on everyone\u2019s radar.  \u201cI don\u2019t look at the computer that much,\u201d said George Margolis, a retired air force colonel and determined supporter of Donald Trump. \u201cI pay attention to TV news. I don\u2019t even read the papers that much.\u201d Joe Lawrence, a delegate from Reno, described himself as \u201ca Twitter person, not a big Facebook person.\u201d He said he had always been suspicious of Facebook\u2019s motives in its use of data. \u201cThey want to sell to you,\u201d he said. His resigned lack of surprise was echoed by Karen Slentz, a delegate from Churchill County.   Related: Here is the news \u2013 but only if Facebook thinks you need to know | John Naughton    \u201cIt seems like news is not news any more,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s agenda. They promote agendas, it\u2019s not reporting news. It seems to me like it\u2019s biased.\u201d She doesn\u2019t use Facebook \u2013 she used to, she said, but she deleted her account some time ago. Jack Oswald, a 19-year-old delegate from Las Vegas, said he was hearing the story of alleged anti-conservative bias for the first time. But it didn\u2019t surprise him.  \u201cMakes sense,\u201d he said, resignedly. \u201cEveryone does it. At this point in the history of American politics, nothing surprises me.\u201d Oswald, who said he thought Trump was \u201ca prat\u201d, said he didn\u2019t get news from Facebook anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t even have an account.\u201d",
