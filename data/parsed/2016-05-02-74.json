One researcher who has questioned the effectiveness of harassment prevention classes is Lauren Edelman, a professor of law and sociology at the University of California Berkeley, the prestigious school that has been at the center of a series of high-profile faculty misconduct scandals in recent months. \u201cSexual harassment training may, in fact, make it less likely that males will recognize situations that are harassing,\u201d said Edelman, a faculty member in the renowned UC Berkeley law school, where Sujit Choudhry resigned as dean after he was found to have sexually harassed his executive assistant. \u201cSexual harassment training may provoke backlash in males.\u201d    Related: 'I was expendable': how UC Berkeley failed a woman being sexually harassed    Studies testing the effects of harassment training are very limited, but some research has suggested counterintuitive and troubling consequences \u2013 that after men complete trainings, they may be more inclined to brush aside allegations and discount victims. Some researchers believe trainings have no positive effects, tend to be more about legal cover than meaningful prevention or may even have unintended negative consequences \u2013 raising serious concerns about the way colleges and companies heavily focus on training as a solution to harassment. One Journal of Applied Behavioral Science study that evaluated a sexual harassment program for university employees found that men who participated in the training were \u201csignificantly less likely\u201d to consider coercive behaviors toward a subordinate or student as sexual harassment compared with a control group of men who hadn\u2019t done the training.  Men who completed the 30-minute training \u2013 during which officials discussed actions that constitute harassment, the harms of harassment, the importance of reporting and possible discipline \u2013 were also significantly less likely to report harassment. The men\u2019s surprising responses may have been an \u201ceffort at self-preservation intended to defend and protect against a perceived attack on them\u201d, the authors wrote. In other words, the training appears to make some men feel threatened and afraid that they will be subject to false accusations, said Shereen Bingham, co-author of the study and professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha school of communication. As a result, they may respond in a defensive manner. \u201cWe were surprised \u2026 it certainly appears to be irrational,\u201d said Bingham. \u201cThe only explanation can be psychological or emotional.\u201d The findings highlight a broader challenge \u2013 that men in leadership roles sometimes struggle to relate to the experiences of those who have faced harassment, she said: \u201cPeople in powerful positions don\u2019t have a good grasp of what it\u2019s like to be in a non-dominant group.\u201d Other studies have shown that when workplaces actively inform men of sexual harassment policies, it can also have unintended negative effects. A study published in the Social Psychology Quarterly found that after men learned about harassment rules, it triggered implicit gender biases, effectively making it more likely for them to stereotype women.   Related: Former UC Berkeley provost: sexual harassment victims deserve 'justice'    \u201cThe purpose of sexual harassment policy is to make men and women more equal in the workplace,\u201d said Justine Tinkler, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Georgia and co-author of the study. \u201cIf the policies are sort of activating gender stereotypes rather than challenging them, they may not be promoting that broader goal.\u201d Tinkler has also studied how sexual harassment trainings can provoke backlash and how people who say they support harassment laws are resistant to the enforcement of those policies. Trainings can also reinforce men\u2019s feelings that women are \u201cemotional and duplicitous in the way that they both want sexual attention, but don\u2019t want sexual harassment\u201d, she explained. Edelman, the UC Berkeley professor, said she suspects the backlash could stem from the \u201ccartoonish, somewhat unrealistic\u201d harassment examples that trainings often include \u2013 lessons that can make participants skeptical and resentful. Edelman\u2019s own research has focused on what\u2019s known as \u201csymbolic compliance\u201d, which refers to the way organizations\u2019 anti-harassment and diversity policies and procedures are primarily focused on demonstrating compliance in a legal context \u2013 and likely do little to actually reduce discrimination or harassment. What\u2019s clear is that there\u2019s minimal research suggesting that standard harassment trainings have a positive impact and an overall dearth of studies on the subject, Edelman said. \u201cWe really need more research on what works. All we really know about sexual harassment training is that it protects employers from liability. We don\u2019t know whether it protects employees. We don\u2019t know whether it reduces sexual harassment.\u201d In California, employers with 50 or more employees are required by law to provide at least two hours of harassment prevention training, and in the University of California, all faculty and supervisors must complete a training every two years. Despite those training policies, UC Berkeley administrators and professors have repeatedly harassed subordinates and students and faced light punishments after the university substantiated allegations. That includes a famous astronomer, a tenure-track professor and the law dean, who was ordered to take a training course after he was found guilty. The questionable research makes clear that universities should not only study the effectiveness of training, but should also prioritize other mechanisms to promote prevention, professors said. \u201cThe university should focus more on having a much clearer zero-tolerance policy with very clear sanctions that are very consistently carried out,\u201d said Edelman. Tinkler said the best way to combat workplace sexual harassment is to reduce gender inequality and promote women in leadership positions.  \u201cIt really requires changing workplaces that have gender inequality structured into the way that they are organized,\u201d she said.",
