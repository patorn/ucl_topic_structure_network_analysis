  "body": "Leaving the EU would be an \u201cextraordinarily irresponsible thing to do at a very dangerous moment\u201d, Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has told MPs \u2013 adding that it would be \u201cabsolutely applauded in Moscow\u201d. Fallon seized the opportunity presented by an appearance before the House of Commons defence committee, chaired by the Brexit supporter Julian Lewis, to mount an impassioned case for the UK remaining a member of the EU.    Brexit explained: intelligence sharing   \u201cA huge amount is hanging on the vote on 23 June not just for the people of this country but for the collective security of Europe and the west,\u201d he told the cross-party committee. Vladimir Putin would not have had to pay a price for annexing Crimea and destabilising eastern Ukraine without the EU, and sanctions would have been much weaker had Britain not been a member, Fallon said. Britain was \u201cin the lead\u201d in getting the EU to impose tough trade and commercial sanctions on Russia, he said, adding: \u201cThe fact we were there and able to lead the debate, the EU was able to ensure the toughest sanctions were imposed.\u201d  The UK would make sure the sanctions were renewed in July, he said.   Related: Brexit offers no residency guarantees for Britons or Europeans, PM says    Fallon suggested that if Britain left the EU, European sanctions against Russia would be relaxed, leaving UK companies, still facing tougher controls in dealing with Russia, at an unfair disadvantage. Lewis did not interrupt the defence secretary\u2019s impassioned plea for Britain to remain in the EU, but said his committee was as evenly divided \u201cas the rest of the nation\u201d on the question. Fallon\u2019s intervention in the EU debate came during two hours of testimony on the implications for UK defence and security of a resurgent Russia, in particular perceived threats to Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, Baltic states that are Nato members. Questioned about the credibility of Nato\u2019s article 5, whereby an armed attack on any member of the alliance would be considered an attack on all, Fallon replied: \u201cIt is important for Nato not to define article 5 too clearly.\u201d To do so, he said, would make it easier for Russia to know how far it could go, before reaching Nato\u2019s threshold. Lewis questioned whether Nato could continue admitting new members \u201cstretching its umbrella without at some point the article 5 guarantee losing credibility\u201d. He asked whether there were limits on the number of countries that could join Nato, to which Fallon replied: \u201cAs a matter of principle, I think there should not be a limit.\u201d     Julian Lewis. Photograph: Parliament TV    Anxieties over Russia will be the elephant in the room at a Nato summit in Warsaw, Poland, in early July. In response to Baltic and Polish concerns about Putin\u2019s Russia, Nato leaders are discussing plans for \u201can enhanced forward presence\u201d in what is called the alliance\u2019s eastern flank. Whether permanent Nato bases are permitted under the Founding Act signed by Nato and Russia in 1997, is disputed. The summit may reach agreement on a formula whereby the bases would be permanent but different military units from different countries would rotate, deployed there at different times.",
