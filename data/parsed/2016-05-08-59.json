  "body": "And so to the final day. Barcelona have not yet won the league title and they may still be denied next Saturday but they took one step closer after they defeated Espanyol 5-0 at the Camp Nou while Real Madrid, a point behind, beat Valencia 3-2 at home but Atl\u00e9tico Madrid lost 2-1 at Levante, 350km south on the east coast, ruling them out of contention. A victory for Barcelona at Granada, whose 4-1 victory at Sevilla means they are now safe, would make Barcelona champions for the sixth time in eight years and they will also take the title if they can match Real Madrid\u2019s result at Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a. Two goals from Luis Su\u00e1rez and one each for Lionel Messi, Neymar and Rafinha took them to within touching distance of a league that most thought they had tied up a month ago. Instead a single point from 12 turned this into a five-match, three-team sprint for the title. Real, Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico won three in a row but Atl\u00e9tico fell at the penultimate hurdle with Sunday\u2019s defeat at the bottom club, who have been relegated. Real\u2019s pursuit continues, though, and Barcelona must hold them off for one more week. At least they do not do so against a team fighting for its life. All games kicked off at 5pm and Diego Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico climbed ahead of them, as it stood, after two minutes when Fernando Torres scored at Levante. But Barcelona went back to the top five minutes later, when Messi lifted a free-kick over the wall and beyond Pau L\u00f3pez. Not until the second half could Barcelona really feel comfortable. Word came through that Real Madrid had taken the lead against Valencia but there was better news for Bar\u00e7a when Atl\u00e9tico conceded an equaliser and Granada were clearly rolling over Sevilla. As long as the lead was a single goal there would still be concerns for the Catalans. No one had forgotten 2007 when, on the penultimate game of the season, Espanyol got an 89th-minute equaliser here to cost their city rivals the title. But this time the margin was not a single goal for long.

Both came from Su\u00e1rez, his 36th and 37th league goals of the season, slotting past L\u00f3pez at his near post and then heading in Neymar\u2019s corner. L\u00f3pez then made a dreadful mistake to allow Rafinha to score and Su\u00e1rez laid on a cross for Neymar to make it five. A moment later Levante scored a late winner against Atl\u00e9tico. Though the title slipped from Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s reach, it was not yet beyond Real\u2019s and Valencia were unable to get the equaliser that would have made Barcelona champions on Sunday night. There are still two teams in it with a week to go.   Related: Antoine Griezmann fires Atl\u00e9tico Madrid into final at Bayern\u2019s expense",
