With the sun shining and the pool water twinkling, Big Bear struts his stuff and loses himself to the music. The great JT was one of the interval entertainers at this year\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest but by far the funniest act involved hosts M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w and Petra Mede performing a song that they said included all the ingredients for a perfect Eurovision song. Check out Love Love Peace Peace with its milkmaid, violinist, grannies and ice skaters \u2013 it\u2019s a winner! James Corden had a little help getting to work this week from singer-songwriters Demi Lovato and Nick Jonas from the Jonas Brothers, who stopped to make a few dollars on the sidewalk. The laughs continue with Chili the cat who performs in a parody of Cut Video\u2019s 100 Years of Beauty series by sporting some of the most famous feline looks from the past 100 years. There is a furry encounter of a slightly more dangerous nature when Breaking Trail presenter Coyote Peterson encounters an ocelot in the wild. Cameramen were on hand to capture all the action \u2013 unlike in our classic demolition footage which is bust by a bus. Canadian artist Drake has told fans on Saturday Night Live that he is upset that everything he does is turned into a meme and sings about it to hilarious effect and UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt finds himself in The Thick of It when he is quizzed by Channel 4\u2019s Jon Snow over his handling of the NHS junior doctors\u2019 contracts. Finally Star Trek fans are gearing up for a new TV show and we have a first look teaser as the Starship Enterprise once more boldy goes where no man has gone before \u2026 Enjoy!
