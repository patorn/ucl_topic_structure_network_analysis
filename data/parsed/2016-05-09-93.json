  "body": "A Mexican federal judge has ruled that Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n can be extradited to face trial in the US, days after he was moved to a prison on the border with Texas. Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry now has 20 days to approve the extradition, a political decision which Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers described as a foregone conclusion.  \u201cWe\u2019re convinced the [foreign ministry] will concede this request for extradition,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Refugio Rodr\u00edguez, one of the lawyers representing Guzm\u00e1n, told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s been government policy. For a number of years now, the government has granted all of the United States\u2019 extradition requests,\u201d he said. On Saturday, the Mexican government shipped Guzm\u00e1n to a penitentiary in the border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, saying it regularly rotated federal inmates around the country and was initiating work to \u201creinforce security\u201d at the Altiplano prison near Mexico City, where he was being held. Guzm\u00e1n, one of the most senior members of the Sinaloa cartel, was Mexico\u2019s most wanted kingpin until his capture by Mexican marines in February 2014.   Related: Blood, mud and lube: how El Chapo's luck came up short in small town sex motel    His escape from Altiplano last July \u2013 through a mile-long tunnel which opened into his cell-room shower \u2013 humiliated the government of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and highlighted the deep corruption in the country\u2019s prison system. But details of the investigation into the escape will stay out of the public domain until 2028, following a ruling by the attorney general\u2019s office, the online news organization Sin Embargo reported on Monday. Guzm\u00e1n was recaptured in January in his home state of Sinaloa, and returned to Altiplano. This time, however, he was kept under much stricter conditions, and, according to his family, unable to sleep as guards would awake him constantly. Mexico had previously been unwilling to extradite Guzm\u00e1n, but after his recapture  the president said that he would ensure that Guzm\u00e1n would face justice in the US as soon as possible. He faces at least seven criminal indictments in several US states, on charges including conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, money laundering and drug distribution. According to reports in local media, US officials requested Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s extradition to face charges at the district court southern district of California in San Diego for importing and possession of cocaine with the intention of trafficking.  The charges date back to 1996, and allege Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel imported cocaine in tins of chilies and other packaged food products and smuggled some of the merchandise through tunnels crossing into California. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s legal team promises to seek an injunction against extradition. Refugio was uncertain when Guzm\u00e1n might be extradited, but the said the appeal process could take \u201cyears\u201d. The sudden transfer to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez this weekend appears to have caught Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s legal team by surprise: Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers say that they were only informed after \u201cEl Chapo\u201d had exited Altiplano and have complained that the move was made without a judge\u2019s approval.  The conditions of the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez prison also caused questions. The annual prison report from the National Human Rights Commission ranked Cefereso No 9 in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez worst among Mexico\u2019s federal penitentiaries, though it scored highly in the area of \u201cconditions of governability\u201d.",
