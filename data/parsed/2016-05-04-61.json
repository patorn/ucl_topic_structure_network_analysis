There is no link between the two incidents. But the pointed reference to Deepwater Horizon in the 155bn real (\u00a330bn) claim tells BHP and its local partner they now face a proper legal fight in which all tactics are deemed fair. The prosecutors\u2019 aim is clearly to extract the maximum sum by whatever means. Indeed, there seems to be a secondary ambition of heaping embarrassment on the Brazilian government, which the independent prosecutors accuse of selling out in striking a settlement in March that observers estimated to be worth between 12bn and 20bn real. BHP\u2019s shareholders seemed surprised by this turn of legal events \u2013 the share price fell 6% \u2013 but they should not have been. Brazilian politics is in crisis and the country\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, is fighting for her survival. A dam disaster in which 19 people died, 700 people lost their homes and a tide of mud and residue ran 300 miles downstream to the mouth of the river Doce was always likely to acquire a deep political dimension. In that regard, a comparison can be made with Deepwater Horizon, where BP\u2019s Britishness was hauled centre stage. The other similarity is that the case is bound to drag on for years, introducing fresh political risk for BHP and Vale if Rousseff falls. The eventual outcome probably won\u2019t be the eye-catching \u00a330bn demanded in the latest lawsuit. Equally, though, the $5bn (\u00a33.4bn) or so in the government-sponsored settlement should now be seen as wishful thinking. Next\u2019s finger-in-the-air exercise proves mildly reassuring Here is Next\u2019s considered opinion on the current state of consumer demand, derived from an analysis of its own trading in the past six weeks: \u201cDunno, guv, we only sell clothes and stuff.\u201d The firm\u2019s chief executive, Lord Wolfson, didn\u2019t put it like that, of course. Instead there was a worthy discourse on the effect of weather on recent weak sales - cold in March and April versus last year\u2019s hot Easter - followed by a confession that the real problem may just be that consumers are spending less. Amid the uncertainty, Next reckons its sales this year could fall by 3.5%, but might rise by the same percentage. Put another way, pre-tax profits could decrease 8.9% to \u00a3748m or could improve 3.7% to \u00a3852m. It might seem odd that the market regarded this finger-in-the-air exercise as mildly reassuring - Next\u2019s shares rose 3.5% - Ibut in a sense it is. Widening the range of possible profit outcomes to \u00a3104m - from \u00a374m only two months ago - is unusual, but the key conclusion is surely that Next doesn\u2019t expect to come apart at the seams, whatever happens. The low-end profit figure of \u00a3748m is hardly a disaster, even if it is correct that consumer confidence has turned down. In the long term, Next faces the problem of combating competitors who seem to have learned and copied its best distribution and logistics tricks. An upgrade is required for the online and catalogue Directory business, as Next admits. The short-term headaches, though, seem more irritating than painful. More reasons to be cheerful at Sainsbury\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s relentless cheerfulness stands in contrast to Next\u2019s default caution. The trouble is, the terrain looks fundamentally trickier for the supermarket chain. Yes, Sainsbury\u2019s deserves plaudits for hanging onto its 16.5% share of the grocery market as its main rivals have stumbled. Yes, its chief executive, Mike Coupe, is on track to deliver every last penny of his three-year \u00a3500m cost-saving programme. And, if we\u2019re being scrupulously fair, he may also be correct that the punters are crying to taste the \u201cmulti-product, multichannel shopping experience\u201d that the purchase of Argos is intended to conjure. In the end, two financial statistics stand out from the full-year figures. First, underlying profits of \u00a3587m, down 14% on the year, were the lowest since 2009. Second, operating profit margins fell from 3% to 2.7%, meaning Sainsbury\u2019s travelled away from its medium-term ambition of 3% to 3.5%. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Coupe and co\u2019s strategy \u2013 keep plugging away in food and experiment elsewhere \u2013 but the warning that \u201cthe market is competitive, and it will remain so for the foreseeable future\u201d should be taken literally. Amazon is poised to try its luck in fresh food, which may be the trigger for Walmart to order its underlings at Asda to wake up. LSE and Deutsche love-in holds firm It\u2019s the perennial bleat of the disappointed would-be bidder \u2013 we didn\u2019t get enough \u201cengagement\u201d from the other side. The latest disaffected party is Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, which had dreamed of pouncing on the London Stock Exchange and thus busting the European love-in with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Let\u2019s not waste time on overtures supposedly rebuffed. The rules of the takeover game are straightforward. If you wave a decent offer, your target is usually obliged to give you a hearing. Just don\u2019t expect a red carpet. In the case of LSE/Deutsche, it was obvious from day one that the partners would be separated only by force.",
