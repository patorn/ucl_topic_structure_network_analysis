  "body": "The blanket ban on the trade in legal highs, which comes into force on Thursday, is expected to lead to the products disappearing from high street \u201chead shops\u201d and UK-based websites virtually overnight, police and trading standards officers have said. But there are fears that the trade in new psychoactive substances (NPS) \u2013 as they are officially known \u2013 will move underground to illegal street markets and the dark web, the network of untraceable and hidden websites. The blanket ban on legal highs criminalises the production, distribution, sale and supply of psychoactive substances, backed by prison sentences of up to seven years. Simon Bray, the National Police Chiefs Council\u2019s lead on legal highs, said at the weekend: \u201cHead shops are not always exclusively NPS, of course. Some are going to be selling other stuff so some may continue trading. But those which have built their business around psychoactive substances will reduce in number or cease to be.\u201d The ban comes as four people have been taken to hospital after taking legal highs in Greater Manchester. The men, in their 30s and 40s, were found in various states of consciousness around Rochdale on Tuesday afternoon. It follows a series of incidents in the town over the weekend in which five men fell ill after taking legal highs.  The legislation is expected to have a deterrent effect on \u201chead shops\u201d and other legitimate traders who will simply stop selling legal highs rather than risk prosecution. Possession by individuals will not be a criminal offence. The ban in England and Wales is targeted at outlawing the trade in synthetic chemicals designed to imitate the effects of traditional illicit drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy. The last official crime survey figures estimated that more than 937,000 people in England and Wales had used a legal high at some time, 279,000 of them in the last year. Nitrous oxide (also known as laughing gas), salvia, and other substances that affect a \u201cperson\u2019s mental functioning or emotional state by stimulating or depressing their nervous system\u201d are also covered by the ban.  The term psychoactive covers such a wide range of substances that the legislation comes with an extensive list of exemptions including food, medicines, alcohol, nicotine and tobacco products, and coffee and tea. New Home Office guidance to shops and other retailers appears to recognise that drawing a line between some household goods and banned substances is not always going to be easy.  It suggests that someone over 25 who tries to buy several whipped cream canisters, which contain nitrous oxide, and nothing else at 11pm should be asked why they are buying them: \u201cThe customer hesitates in replying and when they do they seem intoxicated, slurring their words. In this scenario the cashier should consider not selling the goods,\u201d the Home Office advises. A Home Office expert evaluation of a similar ban in Ireland, which came into effect in 2010, reported that a network of 102 \u201chead shops\u201d virtually disappeared without the need for prosecutions as a result of the ban.  A Eurobarometer survey suggesting that use of legal highs actually rose in the wake the ban in Ireland was blamed on a small sample size. Numbers attending drug treatment services as problem users of legal highs have declined since the ban. The Home Office study however also warned there was a \u201ckey risk\u201d that the sale of more popular banned substances would move \u201cinto criminal supply either through internet, international retailers or organised crime and street dealers as happened in the UK with the residual market in mephedrone. \u201cIn addition, any responsible retail practices eg minimum purchase age restrictions employed by head shops will be lost.\u201d The study also warned that it was likely that some people would move from legal highs to alcohol, traditional illicit drugs and prescription medicines. The Local Government Association said councils had long called for the blanket ban: \u201cWe are aware of the risk that the sale of psychoactive substances will now move on to the \u2018dark web\u2019 \u2013 a network of untraceable online activity and hidden websites \u2013 and would welcome the government putting additional resources into tackling the online threat,\u201d said Simon Blackburn of the LGA. Steve Hynes of the North West ambulance service also welcomed the legislation: \u201cWe have seen a marked increase in the number of calls received from people who have reacted badly to taking these drugs and their symptoms can range from dizziness and nausea to confusion, cardiac problems and even death.  \u201cBecause there are so many different substances on the market, it is difficult for us to know how to treat someone as we don\u2019t know what chemicals they have ingested. This can delay treatment and have long-term consequences for the individual. We hope the introduction of this legislation will send out a clear message that when taking these \u2018legal highs\u2019 you are risking your safety and even your life,\u201d he said. But a spokesperson for the drugs thinktank Transform said: \u201cThis act will end head shop sales, so politicians will have their visible PR success, but the markets will simply shift to unregulated street and online sales, increasing health risks and crime. Similar bans haven\u2019t worked in Ireland, where use has risen to the highest in Europe, or in Poland, where poisonings from these drugs have increased.\u201d The Home Office minister Karen Bradley defended the new law, saying: \u201cToo many lives have been lost or ruined by the dangerous drugs formerly referred to as \u2018legal highs\u2019. That is why we have taken action to stamp out this brazen trade. \u201cThe Psychoactive Substances Act sends a clear message \u2013 these drugs are not legal, they are not safe and we will not allow them to be sold in this country.\u201d",
