  "body": "The billionaire stockbroker bankrolling the Brexit campaign has touted the insecurity that would result as \u201cfantastic\u201d and likened the consequences of leaving the EU to the Dunkirk retreat of the second world war.   Related: Brexit campaigners dominating referendum fundraising battle    \u201cIt would be the biggest stimulus to get our butts in gear that we have ever had,\u201d Peter Hargreaves said. \u201cIt will be like Dunkirk again,\u201d he added, comparing Brexit to the British military\u2019s forced evacuation from Europe after France fell to the Nazis.  \u201cWe will get out there and we will be become incredibly successful because we will be insecure again. And insecurity is fantastic.\u201d  The message starkly contradicts some of the most prominent Brexit campaigners who have denied that insecurity would result. Boris Johnson \u2013 the former London mayor \u2013 has ridiculed the prime minister, David Cameron, for suggesting that leaving the EU would pose a risk to peace in Europe.  Unlike Hargreaves, some of the biggest institutions in London\u2019s financial services industry have come out strongly in favour of staying in the EU amid forecasts of economic damage from leaving. Several big global banks have donated to the anti-Brexit campaign, arguing that insecurity is bad for business. Will Straw, the executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, condemned Hargreaves for touting insecurity as a positive. \u201cThese out-of-touch remarks from the Leave campaign\u2019s biggest donor show they simply do not care about the damaging consequences for people\u2019s jobs, family finances and Britain\u2019s economy. \u201cFar from being fantastic, leaving would hit family finances by \u00a34,300 a year and is not a risk worth taking,\u201d Straw said.   Related: Two-thirds of banks fear Brexit, according to UK industry poll     Hargreaves, 69, co-founder of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, is one of Britain\u2019s richest men. When donors to both sides in the EU referendum campaign were announced on Wednesday he emerged as by far the biggest on either side, having given \u00a33.2m to the Leave camp. \u201cAll the people in the City of London who I rate and are intelligent and talk sense actually say it would better if we left,\u201d Hargreaves said. \u201cAll the government lackeys, all the bureaucrats and the people on the boards [who] haven\u2019t got a clue what they are talking about want us to remain.\u201d He compared the future of Britain outside the EU to that of Singapore, which became independent from Malaysia in 1965.  \u201cIt was a mosquito-infested swamp with no natural resources,\u201d he said. \u201cAll they had were people with brains and hands and they turned into it the greatest economy in the world. I believe that will happen to us, too.\u201d With Reuters",
