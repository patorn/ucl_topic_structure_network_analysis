  "body": "Five Melbourne men who allegedly wanted to use a small fishing boat to reach Indonesia and join Islamic State in Syria have been charged with terrorism-related offences. The men were arrested near Cairns on Tuesday towing a seven-metre vessel , en route to Cape York in far North Queensland.   Related: Suspects in alleged dinghy plot will be held for another 72 hours    They were charged after four days in custody with one count each of making preparations for incursions into foreign countries to engage in hostile activities and could face life in prison if convicted. They include Islamic preacher and the alleged Isis sympathiser Musa Cerantonio, whose lawyers told Guardian Australia that all five men would plead not guilty. The five, aged between 21 and 31, are due to appear in Cairns magistrates court on Monday. They also include Shayden Thorne and Kadir Kaya, who allegedly told Melbourne radio after his passport was revoked in October that Australia was \u201can open-air prison\u201d. The attorney general, George Brandis, said on Sunday that despite the \u201cunusual character to the [alleged] plot\u201d the government did not \u201ctake this lightly\u201d. \u201cI know ... elements of the media have ridiculed it, but of course it\u2019s not to be taken lightly,\u201d he told a media conference in Brisbane. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime carrying a penalty of life imprisonment after all [if convicted].\u201d Brandis said the men had been \u201cunder surveillance for quite some time\u201d and had their passports cancelled months ago. He said the charging of the men on Saturday night, after they were held in custody without charge for four days, was a result of both \u201cevidence police had obtained prior to the men being arrested, as well as what was learned during the course of those investigations subsequent to arrest\u201d. \u201cThe police formed a view there was sufficient basis to charge the men, and that\u2019s why they were charged last night,\u201d he said. The men are expected to be extradited to Victoria, where they are alleged to have bought the boat and made the bulk of other preparations to leave the country. Brandis said such extraditions were usually swift. The Australian federal police assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan said they had been under investigation for a \u201cnumber of weeks\u201d.
