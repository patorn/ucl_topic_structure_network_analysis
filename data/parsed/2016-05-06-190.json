  "body": "PICK OF THE WEEK Alex Cameron She\u2019s Mine            Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of Sydney\u2019s Alex Cameron, a warped cabaret turn with a cheap keyboard in the vein of Alan Vega and Ariel Pink. He may look like a photofit of the guy who tried to break into your dad\u2019s Vauxhall Senator in 1981 while high on Araldite, but She\u2019s Mine is as meticulously crafted as any Beyonc\u00e9 belter. It\u2019s even got two choruses, of which the second \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s just water/ Taste it/ I promise\u201d \u2013 is the creepiest you\u2019ll hear this week. Unless Robin Thicke has a record out. Sonny Green Bars             Southend MC Sonny Green \u2013 no relation to Professor, or Sir Philip \u2013 eschews the screwface to deliver grime with a grin. Not just a cheeky little smirk either but a big, toothy, shit-eating grin, somewhere between Rob Beckett and the Mad magazine mascot. Bars won\u2019t win any prizes for originality, but as a track that celebrates the simple pleasure of saying stuff that rhymes over a hyped-up PlayStation beat, it\u2019ll make you beam like Green himself. Nite Jewel Kiss The Screen       In all those gushing profiles of electro pioneer Giorgio Moroder last year, everyone was too kind to mention that his comeback record, featuring Kylie and Charli XCX, was an absolute shocker. This is what it should have sounded like: a slightly awkward but affectionate clinch of austere European synths and sickly American pop sugar, singing about falling in love with a Tinder profile. And given some of the Tinder dates my friends have been on, Nite Jewel\u2019s shimmering \u201chandheld fantasy\u201d is surely preferable to meeting any of those pouting chancers IRL. Loyle Carner Stars & Shards            There\u2019s no doubting Loyle Carner\u2019s verbal dexterity as he calmly lays down a wry, intricate narrative about the downfall of an old acquaintance that pleasingly rhymes \u201closing the plot\u201d with \u201citching his scrot\u201d. But the acoustic jazz-hop beat is a bit\u2026 too nice. I suspect the industry loves this kind of Jools-friendly rap more than the public. Two words: Speech Debelle. Terry Don\u2019t Say Sorry       Terry is in the running for worst band name ever, until you discover that one them is also in a group called Dick Diver. But one thing we instantly learn about Terry is that they\u2019re proudly unapologetic. In fact, refusing to apologise is the very topic of this insolently basic Sham 69 chug. There\u2019s no tune and, frankly, it\u2019s about two minutes too long, but you imagine they won\u2019t say sorry for that, either.",
