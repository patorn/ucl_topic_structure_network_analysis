Hell, he doesn\u2019t even show up for the first couple of minutes. Instead, the show opens with a record-scratch, a dustily projected image of a few planets emblazoned with the words \u201cOUTER SPACE\u201d, and a screaming cosmic being whose flight is accompanied by a horn section of air raid sirens.     \u2018I always preach from an upside down Bible!\u2019 Irungu Mutu as the African preacher Photograph: Lewis Jacobs/Sony Pictures Telev/AMC    Hanging a left at Saturn, our space oddity flies to a church in Africa (the globe helpfully says \u201cAFRICA\u201d), where it briefly inhabits the body of a preacher who is conveniently talking about the Book of Revelation. After knocking him over and stunning his congregation into silence, the preacher stands up and addresses the crowd with a booming, Paul Robeson-esque baritone. At the very moment the preacher takes on a mantle as a prophet \u2026 he explodes. Oops. From this, we can surmise two things about Preacher: this show will be extremely goofy, and there will be a lot of collateral damage.   Related: Preacher: 'It's bigger than Breaking Bad. It's a romp'    \u2018The time of the Preacher\u2019     Cassidy \u2013 Irish drug addict/pyrotechnics enthusiast/vampire \u2013 and Tulip O\u2019Hare, the show\u2019s biggest immediate draw. Photograph: Lewis Jacobs/Sony Pictures Telev/AMC    For people who aren\u2019t fans of the comic the show is based on (which I\u2019ll try to reference only when necessary), Rogen and Goldberg do a fantastic job introducing Jesse as he wakes from a nightmare. His back is covered in scars and tattoos, his desolate room is littered with empty bottles of whiskey, his hair is perfectly tousled even though he barely takes care of himself. He\u2019s an archetypal hard-drinking southerner. But he\u2019s also a terrible preacher, flatlining in front of his congregation and putting in a half-hearted effort, at best, to connect with anyone.   Related: Guitar girls: TV's musical narrative trope is too blunt and too convenient    The introductions continue with the show\u2019s lovable, godless rogue, who turns out to be a far better preacher than Jesse. As Irish drug addict/pyrotechnics enthusiast/vampire Cassidy, Joseph Gilgun\u2019s cadence is musical, seductive, and practically incomprehensible. It doesn\u2019t matter that all he has to do is talk. And talk he does, pretending to be the attendant on an extremely expensive-looking, coke-and-weed-fueled private flight, before he realizes that his fellow passengers are vampire hunters carrying marked-up Bibles that look like leftover props from The Number 23. (On top of all that, two mysterious men who have been tracking the entity\u2019s path of destruction finally arrive in Annville, their intentions unknown.) To escape, Cassidy jumps out of the plane, eventually landing in a field \u2013 we find out some logistics of his vampire life \u2013 he can repair wounds but needs blood to do so, on this occasion he eats a cow. Before that, he breaks a champagne bottle open in a guy\u2019s chest and uses it as a blood tap. This manic spirit imbues all of the fights, from Cassidy hitting things off a table with a golf club at his assailants to kicking a chair at someone in the middle of a bar fight. It seems like everyone is having fun with the fights, ridiculousness and all, rather than joylessly trading punches like they\u2019re healthy lunch snacks. But the best fighter of all might be Tulip, Jesse\u2019s ex-girlfriend and the show\u2019s biggest immediate draw. Ruth Negga is a soulful whirlwind of menace, staking out Jesse\u2019s house, biting a guy\u2019s ear off, giving important life lessons about feminism to some random children, building a bazooka. You know, the usual. \u2018Open your heart\u2019     Blast from the past: Ruth Negga as Tulip O\u2019Hare, the ex-girlfriend of Jesse Custer, played by Dominic Cooper. Photograph: Lewis Jacobs/Sony Pictures Telev/AMC    Jesse is trying to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps, as characters on prestige television shows must. It\u2019s true that the flashbacks to Jesse\u2019s father being murdered in front of him serve a narrative function (we don\u2019t see who\u2019s pulling the trigger, but if the comics are any indication Jesse\u2019s family situation is about to get a lot more complicated). But they\u2019re also so boring and portentous that I\u2019m having trouble writing this sentence, and by far the worst part of the pilot. Self-seriousness is not a good look on this show. The series\u2019 version of Annville is, at least in part, the nuts and bolts version of what you would expect from a small town in Texas (this isn\u2019t Friday Night Lights, my dudes), but Rogen and Goldberg do a decent job fleshing it out all the same. Among the many locals the pilot gives us are the surly, morally panicked sheriff, his son, the extremely chill and fun and relentlessly positive Arseface \u2013 sorry, Eugene \u2013 and Donnie, the local thug who might be beating his wife, but also might be in a marriage with some weird kinks. Donnie\u2019s son, unaware of the intricacies of consent and the thin boundary between pain and pleasure, asks Jesse to beat up his dad. This kicks off what will probably be a big part of the series\u2019 ongoing plot: Jesse breaks Donnie\u2019s arm, giving in to his violent instincts from a past life with Tulip (who has tried to get him to go back out on \u201cjobs\u201d that almost certainly involve guns), and getting himself sent to jail with Cassidy in the process. Then we get to the curious case of Ted Reyerson, a congregant who keeps talking about his overbearing mother as if straight from the pages of a Woody Allen script. It would be easy to assume he\u2019s just supposed to comic relief. Instead, Jesse accidentally uses the power of the space entity \u2013 real name Genesis \u2013 (which, by the way, has entered his person in the middle of the night during a crisis of faith-type-situation) to tell him to open his heart to his mother. Ted does so, literally cutting his body open and depositing his heart in the middle of a confession. It\u2019s grim, sick, and above all, amusing as hell. Praise the Lord. Notes from the nave     It doesn\u2019t matter that all he has to do is talk. Photograph: Lewis Jacobs/Sony Pictures Telev/AMC    It helps that the script was written by the series\u2019 secret weapon, Sam Catlin. Catlin, for non-TV nerds, is a veteran of another AMC show that combined western instincts with dark comedy: Breaking Bad.   \u201cI just Abe Lincoln-ed that squirrel!\u201d Great introduction to Donnie The airline Cassidy is on is called Babylonian, because of course it is. Rogen and Goldberg pack frames full of visual gags that function the way isolated panels do in comics, like the wording on the church sign.  Obligatory Johnny Cash song            Scripture of the week The African preacher quotes Revelation 19:11-13 just before things go pop:  11 \u201cAnd I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. 12 \u201cHis eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.\u201d 13 \u201cAnd he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.\u201d   Johnny Cash was keen on the first section (it\u2019s quoted at the start of The Man Comes Around), while the rest acts as a precursor to the episode\u2019s bloody action. Most ridiculous death It\u2019s a tie between Cassidy\u2019s makeshift blood tap and Tulip\u2019s bazooka, if only because we (smartly) don\u2019t actually see Tulip use the weapon. Also, the blood tap is a genuinely original vampire kill idea, which I thought was a myth like Bigfoot or successful sitcoms starring a post-Friends Matthew Perry. Honorable mention for Tulip\u2019s use of an ear of corn as a spear. Cassidy kill count Five humans and one cow.",
