  "body": "Jamie Delgado is so deeply sewn into the fabric of British tennis he can remember playing a teenaged Andy Murray in Scotland. Now, at 39, he would gladly take on the full-time job of guiding the rest of the Scot\u2019s sometimes turbulent, never dull career \u2013 if he were asked to do so. \u201cI have always had a good relationship with him,\u201d Delgado said during a rain-break at Roland Garros on Saturday afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t remember [exactly] when I first saw him. He was 15 or 16 years old. I really liked the way he played then and I always looked out for his results since then.\u201d Murray still kids him about their only competitive match, though. \u201cYeah, I lost,\u201d Delgado says. \u201cHe\u2019s always going on about that. I told him it was the worst result of my playing career. It was a Futures in Scotland.\u201d Murray famously paved the way in coaching philosophy by first employing a former great in Ivan Lendl and then a former women\u2019s No 1 in Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo. Would Delgado like to fill those shoes? \u201cIf he asked me to do it, I would be more than willing \u2013 of course I would. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve talked that much to him about. It\u2019s his decision at the end of the day. But, yes, if he was to say: \u2018Jamie do you want to do it full on?\u2019 yes of course I would.   Related: Andy Murray cruises past Ivo Karlovic into French Open fourth round    \u201cAm\u00e9lie obviously did it for however long it was and I just joined as a trial at the end of Australia. The only time I saw her was in Miami. The only work I\u2019ve done with him really has been on my own since Australia. It\u2019s just been one week when she was around and I was around. I got on really well with Am\u00e9lie and it was great. But, in terms of my professional job, it\u2019s not really been any different.\u201d What did he make of Murray\u2019s recent statements that he would take Lendl back if the terms were mutually agreeable? \u201cIf he believes that there is someone who can help him, then I will support him. If he thinks he really needs it, if someone came in, I would work with that person. Even if someone came in, I would probably be doing most of the job anyway.\u201d Their immediate task is to negotiate the 6ft 10in challenge of John Isner in the fourth round here on Sunday, and it is a considerable one, as the American has been hitting the ball with serious intent all week. He overtook Ivo Karlovic at the top of the tournament aces board on 92 after sticking 34 past the Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili on Friday and, although he has reached only one major quarter-final, he is talking up his chances. Delgado, an astute doubles player in his day and renowned as a solid strategist, had feared Murray might struggle against Radek Stepanek in the first round, as he did, and he is wary of Isner too. He predicted there was even better tennis to come from Murray at 29. \u201cYes, there are improvements [to be made] in his game, for sure. We are trying to work on those. \u201cI don\u2019t see him as a player who has got everything and there\u2019s nothing to do. There are things in his game that could be better and he\u2019s trying to be the best as well \u2013 trying to beat [Novak] Djokovic more often is one thing obviously.\u201d Delgado, born in Birmingham, brought up in Tenerife and the UK, was a schoolfriend of Tim Henman but never shared the limelight with the four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. He turned professional at 18 and retired at 37 after playing in his 23rd consecutive Wimbledon tournament, junior and senior. It is as if he has always been there, not a star but a reliable and steady presence. If Murray were to abandon thoughts of reuniting with Lendl, Delgado might be perfectly placed to replace Mauresmo \u2013 especially if the world No2 were to go all the way here. Isner thinks Murray got \u201cjust what the doctor ordered\u201d in his match against Karlovic after two draining five\u2011setters. \u201cHe\u2019s so unbelievably fit, and then he didn\u2019t have such a physical match [on Friday]. Playing Ivo, the points were a lot shorter and it went three sets. He\u2019s going to be 100% on Sunday. I anticipate myself being 100%, as well. I would imagine he\u2019s definitely feeling more confident now; he played a great match.\u201d As for his own win over Gabashvili, which included the obligatory Isner tie-break, the Marathon Man said, \u201cWasn\u2019t too long [three hours seven minutes]. Obviously I have been out there a lot longer than five sets.\u201d",
