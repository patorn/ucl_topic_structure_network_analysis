  "body": "LA Galaxy take on draw specialists New England Six games unbeaten for Galaxy, and they go into Sunday\u2019s match-up with New England after a 1-1 draw against Sporting KC that they scarcely deserved.But they\u2019ll have to do without Robbie Keane, Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole. Keane and Gerrard remain injured, and Cole is banned, after being sent off for two needless yellows in a minute in KC: the first for time-wasting, weirdly, and the second for a dangerous tackle on Benny Feilhaber. Bruce Arena was unimpressed with the officiating. \u201cI have no idea [what happened],\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe need to publish law eighteen and make a lot of copies of that and send it off to everyone involved. Do you know what law eighteen is? Law eighteen is common sense. That\u2019s the law we definitely violate in every game.\u201dNew England, like the budding cartoonist with a fresh set of pencils, just can\u2019t stop drawing. They\u2019ve played 10 games this season and recorded only one win, but a whopping seven draws represent the most in MLS history at this stage, tieing the Rapids in 2015 and the 2006 Red Bulls. Diego Fagundez put the Revs one up against Orlando last week, but a host of missed chances meant Jay Heaps\u2019 team would have to make do with a point.\u201cI want to see us put the game away in the first half,\u201d Heaps said Tuesday. \u201cI thought we had chances to [v Orlando City]. I thought we had two or three chances to go up 2-0.\u201d Fagundez concurred: \u201cWe just really have to finish them at this point. We\u2019ve been trying so hard and the ball just doesn\u2019t want to go in for some reason, but we can\u2019t be frustrated with ourselves.\u201d After two months on the road, Toronto FC return home Finally, BMO Field is ready. After eight games on the road, and months of being locked out of home, TFC are back at their newly renovated, 30,000-seat stadium, after the second phase of its renovation was completed. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be back home in front of our fans at BMO Field,\u201d defender Steven Beitashour said on Tuesday. \u201cWith the renovations and playing under the lights, it\u2019s going to be amazing. I can\u2019t wait to be on the field.\u201d TFC trained on their new turf for the first time on Thursday night, and fans have been waiting for some time to see their star trio of Jozy Altidore, Sebastian Giovinco and Michael Bradley prove their worth on grass. Three wins, two draws and three defeats is a pretty decent return from their early-season run, although last week\u2019s 2-1 loss at Portland soured that somewhat, even if they were unfortunate with a succession of no-calls. (The Liam Ridgewell foul on Altidore was as clear a penalty as you\u2019ll see.) Now it\u2019s time for Toronto to show their home fans how much they\u2019ve improved from last year.   Related: Abby Wambach is a smart hire for a network with a relevancy problem    FC Dallas are the visitors on Saturday, and what a crazy result they suffered last week: a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of the previously impotent New York Red Bulls. That followed a 3-0 reverse at Vancouver, to go with that 5-0 stuffing by Houston Dynamo earlier this season. Dallas have been generally impressive this season, but recent results suggest a brittleness that Oscar Pareja has yet to solve. Matt Hedges\u2019 loss to injury was unfortunate, and the absence of Mauro Diaz has been telling, but they have issues at full-back \u2013 neither Ryan Hollingshead nor Atiba Harris are true defenders, and the team looks short of confidence. Victor Ulloa, though, insists his team isn\u2019t panicking. He called the Red Bulls loss a \u201cterrible, terrible result\u201d but said: \u201cWe have to find answers. We have to find a way to get results away from home. It\u2019s not the time panic, not yet. This is a time that we have to be united as a group and not let anything bring us down.\u201d Vancouver host Portland \u2013 and want revenge Last year, Portland knocked out Vancouver on their way to winning MLS Cup. The pair meet for the first time since then, and the Caps have something to prove. \u201cYou see a Cascadia Cup rival with a championship and you want to do it,\u201d Whitecaps keeper David Ousted said this week. Christian Bola\u00f1os is playing well, and has two goals in his last two games, but Kekuta Manneh is suspended after his crude foul on Federico Bravo last week. Manneh wasn\u2019t carded on the play, but MLS stepped in and handed down a retrospective punishment for \u201cserious foul play\u201d. It makes Vancouver\u2019s task more difficult. Portland\u2019s 2-1 victory over Toronto last week was certainly welcome, and Diego Valeri\u2019s free-kick was winner was simply wonderful. Up and over the wall from 30 yards, and Clint Irwin clutched thin air. The returning Ridgewell helped solidify Portland\u2019s backline, although he made several rustic challenges that on another day might have seen him sent off. Adam Kwarasey is still missing, but the Kiwi Jake Gleeson has impressed between the pipes, and Fanendo Adi now has seven goals to share a lead in the scoring charts. This one could be close. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a tense match,\u201d said Timbers coach Caleb Porter. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good teams the last few seasons and we\u2019ve had some good battles. Both of us are off to a start that\u2019s below what we want it to be, points are really important right now for both teams, and certainly they\u2019ll want to win. I think there\u2019ll be an edge to the game.\u201d High-flying Colorado host Real Salt Lake in Rocky Mountain Cup Raise your hand if you thought Colorado and RSL would be sitting in spots one and two in the West through week nine. And be honest. The pair propped up the Western Conference last season, and were rarely mentioned as possible contenders this time out, overshadowed by their rivals in California and Cascadia. But it\u2019s been all change so far: the Rapids and Real have been seriously impressive. The sides meet this weekend at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park, where the Rapids are perfect at 4-0-0. (Similarly, RSL are 100% at Rio Tinto, boasting the same record.) And the Rapids have suddenly found their scoring touch: their nine goals in the past four games have seen them rush to the top of the standings for the first time in four years. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything in particular,\u201d Rapids coach Pablo Mastroeni said of the scoring outburst. \u201cIt\u2019s guys still getting to know each other. It\u2019s being more opportunistic in front of goal, taking chances better \u2013 and obviously a couple set-piece goals as well.\u201d But Marco Pappa and Shk\u00eblzen Gashi have helped out Kevin Doyle and Luis Solignac in the Rapids\u2019 attack \u2013 and then there\u2019s Jermaine Jones. The veteran USMNT star has been nominated for MLS player of the month for his two goals and two assists in three games, and he\u2019s prospered in a new attacking role. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know that back in the day I was a striker,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI like to attack. I\u2019m not really a complete defense player. Most of my career I played it, but I prefer to attack the goal too.\u201d            First, though, the Rapids must get past Nick Rimando, who celebrated a Copa Centenario call-up this week. The RSL keeper has been in the league since 2000, but he\u2019s still producing stellar performances, and last week made a crucial stop to preserve his team\u2019s lead over Houston \u2013 with his face. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe next day it just felt like a really bad sunburn.\u201d Jordan Allen and Justen Glad also impressed against the Texans, and with Joao Plata and Yura Movsisyan starting to gel, RSL are in pretty decent shape. Their next home match isn\u2019t until 18 June. What better way to start their five-game road trip than beating their arch rivals. Orlando play the Red Bulls again Didn\u2019t these two sides just play each other? Two weeks ago the Red Bulls hosted Central Florida\u2019s finest in the midst of their early-season funk. Going into that game, last year\u2019s Supporters\u2019 Shield winners couldn\u2019t score, couldn\u2019t keep them out, and had just one win to show all season. But against Orlando it all came good: three goals, including two for Bradley Wright-Phillips, a narrow win, and their season began in earnest. Last week they beat Dallas 4-0. The Red Bulls are feeling good about themselves right now, and can extend their two-game winning streak on Friday night. Jesse Marsch isn\u2019t counting his chickens, though. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a little bit different because Kaka will feature in this game. We know that playing in Orlando will be different than playing at Red Bull Arena. We know what they are about, they know what we are about and it\u2019s going to be a great match-up.\u201d Orlando will be hoping the return of Aur\u00e9lien Collin won\u2019t haunt them. The French defender headed north to New Jersey last week, and head coach Adrian Heath admitted it was a wrench to see him leave. \u201cKnowing how these things can work out, there\u2019s obviously the feeling he could come back and get something for them,\u201d Heath said. We\u2019re aware of that. But it was a move we needed to make, at a time we needed to make it, and it might not have been there if we had waited any longer. Yes, it is a conference rival, but sometimes you can\u2019t pick and choose.\u201d One good piece of news was Kaka\u2019s non-call up for the Copa America. Brazil coach Dunga felt he could do without the 34-year-old for this summer\u2019s tournament, which is a shame for Copa fans, but good news for Orlando: it means the Brazilian is available for the entire MLS season. Friday is an opportunity to show Coach Dopey what he\u2019s missing.",
