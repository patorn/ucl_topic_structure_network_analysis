  "body": "Christian Horner appeared unsure whether to weep or crack open the champagne after a momentous Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday. Red Bull\u2019s team principal saw his drivers enjoy another very competitive weekend, but he also knew Daniel Ricciardo should have followed up Max Verstappen\u2019s sensational victory in Barcelona with another win here.   Related: F1 Monaco Grand Prix: five things we learned from Monte Carlo | Paul Weaver     The race was sealed with a brilliant drive from Lewis Hamilton but Ricciardo, who qualified on pole, would have triumphed but for a badly fumbled pit stop. Horner said: \u201cIt is frustrating to be disappointed with a second-place finish and to have pushed Mercedes really hard all weekend because there was a victory up for grabs. With a standard pit-stop we would be winners of Monte Carlo. \u201cWe are nine points from Ferrari in the constructors\u2019 championship, Daniel is third in the drivers\u2019 championship and we were competitive with our first pole position since 2013, so there were a lot of positives.\u201d Red Bull, and their junior team Toro Rosso were also boosted at the weekend by a new deal with the engine supplier Renault, which will make their engines in 2017 and 2018. Horner said: \u201cWe have had two very competitive weekends now. We have been very competitive against Mercedes but the true test will be in Montreal, to see how we fare there because it is a completely different type of venue. \u201cRenault have done a good job and the gain in the power unit is worth 0.2\u00a0seconds, so hopefully that will be worth more in Canada and Azerbaijan. It is a positive step forward so we are hoping that will make us much more competitive.\u201d Verstappen, who crashed out in Monaco following another crash in qualifying the previous day, will have an upgrade in Montreal. But the team also have to improve Ricciardo\u2019s mood after two desperately disappointing weekends. At Barcelona he was given a three-stop strategy to \u2018cover\u2019 Sebastian Vettel and then saw Verstappen win with a faster two-stop. He said: \u201cI took Barcelona on the chin and then took it well but two in a row now, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re in Mercedes\u2019 position, we\u2019re not able to win [every] race. \u201cSo to have an opportunity to lead two races in a row and especially here in Monaco \u2013 to get it wrong twice definitely hurts. I\u2019m not sure where we go from here, what to do.\u201d",
