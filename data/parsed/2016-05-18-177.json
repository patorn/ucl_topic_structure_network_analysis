  "body": "Name: Carry On. Age: 58 years. Appearance: Once or twice a year until the late 1970s. Then once in 1992. Reappearance: Next year! Are you trying to tell me they\u2019re making a new Carry On film, laced with sexual frustration and innuendo? I am. Who are \u201cthey\u201d? Some producer called Jonathan Sothcott and Brian Baker, who owns the rights, plus a new writing team. The Carry On films were very British, very cheap, very long-running, very scatological and artistically abject. Which modern comedy writers could reproduce that? Sothcott\u2019s hired Tim Dawson and Susan Nickson, who wrote Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps. Bingo! So what\u2019s the new film going to be called? Actually, they\u2019re making two. The first will be Carry On Doctors, about some doctors. The second will be Carry on Campus, about some students. They sound like a smashing pair. Watch yourself.   Related: Infamy! Infamy! Carry On films to carry on again after 25 years    I hope they bring them out soon so I can see them. That is your final warning. And which actors will they hire to be the modern-day Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jacques and all that lot? We don\u2019t know yet. Will they be required to have tortured private lives and die prematurely? Unlikely. The makers say they\u2019re going for a different approach. \u201cWe won\u2019t be trying to find new Sids or Kenneths,\u201d Sothcott says. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to create a whole new ensemble of brilliant British comedic actors. No stunt casting. No big American stars. This will be British film at its best, as the truly remarkable heritage deserves.\u201d Surely what the Carry On heritage deserves is that they just grind out more tat to make some money, like in the old days? Well, that\u2019s another opinion. Besides, will boob gags and bum-pinching really still be popular in post-Yewtree Britain? That\u2019s probably a no. But the new films will be updates, apparently, rather than remakes. \u201cWe intend to be sympathetic to the heritage,\u201d says Dawson, \u201cwhilst being unafraid to modernise the franchise for a whole new audience.\u201d It might work if they write scripts that puncture political correctness instead of prudery, as long as it stays light and not too shocking. It seems hard. I suppose it\u2019s all a question of how you handle it. Get out! Do say: \u201cCarry On Rebooting!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cI mean, if ever there was a case for not carrying on with something \u2026\u201d",
