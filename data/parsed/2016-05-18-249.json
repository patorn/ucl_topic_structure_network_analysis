  "body": "The scenes in tiny Ingolstadt when Bayern Munich secured a record fourth Bundesliga title in a row, weren\u2019t exactly ones of utter jubilation. The Bavarian giants celebrated in the visitors\u2019 dressing rooms after their victory over the home side, but were perhaps still slightly downbeat from their semi-final loss to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Champions League earlier in the week. Thousands of kilometres away however, a celebratory mood filled Cleo\u2019s Bar and Grill in Chicago, where dozens of fans and members of the official Bayern Munich Chicago fan club had gathered for an 8.30am kick-off. Shots of J\u00e4germeister and pints of Paulaner were shared, as they very likely were by Bayern fans throughout the US and North America. Bayern Munich is not yet synonymous with the world\u2019s elite soccer clubs whose reach stretches far beyond their home country: in comparison to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United, for example, the German champions don\u2019t yet have the kind of global reach that has transformed their club into a powerful international brand. Their Twitter account currently counts 2.8 million followers while the aforementioned clubs count 19.3 million, 17.5 million and 7.67 million followers, respectively.

Glimpses into the many established fan clubs within the United States and Canada provide the kind of route that Bayern will have to take to grow their brand. The club\u2019s launch of an office in New York City in 2014 that will \u201cwork to raise awareness of the FC Bayern brand in North America\u201d came very soon after Germany\u2019s World Cup win in 2014. The club will play three matches this summer in Chicago, New York and Charlotte as part of the International Champions Cup. Despite a record-setting Bundesliga title, the club\u2019s approach to expanding their reach into the US market will not be a traditional one. Soccer is as star-driven a sport as any other, but Bayern does not have a global star on their roster to compare to Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. Jose Miguel Burgos of International Soccer Consultants, a US-based soccer consultancy firm, believes that this won\u2019t hamper their approach in the lucrative US market. \u201cBayern Munich is going for a different demographic,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re going for the root. The other clubs are going after the millennials who are already watching three or four soccer clubs per weekend. We have a lot of those fans in America who can very well follow Manchester City, AC Milan and Barcelona at the same time.\u201d Based on what he\u2019s seen, Burgos believes Bayern are trying to appeal to fans who identify with the club rather than a specific player, and that the advantage they have is that they can relate to the actual \u201cmeat and potatoes\u201d of the American soccer world. \u201cThe American sports fan follows teams,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Japanese and Asian markets follow players. Americans are interested more in something long-term if they\u2019re going to devote their interest to soccer in the way Bayern Munich is thinking about it. Compared to any other major American sport, soccer is not seasonal. Soccer can last all year long. There is an emphasis on removing the superstar image from the equation. What happens if Cristiano Ronaldo leaves Real Madrid tomorrow?\u201d It is a player like Ronaldo that Bayern lacks. In ESPN Magazine\u2019s recent \u201cFame Issue,\u201d Ronaldo was ranked as the most famous athlete in the world with Barcelona\u2019s Lionel Messi and Neymar finishing third and fourth respectively.

The German national team are one of the favourites entering this summer\u2019s European Championships, and Matthias Schmitt of the Bayern Munich New York City fan club says that the club\u2019s membership is a reflection of the German national team. \u201cA lot of our members are fans of the German national team. Because Bayern Munich was always responsible for having a block of players on the German national team, it invariably led people to follow Bayern Munich,\u201d he says. In Toronto, a multicultural city with no shortage of transplanted fans that have connections to soccer clubs around the world, Bayern\u2019s fan club stretches throughout the entire International Sports Bar and Eatery. Here, dozens of fans gather every Saturday morning for Bundesliga matches and even more emerge for Champions League matches. While the club is less than two years old, fan club representatives speak of the incredible growth in that short time. I watched Bayern lose 1-0 to Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League final with the fan club. For Bayern fans, it was a painful loss. Another Bundesliga title and perhaps an 18th DFB-Pokal Cup this weekend would serve as a nice consolation prize. But it is the larger titles, specifically the Champions League that have eluded Bayern for the past three seasons, that could help increase their brand exponentially. \u201cUltimately, what it comes down to is consistent success at a high level,\u201d says Ryan Tune, deputy chair of the Bayern Toronto fan club. \u201cNo casual soccer fan is going to become a Bayern fan by [Bayern] winning the Bundesliga or winning the Pokal. They\u2019re only going to become fans when the team wins the Champions League or consistent Champions League success. That\u2019s the only way a person without some sort of deep-rooted connection that goes back to German heritage will become a Bayern fan.\u201d",
