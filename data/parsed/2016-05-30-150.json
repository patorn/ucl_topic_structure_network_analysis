Abe reportedly told senior members of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) that an increase planned for next April in the consumption, or sales tax, from the current 8% to 10%, would be delayed until October 2019. With Abe\u2019s term as LDP president due to end in 2018, the delay effectively leaves the measure \u2013 and any potential damage to the party\u2019s fortunes \u2013 to his successor. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s determination to postpone the tax increase seems to be very strong,\u201d the party\u2019s vice-president, Masahiko K\u014dmura, told reporters. Abe is desperate not to introduce another drag on consumer spending as doubts rise over his economic programme \u2013 a combination of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reform known as Abenomics. \u201cWe have no other options but to postpone the sales tax increase,\u201d Hakubun Shimomura, an Abe aide, said in a TV interview. \u201cIf the increase means a decline in tax revenue for the government, that would threaten our ability to achieve the goals of Abenomics.\u201d Abe, who is expected to confirm the postponement before an upper house election planned for July, was supposed to raised the consumption tax to 10% in October 2015, but announced in late 2014 that the change would be delayed until April 2017. The last rise in the sales tax, from 5% to 8% in April 2014, led to a plunge in consumer spending and dragged Japan back into a recession from which it has struggled to recover. Figures released on Monday showed retail sales fell in April for the second consecutive month, lending weight to those in Abe\u2019s party who believe a tax hike next spring would bury any hopes of kickstarting a sustained economic recovery. Government officials tried to dampen speculation that Abe would seek a public mandate for the move by calling a snap lower house election to coincide with the upper house poll. The finance minister, Tar\u014d As\u014d, is among several LDP figures who argue that Abe needs to go to the country to win backing for the delay. \u201cIf the tax increase is delayed, a general election is needed to put the plan to the public,\u201d Kyodo News quoted As\u014d as saying at the weekend. As\u014d and other fiscal hawks insist the tax rise, while unpopular with voters, is unavoidable if Japan is to rein in its huge public debt \u2013 now more than twice the size of its economy \u2013 and fund health and welfare services for its ageing population. Despite Japan\u2019s failure to reach inflation targets, a key part of Abe\u2019s prescription for the world\u2019s third-biggest economy, his support ratings have remained stable. A poll by the Nikkei business newspaper published on Monday showed his approval rating rose three percentage points from last month to 56% \u2013 the highest since September 2014. Abe has long said he would go ahead with the tax rise next April unless Japan was confronted by an economic crisis comparable to the Lehman shock. At the G7 summit in Ise-Shima last week, however, he failed to gain consensus that the world\u2019s economic problems merited comparisons with eight years ago. The British prime minister, David Cameron, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, were among those who thought his prognosis was overly bleak. The G7 leaders\u2019 declaration said only that \u201cgrowth remains moderate and uneven, and since we last met downside risks to the global outlook have increased\u201d.",
