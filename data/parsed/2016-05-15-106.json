  "body": "Seventeen female former government ministers including the International Monetary Fund chief, Christine Lagarde, have attacked the sexism and sexual harassment in the corridors of French power. Vowing to \u201cno longer be silenced\u201d, the women pledged to make public \u201call sexist remarks, inappropriate gestures and behaviour\u201d. \u201cIt concerns all parties, all levels of power, so we are taking up the pen to say it\u2019s too much, the omert\u00e0 and the law of silence are no longer possible,\u201d the op-ed in the Journal du Dimanche reads. \u201cWe have been ministers; we are or have been elected representatives. Like all women who reached circles that were once exclusively masculine, we have been forced to fight against sexism. It\u2019s not for women to adapt in these circles, it\u2019s the behaviour of certain men that must change. It\u2019s enough. The immunity has finished. We will no longer shut up,\u201d they wrote.   Related: \u2018We can no longer stay silent\u2019: fury erupts over sexism in French politics    \u201cWe encourage all victims of sexual harassment and sexual aggression to speak out and complain \u2026 we demand that our parties and groups verify if these acts have taken place and, if so, help the victims reveal the truth.\u201d The appeal was signed by women from across the political spectrum. From the centre right it was supported by Roselyne Bachelot, Chantal Jouanno, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Christine Lagarde and Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, among others. From the left, signatories include Fleur Pellerin, Rama Yade, \u00c9lisabeth Guigou as well as Dominique Voynet and C\u00e9cile Duflot from the Green party. \u201cWe went into politics for different reasons and we defend different ideas, but we share the belief that sexism has no place in our society. This scourge is not unique to our universe, far from it, but politics has a duty to be exemplary. Those who write laws, vote for them, must respect them and therefore be beyond reproach,\u201d the document continues. The blight of rampant sexism in French politics has been high on the agenda since Lagarde\u2019s predecessor, the one-time French presidential hopeful Dominque Strauss-Kahn, resigned as head of the IMF in 2011 following his arrest in New York over allegations of attempted rape and sexual assault of a hotel worker. Prosecutors later dropped the criminal charges against DSK, as he is known, and he settled a civil action with the hotel employee. Last week, after it was revealed that nine women had complained of alleged sexual harassment by Denis Baupin, who resigned as deputy speaker of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, Lib\u00e9ration\u2019s front-page headline read End the omert\u00e0 over sexism in parliament.   Related: French female journalists are fighting back against sexist politicians | L\u00e9na\u00efg Bredoux    Baupin, 53, who is married to Emmanuelle Cosse, leader of the Green party, has vehemently denied the allegations and said he will fight them. Shortly afterwards, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, admitted inappropriate behaviour towards a journalist. A petition in Lib\u00e9ration claimed many women in French politics did not speak out for fear of damaging their careers or their party. \u201cIt\u2019s time to speak out, to bring this impunity to an end, time for men to change their behaviour rather than for women to adapt to it,\u201d the petition said. In the JDD on Sunday, the op-ed said: \u201cIt cannot be said by a colleague that a woman, whatever her status, whether she be employee, student, unemployed, housewife or elected representative \u2018apart from her magnificent breasts, what\u2019s she like?\u2019.  \u201cIt cannot be said with a gravelly voice \u2018your skirt is too long, you should shorten it\u2019, or \u2018are you wearing a thong?\u2019 \u2026 and when a woman says no, it\u2019s no. No point insisting or carrying out reprisals.\u201d",
