All the same, preoccupied by later disasters, we have forgotten this most pointless of conflicts, which began as a fatuous diplomatic squabble and ended as a rehearsal for Armageddon; we need a rude reminder. More than 17 million soldiers and civilians died between 1914 and 1918, but such totals stupefy the brain and numb the heart. The Lost Tommies therefore deals with individuals, not an indiscriminate mass. Ross Coulthart\u2019s book rescues from oblivion a few hundred British combatants who fought in the trenches and foxholes of the Somme, and forces us to look at their depressed, bewildered or downright anguished faces.    Battle was industrialised, and the Somme was like an abattoir in which the men, as Wilfred Owen put it, died like cattle    Coulthart has edited and minutely annotated a photographic archive recently retrieved from a farmhouse in Picardy. Here, behind the staging lines on the western front, Louis and Antoinette Thuillier set up an amateurish studio to photograph troops billeted in the area. Their subjects stood solemnly to attention, though they sometimes cuddled local dogs or puffed on cigarette butts to stoke up their courage: they knew, as they often said in the letters they sent home enclosing these plaintive portraits, that they were posing for the benefit of loved ones who might never see them again. Later the Thuilliers photographed the makeshift crosses \u2013 \u201csome carved from the branches of trees, others made from old rifles and even roughly crossed propellers\u201d as Coulthart notes \u2013 that poked out of their burial mounds. At home in Liverpool, businesses like Cunard or the Stock Exchange rounded up their employees and marched them down to enlist as a job lot. Waving them off, the clerk who took their names remarked: \u201cI think you are all going to have a nice holiday.\u201d For Rupert Brooke, those who volunteered were \u201cswimmers into cleanness leaping\u201d. The recruits photographed by the Thuilliers, however, experienced no ritual purification: they had been sent to grovel in mud, filth and gore.     The Lost Tommies by Ross Coulthart Photograph: Courtesy Kerry Stokes Collection, The Louis and Antoinette Thuillier Collection    In a village hall they attended lectures on \u201cthe science of butchery\u201d, with instructions about precisely aiming their bayonets to pierce the enemy\u2019s liver or kidneys. A constant artillery barrage ruined their nerves and made them quake and twitch; in the trenches their meagre uniforms were infested by lice, and they were forced to watch rats gnaw the bodies of their fallen comrades in no man\u2019s land. Field doctors reported on unimaginable horrors: half a Tommy, his lower body blown away, gasped: \u201cOh\u00a0chum, help me!\u201d, which prompted\u00a0his corporal to euthanise him with a shot of morphine. To begin with, the men in the photographs exhibit brave grins, pleased to be doing their duty to king and country. But the book concludes with a different gallery, a lineup of shellshocked officers from a Yorkshire regiment. Their faces sag into paralytic dismay; their eyes blankly gaze into a distance where the experiences that have psychologically wounded them are endlessly re-enacted. Coulthart\u2019s commentary acidly sums up the muddle that doomed these ill-prepared men. It was not until 1916 that the British infantry was issued with steel helmets to deflect bullets; the dandified French wore brightly coloured uniforms that made them \u201ceasy targets for German gunners\u201d. Previous wars had been conducted like\u00a0chivalrous tournaments, but now the swaggering lancers on their emaciated nags were instantly cut down by German machine guns. Battle had been industrialised, and the\u00a0Somme resembled an abattoir in\u00a0which the victims, as Wilfred Owen\u00a0put it, died like cattle.    Today we worry about zealots who are happy to die for a cause; this perversity has its origins in the first world war    Propagandists promised that this war would end all wars. Instead it almost automatically provoked those that followed. In 1916 a British officer condemned a prospective attack at Fromelles \u2013 which went ahead despite his misgivings \u2013 as \u201ca bloody holocaust\u201d. What Coulthart describes is a slaughter as systematic as the Nazi genocide, perpetrated by generals such as Haig and Kitchener who deployed their own country\u2019s miners, navvies and labourers as cannon fodder and dismissed casualties as \u201cacceptable losses\u201d. Today we worry about zealots who are happy to die for their cause; this perversity too has its origins in the first world war, when a corps of machine-gunners was nicknamed the Suicide Club because of its inadequate equipment. Coulthart recalls a cavalry officer who \u201crode his horse out in full view of the Germans\u201d to rally his troops, shouting \u201cStick it, men \u2026 and for God\u2019s sake put up a good fight\u201d \u2013 a Christian paraphrase, I\u2019d suggest, of the salute to Allah intoned by Isis fanatics as they detonate their vests. He was instantly killed by German fire, but posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Back then, his initiative counted as extraordinary valour; now it seems more like messianic folly. Give me a chocolate soldier any time. War with its cult of heroism is humanity\u2019s death wish, and The Lost Tommies makes me grateful for my self-protective cowardice.
