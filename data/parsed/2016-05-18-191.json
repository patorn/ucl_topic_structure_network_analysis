Ben Butler, 36, told a jury at the Old Bailey his trial was a repeat of a miscarriage of justice he suffered in 2007 when he was arrested and subsequently jailed for assaulting his then seven-week-old daughter Ellie. After the prosecutor accused him of deflecting all the blame for Ellie\u2019s death away from the evidence and on to anyone but himself, Butler told jurors: \u201cI was watching the Hillsborough thing the other night,\u201d he said in reference to a BBC documentary on the disaster in which 96 people lost their lives. \u201cThe families in it [the documentary], they were fighting for justice just like we were, and a lady came on and said, \u2018The problem you don\u2019t see is the ripple effect and that one action has on everyone\u2019s life,\u2019\u201d said Butler. \u201cThat 2007 [injury to Ellie] had a ripple effect on everyone\u2019s lives,\u201d he told jurors. Ellie died when she was at home with Butler in October 2013, while her mother was at work. A postmortem showed that she had a fracture almost the entire length of her skull with injuries likened by experts to those in a high-speed car crash. Butler has told jurors it was an accident and admitted not calling for an ambulance for hours after he discovered her unconscious. He said he had suffered \u201cunbelievable loss and pain\u201d and that at times he \u201chated\u201d his partner, Jennie Gray, because of the illness she suffered as a direct consequence of the miscarriage of justice and the absence of Ellie from their lives. \u201cThere were times I\u2019m having to pick her up off the floor every day because she\u2019s drunk and drinking, she\u2019s trying to kill herself \u2026 putting pills in her mouth and me trying to get them out,\u201d he said. Under cross-examination Butler admitted to past violence including assaulting a man in a kebab shop in 2004. He also accepted a caution for hitting his ex-girlfriend in 2005 but told jurors on Wednesday that she had \u201cwalloped him harder than any man ever did\u201d. He denied concocting \u201ca sophisticated charade\u201d on the day Ellie died. He was questioned repeatedly about his failure to call 999 immediately after he said he found his daughter lying on the floor unconscious. He told jurors he knew he would be blamed for her death because of the earlier conviction for assaulting her. Jurors heard for the second time the harrowing 999 call that starts with Gray screaming so loudly down the phone that the operator cannot decipher her words. Butler is heard shouting in the background.  Ed Brown, prosecuting, accused Butler of staging the drama in the call, of injecting \u201ca sense of urgency\u201d because they both knew it was two hours too late for anyone to bring Ellie back to life. He said he and Gray had deliberately deceived the operator by urging them to hurry up. \u201cYou were there on the telephone blaming a person who was trying to help you for delaying when you sat on her death for two hours,\u201d Brown said to him. \u201cWhy did I do that?\u201d responded Butler. \u201cBecause you killed her, Mr Butler.\u201d \u201cNot because I killed her, not at all because I killed her, the mistake you [the legal system] made in 2007 is the only reason I reacted like that,\u201d replied Butler. Jurors heard Butler tell the operator: \u201cI have just come upstairs and my little girl has fallen down.\u201d There were repeated attempts by Gray to revive her daughter after being instructed in CPR. Brown put it to Butler that \u201cthis 999 call, together with the cover-up that happened for two hours, those terrible actions by you helped by Jennie Gray can only have been taken by a man who truly had something devastating to hide\u201d. Butler said Brown had got it all wrong and he needed to accept that he had not assaulted Ellie when she was seven weeks old, but had \u201csaved her life\u201d. \u201cI rushed my daughter to hospital, I probably saved her life that day and all of a sudden I\u2019m in a seven-year court battle,\u201d he said in reference to his appeal followed by a battle to be reunited with Ellie in the family courts. Brown then moved cross-examination on to allegations that Butler sometimes lost control of his temper. Taking him through 16 pages of abusive text exchanges with Gray, Brown suggested that his partner was \u201cterrified of being hit by you and threats by you to actual and very serious violence\u201d. In one she complains of being \u201ckneed in the tits and pussy and kicked me out\u201d. Butler said he did not know what that was about other than he was not interested in sex with her at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s plain evidence of being violent to her,\u201d suggested Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s a threat of violence,\u201d Butler replied, referring to his earlier evidence that he only made hollow threats to Gray because she repeatedly abandoned her children. \u201cI\u2019m acting like this because she\u2019s not there for the kids,\u201d says Butler. Brown suggested the threats were in fact very real. Explaining one text, Butler said he was blaming her for not recognising Ellie was sick before she dropped her off the day she collapsed with what was originally thought to be shaken baby syndrome. \u201cOur arguments led to me pushing her and things like that, I\u2019m not hitting her,\u201d he said. \u201cYou say I\u2019ve killed my daughter. I haven\u2019t killed my daughter \u2026 What am I on trial for, either rowing with my wife or my children?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re saying because I\u2019m guilty of XY, I\u2019m guilty of Z. There was nothing wrong that day, there\u2019s no marks [on Ellie], you know full well \u2026 I\u2019m 100%. Ellie wouldn\u2019t have died that day without the problems she had,\u201d he said repeating assertions that she had a brain injury at birth. \u201cAnother child might have banged her head and cried and wouldn\u2019t have died,\u201d he said.  Butler denies murder. He and Gray deny another charge of child cruelty relating to an allegedly untreated broken shoulder that was discovered in Ellie\u2019s postmortem.",
