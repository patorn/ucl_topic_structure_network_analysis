  "body": "The public library is \u201ca source of learning and nourishment for young and old and everyone else\u201d, says Stephen Fry in a new documentary tracing the history of the institution in the UK, from its working-class roots in 1752 to its precipitous decline today. The documentary, launching on Monday evening, is the work of poet and filmmaker Greta Bellamacina and journalist Davina Catt. It is a call to arms for the survival of the embattled public library, more than 500 branches of which have closed since 2010. Backed by names from Fry to Irvine Walsh and Daisy Goodwin, it charts the rise and fall of the public library in Britain, from how the first ever public library was built by Scottish miners in Leadhills in 1752, to the passing of the first Public Library Act in 1850, giving local boroughs the right to establish libraries, and the protests up and down the country at library closures today.  \u201cLibraries have an amazing place in human history,\u201d says Fry in the documentary, which has its premiere in London on Monday evening, and will then be shown at independent cinemas through the Our Screen initiative. \u201cThere is a generation since the late 19th century of writers and artists from more deprived classes \u2013 DH Lawrence, people like that \u2013 whose educations were a mixture of the Education Act which meant that children had to be educated, and the full provision of libraries throughout the kingdom, which suddenly meant that the working classes who had been denied this were given a voice.\u201d   Related: Council closed libraries to cut costs, then spent more to guard them    Speaking of the influence that finding a copy of The Importance of Being Earnest in his local mobile library had on him as a child, Fry said that \u201cthere\u2019s been a terrible sense that libraries should just be a kind of adjunct to a council building where you can get free internet access and a few newspapers, and that\u2019s it \u2013 rather than understand it as a source of learning and nourishment for young and old and everyone else\u201d.           The Safe House: a documentary on the decline of UK libraries \u2013 trailer video    Bellamacina told the Guardian that the future of the public library \u2013 more than 64 closed while she was filming the documentary, and it is estimated that a further 11 will close this year \u2013 \u201cfeels in a dangerous place right now\u201d. \u201cThe essence of the documentary is that libraries were built by the working classes, and belonged to everyone as a symbol of equality and opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to around 100 libraries in the course of making this documentary, and it seems like \u2026 so many are just hanging on. It feels like we are wiping them out in just one generation.\u201d The last scene shot for the documentary was at the Carnegie library in Lambeth, south London, which was occupied by locals protesting at the closure plans. \u201cIt was so inspiring to see people taking days off to sleep in the library \u2013 there were more than 40 there when we got there,\u201d said Bellamacina, who believes she would not \u201chave gone on to do half the stuff I\u2019ve done if I hadn\u2019t had the resource of the public library as a child\u201d.

To \u2026 take them away again is a step backwards,\u201d say Bellamacina and Catt in the film. \u201cLibraries are free from prejudice, modern, open, timeless \u2013 filled with magic and wonder. They continue to be relevant, they continue to be needed and we must continue to fight for them or the sense of loss and heartbreak will outlive us all.\u201d",
