  "body": "Two indigenous Shipibo men from Peru\u2019s Amazon - Sedequ\u00edas Anc\u00f3n Ch\u00e1vez and Robert Guimaraes Vasquez - paid a rare visit to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) earlier this month. The reason? To present a letter addressed to Marcus Stuttard, Claire Dorrian and Umerah Akram from the LSE\u2019s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) urging AIM to investigate, suspend and bar a company called United Cacao Limited SEZC - as well as amend its rules and \u201cexact more active oversight\u201d in general. \u201cThe nature of the crimes which the company stands accused are an important matter for AIM to address,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAllowing companies listed on AIM to raise capital to violate other countries\u2019 national laws jeopardizes the \u201cintegrity and reputation\u201d of the market, which is grounds for suspension of a company\u2019s trading, according to AIM Rules.\u201d The letter, accompanied by a 28-page report by the NGO Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) supported by almost 400 pages of annexes, states that AIM now has the opportunity to set an important example:  The potential precedents set by AIM\u2019s action on this case will have global relevance for stock exchanges, market actors, the global climate, and our planet\u2019s population \u2013 including indigenous peoples and forest communities most directly affected by land and natural resource governance. . . Funds raised on international stock exchanges should not be available for companies operating in violation of the law, threatening the rights and resources of indigenous peoples, and causing serious environmental damage.  The Guardian sought comment from United Cacao about the key accusations made against it and related companies - and it denies all of them.  The first accusation is illegally deforesting at least 11,118 hectares of \u201cmostly primary tropical rainforest.\u201d United Cacao\u2019s reply, sent through UK-based PR firm Tavistock Communications, is that it has only \u201c3,787 hectares of agriculturally zoned, freehold land\u201d and \u201cthere is clear and documented evidence of existing agricultural activities for each land parcel the Company owns.\u201d  Only 3,787 hectares? That doesn\u2019t take into account United Cacao\u2019s financial statements revealing that, by December 2014, it had provided more than US$3 million to two companies called Plantaciones de Pucallpa and Plantaciones de Ucayali - both of which are directly connected to United Cacao\u2019s CEO Dennis Melka - which have deforested at least 9,174 hectares to cultivate oil palm.  Land where agriculture already existed? Analysis of satellite images published in June 2015 by the Amazon Conservation Association and ACCA-Conservaci\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica claimed that 98% of United Cacao\u2019s project area near a town called Tamshiyacu was, before the company\u2019s arrival in 2013, primary forest. \u201cWe confirm that the area cleared by United Cacao in 2013 was dominated by primary forest,\u201d the NGOs stated. A similar conclusion was made by Greg Asner, from the US\u2019s Carnegie Institution for Science, after using LIDAR technology to measure carbon stocks as part of a joint Carnegie-Ministry of Environment project. \u201cThe logical conclusion from the scientific data is that large-statured, intact forest was removed by this deforestation event [i.e. United Cacao\u2019s plantation],\u201d Asner told Mongabay in a January 2015 article. A second accusation is that United Cacao and related companies ignored three Peruvian government orders in December 2014 and September 2015 to cease operating at three plantations. United Cacao\u2019s reply is that it \u201chas only one plantation, not three\u201d, and \u201chas complied with all requests from the authorities and operates in full compliance with the law.\u201d \u201cOnly one plantation\u201d? Again, that doesn\u2019t include the Plantaciones de Pucallpa and Plantaciones de Ucayali oil palm plantations.  \u201cComplied with all requests from the authorities\u201d? In December 2014 United Cacao\u2019s subsidiary Cacao del Peru Norte was ordered by the Office of Agrarian Environmental Affairs (DGAAA) within the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) to stop operating at Tamshiyacu, but analysis of satellite images published in March 2016 by the Amazon Conservation Association and ACCA-Conservaci\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica claimed that deforestation not only continued in 2015 but actually increased. Furthermore, overflights of Tamshiyacu by Peruvian NGOs Sociedad Peruana de Ecodesarrollo and Ken\u00e9 in March 2015 and October 2015 both claimed to show the company was continuing to operate. It isn\u2019t only civil society organisations arguing that United Cacao ignored the DGAAA\u2019s order. In response to a company statement made on 5 May in immediate reply to the indigenous delegation\u2019s trip to the LSE, Peru\u2019s national forest authority, SERFOR, issued a searing condemnation yesterday of United Cacao and claimed that \u201cmulti-temporal analysis\u201d of satellite images showed it had continued to deforest and thereby ignored the DGAAA\u2019s request for the \u201ctemporary total paralysation of all its agricultural activities related to cultivating cacao.\u201d  The statement by SERFOR, also part of MINAGRI, claimed that Cacao del Peru Norte \u201chas been trying to show internationally that it has observed the country\u2019s laws\u201d when \u201cthere are two national authorities, the DGAAA and SERFOR, which have argued the opposite.\u201d It ended its statement by urging the LSE to \u201csupport the position of the Peruvian state expressed by the DGAAA and SERFOR, ensuring that the companies associated with it do what is required of them.\u201d A third accusation is that United Cacao has made a series of \u201cmisrepresentations and material omissions\u201d in public statements, including \u201cclaiming to have followed all environmental approval procedures when official documents demonstrate that this is not the case.\u201d The company\u2019s reply is that an Environmental Impact Assessment isn\u2019t required for its Tamshiyacu plantation and that instead a Programa de Adecuaci\u00f3n y Manejo Ambiental (PAMA) is the \u201cagreed upon and authorised environmental certification\u201d, that it is \u201cin the process of submitting a completed PAMA\u201d, that \u201cfinal approval\u201d is expected this year, and that the company \u201cis allowed to work whilst the PAMA is progressed.\u201d Is a PAMA really the \u201cagreed upon and authorised environmental certification\u201d? Not according to EIA\u2019s report to the AIM, nor the DGAAA, nor Minister of Agriculture Juan Benites Ramos in a presentation to Peru\u2019s Congress in October 2014. According to a November 2012 law, a PAMA can only apply to deforestation that took place before that law was passed, yet Cacao del Peru Norte began deforesting at Tamshiyacu in May 2013, according to its Admission Document to the AIM. Therefore, EIA asserts, what the company required was an Environmental Impact Assessment, not a PAMA, and it should have been approved before operations began. SERFOR asserts that United Cacao is violating Peruvian law on this issue too. Its recent statement argues that Cacao del Peru Norte - using capital letters at this point - \u201cDOES NOT HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL CERTIFICATION APPROVED BY THE DGAAA\u201d and \u201cDOES NOT HAVE ANY PAMA NOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TOOL APPROVED.\u201d It rejected, too, the company\u2019s argument that having had the Terms of Reference for a PAMA approved means it can carry on operating.  Indeed, EIA\u2019s Rose Davis argues that, even if a PAMA was the \u201cright environmental tool\u201d, United Cacao still violated the law because it started operating before it had submitted the Terms of Reference for it, let alone had the Terms or the PAMA itself approved. She believes that the company effectively admitted this wrongdoing in its 5 May statement which, she says, shows \u201cclear disregard for Peruvian law and misrepresents the legality of the company\u2019s operations to investors.\u201d  \u201cMelka claims that the PAMA is under evaluation, though we\u2019ve seen no evidence that it was ever submitted,\u201d Davis says. \u201cBut even if it was, it was too late for the over 1000 hectares of rainforest already lost.\u201d  Irrespective of whether the PAMA is the \u201cright environmental tool\u201d, or whether or not United Cacao\u2019s handling of it already means it has violated the law, how seriously can we take the company\u2019s interest in it anyway? It refused to tell the Guardian when the government requested it to present a PAMA, but it must have been before 10 September 2013, and yet now, almost mid-2016, the company still hasn\u2019t done so. A fourth accusation - again related to \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and environmental procedures - is that United Cacao failed to obtain permission, at Tamshiyacu, to convert forest into land that can be used for agriculture, as is required by Peruvian law. The company\u2019s reply is that \u201cno permission was required given the land was transferred free of restrictions\u201d, following a 1997 law, \u201cand agricultural activities had previously been carried out on the land by the former owners resulting in there being no change of use in any case.\u201d It argues that \u201cthe courts have ruled on this extensively in favour of the Company\u201d, as have various state institutions. \u201cNo permission required\u201d? According to EIA\u2019s report to the AIM, United Cacao is relying on an outdated interpretation of the 1997 law that wasn\u2019t issued by the right authority within MINAGRI, that failed to take into account Peru\u2019s then current Forestry Law, and that was subsequently corrected by a DGAAA report in October 2014. That United Cacao needed to obtain permission for \u201cland use change\u201d was also argued by other MINAGRI reports that same year. \u201cThough the matter has been clarified legally for over a year, United Cacao continues to argue that its subsidiary, Cacao del Peru Norte, did not require a land use change authorization to destroy the forest and replace it with a plantation,\u201d EIA states. Again, SERFOR\u2019s position is similar. Permission for \u201cland use change\u201d was needed by United Cacao, it argued in its recent statement, but the company never acquired it. \u201cIt should be noted that any company that has property title to land must first obtain an Environmental Certification (approved by the DGAAA) and then Change of Use Authorization (approved by the Regional Authority on Forests and Wildlife) in order to develop large-scale, agroindustrial activities,\u201d SERFOR stated. What about United Cacao\u2019s claim that there was \u201cno change of use in any case\u201d? As stated above, it is claimed that satellite images show the vast majority of the project area was primary forest before the company\u2019s arrival. How does going from that and no doubt a few small-scale family agricultural plots to an industrial-sized cacao plantation not constitute a change of land use? A fifth accusation is that United Cacao\u2019s operations and/or financing have violated indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, including those enshrined in the International Labour Organization\u2019s Convention 169, the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, and the UN\u2019s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The company\u2019s reply is that \u201csuch claims are baseless. There are no indigenous communities anywhere near the Company\u2019s estate.\u201d But what about the Plantaciones de Pucallpa plantation? According to EIA\u2019s report, that has deforested at least 500 hectares \u201cin the area of the Native Community Santa Clara de Uchunya.\u201d The letter to AIM was signed by 43 Peruvian organisations, 18 organisations from the EU and US and nine individuals, and argues that things could get much worse if the AIM doesn\u2019t take rapid, meaningful action. According to the signatories, United Cacao, its subsidiaries and other Melka-associated companies have obtained or are trying to obtain \u201csubstantially more land\u201d across Peru\u2019s Amazon for large-scale plantations. \u201cHowever, only a small percentage of land in the Amazon regions where these properties are located is suitable for agricultural purposes,\u201d the letter reads. How much is \u201csubstantially more land\u201d? A November 2015 report by the Ministry of Environment states that Melka-associated companies are eyeing up 66,000 hectares for oil palm: 20,000 hectares of \u201cnatural primary forests\u201d in the River Maniti basin and approximately 46,000 hectares adjacent to the buffer zone of the Allpahuayo Mishana National Reserve and indigenous communities. An EIA report published in April 2015 put the number even higher: more than 96,000 hectares.  The letter to AIM also mentions a recent \u201cpreliminary decision\u201d by the Roundtable for Responsible Palm Oil (RSPO) on Plantaciones de Pucallpa, an RSPO member. The RSPO found that the company appears to have \u201ccleared primary forest progressively since 2011\u201d and \u201cdid not have the environmental permit as required by the Peruvian laws\u201d, and ordered it to cease any \u201cfurther land clearance and planting activities\u201d until the complaint made against it is resolved. \u201cThe RSPO\u2019s decision has nothing to do with United Cacao,\u201d the company told the Guardian, despite its links to both Plantaciones de Pucallpa and Plantaciones de Ucayali. \u2018[It] is cultivating cacao, not palm oil.\u201d EIA\u2019s Davis says that the connections between these companies is an issue their appeal to AIM is also intended to address.  \u201c[Those two companies] have received millions in financing from United Cacao in the form of related party transactions,\u201d Davis says. \u201cThe potential reputational damage for AIM from the related companies\u2019 illegal activities is thus based on the related party transaction financing link, the fact that Dennis Melka is the legal representative of all of these companies, and that the Ucayali region operations are referred to in Melka\u2019s statements about his plantation experience to investors.\u201d United Cacao plays down the connection between the companies. It acknowledged to the Guardian that there was a \u201cshort term loan\u201d, but it \u201coccurred prior to United Cacao \u201cgoing public\u201d and the holding company of [Plantaciones de Pucallpa and Plantaciones de Ucayali] fully repaid the loan prior to United Cacao joining AIM on 2 December 2014. Since then there has been no collaboration (financial or otherwise) between United Cacao and the other two private palm oil businesses.\u201d The company denies it is violating AIM rules. \u201cUnited Cacao complies fully with the AIM Rules and the regulators,\u201d it told the Guardian. \u201cDennis Melka addressed this and other allegations in a recent interview.\u201d According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) today, an 11 May letter from the LSE to EIA states that it is investigating United Cacao and that the allegations against the company have been referred to AIM Regulation. The WSJ article states that a United Cacao spokesman, after viewing the SERFOR statement, said that United Cacao hadn\u2019t been contacted by SERFOR and the company \u201coperates in full compliance with all applicable Peruvian and environmental law.\u201d Disclaimer: One of the 70 signatories to the letter to the AIM was the NGO Global Witness, for which David Hill works as a consultant, but this article was written in Hill\u2019s capacity as a Guardian environment writer.",
