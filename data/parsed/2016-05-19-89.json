Describing the sentence as \u201cperhaps the most unjust sentence in the history of the military justice system\u201d, attorneys for Manning complained that she had been portrayed as a traitor to the US when \u201cnothing could be further from the truth\u201d. \u201cNo whistleblower in American history has been sentenced this harshly,\u201d states the appeal, which also alleges that Manning was excessively charged and illegally held while awaiting trial in conditions amounting to solitary confinement. It suggests that her sentence be reduced to 10 years.   Chelsea Manning appeal   The appeal sharply contrasts the government\u2019s punishment of Manning with the two years probation given to David Petraeus, the retired military commander and CIA director, who admitted giving classified information to his biographer, with whom he was having an extramarital affair. While Manning was a whistleblower, Petraeus \u201capparently disclosed the materials for sex\u201d, say Manning\u2019s attorneys. Manning, a 28-year-old former US army private, was convicted in 2013 of multiple crimes for passing an estimated 700,000 documents to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group. The cache included diplomatic cables and reports on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Attorneys for Manning filed the appeal documents on Wednesday to the US army court of criminal appeals at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The documents were made public on Thursday after being reviewed by officials for possible redaction of classified material. Manning, a transgender woman previously known as Bradley, is serving her sentence at the Fort Leavenworth military base in Kansas. \u201cManning disclosed the materials because under the circumstances she thought it was the right thing to do,\u201d said the appeal brief. \u201cShe believed the public had a right to know about the toll of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the loss of life, and the extent to which the government sought to hide embarrassing information of its wrongdoing.\u201d Manning\u2019s appeal said her sentence was unfairly inflated by the military judge\u2019s misreading of relevant laws and by \u201coverzealous\u201d prosecutors deciding to charge her with more severe crimes than the mishandling of classified information, to which she admitted. She was initially charged with \u201cstealing or converting databases\u201d, despite the original records remaining intact. \u201cBut stealing or converting photocopies of documents within a filing cabinet is not the same as stealing the filing cabinet itself,\u201d Manning\u2019s attorneys argued. The government later amended these charges but only after each side had presented its case. The appeal also claimed the sentence also did not take into account the time she served in \u201cdeplorable and inhumane conditions\u201d of confinement before her trial, which are described as unconstitutional and sufficient grounds for dismissing the charges altogether. Manning\u2019s attorneys requested that she be credited 10 days of time served for every day she spent in these \u201coutrageous and completely unjustified\u201d pretrial conditions, which would effectively wipe out seven years of the total sentence. The appeal urged authorities to consider the context of Manning suffering from mental health problems and stress, which it blames on her inability to live openly as a transgender woman in the US military. \u201cThe government\u2019s litigation strategy was to ignore all of this, and to instead make an example of her,\u201d it said.   Related: When will the US government stop persecuting whistleblowers? | Chelsea Manning    In a simultaneously filed brief supporting Manning\u2019s appeal, the American Civil Liberties Union said the Espionage Act used to convict Manning was \u201cunconstitutionally vague\u201d because it \u201callows the government to subject speakers and messages it dislikes to discriminatory prosecution\u201d. The ACLU said Manning\u2019s prosecution was separately unconstitutional because the military judge overseeing the trial barred Manning from asserting any defense on the basis that the information she disclosed was in the public interest. \u201cA war against whistleblowers is being waged in this country and this case represents how this country treats anyone who reveals even a single page of classified information,\u201d Nancy Hollander, one of Manning\u2019s attorneys, said in a statement. \u201cWe need brave individuals to hold the government accountable for its actions at home and abroad and we call upon this court to overturn the dangerous precedent of Chelsea Manning\u2019s excessive sentencing.\u201d In another brief backing Manning, the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI) said her \u201coverall motive was to advance the public interest\u201d and \u201cthe public interest value of some of the disclosures justifies mitigation of the sentence\u201d. In support of this argument, the brief quoted the Guardian\u2019s former investigations editor David Leigh and John Kerry, now the US secretary of state, who as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee said that disclosures within the Afghan war logs leaked by Manning \u201craise serious questions about the reality of America\u2019s policy toward Pakistan and Afghanistan\u201d. The OSJI brief also argued that Manning\u2019s sentence was \u201cfar higher than the penalties that our closest allies would consider proportionate\u201d. The brief featured a survey of 30 such countries that pointed to a maximum 14-year sentence in Canada as the next stiffest penalty for a comparable conviction.",
