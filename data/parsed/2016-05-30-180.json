  "body": "Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has hinted that he would like to see Ed Miliband serve in his shadow cabinet, after appearing alongside the former party leader during a pro-EU event and in interviews. In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Corbyn said his predecessor was \u201ca great friend\u201d and \u201ca great asset\u201d and he refused to rule out offering him a job. Asked if he wanted to see Miliband back in the shadow cabinet, Corbyn told Pienaar\u2019s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cThat is all for the future.\u201d When it was put to him that Miliband could be seen as a loser because of what happened in the 2015 general election, Corbyn replied: \u201cEd is not a great loser, Ed is a great asset. Yes, he led the party; yes, we did not win the general election \u2013 we all know that. \u201cBut Ed fought a strong campaign \u2013 he raised the issue of justice at work over zero-hours contracts and issues like that, and I have a lot of respect and a lot of time for Ed.\u201d Miliband, who has kept a relatively low profile since resigning as leader last year, said on Friday when asked about the possibility of taking a frontbench job that he was \u201chappy getting on with being a backbencher\u201d. But he has been much more positive about Corbyn\u2019s leadership than many others who served in the shadow cabinet in the last parliament, and at the end of last week the two men spoke at an EU referendum event together. During the campaign rally in Doncaster, the first time the pair have spoken since the change of leadership, Corbyn posted a picture of Miliband on the social media app Snapchat with the caption: \u201cAwesome.\u201d The former home secretary Alan Johnson has also spoken of his support for Miliband and how he hopes the former Labour leader would return to the frontbench.  \u201cEd is hugely talented. I sat with him in the cabinet when he was the environment secretary \u2013 he is a young up-and-coming person,\u201d Johnson told the Press Association. \u201cHe should be welcomed back on the frontbench.\u201d  Asked if he thought Miliband\u2019s return to frontline politics would happen, he said: \u201cI think so, I hope so.\u201d Separately, Tony Blair denied reports that remarks he made in an interview on Saturday about how it would be \u201cvery dangerous\u201d if a leftwing populist took power were aimed at Corbyn. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about Jeremy Corbyn ... I was talking about the general populism there is in the world today,\u201d the former Labour prime minister told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. In a BBC interview broadcast on Saturday, Blair said: \u201cIt would be a very dangerous experiment for a major western country to get gripped by this type of populist policymaking left or right.\u201d This was widely taken as a reference to Corbyn because Blair was responding to a question that specifically mentioned him. Blair told Marr he was \u201cnot being disloyal\u201d to the current Labour leader and, although he said he was waiting to see what policies Corbyn produced, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t disrespect him as a person, or his views at all.\u201d He also said he would be backing Labour at the general election even if Corbyn remained leader. \u201cI\u2019ll always tell people to vote Labour because I\u2019m Labour. That\u2019s just the way I am,\u201d he said.",
