Related: Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory won\u2019t end Islamophobia, but it offers hope | Homa Khaleeli    Throughout the campaign, Khan\u2019s Tory rival, Zac Goldsmith, had been promising all kinds of trouble if the city fell prey to this advocate of \u201cdivisive and radical\u201d politics, and became the first western capital to elect a Muslim mayor. While polls were still open on Thursday, the American blogger Matt Drudge had made his own helpful intervention, foretelling a troubling hotbed of extremism that even had its own scary, Muslim-y nickname. Beware the mayor of Londonistan! In the event, the only detectable unrest, on social media and inside City Hall itself, was over the lengthy delay last night in confirming what everyone had known for hours. Khan had not only triumphed but romped home, defeating Goldsmith by a humiliating 57%-43% margin, on the highest turnout in London mayoral history. His victory was evident from first thing in the morning \u2013 City Hall had considerately sucked all the drama out of the count by posting detailed running tallies throughout the day as the votes were counted \u2013 and increasingly assured as the day went on. At 3.30pm, the psephologist John Curtice got fed up waiting and declared victory for Khan on the BBC.            Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor    But election tellers won\u2019t be rushed, particularly in the event of \u201csmall discrepancies\u201d in their tallies, and as sunny afternoon turned to evening and then to night, Khan and his team were sequestered on the seventh floor of City Hall, the soon-to-be mayor reportedly having a nap ahead of the victory party he would shortly be obliged to attend. One floor above him, Zac Goldsmith was rumoured to have been billeted in the office his chum Boris Johnson vacated on Wednesday, and which would emphatically not now be his. As if electoral humiliation wasn\u2019t enough, the millionaire MP had been forced to endure a long and lonely afternoon and evening, during which his party colleagues queued up to denounce his \u201cappalling\u201d, \u201cfoolish\u201d, \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cnasty\u201d campaign, and even his sister Jemima Khan suggested she had opposed the strategy pushed by his advisers. When they finally emerged, well after midnight, it was Khan who looked the more exhausted of the two. Goldsmith, a head taller, hands clasped in front and chewing his lip slightly, looked almost relieved.  When his victory was at last announced, to roars from his team and a few limp claps from his opponent, Khan could manage only a flicker of a smile. \u201cThank you, London,\u201d he said, taking to the podium. He thanked his parents, his team, and \u201cevery single Londoner for making the impossible, possible\u201d. The new mayor, aides said, had been determined to address head-on the tactics used against him. \u201cI\u2019m so proud,\u201d he said, \u201cthat London has today chosen hope over fear and unity over division.\u201d The politics of fear, he said, \u201cis simply not welcome in our city.\u201d Behind him, Goldsmith rocked ever so slightly on his heels. To Khan\u2019s rear, meanwhile, between Goldsmith and the Green candidate Sian Berry, the candidate for Britain First, Paul Golding, turned his back during the new mayor\u2019s speech, to audible gasps among the campaigners and journalists present. \u201cBritain has an extremist mayor!\u201d shouted a member of Golding\u2019s team.  Hope and unity, it turned out, have some way to go yet in Sadiq Khan\u2019s new London.",
