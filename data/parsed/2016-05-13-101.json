  "body": "Women at work on Friday were snapping pictures of their flat shoes in a show of solidarity with a receptionist sent home from her temp job after she did not wear high heels. The Twitter trend was initiated by the Fawcett Society following a backlash against sexist dress codes imposed by some employers.  Politicians including Labour MP Stella Creasy and Women\u2019s Equality party founder Catherine Mayer posted on Twitter as part of the feminist group\u2019s #FawcettFlatsFriday campaign.    #FawcettflatsFriday (every day it's flats for me) https://t.co/hXEBPIP50N pic.twitter.com/qeqLrBzZ3A\u2014 Catherine Mayer (@catherine_mayer) May 13, 2016      Oh goodness I am wearing flat shoes - well that OBVIOUSLY affects my ability to do my job... #fawcettflatsFriday pic.twitter.com/StUOUF9yw4\u2014 stellacreasy (@stellacreasy) May 13, 2016    Earlier this week, Nicola Thorp said she arrived on her first day at PwC in December in flat shoes but was then told she had to wear shoes with a 2in to 4in heel. Thorp, employed as a temporary worker by PwC\u2019s outsourced reception firm, Portico, said she was sent home without pay after refusing to go out and buy a pair of heels. The agency has since said it is reviewing its guidelines.  The 27-year-old from Hackney posted about her experience on Facebook and launched a petition calling for the law to be changed so companies can no longer force women to wear high heels to work, which has received more than 126,000 signatures.  PwC said it was not its policy to enforce a dress code with high heels, and several members of its staff took part in the #FawcettFlatsFriday campaign to prove they were always allowed to wear flat shoes.    Great to see the support for #fawcettflatsFriday coming from our people today! https://t.co/kkH55uk2Zf\u2014 PwC UK (@PwC_UK) May 13, 2016      Wearing my lovely flat shoes in @PwC_UK today, as I do many days of the week #fawcettflatsFriday ('scuse the carpet) pic.twitter.com/kVoiBtRFQl\u2014 Ellie Raven (@ellieraven_pwc) May 13, 2016      Wearing my flats on #fawcettflatsFriday, like I have done every day for the last 15years that I've worked @PwC_UK \ud83d\ude01 pic.twitter.com/cc9SGI1BMh\u2014 Stephanie Howel (@Nephatie) May 13, 2016    Mostly, though, the hashtag was used to make the point that women do not need to wear heels to do their jobs, whether it\u2019s saving lives, adding up accounts, or writing about internet memes.    Might find it tricky producing information for young cancer patients in these today! #fawcettflatsfriday #sperrys pic.twitter.com/wbKCpNZtQc\u2014 Steph Dale (@st3phal) May 13, 2016      #fawcettflatsFriday at the Chancery Bar.
