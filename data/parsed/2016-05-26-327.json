  "body": "Terence. You know Terence. He\u2019s the guy who sped up your commute and probably contributed to that RSI in your index finger. He\u2019s also this season\u2019s eyebrow inspiration. While he\u2019s not glaringly up there with Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse, he\u2019s worth thinking about given The Angry Birds Movie is out and mega brows are in. \u201cBrows have been huge for a while now,\u201d explains beauty writer Anita Bhagwandas, but, \u201cit\u2019s not just about Delevingne. Culturally, they represent a divide between that very arched, defined Kardashian-esque look where brows are groomed to perfection \u2013 and the more 90s-inspired tribe that focuses on a more natural, bare-faced beauty aesthetic.\u201d     Kristen Stewart at Cannes. Photograph: Anthony Harvey/FilmMagic    For evidence, look back at the past week. Take Kristen Stewart at Cannes last week. It was her festival, really, given her 80% commitment to glam (head-to-toe Chanel), cleverly muted with heavy kohl, bold roots and giant brows. Ditto Amal Clooney who stayed very kempt, as per. Or Kim Kardashian at the Vogue festival last weekend who has, apparently, gone a little more natural \u2013 save the brows, which remained like thick, manicured icing on her uncontoured baked (yes, that\u2019s a real beauty term) face. It\u2019s a bit brave, but if you dye your hair, go monochrome \u2013 comically dark brows with bleached hair. Somewhere between Daenerys Targaryen and The Face.

This season colours should pop, and eyebrows should stand out at 50 paces, or with a paparazzi lens. Unfortunately for the over-pluckers, this could be pie-in-the-sky thinking. Still, if you have tiny brows or sparse ones, Illamasqua\u2019s new Brow Build is \u201cvery good\u201d, according to Bhagwandas. \u201cIt has tiny hairs in it to bulk your brows up. Anastasia\u2019s Dipbrow is still the best brow shaping pomade ever,\u201d she adds. \u201cBenefit has tonnes of ace brow products. And I also love the Arch Brow Sculpting Pencil from Hourglass \u2013 it gives great angles for thick or thin brows.\u201d",
