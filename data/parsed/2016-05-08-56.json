Related: Peston on Sunday review: a bleeding-edged blade cuts old-school ties    Despite his much hyped Nicky Clarke haircut \u2013 he had been talking about little else on Twitter in the run-up to his debut \u2013 Peston was determined to keep his show as professionally amateur as possible. His was to be a programme where the rough edges were very much kept on view. Worried that not all his audience would have heard his opening supposedly off the cuff remark, Peston looked straight to camera and said: \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering, I am bleeding nervous.\u201d No one was wondering. Peston has a voice that incites anxiety in his audience, if not himself, at the best of times \u2013 is he actually ever going to get to the end of a sentence? \u2013 and on Sunday morning there was an added breathless quality to his unique vocal mix of strangulation and elongation. It looked like only a matter of time before he started hyper-ventilating on set. \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve got for you this week,\u201d he continued. \u201cAn interview with George Osborne, an interview with Louis Theroux \u2013 \u2018My son says he looks just like me,\u201d he added narcissistically \u2013 book club with Suzanne O\u2019Sullivan, Alastair Campbell and Esther McVey, our two political therapists \u2013 pushing it a bit as neither is noted for their empathy \u2013 and our political editor Allegra Stratton examining the issues of the day on social media.\u201d Peston just about managed to get all that out in a single agonising breath. The exhaustion and CBeebies atmosphere was contagious. After a brief round up of the news featuring a photo of Nicky Morgan looking like a dead ringer for a Piero della Francesca Madonna, Stratton started drawing random circles on a screen that Peston insisted on calling Screeny while McVey managed to call Zac Goldsmith\u2019s sister Gemma. It all felt a bit amateur hour which suited George Osborne just fine and he began his interview as if he was on a mutant hybrid of the Michael Parkinson show and Blue Peter. \u201cI think it\u2019s all going jolly well so far,\u201d he said kindly, while all around him could only see a car crash, before being allowed free rein to give dire warnings about how leaving the EU was going to be absolutely CATASTROPHIC and result in falling house prices. Then came the first ad break and suddenly the whole show began to \u2013 if not make sense \u2013 at least click into gear. It was Stratton and Screeny that initially came to the rescue with a tweet from the economist Jonathan Portes saying the chancellor was talking nonsense about house prices. Osborne was visibly taken aback by this and began to bluster; Peston went for the jugular. \u201cIsn\u2019t it true you\u2019ve made a bit of a mess with boom and bust economics, your government is now left to do one U-turn after another, the prime minister is more interested in not splitting the Tory party than winning the referendum and you just want his job?\u201d he said, contorting his vowels randomly while forcing the chancellor into bizarre contortions of his own. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed in playing safe,\u201d said Osborne. Hardly the most comforting words a country will ever hear from the man in charge of its finances. George might just have blown his chances of taking over from David Cameron there and then. Sensing his words might come back to bite him, Osborne tried to rescue the situation but could only dig himself in deeper by resorting to platitudes. By the end he couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the Peston\u2019s playpen. Peston & Screeny 1, Osborne O. Everything thereafter was bound to be a disappointment. The Louis Theroux interview went nowhere and the book club felt like it was filling time. \u201cWe will only be doing the book club every week or so,\u201d said Peston, sensing his show had peaked rather too early. The last laugh, though, went to Screeny, who will surely be pushing for the best dressing room next week, as various tweets pointed out Osborne had nicked a gag off Barack Obama. \u201cWe leave you with the result of our online poll. Fifty-five per cent of you seem to think that the government doing a U-turn is a sign of strength,\u201d Peston drawled incredulously as he stared at the results on Screeny. Some people in Tory central office must have been working overtime.",
