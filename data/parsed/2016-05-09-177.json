  "body": "Most former international development secretaries will admit privately that there are times when NGOs can be frustrating. But I developed a great respect for people who are willing to go out on a wet Thursday and campaign for what they believe in. I developed a great respect and affection for NGOs everywhere, but above all in Britain where our NGOs are world leaders.   Related: The missing development trillions: welcome to the debate    When I first came to the Department for International Development (DfID), there was certainly a resistance from NGOs to working more with the private sector. But it was very clear that this relationship needed to function properly if we were going to achieve what we wanted to achieve. I think that they were resistant, but there was also an intellectual curiosity about what we Tories were banging on about. Actually, in the end, I think we learned from each other. In the years since then, as we\u2019ve moved from the millennium development goals (MDGs) to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), there has been a huge shift in the relationship; there is far more trust. The private sector better understands the sensitivities of NGOs, and NGOs increasingly realise that the private sector is not necessarily the enemy of development. Obviously we want the private sector to be at its best. Where it is exploitative or where it is transferring profits to lesser taxed areas away from the areas in poor countries where those profits are earned, then it\u2019s quite right that NGOs should speak out. But this must take place in a framework where the private sector is seen as the engine of development, and not the enemy of it.  After all, we are now working towards the SDGs. We live in a world where there are colossal and obscene discrepancies of opportunity and wealth. The fact that so many of our fellow citizens live lives that are beset by danger in conflicts, and are dirt poor, these are things that should not only strike at our moral conscience, they are also things that make us unsafe. The world is unsafe because of the dysfunctionality and conflict that these gales of conflict and misery create. And so pursuing the SDGs is incredibly important in our national self-interest, as well as on moral grounds because it is the right thing to do. NGOs, the public sector and the private sector all have crucial roles to play in making the SDGs work. The greatest requirement when it comes to these is to show funders \u2013 whether they be taxpayers, philanthropists or charities \u2013 that the development work being done is effective, that it\u2019s delivering results, that when taxpayers deliver a dollar they\u2019re getting a hundred cents in return, and that should be right at the top of the list of priorities. Monitoring the SDGs, making sure the work is effective, is a critical part of the role NGOs will have to play.  When you look at how people lift themselves out of poverty it\u2019s by being economically active, and having a job, by giving women opportunities to work, by giving women the opportunity to decide for themselves about having children, and by educating children, particularly girls. For example, the world has had a pretty lackadaisical response to the millions of refugees who are on the move from Syria, but one thing we could do is try to make sure that they get an education. The reality is that two million of them are not getting an education, they are either in camps or they are in communities that are just overrun. But promoting economic activity and trying to help people get a job and train them and educate \u2013 these are all things on which the private sector and the state sector should be working hand in glove.    Related: The missing development trillions: where will they come from?    The role of the private sector must not only be putting its shoulder behind the SDGs. It is also crucial that it work hand-in-hand with the state sector, multilateral investment and philanthropists to promote economic development, employment and wellbeing. A real partnership between all these different groups has the capacity to really drive forward the aspirations of the SDGs.
