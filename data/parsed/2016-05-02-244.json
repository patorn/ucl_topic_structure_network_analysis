  "body": "It feels a bit like cheating, but in the interests of full disclosure, I\u2019m writing this before the weekend. On Saturday, I\u2019m off to Japan \u2013 for a holiday and to do the Wings for Life World Run. That being so, I\u2019m tempted to invent a fantasy weekend of running: 5k PB at parkrun on Saturday, 10km PB on Sunday, recovery run Sunday evening sound good? Oh, OK then, I\u2019ll be squeezing in a quick track session on Saturday morning before sitting on a plane for 12 hours and trying not to go out of my mind with boredom. Instead, then, a brief explainer of the Wings for Life run, which doesn\u2019t seem very well known, but which I cannot recommend highly enough. The basic principle is that everyone starts at the same time at the locations around the world, regardless of time zone. A catcher car starts half an hour later, and very gradually speeds up. You are \u201cout\u201d when the car passes you. The result is that, unlike in most races, the fastest people run the longest. When you are \u201ccaught\u201d you head back to HQ to watch the action unfold on a big screen. It\u2019s unlike any other race I\u2019ve done, and the fact that the Japanese edition takes place in the dark in, for me, totally unfamiliar terrain, should make it even more surreal than my experience last year. Full report to follow next Monday. But how was your weekend of running? As always, share your tips, PB glory, injury woes and general running questions below the line. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be a bit hit and miss there myself, but I\u2019ll try to drop in when I can. (And if that makes it sound like I think I am indispensable, I know that\u2019s far from the truth!) So, over to you. Take it away, folks ...",
