  "body": "\u2022 A travel article (Mi casa es tu casa, 30 April), page 9 said the lifting of the US trade embargo against Cuba had seen hotels move into the country for the first time since 1959. Restrictions on trade, financial transactions and travel have been eased recently but the\u00a0embargo has not been lifted. \u2022 Eagle-eyed readers spotted that some pawprints were incorrectly identified in the answers to a Nature quiz in last Saturday\u2019s Wild supplement (page 15).

We identified that of a badger with a deer and vice versa. \u2022 An exhibition of photographs at the Ben Uri gallery in London which was included in the listings in the Guide last Saturday (page 24) has not yet opened. The exhibition, Unseen: London, Paris, New York, 1930s-60s, runs from 20 May until 29 August.",
