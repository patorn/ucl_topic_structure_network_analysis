Launching a bus tour of the UK, the leader of Labour\u2019s in campaign said it was the most important political decision of his lifetime and his party would \u201cremorselessly\u201d throw itself into the campaign now the May elections are over.   Related: Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s Brexit intervention is ridiculous but effective | Jonathan Freedland    Johnson said those campaigning for Brexit without anything good to say about the EU were the extremists in the debate, demonstrating a mentality that is \u201cnot rational and not balanced\u201d.  Johnson is taking part in the tour of more than 100 campaign stops alongside Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader. \u201cEvery sinew, every muscle will be stretched, every piece of energy, every resource in the Labour party will be put into this campaign to get a remain vote,\u201d Johnson said. Corbyn told activists he was overwhelmingly in favour of staying in, primarily to protect the environment and workers\u2019 rights. But the Labour leader said his past criticisms of the EU still stood and he would push for further reform. \u201cWe face enormous challenges of climate change, cybercrime, the power of global corporations to try and evade taxes. We need to have a strong message that we can stand up to defend workers\u2019 rights and deal with the huge challenges of global refugee movements and protect the freedom of people in Britain to live, work and retire abroad,\u201d he said. As they launched the bus in a yard on the Southbank in London, workers on a next door construction site heckled them with shouts of \u201cout\u201d and \u201cvote leave\u201d.

Asked if he had any worries that Corbyn\u2019s speeches in favour of the EU lack passion, he said they were a \u201cvalid way of campaigning\u201d and the Labour leader was convincing because he had been on a personal journey from eurosceptic to where he was now. He went on to say any money saved from leaving the EU was a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d in terms of the total national income and spending on the NHS. In relation to campaigners for Brexit, Johnson added: \u201cI think it is an extreme view that there is nothing good about the EU at all \u2026 When they can\u2019t find anything good at all that is extreme. That suggests a certain mentality that is not rational and not balanced.\u201d He also defended David Cameron\u2019s argument that leaving the EU could increase the risk of war, saying the prime minister\u2019s position \u201cdoes mean something\u201d. Responding to the comments, Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, said the remain campaign should stop \u201cthrowing threats and ridiculous terms around because it demeans them and it demeans debate\u201d.",
