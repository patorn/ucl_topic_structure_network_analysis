  "body": "Iceland is poised to curb an Airbnb explosion as it tries to balance record tourist numbers with the protection of its spectacular unspoilt landscape and traditional lifestyle. Proposed legislation, which could become law this week, seeks to restrict the number of days residents can offer Airbnb rentals in their properties to 90 days a year before they must pay business tax.  The move comes as the island\u2019s 335,000-strong population is set to welcome 1.6 million visitors this year \u2013 a 29% increase on last year \u2013 drawn by the glaciers, fjords, lava fields, hot springs, hiking trails and midnight sun.

Tourism has been the salvation of the North Atlantic island where the economy, built on fishing, was seriously damaged after the catastrophic collapse of its banking industry in the 2008 global recession.  Now, as the building of hotels struggles to keep pace with tourism growth, many Icelanders are cashing in through Airbnb and other short-term rental websites, especially in central Reykjav\u00edk, where the majority of tourists stay.  One report estimates a 124% increase in Airbnb rentals in one year, with more than 100 flats available on the capital\u2019s main street alone. The result has been a dramatic increase in house prices in central Reykjav\u00edk, and a paucity of long-term rentals.

One thousand new hotel rooms were needed this year, yet only 300 were planned, he said.     Accommodation in Iceland for rent on Airbnb.

But he cautioned against \u201cfollowing the growth at that pace\u201d.  Tourism now accounts for 34% of Iceland\u2019s export revenues, compared with 18% in 2010. As such, Hreinsson said, the economy would be hit more heavily now by a setback such as a volcanic eruption, than i9t was after the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. In April, the supreme court ruled that anyone in an apartment block needed permission from other residents before renting their apartment through Airbnb. Two municipal councils, Kirkjub\u00e6jarklaustur and V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal, have already implemented measures to restrict short-term tourist accommodation. The latter reportedly has rooms for 1,300 guests, but a population of just 540. The new law, which is in the final stages of review, would apply across Iceland. \u00c1shildur Bragad\u00f3ttir, the director of Visit Reykjav\u00edk, said she was quite confident it would be passed \u201cbecause everyone sees that something needs to change. We don\u2019t want downtown Reykjav\u00edk to be tourists only, with no locals\u201d.      The summit ridge of Skaftafell, South Iceland.

But, she said, \u201cwe need to monitor [it] very closely and take care that we don\u2019t, for example, create a city centre devoid of citizens\u201d. She said the legislation was not an attempt to ban Airbnb, because many tourists preferred that experience to hotels, but to establish controls and \u201cto give it a place within the [tourism] sector where it has to adhere to rules\u201d.

There have been accusations of tourists urinating and defecating on the graves of famous Icelandic poets, and driving rental cars off-road over fragile protected sites. Gunnar \u00fe\u00f3r J\u00f3hannesson, an associate professor in geography and tourism at the University of Iceland, said the lack of infrastructure was a challenge. With Keflav\u00edk as its one gateway airport, Iceland was \u201cstruggling to distribute our tourists around the island\u201d. Some hotspots were under pressure in the high season, and there were concerns that \u201cthe city centre is being hollowed out, becoming sort of Disneyfied\u201d. A cap on tourist numbers on the most popular hiking trails, such as the Laugavegur, might be an option, he said, but a cap would not work for towns or the city. \u201cWe are not there yet and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to go.\u201d The government is looking at introducing direct international flights to Egilssta\u00f0ir in the east and Akureyri in the north, which, said Atladott\u00edr, would help even out visitor numbers around the country throughout the year, and make less-visited areas of the island more accessible, particularly during winter months. Platforms, barriers and trails could help increase the number of visitors to key sites and protect them at the same time, Johannesson said.     Northern lights in Iceland. Photograph: Daniele Boffelli    \u201cWe have to take care in not going too fast, and we have to have the time and space to gather the information and data we need to make the best decision we can.  \u201cIt is easy to paint a rather bleak picture of what is happening, because it happened so fast, that Iceland is getting swamped in tourists. But it is not necessarily like that. It is a huge challenge, and in all fairness, the government is trying now and taking a firm grip on things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is growing pains.\u201d",
