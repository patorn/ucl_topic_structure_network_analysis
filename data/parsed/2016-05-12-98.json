  "body": "In a year when the Samuel Johnson prize (now the Baillie Gifford prize for non-fiction) has dumped Samuel Johnson and the Man Booker International prize has reinvented itself as an annual award for books (instead of a biennial one for authors), the so-called \u201cBaftas of the book trade\u201d has been transformed too. Formerly the Bookseller industry awards, the prizegiving was relaunched on Monday as the British Book Industry awards; a change that involves taking part of the name of the National/British book awards, aka the Nibbies \u2013 last held in 2014, and currently comatose \u2013 and moving on to its turf by adding five prizes for 2015\u2019s top titles to the existing ones for retailers and publishers. The nib symbol that gave the Nibbies its name seemed to have been sneakily appropriated too in the logo for the as yet acronym-lacking ceremony (the Bribbies? The Bribos?). The new awards came last, which could be seen as a laudable assertion that books matter most \u2013 they were top of the bill, with the unveiling of the overall book of the year as the long evening\u2019s climax \u2013 but also meant that (as prizes Nos 20-24) they were announced when the audience, and perhaps host Mariella Frostrup, were at their most impatient for the BBIAs to be over so they could hit the bar or go home. Before them came trophies for booksellers and individual publishers or agents, the latter group notable for all being won by women, who often emerged from all-female or female-dominated shortlists: Pavilion\u2019s Tina Persaud, nurturer of colouring-book queen Millie Marotta (editor of the year); Macmillan\u2019s Michele Young (rights professional); David Higham\u2019s Lizzy Kremer, whose authors include Paula Hawkins (agent); and Doubleday\u2019s Alison Barrow, PR for Hawkins\u2019s The Girl on the Train (publicity campaign). After half-time and supper, the gongs for publishers gave the impression that the Dodo\u2019s decree (\u201call must have prizes\u201d) in Alice in Wonderland had guided the judges, as every giant conglomerate was catered for \u2013 Macmillan\u2019s Picador took best imprint, Hachette\u2019s Hodder best educational publisher, HarperCollins best children\u2019s list and PRH\u2019s Transworld publisher of the year. Indy success was hence confined to the victory of Oneworld, home to Marlon James, in the independent publisher division where they were opposing each other. Seemingly mimicking the Costas in selecting category winners that then compete for an overall prize, the climactic book awards displayed a similar imbalance \u2013 three fiction prizes and only one for non-fiction, a slight improvement on the Costas\u2019 4:1 \u2013 and consequently an equally unsatisfactory non-fiction lineup; though the problem was that it was too miscellaneous rather than (like the Costas\u2019 biography-only category) too narrow, forcing Mary Beard\u2019s SPQR to bizarrely battle such foes as a Ladybird humour title and the cookbook Deliciously Ella.   Related: Andrew Michael Hurley: 'There is no place more terrifying than your own mind'    To Frostrup\u2019s delight, the victor was Lars Mytting\u2019s surprise Christmas hit Norwegian Wood, which no less surreally joined the fiction (Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s A Little Life), debut fiction (Andrew Michael Hurley\u2019s The Loney) and children\u2019s (David Solomons\u2019s My Brother Is a Superhero) winners on the best-of-the-best shortlist. It might be viewed as inauspicious that these inaugural awards\u2019 supreme prize went to a book that wasn\u2019t actually eligible, The Loney having been originally published in 2014 (by Tartarus) before John Murray acquired it. After four hours of applauding and guzzling, however, most BBIA banqueteers had either forgotten that the 2015 Costa judges (who also made it their debut novel winner) had been forced to explicitly bend their rules to accommodate Hurley\u2019s book, or if they could remember were too weary to care.",
