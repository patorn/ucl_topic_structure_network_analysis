  "body": "I agree wholeheartedly with Gary Younge (Racism is a system of oppression, not a series of bloopers, 4\u00a0May) about the way minor indiscretions are magnified out of all proportion. Down the years we have faced some real racists: Mosley, the National Front, the BNP and other fringe groups and elements within the Conservative party and Ukip. Many of us have supported organisations to defeat them: the Anti-Nazi League, Rock Against Racism and Hope Not Hate. Yes, correct people when they say something that appears racist, but reserve our real opposition for more serious opponents.Martin WrightSale \u2022 Gary Younge may have inadvertently underwritten the credibility of apologies \u201cfor any offence\u00a0caused\u201d (as offered by Gerry Adams). There is a hidden ambiguity in the use of the word \u201cany\u201d, which implies that in the opinion of the\u00a0speaker people were not justified in taking offence. Even in an era of professional offence-takers, the better phrase is: \u201cI\u00a0apologise to anyone I\u00a0have offended.\u201dJohn HorganFormer press ombudsman for Ireland, Dublin \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
