  "body": "Louis van Gaal arrived at Manchester United as the \u201cIron Tulip\u201d and departs as the \u201cMuddled Thinker\u201d. The confusion that swirled around his tactics, team selection and man-management is why Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is set to take over  and it was again evident in the XI the Dutchman sent out for the FA Cup final.   Related: Louis van Gaal says \u2018it\u2019s over\u2019 as his Manchester United reign is set to end    One of Van Gaal\u2019s persistent moans this season has been the lack of pacy wingers. Step forward, then, Jesse Lingard, who is precisely this and who before Saturday\u2019s 2-1 victory against Crystal Palace had made 39 appearances in a breakthrough year. He was in the starting lineup that beat Bournemouth 3-1 on Tuesday night at Old Trafford but despite Van Gaal\u2019s pointing to the need for speed along the flanks, Lingard was dropped against Crystal Palace. A head-scratcher \u2013 but Van Gaal has made this a prime occupation for those who have regularly watched his United these past two seasons. Attempting to solve the puzzle of what the former Holland manager was up to whenever his players kicked off became the side-game to the match. After Lingard\u2019s relegation to the bench the next conundrum was in the United engine room. Van Gaal sent out a team to beat Palace that again had Wayne Rooney in a deep-lying midfield position. The issue is not the England captain\u2019s ability to operate there \u2013 he can \u2013 but in how the Dutchman lined up the rest of his men. Michael Carrick operated alongside Rooney, as did Marouane Fellaini, these last two perhaps told by the manager to rove forward when they could. The lack of clarity over their roles arises because to observe United was to see them too often clogged up across midfield. With Rooney and Fellaini playing a game of should I stay or should I go, United had a man too many \u2013 and this slowed them. The last thing this Van Gaal side requires is further hindrance to any attacking with zest. The 64-year-old\u2019s insistence that passing into submission is the way forward has proved only a sideways move. So United were even stodgier than usual \u2013 some feat \u2013 and would advance to territory near Palace\u2019s area and no further. It meant that at half-time they dominated but were held at 0-0. It meant they were vulnerable to the kind of smash-and-grab goal they have too often suffered under Van Gaal. On 78 minutes it occurred. Palace had been subdued, then up popped Jason Puncheon with a volley that beat David de Gea from close in on an angle. Alan Pardew\u2019s side were in dreamland and Van Gaal\u2019s were in the nightmare of being responsible for United\u2019s third consecutive FA Cup final loss, to follow 2007 and 2005. Rooney, however, was about to step up to illustrate he can still be United\u2019s X-factor. His mazy run from near the centre circle to the right edge of Palace\u2019s area acted as a magnet, pulling them out of shape. The cross Rooney sent over as his weight took him in the opposite direction impressed, as did the way it dropped on to Fellaini, whose chest-down was finished by a grateful Juan Mata. Cue a mightily relieved United. This was nine minutes from the end and then in extra-time Chris Smalling was dismissed for a second yellow card on 105 minutes. By the 110th United were ahead. Lingard had eventually been sent on by Van Gaal, just before the 90-minute mark. Now he showed his class and what United had been missing, letting fly with a rocket of a volley that gave Wayne Hennessey no chance in the Palace goal. Of his Boy\u2019s Own moment, Lingard said: \u201cIt was a massive feeling. To win it is great, and ending the season on a high with my family and friends watching in the crowd. It fell nicely for me to hit; I knew I had to catch it right and luckily I did.\u201d United deserved the victory and glory of a 12th FA Cup triumph that puts them alongside Arsenal as the competition\u2019s most successful club. It was a win of bloody-mindedness \u2013 as if the players wanted to prevail despite, and not because of, Van Gaal. Lingard said: \u201cIt\u2019s the United way \u2013 we showed great team spirit. We had the older lads in midfield and youth up front to guide us through.\u201d   Related: FA Cup win on its own was never enough to save Louis van Gaal | Paul Wilson    Van Gaal, who on Sunday indicated that his time at United was \u201cover\u201d, at least ended two muddled years as a winner. Being the first man to secure a trophy in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, after three years, is no small achievement. Van Gaal outlined what this means to him. \u201cA lot, because that was my aim. My aim was the experience of English football, English culture and to bring a title to Manchester United in spite of the transition that we have to make. I\u2019m very happy because I\u2019ve done it [won the Cup] in four countries and I don\u2019t think many other managers can say this. It feels unbelievable.\u201d Of Lingard\u2019s winner, he added: \u201cIt was a fantastic goal and a special moment. You don\u2019t see them too much. I had a lucky hand, I believe.\u201d Luck is a red herring. Too often Van Gaal\u2019s United have not been good enough. Man of the match Jesse Lingard (Manchester United)",
