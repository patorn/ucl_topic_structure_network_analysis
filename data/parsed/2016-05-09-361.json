On Monday domestic media said at least 41 people were missing after a torrent of boulders and mud tore through the construction site of a hydroelectric dam in Fujian province the previous morning. About 100,000 cubic meters of debris engulfed the riverside camp in Fujian\u2019s Tainan county at about 5am on Sunday, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency. \u201cWe were still asleep when the mountains began to jolt very strongly and before we know it, sand and mud are flowing into our room,\u201d one survivor, Deng Chunwu, told the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s been raining all the time over the past couple of days and I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. But the rain last night was more fierce than ever,\u201d added Deng, who reportedly dodged death by hiding under a pole.

Sniffer dogs are working alongside over 600 rescuers to help detect any signs of life from the debris. Dozens of excavators are digging through the pile,\u201dtheir report said. Large swaths of eastern and southern China have been hit by heavy rainstorms in recent days and the situation is expected to get far worse.  Last month China warned that the area along the Yangtze River was this year likely to experience its worst flooding since the late 1990s when up to 4,000 people died.  Authorities have blamed an unusually strong El Nino weather pattern for the likelihood of similarly devastating floods in 2016.",
