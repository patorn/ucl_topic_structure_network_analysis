People took to the streets on Wednesday accusing the authorities of corruption and violence linked to plans to redevelop a popular area of Belgrade. The rally was organised by the Ne Davimo Beograd (Don\u2019t Drown Belgrade) movement, which opposes a \u20ac2.7bn deal with an Abu Dhabi-based developer to transform part of Belgrade into an upscale housing and shopping complex. Demonstrators took aim in particular at an incident on 24 April in the arts and nightlife district of Savamala, where several buildings were demolished in the night by mysterious masked men.  Wearing balaclavas and driving vehicles without number plates, the men allegedly bound onlookers and took their mobile phones while bulldozers razed the buildings, according to local media reports. One of the witnesses to the demolitions, Slobodan Tanaskovic, later died in hospital. Serbian ex-president Boris Tadic, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party, called for an urgent probe into the death of the 58-year-old. The Beta news agency said the cause of death had not been disclosed. Protesters called for the resignation of various police, government and city officials over the demolitions, which cleared part of the way for the Belgrade Waterfront redevelopment. \u201cIt is unacceptable that a month after the incident we don\u2019t know who is responsible for violence against citizens. Someone should be held accountable,\u201d said local journalist Vesna Milisavljevic, 45, at the rally. The rally appeared to be attended by 5,000 or more people. Demonstrators shouted \u201cVucic thief!\u201d referring to the prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic. Cries of \u201cThis is our town!\u201d and \u201cResignations!\u201d rang out. Vucic, who unveiled the waterfront project in 2014, has branded the masked men \u201cidiots\u201d for their behaviour but said the buildings had been scheduled for demolition. They should have been razed during the day, Vucic told reporters earlier this month, adding that he would have attended the demolition \u201cwith pleasure\u201d. The agreement signed with developer Eagle Hills aims to turn parts of Savamala and surrounding areas into nearly two million square metres of malls, offices and apartment blocks. The centrepiece of the project is a 200-metre tall Dubai-style tower. Backers of the project say it will regenerate a rundown area, while critics allege a lack of transparency and public consultation, fearing the development will be of little benefit to most Serbian citizens.",
