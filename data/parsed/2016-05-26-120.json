  "body": "Zinedine Zidane was there; Zinedine Zidane is always there. When Real Madrid won their ninth European Cup he scored the volley that took them there, foot up somewhere near his ear. When they won their 10th European Cup he was the quickest down the touchline at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz, the first to reach the corner and leap on Gareth Bale after the Welshman had scored the winning goal. And when they walk out of the dressing room at San Siro on Saturday night, seeking their 11th European Cup, against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, he will embrace them all one by one and then he will take up his position on the touchline.   Related: Will Cristiano Ronaldo break his own scoring record against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid?    This is Zidane\u2019s third European Cup final with Real, each of them reached at the end of his first season in his post, each of them won: first as a player, then assistant manager and now as manager. He admits that he has a \u201cstar\u201d somewhere; he has not even been in the job, his first senior post, for five months and here he is already, preparing for the game that, he says, \u201ceveryone wants to play\u201d. Then he adds, with a smile: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to play it.\u201d He would like to but managing suits him too. Former team-mates may not have imagined as much but he always thought it might. \u201cThere\u2019s pressure but I like that,\u201d Zidane says, and he really does seem to. For all the talk of elegance and effortlessness, above all he was and is a competitor; he rebelled against his comfortable existence as a retiree, preferring to do something real. Others were not so sure but he was determined. Yet there is a calmness to him too, coolly stepping past obstacles, a sense of enjoyment. \u201cI will approach this with patience, tranquillity and determination,\u201d the 43-year-old says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play a final: everyone who likes football wants to have the feeling of living a final with their team.\u201d Facing him will be Diego Simeone, a coach who Zidane insists \u201chas everything\u201d. And what does Zidane have? \u201cA lot to learn,\u201d the Frenchman says. \u201cBut the desire I have to learn is huge, so I will improve, for sure.\u201d Ask his Real Madrid players and they all say the same thing: he is pretty good already. \u201cWe needed Zidane like rain in May,\u201d Isco says. \u201cHe has been the key; he was an injection of morale.\u201dReal Madrid\u2019s players, Isco admits, did not relate to Rafael Ben\u00edtez; Zidane could hardly be more different. Nor could their attitude towards him have been. The sarcastic nickname they handed their former manager was \u201cThe No10\u201d, a man who never played the game but deigned to tell them how to do so. Now they have a real No10, one of the best there has been, a former player and former assistant manager too, who played with Sergio Ramos and knows the squad from working with the popular Carlo Ancelotti and who completed his apprenticeship with the B team. Ramos, the captain, admitted there was little \u201cempathy\u201d or \u201caffinity\u201d with Ben\u00edtez. With Zidane there is. \u201cWe feel his affection, we feel valued,\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo says. \u201cHe deserves to continue,\u201d Dani Carvajal adds. On this issue, at least, the verdict from the squad is unanimous. The connection is clear. There has been no tactical revolution. There have been few real changes and those there have been are ones that Ben\u00edtez too embraced or wanted to: Carlos Casemiro plays now and James Rodr\u00edguez does not, for a start. Far from talking about fantasy, Zidane\u2019s greatest obsession in his first two months was physical work and the message he most drives home to his players is that they must all take defensive responsibility. But he wears those demands lightly and the atmosphere has changed entirely. There is now clear freedom and complicity. \u201cI am not at all surprised that he has been a success,\u201d Marcelo says. \u201cI knew he would do a great job. He has come in calmly, quietly, with humility, without treading on anyone\u2019s toes, without thinking he is above anyone.\u201d Ronaldo adds: \u201cAlthough he is still in a process of adaptation, things have flowed very quickly and I would like him to continue.\u201d Real have won their last 12 league games. Zidane\u2019s career as a coach has begun with 53 points from 20 matches, better than any other manager at the Bernab\u00e9u. Now they have the Champions League final. \u201cI know the feelings that a player has [for a game like this],\u201d Zidane says. And that is the point \u2013 or part of it, at least. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted with him,\u201d Ramos says. \u201cIf you have been a footballer, you have a way doing things, a view of the game, that\u2019s different. So maybe that is why, although he has only been here for a short time, it feels like he has been a manager for 30 years. He learnt a lot from [Carlo] Ancelotti; he has a lot of things about him that Carletto had, so I have only good things to say about him. I would renew him now, no matter what. \u201cAlthough Zidane has not been here for long we think he is a great coach and I think he has an enormous future ahead of him.\u201d First he has the Champions League final \u2013 another one. It is only two months since Real Madrid lost 1-0 to Atl\u00e9tico and Zidane conceded the league was lost, but things feel different now. So what has changed in two months for them now to be preparing for a European Cup final, confident and calm? \u201cWe have worked well; we\u2019re in a good moment. It\u2019s a lovely game to play ... and well, that\u2019s all,\u201d Zidane says. Then he smiles and, as if it has just dawned on him once more, adds with a slight shake of the head: \u201cTwo months ...\u201d",
