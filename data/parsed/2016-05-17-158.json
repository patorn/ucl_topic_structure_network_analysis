Ah, of course. A movie. Not a man. Civantos, 31, is the star of new Spanish prison series Locked Up \u2013 set to hit British screens today as part of the Channel 4 foreign TV bonanza Walter Presents. The show has been a smash in Spain, attracting an average of 3.5 million viewers an episode and earning Civantos several best actress awards. Spanish fans enter competitions in their droves to win the uniforms worn in the show.     \u2018She\u2019s not proud to be a bad girl; she just has to do it\u2019 \u2026 Macarena (Maggie Civantos).    If the words \u201ctelevision\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s prison\u201d immediately make you think of Orange is the New Black, hold your high-security horses for just a second. Locked Up (known as Vis a Vis in Spain) is a thriller, a whodunnit and a howdidtheydoit, rather than a comedy. It follows the apparently innocent Macarena Ferreiro, played by Civantos, who is dubbed Snow White by inmates and tries to battle her way out of prison and back to a \u201cnormal\u201d life. Along the way, she encounters a scorpion-baiting psychopath called Zulema (played by the Spanish singer and actor Najwa Nimri), a textbook butch prison mother called Soledad \u201cSole\u201d N\u00fa\u00f1ez and the curly-haired Estefan\u00eda Kabila or \u201cRizos\u201d, who asks Macarena in the shower to be her girlfriend. And yes, while there are blond protagonists in both, Civantos is keen to point out that she and Taylor Schilling play quite different characters.

She has just finished filming the second series, for which she had slightly more time to prepare than the first: \u201cI got the part a week before we started shooting, so there wasn\u2019t time to go and talk to any prisoners,\u201d she says. \u201cI was very nervous.\u201d And the first scene she ever had to shoot? One in which the man playing her boss sticks his hand up her skirt in a business meeting.      Zulema the scorpion-baiting psychopath.    According to Civantos, Spain doesn\u2019t have a prison system like the one we see on screen. \u201cThere aren\u2019t private prisons, with uniforms and things,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a drama. But the women\u2019s feelings are the same; the violence is the same. My neighbour works in a juvenile detention centre and she says it\u2019s very similar.\u201d The violence is marked right from the start, as an inmate gets boiled alive in the laundry room. No wonder the creator, Alex Pina, says it has \u201cthe most sex and violence we\u2019ve ever seen on TV in Spain\u201d. \u201cMacarena has to change just to survive in jail; to survive the violence,\u201d explains Civantos, who says she is sceptical about prison as an institution. \u201cShe\u2019s not proud to be a bad girl; she just has to do it.\u201d  The actor is very proud to be involved in a show with so many prominent female characters. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a feminist, but I am tied to the idea of men and women being equal; being the same. So often, women on TV are subordinate \u2013 they\u2019re the friend or the supporting character. In this, you see real women: strong women, weak women, sweet women, violent women.\u201d     Locked Up has the \u2018the most sex and violence we\u2019ve ever seen on TV in Spain\u2019.    You also see a lot of women in bright yellow suits. Was Civantos thrilled about spending so much time dressed as a high-visibility banana? \u201cInitially I worried, because in Spain yellow is considered bad luck and I\u2019m very superstitious,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen Moli\u00e8re died he was wearing yellow; people think it\u2019s unlucky to wear it on stage, too. But now the series has been such a success, it\u2019s my favourite colour.\u201d  With the simmering sense of claustrophobia, the determined set of her jaw and the wardrobe of white vests, there is something of the Sigourney Weaver in Alien about Civantos\u2019 performance in Locked Up. \u201cMy mum says the same thing!\u201d she laughs. \u201cHonestly, she says it all the time. I\u2019m very proud \u2013 I love Sigourney Weaver.\u201d Would she like to get super ripped and run around with a massive gun on set? \u201cThat was my plan for the second series \u2026 well, to get stronger,\u201d says Civantos. \u201cBut it would have messed with the continuity. Maybe in the third series I can get muscles like Sigourney.\u201d \u2022 The first episode of Locked Up is on Channel 4 tonight at 10pm, then the whole series will be immediately available on Walter Presents on All 4.",
