I love to fly. But if I need to, I\u2019ll do everything, I\u2019ll go down this road.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s first female military pilot, Savchenko was elected to parliament and appointed to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe during nearly two years in captivity, and some have wondered if she will be the country\u2019s next leader.  She received a hero\u2019s welcome when she flew to Kiev on Wednesday after being pardoned by Vladimir Putin.  Savchenko\u2019s return was also a victory for the embattled president, Petro Poroshenko, who pledged to return Crimea and eastern Ukraine \u201cjust as we brought back Nadiya\u201d.           Who is Nadiya Savchenko?    Savchenko had been captured fighting against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in June 2014 and charged with complicity in the deaths of two Russian journalists who died in an artillery strike. A Russian court sentenced her to 22 years in prison in March after a trial that was condemned by western countries. Before her press conference, Savchenko took a dip in a fountain on Independence Square and sang the national anthem with well-wishers. She promised to form committees to free political prisoners and return occupied territories, as well as fight corruption in the Ukrainian army. She also defended her comrades in the Aidar battalion, which Amnesty International has accused of war crimes. \u201cYou sit on the couch and ask us how we fought. We fought the way we had to. Or you think that saints are fighting there?\u201d she said.

Two Russian special forces officers who were captured in eastern Ukraine and convicted of terrorism were flown to Moscow on Wednesday as part of the exchange. Despite her release, G7 leaders said on Thursday that sanctions against Russia could only be rolled back when it fulfilled peace plan commitments agreed in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. The Ukrainian embassy in Belarus said Savchenko could join the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine in Minsk, which includes representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the eastern Ukraine separatists and works for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.",
