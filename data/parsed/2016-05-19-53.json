The pair\u2019s unbroken stand of 88 in 21 overs took Alastair Cook\u2019s side to 171 for five by the time showers wiped out the evening session, having been put in by the tourists under cloudy skies and rocked by three wickets from the debutant Dasun Shanaka. \u201cIt\u2019s delicately poised at the moment and the first hour will shape the game,\u201d said Hales, who struck 12 fours in a watchful innings of 154 balls as he went past the 60 he made in Cape Town during his maiden series against South Africa over the winter.

The way Jonny counterattacked was brilliant. There was consistent swing most of the day, a bit of nibble and bounce so I had to rein myself in. I\u2019m pleased to get through it but it\u2019s just the start.\u201d On Bairstow, who was positively glowing in form on his home ground and successfully overturned an lbw decision on 40 off the bowling of the Sri Lanka captain, Angelo Mathews, Hales said: \u201cHe\u2019s been brilliant, hasn\u2019t he? \u201cHe naturally scores at a strike rate of 70 or 80 and on a pitch like that it was pretty tough but he made it seem like nothing. It shows how far he\u2019s come as a Test cricketer. He looks the real deal.\u201d Hales survived a difficult first hour after Mathews won the toss before Shanaka, in the space of eight balls, removed his opening partner, Cook, caught behind on 16 \u2013 20 runs short of 10,000 in Test cricket \u2013 and Nick Compton and Joe Root edging to the slips for successive ducks, to reduce England to 51 for three in the 23rd over. The right-arm medium pacer, playing his first cricket in England this summer, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great honour to get the wickets of Cook and Root. We are still in a good position. I\u2019m a batting all-rounder. I can swing the ball but mainly I\u2019m a batsman. \u201cI\u2019m delighted because it\u2019s my debut. There were suitable conditions for me and I\u2019m very happy. When the captain gave me the ball I was nervous. In two or three balls I got the rhythm. I saw video clips of the England batsmen and wanted to bowl the driving length.\u201d England\u2019s 57 for three at lunch became 83 for five in the 32nd over, with Hales losing the debutant James Vince, driving to slip on nine, and Ben Stokes duffing a clip to mid-on with 12 to his name.

Hales, who faced criticism after averaging 17 in South Africa, took off the first two weeks of the English summer in order to rest despite no guarantees over his place, but spoke of having made adjustments to his game outside off stump he believes can help him thrive at Test level. The 27-year-old said: \u201cWhen I decided to take the time off, they didn\u2019t give me any inkling [over my place]. When I came back to my practice it was a lot more intense and I had my ideas on what I wanted to improve. I feel I have come a long way. It\u2019s proved the right decision.\u201d Players on both sides wore black armbands as a mark of respect for the victims of the floods and landslides in Sri Lanka.",
