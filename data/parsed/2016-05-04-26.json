  "body": "There was a brave wave, a sad trudge off, and now for Vincent Kompany in the coming days surely more soul-searching as Manchester City\u2019s captain contemplates the 33rd injury in his eight years at the club. Manuel Pellegrini had stated before this Champions League semi-final second leg that City\u2019s best opportunity was to \u201cplay well in defence\u201d, then he watched dismayed as Kompany hobbled off 10 minutes in with what appeared to be a quad problem. This meant the leader of the rearguard \u2013 and the side \u2013 was again a helpless onlooker, and it now fell to Eliaquim Mangala to partner Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi at centre-back.   Related: Real Madrid 1-0  Manchester City (agg 1-0_: Champions League semi-final \u2013 as it happened    This was the pairing at the heart of a defence that shipped four goals in Sunday\u2019s defeat at Southampton. Mangala was one of three players from that unit dropped for this evening. Aleksandar Kolarov and Pablo Zabaleta also made way for Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Bacary Sagna at left- and right-back respectively, so as the Frenchman replaced Kompany the test was whether the disrupted defence would be able to repel Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u with the tie poised at 0-0. The first answer came around 10 minutes after Kompany was forced off, as Gareth Bale ran at Joe Hart from the right and conjured an opener that beat the City goalkeeper via a deflection that pinballed in off his right-hand post. At this juncture Real were running riot and Pellegrini\u2019s faith in Kompany as the back four\u2019s bedrock appeared a gamble that had misfired at the worst possible time. This reliance on the Belgian is a prime head-scratcher for the incoming Pep Guardiola. The Spaniard officially takes over on 1 July but he is already plotting how to take City on to the next level. After his Bayern Munich side were eliminated by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Tuesday\u2019s first semi-final, Guardiola will have watched this encounter and had his concerns over Kompany\u2019s robustness confirmed. Guardiola has to wonder if he can really afford to rely on a 30-year-old whose previous injuries have already cost him 18 weeks of this season, and which up to Wednesday night\u2019s sad end have allowed him to appear in only 21 of City\u2019s 57 matches. City have already spent \u00a374m in transfer fees alone trying to answer the Kompany question. This is the outlay for Mangala (\u00a342m) and Otamendi (\u00a332m) but the best to be said about either is each is a far better footballer when Kompany operates alongside them. City are determined to give Kompany one more year to finally rid himself of his injury plague. The reason is simple: the side are a tougher proposition when he is in it. Yet this \u201cwhen\u201d becomes more and more an \u201cif\u201d due to the physical problems that have denied the Belgian a serious run in the XI. The firm interest in signing Athletic Bilbao\u2019s Aymeric Laporte for a reported \u00a339.6m release-clause fee is an attempt to finally free them of the problem. The Frenchman is expected to be out until August due to a broken leg and dislocated ankle, however. On the one hand this shows how highly Laporte is thought of by Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain, the sporting director who signs off transfers. But on the other, given that any player who returns from serious injury can never be absolutely sure how he might recover, it seems yet another throw of the dice at centre-back when really what is needed is the acquisition of a banker of a performer. Yet given the manner of Kompany\u2019s early withdrawal City could be proud at half-time to still be within 45 minutes of the European Cup final. The scoreline remained 1-0 to Zinedine Zidane\u2019s team so the equation was the same as at the kick-off: a sole goal would take Pellegrini\u2019s side to the Milan showpiece this month due to the away goals rule. The concern was that every time Real went at the City backline holes would appear. Not 10 minutes had been played after the interval when Luka Modric found himself in, alone on goal, before Hart. The Croatian should have doubled his team\u2019s lead but fluffed the chance, and City\u2019s No1 did the rest. Earlier, Pellegrini had also said: \u201cIt is important to realise that it is not easy to get to a semi-final. First you must be in the top four in your league, which is not easy in England. Then it is very difficult to continue after the group stage, the round of 16, the quarter-final. So we must play and fight for every ball to win the game and take our chance to reach the final. \u201cWe will see if Yaya Tour\u00e9 is able to complete 90 minutes, but his experience in this game is very important.\u201d By the hour the anonymous Ivorian had been replaced by Raheem Sterling. And as the contest entered its final 15 minutes City still required a goal. Either from the kind of trickery the England forward can provide, or anywhere else. On returning from injury No32, a knee problem that kept him out between 15 March and 19 April, Kompany had spoken of \u201c14 comebacks\u201d. The idea there was to stress the positive. It is an admirable approach but he now faces another challenge of will and spirit. For Manchester City there is a more fundamental issue to contemplate: can Kompany really be the linchpin of the team in the new Guardiola era?",
