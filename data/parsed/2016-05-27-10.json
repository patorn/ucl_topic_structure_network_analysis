  "body": "Argentina\u2019s last military dictator, 88-year-old former general Reynaldo Bignone, was today sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in Operation Condor, under which an international death squad was set up by six South American military dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s. The plan allowed death squads from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay to cross into one another\u2019s territory to kidnap, torture and kill political opponents who had fled across the border. Most of the 105 cases of \u201cillegal arrest\u201d followed by death covered by the trial involved foreign nationals \u2013 45 Uruguayans, 22 Chileans, 13 Paraguayans and11 Bolivians \u2013 killed while living in exile in Argentina.

After their arrest, the victims were made to \u201cdisappear\u201d, usually by being cremated, or thrown drugged but still alive from military planes into the Atlantic Ocean.

Bignone, who ruled Argentina in 1982-1983 in the wake of the Falklands war, was found guilty of being part of an illicit association, kidnapping and abusing his powers in the forced disappearance of more than 100 people. The former general is already serving life sentences for multiple human rights violations during the 1976-1983 dictatorship. Another high-ranking former general, Santiago Riveros, with jurisdiction over Buenos Aires and various clandestine detention centres, was sentenced to 25 years.

Kidnapped the next year along with their infant child, Mariana, the couple were taken to Automotores Orletti, a detention centre that acted as the headquarters of Operation Condor in Buenos Aires. The Uruguayan couple were murdered and their one-year-old child was given to Argentinian intelligence officer Miguel Angel Furci to raise as his own. It was only 16 years later, in 1992, that Mariana Zaffaroni was reunited with her biological family. Furci was also among the condemnedon Friday, sentenced to 25 years, on dozens of counts of torture and illegal arrest at the Orletti centre.    Related: Legacy of the junta casts a dark shadow over contemporary writers in Argentina    Although the role of the US in Condor was not under examination, substantial evidence was produced during the three-year trial concerning Washington\u2019s role. \u201cWe obtained documentation, both from declassified files of the US state department and from South American records, showing that the US was aware that Condor was killing people and even provided technical assistance,\u201d said Palm\u00e1s Zald\u00faa. \u201cThere is evidence the CIA provided computers and that Condor members communicated via a US telex service based in Panama.\u201d One US state department document from October 1981 related how Condor members \u201ckeep in touch with one another through a US communications installation in the Panama canal zone, which covers all of Latin America\u201d. Although the telex service, dubbed Condortel, was officially meant to be used by South American officers under military training by the US in Panama, the document, a cable from the US embassy in Paraguay to Washington, states that \u201cit is also employed to coordinate intelligence information among the Southern Cone countries\u201d. The document adds: \u201cThis is the Condor network which all of us have heard about over the last few years.\u201d New revelations regarding the role of the US in Condor could emerge in the near future. \u201cSo far we have only seen US state department files,\u201d said lawyer Palm\u00e1s Zald\u00faa. \u201cWe expect to find much more information once Pentagon and CIA files relating to the period of South America\u2019s military dictatorships are released.\u201d President Barack Obama promised to release all US files, including military and intelligence records, during his visit to Argentina in March this year. \u201cI believe we have a responsibility to confront the past with honesty and transparency,\u201d he said.",
