  "body": "As Chinese activist and scholar Teng Biao sat at home on the east coast of America, more than 13,000km (8,000 miles) away his wife and nine-year-old daughter were preparing to embark on the most dangerous journey of their lives. \u201cMy wife didn\u2019t tell my daughter what was going on,\u201d said Teng, who had himself fled China seven months earlier to escape the most severe period of political repression since the days following the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. \u201cShe said it was going to be a special holiday. She told her they were going on an adventure.\u201d One year after their dramatic escape through southeast Asia, Teng\u2019s family has been reunited in New Jersey and is part of a fast-growing community of exiled activists and academics who feel there is no longer a place for them in Xi Jinping\u2019s increasingly repressive China. Jerry Cohen, a veteran China expert who has offered help to many of the new arrivals, said he had seen a significant spike in the number of Chinese scholars such as Teng seeking refuge in the US last year. Until about 12 months ago China\u2019s top universities \u201cremained islands of relative freedom\u201d, said Cohen, who has studied the Asian country for nearly six decades. \u201c[Now] I think there is much more attention to what you teach, what materials you use, what you say in class, what you can write and publish, whom you can contact, where you get your support. I think a lot of people are just getting disillusioned and feel at least for a few years they\u2019d better ride out the Xi Jinping storm [overseas].\u201d     President Xi Jinping has been accused of overseeing an unprecedented crackdown designed to silence opposition to the Communist party. Photograph: Anna Isakova/TASS    Cohen likened the influx of intellectuals \u2013 mostly political scientists or international relations and law experts who have sought permanent or temporary positions at US universities \u2013 to previous waves of refugee scholars who fled the Nazis during the 1930s and 40s, and China following the Tiananmen crackdown. The most famous was Albert Einstein, who moved to Princeton in October 1932 and campaigned to help other Jewish refugees secure asylum. \u201cIt is not as dramatic as the refugees from Hitler; not as dramatic as the enormous number who turned up [after Tiananmen] and we had to deal with,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut it is growing and I am seeing them.\u201d Carl Minzner, an expert in Chinese law and politics at Fordham University in New York, said he had also noticed an increase in Chinese academics \u201cstrategically opting to have one foot out of the door\u201d by relocating to the US. \u201cYou are a small ship that is being tossed in the storm and everybody is looking for their safe harbour,\u201d he said. When Xi came to power in November 2012, some observers hoped his 10-year reign might usher in a period of political and economic reform. They pointed to Xi\u2019s father, the reform-minded party elder Xi Zhongxun, as evidence of the liberal tendencies of China\u2019s incoming leader. Instead Xi\u2019s ascent marked the start of what many observers now call an unprecedented crackdown designed to silence opposition to the Communist party ahead of a painful economic slump. Activists, journalists, bloggers, feminists, labour campaigners, religious leaders and rights lawyers have been interrogated, harassed or even disappeared and jailed. Liberal academics have also come under increasing pressure.     Since arriving in the US Teng Biao has remained active on Twitter and kept in touch with a global network of human rights lawyers, officials, politicians and campaigners.

In a recent interview with the New York Review of Books, the head of one prominent thinktank said the situation had become intolerable. \u201cAs a liberal, I no longer feel I have a future in China,\u201d said the academic, who is in the process of moving abroad. Teng, 42 and a former lecturer at Beijing\u2019s University of Politics and Law, said Xi\u2019s rise to power had been a turning point. \u201cThings got worse rapidly after Xi came in,\u201d he said, speaking in his office in New York University, where he is now a researcher. \u201cPresident Xi lowered the threshold for imprisoning people, and adopted a zero tolerance policy on human rights.\u201d As one of China\u2019s most prominent civil rights lawyers Teng found himself at the eye of the storm. He was one of the founding members of the New Citizens\u2019 Movement \u2013 a now defunct civil rights coalition wiped out by security services after Xi came to power \u2013 and, even before Xi\u2019s rise, faced repeated spells of house arrest and surveillance. In September 2014, as Beijing\u2019s crackdown deepened, he decided to abandon China, flying out of Hong Kong with his youngest daughter to take a position at Harvard University through its Scholars At Risk program. \u201cI felt that the space of civil society had become so limited I had to leave,\u201d said Teng, a graduate of the prestigious Peking University. Many of the Chinese academics now rolling up on American shores prefer to keep a low profile to avoid attracting unwelcome attention from Chinese secret police.

Since touching down in the US he has remained as active as ever, posting on Twitter and other social media and keeping in touch digitally with a global network of human rights lawyers, officials, politicians and international campaigners. On Wednesday he will appear at a session of the Conservative party human rights commission in London for the launch of a report about the deteriorating situation under Xi. Recently Teng has also been hyperactively disseminating material from the Panama Papers in an attempt to try and pierce the Chinese government\u2019s severe censorship of documents revealing that relatives of some of the top leaders had been hiding wealth in secretive offshore companies. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to spread the information on WeChat and Twitter. They delete the posts, but we then re-post it. Even though the censorship is very strict we can play this cat and mouse game, and then some Chinese people will know about this and the authority of Xi Jinping and the top leaders and their family members will be impacted.\u201d The life of an exile does not come without a cost. Teng, originally from Jilin province in northeast China, says he misses his family and friends back home, \u201cbut mostly I miss the feeling I had when fighting for freedom and human rights together with my fellow lawyers and defenders. It was both interesting and meaningful. We knew it was risky, we knew we could be put into prison or have other trouble, but all of us thought it was worth trying to do something to push forward with the law and freedom in China.\u201d He said he also suffers from what he called \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d: \u201cSo many lawyers, many of them my close friends, are in prison and in detention. I am free, so I feel I have a special obligation to speak for them.\u201d Cohen said he sensed great sorrow among many of the uprooted academics he met. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to leave. They were playing important roles in their universities or their law schools or whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course if they end up getting a professorship at Columbia or Singapore they have to see the virtue of that \u2013 they have children to take care of. \u201cBut it is a sad thing for them to be stimulated by repression to have to leave their own country, even if some of them are lucky and land on their feet.\u201d   Related: Chinese corruption gets House of Cards treatment with Communist mini-series    Cohen predicted that in exile many would simply become \u201csecond-class citizens and will never achieve what they could have had they stayed home\u201d. For now, Teng said his family was happy in New Jersey. His two daughters, now eight and 10, have enrolled in a primary school where he said they were no longer force-fed propaganda about \u201cthe Great Chairman Mao Zedong\u201d or Lei Feng, a Mao-era military officer held up by Beijing as an example of devotion to the Communist party. Despite having to live thousands of miles from home, he tries to keep his children in touch with their Chinese roots. \u201cWe tell them that Chinese culture is wonderful but that the current political system is not good.\u201d In April, amid the intensifying crackdown, Xi said the Communist party \u201cshould fully trust intellectuals and create a favourable environment for them to exercise their talent and develop their careers\u201d in China. Scholars \u201cshould not be blamed or punished for expressing their opinions,\u201d Xi said, according to the official Xinhua news agency \u2013 but they should also be sure to follow the \u201cright path\u201d. For now a return to China, where some of Teng\u2019s best friends still languish in jail, is not on the cards. \u201cI want to, but I\u2019m quite sure that Xi Jinping and the Communist party will not allow open society and political reform, and they will not give up their power. Life will remain very difficult for human rights activists,\u201d he said. Yet even in these dark times, he remains optimistic, vowing to continue fighting from afar so his daughters might one day return home to a changed country. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure they will come back to a free and democratic China,\u201d Teng said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it will take but many dissidents and activists are fighting for a better China. They don\u2019t want the next generation living in fear.\u201d",
