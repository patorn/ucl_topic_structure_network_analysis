  "body": "Anoa Changa is a feminist who isn\u2019t going to vote for Hillary Clinton. Last July, when the 34-year-old Atlanta-based attorney began volunteering with the grassroots organization Women for Bernie Sanders, she received immediate pushback from other women. Over social media, they accused her and other Sanders volunteers of betraying their gender, and of being fake feminists. Even former professors and friends questioned how she could support the Vermont senator over the secretary of state. \u201cSome women I encounter act as if I\u2019ve betrayed some kind of secret society,\u201d says Changa. \u201cI reject this brand of feminism. I\u2019m not only voting for my gender, I\u2019m voting for other issues.\u201d For the first time in its history, America is close to electing a female president, yet many women from across the political spectrum don\u2019t like Clinton.  It\u2019s true that, as a whole, women support her more than both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, but that support is not nearly as overwhelming as black voter support was for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Millennial women, for example, prefer Sanders to Clinton and 49% of American women give the secretary of state an unfavorable rating.    I\u2019m not only voting for my gender, I\u2019m voting for other issues  Anoa Changa     Women from across the political spectrum, who often can\u2019t agree on basic policy, are united in their opposition to Hillary. Many women simply don\u2019t see themselves reflected in Clinton. While most second-wave feminists know her long record of women\u2019s rights advocacy and want to see a female commander-in-chief in their lifetimes, younger feminists are more concerned with a movement that includes women from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. \u201cI\u2019m sure for a certain class of women [Hillary Clinton] is perfect,\u201d says Changa, who has lived in Harlem and Chicago\u2019s South Side and was a single mom throughout college. \u201cBut there are a lot of issues that affect low-income women, immigrant women and women of color that her brand of doing things is not going to address.\u201d Changa feels Sanders\u2019 campaign for free tuition, a $15 minimum wage and Wall Street corruption tackles the roots of poverty \u2013 an issue that disproportionately affects women \u2013 better than Clinton\u2019s platform. Changa is not moved by \u201chistorical firsts\u201d, especially since she doesn\u2019t think Obama\u2019s presidency improved black people\u2019s lives.  \u201cYay, I get to look at someone who looks like me,\u201d Changa says of his victory, \u201cbut what does that mean when my life chances aren\u2019t directly affected?\u201d      A Bernie Sanders supporter holds an anti-Hillary Clinton sign during a campaign rally. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    It\u2019s not only Sanders supporters who don\u2019t feel represented by Clinton. Joy Pullmann, a 29-year-old who supported Ted Cruz, definitely doesn\u2019t see herself in the secretary of state. The pro-life mother of four opposes any government intervention into her personal life and thinks Clinton\u2019s policies on healthcare, daycare and maternity restrict her freedom of choice. \u201cWhen women or anyone are free to chart their own course in life, then they are going to be happier and be better contributors to society,\u201d says Pullmann, who used midwives to birth her children and proudly negotiated a work-from-home arrangement so she can raise her kids and keep her job. \u201c[Clinton\u2019s] message is that if women don\u2019t follow her script for being a good woman, \u2018well sucks to you, you can just pay taxes to pay for all the ladies who do.\u2019\u201d Pullmann thinks Clinton, as an ambitious politician, is out of touch with most American women\u2019s family values and cringes at the presidential hopeful\u2019s attempts to \u201cplay up her maternal and feminine soft side\u201d. Clinton\u2019s widely shared family photos have done little to convince Pullmann that she\u2019s a good mother or grandmother. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her Twitter feed holding her little granddaughter, and Bill\u2019s behind her and I\u2019m like \u2018Look, you hate Bill\u2019s guts \u2026 [and] how much time are you spending with that baby? Not much, you\u2019re campaigning for president, you can hardly sleep.\u201d Pullmann feels no kinship for the secretary of state based on gender. \u201cI actually think it\u2019s offensive to say I should vote for someone because she has a vagina,\u201d she says. \u201cI do not want to be hired and promoted because I\u2019m the diversity hire \u2026 that just insults my abilities.\u201d Pullmann wouldn\u2019t mind if there was never a female president, so long as male candidates are the most qualified for the job. But while gender can seem irrelevant, studies show that states with a woman in high office elect more women to positions of power (women are half the population, yet make up only 20% of the US Congress). Nichola Gutgold, a professor at Penn State University who has written books on women and politics, says symbolic victories can have real effects, especially for the next generation. \u201cThat physical manifestation of a female president would certainly help younger women get into the political arena,\u201d she says. \u201cChildren really believe only men can be president because that\u2019s all they have seen.\u201d But Sanders supporter Victoria Bruce thinks that argument is outdated. The 49-year-old geologist and film-maker says it \u201cwould never occur\u201d to her 12-year-old daughter that she couldn\u2019t be commander-in-chief because of her gender. Bruce admits raising her child in Maryland means she is surrounded by other progressive people, but, in general, she thinks the feminist movement has evolved beyond gender-based votes.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel like the balance of power is off because there hasn\u2019t been a female president,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want a token woman. All her policies to me are against women and children and families.\u201d Bruce\u2019s list of Clinton criticisms is long \u2013 support for fracking, tough-on-crime policies and hawkish foreign policy to name just a few \u2013 all issues that she considers more important than a candidate\u2019s gender. \u201cThe fact that Sanders isn\u2019t a woman isn\u2019t even in my realm of consciousness,\u201d Bruce says, adding she would need a gun to her head before casting a vote for Clinton. \u201c[I vote for] the more compassionate person.\u201d Trump supporter Lynette Hardaway sees her candidate\u2019s lack of compassion as a strength. The North Carolina mother says American women would benefit most from a businessman running the country. \u201cHillary Clinton is not a take-charge person,\u201d says Hardaway, who adds that Obama is too \u201csoft-spoken\u201d and \u201clet things get out of hand\u201d. \u201cTrump knows that women want security, he knows women want good jobs, women want a strong economy, he will be good for women\u2019s health \u2026 He makes the women feel like \u2018we got y\u2019all.\u2019\u201d   Related: Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic race: \u2018Women don\u2019t lose elections because of sexism\u2019    While Trump and Sanders have been able to mobilize male voters with talk of outsider revolutions, Nancy Cohen, author of The Making of America\u2019s First Woman President, says women hesitate to rally around a candidate\u2019s gender. \u201cWe\u2019re reluctant to make the same claims to [political] representation that men seem to have no problems making,\u201d she says.  \u201cThere is this white male angry support for Trump and Sanders and that\u2019s called a movement. There\u2019s enthusiasm among a lot of women for Clinton \u2026 and that\u2019s derided as identity politics.\u201d  But Changa doesn\u2019t identify with Clinton or believe her victory would create a clearer path to Washington for black girls whose parents can\u2019t afford college tuition. \u201cAccess to opportunity in politics is often limited to people who are white or upper middle class,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we look at issues as gender only, it overshadows so many other ways that women are shut out of the process.\u201d Gutgold says even though some women might disagree with Clinton\u2019s policies, it\u2019s important to have women in high office who span the political spectrum. \u201cWe\u2019ve had space for every kind of male,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen are not monolithic we are all very different and in order to have complete freedom in this country we have to have an appreciation for and tolerance of all kinds of women running for office.\u201d  For Changa, that sort of logic is a slippery slope: \u201cWe can\u2019t have this false narrative that women can\u2019t be bad,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen can be as good as men but also as bad as men in terms of leadership.\u201d",
