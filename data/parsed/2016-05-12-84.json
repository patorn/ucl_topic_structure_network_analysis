  "body": "The first sound recorded during this interview with Ben \u201cMacklemore\u201d Haggerty and Ryan Lewis tells you a lot about where their heads are right now. Before a word has been spoken, Haggerty lets out a cavernous yawn, one that threatens never to end. \u201cTired?\u201d I ask as he slumps in front of me in a room backstage at the O2 in London. He nods\u00a0back, the energy for words still beyond him. There are obvious reasons why Haggerty might be knackered. He is currently six\u00a0months into a world tour promoting the duo\u2019s second studio album, This Unruly Mess I\u2019ve Made, a tour which, if tonight\u2019s show is anything to go by, requires every ounce of energy he can conserve: just over an hour from now, he will be performing slam-dunk leaps across the stage for the venue\u2019s 10,000-strong crowd. Haggerty also recently became a father for the first time, a calling to which he is so determined to give his all that this morning he got up early and took his daughter Sloane on a tour of London. But, even without any of this, you suspect being a part of Macklemore must be mentally exhausting. Ever since 2012, when songs such as Thrift Shop and Same Love launched his career, Haggerty has held the awkward position of the US\u2019s foremost white rapper, with all the identity baggage that brings: was he profiting from black culture? Why were better rappers selling a fraction of the records he was? You don\u2019t get to be a successful white rapper without facing such questions. While he was often humble and self-aware, his attempts to answer his critics could be clumsy \u2013 such as in 2014 when he won the Grammy for best rap album and decided not only to text Kendrick Lamar, admitting that he had been robbed, but then to screengrab the message and post it to Instagram.     \u2018The tour requires every ounce of energy he can conserve\u2019 \u2013 Macklemore playing the O2. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock    \u201cIf you make a mistake publicly, one that I\u2019m still talking about two years later,\u201d begins Haggerty, while Lewis giggles, \u201cyou realise that what the media chooses to highlight and create as the narrative lasts. So, you get more and more people afraid to truly put themselves out there. And that creates a culture of people who are constantly in a place of calculation.\u201d The criticism made Haggerty \u201cshrivel up\u201d and avoid the public eye.\u00a0He wouldn\u2019t make a mistake like that again, he decided, because he wouldn\u2019t put himself out there. And then something changed. On 24\u00a0November 2014, it was announced that Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot dead Michael Brown and sparked unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, would not face state criminal charges. The decision caused protests across the US. It also caused Macklemore to think about what his\u00a0place in all of this was, about whether his solidarity was desired, about on whose side a rapper who had profited from the power structure of systemic racism could legitimately claim to be. It was the flashpoint moment of a journey that ended with the creation of White Privilege II, the final track of This Unruly Mess I\u2019ve Made. It\u2019s a record unlike any you\u2019ll hear in pop right now, a nine-minute, multi-part exploration of Haggerty\u2019s guilt (\u201cThinking if they can\u2019t, how can I breathe? / Thinking that they chant, what do I sing? / I want to take a stance, \u2019cause we are not free / And then I thought about it, we are not we\u201d), the tangled, contradictory thinking of mainstream America and the acceptance that Haggerty is operating in a world set up in his favour (\u201cFake and so plastic, you\u2019ve heisted the magic / You\u2019ve taken the drums and the accent you rapped in\u201d). Ultimately, Haggerty questions whether or not he is prepared to risk what he has when it really matters: \u201cWe take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?\u201d         Macklemore and Ryan Lewis: White Privilege II.    Making a record that takes yourself to task so thoroughly, that dives headfirst into an issue loaded with controversy \u2013 that\u2019s quite a jump to make from being unwilling to put yourself out there, no? \u201cYeah, it was a jump,\u201d agrees Haggerty. \u201cBut watching the non-indictment on TV and then going out into the streets \u2026\u201d He pauses, as he does frequently. \u201cIt was a jump that I felt was essential to \u2026 who I am. Because the silent, I-don\u2019t-wanna-mess-up, fearful person that had emerged out of me is not who I truly am. And, on the night of the non-indictment, I got real clarity of what I could be doing with my art in terms of\u00a0speaking up, speaking out and getting outside of myself.\u201d For an outside observer, Macklemore can be a difficult cultural figure to untangle. Haggerty grew up as a middle-class kid in Seattle, releasing his debut album, The Language of My World, in 2005 before hooking up with Lewis in 2008. As producer, Lewis takes a hands-on approach, not only making beats, but also pushing Haggerty into lyrical spaces outside of his comfort zone. The pair have never been afraid to tackle social issues \u2013 2012 single Same Love was a passionate argument for gay and lesbian rights, which brought with it a fair amount of criticism for piggybacking on other people\u2019s struggles (rapper Le1f tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m gonna write a song about disabled people, or the aboriginal struggle. cuz mama needs a new fur coat.\u201d). But much of the duo\u2019s output is dedicated to sillier songs such as Let\u2019s Eat (\u201cFuck it man, I love fried shit!\u201d) and Brad Pitt\u2019s Cousin. Critics don\u2019t seem able to agree on what Macklemore should be doing: some say he needs to stop trying to write the white To Pimp a Butterfly and concentrate on his goofier pop side; others say he is able to use his rarefied position for good, so why undermine it with goofy pop hits about fast food? Their knack for novelty suggests they might not have treated a song about white privilege with the respect it deserves, yet nothing could be further from the truth. Hyper-aware of the criticism that might come their way, the pair reached out to black activists, scholars and songwriters to bring them onboard. \u201cAll very sceptical of what we were doing at the beginning,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cand rightly so.\u201d Georgia Roberts, Lewis\u2019s thesis adviser from his time at the University of Washington, gave them a weekly, three-hour schooling on race that lasted six months. Haggerty and Lewis even promised to support Black Lives Matter, the People\u2019s Institute for Survival and Beyond, Youth Undoing Institutional Racism and the Tyree Scott Freedom School (a project of American Friends Service Committee and the People\u2019s Institute) and Black Youth Project 100, putting out a statement that read: \u201cAs a company (Macklemore & Ryan Lewis LLC), we are committed to a long-term investment of our time, resources, finances and creative capacities towards supporting black-led organising and anti-racist education and discourse.\u201d In the words of rapper Talib Kweli: \u201cWhat [Macklemore is] attempting to do is exactly what activists ask white allies to do when dealing with the struggle. He is talking to other white folks on the song. He has black voices on the song. He is dealing with the issue head on. It\u2019s not something that comes from an abstract place \u2013 it comes from a real place.\u201d After countless lunches, phone calls, meetings and \u201cawesome conversations\u201d, they were left with something unique. But they had also been through a learning process so steep \u2013 \u201cthe more I learned, the more I realised that I know really very little\u201d is how Lewis puts it \u2013 that they began to question themselves and their motivations. \u201cOften you lose perspective on a song,\u201d explains Haggerty. \u201cBut it\u2019s more like: \u2018Do we get a bass, do we get a live drummer, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s go home and figure it out later.\u2019 This was more like: \u2018Should we even be doing this? Should this come out into the world?\u2019\u201d Did the duo ever wonder if the answer to all their self-analysis on White Privilege II was actually quite simple: that white people should stop making hip-hop? Haggerty nods: \u201cRyan hit a certain point in making the song that was kinda like: \u2018Wait ... so if this and this and this and this, then ... what are we doing?\u2019\u201d They both crack up before Haggerty continues. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to be objective, but I feel that, as long as I\u2019m using my voice for a cause that is greater than my own means, there is still a reason to continue.\u201d     Demonstrators mark the first anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown. \u2018On the night of the non-indictment, I got real clarity of what I could be doing with my art in terms of speaking up,\u2019 says Haggerty. Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images    Indeed, what Macklemore is saying on White Privilege II is something that only a white rapper could say \u2013 unlike on much of his back catalogue, where being white simply increased the chance it would sell in bucketloads, on White Privilege II, the fact Haggerty is white gives it a kind of perspective it wouldn\u2019t have were it to be delivered from the mouth of, say, Lamar. Regardless of whether you think it\u2019s a good record or not, it\u2019s hard to deny it\u2019s a unique one \u2013 thoughtful, tortured, brave, an attempt to address something that rarely gets addressed by a mainstream cultural figure. \u201cWhat makes any of us who we are is telling our honest, authentic story,\u201d says Haggerty. The artists that can do that, and make it resonate with people \u2026 that\u2019s what we\u2019re going for as songwriters.\u201d When White Privilege II dropped on January 22, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis were prepared for a reaction \u2013 but not the reaction they got. They had anticipated strenuous debates about structural racism; instead, for the first 48 hours, all the media seemed to care about was the fact Iggy Azalea was mentioned (\u201cThe culture was never yours to make better / You\u2019re Miley, you\u2019re Elvis, you\u2019re Iggy Azalea\u201d, ran the lyrics, which were wrongly interpreted as a straight diss): \u201cIt gave people something to talk about, because really they don\u2019t want to talk about systemic racism. \u2018Macklemore and Ryan Lewis take on systemic racism\u2019 is not going to get clicks or make someone pick up Rolling Stone.\u201d         Growing Up, Macklemore\u2019s collaboration with Ed Sheeran, is a paean to fatherhood.    Then came the jokes. \u201cNothing says white privilege like Macklemore releasing a nine-minute song about Black Lives Matter,\u201d said one tweet. \u201cEnd racism \u2013 so Macklemore stops writing songs about it,\u201d ran another. Haggerty gets it, but he still thinks this kind of criticism was off the mark. \u201cIt might potentially be a clever tweet or have some truth or irony or whatever, but to me it\u2019s not encapsulating the experience of what that song is, or the 10,000 kids that are going to hear it tonight at the show. Because if you get 10 of those 10,000 kids to talk about race after the show or talk about that moment, I\u2019d say that\u2019s better than not putting the song out in the first place.\u201d Other criticism was more robust. Some argued that, by condemning the white privilege from which he profits and turning it into a record, Macklemore was simply profiting off the back of it again. Lewis accepts this, too, but says \u201cwe realised there\u2019s no way to do the song at all without it benefiting [us] in some way, shape or form\u201d. He adds: \u201cIs the voice that you have ... a positive enough contribution to justify doing it?\u201d Besides, as Haggerty points out, was White Privilege II really that beneficial to their pop careers? \u201cPutting a song about race five weeks before your album comes out, as kind of the only thing you\u2019re putting out \u2026 that\u2019s not advantageous in terms of generating a radio song,\u201d he says. \u201cAgain, that\u2019s not some martyr shit, it\u2019s more just like what are we trying to be right now. Are we trying to be pop stars? Because I think we can do that version. Or are we trying to actually say something?\u201d Did they ever start to feel like, whatever they did, they couldn\u2019t win? \u201cIf winning is appeasing everyone then no, you can\u2019t win,\u201d says Haggerty. \u201cBut ... it\u2019s more complex than that.\u201d One criticism rests on how much Haggerty and Lewis are actually doing to help the black community. \u201cI\u2019m not here to defend or brag about what I do do,\u201d says Haggerty, \u201cbut what we\u2019ve made an effort to do is not only share the proceeds from the song, and not only our initial backing of certain black-led organisations, but a continued engagement and financial support that doesn\u2019t need to be a public thing.\u201d     \u2018Lewis takes a hands-on approach, not only making beats, but also pushing Haggerty into lyrical spaces outside of his comfort zone.\u2019 Photograph: David Bebber for the Guardian    Another, more prosaic, criticism levelled at Macklemore is that, while he might be doing the right thing, his music is simply not cool \u2013 it\u2019s too apologetic, lacking in nuance, too much like a well-meaning community workshop. Just contrast his approach with that of another famous white rapper, Eminem: on the Marshall Mathers LP, he managed to rip into the hypocrisy of white power structures without explicitly telling the world he was doing so \u2013 where he was a coiled, unapologetic ball of rage, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are a far less rock\u2019n\u2019roll prospect. At times, it\u2019s hard not to see them as a kind of hip-hop version of Spinal Tap\u2019s Artie Fufkin from Polymer Records, begging the world to kick their asses hard enough to atone for their position. From another perspective, it\u2019s hard not to admire their thick skin. \u201cAll art should be open for critique,\u201d says Haggerty. \u201cAnd particularly a song that is attempting to take on as many issues as White Privilege II does. What White Privilege II should be doing is getting people to have a conversation.\u201d There is, it should be noted, substance to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis beyond White Privilege II. On This Unruly Mess I\u2019ve Made, the track Kevin talks about the prescription drugs crisis currently tearing through the US (\u201cFirst dealer was his mom\u2019s medicine cabinet / Got anxiety, better go and give him a Xanax\u201d), while St Ides takes a nostalgic trip through teenage alcoholism (\u201cI used to steal my daddy\u2019s cabernet / Never thought it would turn into a rattlesnake\u201d). Macklemore has previously spent time in rehab for drug and alcohol addictions, including a brief relapse in 2011 that affected his working relationship with Lewis. Does he still need to keep an eye on things? \u201cYeah, it goes through my mind every day,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that will always be with me. But I think if I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m doing 12-step meetings and I\u2019m being of service to others, then the chances of me slipping back, regardless of what I\u2019m going through, aren\u2019t very high. If I\u2019m only working a couple of those, they go up. If I\u2019m not working any of it, then yes, I\u2019m going to relapse.\u201d I wonder if the stress of putting himself in the public eye makes it more of a challenge to stay on the wagon. \u201cYes. But then I\u2019ve always wanted to escape my own mind. When no one knew who the fuck I was, I wanted to get out of my own head, too. So, I can\u2019t blame any of the fame or the criticism for my drug addiction. It has been around since long before I had the thing with Macklemore, and it will be around a lot longer than Macklemore is relevant to the world.\u201d On a more positive note, Growing Up, his song with Ed Sheeran, talks about new fatherhood in sentimental but heartwarming fashion \u2013 Macklemore has a knack for being simultaneously relatable and a bit cheesy. Becoming a dad, he says, gave him \u201cimmediate reason every single day to not think about myself first\u201d. This could also describe the journey he has gone on with his music \u2013 the realisation that he is not the most important figure in all of this. \u201cThis is not about me. The Grammys aren\u2019t about me. Our success isn\u2019t about me. The machine isn\u2019t about me. And White Privilege isn\u2019t about me. What it\u2019s about is \u2013 can you still step into a place that is uncomfortable and show up because it\u2019s the right thing to do?\u201d In a country where black youths are routinely being shot dead by the police, you can easily see how a white guy agonising at length over whether or not he should be taking part in a protest looks indulgent and perhaps comically lacking in self-awareness. But, really, it depends on who you think is listening. Activists schooled in the struggle might mock White Privilege II, but what about Macklemore\u2019s white fans, who have never before been forced to think about how they benefit from systemic racism? Can\u2019t this be an education for them? For all the therapeutic wrangling the song goes through, its message is simple and positive: white people owe it to the black community to show up, to put themselves on the line, to help dismantle a system that puts them before others. As the interview draws to an end, Haggerty says: \u201cI would never think that because I made White Privilege II that I\u2019ve said enough, or that now I can step away from the conversation.\u201d Lewis agrees: \u201cWe soon learned while making White Privilege II that the song won\u2019t matter as much as continuing to do the work after the song is out.\u201d They might need to stifle those yawns a little longer \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be resting any time soon.",
