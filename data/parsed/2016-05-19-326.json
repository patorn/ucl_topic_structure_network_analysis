The journey is about to begin.\u201d The four boys and two girls listening to Eric Mamboue\u2019s pep talk in Bangui, the capital of a country condemned to decades of conflict by geography, misgovernance and malice, might be forgiven for feeling a little overwhelmed, but they do actually cherish big hopes and dreams, and know that staying in school is the first step to achieving them. In a country brought to its knees by three years of inter-ethnic and religious violence, where communities still live apart, and where any loud metallic noise makes people jump and wonder if the killing has started again, these children know that education is not just a way out for them: it could also save their country.   Related: 'The Central African Republic must be built from scratch'    \u201cWithout education, the problems will never end,\u201d says Jean*, an eloquent 17-year-old who wears a beaded purse embroidered with Bible verses around his neck. \u201cThe wise share their knowledge. People who are not wise try to destroy things. If we are not educated, things will go badly. If we are educated, the leaders of the future will be able to defend the country.\u201d The children are all taking part in VoiceMore, a pilot project run by War Child to train young people to speak out about their rights. Mamboue is War Child\u2019s country director in Central African Republic, and these children recently completed a six-day training course. They all have firsthand knowledge of what it means to have your right to education snatched away.  In 2013, when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels pushed into this green city set on the wide Oubangui river, they ousted the president and committed atrocities against Christians, triggering the formation of mainly Christian and animist anti-balaka (machete) militias, who took bloody revenge on Muslim communities.     Gardening, language and logic on the blackboard at a Unicef-funded temporary school for displaced children in Bangui.    The Seleka ousted then president Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, and installed their own man, Michel Djotodia. He was forced out in 2014, ceding power to a transitional government. Now a new president \u2013 Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra \u2013 has been elected, most of the Seleka have retreated to the north, and, in theory, the former French colony is entering a post-conflict stage. But for the hundreds of thousands of children who missed out on school for months, even years, much damage is already done. \u201cThe conflict affected our education. Our levels slipped. That could affect the future of our country when it is us who are the leaders of society,\u201d says Dieudonne*, 15.  His friends giggle nervously at this audacious vision of the future \u2013 they are just teenagers, despite what they have seen.  \u201cIn our family, we lost two, three people from gunfire,\u201d says 16-year-old Rose*. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even go to the funeral, couldn\u2019t get to the cemetery. If you didn\u2019t have money, you couldn\u2019t move through the streets. They would even take your clothes.\u201d     Free these children from the desire for vengeance, the spirit of hate and the desire for war  Marius Mobia     The rebels stole or burned schoolbooks, ripped out electricity wires, and smashed the photocopier at Jean\u2019s school. Across the country, schools were used as bases by militia on all sides. \u201cMy school stayed open but there were anti-balaka who came and hassled us and we couldn\u2019t come every day. Now, I know how important education is. It is the cornerstone of man\u2019s success,\u201d Jean says. After the Seleka lost control, there was a period of relative calm in Bangui, but in September, violence exploded again after a Muslim man was killed. And though many cite the Pope\u2019s visit in November as a significant step towards peace, there is a palpable tension everywhere. Today, Jean and his friends are back in class, but one-third of school-age children in CAR are not, and one-quarter of schools are still shut. Marius Mobia, from Enfants sans Fronti\u00e8res, which partners War Child to run after-school clubs on child rights, says education is key to overcoming the divisions caused by the conflict. Since 2013, many Muslims have fled CAR, or live in about a dozen enclaves in the west. \u201cIf my child goes to school, tomorrow he will replace me \u2026 If my child does not go to school, it means I don\u2019t want the country to flourish. [Education] is a cornerstone, it is inescapable in life,\u201d says Mobia, who has four children.  \u201cWe ask the international community to help us build schools, child-friendly spaces and centres where we can give psychological support to free these children from the desire for vengeance, the spirit of hate and the desire for war.\u201d   Related: 30 million children have lost their homes \u2013 they must not lose their education | Kevin Watkins    At a state school in another part of Bangui, director Benjamin Regakouzou says many children have become aggressive, while some teachers have been on strike since January because they have not been paid. \u201cEvery day, there are fights,\u201d he says, going to the corner of his office to take down a metre-long wooden gun made by one of the students from what looks like the arm of a chair and a long stick. \u201cHe put it at the back of the class like this,\u201d says Regakouzou, placing the gun, butt down, against the wall. \u201cThe teacher saw it and brought it to me. That\u2019s the effect of the crisis.\u201d   Factbox   Beside the M\u2019Poko airport, where about 20,000 displaced people live in shoulder-high shelters cobbled together from corrugated iron, tarpaulins or wood, the UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, and local partner Remod have opened a temporary learning space, known as an Etape (stage), for more than 6,000 children. Chancelin Ouilibona, the director, lives in the camp, as do all the teachers at the school \u2013 a series of tented rooms where older children sit on wooden benches and younger ones on mats. Ouilibona\u2019s family have been living here since Seleka rebels destroyed their home in 2013, stealing the roof, the doors, everything. \u201cThe children are traumatised,\u201d Ouilibona says. \u201cWe teach them about peace and social cohesion \u2026 These children must not think Muslims are our enemies and we theirs \u2026 They must know Muslims are their brothers.\u201d Because there is no electricity in the camp, many children study under the bright lights at the nearby base of a Rwandan contingent of the UN peacekeeping force, known as Minusca, which has around 12,000 troops here. About an hour\u2019s flight north of Bangui in the Bossangoa district, at a school near the Ouham river where hippos snort loudly as they surface, Sore*, 13, says she wants to be matron when she grows up. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go to school I am not a citizen. I am just a toto [silly in Sango]. If I go to school, I will work and become someone tomorrow,\u201d she says.     Children at a school in the Bossangoa region.    Crepin Namdenganana, who runs War Child\u2019s projects in this area, has a message for the international community as it meets in Istanbul for a summit meant to reset the humanitarian system and enable it to cope protracted crises, like the one in CAR.  \u201cIf I could appeal to the humanitarian family, I would say focus on education \u2026 In the third millennium, a person without education, or a person who is illiterate, is like a dead person because they won\u2019t be aware, and they won\u2019t understand what is around them.\u201d Jean says education is not only critical for reconciliation now, but can also prevent conflicts. \u201cIf there had been good education in the Central African Republic, we would not have descended into this crisis \u2026 Education is really poor. Many people don\u2019t know why they live, and it is easy to manipulate them,\u201d he says.  And he imbues this mature pragmatism with a shot of the boundless hope of teenagers.  \u201cTo stop this, and make sure there are no more rebellions, we have to fix [ethnic] racism, the religious problem and corruption. These things will not help our country, but liberty, dignity and fraternity will.\u201d *Names have been changed to protect identities",
