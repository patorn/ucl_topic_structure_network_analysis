  "body": "Roy Hodgson had wondered how Marcus Rashford might react to being thrown in at the deep end. England\u2019s coach half-feared the boy might freeze on his England debut but he need not have worried because the 18-year-old simply did what he always does in these sort of situations. In other words, Rashford scored with his first shot. It is what he did on his Europa League debut for Manchester United against Midtjylland before repeating that feat on his Premier League bow at Arsenal\u2019s expense. As an avid reader of some pretty heavyweight novels \u2013 (Milan Kundera anyone?) \u2013 Hodgson knows all about the importance of opening chapters and looked suitably gripped by the introduction the prodigy scripted for himself. Three minutes had passed when Rashford met Raheem Sterling\u2019s deflected cross with a fabulous right\u2011foot volley to propel England ahead. With a single, assured, swipe of a boot he had become the youngest player to score for the Three Lions on debut. On the England bench Wayne Rooney smiled but Daniel Sturridge \u2013 once again indisposed by a calf strain and not even a substitute \u2013 scowled as he sat with anorak hood pulled down over his forehead. The prospect of spending a chunk of the summer in France must have been receding before the Liverpool forward\u2019s eyes. If Rashford\u2019s audition for one of the last remaining seats on the train was going rather swimmingly \u2013 not to mention prompting a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu recalling Michael Owen\u2019s late dash to prominence at France 98 \u2013 his dramatic arrival on the international stage prompted mixed feelings among a capacity Wearside crowd. Excited as they were to see an emerging talent first-hand, many locals would have preferred to cheer on a familiar face. It explains why a particularly shapeless passage of England play on a night when Rashford\u2019s opener camouflaged Australia\u2019s early dominance prompted pointed choruses of \u201cJermain Defoe\u201d. Madonna\u2019s \u201cThis used to be my playground\u201d was not played on the stadium sound system before kick\u2011off but in the circumstances it might have been quite a good choice. This pitch may remain Defoe\u2019s playpen when Sunderland play here but there was a time when the striker largely responsible for keeping Sam Allardyce\u2019s side in the Premier League used to feel very much at home wherever England performed. After 18 goals in 33 appearances for a, frankly, poor side, Defoe \u2013 physically, an extremely young, uber-fit 33 \u2013 had hoped for a Euro 2016 England recall but Hodgson has made it clear that the crime of emigrating to Canada, however briefly, is not pardonable. \u201cDefoe went to Toronto before Sunderland,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re looking for players more akin to Vardy, Rooney and Sturridge, rather than one who has made his name as a fox in the box.\u201d At a stroke the England coach seemed to have swallowed the received wisdom believed temporarily by Allardyce, that he is \u201cnot a modern, all-round, striker\u201d. Yet when, in desperation, Sunderland\u2019s manager finally put him on his team-sheet Defoe not only proved surprisingly effective as a lone striker but his game has evolved and improved. Largely down to Rashford\u2019s compelling presence \u2013 and despite Sturridge\u2019s enduringly concerning physical fragility \u2013 Defoe\u2019s England days are firmly behind him but there remains a nagging sense Hodgson might come to regret that reality. There were protracted periods when even Rashford found himself a striker on the margins as Australia showed why they are Asian champions, but then Wythenshawe\u2019s newest celebrity reminded everyone he can create as well as score. Indeed, Rashford\u2019s clever pass over the defence to Adam Lallana could conceivably have conjured a second England goal had Mat Ryan not been equal to the danger. Significantly Rashford seemed to be bringing the best out in Sterling \u2013 not always the easiest of achievements just lately \u2013 while bewildering Bailey Wright and friends in Australia\u2019s back line. The move ultimately came to nothing, but the skill and intelligence involved as a marker was smartly dodged courtesy of a clever drag back more than hinted at a brilliant future. Having shifted from a central attacking position to the left, then right, of the front three once Rooney came on, Rashford showcased an enticing amalgam of adaptability and stellar, fluid, invariably high-speed movement. Hodgson\u2019s sidekick Gary Neville may have attempted to keep his feet on the ground with a rather brusque, unnecessarily stern handshake when Rashford was eventually replaced, to ringing applause, by Ross Barkley in the 63rd minute. Maybe Neville was cross about a rare poor touch and overhit delivery a few minutes earlier but Rashford had still done more than enough to leave Hodgson with a very big decision to make. And to think England\u2019s coach had not originally intended starting him on a night Harry Kane rested and the absent Jamie Vardy celebrated his recent wedding. Plan A had been to go with Sturridge and maybe give the tall, rangy, pacey product of Manchester United\u2019s academy some second-half minutes but, instead, Rashford offered compelling evidence that Plan B may be the best option after all.",
