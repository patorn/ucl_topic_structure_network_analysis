  "body": "The earliest known sketchbook kept by the artist Stanley Spencer, filled with beautiful drawings from nature, cartoons, jokes and a story about a little man regarded as very peculiar by the villagers \u2013 not unlike Spencer\u2019s relationship with his beloved home village of Cookham \u2013 has been rediscovered among papers kept by his daughter, and will be displayed for the first time in an exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield this summer.   Related: Unity Spencer: my father Stanley was naive    The battered notebook is carefully inscribed with the then 15-year-old Stanley\u2019s name and address and the fact that the book was a present from his older brother Horace, still remembered in the village as a gifted conjurer who would perform magic tricks for free drinks in the pub.  The handwriting is appalling, a teenager\u2019s sprawling scrawl in blurry pencil with profuse crossings out and corrections, but the drawings \u2013 minutely detailed studies of trees and riverbanks, meadows and distant church spires, and fantastic invented scenes including a procession of cavalry officers mounted on giant snails, captioned \u201cPatience is a virtue\u201d \u2013 are immaculate. The book was rediscovered by the exhibition\u2019s curator, Eleanor Clayton, and Spencer\u2019s grandson John Spencer among the voluminous family papers kept by the artist\u2019s daughter Unity. Clayton, who had thought all the papers were in the already vast archive kept in the Tate, was astonished at how much material remained uncatalogued and unstudied, including hundreds of letters, some of them scores of pages long.

Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    \u201cWhat is striking about the notebook is the revelation of his earliest interests,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cStanley always claimed that he had to paint landscapes to earn a living but that his real interest was in what he would have regarded as his more spiritual paintings, but here you can see the fascination with the detail of the natural world around him.\u201d     Stanley Spencer in front of one of his works in 1958. Photograph: John Pratt/Getty Images    The drawings are so meticulous that his grandson, who never met the artist but was also brought up in the Berkshire village of Cookham, can recognise individual trees that he climbed and played in. He knew there were shadows over his mother\u2019s early life, but none of the details, even though his best friend\u2019s garden bordered on the house where Spencer\u2019s second wife still lived.  Spencer left Hilda and his two young daughters \u2013 and eventually lost their family home \u2013 to marry Patricia Preece, a fellow artist, but she was gay and the marriage was never consummated. To his surprise his first wife declined to become his mistress. He captured the misery of his situation in some excruciatingly revealing paintings, including a double nude portrait, and another of the clothed artist gazing at his bored naked wife. His handwriting remained atrocious, his grandson confirmed. He is preparing the artist\u2019s autobiography, which eventually ran to millions of words but was never completed, for publication in three volumes from next autumn. \u201cStanley has no concept of the full stop \u2013 his problem was his writing couldn\u2019t keep up with the speed of his thoughts and what he wanted to express. He uses dashes and colons, but usually the sentences are never finished \u2013 sometimes a capital letter pops up to indicate where a full stop might have gone. You do need a forensic team to make sense of it all.\u201d   Related: My hero Stanley Spencer    The exhibition takes its title from Spencer\u2019s proclamation \u201cI am on the side of the angels and dirt\u201d, and will bring together self-portraits, landscapes, portraits and paintings \u2013 some of which Clayton feels may need an \u201cover-18 only\u201d warning \u2013 created for his unrealised dream of the Church House that would illuminate his own singular spiritual beliefs, including chapels celebrating all the women in his life. Loans are coming from public collections, including Spencer\u2019s monumental Ship Building on the Clyde series from the Imperial War Museum, and from private collections including paintings not publicly exhibited in decades. John Spencer recalled that weeks before his death in 1959 his grandfather wondered aloud whether anyone would remember him. More than half a century later, he is regularly voted one of Britain\u2019s best-loved painters.  Stanley Spencer: Of Angels and Dirt will be at Hepworth Wakefield from 24 June to 5 October.",
