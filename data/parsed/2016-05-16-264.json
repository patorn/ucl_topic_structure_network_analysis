  "body": "The life of a corporate lawyer isn\u2019t for everyone. First comes law school, full of soon-to-be politicians and posh boys guffawing their way through EU lectures. Then, if you get a training contract, your first five years at a firm will likely be spent working your socks off, slogging through endless reading and eating lukewarm Deliveroos in the office after 10pm.  But before you give up on the law entirely, or resign yourself to a lifetime of desk dinners, why not consider going freelance? Legal culture has changed in recent years and flexible work has become a significant part of the industry.     The freelance path is now seen as attractive and aspirational  Tom Hartley, Lawyers On Demand     Whether you\u2019re a part-time DJ in Ibiza, a mum wanting to spend more time at home, or a cake-maker extraordinaire, the case for going freelance is a compelling one. There are businesses out there, such as Lawyers On Demand, Axiom and Vario, that match interesting clients with solicitors who want more control over their caseload. The work is still top quality and you don\u2019t necessarily have to take a pay cut.  According to Tom Hartley, managing director of Lawyers On Demand, which began in 2007 and now has more than 600 lawyers, the business has doubled in the last three years and the market is booming. \u201cSolicitors get to select jobs with clients that suit their skills and interests and fit with how they want to work,\u201d he says. \u201cThis might be full time, on site at a law firm, working on a big deal \u2013 or a week at home reviewing commercial contracts.\u201d \u201cThe freelance path is now seen as attractive and aspirational; it enables lawyers to work for big names like Google, Barclays and Vodafone on their own terms.\u201d Hartley says one of the main attractions of flexible working is that it allows people to have a life outside of the law. \u201cSome of our lawyers have other interests which take up their time \u2013 we have a corporate lawyer who takes the winter off to run his ski business, and a DJ based in Ibiza.\u201d   Related: How do I decide what type of lawyer I want to be?    Kay Ma, who is three years qualified and trained in-house in a two-person legal team for a global company, says she chose to go freelance so she can spend more time on her novelty cake-making business. \u201cA lot of freelance solicitors are good lawyers \u2013 and something else. The work-life balance I now have, and also any downtime I have between contracts, enables me to work on building my business,\u201d she says. \u201cI can be a serious lawyer and have other interests without feeling like I am committing adultery on my career.\u201d David Wides, a commercial lawyer who is 10 years qualified, agrees. He says he thought he\u2019d be office-bound in the same job forever. Instead, working on a freelance basis has given him the freedom to travel. \u201cI was envious of friends in other jobs who were able to work on great short-term contract roles and take time off to travel in between. Now, I get to decide what trips I want to do and I plan my work around them.  \u201cBefore, I was always worrying whether my work would allow me time to take holidays at all, and I was worried about the pile of work waiting for me on my return. With freelancing this isn\u2019t an issue.\u201d As well as the freedom to focus on other things, freelance lawyers say they haven\u2019t had to sacrifice the quality of their work. \u201cIt allows you to do top-notch work at reputable companies and, in many ways, it makes you even more attractive as businesses are often keen to work with people who have had varied experience across different industries,\u201d says Wides.  So, could feeling pressured to be the last one to leave the office soon be a thing of the past? Ma says it is, adding: \u201cBeing freelance gives me flexibility and I have the option to work at a client site, at home, or in a cafe if I want to. Who knows, one day I might even open a cake shop and work remotely as a lawyer from there.\u201d This work style is equally good for clients: they can get top lawyers whenever they need them, often at a cheaper rate than using traditional law firms. Even existing firms are starting to embrace the model. Using freelance lawyers helps reduce their overheads and any extra costs, such as holiday pay and maternity leave. It also allows them to offer more services to clients when they need a specific skill or to meet a surge in work.   Related: Law students: look beyond London for a better work-life balance    \u201cThe career path of lawyers is shifting to accommodate increasing expectations around achieving work/life balance,\u201d says Andrew Darwin, chief operating officer at DLA Piper. \u201cLaw firms need to be able to meet such expectations in order to retain and motivate the best talent. The traditional law firm is no longer the only choice for lawyers and law firms need to respond to this.\u201d He adds that allowing lawyers to work flexibly has enabled the firm to reconnect with former employees who are still interested in working for them, but on a more flexible basis. \u201cWe also view it as a platform to allow for our people to take a career break for a variety of reasons, while remaining connected with the firm, perhaps returning to us in a permanent capacity again at a later stage.\u201d There are, however, some drawbacks. Not only can you miss out on long-term friendships in the office, but the nature of freelancing means that work is never guaranteed \u2013 and if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get paid. Gemma Thompson, a corporate lawyer who is two years qualified, thinks going freelance is tempting, but there\u2019s too much risk attached to it. \u201cIt would be nice to have more flexible hours, but this usually means you don\u2019t have the same job security. Maybe that will change in time, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s quite there yet.\u201d For Ma, though, less work can actually be an advantage. \u201cSome would say this is the worst thing, and I won\u2019t lie, on some days between contracts it can feel that way, but those days are the exception,\u201d she says. \u201cGoing freelance means accepting that risk and making the most of that time to focus on other things or to take a break, and get ready to start the next job refreshed.\u201d Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents \u2013 and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.",
