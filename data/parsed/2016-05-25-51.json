  "body": "I read Michele Hanson\u2019s article (G2, 24 May) with a wry smile, having spent time earlier modifying a friend\u2019s computer to prevent it updating to Windows 10, as the same thing had nearly happened to me last month. What happens is that Microsoft installs a Trojan horse update along with all the normal ones. Sometime later this malware initiates an upgrade to Windows 10 without asking permission, and no method of cancellation without turning the computer off. To prevent this happening, you need to uninstall update number KB3035583 (go to control panel, Windows update, installed updates, then find the right update KB3035583 right click on it and click uninstall). You may want to stop Microsoft installing it again by switching off automatic updates (Windows update, change settings). I have heard many stories of people who have upgraded to Windows 10 and found numerous problems using their computer, including lost data. Microsoft may claim to have asked permission, but they haven\u2019t \u2013 the only permission they had was to install updates (mainly fixes) to the existing operating system, not to change it completely. Maybe you should publish an article in the main section of the Guardian (pity you got rid of your tech section!).David MurrayAsh, Surrey \u2022 Michele Hanson and I seem to lead almost parallel lives but this week the coincidence was incredible as only last evening, I experienced an unsolicited invasion from Microsoft! I turned my back for a few minutes, only to find my PC was \u201cupgrading\u201d Windows of its own accord. For over an hour, I was unable to access my e-mails or do any of the work I had planned. Like Michele, I was furious. Unlike Michele, I chose to decline the legal agreement which appeared on screen after the download. This allowed me to revert to Windows 7. Of course, I was pestered by one of those \u201cAre you sure?\u201d messages which I cancelled. I have made a conscious decision not to change from using Windows 7 to 10 as I know I will lose a lot of useful software that currently I use free of charge. It means I have to routinely decline an offer to upgrade to Windows 10. I am very concerned that Microsoft is doing this without users\u2019 permission \u2013 and I am clearly not alone. I can only conclude that they want us all to download a system which will allow them to track our activities more closely \u2013 and oblige us to pay for every item of software on a separate basis.Jennifer PearceLondon \u2022 Thanks to Michelle Hanson forher Windows 10 grumble. I was horrified last evening when I woke up my PC to find it busy changing my operating system without any approval by me. I had deleted every one of the twice a day messages asking me to allow the changeover and assumed I would continue with Windows 7. Having suffered the problems of learning new methods and layouts when 7 superseded XP \u2013 not easy at 87 \u2013 I wanted a lot of reassurance before plunging into unknown waters. Fortunately clicking \u201cdecline\u201d when asked to agree to the terms and conditions caused a reinstall to start but the terror of losing all my files haunts me. Shame on Windows!Keith ThomasLiverpool \u2022 If Windows 10 starts to install, the worst thing you can do is start hitting keys at random (Letters, 25 May). If there\u2019s no cancel option, artificially stopping the process may lead to corruption and an unusable computer. Better to let the process complete and then, if you don\u2019t like the result, exercise the option, which lasts for 30 days, to go back to how things were.Henry MaltHuntingdon \u2022 David London (Letters, 25 May) was right to stop the automatic upgrade to Windows 10. Like a fool, I allowed mine to continue. Windows 10 is awful. The screen is dark. The font and icons are squashed. Windows 7 was much clearer. I don\u2019t suppose I can go back now. I was the victim of a dirty trick. If there was ever a case of \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it\u201d, this is it. I no longer respect Bill Gates.Erik WilliamsCardiff \u2022 The same thing happened to me. But all was not lost. When I put my laptop on the following morning I found that there was an option to accept Windows 10 or to reject it, which I promptly did.Marie PatersonNuneaton, Warwickshire \u2022 I tried Windows 10, and didn\u2019t like it \u2013 in particular Windows XP mode didn\u2019t work (which allows one to run old programs), and which Microsoft say that they have no plans to install on Windows 10. So I reinstalled Windows 7, but then found, like Michele Hanson and David London, Windows 10 reinstalling itself. There are two things you need to do to stop this: first turn off automatic updates; and second there\u2019s a bit of freeware called Never10 which removes all the Windows 10 stuff from your PC that is taking up almost 4GB of space. It works.Ian WatsonCarlisle \u2022 Windows? It\u2019s PC gone mad.Brian SmithBerlin \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
