  "body": "You wouldn\u2019t call Kaytranada an expert salesman of his music. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says when asked about his hopes for his debut album, 99.9%. \u201cI really hope people create memories and have good times with it. But if they don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s whatever, there\u2019s other things they can listen to.\u201d It\u2019s not quite what you expect. After all, 99.9% is packed with guest appearances from 2016\u2019s hottest \u2013 Vic Mensa, Anderson Paak, Syd tha Kyd, as well as the year\u2019s comeback hero, Craig David. It\u2019s released on the none-more-cool XL Recordings. It follows a string of remixes that have established him as one of music\u2019s most imaginative manipulators of sound, repurposing scores of artists, including MIA, Beyonc\u00e9, Missy Elliott, Azealia Banks, Disclosure, Pharrell Williams and Janet Jackson \u2013 both officially and unofficially \u2013 as well as production work with the Internet, Anderson Paak, Katy B, Talib Kweli, Freddie Gibbs and many others. What propelled him from bedroom producer to top-flight remixer was his bass-heavy bootleg adaptation of Janet Jackson\u2019s If in 2012, which became a Soundcloud sensation. He followed it the following year with a version of Be Your Girl by Teedra Moses, with sped-up vocals, and was given a Saturday-night residency on Radio 1. Soon after, he was out on the road DJing across the US and Europe, but began to feel typecast. He needed to stop \u2013 not just the DJing, but the remixing, he says. He needed to become himself. In 2015 he decided: no more shows, at least for a while. 99.9% is as much mood music as dance music. But the mood is party, rather than introspection. And while Kaytranada might be associated with electronic music, there\u2019s a looseness to his grooves \u2013 his music is funky, rather than strictly programmed. \u201cI signed the deal [with XL] in 2014, and it didn\u2019t make much sense that I had to go on tour when none of my music was out, only my remixes,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not just a remix guy. Right now, everyone is offering me remixes, but I just don\u2019t have the motivation like I did before. I will eventually, for sure, but it\u2019s not what I am into right now.\u201d Kaytranada was born Louis Celestin, in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, in 1992; the family moved to Montreal the following year. His dad worked as a taxi driver and an estate agent; his mother in healthcare. His parents gave him a strict Haitian upbringing until they divorced when he was 14. The discipline at home couldn\u2019t keep him focused at school, though. \u201cI was really not into school. Everything was distracting to me. I would have a beat in my head or a song. I was always not paying attention, just daydreaming,\u201d he says, fidgeting. \u201cI didn\u2019t finish high school. I tried to as an adult, but with all this touring I had to quit.\u201d     Live \u2026 Kaytranada at London\u2019s Lovebox festival , 2015. Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Redferns    In March, he headlined London\u2019s 5,000-capacity Brixton Academy. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful to have played there, but it\u2019s not my vibe to play in front of all those people,\u201d he says. \u201cI prefer a house party vibe. Just the local place to have fun. It\u2019s always weird to me to be on those stages with all this responsibility.\u201d He is dealing with issues in other parts of his life, too. He has experienced depression, and believes the cause of his problems was dealing with his sexuality. Earlier this month, he told Fader magazine that he is gay, and that coming out to his family had been a source of anxiety. \u201cWe\u2019re Haitians, and Haitians don\u2019t appreciate gay people at all,\u201d he told Fader. \u201cI thought maybe it was a phase.\u201d Speaking now, he says a whole bunch of things had come together. \u201cI had a lot of fatigue, and a real identity crisis and a bunch of stuff that I was going through, like my sexuality.\u201d Then there was the music. \u201cI felt pressured to complete the album quickly, and, on the other hand, I couldn\u2019t escape the image of being a DJ.\u201d Yet, for all the stress, he has learned to let go. One of the ways 99.9% is being promoted is with a video game, but Kaytranada was happy to have nothing to do with that. \u201cI suck at video games. The label came up with that concept,\u201d he says, laughing. 99.9%, though, doesn\u2019t sound like the work of a man who doesn\u2019t care, who is consumed with worry. It ducks in and out of styles, like a joyride through R&B, hip-hop and electronica. And Kaytranada sounds almost euphoric talking about Anderson Paak\u2019s contribution. \u201cHe asked me for beats \u2013 then he would do complete songs and even bring guests. The guy is amazing.\u201d Then the hesitancy creeps in. \u201cI can\u2019t say whether or not it\u2019s my best work. Maybe people will see it in another way.\u201d \u2022 99.9% is released on XL on 6 May",
