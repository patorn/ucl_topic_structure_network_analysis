  "body": "Nationals starting pitcher Stephen Strasburg will be in Washington for the forseeable future after signing a seven-year deal on Tuesday, reputed to be worth about $175m. Strasburg will receive a rolling opt-out clause after the third or fourth year of the contract, which would allow him to become a free agent at 31 or 32. The right-hander, who has spent his entire MLB career with the Nationals, is off to an outstanding start, going 5-0 with a 2.76 ERA after allowing four runs on Monday. Strasburg is 59-37 with a 3.06 ERA through 139 career starts.   Related: Washington Nationals' flaws make Hack-a-Harper a sound tactic    \u201cEnsuring that Stephen will remain a part of our organization for years to come is a proud moment for our entire family,\u201d the Nationals managing principal owner, Ted Lerner, said. \u201cWe are very fond of Stephen and his entire family, and we\u2019ve thought very highly of them since he became such an integral part of our organization almost seven years ago. We\u2019re honored that he feels the same way about the Washington Nationals, and very happy to keep him pitching in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201d The new deal matches Felix Hernandez\u2019s contract with the Mariners for the sixth highest among big league pitchers. David Price\u2019s deal with the Red Sox is worth a record $217m over seven years. The 27-year old Strasburg was on the mound for the Nationals\u2019 5-4 victory over the Tigers on Monday night, but declined to talk about the deal. \u201cI\u2019m just focusing on this game and stuff like that,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cAll that stuff is going to work itself out eventually. I\u2019m really excited for the way the guys played behind me tonight, picked me up in the end.\u201d But he did say that he enjoyed playing in Washington. \u201cGrowing up in southern California, San Diego, all my life and stuff, the east coast is a little bit of a change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the city of DC has been great to me and my family. It\u2019s really grown on us. We\u2019re very comfortable here.\u201d Strasburg, a San Diego State product, was drafted first overall by the Nationals in 2009. He underwent elbow surgery in 2010.",
