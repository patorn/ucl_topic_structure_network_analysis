Related: A third of headteachers say school buildings not fit for purpose    A 60% reduction in the government\u2019s schools capital budget is producing a new generation of overly standardised new buildings which cost \u00a3150m a year more to run than they should, according to the RIBA. It found that one in 20 teachers who had left their job cited poor building conditions and one in five had considered it.  \u201cThe prevalence of damp, leaky classrooms and asbestos-ridden buildings in British schools means too many pupils and teachers are struggling to learn and teach in conditions damaging to their health and education,\u201d the report claims. It will reignite a row between architects and the Department for Education (DfE) over the value of design skills. In 2010 Michael Gove, then education secretary, scrapped Labour\u2019s \u00a355bn schools building programme, which had commissioned Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers to design schools.  Gove accused architects of \u201ccreaming off\u201d fees that should have gone to teaching and replaced the programme with a cheaper, more standardised approach, and said: \u201cNo one is here to make architects richer.\u201d But RIBA has called on Gove\u2019s successor, Nicky Morgan, to review the school building policy, which uses private finance, because it is delivering buildings with worse value for money, higher running costs and of a \u201chighly varied\u201d standard.

Photograph: RIBA    One headmaster, Andrew Seager, at Stratford school academy in east London, has complained about his new building, which was delivered with \u201c700 snagging items and some major defects\u201d and left the school with a \u00a3600,000 bill to complete works to the surrounding grounds.  He told parliament last year it was \u201cthe worst experience I have ever had as a headteacher\u201d and cited the DfE\u2019s unilateral decision to drop from the brief a secure perimeter fence and a canopy to keep children dry in the lunch queue. Jane Duncan, the RIBA president, said: \u201cHow can we expect our children to compete with the world\u2019s best when too many of our school buildings are substandard? \u201cEducational improvements resulting from the current programme of school building are not reaching the basic standards that British taxpayers and our economy expects. We need to do better for all of our children and their hardworking teachers.\u201d RIBA analysed post-occupancy evaluations for 129 new schools and found that many new buildings were over-engineered and on course to cost the taxpayer \u00a3450m more than they should in heating, cooling and lighting between 2015 and 2018 \u2013 outgoings that could be avoided with better design. It found that well-designed schools enjoyed better pupil behaviour and results and a 15% productivity increase among staff. The DfE said: \u201cWe are building schools based on what works in terms of good design \u2013 not so-called iconic buildings that are expensive to maintain. Under the previous programme, Building Schools for the Future, the most expensive schools cost in excess of \u00a345m and took three years for building work to begin. We have cut this to one year ... and the average cost of rebuilding has dropped by a third.\u201d The claims about the latest school building programme follow the closure last month of 17 schools in Edinburgh, built under the private finance initiative, owing to safety fears after a wall collapsed at a primary school. The UK\u2019s largest teaching union, NASUWT, said RIBA\u2019s verdict echoed its own finding that more than a third of teachers surveyed thought their school building was not fit for teachinf, with 40% saying their buildings were not good for pupils. There is growing pressure to build more schools, as almost a million extra pupils are expected to enter the English school system over the next 10 years. But in a 2014 survey of local councils by the Local Government Association, 23% rated the condition of their schools\u2019 estates as extremely or very poor, with more than two-thirds of schools considered in need of refurbishment or renewal. The RIBA report, Better spaces for learning, warned that the \u201cdrive towards greater standardisation has led to the voice of the user being almost completely excluded from the design process\u201d.  It said that the target of reduced floor areas for new schools to reduce costs meant corridors in new schools were sometimes too narrow, which exacerbated overcrowding and discipline problems such as bullying.",
