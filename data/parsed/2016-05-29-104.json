  "body": "After Hillary Clinton won the New York Democratic primary in April, her surrogates began relaying the message: game over, Bernie Sanders. Time to go home. It is mathematically impossible to win the nomination.   Related: Hillary Clinton's week from hell: can she shake off troubles to take on Trump?    Technically, they were right. The rivals may be separated by only 270 pledged delegates, a large but not insurmountable gap, but that figure does not take into account the superdelegates who do not owe allegiance to any vote and almost all of whom \u2013 571 \u2013 are already pledged to Clinton. Nobody appears to have told Sanders. The Vermont senator has set a punishing pace in California: in the last week alone he addressed crowds in National City, Vista, Irvine, Santa Monica, Anaheim, East Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Cathedral City, Lancaster, Ventura, San Pedro, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Pomona, Bakersfield, Fresno and Visalia. Sanders has outspent Clinton on advertising and his ground game is strong; he has more than 55,000 volunteers in the state who have made more than two million phone calls, according to the campaign. His rallies, attended by tens of thousands, sometimes more, certainly don\u2019t feel like those of a losing candidate. His audience hang on his every word, joyously finishing his favoured talking-points. They sport hats, T-shirts and even tattoos of Sanders\u2019 unofficial logo: a silhouette of his unkempt hair and glasses which has become almost as recognizable a totem of the 2016 primary as Donald Trump\u2019s red \u201cmake America great again\u201d hats. Still, the challenge Sanders faces is steep. Even if you allow for a 10-point or greater swing in the California primary on 7 June, the superdelegates mean Clinton would still have enough to clinch the nomination at the convention in July. In fact, because polls close three hours earlier in New Jersey on the same day, Clinton will likely have reached the 2,383 delegates required for the nomination before California\u2019s results even begin to come in. Few attendees at Sanders rallies \u2013 least of all Sanders \u2013 seem the least bit fazed. He is clearly having fun, eagerly accepting Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to debate him, a challenge the Republican hastily walked back, to avoid facing the 74-year-old former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, mano-a-mano. Many Sanders supporters remain convinced he is going to get the nomination, either by a miraculous landslide in California or by convincing superdelegates to switch their support. Others, like Joe Tellez, whom the Guardian spoke to at a Sanders rally earlier this month in a packed 15,000-capacity stadium in Sacramento, are less sure of victory but remain upbeat.  \u201cI think it\u2019s difficult \u2013 that might be true,\u201d Tellez said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy \u2026 but I remain hopeful.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re going to leave it all on the field\u2019 Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, told the Guardian: \u201cWhat [everyone is] missing is that although the secretary [Clinton] has obviously racked up a substantial delegate lead, there is an incredible wellspring of support for the senator and it has not really made it through the process.\u201d Weaver seems confident of a win in California.  \u201cThis kind of intensive campaigning by the senator, it really does move a lot of voters,\u201d he said, pointing to the Michigan primary, which Sanders won despite being 10 points behind just a week before the vote. \u201cHe has the capacity to move voters just by his presence at these large events.\u201d Sanders\u2019 energetic campaigning is certainly paying dividends. Recent polling shows Clinton\u2019s lead in California \u2013 a state she won against Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 is dwindling, with Sanders well within the margin for error, trailing by just 2%. California\u2019s primary is open, which means independents can vote. In other states, such voters have favoured Sanders over Clinton. There have also been 1.5 million new registered voters, many under 30, a demographic Sanders has won elsewhere by enormous margins. The Sanders campaign office in San Diego was having a party on Thursday evening, celebrating a day of canvassing with the actor Rosario Dawson. Volunteers ate cupcakes and crudit\u00e9s, and used a small hand-cranked press to make \u201cBernie 2016\u201d badges. \u201cI\u2019m a goal-oriented person, and the goal is 7 June,\u201d said Carolina Rodriguez, a volunteer from San Diego who has been campaigning for three months. \u201cIf we as California win, we send a message to the rest of the United States \u2026 it\u2019s going to be a huge day, and were going to leave it all on the field.\u201d \u201cI truly believe he can win the nomination,\u201d said Debbie Luna, another volunteer in San Diego. \u201cCalifornia alone has a lot of delegates, he\u2019s not that far behind ... from what we see I truly believe that he will win California by a large amount.\u201d Next to her was Kelly Collison, a single mother from Michigan who was part of the Sanders operation that won the primary there, and had brought her eight-year-old daughter to San Diego to help.  \u201cI have never seen anything like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anyone being this hyped and excited in my lifetime, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d \u2018A largely political argument\u2019     Sanders speaking in Ventura on 26 May. Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images     Related: Sanders wants 'hostile' Barney Frank ousted from convention role    If Sanders\u2019 volunteers share this undimmed hope for victory, they share another trait \u2013 distrust of the mainstream media, which they see as part of an establishment that wants to see Clinton win.  \u201cThe media is bought out by corporate billionaires,\u201d said Luna. \u201cCNN, MSNBC, Fox News \u2013 they\u2019re all contributors to Hillary Clinton.\u201d Unlike Clinton, Luna said, \u201cBernie ... doesn\u2019t get any money from anybody but regular people like us, so they\u2019re not gonna show him on the media, we\u2019re not gonna see him.\u201d  Several volunteers said Sanders supporters aim to get their news from Twitter rather than any traditional media source. Ultimately, the narrow path forward for Sanders \u2013 a path only open at all if he wins big in California \u2013 will come down to convincing superdelegates to switch their allegiance.  \u201cIt would be extremely difficult to surpass [Clinton] in pledged delegates, she has a 270-pledged delegate lead right now,\u201d Weaver said. But he added that what the Sanders campaign could do was \u201cto substantially narrow that lead\u201d. \u201cThis is going to be a largely political argument to be made to the superdelegates,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cAll the polling shows that, at state level and national level, he\u2019s just a stronger general election candidate. It\u2019s not like that there\u2019s a magic [delegate] threshold, but the closer you are, the stronger that argument will be.\u201d  This article was amended on 29 May 2015.
