  "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 winner. That may be the conventional wisdom at Borussia Dortmund, what prompted Fenway Sports Group to upgrade its manager at Liverpool and why the 48-year-old mentions the Europa League final purely in terms of silverware, not as a golden ticket to the Champions League. But winner? The man himself is not entirely convinced. \u201cWinning would mean a nice party,\u201d says Klopp. \u201cAnd I\u2019m quite good at celebrating things. It is long ago that I really celebrated something so I am ready.\u201d The Liverpool manager\u2019s certainty, born of experience at Mainz and Dortmund, is he will fight to the last for every prize on offer. His attitude has been infectious at Anfield, as Thomas Tuchel\u2019s team discovered in the quarter-finals and Sevilla would be well advised to consider in Basel on Wednesday. For Liverpool, the Europa League final presents an opportunity to win the trophy for a fourth time, reaffirm their European status and help their recruitment drive this summer with Champions League football on offer. For their manager, it is one final demand that players give him everything in the 52nd match of his seven-month reign.   Related: J\u00fcrgen Klopp says team in \u2018perfect moment\u2019 to become Liverpool legends    \u201cIf you look at my career as a manager until now you can say that each season was very exciting until the last match,\u201d Klopp explains. \u201cStaying in the league in the first year [with Mainz] \u2013 last day. Not getting promoted in the second year \u2013 last day. Not getting promoted next year \u2013 last day. Getting promoted \u2013 last matchday. Not getting in the Europa League with Dortmund \u2013 last matchday. Qualifying for the Europa League \u2013 last matchday. We became Bundesliga champions three games before the end but we had finals in the last four years always until the end. \u201cI stayed in the race until the end. Sometimes I thought: \u2018My God, everyone else is already on holiday, they have had four weeks and I\u2019m still going nuts.\u2019 But that is the truth. I try to get everything. When I sleep, I sleep. When I\u2019m not I\u2019m really awake. I try to push everything I can to get everything I can get. That is why we had finals in the last few years.\u201d Finals, but not always victories \u2013 hence Klopp\u2019s unease with the winner\u2019s mantle. His past four finals have ended in defeat: the 2016 Capital One Cup final, the 2015 German Cup final, the 2014 German Cup final and the 2013 Champions League final. It is a record the Liverpool manager brings up voluntarily as he explains why Unai Emery\u2019s holders hold no fear for his team. \u201cSomeone will mention it, someone will write it that I didn\u2019t win too much,\u201d Klopp adds. \u201cThat is the truth but very often I was in a final against a team that is actually a little bit better. The performance was always good though. We got to the final because we were overperforming and then you have the best team against you and think: \u2018Oh my God, that is quite difficult.\u2019 But even then we played our best and were really competitive like the Champions League final. \u201cNow Sevilla is a really good side but they are not better than we are. It is not like Sevilla are up there and we are here [raises one hand up, lowers the other] and we have to bring them back down with some tactical movements. No! [Bangs his fist] If we play our best it is quite difficult for every team to play against us, especially to beat us. I\u2019m not sure if I am a winner, but I want to win. Really. I had to learn in my life to accept defeats. It doesn\u2019t feel too good. You could say it is better to go out in the semi-final so it doesn\u2019t hurt so much if you lose the final but being in the final is the opportunity. That is why we are here.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s appetite to redress past disappointments against Sevilla extends from manager to players. February\u2019s shootout defeat by Manchester City in the Capital One Cup final, and the lessons from it, has been a recurring theme from Liverpool\u2019s players in the buildup to the Europa League final. James Milner\u2019s grievances run deeper. The Liverpool midfielder, a hugely important figure in the run to Basel, was on the bench for three cup finals during his time with City and deployed in only one, the shock 2013 FA Cup final defeat by Wigan Athletic.   Related: The secret behind Sevilla\u2019s success? Meet Monchi, the transfer wizard    \u201cThe one that stung me the most was when we had won the trophy and the manager came up to me and said: \u2018I should have played you,\u2019 but he never did,\u201d admits Milner, who will be more than happy for Jordan Henderson to lift the trophy on Wednesday should he captain the side in his fellow midfielder\u2019s possible absence. \u201cI thought that was a bit pointless; I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re supposed to do with that. That one probably hurt me the most, but I\u2019m not going to say who it was. But you don\u2019t win trophies as individuals, you win them as a team. Even though you want to play in a final, and it is frustrating when you don\u2019t, ultimately it is about the team.\u201d He adds: \u201cI\u2019m desperate to add to the list of trophies that have been won at this football club. The funny thing is that I don\u2019t think any of us have really thought about the Champions League. It\u2019s all about winning that trophy. You walk into the reception at Melwood and all the honours are listed there. I want to ensure the club has to get someone in over the summer to change that number.\u201d Milner sees comparisons between Klopp\u2019s Liverpool and the start of silverware arriving at City but his manager insists the Europa League final cannot be viewed as a defining moment for his Anfield tenure or his team. \u201cIt is important,\u201d says Klopp. \u201cBut if someone thinks if we win the final then everything will be wonderful in the future then come on \u2026 it is only one title and then next year we have to go on. If somebody thinks if we don\u2019t win then everything is rubbish from now on then what can I say? It is a game. If you make the pressure that big how can you move in the game? How can you walk? It is hard to breathe. \u201cIt is still a football game. If you want to get to the highest level then you need to be ready to fall really deep. It is a big opportunity. It is a big chance but it is not the last chance in our life. We are only going to Basel to win this trophy. The bad news is that Sevilla will have quite the same plan. That is football. Let\u2019s go.\u201d",
