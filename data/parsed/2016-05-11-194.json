Related: Why 'hardworking people' are at the heart of Conservative mythmaking | Richard Seymour    Like any myth, this has a political purpose. Point towards the cost of welfare as the source of Britain\u2019s \u2013 and your family\u2019s \u2013 problems and it conveniently distracts from the government\u2019s failure over low wages, housing, and a stalling economy. Convince the electorate to be suspicious of the people who appear to need help and it is easier to cut the benefits of cancer patients and paraplegics. What happens, then, if it turns out there are large groups of people who \u2013 rather than relishing \u201cbeing on welfare\u201d \u2013 don\u2019t claim their benefits? Almost half of families on low incomes aren\u2019t taking up the benefits they could be entitled to, according to research released today by the charity Turn2us. Some families don\u2019t understand they are eligible, while others are unsure of how to get help or where to go for it. A quarter of disabled people said recent benefit changes \u2013 think tightened criteria for personal independence payments or the infamous work capability assessment \u2013 meant it was simply too difficult for them to apply for support. If any of that comes as a surprise, there\u2019s a reason. When it comes to welfare, the government takes great enthusiasm in talking in billions \u2013 whether that\u2019s repeated references to the size of the benefits bill or anchoring its very election in the promise to hack \u00a312bn off it. We hear considerably less about another number: the \u00a313bn in benefits that are going unclaimed each year. This is not spare change left by the wealthy. It\u2019s the unclaimed housing benefit of people struggling to pay the rent, and unclaimed employment and support allowance meant to provide an income for people too ill or disabled to work.   Related: Personal independence payments are a punishment of the poor and ill | Polly Toynbee    Almost half of unemployed people who can receive jobseeker\u2019s allowance \u2013 the antithesis of George Osborne\u2019s \u201chardworking people\u201d \u2013 don\u2019t take their benefit. Fall straight in to rightwing rhetoric and these are the \u201cgood\u201d benefit citizens: the ones who, despite the supposedly ever generous benefit system making them eligible, have resisted becoming claimants. Indeed, they\u2019re going hungry for it. Nearly a third of the people surveyed told Turn2Us they\u2019d cut back on food rather than apply for benefits. Almost 40% would cut back on gas and electricity. Previous research by the same charity and the University of Kent found people were choosing between heating or eating because they were too ashamed to make a benefits claim. There should be no celebration in that. That billions of pounds of benefits are going unclaimed doesn\u2019t mean the need for them has magically disappeared. It simply means hundreds of thousands of people \u2013 often living without the advantages of good education, stable work, and secure housing \u2013 aren\u2019t getting the minimal help they\u2019re entitled to. It means the reputation of the welfare state has been stigmatised to the extent that some families would actually prefer to be cold and hungry than use the safety net their taxes have paid for. In the next six months, the Conservatives will swing two more hammer blows to social security. First, the rolling out of universal credit \u2013 gutting billions of pounds from the support for people struggling on low wages. Second, a lower household benefit cap, which means many families on benefits \u2013 largely single mothers \u2013 will lose \u00a36,000 a year. Last week Stephen Crabb, the work and pensions secretary, warned such families to look for work \u201cnow\u201d, as if all that is standing between them and employment is a tough lesson in personal responsibility, and as if they don\u2019t rely on the benefits to house, feed, and clothe their children. People are out for whatever they can get. Social security isn\u2019t really needed: the Big Benefits Myth is only just beginning.",
