  "body": "The New York state Libertarian party convention was held in New York City on Saturday. It started at 10am. It grew lively at noon, the hour John McAfee showed up. The anti-virus software mogul and one-time international fugitive had turned into a presidential hopeful, and he arrived at the convention dressed like an ageing rocker: blond streaks in his hair, aviator sunglasses hooked into the neck of his white T-shirt and a flamboyant paisley scarf draped around his neck. McAfee, who infamously went on the run from Belize police in 2012 after being named as a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in a murder case, would later tell the Guardian he never went out at night for fear that the government of Belize might try to \u201cwhack\u201d him.  That threat aside, the 70-year-old seemed to be enjoying himself as he overshadowed the rest of Libertarian party nominees at the convention in the East Village. He was in the city to debate his fellow hopefuls, including the party\u2019s 2012 candidate, Gary Johnson.  Johnson achieved the party\u2019s best-ever election result last time round, winning 1.2m votes \u2013 0.99% of the vote nationally. He\u2019s a popular man. But there was no doubting who was the star on Saturday.  Rather than immediately enter the convention \u2013 held in the back room of the restaurant \u2013 McAfee posted up outside, having his photograph taken with Libertarians and passersby, smoking cigarettes and acting up for the four-person film crew he had arrived with.   Related: John McAfee: 'Bad people are still after me'    He is being filmed for a series on Spy TV, and he seemed to be enjoying the attention. He chatted into the camera, he laughed into the camera, he came up close to the lens and stuck his tongue out at the camera. It was all well and good until the camerawoman misjudged one of McAfee\u2019s playful lunges and smacked him in the mouth with the camera lens. The 70-year-old checked his teeth in the window of a nearby swimwear store. No permanent damage. McAfee was best known for his eponymous software until 2012, when he went on the run from Belize. Police had wanted to question him in relation to the death of a neighbor, but were never able to, as McAfee made it back to the US. Four years after the incident, even in the middle of a presidential campaign, he is adamant that there is a constant threat to his life. \u201cThe government of Belize I shamed, I humiliated, I cost them a ton of money in terms of tourist travel,\u201d he said.  \u201cThey want me to shut the fuck up about this, which I will not do and I have not. So if you think a corrupt government run by the Sinaloa cartel is not willing to whack an American citizen, then you need to bone up on the Sinaloa cartel.\u201d McAfee said he did not feel under threat during the conversation \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s daytime; there\u2019s a lot of people around. No one\u2019s going to do anything\u201d \u2013 but said he never felt safe. \u201cI don\u2019t go out at night,\u201d he said. \u201cEver. Anywhere.\u201d McAfee argued that he should be president because only he has the skills to address the problem of internet security. He referred to \u201cthe imminent collapse of our nation due to the fact that we are 20 years behind much of the rest of the world in cybersecurity.\u201d \u201cI will win,\u201d McAfee added. \u201cI would win the general election. Because I know who I am, I know my talents, and I know what my limits are. And I\u2019ve been around long enough to know people\u2019s minds.\u201d     John McAfee was deported from Guatemala and returned to Miami in 2013. Photograph: Zuma/Rex Shutterstock    McAfee began his debate performance with an unorthodox opening statement: \u201cI don\u2019t have a statement prepared.\u201d \u201cI am unprepared for everything, always,\u201d he added, \u201cso I\u2019m not going to waste your time.\u201d He sat back down. He had used 30 seconds of his allotted two minutes. The others had prepared. Johnson, a two-term governor of New Mexico and seemingly the best qualified to be the 2016 nominee, set out his plan for what the Libertarian party needed to do to move beyond the role of quirky outsider: join presidential debates.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the presidential debates, you\u2019re not going to win. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Johnson told the Guardian. In 2000, the commission on presidential debates decided that a party or candidate would only be allowed to participate if they received 15% support or more across five national polls. Johnson and the Libertarian party have only crossed that threshold in one poll so far. \u201cA month ago, I was in my first and only national poll, and I was at 11% against Trump and Clinton,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf my name were in the polls, given the polarizing nature of this race, I will be at 15%, which will get me into the debates.\u201d   Related: Tech veteran John McAfee to join 2016 US presidential race as independent    To that end, he has pressed polling firms to include him in more surveys. He has also filed a lawsuit, along with the Green party, against the commission on presidential debates.  Johnson also expressed, with frustration, his belief that \u201cmost people\u201d are libertarian but just don\u2019t know it. During the debate and in conversation, he repeatedly referred to the website isidewith.com, which asks users to take a quiz to find out which presidential candidates they are most aligned with. \u201cIf everybody would take that quiz [to] find out who you align with, I think most people will be libertarian,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best sales tool I can think of, and what I tell people is: \u2018Take the quiz\u2019.\u201d Johnson has taken the quiz.  \u201cOutside of the other Libertarians running for president, the next presidential candidate that I most align with is Bernie Sanders, at 73% [aligned]. Which I found to be really revealing. \u201cOn the social side, marriage equality, marijuana legalization, crony capitalism, military interventions, we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d After the debate, Johnson and others hung around to chat and shake hands. But McAfee had had enough. He jumped up and marched out, his film crew scurrying behind him. He seemed to have lost some of his rock star pizzazz. \u201cI\u2019m 70 years old, and I\u2019ve been talking all day.\u201d Asked what he thought of the debate, he said: \u201cIt was boring, as all debates are, and utter nonsense. He said he planned \u201cto rest as much as possible\u201d before the party\u2019s national convention at the end of May in Orlando, Florida. Then he returned to his hotel, camera crew in tow, presumably not to emerge until the next break of day.",
