  "body": "The howls of annoyance and frustration from children\u2019s authors could probably be heard across the land this morning with the news that pop mogul and Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge Simon Cowell is planning to write a children\u2019s book. And what\u2019s wrong with that? Plenty of celebs have given children\u2019s book writing a whirl, with varying degrees of success (stand up Cowell\u2019s fellow judge multiple bestseller David Walliams). But they tend not to start off by alienating everybody else in the field. \u201cI have thought about it, and now I think I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Cowell told ex-girlfriend Terri Seymour during an interview for US news show Extra. \u201cIt will be about animals... I\u2019ve had to read a lot of these children\u2019s books and they\u2019re quite boring, I think I could do it better.\u201d   Related: How to draw\u2026 a squirrel    Now, there\u2019s lots we could say about his comments. Some of it\u2019s even printable. But, no. We\u2019re going to give Cowell the benefit of the doubt and simply assume that he\u2019s not had time to delve into the Guardian children\u2019s books site (or even his local independent bookshop or library) to discover the riches of the animal-based literature on offer. So, in the spirit of positive re-education, here are some of our suggestions for Cowell (and his son). We\u2019d love to hear your recommendations too.     Posting without comment. pic.twitter.com/XRyhhjSmlM\u2014 Sam Missingham (@samatlounge) May 24, 2016    As Cowell\u2019s son is two, let\u2019s kick off with a few picture book suggestions, all animal-based, of course. Chris Haughton\u2019s books are not only gorgeous to look at but also capture so many layers of meaning and humour in so few words. Try A Bit Lost (owls, a squirrel and a frog) and Oh No George (a dog). Ed Vere\u2019s Max the Brave is a delightful story of a brave little kitten who chases mice (if he can work out what that elusive mouse looks like). Even if he doesn\u2019t patronise his local library much, Cowell can\u2019t have failed to come across Judith Kerr\u2019s fabulous Mog via the Sainsbury\u2019s Christmas ad.      Ed Vere\u2019s brave little kitten Max in Max at Night. Photograph: Ed Vere    Perhaps Cowell\u2019s son is lucky enough to have a pet dog. In which case, he (and his dad) are bound to appreciate Shirley Hughes\u2019s classic Dogger, Mick Inkpen\u2019s Kipper (or his book with his daughter Chloe, I Will Love You Anyway, about a hapless runaway dog), Jez Alborough\u2019s Some Dogs Do or Babette Cole\u2019s Doctor Dog. There\u2019s no shortage of books about bears, of course. If classics such as Winnie-the-Pooh and Paddington Bear don\u2019t meet Cowell\u2019s high standards, then he might enjoy Jon Klassen\u2019s wonderful I Want My Hat Back, depicting a bear-eat-rabbit world. The Bumblebear by Nadia Shireen, has just been published and is a hilarious tale of a honey-loving bear who disguises himself as a bee to get easier access to the sweet sticky stuff.    Related: How I made Wolves by Emily Gravett \u2013 in pictures    If Cowell wants to keep it simple, he could stick to one, fabulous author-illustrator, for a wide range of brilliant animal-based books. I\u2019m thinking Emily Gravett - try Wolves, Dogs, Little Mouse\u2019s Big Book of Fears, Meerkat Mail or, most recently, Tidy.  But maybe all these animals are just far too tame for Cowell. Is he simply lacking some Gruffalo in his life? What do you think? Take part in the Cowell re-education programme by suggesting the animal-based books you think he\u2019s missing out on. Who knows, we might even save him the bother of writing his own if he realises how many not-boring books are already out there...
