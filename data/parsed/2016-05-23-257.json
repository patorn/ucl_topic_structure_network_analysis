  "body": "Elijah Wood, the actor who took his first film role aged eight before starring in the Lord of the Rings movies, has said that organised sexual abuse of children in Hollywood is rife.  Speaking to the Sunday Times, Wood said that although he had been protected as a child \u2013 mainly through the efforts of his mother, who stopped him going to parties \u2013 many of his peers were regularly \u201cpreyed upon\u201d. Wood, now 35, drew parallels between such experiences and the prolific sexual abuse perpetrated by TV host Jimmy Savile. \u201cYou all grew up with Savile,\u201d said Wood. \u201cJesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organised. There are a lot of vipers in this industry \u2013 people who only have their own interests in mind.\u201d \u201cThere is darkness in the underbelly,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you can imagine it, it\u2019s probably happened.\u201d  The actor said he felt that such crimes continue to be unpunished because the victims \u201ccan\u2019t speak as loudly as people in power\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the tragedy of attempting to reveal what is happening to innocent people. They can be squashed, but their lives have been irreparably damaged.\u201d   Related: Producer of abuse documentary An Open Secret taking director to court    Allegations against senior figures in Hollywood have increased in recent years. Last year, Amy Berg\u2019s documentary An Open Secret alleged similar levels of collusion over child molestation in the film industry. In 2012, the actor Corey Feldman spoke out about the threat he felt in the 1980s, saying he was \u201csurrounded\u201d by abusers, with around 15 older men \u201cleching around like vultures\u201d. Bizparentz, a group founded to help child actors, claims around 100 active abusers are currently being sheltered, and says a \u201ctsunami\u201d of cases is pending.",
