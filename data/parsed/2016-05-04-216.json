  "body": "When I was 10 or 11, I was consumed by a passion for Golden Age detective fiction. I browsed mildew-smelling secondhand bookshops for Dorothy L Sayers and Arthur Conan Doyle, developing secret proto-crushes on both Lord Peter Wimsey and Sherlock Holmes (and wishing I could carry off a monocle). I burned through Margery Allingham\u2019s Albert Campion books, and Agatha Christies by the score and I adored GK Chesterton\u2019s Father Brown. But recently, rereading the stories of the round-faced, stumpy cleric, with his flapping black cassock and his encyclopedic knowledge of human evil, left me feeling cold rather than cosy. Chesterton\u2019s glorious evocations of light, landscape, and unnerving, lurid strangeness remain compelling. But his frequent use of racial stereotypes now slams me repeatedly out of his text. References to \u201cthe yellow man\u201d, \u201ca big white bulk \u2026 but with the needless emphasis of a black face\u201d, \u201cthe fashionable negro \u2026 showing his apish teeth\u201d \u2013 even the intrinsic evil of a \u201cTurkey carpet\u201d \u2013 leave me feeling that the padre\u2019s much-touted broad-mindedness boils down all too often to mere mistrust of any skin-shade other than white. Naturally, none of the Golden Agers is perfect in this respect, reflecting the narrow attitudes of the eras in which they wrote \u2013 as the original title of Agatha Christie\u2019s And Then There Were None can testify. But the peculiar dislike of brown-skinned \u201cotherness\u201d I now detect in Chesterton\u2019s stories has made it impossible for me to relax into the weird beauty of his landscapes. Sherlock Holmes has his distasteful moments, too \u2013 the caricature treatment of Steve Dixie, the boxer and former slave in The Adventure of the Three Gables, leaves a particularly nasty taste in the mouth \u2013 but Conan Doyle\u2019s humane treatment of the idea of interracial marriage in The Adventure of the Yellow Face at least provides some leavening and balance. I am still fond of Sherlock, but I\u2019ve had to bid farewell to Father Brown. Later, as a teen sci-fi addict frequently annoyed by the treatment of women as irrational, disposable, decorative or all three, I loved Sheri S Tepper\u2019s The Gate to Women\u2019s Country. This is a post-apocalyptic story set in Marthatown, an ecofeminist utopia, and its environs, including the warriors\u2019 garrison outside its walls. On first reading, I fell in love with the idea of a place where all the inhabitants had a job, an art, and a craft, which they worked on and refined throughout their lives. And the choice at the heart of the story \u2013 that boys born in Women\u2019s Country, sent out to the garrison as children, must decide as teenagers whether to return or to renounce their mothers and remain with the warriors \u2013 was dramatic enough to grip me from the outset. But my later rereading brought some unsavoury details into focus: the selective breeding practised by the matriarchs of Women\u2019s Country, with its tang of eugenics; the eradication of the \u201cgay syndrome\u201d by this means; the denigration of the heroine\u2019s sister as \u201ccoming from an unsatisfactory sire\u201d \u2026 I still love the starkness of that irrevocable central choice, and yearn for some elements of the Marthatown municipality, but I can no longer sink blissfully into the book, seeking paradise. Last year, Katy, Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s masterful re-imagining of What Katy Did, sent me back to Susan Coolidge\u2019s original, searching in vain for the delight it gave me as a child. While I still love the detailed evocation of the large, lovingly chaotic Carr family, the heavy lacing of moral guidance and the \u201csmoothing away\u201d of disability at the end \u2013 like the lines of pain that Cousin Helen smooths away from her forehead \u201cwith her fingers\u201d \u2013 has dated dreadfully. The idea of a wheelchair-using child reading this book, and thinking that if only they were cheerful and dutiful enough, perhaps they might be cured, makes me want to sweep it off the shelves.",
