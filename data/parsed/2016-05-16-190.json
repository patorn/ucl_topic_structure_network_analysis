  "body": "With the premieres of works such as Elgar\u2019s Sea Pictures, Vaughan Williams\u2019s Job and Britten\u2019s Our Hunting Fathers among its last-century credits, the Norfolk and Norwich festival has a distinguished history of commissioning new works. It\u2019s a tradition the festival is attempting to revive. The first product of that intent was the premiere of Kemal Yusuf\u2019s Cain, which was the centrepiece of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra\u2019s concert at this year\u2019s festival, conducted by David Parry. Yusuf tells the fable of the Old Testament\u2019s first murder and its consequences as a half-hour cantata. Matthew Monaghan\u2019s text presents it in five compact parts, with solo roles for Cain (baritone Alexander Robin Baker), Abel (tenor Christopher Diffey) and their mother Eve (soprano Jeni Bern); the chorus (the festival\u2019s own) functions as both terse narrator and the voice of God. Yet it is all so schematic that none of the characters are explored in any depth, not even Cain himself. The vocal lines are declamatory rather than expressive, and Yusuf punctuates the text with flamboyant orchestral gestures that sounded drastically over-scored in the St Andrew\u2019s Hall acoustic; far too few of them made a convincing dramatic point, or showed real musical purpose. Parry ended the concert with C\u00e9sar Franck\u2019s D minor Symphony. It had begun with what proved to be the highlight of the evening: an account of Chausson\u2019s Po\u00e8me for violin and orchestra, in which Savitri Grier was the wonderfully assured and lyrically poised soloist. \u2022 The Norfolk and Norwich festival continues until 29 May. Box office: 01603 766400.",
