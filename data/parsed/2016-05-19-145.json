  "body": "It hath long been decreed that whensoever two or more Britons shall gather together in Los Angeles, the talk shall soon enough turn ... to Marmite. Or in Kate Beckinsale\u2019s case, \u201cMarmite characters\u201d, such as her lead role, the delightfully daunting Lady Susan, in Whit Stillman\u2019s sprightly Jane Austen adaptation Love and Friendship. \u201cI was at the end of a long day of interviews once and I found myself deep in a Marmite conversation with an American journalist. Impossible to describe it to them because they think it tastes like motor oil. Some of my characters \u2013 the ones I like playing \u2013 are like Marmite in that you either really love the character or you just can\u2019t stand them. It turns out Lady Susan may be slightly less Marmitey than I thought, because people are really falling in love with her.\u201d She\u2019s not wrong. Love and Friendship is reaching an audience delighted to find Stillman simultaneously moving into period costume drama and literary adaptation, while retaining that familiar whiff of \u201cdoomed bourgeois in love\u201d that is the trademark of his other brittle comedies of manners. Lady Susan is the titular heroine of an Austen fragment, a 60-page epistolary novella that went unpublished in her lifetime, to which Stillman has appended the title of another scrap of Austen marginalia, the story Love and Friendship. Widowed with a marriageable daughter, Lady Susan is country society\u2019s most dreaded houseguest, ever swanning into drawing rooms filled with people determined not to be swept up in her schemes. Beckinsale \u2013 more familiar to us of late as the tooled-up super-heroine of the Underworld vampire franchise \u2013 reminds us again what a subtle and delicate performer she has always been, giving us a Lady Susan whose desperation to find good husbands for herself and her child is mixed with a beguiling slyness and cast-iron self-assurance. Beckinsale is right \u2013 you do end up loving her. It\u2019s a real tightrope performance.     As Lady Susan in Love and Friendship. Photograph: Courte/Rex/Shutterstock    \u201cReading the novella and the script, you feel she could go either way,\u201d says Beckinsale. \u201cThe thing that you can\u2019t be trying for in a part like this is likability, with her being so ruthless and selfish. But in that period, when the constraints on women were so intense, it makes you cheer her on, in spite of her manipulations and schemes.\u201d It\u2019s a unique Austen adaptation, in that Lady Susan has never before been filmed, which means the field is clear for all the actors. At the beginning of her career, Beckinsale faced this issue head-on when she played Emma in an ITV adaptation soon after the movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow was released \u2013 and Beckinsale got the better notices. \u201cThat was the amazing thing, realising that no one has ever played these parts \u2013 and it\u2019s Austen. Who gets to say that about her novels?\u201d The adaptation also dovetails perfectly with the drily ironic, slightly repressed Stillman worldview. Beckinsale puts this down to the fact that the aristocratic, lineage-back-to-the-Mayflower, New England, Ivy League Stillman is perhaps more like Britons than most Americans are.            \u201cHe\u2019s very much a kind of curate\u2019s egg. He\u2019s sort of Waspy, terribly well educated, very cultured, sort of diffident. He has a throwaway humour that is quietly very hilarious. It\u2019s quite sort of ... British, I suppose. But it\u2019s not like he\u2019s a raging Anglophile. He\u2019s just one of those Americans who has been around a bit, but there\u2019s still a quintessential Americanness to him. He\u2019s incredibly elegant and occasionally louche at the same time. But what I\u2019d forgotten from Last Days of Disco was that he really is incredibly prepared. But he\u2019s also very, very responsive to the day, the moment, so he is going to change things at the last minute, when he heaves into view in his corduroy jacket brandishing new pages. \u201cOnly a few things ...\u201d I feel if I ever don\u2019t get Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019ll be all because of Whit!\u201d We\u2019re meeting at Soho House in West Hollywood, the uppermost two floors of a 12-storey building on Sunset Boulevard affording us unsurpassable views of LA all the way to the ocean (and of Quentin Tarantino having dinner). Looking paler and with more more peaches and cream in her complexion than her more often suntanned onscreen self, Beckinsale is slender, tall, effortlessly graceful, yet very approachable. She has lived in LA, off and on, for 12 years, her residency dictated by pragmatism: Lily, her daughter with actor Michael Sheen, decided, aged 11 \u2013 having undergone a bi-continental education early on \u2013 that she wanted one more school only, the one in LA. \u201cShe was concurrently in two schools, in London and here, which is great \u2013 two sets of mates and experiences. But, after about 11, that can threaten to produce a very weird kid. And chances are, being as how Michael and I are, that she\u2019s going to be tipping at the weirder end of the scale anyway. We had to make the decision that from 11 to 16 she could stay here \u2013 or she made it, really.\u201d     As Selene in Underworld: Awakening. Photograph: Allstar/Screen Gems/Sportsphoto Ltd    It\u2019s a world away from the reflexively anti-American feelings generated 20 years ago when actors moved from London to LA. \u201cThat was a time when any British actor coming out to LA was a highly suspicious character. It made you seem insanely ambitious, like a perfectly obvious character flaw. It was a real prejudice 20 years ago and I think I hit it right at its peak. But evidently I was very ahead of my trendy game in coming over here that early, because now everyone\u2019s here and it\u2019s perfectly normal. I think the person who got it the worst was Catherine Zeta-Jones. Everyone was like, oh, what is she doing \u2013 she must be such a shark! And I don\u2019t know her at all, but I know none of that was fair to her. Nowadays it\u2019s really not such a stretch, in London, to imagine what being in LA might be like. The point is, if you\u2019re going to be an arsehole in London, you\u2019re going to be an arsehole in LA, too.\u201d   Related: Chlo\u00eb Sevigny: \u2018I now have total disdain for directors\u2019    Famously, she is the daughter of the beloved actor Richard Beckinsale, of Porridge and Rising Damp fame, who died suddenly in 1979 aged only 31, when Kate was five. She is visibly touched when I tell her how special he was to me then. \u201cIn America, that is a lovely thing to hear, because my father was never known over here. Back home, there was a sense of not only nepotism, but also, because he died so young, my name had only ever appeared in the media alongside the word \u2018tragic\u2019. I very rarely get called \u2018tragic\u2019 over here!\u201d Five years later, her mother married the TV director Roy Battersby, and Kate found herself cast into a house full of Battersby\u2019s four sons, and actors, and above all, political activists from the Workers\u2019 Revolutionary party, the tiny Trotskyist groupuscule with which her stepfather was so deeply involved that he was blacklisted by the BBC. \u201c\u2018Shortly after being blacklisted by the BBC ...\u2019\u201d she intones. \u201cI mean, it has the same anachronistic ring to it as \u2018shortly after being jailed for homosexuality\u2019.\u201d The house teemed with ardent Trots, in the years when it still seemed it was almost impossible to be too leftwing. The WRP was headed by the notorious Mr Toad lookalike Gerry Healy \u2013 \u201cNo, really, he was around the house all the time!\u201d laughs Beckinsale, clearly delighted that I have uncovered this colourful back room of her life. WRP acolytes such as Vanessa and Corin Redgrave were often around, and the cream of top 70s and 80s Beeb lefties were family friends: legendary producer Kenith Trodd, Ken Loach, producer Tony Garnett, plus \u201cvery solid Shakespearean actors\u201d, miners, Palestinian activists, trades union bigwigs and shop stewards. \u201cWe were selling our Trotskyist newspaper, Newsline, on the streets as kids, things like that.\u201d     With Chlo\u00eb Sevigny in Love and Friendship.    \u201cRoy did a documentary called The Palestinian with Vanessa Redgrave, and consequently our phones were tapped growing up. After he was blacklisted by the BBC, me and my girlfriends would be on the phone talking, you know \u201cbum, willy, fanny\u201d, and we\u2019d hear the little click on the phone as the listener came on. And you can imagine some spook somewhere trying to crack the \u201cbum-willy-fanny\u201d code!\u201d Next, she returns to the Underworld franchise that has made her world famous in spite of consistently middling reviews. It\u2019s the last kind of fame she ever expected. \u201cI was so anxious to not pigeonhole myself that I ended up pigeonholing myself in the place that was furthest outside my comfort zone. So odd. I accepted it on the basis that it would be terrifying and therefore I should probably do it. And, by the sequel, I had just got married [to Underworld director Len Wiseman], and when you\u2019re married to a director, they\u2019re stuck making a single movie for up to two years, and it\u2019s insanely disruptive to family life. So at least we could prolong that feeling of family togetherness. There are quite a lot of strong factors like that going into it. Being famous for anything is quite peculiar, but being famous for the thing that is the least your sensibility is really fucking peculiar.\u201d As Lady Susan herself might phrase it. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2016 to remove a reference to Quentin Tarantino\u2019s appearance. This article was further amended on 20 May 2016 because the adaptation of Emma was by ITV, not the BBC as an earlier version said. The article also said her father, Richard Beckinsale, died in 1978 aged 33. This has been corrected to say that he died in 1979, aged 31.",
