  "body": "Winter may finally have thawed, sending us warily out into the scattered sunlight, but this week\u2019s DVD slate is an unseasonably interior affair \u2013 led by a pair of literal chamber pieces. In The Hateful Eight (EIV, 18), Agatha Christie proves an unexpected addition to Quentin Tarantino\u2019s long list of pop-thriller influences. Cramming its crusty ensemble of rogues in a snowbound Wyoming log cabin for the better part of three long hours, this bounty-hunter face-off amounts to a pressure cooker of post-civil war tension and resentment. As tangled backstories of vengeance and violation emerge between the eponymous octet of gunslingers, it\u2019s obvious that few will survive this cosy deathtrap. The game is in what order and formation they\u2019ll fall. Tarantino, for his part, doesn\u2019t seem that invested in the outcome: this ugly cat\u2019s cradle of murderous agendas serves as a mere hanging structure for his trademark bursts of extreme violence and extravagant verbiage. Tarantino cannot under-deliver in those departments, but this nonetheless feels stiff and passionless by his standards. Shot in gleaming 70mm Panavision and scored to shivering, Oscar-winning effect by Ennio Morricone, the film elegantly exposes bloody reserves of American social and racial prejudice, and is too enamoured of its own lustrous cinematic surface to probe them.    It\u2019s hard to turn away from Kristen Wiig\u2019s gutsy, last-nerve performance as a manic-depressive hermit    It\u2019s no spoiler to reveal that Room (StudioCanal, 15), Lenny Abrahamson and Emma Donoghue\u2019s effectively heart-clutching adaptation of the latter\u2019s Booker-shortlisted bestseller, leaves the confines of its four-walled purgatory sooner than Tarantino\u2019s claustrophobic epic. The trick of novel and film alike, however, is that it deftly escapes from one prison to another, expanded and contracted by the psychology of those who inhabit it \u2013 chiefly, the addled, raddled interior of Brie Larson\u2019s Joy, a teenage victim of abduction and rape who comes to live only for the child she never chose to have.     \u2018A remarkable, often wrenching performance\u2019: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay in Room.    Donoghue\u2019s novel was inspired by the Josef Fritzl case, but eschewed lurid criminal detail, instead taking the perspective of Joy\u2019s five-year-old son, Jack \u2013 played here with canny emotional urgency by Canadian newcomer Jacob Tremblay. Despite some stray attempts with voiceover, the film can\u2019t quite replicate his rapt, stunted point of view; instead, it works best as a concentrated two-hander, with cinematographer Danny Cohen cornering Larson and Tremblay so tightly you can practically feel their breath on each other\u2019s faces. It\u2019s a remarkable, often wrenching, two-headed performance: Larson\u2019s best actress Oscar was hard earned, but the lack of corresponding recognition for Tremblay\u2019s fevered, alert co-playing hardly seems fair. If you\u2019re seeking lighter relief, you won\u2019t find it in A War (StudioCanal, 15), Danish director Tobias Lindholm\u2019s excellent investigation of an Afghanistan war commander on trial for accidental civilian fatalities \u2013 braided with a keenly observed war-at-home study of his wife\u2019s domestic exhaustion. Lindholm, previously responsible for the Captain Phillips-predating pirate drama A Hijacking, is a rare film-maker indeed, one whose surging humanity never disrupts the quiet composure of his gaze. Composure isn\u2019t a strong suit of Welcome to Me (Precision Pictures, 15), a darkly jovial reality-TV satire that keeps trying comic tones on for size. Still, it\u2019s hard to turn away from Kristen Wiig\u2019s gutsy, last-nerve performance as a manic-depressive hermit financing her own chat show with a lottery windfall. On the documentary front, Amy Berg\u2019s Janis: Little Girl Blue (Dogwoof, 15) is the top DVD option. A conventionally constructed but engrossing account of Kozmic Blues queen Janis Joplin\u2019s tragically condensed rise and fall, it injects fresh perspective into a known downward spiral via extensive incorporation of Joplin\u2019s personal correspondence \u2013 liltingly voiced by Cat Power. Netflix, meanwhile, has a solemn corker on offer in Welcome to Leith, a stark, frightening community portrait of a one-horse town in North Dakota that unwittingly becomes a congregation point for toxic white-supremacist factions. Directors Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K Walker calmly tease out the agitation and terror felt by a population invaded by politics not their own. Against what is shaping up to be an aggressively polarised US presidential election, this is riveting viewing.",
