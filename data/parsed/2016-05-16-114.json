  "body": "As wife of Canada\u2019s rather popular prime minister, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau has no official duties \u2013 nor a formal job of any kind \u2013 yet she claims to be so swamped with demands on her time that, even with her own assistant, she can\u2019t cope. \u201cI\u2019d like to be everywhere, but I can\u2019t,\u201d Trudeau, a mother of three young children, told Le Soleil. \u201cI need a team to help me serve the people.\u201d Political enemies say that complaining about her staff puts Trudeau out of touch with \u201cthe reality that Canadian women face\u201d, but is that fair? It depends which other first ladies and husbands you compare her with \u2026 US: 24 staff First ladies are basically surrogate royals in the US, which has a formal office of the first lady and a staff to match. Michelle Obama currently performs the function with the help of 24 people (at least when the number was counted in 2009). This is large, but not remarkable. Laura Bush had a staff of at least 24. Hillary Clinton had 20, plus 15 interns and volunteers. UK: one (controversially)     Samantha Cameron used public money to hire a \u2018special adviser\u2019. Photograph: Danny E Martindale/Getty Images    Britain has its own royal family, of course, so our prime ministers\u2019 wives (and husband) have tended to stay out of the way, except when it comes to hosting official functions. Whether this justifies Samantha Cameron using public money to hire first Isabel Spearman and then Rosie Lyburn as her \u201cspecial adviser\u201d is a matter of debate \u2013 especially if their main duties really are assembling her wardrobe, as some claim. Germany: zero (that we know of) If you think it\u2019s hard work being married to a head of government, then you haven\u2019t heard of Joachim Sauer \u2013 which is just the way he likes it. Sure his wife is Angela Merkel, the most powerful woman in the world, so sometimes he has to have dinner with the Obamas, but otherwise \u2026 nothing. No staff. No interviews. No public campaigns. Sauer flies on budget airlines and didn\u2019t even attend his wife\u2019s inauguration in 2005. He likes to be left alone to research quantum chemistry. France: five, eight or none     Julie Gayet likes to keep a low profile. Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPA    Being president of France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has a complicated arrangement with his wives. The current one, Julie Gayet, keeps a low profile and may need few staff if any. His ex, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, however, was a public first lady in the full French style, spending \u20ac396,900 (\u00a3312,516) on a staff of five in 2013, not including security guards. Yet this was cheap compared with former president Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, who spent \u20ac437,376 on her eight staff, plus \u20ac410,000 on her website. India: a dozen (reluctantly) The status of India\u2019s current first lady \u2013 Jashodaben Narendrabhai Modi \u2013 is weird to the point of Kafkaesque. She and Narendra Modi married, by arrangement, when they were teenagers, but he left soon afterwards and they have neither divorced nor lived together since, and scarcely even met. Mrs Modi now lives quietly retired in a small town in Gujarat, but upon Mr Modi\u2019s election as prime minister, she found herself being followed everywhere by about a dozen security staff in an expensive car, while she goes about on foot or by rickshaw. Apparently the guards also demand to be fed, and Mrs Modi has said she is scared of them. They refuse to identify themselves and the police won\u2019t explain why they\u2019ve been assigned. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 May 2016. An earlier version referred to Angela Merkel as head of state, rather than head of government.",
