  "body": "This book is about a normal school boy Ricky Mitre who has an extremely amazing extendable long arm!  Ricky turns himself into a superhero, and saves the world. Only his best friend Simon knows about his amazing arm. Ricky also has a dog called Elliot. The book is written by Bafta-winning children\u2019s TV presenters, Sam and Mark, who are really funny and it definitely shows in their book.  The story follows Ricky who has an evil supply teacher. Ricky has to save the day! The supply teacher has a son who is called Spencer, and Ricky can\u2019t decide whether to be his friend or not. Will Ricky save the day or will the supply teacher beat him?       I enjoyed the book and loved the funny imagery and adventure. It was very fast-paced in some parts. But also made you wonder in other parts. I found nothing in the book I didn\u2019t like.  If I had to describe the book in three words I would say it is funny, exciting and wondrous. The whole book was amazing and you never got bored on any of the pages. From start to finish I never wanted to put the book down. The ideas in the book were so imaginative.  Sam and Mark also made their own titles for some of the TV shows and games that they\u2019ve been in, which is really creative. I would recommend this book to people aged 8+, because it is quite easy to read and understand, but you do occasionally come up against some harder words.
