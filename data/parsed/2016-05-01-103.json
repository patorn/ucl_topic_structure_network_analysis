  "body": "I was chatting with a friend recently \u2013 a\u00a0successful actor who does abortion-rights advocacy on the side \u2013 about a big pro-choice fundraiser she\u2019s currently orchestrating. It was past midnight at her house, but she was still up, still working, clacking away at her laptop, tying up loose ends, pushing ticket sales, gathering auction items \u2013 her \u201cside\u201d project looking suspiciously like a second full-time job. \u201cYou\u2019re a hero,\u201d I said. \u201cNo, I am not,\u201d she snapped, vehement. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to do it. It\u2019s a fucking embarrassment that I have to.\u201d She was right. \u201cOur country is a septic tank,\u201d I\u00a0sighed. \u201cOn fire.\u201d \u201cFull-on fail.\u201d I still think that choosing to take on the exhausting, sisyphean, largely thankless work of abortion advocacy (we are not taught to say \u201cthank you\u201d for abortion; we are taught to never speak of it at all) is heroic. She could choose to leave that work to others, but she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s\u00a0significant. But that reaction \u2013 somebody\u2019s got to do it, so I\u00a0do \u2013 triggered a familiar weariness in me. We shouldn\u2019t have to spend our spare time working,\u00a0pro bono, to remove stigma from a\u00a0procedure so common that a full third of the women you know have had one; or to raise money to help impoverished pregnant people travel hundreds of miles, to other states, to exercise a legal right; or to convince a supposedly free and enlightened nation, in 2016, that people with uteruses are autonomous human beings deserving of basic medical care. Each of these things should be a given, and we\u2019ve been having this conversation since before my grandmother was born, so why are we still talking about it now? When will the \u201cdebate\u201d end so that women can finally be fully invested in their work and passions and lives? It was when I sat down to write about Donald Trump\u2019s statement \u2013 he said: \u201cFrankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I\u00a0don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5% of the vote. The\u00a0only thing she\u2019s got going is the women\u2019s card\u201d \u2013 that I realised: it\u2019s the same\u00a0thing. How many times do feminists have to deconstruct and debunk the notion of the \u201cwoman card\u201d? How many rounds are we going to go this time? How many thinkpieces do we need before society accepts that sexism is real and we can move on to the far more important work of repairing the damage it has caused? The next time some rightwing dillweed drops a turd like \u201cwoman card\u201d, will anyone remember that women have already done this labour? Or will we just have to do it all over again? What a tremendous, tedious, pointless drain on our time and energy. Imagine what we could accomplish if we were just allowed to do our jobs. I hate this election. Everything about it makes me miserable. Donald Trump. Donald Trump\u2019s fans. Twitter. Abortion. Xenophobia. That thing on Ted Cruz\u2019s lip. The opinions in Ted Cruz\u2019s brain. Walls. Refugees. Four hundred and ninety-seven thousand debates. My Bernie friends yelling at my Hillary friends. My Hillary friends\u00a0yelling at my Bernie friends. Straight white men insisting that identity politics have no value. The random dude who yelled at me for tweeting that I liked that little bird that landed on Bernie Sanders\u2019s podium, because he thought it sounded like I\u00a0liked the bird better than Bernie, and none shall besmirch the honour of the Bern on Trevor\u2019s watch. (\u201cI get it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a vagina.\u201d) But maybe what I hate the most about this election is thinking about all the goddamn writing\u00a0I\u2019m going to have to do for the next four (or, potentially, eight) years if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency. Misogynist rhetoric is going\u00a0to\u00a0reach levels of frenzy heretofore unknown to science, and with misogynist rhetoric comes feminist outcry, and with feminist outcry comes dopey faux-confusion: \u201cI don\u2019t get why this is sexist. Explain it to me. Debate with me. Help me. Convince me.\u201d There is no sense of memory, of the fact that all of this has been explained many, many times before. Because why would they want to remember? The incessant demand that women \u201cdebate\u201d and defend our own humanity is a deliberate diversion meant to hobble our power \u2013 part of the mechanism of\u00a0sexism itself. Do you know what I care about? Young-adult fantasy novels, detective shows and writing comedy with my husband. Do you know what I\u00a0spend my time writing about? Abortion, online harassment and rape, over and over, around and around. Not that I\u2019m not passionate about those issues \u2013 I am, deeply \u2013 but my passion is born of necessity. I would love to not have to\u00a0care. \u201cHopefully, we won\u2019t have to do many more of these,\u201d my friend said of her fundraiser, \u201cbut you should come next year!\u201d Hopefully, some day, abortion will be affordable and accessible everywhere, and we can go back to whatever we were doing before we were forced to fight for our lives. Hopefully, we won\u2019t have say this all over again. But we know we will.",
