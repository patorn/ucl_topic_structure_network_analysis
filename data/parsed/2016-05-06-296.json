But sadly for many of the rock greats it has become almost a cliche that successful musicians and groups are more valued in the grave than in life. Few people understand that better than Jeffrey Jampol, an LA-based specialist whose JAM Inc manages the rock estates of Otis Redding, Kurt Cobain, the Doors, Rick James, Ramones and Muddy Waters among others, as well as advising the co-executors of Michael Jackson\u2019s estate. With the roll call of potential names Jampol could add to his stable increasing as the grim reaper goes about his harvest in rock\u2019nroll hall of fame, Jampol says the heirs to these estates face two key challenges: how to prevent the kind of legal chaos that has paralysed many legends\u2019 fortunes, like the mess that took over James Brown\u2019s estate following his death in 2006, and how to protect and manage that legacy once freed of warring heirs and factions.  Jampol, who at one time helped manage New Order in the US, has become the go-to guy for this type of management. Getting it right can generate a fortune. Michael Jackson\u2019s estate is far wealthier now by virtue of the fact that the singer is not around to spend the proceeds or put a wrench in management\u2019s plans. The King of Pop has earned more than $1bn before taxes since his death, according to Forbes, enough to pay off his personal debts and then some. The same is true of the Ramones. The band\u2019s fortunes suffered from a long war of attrition between Joey, the singer, and Johnny, the guitarist, that was carried on by their heirs long after their deaths. Jampol helped to settle grievances so that the current Ramones show at the Queens Museum in New York could take place.    Related: 'They wanted to be as big as the Beatles': revisiting the Ramones' legacy    \u201cThis is not the music business. This is the pop culture legacy business. I tell clients, if you think it\u2019s about the music, you\u2019ve already failed,\u201d Jampol told the Guardian. \u201cBy that logic, you\u2019d think the magic of James Dean was his acting. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d Merely re-issuing an artist\u2019s work is not enough. Even in the case of Prince, who died intestate (without a will), the mysterious vault said to contain hundreds of unreleased tracks might be no more than a curiosity to collectors that does little to connect Prince to a new generation of fans \u2013 the lifeblood of any legacy act as established fans are lost to natural attrition.      Prince: died intestate with no clear plans for the future of his legacy and $300m fortune Photograph: REX/Shutterstock    It\u2019s not enough, to quote The Smiths\u2019 Paint a Vulgar Picture, to: \u201cRe-issue, re-package, re-package/ Re-evaluate the songs/ Double-pack with a photograph/ Extra track and a tacky badge.\u201d Families often push for this short-term tactic but it can quickly drain a legacy, leaving little behind, said Jampol. Simply putting out best of compilations can end up diminishing an estate\u2019s value. \u201cYou can go into the vault and make a bunch of albums but then it\u2019s done,\u201d he said. Listed foremost on Jam Inc\u2019s Hippocratic Oath of Rock: Do no harm. Too often, the stewards of great legacy artists, in music and other artistic media, chase perceived opportunities without considering their impact upon the legacy they\u2019re supposed to be looking after. Great performers\u2019 works and images are priceless in the eyes of their fans, and every care must be taken to keep that connection intact. What is needed, says Jampol, in a not uncommon moment of management-marketing speak, is to locate the \u201cartist\u2019s essence\u201d. \u201cFigure out what the magic is. There\u2019s something that connects James Dean or Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain or the Ramones to a 12-year-old whether that\u2019s in 1957 or 2017. It could be a group of facets and then you have to find a way to be put that back into the pop culture in a way that\u2019s credible to a teenager,\u201d he said. It may sound like gauzy marketing speak \u2013 Jampol also lectures as an adjunct professor in music business at UCLA \u2013 still, he has a point. Punk is 40 years old, but \u201cquestioning authority, being an outsider, not caring about the social order are absolutely not dead\u201d.     The Sex Pistols: Punk may be 40 but questioning authority never gets old Photograph: Jorgen Angel/Redferns via    Janis Joplin is a case in point. Jampol says he went to the family ahead of the documentary Little Girl Blue and the successful touring musical Janis and told them he wanted to position her as an icon of hope. But the story he wanted to tell, of being a bi-sexual heroin user might run counter to how they want her story narrated. \u201cJanis wore her heart on her sleeve. She made no bones about wanting to be loved. She wasn\u2019t beautiful. She didn\u2019t come from privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never compromised her vision to succeed. Yet she shattered the glass ceiling without ever compromising her values.\u201d The same was true of Jim Morrison. \u201cI have a simple job \u2013 to talk about everything. Janis\u2019s lovers. Jim Morrison\u2019s alcoholism. I don\u2019t have to manipulate the truth, I just have to reveal it. But you have to understand the context.\u201d Jampol learnt from Danny Sugerman (The Doors\u2019 one time manager) how to negotiate the complex interpersonal relationships of a band. That begs the question, why does the rock and roll dream often end so acrimoniously?  \u201cArtists are very passionate about what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut neither bands nor musicians have a great way to process issues, and issues come up over 20 or 30 years. If you don\u2019t have a way to process that, and you add in a few zeros of wealth and a dusting of celebrity that everybody wants\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a prescription for chaos and management headaches long into the future. At the same time new sources of cash are reinvigorating dead artists\u2019 fortunes. Revenue streams now include musicals, museum shows and documentaries. The Jackson documentary This Is It took $261m at the US box office and as much as $400m worldwide. Soon, we could see legacy acts appearing as holograms; the Beatles\u2019 Vegas show brought in millions; Bob Marley\u2019s highly-dysfunctional family puts his name to dozens of products including boomboxes. Like Willie Nelson, the Marley clan has added marijuana to its range of products. It seems the rock legacy business is only getting larger. This week, the California promoter Goldenvoice announced a massive, pre-mortality rock\u2019n\u2019roll mega concert in October featuring Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Neil Young, The Who, Paul McCartney and Roger Waters. With tickets for the three-day festival pegged at a basic $1,599, the acts are expected to take home around $7m a piece.

In September, there will be \u201can evening of respect\u201d at the Big O ranch outside Memphis where Redding\u2019s widow and sons still live.  But clearly, there are still big jobs to be done. James Brown\u2019s estate remains tied up in litigation; Jimi Hendrix\u2019s estate is notorious for saying no to every request. Jampol says the one thing you cannot do, is try to imagine what the artists would have thought. It\u2019s not the issue and it\u2019s an impossible question to answer.  Estates are not run for artist, or to imagine their wants, but to protect and advance their legacy, Jampol believes. But getting to that stage is seldom easy. With claims from alleged illegitimate children already surfacing, Prince estate could turn into a quagmire of litigation. Prince\u2019s only full sibling, Tyka Nelson, has requested management of his affairs be placed with a special administrator, Bremer Trust, until a representative is appointed - or a will is located. That could still happen. Six days after Michael Jackson died in 2009, his longtime lawyer John Branca filed a will, ending efforts by Jackson\u2019s mother to become his estate\u2019s executor.  When a star dies, those left behind often think first of the cash they are losing. They need to think more about posterity, said Jampol. \u201cCan we make any money is the last question you want to ask. I like to animate and lift up the body. Once the artist is back in the cultural conversation, the revenue follows.\u201d",
