  "body": "With their addictive cocktail of glamorous parties, shameless infidelity and boardroom backstabbings, TV shows about the super-rich have rarely seemed grounded in reality. But recent programmes like The Night Manager and Billions are thought to offer a truer reflection of the uber-wealthy, with plots drawn from real-life corruption.  Billions, which follows hedge fund manager Bobby \u201cAxe\u201d Axelrod, has been described as \u201cthe rare show that understands the rich\u201d. Showrunners Brian Koppelman and David Levien say they have received emails from famous billionaires praising the series, which focuses on the battle between Axelrod (Damian Lewis) and US attorney general Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti), who is convinced Axe is doing illegal insider trading.  \u201cWe were taken out to dinner and people would say: \u2018Let me tell you more over this $2,000 bottle of wine,\u2019\u201d says Levien. \u201cThen, after a couple of glasses, they\u2019d say: \u2018You\u2019ve really nailed the way it is.\u2019\u201d   Levien says their research found this degree of wealth to be almost throwaway and casual, so they eschewed the glitz of 80s shows such as Dallas and Dynasty. \u201cThese guys were so far beyond wealthy that they don\u2019t have to obey the standard codes,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to impress anyone.\u201d  We have assembled a panel of experts with firsthand insights into the lives of the global super-rich \u2013 from advisers to billionaires to a former crew member on a superyacht \u2013 to assess which shows are bang on the money.

Photograph: Jeff Neumann/Showtime    The ruthless but charming Axe won praise for his Metallica fanboy status and dressed-down style. \u201cMost super-rich people are quite relaxed,\u201d says Emma Spence, who has worked on board superyachts and for a yacht broker. \u201cIt\u2019s accurate to show him signing contracts in a hoodie and jeans or a T-shirt. He\u2019s got a Rolex that\u2019s probably worth $50,000, but unless you know those signifiers you can\u2019t tell he\u2019s wealthy. It\u2019s spot on. Most of the super-rich I have dealt with wear Hawaiian shirts and cargo pants. You\u2019re at the top of your game: you don\u2019t need to display your wealth because your reputation precedes you.\u201d Spence, who is now completing a PhD on superyachts, also praised the programme for striking the balance between Axe\u2019s alpha-male antics at work and his philanthropy (he put the kids of colleagues who died in the terrorist attacks on the twin towers through college). \u201cI like the way Axe is guarded about the 9/11 college fund,\u201d says Spence, who has observed up close the private lives of super-rich families. \u201cThat seems pretty accurate.\u201d Spence was less convinced by Axelrod\u2019s personal chef cooking dinner for the family every night. \u201cObviously people do live like that,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t what I would have expected on an ordinary evening \u2013 even if they do lead a busy lifestyle.\u201d Gossip Girl     Rich kids \u2026 Blake Lively and Leighton Meester as Serena and Blair in Gossip Girl. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock    The cult teen show followed privileged high-school students in Manhattan\u2019s Upper East side, centred around \u201cit girl\u201d Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively), who hides a scandalous past, and her on/off best friend Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester).  Tutors figure heavily in the show\u2019s early episodes, with students and their parents prepared to offer anything for good grades. Mark Maclaine, tutor to the children of Hollywood stars, royalty and world leaders, says this happens frequently in the real world. \u201cI was offered a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as a signing-on gift,\u201d he says. \u201cI turned it down. Another family offered to pay off my mortgage. It\u2019s not unusual for a tutor to get a Rolex when they finish work with a family. One woman was offered a \u00a35,000 clothing allowance to update her wardrobe because she was staying with the family for six months and they wanted to make sure she was really sharp.\u201d Gossip Girl is also characterised by largely absent parents and children who are old before their time. Maclaine says he has seen many kids being brought up by their nannies, estranged from their families. \u201cThere are definitely cases where I\u2019ve been asked to behave as a replacement parent. One kid hadn\u2019t seen his mum for several days, because the staff put dinner on for him and his brothers and sisters at a different time to their parents.\u201d The Night Manager     The inner circle \u2026 Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston), Corcoran (Tom Hollander) and Roper (Hugh Laurie) in The Night Manager. Photograph: BBC/The Ink Factory/Des Willie    In the BBC thriller, Tom Hiddleston plays soldier-turned-hotel-worker-turned-spy Jonathan Pine, who worms his way into the inner circle of sociopathic arms dealer and billionaire Richard Roper. Over the course of the series, Pine displaces Roper\u2019s suavely menacing right-hand man Major Lance \u201cCorky\u201d Corcoran, becoming chief executive of one of Roper\u2019s shell companies. Corky\u2019s role is similar to the chief executives of family offices \u2013 private firms that manage the affairs of the very wealthiest families (worth at least $250m). Keith Johnston, CEO of the Family Office Council, which represents 100 single-family offices with total assets of $100bn, says The Night Manager\u2019s portrayal of staff\u2019s dependence on the head of the family, known in the trade as the \u201cprincipal\u201d, is absolutely accurate. He says: \u201cCorcoran is suddenly exiled without explanation when Roper loses faith in him. The family office is like running a mini-court, where access to the principal is all-important. Staff have to be careful not to overstep the professional line. This can be particularly tricky if you are entertained by your principal; there is the temptation to let your hair down. Corcoran drinks too much and acts in an informal way that would be beyond a typical professional relationship. His drinking and easy way leads to a faux pas, which Pine takes advantage of.\u201d But is it realistic that Roper lets Pine into his confidence without much fuss? Mark Somers, founder of executive recruitment firm Somers Partnership, says it is not unheard of for super-wealthy families to fail to carry out background checks if they deem an applicant trustworthy. He says: \u201cThe hazard for the family office is that it\u2019s unregulated. The number of well-poisoners is enormously high: unsuitable people might want to emulate their client\u2019s glamorous lifestyles. It tends to attract Walter Mitty types.\u201d Empire     The Lyon pride in Empire. Photograph: James Dimmock/FOX    Described by its creator Lee Daniels as a \u201cblack Dynasty\u201d, Empire charts the feuds of the Lyon family, sparked when record company mogul Lucious (Terrence Howard) announces he will name one of his three sons as his successor. Meanwhile, their mother and Lucious\u2019s ex-wife Cookie is released from prison after 17 years and demands her share of the business, started with the drug money she was jailed for earning. When he refuses, it starts an all-out war for control of the company. Sara Vestin Rahmani, founder of Bespoke Bureau, a high-end recruitment agency, calls Cookie \u201ca great example of the independent 21st-century self-made woman\u201d. But Dr Luna Glucksberg, of Goldsmiths University, says Cookie\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit is at odds with her research into gender roles among the super-rich. \u201cThe ultra-high-net-worth women I\u2019ve interviewed didn\u2019t build the businesses,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not their money: they marry into it, they inherit it.\u201d Cookie\u2019s feisty fearlessness did remind her of one interviewee, though \u2013 a very senior career woman who defied conservative conventions. \u201cShe wore no makeup, she had grey hair but she was very powerful. She didn\u2019t play the dolly-bird game.\u201d  Jonathan Lidster, who advises rich families on inheritance issues, says that without preparation, family dynamics can \u201cblow up in your face\u201d just as they do in Empire. \u201cThe eldest son, Andre, is entrepreneurial and a natural leader,\u201d says Lidster. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t want to do it as his father did, which results in a massive dispute.\u201d At first, Lucious favours his youngest son, rising bad-boy rapper Hakeem, rejecting his middle son, musical genius Jamal, because he is gay.  Lidster says sexual orientation can be an issue when it comes to succession planning, though the problem tends to arise more among the non-western super-rich. He points to the case of Hong Kong property magnate Cecil Chao, who offered HK$1billion (\u00a380m) to any eligible bachelor who could convince his lesbian daughter Gigi to get married. This was despite the fact that she was already married to her long-term partner. Johnston also contrasts Empire\u2019s black cast with the almost exclusively white depictions of wealth in most TV shows. \u201cAbout two thirds of the super-rich we see are non-dom, and although that includes white Europeans and Americans, a large number are non-white,\u201d he says. \u201cTV is not good at representing the ethnic diversity of ultra-high-net-worth individuals.\u201d",
