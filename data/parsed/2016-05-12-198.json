  "body": "When you\u2019re a kid, no one tells you how tough being an adult is going to be. There\u2019s the endless (failed) attempts to budget, successfully organise nights out, wash clothes, cook, sustain/ find relationships, pay bills \u2013 and all this must be done while trying not to get fired.  Chaz Hutton, a London-based designer and illustrator, has captured the struggles of adulthood on his Instagram feed, with hilarious results.        He\u2019s not the only person to do this. Illustrator Samantha Jayne creates witty words and drawings to explore the transition from youth to adulthood, focusing on the so-called \u201cquarter-life crisis\u201d and the complexities of growing up in modern times.       We thought we\u2019d get readers of all ages to sketch out what it\u2019s like to be a fully-fleged adult. Is it as you imagined? What\u2019s the worst part of it all? Share your pictures with us below, and explain your depictions. The best ones will appear in an article we\u2019ll publish online.",
