Don\u2019t sit at home moping about what could have been when you could be at a gig or a sports event that you\u2019ll be able to talk about for the rest of your life! Martin Werner convincingly brings this proposition to life with energy and humour.Agency: Goodby Silverstein & Partners (San Francisco) Director: Martin Werner  Royal Danish Theatre: \u2018Creation\u2019 (starts at 01:08) - Denmark Handel\u2019s Sarabande forms the backbone of this intriguing advert for the Royal Danish Theatre. The music incorporates sounds originating from a vast array of theatre-related activities: vocal exercises, costume-making and dance practice all contribute their unique aural texture to remind us that a performance is about far more than the actors on stage.Agency: Wichmann/Schmidt Director: Casper Balslev  League Against Cruel Sports: \u2018Silent Enemy\u2019 (starts at 02:47) - UK Graphic depictions of animal cruelty and neglect tend to make us avert our eyes rather than face the unpalatable truths they convey. So it\u2019s no easy feat to successfully serve up such messages in ways we can swallow \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly what this spot for the League Against Cruel Sports manages. Swapping a wild animal for a human animal, it demonstrates how snaring kills... and leaves us in no doubt we should back the campaign calling for snares to be made illegal.Director: Paul Murphy Bepanthen: \u201810th Month\u2019 (starts at 04:38) - UK This extremely moving film for Bepanthen takes a look at the first month of motherhood and provides some pretty startling insights which are cleverly underlined by the way it\u2019s presented. The first half is as baby-centric as these mothers have come to expect. Close-up photography disembodies the voices of mothers speaking different languages and they are effectively \u2013 if affectionately \u2013 reduced to the nurturing machines their babies require. But they are stopped short when asked how they are doing.Agency: JWT London Director: Elizabeth Stopford  Jason Stone is the editor of David Reviews",
