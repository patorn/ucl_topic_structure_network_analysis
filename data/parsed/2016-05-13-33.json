  "body": "\u2022 An extract from Grit, a book by the psychologist Angela Duckworth, in last Saturday\u2019s Family section included a table under the heading \u201cHow gritty are you?\u201d We should have said that the copyright for the Grit scale, which Duckworth devised and used in her studies, belongs to her and that it cannot be reproduced without permission (Is grit the true secret of success?, page 5). \u2022 Images accompanying a feature on the artist and activist David Wojnarowicz in this Saturday\u2019s Review section should have been credited to the estate of David Wojnarowicz and PPOW Gallery, New York (\u2018Smell the flowers while you can\u2019, 14 May, page 20). \u2022 A report (US falling short on corruption fight, PM suggests, 13 May, page 15) misspelled Alden McLaughlin\u2019s surname as McClaughlin, and misdescribed him as president of the Cayman Islands. He\u00a0is the premier of the British Overseas Territory; it does not have a president.",
