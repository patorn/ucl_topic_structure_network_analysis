One parent was heartily applauded at a recent campaign meeting after claiming that her daughter\u2019s school had been turned into a \u201cbrutal exam factory like a workhouse\u201d without families getting any say. She has now named the school. Fiona Forrest, a member of the group Rescue Our Schools \u2013 set up to fight for greater community involvement in education \u2013 says that the character of her daughter\u2019s school, St Matthew academy in Blackheath, south London, has altered dramatically after changes made following a poor set of GCSE results last year. The school, rated by Ofsted as \u201cgood\u201d, is sponsored by the Catholic Diocese of Southwark. It takes pupils aged three to 16. Forrest says: \u201cIt used to be a caring, inclusive school.\u201d Since a new executive headteacher and governing board arrived, though, things have changed, she feels, with the school no longer displaying the Christian ethos that attracted her to it. \u201cNow it\u2019s lots of rules and lots of shouting and lots of detentions.\u201d Detentions even take place on Saturdays, she says. \u201cLast term they closed our school library to use as a detention centre.\u201d Some pupils are expected to line up in silence before school, she says, and there is no morning break. \u201cAre there no rules against that, like in the workplace?\u201d Forrest is also unhappy that the school compares pupils academically, with rankings displayed on the wall. \u201cOur wonderful [former] head of primary and her deputy have gone and it\u2019s all about Sats [in primary].\u201d Forrest says she has nothing against academies \u2013 St Matthew has been an academy since 2007 \u2013 so long as the schools are working well. But it is very difficult for parents to have their voices heard when they have concerns. \u201cThese changes have been dictated with no consultation,\u201d she says. In response to Forrest\u2019s concerns about the change in atmosphere at the school, the Catholic Diocese of Southwark says: \u201cSt Matthew is a popular school [and] offers a broad and rich curriculum,\u201d but it points out that the school\u2019s GCSE results had been falling for three years. As a result, the diocese and the government\u2019s regional schools commissioner had \u201cbrought in support from local outstanding schools\u201d, which had resulted in \u201ca number of changes to the learning and teaching environment\u201d. It\u00a0says the changes have been well received by pupils, staff, parents and the\u00a0local authority. Morgan: muddled, or\u00a0misleading?  Did the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, mislead the Commons education select committee during a recent meeting at which she was pressed on the government\u2019s plan to turn all schools into academies? Morgan told the committee non\u2011academy schools \u201chave only had one school improvement service that they have been able to purchase\u201d. This implied that they had to stick with whatever support their local authority could provide, regardless of its quality, and that becoming an academy would provide greater flexibility. But when your correspondent asked on twitter if this was really the case, headteachers were quick to point out that it was not: schools of all types have been free to choose which services to use for years. Indeed guidance [pdf] to local authority schools on securing value for money, from Morgan\u2019s own department, seems to underline the point. It says schools should \u201cshop around \u2013 use competition to encourage established suppliers to offer better value deals\u201d. So would the Department for Education concede that Morgan\u2019s statement was misleading or, perhaps as bad, just mistaken? It had not replied by the time Education Guardian went to press. Sad tale of school that did not improve  Sometimes it seems that \u201cintervening\u201d in a school by changing its management and governors can go badly wrong. The current leadership of Sedgehill school, one of the largest comprehensives in Lewisham, south London, would fiercely contest that view. But a new Ofsted verdict has placed the school in special measures after a tumultuous time for this local authority secondary. In 2013, Sedgehill received a \u201crequires improvement\u201d judgment from inspectors, though its leadership, governance and pupil behaviour were rated good. Lewisham council was not happy with its performance, though, sacking governors in 2014 and trying to force the school into a partnership with Bethnal Green academy. Bethnal Green withdrew from the deal following a petition with 1,800 signatures opposing the plan and in support of the then-head, Ken Mackenzie. Then Mackenzie resigned after Lewisham sought to push ahead with management change anyway, installing a new chief executive, Julia Scannell, above him. The new Ofsted report, released on\u00a029\u00a0April, found the school \u201cinadequate\u201d, including for leadership and management and behaviour. Fewer than half of staff completing Ofsted\u2019s questionnaire felt it was well led and managed, the inspectorate reported. Scannell and Andrew Milliken, Sedgehill\u2019s \u201chead of school\u201d, sent a letter [pdf] to parents saying that a \u201cvery lengthy\u201d complaint had been made to Ofsted about its \u201cunfair and deeply unjust\u201d verdict. Ofsted had fixated on specific details about the school\u2019s data and then extrapolated negative findings, said the letter, adding that the current leadership team had discovered a \u00a31m debt after taking over. What a sad story this seems. Procedures reviewed after racist language  Finally, our story last week about the academies chief who used the N-word in a meeting and then laughed about it was followed up in the local press. But has any action beyond a telling off been taken in relation to Philip Cantwell, director of education at Creative Education Trust, which has 13 schools? Cantwell admitted using the phrase \u201cnigger in the woodpile\u201d during a meeting at Weavers academy, Northamptonshire, last June, after a whistleblower complained. To judge from CET\u2019s website, the trust has seen no need to publish a statement or apology there, despite Cantwell\u2019s position in leading young people and school staff. Cantwell has said he deeply regrets his use of language. The trust said last week that he had been reprimanded and that it was committed to promoting a culture of tolerance and respect, and that it was reviewing its procedures. When we hear news of that review, we will let you know.",
