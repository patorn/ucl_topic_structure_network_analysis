Down the hallway is the office of Michael Weinstein, the forthright head of the billion-dollar not-for-profit organization who is the first to volunteer that he is regarded as a \u201ccondom Nazi\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big whoop about condoms?\u201d he said, sitting amid the expansive, 21st-floor views of Los Angeles and photographs showing him with notables such as Whoopi Goldberg and Alicia Keys. \u201cI just don\u2019t get why it\u2019s such a sacrifice.\u201d His nonchalance is not shared by everyone. Weinstein is behind a ballot that Californians will vote on in November, asking whether actors in porn films should be required to wear condoms. The industry is unimpressed. \u201cI think the guy is just a Jesus freak,\u201d said Larry Flynt, head of the Hustler empire. When it was pointed out to him that Weinstein was Jewish, he replied: \u201cMaybe he\u2019s a Jew for Jesus.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s motivations are by no means ecclesiastical. A towering figure among HIV/Aids activists, his organization funds hundreds of clinics in dozens of countries. It operates a thrift store chain called Out of the Closet and has round-the-year ads running on 21 Los Angeles billboards encouraging sexual health and STD checkups. A current one, parroting the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, reads: \u201cFeel the Burn?\u201d    When I hear people saying that we\u2019re litigious, my thinking is like, aren\u2019t we supposed to be?  Michael Weinstein     He is nevertheless vilified in certain quarters. \u201cSomehow people are OK in their minds dichotomizing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe services we provide and all the things we do are great, but I\u2019m a demon.\u201d In his politicking, Weinstein is known for a hard-nosed approach, which he defines as \u201cholding people morally responsible\u201d or \u201capplying political pressure in places where they\u2019re vulnerable\u201d. He doesn\u2019t believe advocacy should be limited to rallies. \u201cWhen I hear people saying that we\u2019re litigious, my thinking is like, aren\u2019t we supposed to be?\u201d Of late, the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) has sued Los Angeles County, the city of Los Angeles and the drug manufacturer Gilead.  And it has a yen for puckish marketing. In ads from 2015, Tinder and Grindr users were depicted as courting chlamydia and gonorrhea. Especially disputatious is Weinstein\u2019s position on the daily pill known as Prep, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, which has been hailed as a breakthrough in HIV prevention. The Centers for Disease Control recommends its use in conjunction with condoms, noting that it reduces the risk of infections by more than 90%.

Photograph: Don Bartletti/LA Times via Getty Images     Weinstein labeled it a \u201cparty drug\u201d, contending that people have been shown to miss doses and that its usage could erode \u201ccondom culture\u201d. Critics counter that people don\u2019t use condoms all the time, either. On policy issues, AHF \u201cis the Tea Party of the HIV movement,\u201d said James Loduca, senior vice-president at the San Francisco Aids Foundation. \u201cI don\u2019t see him as a demon. I see him as a savior,\u201d said Cynthia Davis, the chair of AHF\u2019s board of directors. \u201cI\u2019ve seen first-hand how we, under his leadership and guidance, have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\u201d Weinstein, 63, lives in the Hollywood Hills area, with palm-fringed views of the city and, in the far distance, his office building. Sober in appearance, he is married to his partner of 18 years, with whom he owns a nail salon. \u201cI think we\u2019re a monument in compatibility,\u201d he said. \u201cI call him Dr Fun.\u201d A Sanders supporter, Weinstein has long leaned hard to the left. As a young man, he was drawn to anti-war and civil rights movements, and was a leader of the Lavender and Red Union, a group founded around 1974 that operated on the premise that \u201cgay liberation is impossible without socialist revolution\u201d. It was during the Aids epidemic that Weinstein came to prominence. In 1986, a fringe political figure named Lyndon LaRouche spearheaded a campaign that could have led, according to its detractors, to the quarantine of Aids patients in California.  Weinstein joined the fray and shifted the effort against it toward \u201cvolunteer, grassroots efforts focused on LaRouche, on what a crazy he was\u201d,\u201d recalled Torie Osborn, a longtime LGBT activist. A poster for a torchlight march proclaimed: \u201cStop Aids concentration camps.\u201d. The measure was defeated soundly.

Every two weeks there was a ceremony where balloons were released for those who had passed away. Weinstein estimates that 4,000 people died in his hospices. \u201cMichael was the visionary,\u201d said Phill Wilson, the president of the Black Aids Institute, whose partner co-founded the hospice with Weinstein and died of the disease soon after. Weinstein \u201cwas the person who came up with the idea. He was the person who believed and convinced us to believe\u201d. Weinstein himself started using condoms regularly around 1984. \u201cI think I would be positive today if I wasn\u2019t strict about that\u201d he said. The role of condoms in porn became a concern of his in 2004, after several performers tested HIV-positive. California officials say that condoms already are required under regulations aimed at protecting workers from bloodborne pathogens. The porn industry is trying to change that, arguing that the rules are outdated. Weinstein\u2019s new measure has sharper teeth, because it could allow any California resident to sue producers, distributors and talent agents. He says his goals are to stamp out STDs among performers and for porn to set a good example for viewers.

The Free Speech Coalition operates out of a nondescript, three-person office, in a building with a Szechuan restaurant and an optometrist. In one room a placard reads: \u201cPerformers have choices. It\u2019s their body, not Weinstein\u2019s.\u201d Actors say their livelihoods are in danger, while millions in tax revenues could be lost if the condom measure passes and companies go elsewhere. \u201cI make most of my income just at my house with my partner,\u201d said Ella Nova, an elfin performer with a love of Harry Potter. She praised the industry\u2019s own voluntary testing system. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to me, these people who do this thing that I love so much. Why would I ever jeopardize their health?\u201d \u201cThe adult industry is not the sex education class of the United States,\u201d Eric Paul Leue, a well-built German activist with a flaxen beard who was was crowned Mr. LA Leather 2014, said on a phone call. Using the director of the blockbuster movie Independence Day as an example, he added: \u201cRoland Emmerich didn\u2019t try to teach us how to defend ourselves against aliens.\u201d Surprisingly, perhaps, the proposal also has been panned by groups such as Aids Project Los Angeles, which says that while it supports safer sex, the measure will push the industry underground, or to places with fewer safeguards. Hustler already films out of state, in Mexico or Nevada, according to Flynt. Viewers, he thinks, are turned off by the sight of condoms. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the psychological barrier is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like jerking off with gloves on, do you know what I mean?\u201d Weinstein is optimistic about the measure\u2019s prospects. In the meantime, some who have watched his ascent, such as Wilson of the Black Aids Institute, say they wonder what drives him. Perhaps, Wilson ventured, he is catalyzed by the specter of \u201cthe kind of sexual revolution that happened in the 70s, that some argue was the precursor to how AIDS spread the way it spread among gay men.\u201d Is Weinstein afraid this era might return? \u201cAll of us want to have sex with abandon. That\u2019s part of the glory of sex, but there are consequences,\u201d Weinstein said. He worries people are suffering from \u201cAids amnesia\u201d and have not learned the lessons of the epidemic. \u201cSometimes people refer to me, and people like me, as dinosaurs from the 80s. And you know, I can plead guilty to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a perspective that was shaped by living through the absolute worst.\u201d",
