Unless you\u2019re an interpreter for the UN \u2013 which has more than 10,000 troops in the north \u2013 or work in the security industry, job prospects look bleak. In a country where young job seekers aged from 15 to 39 make up about 80% of all unemployed people, one school seems to be bucking the trend. Perhaps surprisingly, it teaches art, theatre, dance and music.  \u201cAround 60% of our students get jobs when they graduate,\u201d says Abdoulaye Konat\u00e9, the director and founder of the renowned Balla Fass\u00e9k\u00e9 Kouyat\u00e9 Conservatory, known as Camm or the Conservatoire.  Konat\u00e9 is one of Mali\u2019s most famous contemporary artists. He uses traditional materials and techniques in his textile-based work, which has been featured in exhibitions in London\u2019s Hayward Gallery, Washington\u2019s Smithsonian National Museum of African Art and the Pompidou Centre in Paris.

They arrive neatly folded, like quilts, and are spread out on the floor.  The first shows the outline of a man holding his detached cranium, which is overrunning with blood. The work is called Immigration and the message is clear: when native talent leaves countries, it has devastating consequences. Migration has always been a part of life in Mali but it has achieved a new level of international visibility now, according to Isaie Dougnon, an assistant professor at the University of Bamako who specialises in migration. \u201cIt\u2019s hit the news as Europe has put up legal and physical barriers,\u201d he says, noting that young people were also leaving for central Africa, including Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. Konat\u00e9 founded Camm in 2004. At first a personal project, it is now funded by the government, through the ministry of culture. For Konat\u00e9 binding people to their homeland is part of its mission. He was among 70 African artists featured in Simon Njami\u2019s 2005 Africa Remix show in London. He\u2019s showing work at the Eva International, Ireland\u2019s biennial of contemporary art, and has a retrospective at the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Denmark this year. Konat\u00e9 explains that there are three strands to the school\u2019s curriculum.  The first is academic: students learn the basic principles of art, such as proportion, anatomy, technique and the canon. The second strand aims to instil a profound knowledge of \u2013 and pride in \u2013 the Malian heritage.  \u201cIt is important that they understand the techniques and concepts behind their own culture,\u201d Konat\u00e9 says. To emphasise this, he has insisted that teachers of traditional techniques be paid the same as those with official qualifications.

Ti\u00e9coura N\u2019Daou, a former student and visual artist from Mopti in central Mali, now teaches at the Conservatoire. He was recently featured in a contemporary art festival in S\u00e3o Paulo, VideoBrasil, and is even more upbeat than Konat\u00e9 about the percentage of students who get jobs in Mali after studying at the Conservatoire. \u201cMore than 70% find work in media agencies, teaching, freelance projects \u2013 or they start up their own projects,\u201d he says. This is important economically. Migrants within Mali send back money to their families, and this improves living conditions throughout the country, according to Abdoullah Coulibaly, founder and chairman of the annual Bamako Forum \u2013 referred to by some as the Davos of Africa.  He says that retaining these people in Mali helps \u201cto secure a dynamic workforce\u201d and support development more generally. An international outlook is important to Konat\u00e9, who invites teachers from France, Guinea, Niger and Ivory Coast to the school under an exchange programme known as the Voie Sacr\u00e9e, or sacred path.  There are about three students to every teacher and 20 of the college\u2019s 80 teachers are from other countries. The 260 students must take a tough entrance exam, and come from all over Mali and the rest of Africa.  Konat\u00e9 feels that this diversity allows students to experience different artistic techniques and current trends, and to question preconceptions.  \u201cPerhaps at the end, the student will find his artistic personality,\u201d he says.

We\u2019re not here to form artists, because that is difficult to do, but if they want to become artists, we\u2019ve given them the tools to do so.\u201d There is more at stake than jobs. As Mali recalibrates after the civil war, art and culture are key weapons in the battle for peace, reconciliation and economic sustainability. The Conservatoire\u2019s concert hall hosted the opening night of the Festival Acoustik de Bamako, the first international music festival to take place in Bamako since 2012. It was organised by the Grammy award-winning kora player Toumani Diabat\u00e9, who has taught at the school. In the courtyard, students performed traditional dances from the Mand\u00e9, Dogon, S\u00e9gou and Djenn\u00e9 regions. N\u2019Daou says this unity is important.  \u201cThe Conservatoire plays an important role. The students have worked on songs and art that talk of peace and reconciliation. One of their songs, which encourages Malians to come together, has been played on national television.\u201d Konat\u00e9, who retired in December but is staying on temporarily until a replacement is found, also believes that the school, as well as training students in skills that will allow them to live and work in Mali, can help repair the societal fractures caused by recent conflicts.  \u201cSolutions will not be found in occupying territories or arms sales or terrorism. People have to listen to each other, they have to discuss, and each side has to yield a little so that people can live in peace together.\u201d",
