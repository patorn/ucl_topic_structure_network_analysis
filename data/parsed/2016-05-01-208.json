But on Saturday night more than 100 people gathered for the campaign launch of the Greens\u2019 candidate for Maribyrnong, Dr Olivia Ball, who told supporters that she was confident the Greens could gain a significant portion of the Labor vote in the coming election and claim the seat within a couple more.    Related: New Manus and Nauru operator signals plans to quit detention centre business    She plans to do so on the basis that many Melbournians, who have held regular and well-attended protests against the federal government\u2019s asylum seeker policy in recent months, are unable, she says, to see a strong point of difference between the Coalition and Labor\u2019s border protection policies. The latest protest on Saturday saw 500 people gather in the city, angered by the death of Omid, the 23-year-old Iranian refugee who died after setting himself alight in protest on Nauru. Ball obtained her PhD at the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law and is co-founder of Remedy Australia, which focuses on human rights violations as determined by the UN and advocates for proven violations to be remedied. After years of providing counselling and therapy for refugee survivors of torture, Ball has turned her attention to politics, saying the issue of asylum seekers was too urgent for her not to. \u201cCertainly asylum seeker policy is only one area of my work but we are highlighting it as a key weakness for the Labor party and I think it is the thing that upsets Labor supporters the most,\u201d Ball tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThere are people in this room tonight who have written to Shorten and said they can\u2019t bring themselves to support his party any more over the asylum seeker issue. We would like the Labor party to wake up to the enlightened, progressive constituency that don\u2019t see asylum seekers as threats and wants to welcome them to Australia.\u201d  On Thursday, Fairfax reported that a damaging split had emerged in federal Labor over asylum seeker policy, with four MPs \u2013 Melissa Parke, Lisa Singh, Jill Hall and Sue Lines \u2013 breaking ranks and calling for the 900 asylum seekers on Manus Island to be settled in Australia.  Sema Top, a longtime Labor voter who was at Ball\u2019s launch, says she is 95% sure she will vote Greens for the first time this election. \u201cBecause of their policy towards asylum seekers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s not much difference between Labor and Liberal at the moment.\u201d      Labor leader Bill Shorten at the University of Queensland Solar Research Facility at Gatton, west of Brisbane, last week. Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP    Her 22-year-old daughter, Eylul, who is a law student and Greens party member, agrees. \u201cA lot of Labor\u2019s policy on asylum seekers is the same the Coalition\u2019s; they just have a different way of putting it forward,\u201d she says. \u201cOver the last couple of years I think people have really started to understand the issues around asylum seekers and refugees and I think this year might be the year the Greens get significantly more support in Maribyrnong.\u201d The Greens hold the best chance of claiming more seats in the lower house in the increasingly gentrifying, northern suburbs electorates of Wills and Batman. But elections are about more than just winning. The Greens believe Maribyrnong, though unlikely to fall away from Labor any time soon, provides them with an opportunity to monopolise on discontent towards Labor and play the medium-term game. In the 2010 federal election, the Greens\u2019 Adam Bandt claimed victory in the seat of Melbourne after taking a 10.6% swing in what was then Australia\u2019s only Labor/Greens marginal seat. By the 2013 election, Bandt had clawed even more ground from Labor\u2019s Cath Bowtell, with his 43.7% of the primary vote an 8% improvement on his total in 2010. His win in the seat that had been held by Labor for more than 100 years was the result of a strong grassroots campaign that saw the party gradually gain disillusioned Labor voters over the years. They polled 19.0% in 2004, 22.8% in 2007 which saw them finish second after preferences, before the eventual 2010 victory.    We would like the Labor party to wake-up to the enlightened, progressive constituency  Olivia Ball     It\u2019s a situation Bandt tells the room at Ball\u2019s campaign launch he expects to see repeated in Maribyrnong within a couple of elections\u2019 time. Not only has the seat always been held by Labor \u2013 it has never been held by a woman. \u201cOne hundred and ten years of uninterrupted men is quite enough,\u201d Ball says. \u201cI am prepared to interrupt them.\u201d The Greens\u2019 policy on asylum seekers, Ball says, is to close offshore detention centres completely and use the savings from closing them to increase Australia\u2019s intake of people seeking asylum, which would increase from 13,700 to 50,000, including 10,000 under a new skilled refugee category. In a first for him, the high-profile human rights barrister Julian Burnside, who taken on asylum seeker cases pro-bono, is at Ball\u2019s launch to endorse her candidacy. He says he has long respected the tradition of the bar not to disclose alignment or biases towards or against political parties. \u201cSo to be speaking tonight is unusual for me and I had to think long and hard whether to do it, and if so why,\u201d he said. \u201cOur political system is, in my opinion, in really bad shape. Both major parties are a disgrace. I don\u2019t know if Olivia has a chance of winning this seat or not but what\u2019s important is the primary vote of both major parties falls. Because they will notice that.\u201d He later told Guardian Australia that while he was still not a member of any political party, nor encouraging people to specifically vote for the Greens, his view is that \u201cthe point of having a vote this year is that you can not vote for either of the major parties\u201d.

Photograph: Julia Meehan    \u201cAustralians think we are being protected from criminals through the current asylum seeker policy and that is probably the most dishonest piece of political rhetoric I\u2019ve ever experienced in my lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is interesting that Labor, to their eternal discredit, have never stood up to this lie. They wring their hands and go along with it.\u201d Asked by Guardian Australia for the key points of difference between Labor\u2019s asylum seeker and border protection policy and the Coalition\u2019s, Shorten replied that Labor policy was driven by a determination to stop people drowning at sea.  \u201cBy 2025, Labor will increase Australia\u2019s annual humanitarian intake to 27,000 \u2013 almost double the current intake,\u201d he said.  \u201cA Labor government will also provide significantly increased annual funding to the UNHCR for its global work program and its work in south-east Asia and the Pacific. Labor in government will take a leadership role to build a regional humanitarian framework to improve the situation of asylum seekers and Labor will reinstate references to the UN refugees convention in the Migration Act.\u201d   Related: Wife of man who died after setting fire to himself in Nauru slams delay in care    Labor would also increase independent oversight of offshore processing facilities, he said, and ensure that those working in the immigration system held whistleblower protections to allow them speak out about maladministration and corruption. The Green\u2019s border protection and asylum policy, he says, would \u201csee men, women and children drown at sea\u201d. Ball responded by saying the \u201cso-called drownings argument is a way of turning a blind eye to the suffering and deaths that occur out of sight\u201d. The Greens\u2019 refugee policy included measurers to discourage dangerous sea voyages, she said, including increasing Australia\u2019s funding to the UNHCR and similar organisations to quickly process refugee applications to intermediary countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, and would also allow asylum seekers to seek work and education while they waiting for their applications to be assessed. \u201cIf they can live a decent life with the right to work and education, people will be far less likely to engage in a very risky journey across the seas,\u201d Ball said. \u201cNobody wants to see people drowning at sea but it\u2019s a nonsense when you see the suffering we cause through current bipartisan refugee policies, which are totally illegal under international law and which are morally repugnant, to say people aren\u2019t being harmed in other ways.  \u201cIf Mr Shorten and Labor is genuinely concerned about the safety and welfare of those seeking asylum, he wouldn\u2019t support their arbitrary detention.\u201d",
