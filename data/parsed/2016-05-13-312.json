  "body": "Two days after the brutal murder of a PhD student in Egypt hit the headlines, I received a phone call from a family member. \u201cDid you hear about that Italian student?\u201d they asked.  I responded, truthfully, that it had made me feel sick.  Apart from being tragic beyond comprehension, the killing of Cambridge student Giulio Regeni served as a sobering reminder of the unpredictability and danger that researchers face in the field. I am currently conducting research in another Middle Eastern country known for its pervasive and brutal intelligence apparatus. Like Regeni, I am here as part of my PhD at a world-class UK university. I have good reason to believe that I have been monitored, both physically and electronically.    Related: Working as a casual? Zip your lip and do as you're told    I like to think that my research is benign and that the state\u2019s interest in me has passed, or will do soon. Then again, the arbitrary arrest and torture of students, academics and journalists in this country makes me feel afraid. Some days the risks seem non-existent, on others they can be absolutely terrifying.  My unease is deepened by the fact that my university seems to be utterly clueless when it comes to my security situation. Even broaching the topic feels like breaking a taboo.   Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t think any university or supervisor should have to take the blame for another country\u2019s violence. But it\u2019s naive to put the onus on students to figure out their field sites while imploring host countries to uphold freedom of research. In reality, intelligence agencies, armies and mobs will do as they please and students need to be prepared. Yet they often receive little help or advice. I flagged to my department that state monitoring is rife in my field site, but no one suggested that I seek anti-surveillance training. Not even the essentials were offered, like advice on encryption software, being careful about what you write over email and setting up password protections. My university does have an information security team that can help, but students are not told about it. I found out about its existence in a chance conversation with a friend.   Related: Giulio Regeni murder investigators from Italy and Egypt meet in Cairo    A colleague of mine is currently based in a highly militarised region of the Middle East where she has been exposed to extreme levels of violence. She has been physically attacked more than once, and her mental health has suffered. She wasn\u2019t given any training on how to handle a conflict situation \u2013 either physically or mentally \u2013 and neither have her supervisors, who don\u2019t know how to support her. Meanwhile, the aid workers around her benefit from support structures put in place by their organisations, including exit strategies, text message alerts and emergency contacts. There are many PhD students like us scattered around the globe, undertaking fieldwork in the face of risks that we (and our universities) are often oblivious to. This is even more frightening when you consider that many of us are stationed in our field sites for a minimum of nine months, learning the language as we go and organising ground support on our own.  Universities may point to the risk assessments that students have to complete before they go into the field. These are helpful in theory \u2013 but they put the onus of risk identification and mitigation firmly on students. My colleagues and I found ourselves filling out forms listing risk after risk and how we would mitigate them, but these were approved without any subsequent training from the university.  When things do go wrong, pressure is too often placed on supervisors to provide a solution. This is unfair. Supervisors are not safety experts; they may not even have been to the country in question. Nobody in my department researches my field site.    Related: The pressure of academia drove me to heroin    As young researchers, we are perversely encouraged to be grateful for a lack of red tape from our universities, which could inhibit our research. Yet the solution surely isn\u2019t less security, but better training and support. Simple things \u2013 like keeping a regular communication plan so that people can react quickly if you go missing \u2013 can save lives. Professional bodies have been using such techniques for years. They haven\u2019t made it into academia and I\u2019m not sure why. Nothing can excuse the threats that researchers face in certain countries, but universities are places of learning, and wherever possible, that should include teaching students to stay safe. This may not be enough to prevent violence in every case, but that\u2019s no reason to leave endangered students out in the cold.
