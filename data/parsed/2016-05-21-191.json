  "body": "I put down the bank statement and groan. Were this an old TV ad, the music would begin, the characters would suddenly start dancing and Nat King Cole would\u00a0break into song \u2013 \u201cThere may be trouble ahead, but while there\u2019s moonlight and music and love and romance, let\u2019s face the music and dance.\u201d Well, I\u2019m not dancing but I am drinking \u2013 a large glass of Italian red \u2013 as I contemplate the cost of music lessons, grocery shopping, holidays, ballet, mortgage, car and a whole new raft of childcare costs that, with Helen\u2019s death, will now come out of one salary. I look again at the list of outgoings and wonder how I, of all people, could\u00a0have ended up underinsured. Back in the day, I\u2019d massively admired that Dennis Potter-inspired 1990s television advert. It featured a bloke on\u00a0an operating trolley hearing surgeons find unexpected problems, a\u00a0man overhearing in the toilet that he\u2019d been made redundant, a middle-aged couple dealing with the discovery of a positive pregnancy test that is not their daughter\u2019s but the wife\u2019s and even the grim reaper warning an overworked commuter. They all ended\u00a0in the line \u201cFor the life you don\u2019t yet know.\u201d At the time, I\u2019d been working with a number of life insurance companies and one day had gone out with Barry, a top insurance salesmen, who\u2019d tell me, \u201cDeath is such a tough subject to talk to couples about that you almost have to reverse a hearse up to their front door and let them smell the flowers!\u201d The form this took was to get a husband and wife to both fill in estimates of how much money would\u00a0be needed if\u00a0the wife/mother died. Almost always, the husband would call it ridiculously low and his\u00a0wife would be spot on. During the row that followed, no selling was required by Barry to make the\u00a0sale. The problem with developing life insurance ads has always been that one couldn\u2019t make a life-changing event too dreadful as absolute grief would be the problem not money. In truth, they shouldn\u2019t have worried. I know beyond any doubt that the time between the death of a loved one and the first financial fear for the future barely leaves time for the last note of the funeral\u2019s final hymn to fade. Despite my knowing the devils of under-insurance, helped by Barry\u2019s spiv-edged master class, I\u2019d had the usual denial and lack of interest, fear and avoidance of acknowledging death and planning for it. It meant that Helen and I were far from well covered. I take a deep gulp of the barolo (an indulgence whose days may be numbered). Had I died, Helen would have received a ton of cash due to our payout being bolstered by my major death-in-service cover at work. The kids would have their mum and the household few\u00a0money worries. In fact, we\u2019d joked, \u201cTo find a new husband you\u2019ll need all the cash you can get \u2013 new clothes, sports car, boob job, etc,\u201d \u2013 this in the days when an early death for either of\u00a0us seemed so unlikely as to be laughable. But at 3am in Helen\u2019s study, I look miserably at her finances, seeing that pretty much all her salary paid for childcare. This shows how much she loved her job. I made\u00a0the usual mistake of thinking only of the mortgage, not our ongoing\u00a0lifestyle as a single-salary household. Our brilliant nanny, Annie, who had been with us for 10 years and allowed us both to work, whom Millie and Matt need more than ever, requires getting on for half my gross salary. Christ! All of that is sustainable if I keep my job and income stable. But my job means travelling regularly \u2013 and how sustainable is that with two children who already show signs of hating me being away and massive anxiety that something else bad will happen? I might need to work less intensely or not at all for a while. Trouble ahead? I pick up the glass and take another hefty swig. I\u2019m not a financial adviser but consider yourselves nagged \u2013 check and improve your cover now. So if, heaven forbid, the worst happens, you can raise your own glass to me because it won\u2019t be money worries that stop you dancing. Cheers. Adam Golightly is a pseudonym",
