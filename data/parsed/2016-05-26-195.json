  "body": "Revived to mark the centenary year of the battle of the Somme, Frank McGuinness\u2019s play is a great act of theatrical generosity. Those who saw the first production in 1985 may have expected an author from republican County Donegal to have set a wartime drama among the Roman Catholics he\u2019d grown up with. Instead, the troops who file into the makeshift barracks are sash-wearing Protestants from Belfast\u2019s dockyards, Coleraine\u2019s factories and the churches of Enniskillen. They prepare for battle in the trenches of the first world war with the same never-surrender defiance that characterises their historical defence of Ulster. McGuinness paints them with sympathy and understanding. For all their knee-jerk Fenian bashing, they are honest men, proud of their culture, firm in their beliefs and as vulnerable in the face of the enemy as anyone. \u201cWe\u2019re not making a sacrifice,\u201d says one as the deadliest battle approaches. \u201cWe are the sacrifice.\u201d Contrasting the bluff bravado of the frontline with the home truths of their brief time on leave, the playwright exposes the fears, insecurities, loves and passions of a generation seemingly cursed to face an early death. By the play\u2019s inevitably tragic end, he sensitises us not only to the war\u2019s futile loss of life \u2013 the conventional narrative of the great war \u2013 but also its damage to a way of life. Without being blind to the contradictions and conflicts of Protestant Ulster, he offers a moving image of a community bound by shared experience and common humanity. The compassion shown by McGuinness in his writing seems to be in shorter supply, however, in Jeremy Herrin\u2019s production. A four-theatre collaboration setting out on an extensive UK and Ireland tour, it\u2019s a hard show to warm to; one that\u2019s keener to show us the morose, irascible side of the eight soldiers \u2013 a side that is undeniably there \u2013 than the qualities that will ultimately bind them together.     Paul Kennedy in Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, at Citizens theatre, Glasgow. Photograph: Johann Persson    It\u2019s a question of tone. The introductory monologue delivered by Se\u00e1n McGinley as Old Kenneth Pyper, the one soldier who survives to tell the tale, is rightly full of rage at a scale of horror that \u201chas no shape\u201d. But here, it also comes across as overheated, too strident to draw us into the subtlety of the playwright\u2019s argument.  Likewise, Donal Gallery succeeds in making the young Pyper as irritating as an upper-class smartarse would surely be among working-class soldiers. His supercilious manner is, however, at the expense of any redeeming feature, making a character who is central to the narrative more alienating than maverick. Similarly, Andy Kellegher and Paul Kennedy as the shipyard workers Anderson and McIlwaine have a stridency that speaks volumes about their urban lives, but too little sense of the joy that underscores their quick-witted repartee. Coupled with the blood-red skies of Ciaran Bagnall\u2019s austere set, ferociously lit by Paul Keogan, it makes for a dark, brooding production that is too low on contrast to do justice to the play\u2019s rich humanity. \u2022At Citizens, Glasgow, until 4 June. Box office: 0141-429 0022. Then touring until 8 October.",
