  "body": "This extraordinary album, authored by the artist formerly known as Antony and the Johnsons, is all about radical changes, and radical change. Having excised the letter T, Antony is now Anohni, bringing both brand and public face in line with Anohni\u2019s long-held female identification among intimates. Gone are the Johnsons, the non-ensemble who used to underscore Antony\u2019s emotive vibrato. Two digital producers at the vanguard of electronica replace them \u2013 Hudson Mohawke and Oneohtrix Point Never.    On Watch Me, the US National Security Agency is cast as a father figure whose attentiveness is downright sinister    Anohni is hopping mad, and more sorrowful than the journalistic PJ Harvey, an obvious fellow traveller on the road of pop\u2019s engagement with the wider world. Hopelessness takes the tragedies of our age \u2013 ecocide, drone warfare, loss of liberty \u2013 and confronts them with the aid of muscular electronic tunes. On one level, Hopelessness is the record you were hoping Anohni might someday make after Blind, her 2008 collaboration with Hercules and Love Affair, when one of this generation\u2019s most distinct voices \u2013 part Alison Moyet, part Nina Simone, and yet all Anohni \u2013 abandoned the piano for some club sounds. Hopelessness finally busts Anohni\u2019s oceanic pipes out of the somewhat tight corner in which they have been cloistered since her 2005 Mercury win with I Am a Bird Now, and lets them rip over crunching beats, the kind that inhabit the mainstream.         4 Degrees by Anohni.    Last year\u2019s 4 Degrees was a powerful opening gambit. The gist of the album is in Anohni\u2019s takedown of irreversible climate change, in the chorus you can sing along to. \u201cI want to see the animals dying in the trees,\u201d she howls, playing devil\u2019s advocate about what will happen if we don\u2019t curb emissions, massively, by yesterday. Drone Bomb Me \u2013 the second taster \u2013 is even better: sung in the voice of a young Afghan girl, begging for death since her family are all gone. \u201cLet me be the one you choose tonight,\u201d Anohni sings, an anguished play on pop coquettishness. On Watch Me, the US National Security Agency is cast as a father figure whose attentiveness is controlling and downright sinister. \u201cI know you love me/ Cos you\u2019re always watching me,\u201d Anohni coos, while HudMo and Oneohtrix pour out the contents of their toy boxes in a deluge of foxy digitals. Anohni\u2019s stated mission \u2013 to smuggle polemical content in through pop Trojan horses \u2013 is accomplished here. The subject matter, then, is unrelenting. But Anohni\u2019s impassioned delivery succeeds in making ecstatic music out of it, carried along by propulsive soundbeds; music that is equal to the apocalypse. There\u2019s room for art, too. Most startling of all these songs, perhaps, is Obama, where Anohni accesses her lowest register to take the outgoing president to task over a legacy of kill lists. There\u2019s a hint of Indian devotional music to her vocal, or perhaps the call to prayer.",
