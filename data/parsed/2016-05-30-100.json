  "body": "One of Spain\u2019s most famous athletes, the basketball player Pau Gasol, has said he is considering skipping this summer\u2019s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro due to fears over the Zika virus.  Gasol said he has spoken to other athletes who were considering whether to compete at the Games. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see some athletes deciding not to participate in the games to avoid putting their health and the health of their families at risk,\u201d Gasol, who plays for the Chicago Bulls, said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about [whether to go]. Just like every athlete, or any other person considering going to Rio, should be thinking about it.\u201d  Gasol has won the NBA title twice and is a six-time All-Star. He also enrolled in medical school before pursuing a basketball career, and his mother is a doctor. Zika virus can cause birth defects if mothers are infected, and he said the illness is a worry for many athletes.   Related: WHO rejects call to move Rio Olympics because of Zika virus     \u201cSome of these athletes [I spoke to] are planning to have children in the near future and this could affect them, it could affect the health of their kids and their wives,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cTheir health should come first.\u201d The World Health Organisation recently dismissed calls for the Games to be moved but Gasol said athletes needed more information before taking a decision. \u201cWe need to understand the seriousness of the situation,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cEven though there are some soothing words being said, we know that there are different opinions about the subject.\u201d Gasol, who won silver medals with Spain at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, retains an interest in medicine and said he had consulted experts in the field as he considers whether to compete. \u201cI feel responsible to know more about the situation and to inform everyone about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to talk openly about this. It\u2019s a very delicate situation.\u201d Gasol is not the first high-profile athlete to express concerns about Zika. Last week, the golfer and four-time major champion Rory McIlroy said that although he plans to compete he is still assessing his options. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point in the next couple of years where we [McIlroy and his fianc\u00e9e, Erica Stoll] are going to have to think about starting a family. Right now I\u2019m ready to go but I don\u2019t want anything to affect that.\u201d",
