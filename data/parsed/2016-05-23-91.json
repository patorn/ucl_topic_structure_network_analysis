  "body": "Halfway through their hit song With or Without EU, Dave Bono gestured towards George the Edge instructing him to turn the volume down. Moments later, when a reverent silence filled the room, Dave Bono started a meaningful slow hand clap. One by one, the hand-picked audience of employees who fancied an hour off work joined in this rhythmic communion.   \u201cHello Southampton,\u201d Dave Bono drawled. \u201cEvery time I clap my hand another person in the UK loses their job. Think about it.\u201d George the Edge peeled off a power chord and the band went straight back into the chorus. \u201cWith or without EU \u2026\u201d The audience all yelled: \u201cWith.\u201d   Related: Cameron warns against 'self-destruct' vote to leave EU     The atrium of the B&Q headquarters on England\u2019s south coast was not the most likely venue for the latest gig in EU2\u2019s Rolling Thunder Bankruptcy Referendum tour, but it served a purpose. If only as the punchy bass line for the gag \u201cLeaving the EU will bring on a DIY recession\u201d, which was repeated far more times than was strictly necessary. Subtlety has never been EU2\u2019s strong point. EU2 did not get where they are today by overestimating the intelligence of their fans \u2013 though it\u2019s quite possible they did get where they are today by overestimating quite a few other things.  George the Edge looked washed out, having spent the past few nights on a Treasury bender trying to finalise his short-term forecasts of the economic consequences of Britain leaving the EU, and was happy to let his frontman make the introductions. \u201cAs a songwriter, I\u2019ve always wanted to be on the right track,\u201d said a tanned Dave Bono. \u201cAnd leaving the EU would be taking the wrong track.\u201d It\u2019s those kind of sun-kissed, philosophical insights that have made him an idol to millions around the globe.   \u201cThe first track I want to sing for you today is off our new album,\u201d Dave Bono continued. \u201cIt\u2019s called The Economic is the Moral, and it goes like this \u2026 If the rich lose some cash / Then they still have a stash / But when the poor lose their dosh / They are under the cosh / And in this money war / I\u2019m on the side of the poor.\u201d Or to put it another way, most of the leading Brexit campaigners were breadheads who weren\u2019t that bothered if the economy tanked or not. It was one of EU2\u2019s better numbers.  With the audience warmed up, George the Edge was ready to step in and slow things down for a while. To keep in time with the economy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play two versions of our hit You\u2019re Never Going to Find what You\u2019re Looking For,\u201d he said coyly. The first was the shock scenario where GDP falls by 3.6%, unemployment goes up by 500,000, wages fall by 2.8%, sterling falls by 12% and everyone goes hungry. The second was the severe shock scenario in which GDP falls by 6%, unemployment goes up by 820,000, wages fall by by 4%, sterling falls by 15% and bodies pile up in the streets.   Related: Tory men dominate EU referendum coverage, study finds     Having strummed his way through both versions, George the Edge decided that, on balance, he much preferred the severe shock scenario. It had a much stronger hook and the audience looked far more concerned.  Some even dared to suggest that the figures might have come with a bit of artistic licence. George the Edge was outraged. \u201cAll our figures are based on detailed and rigorous analysis,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve even found an economist who thinks my estimates might be reasonably reasonable. Just take a look at my vector auto-regression equation on page 66. If everyone doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re going to end up totally broke after seeing a vector auto-regression equation like that, then what\u2019s the point of anything?\u201d  Dave Bono nodded earnestly. It would be so much easier if he just did not care. But he couldn\u2019t help caring, because that\u2019s the kind of philanthropic guy he was. He had single-handedly saved Africa, now he was going to single-handedly save the UK. Time to do the totally catastrophic scenario in which Govey and Boris were in charge, every hospital closed and a tidal wave swamped the country ripping out signposts from every street. Where the Streets have no Name. If that didn\u2019t bring the house \u2013 and its price \u2013 down, then nothing would.",
