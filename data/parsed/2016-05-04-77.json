It doesn\u2019t mean enough, ever, quite.\u201d  The 83-year-old English artist is in New York for an exhibition of new and recent works at Gagosian gallery, entitled From Memory. It is an exhilarating display by an artist at the peak of his powers: Hodgkin may be elderly but his work is far from frail.  We meet in the gallery along with his partner of 32 years, the music writer Antony Peattie. Hodgkin\u2019s hair is silver and short, his eyes rheumy and penetrating. Dressed in blues and blacks, his subdued clothing is in contrast to the voluptuous backdrop \u2013 nobody does colour quite like Hodgkin, and this exhibition is no exception.  Hodgkin is now more prolific than ever. \u201cI realize there isn\u2019t much time left,\u201d says the artist, who won the Turner prize in 1985 and was knighted in 1992. Old age has been freeing: \u201cLots of things that I used to worry about in my work, I don\u2019t any more because I know the answers to them. It clarifies things wonderfully.\u201d What he wants to achieve with his art has become \u201cmore straightforward\u201d, he says: \u201cmaximum expression\u201d.     Hodgkin in front of his work Blackmail. Photograph: Charlotte Burns for the Guardian    The paintings evoke private memories and are saturated in emotion. Joy in its abundance leaps from Love Song, a sizeable work on wood daubed in splashes of blue, white and green. Dirty Window feels grubby and sexy and secret, as does Bedclothes, from the same years (2014-15). There is tumult in the oranges, reds, greens, browns and plum of Blackmail, while Puddle is intimate in its simplicity, in its blue smears and empty space. From Memory is a riff on melancholy in browns, blues and blacks. We head to Hodgkin\u2019s beloved India in The Rains Came, as the heavens drench the dirt, while Green Monsoon is darker, closer to the heart of things. Hodgkin\u2019s feelings run famously close to the surface. At several points during our interview his shoulders shudder with sudden emotion as he stifles a sob or laugh, eyes widening in shock at each eruption. He is \u201ca man who loves and hates with a passion, and is very emotional. He will cry very easily and flares up, both in terms of colour and of temper, very quickly,\u201d said the Tate director, Nicholas Serota, in 2001. Serota, who gave Hodgkin his first museum show in 1976, said then that Hodgkin\u2019s passions had become \u201cmuch more evident in the paintings over the last 15 years or so\u201d. Now, 15 years later, this is truer than ever.      The Rains Came, 2014. \u00a9 Howard Hodgkin. Courtesy the artist and Gagosian Gallery    Ghosts of the past are on Hodgkin\u2019s mind. He remembers the policeman who said that Hodgkin\u2019s career choice seemed like a very good idea when, as a young boy he ran away from school because he wanted to be an artist. He weeps at the memory of his father and a dead relative known as \u201crich cousin within the family\u201d, the painter Eliot Hodgkin. \u201cHe was one of the most influential people in my life \u2026 an amazing person. He was the first man I\u2019ve ever come across who had bespoke suits made of silk,\u201d Hodgkin says, smiling in amazement.  He remembers cruelties well, too. His mother, a \u201ccomplicated woman\u201d whose \u201conly freedom was to seduce almost any grand person that she happened to come across\u201d was mindful of the social opprobrium in having a runaway artist as a son and encouraged him to become a diplomat (\u201cI said I would have started world wars\u201d). Hodgkin, who once said he found his voice very young but didn\u2019t quite know what to do with it, did not receive recognition until the 1970s, much later than peers such as David Hockney. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt I was a great success,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while I felt like an outcast in the art world because nobody really seemed to take what I did seriously at all.\u201d This led to periods of despair \u2013 about 50 years ago he contemplated jumping in front of a train. \u201cFocus in particular was essential, which was very difficult to do in the context of an ordinary middle-class life,\u201d he says. \u201cEventually, everything fell into place.\u201d Now, recognition has come \u2013 \u201cat last\u201d, he says.      From Memory, 2014\u201315. \u00a9 Howard Hodgkin. Courtesy the artist and Gagosian Gallery    Asked when and how his confidence developed, Hodgkin gestures at Peattie. Great love helps, he says, shrugging. Another \u201cgigantic step\u201d was a major exhibition of his works at London\u2019s Hayward Gallery in 1996, which marked the moment, he says, \u201cwhen I began to feel like yes, I could\u201d. I went to see the show as a schoolgirl and it made me determined to work with art: I\u2019d never seen such audacious colour or pictures that refused to stay in their frames. It felt like permission to see the world differently, and I left the Hayward amazed that art could do such a thing, in such a modern way.  Hodgkin famously paints up to the very edge of the painting, often covering the frame. It is a form of control, making sure that the object\u2019s completeness cannot be interrupted by a frame placed around it by somebody else. For similar reasons, he paints on board instead of canvas: \u201cA firm surface won\u2019t answer back. It just remains there, and that\u2019s very important to have. So much of my working isn\u2019t fixed, so it\u2019s wonderful that this is fixed, it\u2019s firm; there it is. I\u2019ve always thought that the first thing that painting should be is a thing \u2013 paintings should be like objects that exist firmly.\u201d Why is that so important \u2013 because everything else is so fleeting? \u201cProbably, yes. They have to be complete in themselves.\u201d Painting remains a gruelling endeavour. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly lonely,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t make up for it by \u2013 and don\u2019t misunderstand this \u2013 by the interest of you. It\u2019s still very lonely. Being alone in the studio \u2013 I don\u2019t paint listening to music, I don\u2019t paint surrounded by the objects I collect. It\u2019s just me.\u201d      No hiding place: Hodgkin\u2019s London studio in an old dairy building. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    The loneliness is \u201cessential\u201d, says Hodgkin, whose London studio is relentlessly white and bright, with no corners to hide in. The artist has said that the biggest challenge is to sit still, holding one\u2019s own hand and resisting the urge to rush at the painting. But his patience has increased with age: these new works are more restrained than the earlier paintings, leaving more unsaid.  He is preparing for an exhibition at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery of his portraits \u2013 a form that, as an abstract artist, he is not often associated with. But he painted lots of portraits in the 1960s of artists such as Patrick Caulfield, whom he admired greatly. The museum would like him to paint a new portrait or two, though Hodgkin doesn\u2019t yet have a subject in mind. He falls silent for a few moments then says: \u201cSo many people that I loved and admired and so on are dead already. I\u2019ve reached that age. Somehow it never seemed real to me when I read about it happening to other people.\u201d Surveying the Gagosian exhibition, he says: \u201cLike so many ageing artists, I don\u2019t think this is the best work \u2013 I am sure there is more to come.\u201d Does he allow himself to experience moments of triumph in his work? \u201cYes, but they\u2019re not real because they can\u2019t be,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the triumph lasts a very short time indeed.\u201d For Hodgkin, the success of each work is only ever a lonely note in a larger song, and so he keeps painting.
