Having only spent \u00a3260m in less than two years, underdog champ Louis van Gaal will reportedly see out the final year of his contract and has set his sights on another summer of sticking it to The Man. And by sticking it, the Mill means spending it. And by The Man, the Mill means money.  Top of the shopping list is Mill fave Renato Sanches, the wonderfully dreadlocked 18-year-old Benfica midfielder who only made his first-team debut in October and who was rather less gloriously sent off on Sunday. After literally minutes of negotiation, Ed Woodward has withdrawn his feet from under the bargaining table, removed his wraparound Oakley sunglasses from his face, smirked, tossed \u00a363m on to said table (said to be paid in two \u20ac40m payments) and walked out into the glorious sunshine we\u2019ve been having recently and fumbling around in his pocket for those damn sunglasses.  But Louis and Ed aren\u2019t done there. Rafa Silva, another young buck pulling up trees at Braga, has been widely touted for a move to Manchester, not least by his own agent, Antonio Araujo. \u201cOur client, Rafa Silva, sees with very good eyes the possibility of playing in the Premier League,\u201d he told Sport Witness. \u201cWe are working towards achieving this objective.\u201d Liverpool are also said to be keen on the Portuguese international, before his stock potentially rises at Euro 2016. Liverpool have also realised that they might enter next season without Mamadou Sakho and with Dejan Lovren, Joel Matip, Martin Skrtel, Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Tiago Ilori in central defence and reckon there is room for one more body in the shape of Stuttgart\u2019s Antonio Rudiger, currently on loan at Roma. The German would cost \u00a315m, although another Antonio, Conte, has left a trail of tenners that lead to Chelsea in the hope that the 23-year-old might follow them instead.  Premier League overlords Leicester City are, perhaps unsurprisingly, also keen on importing from Italy, although they, perhaps unsurprisingly, want someone that nobody apart from Steve Walsh, James Richardson and Paolo Bandini has ever heard of before: Serie B striker Gianluca Lapadula. The Pescara 26-year-old has scored 24 goals this season and the club\u2019s president has revealed he has spoken to the nicest man in football. \u201cI received a phone call from Claudio Ranieri some time ago, before Leicester were crowned Premier League champions,\u201d Daniele Sebastiani said. \u201cIt was a courtesy call [of course] where we talked about football and he confided to me that he is following our striker with interest. It was not anything official, but only interest.\u201d The Mill doesn\u2019t see how they could, but should Ranieri\u2019s charms fail, Leicester will take an improved punt at CSKA Moscow\u2019s Ahmed Musa, having had a bid of \u00a317m rejected in January. No Mill would be complete without Arsenal lining up a bid for an up-and-coming star, and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger duly obliges in the form of Rob Holding, who the Sun has claimed has \u201cenjoyed a stunning breakthrough campaign\u201d in Bolton\u2019s back four, a defence that has conceded just 81 goals on the way to finishing rock-bottom of the Championship. \u00a35m should do the trick. 2016-17, watch out!",
