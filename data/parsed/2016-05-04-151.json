  "body": "The releases of recordings from the Progetto Martha Argerich, the festival over which the great lady presides each June in the Swiss resort of Lugano, have become one of the most reliable annual fixtures in the CD calendar. The latest compilation is more or less the mixture as before, bringing together musicians from several generations with whom Argerich has worked regularly or whose careers she has closely monitored, and featuring a range of mainstream chamber works as well as historical rarities and arrangements for multiple pianos. Argerich fans are always looking for additions to her personal discography, too, and they get a couple here. She joins Lilya Zilberstein in Debussy\u2019s two-piano arrangement of Schumann\u2019s Six Canonic Studies Op 56, originally written for pedal piano; and with Eduardo Hubert as the other soloist and the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana under Alexander Vedernikov, she takes on Porte\u00f1a (Latitude 34\u00b0 36\u00b0 30\u00b0), for two pianos and orchestra, a rather gruesome, sub-Piazzolla portrait of Buenos Aires by film-score composer Luis Bacalov. Otherwise, she partners Alexander Mogilevsky in Schubert\u2019s Variations in A flat, D813, the violinist G\u00e9za Hosszu-Legocky in an arrangement of Bartok\u2019s Romanian Dances, and joins Stephen Kovacevich for a rather stormy, fierce account of Debussy\u2019s En Blanc et Noir, a work they recorded together in the 1970s.     Supple account of Brahms clarinet trio \u2026 the cellist Gautier Capu\u00e7on. Photograph: Michael Tammaro    Otherwise, the repertoire ranges from a piano quintet by Ferdinand Ries to suites for three pianos from Philip Glass\u2019s dance opera Les Enfants Terribles, and Alberto Ginastera\u2019s ballet Estancia, via Turina, Poulenc and quite a lot of Brahms. Best of all, perhaps, are a fabulously supple account of Brahms\u2019s late Clarinet Trio, with Paul Meyer, Gautier Capu\u00e7on and Nicholas Angelich, and the same composer\u2019s Horn Trio, Op 40, in an arrangement that replaces the horn with a viola. It sounds a very different beast without the power and eloquence of the brass instrument, but it\u2019s done with great care and awareness by Nathan Braude, Ilya Gringolts and Mogilevsky, and there is still the sense of occasion and uniqueness that you seem to get with everything that comes out of these Lugano gatherings.",
