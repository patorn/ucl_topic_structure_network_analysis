But one of my favourite places to celebrate carnaval is in the colonial city of Olinda in Brazil\u2019s north-east. Before and during carnival, giant puppets roam the streets accompanied by brass bands and dancers. It\u2019s not as slick as the Rio parade but more family-friendly, a real folk festival.     Fran Bryson \u2026 \u2018Whatever it is, Brazilians throw themselves into it one million per cent\u2019    There\u2019s a surprise around every corner in Brazil. Many westerners assume that because Brazil was colonised by Europeans, it will be familiar, but the non-European influence in the country is profound. Brazil had more \u2013 a lot more \u2013 African slaves than the US, and their cultural influence runs deep. You see it not only in faces but in other fundamental ways, like the rhythms of Brazilian music.  The African influence is also obvious in the huge range of religions. Religion in my world tends to be a sombre business but in Brazil they are vibrant, vigorous and animated \u2013 and they all borrow from each other. You\u2019ll find deities from African-rooted Candombl\u00e9 depicted next to an image of the Virgin Mary. And religious activity in Brazil is accompanied by music that, at the very least, makes you want to tap your foot or, more often, leap up and dance as if it\u2019s your last day on Earth. In my first months in Brazil, I noticed plastic, wooden or wax limbs for sale: legs, arms, livers, ears, breasts and more. I was confused, not having had much contact with Catholicism. Ex-votos, I learned, can also be objects. I\u2019ve seen miniature cars, townhouses, churches, motorcycle helmets and ballgowns used to thank the saints (and Brazil has many popular saints) for interventions such as good exam results, lotto wins or cancer cures.

The healer-medium reputedly channels spirits such as King Solomon and St Francis of Assisi. Some days, as many as 2,000 people seek his help. On some, he performs invisible surgery, and sometimes he operates live on the stage. They show it on giant screens as you wait in the queues to see him \u2013 it\u2019s pretty gruesome. I dressed in white, as everyone does, and joined the flock of patients moving towards the healing centre. I felt like an extra in an episode of Doctor Who.

Photograph: Getty Images    Ayahuasca, a hallucinogen, is the central tool of certain Brazilian cults. I visited the headquarters of one, the Santo Daime, whose whole religious practice relies on taking the drug. Their mother-church is in the Amazon jungle, two days by road and river from the nearest city. Ayahuasca, the drinking of which is compulsory for all ceremony attendees, is supposed to heighten your senses, sometimes provide telepathic abilities and bring you closer to God and the spirits. But it only brought me closer to a porcelain-covered hole in the ground as I expelled everything except, in all likelihood, my demons. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not vegetarian because the best dishes in Brazil feature meat. In churrascarias (barbecue restaurants), waiters walk around with huge skewers of meat \u2013 lamb, beef, chicken livers, wings and chorizo sausage. My favourite is a chain called Fogo de Ch\u00e3o. On the table is a little disc that\u2019s red on one side and green on the other. Green side up means they\u2019ll stop and carve meat directly on to your plate. Red side up means you\u2019re taking a rest. Problem is, I forget to put the red side up because I\u2019m too distracted by the sheer theatre of it.

Photograph: PR    This may sound a little strange but I really like some of Brazil\u2019s borders. In Australia, as with the UK, our borders are defined by ocean. They\u2019re solid, substantial, obvious. There\u2019s a dusty town in the far south where horse-drawn carts are still a common sight. On the Brazilian side of the street the town is spelled Chu\u00ed and on the Uruguayan side it\u2019s Chuy. I once crossed that road \u2013 the border \u2013 about 10 times in five minutes, just because I could. You can shop on either side using either country\u2019s currency. If you\u2019re in Rio, take the ferry across Guanabara Bay to Niter\u00f3i and walk to the Museum of Contemporary Art, a saucer-shaped modernist structure designed by Oscar Niemeyer. The views across the water to Rio are spectacular. Grab a beer from a kiosk and sit and watch the planes take off from the city\u2019s domestic airport \u2013 they seem to float off the ground, rising in front of the looming figure of Christ, then bank to avoid Sugar Loaf mountain.     Museum of Contemporary Art in Niter\u00f3i has stunning views back to Rio. Photograph: Alamy    I discovered the best Brazilian breakfast, tapioca pancakes, in Macei\u00f3, capital of the small north-eastern state of Alagoas. It\u2019s a sweet city that doesn\u2019t see many foreign tourists. Between the main road and the beach are kiosks that offer pancakes with toppings sweet or savoury \u2013 they\u2019re perfect for breakfast or a snack on the way to the long beach that flanks the city. The commitment, effort and enthusiasm that Brazilians put into everything they do fills me with admiration. Whether it\u2019s a religious event, a soccer game, a festival or carnival, Brazilians throw themselves into it one million per cent \u2013 it\u2019s like they have an obligation to do so. \u2022 Fran Bryson is the author of In Brazil (Scribe, \u00a314.99).
