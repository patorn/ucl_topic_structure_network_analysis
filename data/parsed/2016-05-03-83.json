  "body": "If you\u2019d had to guess which rock/funk legend was going to die in 2016, Sly Stone would have been much higher up on the list than Prince. Stone, at 73, is 16 years older than Prince, and besides that has been ill for decades. Sly\u2019s career was derailed by addiction in the 1970s, and he never recovered. Comeback effort after comeback effort fizzled, royalty disputes festered, and for a time he was living in a recreational vehicle. Given his lack of public profile and his history of addiction, many people have assumed he died years ago.   Related: Sly Stone awarded $5m in unpaid royalties    Even when Stone does pass on (hopefully many years from now), there\u2019s unlikely to be a Prince or Bowie sized outpouring of grief \u2013 and think-pieces. Though Sly\u2019s widely acknowledged as a rock legend, after 40 years out of the spotlight he barely figures in pop culture. You can gauge the extent of Stone\u2019s marginalization by the reaction to the death last year of his collaborator and the mother of one of his children, legendary funk trumpeter and singer Cynthia Robinson. She received brief obituaries, but people on social media hardly noticed.  Stone may not be much thought about, but his music still sounds startlingly current. More than George Clinton, more than James Brown, more even perhaps than Prince, Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s hits foreshadow the bricolage construction and magpie eclecticism of hip-hop. The first track on Sly Stone\u2019s first album, 1967\u2019s A Whole New Thing, opens with what is effectively a proto-sample: a horn riff from, of all things, Fr\u00e8re Jacques.             He continued to use quotations throughout his career \u2013 Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) name-drops his own earlier hits; I Don\u2019t Know (Satisfaction) is a stoned, stunned remix of the Stones hit. But even when he was writing entirely new material, his songs sound like they\u2019re built out of bits and pieces glued together; Dylan\u2019s harmonica, Motown grooves, rock guitar sting, Stax horns \u2013 everything went into mix, not blended together but turned into a single psychedelic explosion. Sing a Simple Song, perhaps the funkiest track ever recorded, has been sampled hundreds of times, which makes sense since it sounds as though it\u2019s built out of samples. Vocals, horn beats and bass burps zip in and out of the staggering beat, while Sly\u2019s own shouted disembodied cry of ecstasy pans from channel to channel, foreshadowing generations of funk studio trickery to come. You can hear everyone from George Clinton to Public Enemy to De La Soul to Timbaland to FKA twigs to Kendrick Lamar to, of course, Prince taking notes at each \u201ctry a little Do! Re! Me!\u201d Sly is the place you go if you want to learn how to smash a song apart and reassemble the broken pieces into something weirder, funkier and better. Stone\u2019s message also continues to resonate. It\u2019s a cliche by now to talk about the transition from his earlier, optimistic flower power hits to his later downer mumbled grooves. There certainly is a contrast between Everyday People, and 1971\u2019s There\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On, which starts with Sly muttering: \u201cFeel so good, don\u2019t wanna move.\u201d But the truth is Sly always mixed irony, hope and despair, balancing the sunny dynamics of his (pre-Prince) multi-gendered and racially integrated band with his studio play-every-instrument-himself control freak insularity. Thank You For Talking to Me Africa, his ominous, slowed-down, screwed-and-chopped-before-there-was-screwed-and-chopped remix of Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) can be heard either as a statement of black pride and resistance or as a bitter comment on the end of the civil rights movement\u2019s racial idealism, or as both. In any case, \u201cLookin\u2019 at the devil / grinnin\u2019 at his gun / fingers start shakin\u2019 / I begin to run\u201d could have been written yesterday for the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 as could \u201cIf I could do it all over again / I\u2019d be in the same skin I\u2019m in\u201d, from his last classic, 1973\u2019s Fresh.             And then there\u2019s the early, cheerful-sounding Run, Run, Run, where the bright chimes and doo-wop Beach Boy harmonies provide a backdrop for a bleak, blunt assessment of white America. \u201cDon\u2019t try to figure out what\u2019s happenin\u2019 inside their heads / Ain\u2019t too much goin\u2019 on inside the head of the dead.\u201d When Robinson shouts, \u201cPeople, listen!\u201d it\u2019s part call to party, part warning \u2013 the ambivalence only underlined when the rest of the band takes it up in sweet harmonizing. Stone\u2019s mixture of joy and paranoia doesn\u2019t seem too dated for 2016; if anything, it seems too pointed. Prince and Bowie both in their ways took the 60s as a touchstone for eccentric, and erotic, transcendence. Stone, even at his happiest, had an eye on the broken shards lying around on the asphalt after the spaceship cracked.  Maybe Stone would be a little more discussed or acknowledged if his message wasn\u2019t so insistently political and uncomfortable. Still, the real reason there aren\u2019t a bazillion Sly Stone think-pieces whooshing through the net isn\u2019t because of that. It\u2019s just a marketing failure. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody got the thing I can hear / But if I have to I will yell in your ear,\u201d he sang in one of his 70s tracks, Time for Livin\u2019, but he\u2019s been singularly bad at shouting in anyone\u2019s ear for decades. The media needs a news peg, and when an artist isn\u2019t releasing music, or performing, or maintaining the brand, it\u2019s difficult to generate interest.

If you\u2019re not in the spotlight, nobody looks at you \u2013 until you die, at which point think piece writers are all given one last chance to consider your legacy. \u201cYou only funky as your last cut / You focus on the past your ass\u2019ll be a has-what\u201d, as Sly-and-Prince-disciple Andre 3000 said, back when he was still relevant and people wrote think pieces about him. Time and the media chug ahead, and Stevie Wonder\u2019s career is less important at the moment than whatever Justin Bieber happened to say yesterday on Twitter. That\u2019s pop, and there\u2019s not much point in being bitter about it. Still, it\u2019s worthwhile to take a moment now and then to think about the legends while they\u2019re here, rather than waiting for that arbitrary online instant when everybody all at once will be allowed to remember, after Sly\u2019s left, how important it was for him to have been here all along.",
