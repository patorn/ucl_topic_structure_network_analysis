  "body": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blog. Here\u2019s a roundup of your comments and photos from last week, including Mary Beard on everyday life in ancient Rome, laughing at Thomas Pynchon on a train in Asia and brainstorming great novels set during world war two. elfwyn has finished Mary Beard\u2019s SPQR:   ...in the paperback edition, which is a lot easier for reading in bed. For someone who has never managed to muster much interest in Ancient Rome, apart from Lindsey Davis\u2019s Falco novels, this has been a revelation. It\u2019s full of fascinating detail not only about Roman myth, customs and history, and what Romans thought of themselves and their place in the world, but about the lives of ordinary people. One moment you think, \u201cOh, they\u2019re just like us,\u201d and then you\u2019re brought up short by some amazing and completely unexpected fact that proves emphatically that no, actually, they weren\u2019t like us at all. Highly recommended (and her current TV series, though not based on the book, features many of the same events and locations).      TaymazValley is reading One Thousand and One Nights \u2013 \u2018also known as Arabian Nights, however wrongly because the book has stories covering lands as far away as China, and it does not take place in Arabia.\u2019 Photograph: GuardianWitness    Appears78 just finished \u2013 and \u201cgreatly enjoyed and hugely admired\u201d \u2013 Thomas Pynchon\u2019s Inherent Vice:   Lord, even when he\u2019s trying to appear as though he\u2019s not really trying very hard at all, Pynchon\u2019s a fantastic writer. Loved the intricate, yarn-like complexity of the plot, which was deeply satisfyingly wound-up and honked multiply throughout, including on a crowded train to a lake in the middle of nowhere in Central Asia, to the bemusement of local people. Goodness gracious, he\u2019s a funny man.  SydneyH read Memories of my Melancholy Whores, a \u201cgorgeous\u201d novella by Colombian author Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez:   It doesn\u2019t have the \u201cmagic realism\u201d of One Hundred Years of Solitude, aside from a couple of surreal exceptions (the protagonist\u2019s cat comes with an instruction manual), and the prose is lighter, without the page-long paragraphs. It\u2019s rare to come across a text which is sinister and charming at the same time, and I\u2019ve enjoyed it enough that I\u2019m going to have to read his whole catalogue.  And a great conversation starter \u2013 paulburns reflects after reading Lawrence Durell\u2019s Constance:  What do people think are the great novels set in WW2? I have Vitaly Grossman\u2019s Life and Fate, Anatoli Rybakov\u2019s Dust and Ashes, Norman Mailer\u2019s The Naked and the Dead, Gunter Grass\u2019s The Tin Drum, George Johnston\u2019s My Brother Jack (for an Australian perspective.) Would be interested to hear people\u2019s thoughts, suggestions.  Interesting links about books and reading  The Irish Novel That\u2019s So Good People Were Scared to Translate It: M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain\u2019s d\u00e9but novel, \u201cCr\u00e9 na Cille\u201d (\u201cChurchyard Clay\u201d), has been hailed as the greatest novel to be written in the Irish language. But for almost seventy years, the novel remained untranslated into English. Thanks to paulburns for pointing us towards this New Yorker piece (and good luck to him with Churchyard Clay!) James Baldwin & the Fear of a Nation: \u201cToday, like sixty years ago, much of the public rhetoric about race is devoted to explaining to an incurious white public, in rudimentary terms, the contours of institutional racism.\u201d Writers, scholars, and activists have turned to Baldwin for answers. By Nathaniel Rich writes for the New York Review of Books.     Related: Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter     California Notes: A new Joan Didion. Enough said. Also in the NYRB.  Beyonc\u00e9, Warsan Shire, and the Love Affair Between Music and Poetry: Pitchfork analyse this relationship, from Kanye West to Kate Tempest via, of course, Beyonce.  Writers, the Loneliest Artists of All: \u201cThe irony of loneliness, of course, is it that it\u2019s an isolating experience that many people (and especially writers) are unified by. So why, then, is it so hard to write about?\u201d By Michelle Filgate for Literary Hub.  Why America Is Ready For Novelist Angela Flournoy: after raising Detroit\u2019s ghosts in her critically acclaimed novel, The Turner House, this debut author suddenly has everyone\u2019s attention in the US \u2013 and it should everywhere else, might we add. In Buzzfeed. \u2018I Just Don\u2019t Find American Literature Interesting\u2019: Lit-Blog Pioneer Jessa Crispin Closes Bookslut, Does Not Bite Tongue. \u201cThere seems to be less and less underground. And what it\u2019s replaced by is this very professional, shiny, happy plastic version of literature.\u201d In Vulture.  Zadie Smith On The Met Gala And Her New Novel, in which she says her forthcoming novel Swing Time will include: \u201cTap dancing, black women, money, poverty, sadness and joy!\u201d In Refinery29.
