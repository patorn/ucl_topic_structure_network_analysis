  "body": "Some Sunderland supporters are already planning post-match parties on Wednesday night but Sam Allardyce has cautioned that his players may not find beating Everton quite as straightforward as advertised. Victory against Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s faltering yet still gifted side at the Stadium of Light would relegate Newcastle United and Norwich City while sealing the Wearside club\u2019s Premier League safety. To Allardyce the fixture spells stress as well as opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s still big, big pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two games left to secure Premier League status but knowing we can kill everyone else off on Wednesday is pressure in itself. Can we handle it?\u201d   Related: Sam Allardyce urges England to consider Jermain Defoe for Euro 2016    Yet even if his team drop points against Everton, they still have the trip on Sunday to Watford. Moreover their superior goal difference dictates that, in order to retain any hope of capitalising on another Wearside stumble at Vicarage Road, Newcastle would have to beat Tottenham at St James\u2019 Park on the same day. Norwich\u2019s even more slender hopes rest on winning their final two games of the campaign and their two rivals stalling. With safety almost painfully close, Sunderland\u2019s manager dreads both complacency and nerves. \u201cEverton will be out to spoil our celebrations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a big performance. Roberto\u2019s players will fight all the way because of the criticism they received after their defeat at Leicester at the weekend. We\u2019ll need to really be on our top game to beat an Everton side that\u2019s performed better away than at home this season.\u201d Winning would spare Allardyce the torture of an agonising afternoon at Watford. \u201cThe relegation battle could still go down to the final day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it would be a great relief for me if my players can beat Everton and finish it. If you need points on the last day of the season, things become very unpredictable. With the pressure involved you just don\u2019t know who is going to do what.\u201d If, as expected, Sunderland end up still in the top tier it will be the fourth year in a row they have dallied with the drop only to save themselves at the 11th hour. \u201cLet\u2019s do it for a fourth time and then say: \u2018Let\u2019s not let it happen again,\u2019\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cUs being part of the Premier League is massively important for the city of Sunderland. I think there\u2019s growing support for this team \u2013 it\u2019s the biggest thing in and around the city and we\u2019re getting sell-out crowds even though we\u2019re near the bottom. If we can survive, and then get better and more exciting players in and try to achieve something, that support will keep growing.\u201d Sunderland\u2019s impressive fan-base \u2013 crowds this season have averaged well over 40,000 at the 50,000-capacity Stadium of Light \u2013 not only highlights the club\u2019s potential, but also helped defeat Chelsea last Saturday. \u201cThe atmosphere here plays a big part,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cIt makes the hair on the back of the players\u2019 necks stand up. Against Chelsea they got cheered for every tackle, every interception, every good pass, shot or cross. There\u2019s still anxiety in the dressing room, knots in the stomach, real anxiety, but the atmosphere makes you play well. It\u2019s these atmospheres you miss most when you finish playing. These are the experiences you don\u2019t forget.\u201d Mart\u00ednez is in real peril of losing his job at Goodison Park and Allardyce feels dismayed. \u201cA manager should be allowed a disappointing season,\u201d he said. \u201cRoberto should be allowed time to overcome it. He should be defined not by this season but by what he\u2019s done during his career \u2013 and for Everton since joining them. \u201cWe all sometimes don\u2019t quite get the results we want. It happens to experienced managers. And Roberto is experienced enough to learn from this and to take Everton forward to better things, to greater heights. There seems to be talk about them needing a new manager who is better at spending money than he is. It\u2019s ridiculous. Why is Roberto suddenly not good enough to spend the money?\u201d Like Mart\u00ednez, Allardyce has done his fair share of fretting lately. \u201cThe players do worry but they don\u2019t worry as much as you do as a manager,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a player I worried about myself more than anything else but as a manager, staying up is your responsibility and you worry about the whole football club. Survival is far more important for the club than my CV showing I\u2019ve never been relegated from the Premier League. It would be a big relief for me \u2013 and it would mean the players can go and celebrate.\u201d He will have no problem if the alcohol starts flowing after 10pm on Wednesday night. \u201cWill I let them go on the pop,\u201d he queried? \u201cWhy not \u2013 I\u2019ll join them.\u201d",
