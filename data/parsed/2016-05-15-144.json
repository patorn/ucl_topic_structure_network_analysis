  "body": "The Queen and the prime minister both suffered diplomatic embarrassments last week. They were caught on camera speaking their minds. David Cameron, while talking to the Queen, referred to the \u201cfantastically corrupt countries\u201d whose leaders were attending his anti-corruption summit. Then, later that day, while talking to a senior police officer, the Queen called the Chinese delegation from last year\u2019s state visit \u201cvery rude\u201d.           Cameron caught boasting to Queen about \u2018fantastically corrupt\u2019 countries    Embarrassment is a strange emotion. You can never be quite sure when it\u2019ll strike. There are some things you\u2019d predict would be embarrassing: farting audibly, discovering your flies have been undone all day, being woken by an usher because you were snoring during a play. But then there are other, less obvious moments: feeling strangely observed while helping yourself at a buffet, running hard to catch a train and missing it, being suddenly noticed by the person you\u2019ve been strangely observing help themselves at a buffet. Being observed is crucial \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to feel embarrassed in utter solitude \u2013 but there\u2019s more to it than that. Otherwise this newspaper\u2019s title would be a mission statement to embarrass the whole world; not so much speaking truth to power as waiting until power\u2019s trousers fall down and then laughing.    If someone says to you 'That\u2019s a bit embarrassing', it immediately is, even if it wasn\u2019t. The chain reaction has begun    The timing of the sensation of being observed is the vital factor. If you\u2019re in control of the timing, everything is much less embarrassing. Hence the difference between striding naked into a crowded room, and a curtain unexpectedly falling away to reveal you naked to a crowded room. I\u2019m pretty sure the latter experience is more embarrassing than the former, though I\u2019ve no intention of conducting an experiment to prove it. Embarrassment can spread, like fire. It\u2019s a chain reaction. People have two main responses to someone else\u2019s embarrassment: to find it funny or to be embarrassed for them. Either outcome increases the embarrassment of the first person: it\u2019s embarrassing to be laughed at, and it\u2019s extremely embarrassing to feel that other people are embarrassed that you\u2019re embarrassed. In the usher-and-snorer-in-the-theatre scenario, the usher will, unless he\u2019s a sociopath, probably be as embarrassed as the snorer \u2013 and a third-party observer might be embarrassed for them both. This spreading stain of mortification is odd as, in this situation, it\u2019s only the snorer who\u2019s done anything at all wrong (unless we count the director and playwright). One of the most intensely embarrassing moments of my life came a few months ago when I accidentally sent an email to my long-time comedy partner, Robert Webb, which was blank apart from the subject line, which read: \u201cRING ROB RE LIFT AND SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\u201d I meant to send it to myself because I use my inbox as a sort of \u201cThings to do\u201d list. (I could probably use \u201cNotes\u201d or \u201cCalendar alerts\u201d or \u201cReminders\u201d, and I swear I\u2019ll get to grips with all that just as soon as I receive confirmation that I\u2019m immortal.) In this case, the things I wanted to make myself do were to ask Rob for a lift to a mutual friend\u2019s stag do the following weekend, and to wish him happy birthday for the week before. But I wouldn\u2019t have chosen to do it that way round. I\u2019d intended to telephone, full of apologies for forgetting his birthday, and then slip in the all-important lift request like an afterthought. It was exactly as my phone made its swish of email-sending irrevocability that I realised some bloody temp of a synapse in my brain\u2019s admin cortex had caused me to send the message to Rob for the totally inadequate reason that it was about him.     Illustration by David Foldvari.    I don\u2019t know why it was such a cringe-inducing moment. I wasn\u2019t particularly ashamed of it: not of sending myself email reminders, nor forgetting Rob\u2019s birthday (I often have before, as he has mine), nor wanting to ask for a lift. I am happy to admit to being a birthday-forgetting lift-scrounger who can\u2019t set up calendar alerts. I suppose the catalyst for my embarrassment was the amusement I knew Rob would feel at the embarrassment he\u2019d know I would. The unintended observers\u2019 expectation of discomfiture is also crucial in the cases of the Queen and the prime minister \u2013 because neither of them has said anything remotely weird, wrong or, in terms of its actual meaning, controversial. The countries that David Cameron called corrupt, Nigeria and Afghanistan, absolutely are corrupt. When Transparency International recently listed the world\u2019s countries in order of governmental probity they featured at 136 and 166 respectively. So the prime minister said something accurate. Why\u2019s that embarrassing? Because those countries\u2019 leaders got to hear it? Well, they\u2019re already coming to an anti-corruption conference, so I imagine the subject was inevitably going to be raised and their attendance implies they might even be amenable to addressing it. Because Cameron\u2019s government indiscriminately sloshes aid those countries\u2019 way and doesn\u2019t lift a finger to make the City of London a less effective haven for the world\u2019s ill-gotten gold? Well, if it\u2019s that, it\u2019s not his one factually correct remark we should focus on, but his whole lamentable regime. And, as for the Queen\u2019s comment, what on earth is she expected to say? President Xi\u2019s delegation was clearly a nightmare. Would it have been better if she\u2019d called them polite? \u201cWhen will we British learn to treat foreign potentates with respect? All they want is to carry guns and have a bunch of protesters thrown in jail \u2013 what\u2019s the problem?\u201d She merely expressed the view that any decent person would hold.           \u2018Very rude\u2019: Queen\u2019s unguarded comments on Chinese officials during UK visit    It\u2019s only embarrassing because the media say it is. And if someone says to you \u201cThat\u2019s a bit embarrassing\u201d, it immediately is, even if it previously wasn\u2019t. The chain reaction has begun. A faux pas has occurred. The fact that it consisted solely of the expression of self-evident truths doesn\u2019t matter. This is a consequence of our culture\u2019s increasing comfort with placing limits on freedom of speech, and with the notion that some things simply must not be said \u2013 opinions or, in this case, facts. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re reinventing the proprieties of the Victorian age, when no one would refer to sex or the lavatory, when outward bland placidity concealed a ferment of hypocrisy. We could easily suffer such repression again if we come to accept a climate in which both our head of state and leader of government are made to feel embarrassed when footage emerges of them disdaining to lie.",
