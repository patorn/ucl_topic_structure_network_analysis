  "body": "Hundreds of world leaders and politicians will descend on Istanbul on Monday in a nominal attempt to reform the global humanitarian system, despite criticism that their summit is a photo-opportunity that will achieve little.  Representatives of 175 countries, including 57 heads of states or governments, will attend the world humanitarian summit, as the outgoing UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, attempts to restructure the way the world responds to humanitarian crises.    Related: Everything you need to know about the world humanitarian summit    Angela Merkel is the highest-profile western leader due to attend, while Britain will be represented by development secretary Justine Greening. About 6,000 senior aid workers will also participate in debates and panels at the two-day event. With more people \u2013 about 125 million \u2013 in need of humanitarian assistance than ever, aid groups increasingly under-resourced, and international law under growing threat, Ban wants the international community to agree to new global humanitarian standards.  The key commitments to which he hopes leaders will agree include better structuring of aid; more funding for local groups; greater respect for the rules of war; better planning for disaster situations and climate change; and wider sharing of refugee populations.  Hailing the prospects of the summit, Herve Verhoosel, the summit\u2019s spokesman, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in 70 years of UN history that a summit has been organised to talk about humanitarian issues. Today we\u2019re living in the worst humanitarian situation since world war two \u2013 we have 125 million people in need of humanitarian support in the world. Can we cope with that situation working the same way we do today, or do we need to change it? That\u2019s why the secretary general has called this conference.\u201d  There is nevertheless mounting criticism of the summit from aid and rights workers, with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res calling it a \u201cfig-leaf\u201d for international failures, and Oxfam describing it as an \u201cexpensive talking shop\u201d. A columnist in Foreign Policy, an American magazine, wondered if it \u201ccould do more harm than good\u201d. MSF has even pulled out of the conference, saying it no longer believes that the assembled leaders have any genuine desire to make binding commitments. Speaking to the Guardian, MSF\u2019s UK director, Vickie Hawkins, said it was unlikely that the same countries who are currently shirking their obligations to refugees would turn over a new leaf next week.

There\u2019s a lot of good intentions, but also empty rhetoric. And we felt we needed more than that, given the current disregard for international law.\u201d Hawkins also warned that the summit\u2019s goals had become too grand, and also too political for independent aid groups like hers to agree to. \u201cFor us, the word \u2018humanitarian\u2019 has dropped out of the humanitarian summit,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cIt has become a summit about a much broader and longer-term political agenda, rather than being about core humanitarian assistance.\u201d Oxfam GB\u2019s chief executive, Mark Goldring, said: \u201cThis summit needs to be more than an expensive talking shop by tackling the repeated failure of governments to resolve conflicts and end the culture of impunity in which civilians are killed without consequence. Goldring added: \u201cRich nations cannot wash their hands of the suffering for which they are partly responsible and [must] do more to take in their fair share of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. Recent moves such as the EU-Turkey deal and the plans to outsource EU border controls to African countries with dubious human rights records set a dangerous precedent, horse trading the rights of refugees in order to keep them from our doorstep and shirking responsibility for their welfare.  \u201cLast week, the Kenyan government pointed to the example of European countries turning away Syrian refugees when it announced the closure of the Dadaab refugee camp.\u201d Verhoosel said he was disappointed by the criticism, arguing that the UN and its members had to start somewhere, and that this week\u2019s gathering could be that starting point. \u201cWe need to try to do what we can during the summit,\u201d said Verhoosel, questioning how critics could pre-empt the outcome of an event that has not yet happened. \u201cMaybe they have a crystal ball?\u201d",
