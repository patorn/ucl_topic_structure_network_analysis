  "body": "The former Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott has attacked the buy-up of almost two-thirds of the UK\u2019s tallest residential building by foreign investors as deplorable. Lord Prescott was joined by a senior Conservative, London\u2019s mayoral leadership and Labour\u2019s front bench in voicing serious concerns about the Tower, after the Guardian revealed that the 50-storey block of 214 luxury apartments by the river Thames at Vauxhall was more than 60% owned by foreign buyers.    Related: 'Tower for the toffs': UK's tallest skyscraper and playground of the rich    Owners of properties in the high rise include a billionaire Russian oligarch, the chairman of a defunct Nigerian bank and a Kyrgyz vodka tycoon. A quarter of the flats are held by companies in secretive offshore tax havens and several owners said their neighbours spent little time in their homes, which sold for \u00a32.2m on average. The revelations about the Tower are likely to be seized on by campaigners and politicians as the starkest example yet of the housing crisis gripping the capital, in which new homes are sold abroad as investments and left largely empty while fewer and fewer young people can afford to buy or rent in the city. The shadow housing minister, John Healey, said the building had become \u201ca symbol of the housing crisis\u201d that \u201cfuels people\u2019s anger and sense of injustice\u201d. Conservative MP Bob Blackman, who sits on the House of Commons communities select committee that scrutinises housing policy, said the ownership of the five-storey penthouse by an oligarch who had not yet lived there was ridiculous. Blackman said it might now be time to consider a policy demanding buyers of UK properties commit to living in the UK for more than 90 days a year. At London\u2019s City Hall, the mayor, Sadiq Khan\u2019s new housing chief, deputy mayor James Murray, said the Tower was \u201canother example of where the previous mayor failed to get to grips with London\u2019s housing crisis, adding: \u201cSadiq Khan was elected on a mandate that Londoners should have \u2018first dibs\u2019 on more of the homes built in the capital.\u201d   Related: The Guardian view on housing in London: bricks and mortals | Editorial    Prescott controversially granted building consent in 2005 against the wishes of the local council and the planning inspector. This week, his decision was attacked as \u201can appalling mistake\u201d by the former Tory cabinet minister Lord Baker, who predicted in 2005: \u201cIn that great tower, there will be no social affordable housing. It is all for the alphas. It is all for the toffs.\u201d  Prescott said: \u201cI was hoping that we were providing housing for housing. We didn\u2019t envisage that it would be given over to people investing in London. I had no power to stop it on the grounds of who was going to occupy it.\u201d Ken Livingstone, who also backed the scheme when he was mayor of London, said he had no idea so many foreign buyers would be seeking to deposit money in London property. He described the international buy-up as appalling. \u201cI was very keen to get foreign investment into London, but that was in terms of constructing developments and creating new jobs, not flogging them off to people who just keep them there in case there is a coup and they have to flee,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was mayor now, I would put compulsory purchase orders on empty homes. Either you live in it or sell it. The more empty properties there are, the more it hypes up the overall house price level.\u201d But representatives of the property industry defended the scheme and insisted there was a vital need for international investment. \u201cUpfront foreign investment is key to bringing forward a lot of these developments,\u201d said Steve Turner, spokesman for the Home Builders Federation. \u201cTheir investment ultimately leads to an increase in overall housing supply, including affordable homes. There is affordable housing in this development, but it is just in this particular tower that there isn\u2019t. The foreign funding for this tower will directly lead to the developer\u2019s ability to provide affordable housing.\u201d A spokesman for the developer, St George, said it was wrong to focus only on the makeup of the Tower\u2019s ownership. \u201cSt George has a wide range of homes under construction in London, in nine developments providing 9,300 homes, with 2,403 of these being affordable to buy or rent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole of the St George Wharf site was developed at considerable risk and after it lay empty for decades. St George committed to construction of the Tower in the recession, after the banking crash, when other sites across London were being mothballed. The Tower was an important signpost to the development of Nine Elms from Vauxhall, with the wider Nine Elms development due to create 25,000 permanent jobs over the next 10 years.\u201d   Ghost tower",
