  "body": "Pink Panther star Burt Kwouk, best known for playing Inspector Clouseau\u2019s manservant Cato opposite Peter Sellers, has died aged 85. A statement from the Warrington-born actor\u2019s agent to the BBC revealed the news. No further details were given as to cause of death.  \u201cBeloved actor Burt Kwouk has sadly passed peacefully away May 24,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe family will be having a private funeral but there will be a memorial at a later date.\u201d            Kwouk shot to worldwide fame as Cato, known for his trademark unexpected attacks on Clouseau. These were designed to keep the incompetent police detective on his toes at all times, but usually resulted in the wrecking of the Frenchman\u2019s flat. Kwouk played Cato in seven Pink Panther films between 1964 and 1993. His final appearance was in the 1993 non-Sellers effort Son of the Pink Panther, starring Roberto Benigni as Clouseau\u2019s illegitimate son. Kwouk, who despite being born in the UK lived with his Chinese parents in Shanghai until he was 17, also starred in three Bond movies, Goldfinger, You Only Live Twice and the 1967 spoof Casino Royale. He played Entwistle in the BBC\u2019s Last of the Summer Wine between 2002 and 2010 and Major Yamauchi in Pacific theatre second world war drama Tenko in 1981. Kwouk received an OBE for services to drama in 2011.",
