  "body": "As a part-time resident of a small coastal town in East Yorkshire, I was delighted when our newly refurbished Meridian Centre was equipped with a decent-sized cinema and began showing a regular programme of films. These tend to be screened on Monday afternoons and sometimes on Saturday evenings. The Monday sessions are followed by a splendid afternoon tea \u2013 dainty sandwichs, cakes, as much tea and coffee as you can imbibe, all for the sum, film included, of \u00a34. However, audiences are not always large and there are times when the money taken does not even cover the cost of a screening licence, which can be up to \u00a3125 for a one-off event. Those running this worthwhile venture tell me that the cinema might have to close because of high licensing fees. Nor is Withernsea a place where most people can afford to pay, or would pay, \u00a310 a ticket. In Cannes film festival week, we should remember there are many such small cinemas in operation now. Is it really necessary for the distributors to charge so much for what is essentially the loan of a DVD? Surely some discretion could be used in the case of small cinema venues which do provide a valuable service to a community?Susan HarrWithernsea, East Yorkshire",
