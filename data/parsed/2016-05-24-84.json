  "body": "Glyndebourne\u2019s new production of Il Barbiere di Siviglia \u2013 the festival\u2019s first for more than 30 years, is directed by Annabel Arden \u2013 whose approach to Rossini\u2019s comedy is tinged with the surreal. The opera is by an Italian composer and based on the work of a French dramatist, but for Arden the Spanish setting is paramount. Her staging, as she puts it in a programme note, is \u201cabout taking inspiration from the Spanish tradition of the grotesque and the marvellous and making a synthesis of it.\u201d The end result is nicely stylised, but of variable impact. The walls of Bartolo\u2019s house are covered with Moorish-influenced blue and white tiles, and dominated by the image of a bird about to take flight, a fitting image for Danielle de Niese\u2019s firebrand Rosina, who is bent on escape. Costumes suggest the 1950s: de Niese\u2019s frocks are modelled on Balenciaga, while Taylor Stayton\u2019s Almaviva wears a silver leather coat and sports an Elvis-style quiff.     Berta (Janis Kelly), Count Almaviva (Taylor Stayton), Rosina (Danielle de Niese), Figaro (Bj\u00f6rn B\u00fcrger) and Basilio (Christophoros Stamboglis). Photograph: Bill Cooper    There are occasional nods in the direction of Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel. During Basilio\u2019s calumny aria, smoke billows like brimstone from beneath Christophoros Stamboglis\u2019s cassock as he sings. One of the opera\u2019s running jokes is that Figaro, the self-made man conspiring with an aristocrat to outwit the bourgeoisie, can get everywhere. Arden takes this quite literally, as Bj\u00f6rn B\u00fcrger\u2019s lanky, charismatic barber emerges from walls, trapdoors, and even the orchestra pit, at one point seemingly materialising out of nowhere atop Bartolo\u2019s enormous filing cabinet.    De Niese, a soprano singing a mezzo role, is not always ideal, despite her fiery theatricality       Rosina (Danielle de Niese) and Figaro (Bj\u00f6rn B\u00fcrger). Photograph: Bill Cooper    Unfortunately, it takes ages to get going, and the first half is not as funny as it could be. A trio of actors in various guises \u2013 Almaviva\u2019s sidekicks, Bartolo\u2019s servants \u2013 weave their way through round the stage, sometimes effectively, often distractingly. Alessandro Corbelli\u2019s Bartolo is seemingly obsessed with collecting pianos, and there are moments when all the cast can do is stand and deliver, as the actors haul the instruments around as they take over the stage like something from one of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco\u2019s absurdist plays. The second half is much more focused, and a lot funnier as Stayton, in his priestly garb, homes in on de Niese, and the actors provide toy boy distractions for Janis Kelly\u2019s scene-stealing Berta, who sports natty lingerie beneath her tweed twinset. It sounds impressive, though De Niese, a soprano singing a mezzo role, is not always ideal, despite her fiery theatricality. But the combination of ensemble precision and focused individual performances, so crucial to Rossinian comedy, is beautifully judged elsewhere. Stayton\u2019s coloratura is effortlessly beguiling, while Stamboglis, a brief moment of imprecision apart, makes a suavely unctuous Basilio. Corbelli\u2019s Bartolo is an object lesson in comic understatement. B\u00fcrger rightly dominates with singing of great bravado and warmth: Arden should do something with his over-extravagant hand gestures, but this is a performance of considerable distinction.  Enrique Mazzola\u2019s conducting is spot on in its combination of energy and exactitude and the London Philharmonic plays with admirable spirit and finesse.  In rep at Glyndebourne, Lewes, until 17 July. Box office: 01273 813813.",
