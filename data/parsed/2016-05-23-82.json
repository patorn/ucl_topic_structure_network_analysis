  "body": "The first glimpse of Disney\u2019s Beauty and the Beast reboot featuring Emma Watson has kept things pretty cryptic: there\u2019s a spot of ancestor worship (via the Be Our Guest tagline, referencing the famous song from the 1990 cartoon), a couple of lines of dialogue (presumably from Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen as Lumiere and Cogsworth), plus two hints of Watson herself: a nervous \u201cHello\u201d and an out-of-focus shot of her leaning over a rose. The trailer has instead very much majored on the production design, with extended scenes of (what we can safely assume) is the Beast\u2019s deserted mansion as Belle/Beauty tentatively opens the Beast-shaped door. In its lush, candles-and-chandeliers art direction, it very much recalls last year\u2019s Cinderella; rather interestingly, though, the snatch of McGregor/McKellen dialogue \u2013 \u201cWhat if she is the one?\u201d \u2013 suggests that the film is going to exploit the same prophecy-fulfilment structure that has fuelled the two Alice in Wonderland films, and is a key part of the way Disney has re-engineered its films aimed at early-teen girls, in the service of a new mission of empowerment.     The one ... Mia Wasikowska in Alice Through the Looking Glass Photograph: Allstar/DISNEY    It can\u2019t have gone without notice that \u2013 at least since Brave \u2013 Disney has gone full throttle to eradicate the sappy princess/fairy from its films, and instead substitute sturdy, self-reliant role models who may be subject to emotional trauma, but aren\u2019t subdued by it. In Brave, Frozen, Maleficent, male agency is mostly sidelined and/or removed, and mother-daughter or sister-sister relationships are key. Alice Through the Looking Glass, which follows on from the Tim Burton\u2019s 2010 Alice in Wonderland, is a case in point: the film opens with a 19-year-old Alice commanding her merchant ship as it battles pirates during a raging tempest. This is someone who can do without romance, as well as overcome the Victorian male prerogative with relative ease. As in the first film, Alice\u2019s entry to \u201cUnderland\u201d is configured in terms of answering the call of an oracle \u2013 like Belle, being \u201cthe one\u201d who can lift the curse on the land. It\u2019s a long way from Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice, which heralded the terrors and complexities of adulthood for its pre-teen protagonist.  Whether this applies to Beauty and the Beast remains to be seen; but the participation of Watson \u2013 UN Goodwill Ambassador and confident feminist \u2013 means that the film\u2019s messages about empowerment will be examined closely. Let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t fall short.",
