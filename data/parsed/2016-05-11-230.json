  "body": "It\u2019s fun to spend an imaginary million or two. Damian Lewis\u2019s first purchase would be a private jet. \u201cThat would be the first thing I\u2019d buy, undoubtedly,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving been on a private jet only two or three times, it\u2019s one of life\u2019s great luxuries. I would do that. Then I might buy Liverpool football club.\u201d This discussion has come about because in his latest TV drama, Billions, the actor plays Bobby Axelrod, a US hedge-fund gazillionaire with blue-collar roots, a passion for Pearl Jam and a fine line in cashmere hoodies. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a new class of young billionaire,\u201d says writer David Levien. \u201cThey\u2019re 40, self-made, and casual in a way you don\u2019t see depicted in the media. These are guys who call their own shots, fly around in their own planes and seem to have the world at their feet.\u201d The show sets Axelrod on a collision course with US attorney Chuck Rhoades, played by Paul Giamatti. Rhoades is convinced Axelrod is using illegal insider trading and vows to bring him down. Over 10 episodes, the two titans \u2013 one in the public sector, one in the private \u2013 go at it like Foreman and Ali. But Billions is more nuanced than just a slugging match. Lewis\u2019s Axelrod \u2013 like most of his characters \u2013 is smoothly inscrutable. He genuinely seems to be a family man, grounded in a working-class background (to the extent that you can be while buying $84m mansions in the Hamptons).     Like Foreman v Ali \u2026 Axelrod slugs it out with US attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti). Photograph: SHOWTIME    \u201cIt\u2019s as much a study of people as of kings and kingdoms,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cA study of what personality types tend to win these positions in our society \u2013 and what they\u2019re prepared to do to keep themselves there.\u201d  Lewis met with several \u201chedgies\u201d to prepare for the role, to \u201cexamine them\u201d and try and see if he could find any common ground. \u201cI think they\u2019re misunderstood,\u201d he says. \u201cI think very few people still understand the distinction between CEOs on Wall Street and the hedge-fund billionaires operating separately.\u201d But his main reason was to try and hear an \u201cintellectual defence of what they do, given that they know what they do is disliked\u201d.   The defence he got, he says, was that hedge-fund managers are market regulators. \u201cThey go round and single out overvalued, underperforming companies. Yes, of course they hope to make some money on the bet that this company is going to fail. And yes, there has been adverse press suggesting they then manipulate markets and press, to convince shareholders to withdraw their money to drop the share price, so they can then make their money. All of that might be true, but if it\u2019s clean and people are behaving honourably and honestly, then that is also a compelling argument. That they are there to, if you like, crusade on behalf of the shareholders.\u201d Hedgies as white knights? Surely he doesn\u2019t truly buy that? \u201cIf you believe \u2013 which I do \u2013 that acting is a bit like advocacy for your character, then of course I want to find the positive points. But I\u2019m realistic enough to know that it\u2019s a broad church, the world of hedge funds, and I think some people are more honourable than others.\u201d     Damian Lewis as Nicholas Brody in Homeland. Photograph: Showtime/Everett/Rex Feature    Bobby Axelrod\u2019s honour is open to question in Billions. It\u2019s typical of the new breed of premium cable shows in that it centres on an antihero \u2013 a Tony Soprano or Walter White \u2013 who you can\u2019t help but root for. At different times, Axe could be classed a hoodlum, a crook or a saint \u2013 he pays for the college education of all the children of his former colleagues killed in 9/11. Meanwhile, his nemesis, Rhoades, comes from waspish old money and is partial to a bit of extreme S&M with his wife Wendy (Maggie Siff), who works for Axelrod as an on-site shrink.  There are no moral black and whites here, but then as Lewis points out, megalomania and megabucks do strange things to morality. \u201cBobby might have convinced himself of the truth of everything he does \u2013 perhaps in the same way Tony Blair convinced himself of the \u2018truth\u2019. It\u2019s difficult to say that Blair was consciously mendacious: I just think he drank some Kool Aid and managed to create a moral and intellectual argument to justify anything he did. That\u2019s what powerful people do; it\u2019s what delusional people do.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been long since we last heard Lewis\u2019s impeccable American accent. For three seasons (four if you include flashbacks) of Homeland, he played Nicholas Brody, the marine who was, or possibly wasn\u2019t, \u201cturned\u201d on a tour in Iraq. \u201cIt was interesting: a more liberal viewer enjoyed and supported Brody in Homeland and a more conservative viewer thought he was an outright terrorist and was to be condemned. So, it sort of depends on the personal politics of the viewer.\u201d           Damian Lewis as Antony in Julius Caesar: \u2018Friends, Romans, countrymen\u2019    Lewis has two children and lives in London, so returning to New York for another potentially long-running series was not a decision he took lightly. \u201cI get very lonely,\u201d he says. \u201cI get homesick \u2013 or family sick more. When you have two small children and a wife [Helen McCrory] who\u2019s also an actress, and a very successful one, blocking out that much time is daunting. It\u2019s a worry and I\u2019ll let you know if I\u2019m still married at the end of it.\u201d \u201cI can be a bit blase,\u201d he admits. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want to do this, it doesn\u2019t fit in with this, that and the other.\u2019 Then you take stock for a few moments and realise people kill for roles like this.\u201d Billions has already aired in the US, and people in New York now recognise him not as Brody but as Bobby Axelrod. \u201cThey\u2019ll say: \u2018Do you think you\u2019d vote for Trump?\u2019\u201d Lewis gently has to remind fans that he is not Axelrod, before adding, \u201cBut he might vote for Trump.\u201d  Billions is on Sky Atlantic on Thursday at 9pm",
