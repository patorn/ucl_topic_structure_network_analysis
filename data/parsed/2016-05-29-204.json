Each writer has won $5,000 for being shortlisted, and the winner \u2013 judged as being of \u201cthe highest literary merit\u201d and presenting \u201cAustralian life in any of its phases\u201d \u2013 will receive $60,000.

The announcement follows a year of public discussion about the strength of the Victorian capital\u2019s literary scene in comparison to other cities, and the state\u2019s pledge in April of an extra $115m over four years to creative industries. Speaking on behalf of the judging panel, the State Library of New South Wales Mitchell librarian, Richard Neville, said: \u201cThe focus of this year\u2019s shortlist is the creation, maintenance and manipulation of identity: the impact of its dislocation, the devastation of its theft, and the consequences of its reimagination.   \u201cThe 2016 shortlist moves around colonial society, a dysfunctional late 20th century and a disturbing future, all realised with divergent but consistently powerful voices.\u201d  With Neville on the judging panel is the Australian journalist and columnist Murray Waldren, the Sydney-based bookseller Lindy Jones, the writer and editor Craig Munro, and the emeritus professor Susan Sheridan. The final winner will be announced at the Melbourne writers festival on 26 August. The judges\u2019 comments on the shortlist    Related: Literati cities: just the spot for networking, less so for writing a great novel     Hope Farm by Peggy Frew (Scribe Publications): \u201cA quietly powerful and haunting novel, full of the aching intensity of the outcast, rendered in pitch-perfect tone and heartbreakingly believable\u201d Leap by Myfanwy Jones (Allen & Unwin): \u201cA beautiful story about the resolution of grief, not by moving on or forgetting, but by finally accommodating, absorbing and accepting its weight\u201d Black Rock White City by AS Patric (Transit Lounge): \u201cA fresh and powerful exploration of the immigrant experience and Australian life that explores the damages of war, the constraints of choice, the possibility of redemptive love and social isolation amid suburbia\u201d Salt Creek by Lucy Treloar (Pan Macmillian): \u201cThis portrait of frontier life is a timetraveller\u2019s delight as it unsettles assumptions about European \u2018settlement\u2019 and its devastating effects on Aboriginal culture, while graphically charting the unequal 19th-century power relations between men and women\u201d The Natural Way of Things by Charlotte Wood (Allen & Unwin): \u201cA confronting story of misogyny that is both shockingly realist in its details and deeply allegorical in its shape\u201d",
