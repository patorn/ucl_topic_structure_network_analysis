  "body": "Dr Zee, the Israeli chemist credited with kicking off the legal highs market in the UK, is showing off his latest invention. Unlike his other discoveries \u2013 most notably mephedrone, which caused a media panic in 2009 when tabloids ran scare stories about \u201cmiaow miaow\u201d and \u201cplant food\u201d \u2013 this one can\u2019t be snorted or swallowed. Instead, it\u2019s a black plastic box that looks rather like a coffee-maker.  \u201cI think maybe we\u2019ll call it the methspresso machine,\u201d he says, while showcasing it on a new BBC documentary, The Last Days of Legal Highs.  The methspresso is more than just a 10/10 pun. It\u2019s Zee\u2019s attempt to get around the British government\u2019s impending Psychoactive Substances bill, which is due to kick in on 26 May. That bill will outlaw not just individual chemical compounds (which cunning chemists including Zee have been circumnavigating with simple tweaks to a substance\u2019s molecular structure), but any substance at all \u201cproducing a psychoactive effect in a person who consumes it\u201d.  If anyone knows how to get around drug laws, it\u2019s Zee. Over the past few years, while the UK government struggled to clamp down on the new chemical compounds flooding the market, Zee was creating new ones on a weekly basis \u2013 a rate far faster than the government could legislate for.      Legal highs, from Magic Crystals to Cotton Candy Carnage. Photograph: Christian Cargill/BBC/Pulse Films    \u201cMy primary motivation is to help people have a good time without breaking the law,\u201d says Zee when we talk. He says he makes a \u201cdecent living\u201d from legal highs, but no more than he would have made in his previous job as a scientist and researcher in the pharmaceuticals industry. \u201cMy drive comes from the will to create something new, better, legal and safe. The underlying belief of this activity is cognitive liberty. I believe people should be allowed to alter their own state of consciousness and self-medicate, as long as it does not harm others or themselves.\u201d Zee is a strange interviewee. \u201cHow long have we got?\u201d he asks when we first speak on the phone, before embarking on a rather tangential monologue about the media and medical professions. Before I\u2019ve managed to get a proper question in, he tells me he\u2019s got a meeting with his accountant he forgot about and that, actually, we\u2019ll have to reschedule. Later, he stresses that concocting new drugs is a discovery process not an inventive one: \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as intentional as most people think. The only aspects of a novel molecule I can control are its chemical structure and its legality. But there is no scientific method for predicting what effect it will have on the human body or mind or brain, and whether it will have any effect at all.\u201d  Zee tests every new concoction on himself. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my working routine \u2013 not part of my private life,\u201d he says. \u201cI make molecule after molecule then try them without prejudice. You have to keep an open mind.\u201d He claims to try one or two new compounds a week. Isn\u2019t it dangerous, putting himself forward as a human guinea pig?     \u2018It\u2019s a lot less dangerous than it seems\u2019 \u2026 Dr Zee working on new chemical compounds. Photograph: BBC    \u201cIt\u2019s a lot less dangerous than it seems,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, I have a great deal of knowledge that allows me to disqualify potential dangers. I strongly discourage blind self-experimentation without a very deep scientific background. DO NOT try this at home!\u201d  Given that Zee is clearly a capable scientist \u2013 he claims to have three degrees in mathematics and previous experience working on the Human Genome Project in Tel Aviv \u2013 isn\u2019t there something more beneficial he could do with his skills? He believes his work has positive effects outside of helping people get high: \u201cA number of substances I have discovered are being investigated for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s, post-traumatic stress disorder and smoking cessation,\u201d he says. \u201cA rather exciting molecule I recently stumbled on feels, in small doses, like alcohol. I have done the necessary toxicological studies and shown it to be much less harmful than alcohol. I am working diligently to develop this compound as a cure for alcoholism and overconsumption.\u201d So is Zee a force for good, a freedom fighter mocking our draconian and self-defeating drug laws? Or is he a brainier version of your average drug dealer, feeding off the misery and despair of addicts?      \u2018A strange workplace\u2019 \u2026 Dr Zee in his lab in Amsterdam. Photograph: BBC    In the documentary, we see head shop owners readying chemicals in cement mixers \u2013 a heavily regulated industry this is not, and the long-term effects on users are still largely unknown. As for the short-term ones: deaths from legal highs have doubled in the last five years, with hospital admissions rising by 56% over the 2009-2012 period. Last week, five men in Rochdale collapsed after taking legal highs called Annihilation and Cherry Bomb.  Documentary director Tom Costello says he met Dr Zee in his laboratory on an industrial estate in Amsterdam \u2013 \u201ca strange workplace: there are bags of white powders on every desk and in every drawer, boards full of strange chemical symbols, and a Breaking Bad-style lab set up where the drugs are cooked up into trays of huge crystals.\u201d He was convinced by Zee\u2019s claims that he wanted to make drug-taking safer and take the trade out of criminals\u2019 hands. \u201cBut however convincing I found his arguments, I was surprised by how little he knew about how his drugs were being sold and taken in Britain,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s used the UK as a petri-dish for an experiment which has had real consequences \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 on the streets of the UK.\u201d I ask Zee how he feels about people being harmed by taking his drugs? His response is well-formed, with something of a politician\u2019s detachment. \u201cI am saddened by stories of people caught in addictive loops and by stories of people that have incurred any sort of harm from any drug,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cI adhere to my commitment to toxicologically test anything I promote for market, and have data attesting to the safety of my discoveries. Also, keep in mind that tolerance does not occur for substances I have promoted. That said, I\u2019d like to find a way for everyone in society, and society itself, to have a beneficial relationship with psychoactives.\u201d     Peter, who runs the Gypsy Kings head shop. Photograph: Christian Cargill/BBC/Pulse Films    Watching the documentary, you do wonder if Zee \u2013 who has \u201cnever met anybody addicted to my drugs. I\u2019ve never come face to face with it\u201d \u2013 is too far removed from his consumers. Whether it\u2019s weed substitute Spice or cocaine-mimicking Rush, users repeatedly stress that the highs are far greater than the thing they\u2019re supposed to ape. The longterm effects can be equally grim too \u2013 we see Glen, 31, whose life has revolved around Spice since he moved on from weed, or Phil, a homeless addict since his teens who ditched illegal drugs for the pleasures of shooting up \u00a340 worth of Magic Crystals in a nearby church every day. These people are clearly trapped in a cycle of addiction \u2013 though you could easily argue that they would be regardless of their chosen substance\u2019s easy availability.  In the documentary, drugs minister Karen Bradley say: \u201cIt\u2019s causing anti-social behaviour, it\u2019s causing harm to young people and communities want to see these head shops close down.\u201d     Phil, who ditched illegal drugs in favour of Magic Crystals. Photograph: Christian Cargill/BBC/Pulse Film    Yet there are counter-arguments. The legal highs business is an \u00a382m industry in the UK, with all the resultant tax income and job creation that brings \u2013 closing that down won\u2019t stop people taking drugs, but it will send a lot of users back to the illegal market.  Zee tells me that \u201csimilar to the way gay rights or freedom of religion are things our societies were opposed to in the past and are proud of upholding today, so we will be proud of upholding cognitive liberty tomorrow\u201d. For all this moral talk, you suspect part of him does get a kick out of finding ways to annoy the establishment, who he says place him under \u201cclose scrutiny\u201d despite his transparent \u2013 and legal \u2013 working methods. Which brings us back to the methspresso machine, Zee\u2019s latest attempt to make recreational drugs within the boundaries of UK law. Using his invention, Zee hopes to sell non-psychoactive substances that people can convert into a psychoactive substance at home (the re-purposed coffee maker will heat the substance in hydrochloric acid for six hours, before converting the resultant brown liquid into powder form \u2013 instead of a coffee dripping out, you get drugs). \u201cI have solved all the major hurdles and have proven feasibility,\u201d he says, when I ask where the project is currently at. \u201cNow, I must work through a sea of tiny details.\u201d As if it needed saying, he adds: \u201cBut I persevere.\u201d  \u2022 The Last Days of Legal Highs is on BBC Three on Wednesday from 6pm.",
