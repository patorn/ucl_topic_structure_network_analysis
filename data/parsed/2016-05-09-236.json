  "body": "Andrew Bailey, the incoming head of the Financial Conduct Authority, said improving the culture of City firms is a priority and that \u201chubris\u201d needs to be added to the list of risks firms face. Giving his last speech as a deputy governor of the Bank of England before taking up his role at the FCA, Bailey pointed to the over-confidence of the management at major banks as a cause for the taxpayer bailouts and billion of pounds in fines for misconduct in recent years. \u201cWe talk often about credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, conduct risk in its several forms. You can add to that, hubris risk, the risk of blinding over-confidence ... It is a risk that can be magnified by broader social attitudes,\u201d Bailey told delegates at the City Week conference on Monday. Even so, he said the City was not being given enough credit for changes in behaviour since the financial crisis. \u201cTen years ago there was considerable reverence towards, and little questioning of, the ability of banks and bankers to make money or of whether boards demonstrated a sufficient diversity of view and outlook to sustain challenge. How things have changed,\u201d he added. Bailey, who as deputy governor of the Bank is also head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, is joining the FCA in July after George Osborne pushed out Martin Wheatley in a move that was regarded as a softening in the government\u2019s stance toward banks. Wheatley\u2019s temporary replacement Tracey McDermott was criticised in December for dropping a review into banking culture. The current head of the PRA said that the culture and people in banks mattered \u201ca great deal\u201d to financial regulators. \u201cCulture has a major influence on the outcomes that matter to us as regulators. My assessment of recent history is that there has not been a case of a major prudential or conduct failing in a firm which did not have among its root causes a failure of culture as manifested in governance, remuneration, risk management or tone from the top,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cCulture has thus laid the ground for bad outcomes, for instance where management are so convinced of their rightness that they hurtle for the cliff without questioning the direction of travel.\u201d He said that the public perception of banking, and some other areas of finance, was that the industry was still focused too much on \u201cgreed is good\u201d. \u201cMajor changes have occurred since the crisis which have improved behaviour in firms, but public opinion broadly does not recognise these developments and tends to think that nothing has changed. Culture is an important part of demonstrating that change,\u201d Bailey said. But, he added: \u201cAs regulators, we are not able, and should not try, to determine the culture of firms. We cannot write a regulatory rule that settles culture.\u201d Speaking later at the City Week conference, Chris Cummings, chief executive of the CityUK lobby group, said that he had been told by US bankers that the attitude of regulatory regime in the UK was returning to normal. \u201cMy sense is the industry has weathered the tsunami of regulation,\u201d Cummings said.",
