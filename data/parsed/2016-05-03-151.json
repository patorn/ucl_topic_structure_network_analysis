  "body": "Name: Bore-out. Age: Meh. Appearance: Umph. OK, what\u2019s going on? Rien. Rien de rien. Stop it. Tell me. A 44-year-old Frenchman, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Desnard, is taking his former employers \u2013 a perfume company \u2013 to a tribunal because he claims they gave him \u201cbore-out\u201d. Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est que \u00e7a when it\u2019s at home? It is when you are \u201cmise en placard\u201d \u2013 put in a cupboard, metaphorically, given only menial tasks and deprived of all meaningful responsibility at work. Desnard says his bosses at Interparfums did this to him for four years and gave him bore-out. Like burnout, he says, but less interesting. Unless Emmanuelle B\u00e9art and Daniel Auteuil have a baby and call it Hermes Croissant, this is the Frenchest thing there will ever be. This guy is having an existential crisis about being bored at work? He says it was \u201ca descent into hell\u201d. He was ashamed of being paid for doing nothing. Why didn\u2019t he just move to England and pride himself on it instead? He could have become a god among disaffected men. Have you no pride? No. But I have Twitter. I have a Facebook account that helps me while away the hours of my understimulating employment. I can take 35 minutes to make a single cup of tea; 45 for a trip to the loo. If I\u2019ve had Weetabix for breakfast, the day\u2019s gone before I know it. I think Monsieur Desnard asks a little more out of life. He should have asked for a little more from his colleagues. Do they not gossip in France? Think of all the cinq \u00e0 sept they\u2019ve got to talk about! I don\u2019t know. Probably not in the same way we do. They probably exchange small slices of high-quality stuff instead of indulging in massive, vulgar gabfests like we do. As with gateaux, so with gossip. That won\u2019t fill the unforgiving days, will it? Non. Well, good luck to him. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I am behind on my work. Do you mean your Instagram-scrolling? I do. Tr\u00e8s bon. Do say: \u201cA fair day\u2019s work for a fair day\u2019s pay.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cBut a day\u2019s skiving for a day\u2019s pay is even better.\u201d",
