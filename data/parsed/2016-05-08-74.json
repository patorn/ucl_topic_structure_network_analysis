  "body": "Like a long-missed sun breaking through clouds after weeks of rain Jim Bolger has arrived with a serious Derby contender to clarify what had become a muddy Classic picture. Moonlight Magic was an emphatic winner of the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial here on Sunday, giving his Godolphin owners a huge chance of a first success in the Epsom race. The pre-trial chatter at Leopardstown centred on Aidan O\u2019Brien and his four runners, O\u2019Brien having failed to produce a convincing Derby contender. His Idaho was sent off favourite while Shogun, Ryan Moore\u2019s mount, also had his supporters. Moonlight Magic was allowed to start at 6-1 after a dismal 14-length defeat last month and there was widespread concern about the general health of the Bolger stable. While several of the trainer\u2019s horses had run with credit, he had been on a losing streak of 27 before bagging a Wexford maiden on Saturday. When the 74-year-old trainer won a Group Three early on this card it suggested the corner had been turned. An hour later his two runners took on O\u2019Brien\u2019s four in the trial and won the tactical battle hands down, Saafarr setting the pace with Moonlight Magic lying third until sweeping to the front in the home straight. Shogun and Idaho finished strongly to take the places, never getting closer than at the line, where the winner had only a length and a quarter in hand. But Moonlight Magic had this prize in his pocket some way from home and he is as likely as those behind to benefit from another quarter-mile at Epsom. So will he go? Kevin Manning, the winning jockey, indicated the colt might be \u201cmore of an Irish Derby type\u201d but that might have been the conservative response of a man who knows such decisions are not his to make. Bolger was initially playful, as is his wont, but eventually worked his way around to frank enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019d have to discuss it with the Godolphin people and arrive at a consensus. But, if it were left to me, I\u2019d be very keen to go.\u201d Indeed Bolger said Moonlight Magic was \u201cvery classy\u201d and \u201ccertainly as good today as St Jovite was when he won the Derrinstown\u201d. St Jovite was only second at Epsom, in 1992, but hacked up in both the Irish Derby and Ascot\u2019s King George. Asked to explain Moonlight Magic\u2019s reappearance flop, Bolger said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to fire and he was very quiet after it, so he just mightn\u2019t have been right. He wasn\u2019t at the top of his game and I hadn\u2019t caught it. I can be slow at times.\u201d Mischievous reporters invited Bolger to speak slightingly of this year\u2019s other Derby contenders but he has been to the circus before and dodged this custard pie. \u201cThey\u2019re good, they\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re always good for Epsom. Whatever wins it will be a good horse as usual. Don\u2019t you call it the best race in the world? \u201cThey\u2019re a pretty even bunch so far. I have to hold fire now until I see the Dante [at York on Thursday]. I wish I had a horse for it but I don\u2019t.\u201d Given that Godolphin have not exactly been regular winners of Derby trials, it seems likely that Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s organisation will smile on the idea of a tilt at Epsom. But they may have a choice to make, or two runners to saddle, as their colours were also carried to victory in a French trial at Saint-Cloud by the Andre Fabr\u00e9-trained Cloth Of Stars, who would have to be supplemented for Epsom. Whether or not that one comes over, surely Moonlight Magic will turn up in a month\u2019s time. He is on offer at 16-1 but could reasonably be half those odds after such a convincing performance in an open year. The question now is what O\u2019Brien will send. Now that Godolphin, the longstanding rivals of his Coolmore employers, have a live runner, it must be more likely that he will consider running his star filly Minding in an attempt to deny them a big moment of glory. Also in search of Classic glory, remarkably, is Kieren Fallon. The 51-year-old jockey scored here on Now Or Never and will be aboard the filly again in a fortnight\u2019s time when the pair try to land the Irish 1,000 Guineas, for which the bookies rate them 9-2 chances.
