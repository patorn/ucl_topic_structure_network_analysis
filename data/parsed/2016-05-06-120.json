  "body": "IT\u2019S HOTTING UP The key to success is staying calm. That\u2019s how The Fiver rolls. Look at all our success. The awards. The praise. The admiration. It\u2019s all thanks to keeping a cool head in pressure situations. Fine, it\u2019s 2.47pm on a Friday afternoon and The Fiver is staring at a blank screen and The Man has asked it to write about something called the Championship and it has no idea what the Championship is having spent all season writing gems about the Premier League and a small puddle is starting to materialise under its desk and sweat is dripping from its brow and it\u2019s starting to see pink spots and oh God here come the tears. Where were we? Something called Championship. Isn\u2019t that where Leicester City used to play? Then they won the Premier League. Rings a bell. The Championship, you say? Are you quite sure? But no, despite The Fiver posing the question several times, just to make sure, The Man wasn\u2019t after 300 words of searing piffle on Big Cup. More fool him, see, because giants such as Real Madrid and Barcelona don\u2019t play in the Championship. But he was adamant, banging his furious little fists on his desk and talking about how it\u2019s all set up for a really exciting final day in the Championship. Apparently there are clubs called Middlesbrough and Brighton & Hove Albion, and they both want to be Premier League clubs, like Leicester and Aston Villa. Ah. They\u2019re going to play each other in a play-off, or something like that, for the right to make up the numbers next season. And to make some serious numbers next season. Incredibly they\u2019re locked on points, with Middlesbrough\u2019s superior goal difference keeping them above Brighton. \u201cYou can\u2019t get carried away or overwhelmed as you\u2019ll start getting tense in the game,\u201d reckons Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale. \u201cWe will go there and play our normal game. We have to say it is another game and go and get the three points. One more win and we are in the Premier League.\u201d It\u2019s not winner takes all, of course, because it turns out Middlesbrough only need a draw to ensure their place in next season\u2019s Promised Land, while Nice Chris Hughton\u2019s Brighton need to take all three points at the Riverside, otherwise it\u2019s the play-offs for them. Just follow The Fiver\u2019s lead and it will all go smoothly. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWhoever has spoken has done it to hit me. But I\u2019m not here next season anyway so it\u2019s not my problem, but Bayern\u2019s. It\u2019s happened plenty of times over these past three years. It\u2019s normal for me to talk to my players and staff and give them my opinion, but there are people here who are talking because they want to hurt me. Maybe this person will still be here next season and clearly they haven\u2019t realised that they are not damaging me, but the club and the team. I won\u2019t be here, so it\u2019s the club\u2019s problem\u201d \u2013 just because Pep Guardiola\u2019s paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t out to get him. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Here\u2019s Football Weekly Extra, with a packed pod on all the midweek action.       FIVER LETTERS \u201cCan I be the first of 1,057 Monty Python pedants to highlight that Arthur Pewty never even got as far as telling the marriage guidance councillor to stop messing with his ravishing wife (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) \u2013 he exited stage left at the first sign of trouble. Nor did he lay a hand on his opponent. So, yeah, the comparisons with Manchester City continue\u201d \u2013 Dave Lambert (and no other Monty Python pedants). \u201cWith respect to the Gunners having absolutely nothing whatsoever left to play for (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), could I kindly remind The Fiver that St Totteringham\u2019s Day has not been cancelled. Yet\u201d \u2013 Chris Wimmer. \u201cAccording to that great source Wikipedia, there are 111 stadiums in Europe with a larger capacity than this year\u2019s Big Vase final venue. Now, I grant you some of those are for rugby and GAA, and that some of them are for Big Cup teams who we really don\u2019t want to be giving even more money. But surely there are a few large stadiums in there that aren\u2019t for teams that do well in Big Cup or teams that could reach the final of Big Vase? Please feel free to add your own Queen\u2019s Celtic Park punchline\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cAll this hullaballoo about Leicester winning the league, which was apparently the most unpredictable, unlikely event in the history of sport. Well, I remember the time The Fiver predicted three correct results in a row. This league win is nothing compared to that crazy occurrence\u201d \u2013 Dan Makeham. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Dan Makeham.

BITS AND BOBS Former England striker Frank Worthington has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, his daughter has announced. \u201cHe was diagnosed several years ago and has been holding it off with positive thinking and football,\u201d said Kim-Malou Worthington. South Yorkshire police sought to influence media reporting of the recent inquests into the deaths of 96 people in the Hillsborough disaster and secure positive coverage, according to a former communications specialist employed by the embattled force. \u201cI took that as being told my job was to tell the media what they would be reporting, which isn\u2019t ethical or even possible to do. No self-respecting member of the press is going to listen to that, especially from a press officer working for one of the culprits of the Hillsborough disaster,\u201d said Hayley Court. \u201cIt was an impossible task \u2013 and secondly, I just wasn\u2019t prepared to get involved in doing it.\u201d  J\u00fcrgen Klopp reckons there\u2019s no point complaining about Liverpool\u2019s meagre ticket allocation for the Big Vase final against Sevilla and that ticketless fans should head for Basel/Basle/Baaarl/Barzuhl on 18 May. \u201cIt\u2019s worth going even if you don\u2019t have a ticket to enjoy the city,\u201d he cheered. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino still isn\u2019t that fussed about the way his team Spursed their way to Monday\u2019s 2-2 draw at Chelsea. \u201cI hear in the last few years that, in the past, Tottenham were soft but now, we start to show character,\u201d he tub-thumped, as Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 accepted an FA charge of violent conduct. Borussia Dortmund and Germany midfielder Ilkay G\u00fcndogan will miss Euro 2016 after suffering a dislocated kneecap in training. Less of a miss at the Euros, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has suffered more knee-knack and faces two months out. \u201cEngland have quite a few problems up front so I think it\u2019s bad,\u201d trilled Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Eurostar are planning to ban alcohol on some trains during Euro 2016. \u201cThroughout the tournament, there are two levels of alcohol restriction: zero alcohol, and limited alcohol,\u201d roared a spokesman. And Brazilian outfit Gr\u00eamio Osasco Audax hope to pull off another major shock when they face Santos in Sunday\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo state championship final. \u201cIn terms of shocks, Leicester is greater than Audax,\u201d cooed former Placar editor Mauricio Barros. \u201c[But] Audax is one of the biggest surprises in Brazilian football for years. They play such nice football, and always try to pass the ball.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? Sob on the Tyne. Memories, right there. That, and nine other things in our [Fiver counts fingers and thumbs.
