  "body": "Just as Lord Kitchener\u2019s probing stare and pointing index finger famously announced \u201cYour country needs you\u201d, so Uncle Sam transfixes the viewer with his eyes and finger beside the legend: \u201cFirst call \u2013 I need you in the Navy this minute! Our country will always be proudest of those who answered the first call.\u201d This 1917 poster by James Montgomery Flagg, adapted from Alfred Leete\u2019s 1914 image of Kitchener, forms part of an exhibition that explores how American artists galvanised public interest in the first world war, opening on Saturday at the Library of Congress in Washington. It is the first in a series of events at the library marking next year\u2019s centenary of America entering the war. This was an era before radio and TV became widespread when the poster was uniquely potent. The mastermind of the propaganda effort was George Creel, a journalist, politician and author. \u201cHe really thought art can play a major role and lobbied hard with the government to change hearts and minds,\u201d co-curator Katherine Blood said.     \u2018The camp library is yours: read to win the war.\u2019 Photograph: Library of Congress    Her colleague Sara Duke added: \u201cThis was the first time in American history that art was used in war. The result was amazing. Women donated their time working in factories, and we now know a lot of knitting was thrown away because so much of it was produced. There was a lot of mobilisation. Art played a role in making it socially necessary.\u201d The free exhibition, World War I: American Artists View the Great War, features 25 fine prints, drawings, cartoons, posters and photographs reflecting the focus of wartime art on patriotic and propaganda messages, drawn from the library\u2019s prints and photographs collections. An additional 70 photos will be visible in a slideshow. \u2018Draw \u2019til it hurts\u2019 Even with its late entry into the war under President Woodrow Wilson, the US produced more posters than any other country. Under orders to \u201cdraw \u2019til it hurts\u201d, many of the artists worked for the government\u2019s division of pictorial publicity, which promoted recruitment, bond drives, home-front service, troop support and camp libraries. In less than two years, the division\u2019s 300 artists produced more than 1,400 designs, including some 700 posters. Some images advocated for US intervention in the war, some encouraged hatred of the German enemy and some aimed at the home front, hoping to persuade Americans to change their eating habits so food could be sent abroad. They were encouraged to switch from meat and wheat to corn and fish, to plant victory gardens and to can fruit and vegetables. One of the posters on display, by Edward Penfield, shows US soldiers manning a machine gun and has the banner: \u201cThe Doughboys Make Good\u201d \u2013 the informal term \u201cdoughboy\u201d became popular for describing US soldiers in the first world war.     The Doughboys Make Good: Edward Penfield\u2019s first world war poster. Photograph: Library of Congress    But after the war ended in 1918, some complex messages emerged. A 1919 Red Cross poster, Facing the Future, shows injured men, including one who has lost a leg and is holding a crutch. It offers reassurance: \u201cUncle Sam offers training to every man disabled in the service. See that your man takes it.\u201d Blood said: \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating image. It\u2019s colourful and there is a white halo around the injured soldier. It\u2019s optimistic, but it also has the horrific consequences of war.\u201d One of the most poignant images is a 1919 lithograph by Maurice Becker, a Russian Jewish immigrant and radical artist who, as a conscientious objector to the war, was sentenced to 25 years hard labour in Fort Leavenworth disciplinary barracks. He was released soon after the war ended and drew the suffering of fellow conscientious objectors. Despite the exhibition, the centenary of the war is likely to be far more low-key in America than the recent cavalcade of commemorations in Europe. Typically it now only receives a couple of days\u2019 attention in American schools, Duke observed. \u201cFor Britain it impacted on a generation. For the US, the number of troops we sent there was miniscule compared to the British, French, German and Russian armies. We like to say we ended the war, but we know that\u2019s not the case. The effort that went into it is now long forgotten and completely overshadowed by world war two.\u201d The US mobilised 4.4 million personnel in the first world war (with 116,516 killed) compared with 12 million from Russia, 8.9 million from the British empire, 8.4 million from France and 5.6 million from Italy, according to a tally compiled by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Some 16.4 million Americans served in the second world war, 5.8 million in Korea and 8.7 million in Vietnam.     Facing the Future: CF Chambers\u2019 poster on the aftermath of the war. Photograph: Library of Congress    Duke added: \u201cIt\u2019s what happened after the war that\u2019s striking to me: the commitment to help. Single women who went to Europe to try and make life better whatever little ways they could.\u201d The Library of Congress prints and photographs division has an extensive archive of first world war-era posters, with some 1,900 posters created between 1914 and 1920 available online.",
