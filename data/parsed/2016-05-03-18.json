  "body": "Bath are looking to recruit a top-quality coach from outside the Premiership to help them bounce back from a year of on-field underachievement and off-field acrimony. But Mike Ford, the head coach, is adamant that he retains the support of the club\u2019s owner, Bruce Craig, and is already working hard on Bath\u2019s strategy for next season. Regardless of the outcome of their final league fixture against Leicester this Saturday, Bath will finish ninth in the table and have missed out on qualification for the European Champions\u2019 Cup. With Stuart Hooper, the captain, retiring, the scrum coach Neal Hatley joining England\u2019s management team and the fallout still reverberating from Sam Burgess\u2019s return to rugby league, Craig\u2019s vision of a trophy-laden era at the Rec has yet to materialise. Following a meeting this week, nevertheless, Craig is still backing Ford to plot the way forward. \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d the former England assistant coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s not banned me from signing players. I sit down with him every week and we\u2019ll do it again after we play Leicester. He\u2019s disappointed but, if anything, he\u2019s got more energy to succeed. \u201cHe\u2019s been brilliant. He wants us to be the best club side in Europe and he\u2019s very committed to that. There\u2019s been a lot of chat about Bruce but he\u2019s been nothing but a tower of strength for the club.\u201d With Hatley poised to join England this month once his Bath duties are complete, there is a vacancy for a fresh face, quite possibly from the southern hemisphere. Leicester have benefited hugely from the input of the former All Black Aaron Mauger and his impact has not gone unnoticed in Bath. \u201cWe\u2019re having a look at the coaching structure and there\u2019s an opportunity for someone new to come in, potentially not from the Premiership,\u201d Ford said. \u201cClearly we\u2019ve got to improve. There were a lot of things that weren\u2019t good enough this year. \u201cLooking back I should have ripped it up after we lost the Premiership final last season. But there was a World Cup and players were away. We got ourselves into a hole that we couldn\u2019t get out of.\u201d With the Wales internationals Taulupe Faletau and Luke Charteris confirmed arrivals and a further forward signing due to be announced on Wednesday, Ford admits recruitment \u201cis still ongoing\u201d to cover the gaps left by the departure of the Argentine wing Horacio Agulla and others. \u201cOur starting team is going to be very good but we need more depth in the squad. We need to be the hunters again and get our hunger back because we\u2019ve not won anything over the past three years. It hurts and we need to use that feeling as motivation this summer.\u201d With the Japanese No8 Amanaki Mafi having abruptly left the club amid reports of a bust-up with a member of the club\u2019s medical staff and the Samoan international flanker Alafoti Fa\u2019osiliva due to be sentenced on Friday after pleading guilty to assaulting a university student, Ford concedes it has not been a campaign he will personally remember with great affection. \u201cI think I must have run over a black cat or something. A lot of good things have happened over the last couple of years but we\u2019ve become a story, haven\u2019t we? Sometimes things happen that are out of your control. It\u2019s just highlighted because of the season we\u2019ve had.\u201d",
