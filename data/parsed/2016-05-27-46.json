  "body": "MPs are to investigate how many occupational pension schemes are at risk of failing, amid inquiries into the collapse of BHS and the debate over the future of the \u00a315bn British Steel pension fund. The Commons work and pensions select committee, which is already investigating the \u00a3571m deficit at BHS scheme, said on Friday night it would launch a wide ranging inquiry into the problem, probably starting in the autumn. Workers\u2019 occupational pensions have been forced centre stage in recent months by BHS\u2019s collapse and by Tata Steel\u2019s potential sale of its UK business.  Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees who were under retirement age when the company went into administration in March may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result.    Related: Tweaking pensions law to save Tata Steel UK would be a risky move    The British Steel pension scheme, one of Britain\u2019s largest defined benefit plans with 130,000 members, is also facing cuts as the government races to put it on a sound footing to help facilitate a sale. The latest figures show it has liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and the deficit has ballooned to \u00a3700m. Announcing the broader inquiry, the chair of the committee, Frank Field, said: \u201cThe state of the British Steel pension scheme is further worrying evidence of a wider danger to one of the biggest savings successes in Britain during the last century \u2013 occupational pension schemes. The select committee\u2019s in-depth case study on BHS is illustrating how such schemes are already creaking from rising life expectancy and record low returns on capital.  \u201cPension law and regulation must urgently adapt to the issues of the future, rather than the problems of the past. We should be under no illusions that British Steel is a special case. The whole savings edifice is in danger.\u201d The Labour MP said 11 million workers have private defined benefit pensions, but more than 5,000 of the associated pension schemes are in deficit by \u00a3805bn overall.  \u201cThis will be a major inquiry considering radical solutions to one of the great problems of this age,\u201d headded.  Last week the committee joined forces with the business, innovation and skills committee to question the heads of the Pension Protection Fund and the Pensions Regulator about the BHS debacle. In the coming weeks, the committees will be offering some of the best free theatre in London when on 8 June they quiz senior BHS managers and Dominic Chappell, the former bankrupt who controversially bought the department store chain for \u00a31 from Sir Phillip Green, who will be appearing a week later.",
