Governor Mark Carney also warned Brexit could knock the pound sharply lower, stoke inflation and raise unemployment. That would leave the Bank with a difficult balancing act as it decides whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates to counter opposing forces, Carney added. He said there were a range of possible scenarios for the economy in the event of Brexit and these \u201ccould possibly include a technical recession\u201d \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP. \u201cA vote to leave the EU could have material economic effects \u2013 on the exchange rate, on demand and on the economy\u2019s supply potential \u2013 that could affect the appropriate setting of monetary policy,\u201d Carney told a news conference. He was speaking as the Bank released its latest forecasts for the economy showing a softer outlook for growth and as it announced a decision to hold interest rates at their record low of 0.5%. With the 23 June referendum clouding the economic outlook, all nine of the Bank\u2019s interest rate setting committee agreed borrowing costs should be left on hold. Against the backdrop of tight opinion polls, the Bank described the referendum on EU membership as \u201cthe most immediate and significant risk\u201d for the UK\u2019s economic outlook.  Minutes from the committee\u2019s meeting showed it discussed the implications of both a vote to remain in the EU \u2013 seen as the more likely outcome based on current polls \u2013 and a vote to leave. It was the Bank\u2019s most detailed assessment yet of potential Brexit effects. The Bank warned a vote to leave the EU could:  Push the pound lower, \u201cperhaps sharply\u201d. Prompt households and businesses to delay spending. Increase unemployment. Hit economic growth. Stoke inflation.  Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe implication is that UK recession would be a very real risk.\u201d Carney also warned of the risk of a spillover to international markets from the uncertainty around the vote, saying almost everyone he met wanted to talk about Brexit. \u201cThis issue is the No 1 issue that is raised with me and my colleagues every time we meet another central banker, finance minister, the head of a major corporation, and most small business owners.\u201d The governor\u2019s remarks brought renewed criticism from campaigners for the UK to leave the EU. The former chancellor Lord Lamont accused Carney of carelessness, and said \u201ca prudent governor would simply have said that \u2018we are prepared for all eventualities\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe governor should be careful that he doesn\u2019t cause a crisis. If his unwise words become self-fulfilling, the responsibility will be the governor\u2019s and the governor\u2019s alone,\u201d said Lamont. \u201cThere are huge opportunities for the UK outside the EU. We are a strong economy and can stand on our own two feet like all other modern, independent countries.\u201d But Carney defended his intervention as legitimate and cited the Bank\u2019s responsibility to explain any \u201cmajor risk\u201d to its forecasts.    Related: Bank of England: Brexit would mean 'lower growth and higher inflation' - live    The Bank noted the pound had already depreciated 9% since a November peak and that half of that was down to the \u201crisks associated with a vote to leave the European Union\u201d. Carney further expounded the risks of a leave vote in a letter to George Osborne, one of the leading figures in the campaign to remain in the EU. The letter was the latest in a series, regularly sent to explain why inflation was still far below the Bank\u2019s government-set target of 2%, but this time it contained a lengthy section about the referendum. The chancellor seized on Carney\u2019s remarks as showing \u201cBritain would be poorer\u201d in the event of Brexit. On the Bank\u2019s predicted trade-off, Osborne said any outcome would \u201cimpose costs on families\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is the kind of lose-lose situation that a vote to leave the EU creates.\u201d    Leaving EU would stoke inflation & hit growth, leaving MPC with no-win choice on interest rates. UK would be poorer https://t.co/pfg1rBArlw\u2014 George Osborne (@George_Osborne) May 12, 2016    However, Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee were careful to note that there were factors weighing on the UK economy beyond next month\u2019s referendum. Those included the state of households\u2019 finances against the backdrop of further government cuts, the outlook for the UK\u2019s relatively weak productivity performance, and the prospects for the global economy.  The Bank also warned against expecting a rapid rebound in economic activity in the event of a vote to stay in the EU given some business projects that had been deferred before the vote could take time to restart. The inflation report\u2019s forecasts were made on the basis the UK remains in the EU, keeping to the usual practice used before general elections of assuming the status quo prevails.  The Bank\u2019s view of the global economy had changed little since the last report in February. But it cut the outlook for the domestic economy to GDP growth of 2% this year, down from 2.2% pencilled in back in February. David Cameron also capitalised on the Bank\u2019s Brexit warnings. He tweeted:    The Bank of England is right to warn leaving the EU could cause lower growth and unemployment to rise - that would hurt working people.\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) May 12, 2016    There was more support for the remain campaign from the White House, where the chairman of the council of economic advisers said a vote to leave the EU would hurt Britain and Europe as well as the global economy. Jason Furman told Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt newspaper: \u201cYou can certainly argue about whether the damage a Brexit would cause would be small, medium or big but it would definitely cause damage, especially for the Brits but also for the Europeans and the global economy.\u201d He added: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more uncertainty at the moment.\u201d",
