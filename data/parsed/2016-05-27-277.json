John Bray was executive principal at Pearson\u2019s Cape York Academy for six months last year before quitting, in part over his disillusion with the effect of the multimillion-dollar \u201cdirect instruction\u201d syllabus wholly imported from the US. Bray said the rigidly-scripted curriculum had compounded student disengagement in Aurukun, along with the \u201ccomplete distrust\u201d of the school by parents amid the punitive approach of welfare reforms. Both were contributing factors to events leading to the town\u2019s schooling crisis, he said. Bray said touted literacy and numeracy improvements under the program when compared to other schools in Cape York with regular state funding did not justify the cost.    Related: Queensland ministers fly to Aurukun after more violence flares    \u201c[Direct instruction] is inappropriate and the evidence is clear,\u201d Bray told Guardian Australia. The primary school was shut down this week until next term, after teachers evacuated Aurukun for the second time this month over safety fears.  They were triggered by a series of alleged violent carjackings of the school principal, Scott Fatnowna, and targeted attacks on teachers\u2019 accommodation by local youths. The school\u2019s closure prompted federal MP Warren Entsch to describe Aurukun as a \u201cfailed social experiment\u201d, with hundreds of millions of dollars spent on programs advocated by Pearson representing \u201cpoor value for money\u201d. Pearson in return has accused Entsch of not achieving enough for the community and said Aurukun was \u201cthe Afghanistan of teaching\u201d. He has blamed police for a lack of enforcement and criticised the state government for the standard of teacher accommodation and its decision to close down the school, saying a minority of youthful troublemakers had controlled it like \u201cpuppeteers\u201d.  In a statement on Friday, Pearson said it was \u201castounding to see that the school is now the scapegoat of what is very clearly a law, order and policing problem\u201d. \u201cMany ignorant statements have been made in the last 24 hours claiming that the education model has failed in Aurukun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe naysaying nonsense is not supported by verified evidence about student participation and achievement, and the important place the school plays in the slow path to restoring social norms in Aurukun.\u201d Pearson said school attendance rates had gone backwards in recent years after a peak of 75% in early 2011. But he said this was \u201cundercut by grog and community violence\u201d and was \u201cstill well above pre-[Cape York welfare reforms] averages of less than 40%\u201d. Bray, who at the Cape York Academy oversaw schools at Aurukun, Coen and Hopevale, is the first educator involved with the direct instruction program to speak publicly. Bray said he agreed the school \u201chas to be the centerpiece of the community but if the school is a beacon in the community, it should be the best place in the world kids want to come to\u201d.  \u201cIf it was, you\u2019d have 100% attendance, wouldn\u2019t you? Which means something\u2019s not working.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got teachers working their arses off up there doing a great job under an approach that is obviously not working.\u201d Despite there being a new building available for secondary education at the school, Aurukun teenagers only have the option of going to boarding school elsewhere. Pearson has called for the expansion of a placement program that has put other teenagers to work in abattoirs and as fruit pickers. There are estimates of up to 70 disengaged secondary school-age children in Aurukun. Bray said about a third of Aurukun students suffered \u201csevere mental health issues due to trauma\u201d and that the curriculum had failed to address this. \u201cIt needs to be a relationship-based approach before you do anything else \u2013 forget about bloody literacy and numeracy for a moment,\u201d he said.   Related: Aurukun elders say group of teenagers controlling government 'like puppeteers'    The literacy and numeracy gains \u2013 which followed attendance rates \u2013 were underwhelming given \u201cthe amount of funding put into it\u201d, he said. \u201cWhen you compare [it] to other Indigenous communities, like Pormpurraw, which is just across the Cape, they\u2019ve got a quarter of the funding from the state government and they\u2019re ripping it,\u201d he said. Naplan results from 2014 showed Pormpurraw, with a similar remote Indigenous profile, outperformed Aurukun on all five measures among year three students. It had 79% to Aurukun\u2019s 61% above the national minimum standard in reading; 93% to 34% in writing; 93% to 63% in grammar; 73% to 55% in spelling; and 87% to 76% in numeracy. Pormpurraw did so using the regular Australian curriculum. It is involved in a teacher training program run by the Stronger Smarter Institute, for which Bray began working in October. The institute was founded by respected Indigenous educator Chris Sarra, who said he also felt compelled to speak about widespread teacher disquiet with direct instruction now Aurukun had reached a crisis point. \u201cI\u2019ve been to conferences where I\u2019ve had teachers come up to me afterwards and break down and cry because they just feel like they\u2019ve had it jammed down their throats and they feel like they can\u2019t speak out about it because it just blows up in their face and they get abused,\u201d Sarra told Guardian Australia. \u201cOne of the great tragedies in all of this is not only kids disengaging but exceptional quality teachers disengaged and walking away as well. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed to transform remote schools is the best quality, top-gun teachers, and jamming the direct instruction program down their throats has directly caused the best quality teachers to walk away.\u201d Direct instruction was introduced by the Cape York Academy six years ago with $8m in funding, originally from the state government, and then $22m in 2014 by the Abbott government for a rollout to other remote schools. Entsch said he \u201cnearly choked\u201d when he found out his own government was funding the rollout and predicted some Indigenous students would suffer under it. Sarra said Pearson\u2019s comparison of Aurukun to Afghanistan showed an \u201cincredibly na\u00efve understanding about the realities on the ground there\u201d. \u201cI wonder how long he can keep up this kind of tactic of distracting people from what the real issue is,\u201d he said. The \u201coff the shelf\u201d direct instruction syllabus been criticised for its culturally inappropriate, US-centric features. A 2013 report for the Australian council for education research found that school staff and community members widely reported positive outcomes from the initiative. But these outcomes \u201cspecially around student learning [had] proven difficult to quantify\u201d because the data expected to measure them had \u201ctoo much missing information\u201d, the report concluded.   Related: 'We fear for our lives': Aurukun women demand end to Cape York violence    Sarra said direct instruction was \u201cbasically a remedial program that\u2019s expensive, the money goes to America and is proven to disengage kids who are otherwise pretty bright\u201d. \u201cIt might have relevance to some kids in America but it has no relevance to the everyday lives of children in Aurukun,\u201d he said. \u201cIf government was serious about providing quality education they could spend $150,000 over 12 months and have a specialist curriculum writer go to Aurukun, live in Aurukun, sit down with people and design a local school curriculum. \u201cThat\u2019s going to excite the kids; that\u2019s going to sit well with parents and elders. That\u2019s going to nurture a strong sense of cultural identity while at the same time enable the pursuit of excellence so that kids can thrive in modern society. \u201cThe whole direct instruction program and the assumption this is the answer is a kick in the guts for Aboriginal communities and for the teaching profession.\u201d",
