  "body": "Anyone raised on the Disney version of Aladdin may be surprised by Adam Green\u2019s take on the Arabian Nights tale. Green, who rose to fame as one half of the early 2000s indie-rock band the Moldy Peaches, has created an acid-dipped retelling of Aladdin set in a papier-mache world, ruled by a sultan played by painter Francesco Clemente, with a princess that Green describes as \u201ckind of like a Kardashian\u201d, and a magic lamp outfitted with a 3D printer. Green stars as the titular character, alongside Natasha Lyonne, former child star Macaulay Culkin, Alia Shawkat, Zoe Kravitz, Devendra Banhart and the Moldy Peaches\u2019 guitarist Jack Dishel who plays a hilarious double role. Along with them are many more actors and musicians romping through a cartoon come to life \u2013 which is exactly what Green had in mind. \u201cI think a lot in cartoons,\u201d said Green. \u201cSo I thought it would kind of be fun to make a universe that\u2019s sort of my own amusement park, and this is what the characters I\u2019m singing about in my songs look like.\u201d             What started out as a pipe-dream project spit-balled by friends was eventually partially funded by a $50,000 Kickstarter campaign. Perhaps because of the financial backing from fans, Green took this film much more seriously than his last endeavor, at least according to its star, Macaulay Culkin. \u201cWhen he came to his first film, The Wrong Ferrari, almost all the lines and everything were just written on index cards, so somebody would say something, then he would pull out an index card and hand it to the next person, they would say something, and so forth,\u201d says Culkin. \u201cHe actually wrote a script this time.\u201d     Adam Green: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of autobiographical elements to my version of Aladdin.\u2019 Photograph: PR handout    In the film, which Green wrote, directed and acts in, Aladdin is a musician who has lost his mojo. He is about to be dropped from his record label when he happens upon a magic lamp that 3D-prints everything a musician could need to succeed, including ecstasy tablets, pointy boots and an asparagus chair. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of autobiographical elements to my version of Aladdin,\u201d said Green, who may or may not be kidding. \u201cI like to take things like symbols and twist and distort them and sort of make them my own version, and that\u2019s something I do in all my different kinds of artwork,\u201d says Green, who also works as part of 3MB, a freeform art collective with Culkin and fellow musician Toby Goodshank. Green had a gaggle of collaborators eager to work with him on the project. Lyonne and Culkin and most of the cast are friends with Green and willing to jump on board with whatever project he suggests. \u201cI love collaborating with him in any kind of capacity,\u201d said Culkin. \u201cI was a yes before the thing was even written.\u201d  Lyonne had a similar experience. \u201cHe said he was going to play Aladdin in this movie and I asked if I was going to be in it and he said: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re going to play their mother.\u2019\u201d She was barely 30, and Green was 29. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t just \u2018women in Hollywood getting screwed again,\u2019\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cIt just made sense in the weird out-of-space world.\u201d    Related: Adam Green's Aladdin: \u2018We did everything we could to make it not feel like work\u2019    She was happy to contribute to the project. \u201cIf Mac and Alia and Adam are going to call me and ask me to leave my apartment and take a 15-minute Uber ride to shoot this thing for three days, no problem,\u201d says Lyonne.  Before the film could come to life, the sets had to be built, which was a serious undertaking. \u201cMy friend Dustin Yellin, who\u2019s an artist in Brooklyn, let me use a corner of his studio and me and one other dude started to make props,\u201d Green said. He started posting pictures of his props to Instagram, which his followers saw as an invitation to help. \u201cEventually the crew grew to 20 people making props in a warehouse. It took about four months. We built 30 sets and almost 500 props.\u201d As the array of props grew, so did the budget. \u201cI ran laps around the budget like five times,\u201d says Green, who ended up reaching into his own pocket for the film, as well as working with co-producers to fund the project. Filming took place in 2014 in a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Approaches to the acting varied. \u201cHaving seen The Wrong Ferrari, I was pretty clear that this was not going to be the traditional narrative, so I didn\u2019t do a ton of mothering research for the role,\u201d says Lyonne. \u201cI didn\u2019t study how to mother a child who is the same age as you and emerged fully grown.\u201d  Culkin was impressed with Green\u2019s determination to make it happen. \u201cHe actually got SAG [Screen Actors Guild] waivers and had to deal with the union and everything, it was really amazing,\u201d says Culkin. However, Green found the process frustrating. \u201cThe actual arc of actually making the movie in a four-year span is enormously fun to me. And the day-to-days are absolutely maddening,\u201d he says, noting that he made the whole process longer, by creating an album to accompany the film. Culkin has not been on camera much lately, opting for quirky roles in his friends\u2019 productions, as when he showed up in Dishel\u2019s web series :DRYVRS playing a grown-up version of Kevin McCallister, his character from Home Alone, who is now an Uber driver in New York City and appears to suffer from PTSD. In Aladdin, Culkin plays an Occupy-style protester, who is willing to die for his beliefs. He plays the role with conviction, and only the barest hint of irony. He was happy to spend his summer helping his friend realize his arthouse dream. \u201cThis is a passion project, something that he needed to do. It was an itch that needed to be scratched,\u201d said Culkin. The resulting film is a visually engaging and dizzyingly goofy cinematic oddity that is incredibly fun to watch. \u201cIt was fascinating to watch an idea that was already so out-there take shape and become what it is now,\u201d said Lyonne. \u201cWhen I was sitting at CineFamily watching the thing, I was really excited for Adam. I was blown away.\u201d That said, the film is not necessarily for every taste. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether or not he saw this as something that was going to be accessible to the masses or not,\u201d said Culkin. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique, one-of-a-kind kind of piece. Nobody can do this by accident, you know what I mean?\u201d  \u201cIf I had seen this movie as a stoned teenager, I probably would have had a pretty good time,\u201d said Lyonne. \u201cAs a cellphone-addicted 36-year old and the designated driver, it\u2019s a different experience.\u201d She sees the film as straight out of the Fellini or Jodorowsky playbook and enjoyed working on a film that didn\u2019t suffer from what she called \u201cToo Serious Syndrome\u201d. It\u2019s clear that everyone on set is having fun, too, as they team up to help one of their own realize his artistic vision. Green knows it, too. \u201cThese guys are my close friends, they helped me to kind of make one of my dreams come true,\u201d said Green. \u201cIt\u2019s so special because of that. It\u2019s the best piece of artwork I\u2019ve ever made in my life.\u201d  Adam Green\u2019s Aladdin is available for download on iTunes and Amazon now in the US and will be available worldwide on 12 May",
