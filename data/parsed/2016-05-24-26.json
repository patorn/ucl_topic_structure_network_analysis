Goldie Sayers, who was fourth in the javelin, and Britain\u2019s 4x400m men\u2019s relay team \u2013 Martyn Rooney, Robert Tobin, Michael Bingham and Andrew Steele \u2013 who also finished fourth, could be bumped up to medal status after prohibited substances were allegedly found in samples from rivals who were placed above them.   Related: Yelena Isinbayeva says Russia\u2019s Olympic ban violates her human rights    The Russian state news agency Tass said 11 of the 14 alleged positives \u2013 from a total of 31 across 12 countries \u2013 were by individuals competing in track and field events, casting further doubt over Russia\u2019s participation in athletics at the Rio Olympics this summer. Details have emerged after retrospective testing by the International Olympic Committee, which examined 454 urine samples from Beijing using new techniques. Retrospective testing from London 2012 is set to be completed by the end of this month. Steele, part of the relay team in China, admitted to mixed emotions at the news. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get carried away until the news is officially confirmed but right now my emotions are a bizarre mixture of happiness and anger. It is very unusual to celebrate something as special as an Olympic medal eight years on and of course I\u2019ve missed out on standing on the podium at the Olympic Stadium in Beijing. \u201cWe were quite a young team in Beijing but we were frustrated to finish fourth, because I think we ran the fastest 4x400m time ever in an Olympics that didn\u2019t earn a medal. To be honest, we didn\u2019t expect Russia to be a threat. We thought if we ran 2:58 we\u2019d get a medal but the guy who is alleged to have doped ran a 43.4 sec 400m, which was incredibly fast. After that we had our suspicions. I can\u2019t help thinking how much an Olympic medal would have changed our lives.\u201d   Related: Former head of Russian anti-doping lab to be interviewed by Wada    Asked if those athletes bumped up to medal status should be able to stand on the podium in Rio, he said: \u201cDefinitely. Not only would it be a nice consolation prize for all us athletes who were deprived of a rightful medal but it would show that the IOC are acknowledging the issue.\u201d Match TV in Russia and Tass named the bronze medal-winning high-jumper Anna Chicherova, who won gold at London 2012, among those who tested positive from Beijing. Other names include Maria Abakumova, who won javelin silver, and Denis Alekseyev, a member of the Russian bronze-winning 4x400m relay team. The 50km walk bronze medallist, Denis Nizhegorodov, was also named among the suspected dopers while the three positives outside track and field came from weightlifting and rowing. While the IOC has yet to confirm the results Chicherova\u2019s coach, Yevgeniy Zagorulko, told Tass: \u201cThree days ago, Anna received a notice that her doping sample from the Beijing Olympic tested positive after a re-check and she called me. So far, this is at the development stage and this has not yet been finally confirmed. But all are aware of this and are dealing with the issue.\u201d The IOC will not formally name those guilty of doping until \u201cB\u201d samples have been examined at the start of June but the revelations put further pressure on the International Association of Athletics Federations to uphold its current suspension of Russia until after the Rio Olympics this summer. A decision will be made on 17\u00a0June. A statement from the Russian Ministry of Sport read: \u201cThe Ministry of Sport is extremely disappointed that Russian athletes are among those found to have violated anti-doping rules at the 2008 Beijing Olympics after retesting their samples. All the athletes found cheating should face corresponding sanctions. We have taken numerous steps to eradicate the issue of doping, and understand that the roots of the problem, particularly in athletics, go back to the past.\u201d",
