Yet releasing professionals during their busy, and sometimes unpredictable schedules, can be a struggle. Therefore, it is not a coincidence that online learning is becoming very popular among this group.  The need for high quality training resources As Candace Miller from the National Skills Academy for Health says: \u201cOur primary care workforce has a major role to play within transformed health and care services. So it is vital that they have access to high quality training resources that are relevant to the contexts in which primary care is delivered. And, with a busy workload, having ready access to those resources at times that fit in with service pressures is really important. It is no surprise therefore that elearning is becoming an increasingly popular means of developing primary care staff, ensuring they have the knowledge and expertise to deliver great care.\u201d In order to ensure we meet the needs of our clients, Skills for Health, in partnership with the National Skills Academy for Health \u2013 which works with more than 340 small and medium sized employers \u2013 has recently developed a suite of statutory and mandatory elearning specifically for the primary care sector. The courses were developed by primary care experts to allow staff to undertake training anywhere they have an internet connection, thereby reducing the need for day releases. The courses comply with all the latest relevant legislation and guidance and are based on the core skills training framework learning outcomes.   Roland Gude, strategic director at Sentinel Healthcare Southwest CiC who was involved in the development of the courses, says: \u201cThe relevance of the courses and their ability to be completed in remote locations in the GP\u2019s own time is definitely a unique offering.\u201d  Primary care courses:  Conflict resolution  Equality, diversity and human rights  Fire safety  Infection, prevention and control (clinical)  Infection, prevention and control (non-clinical)  Health, safety and welfare  Moving and handling  Patient moving and handling   You can access all of these new contextualised programmes here Skills for Health primary care courses.  Elearning is an alternative to traditional training methods and has become a vital tool to continued education for primary care professionals. With elearning, users can take their time learning the information. Farzana Hussain, a GP principal, who took part in a trial of the elearning service, says: \u201cI don\u2019t usually respond well to elearning and find it a bit dry but with the videos and interactive topics the learning was brought to life and the information was really easy to digest.\u201d Coming soon \u2026  As the number one provider of elearning to the NHS, Skills for Health is avidly working with and listening to experts to bring the latest elearning to you. A new look elearning platform and an immunisation update module will be launching soon. If you would like to speak with someone regarding your elearning needs, please click here.
