  "body": "\u201cRecent events have thrust our company under a spotlight \u2026\u201d It was with those words, in September 2014, that Lucas J W Johnson, one of the founding members of Silverstring Media, began a blogpost about his company. \u201cUnder a spotlight\u201d, it turned out, was something of an understatement. Silverstring Media had been targeted by the burgeoning online movement GamerGate, a loose affiliation of Twitter, Reddit and game forums users claiming to expose and protest corruption in the video games media. The company was accused of being \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201ccreepy\u201d, supposedly pushing ideologies and cultish practices that worked towards taking \u201cthe fun out of video games\u201d. Connections were established between Silverstring and the original GamerGate target Zoe Quinn. Then everything snowballed. \u201c[GamerGaters] got it into their heads that Silverstring Media was a PR firm, and that as such we must have been behind a conspiracy to release a series of \u2018gamers are dead\u2019 articles all at once from multiple different venues,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAs conspiracies do, that then spiralled into further corruption with the Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA), and eventually allegations that we work with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). We became \u2018the final boss\u2019 of GamerGate, responsible for all their woes.\u201d The thing is, Silverstring isn\u2019t a PR firm. As described by Johnson, it\u2019s a small-scale studio founded in Vancouver in 2013, which develops its own experimental video games, as well as acting as a narrative design and creative direction consultant across games and other digital media. Its clients don\u2019t include the likes of DiGRA or Darpa either. Instead, Silverstring typically works with independent artists and other small studios, and is inclined to work with people that are \u201ca little bit weird\u201d and a \u201clittle bit queer\u201d; qualities that also define the members of Silverstring. Specialising in digital storytelling (from ebooks to social media to games), Silverstring\u2019s work includes the interactive short story Azrael\u2019s Stop, which is told through tweet-sized updates, steadily building an impression of its single location through snippets of its daily activity. Similarly, in the acclaimed Glitchhikers, a car travelling a midnight road becomes the hub for multiple dreamlike conversations; the other founding member of Silverstring, Claris Cyarron, says they approached the car \u201cas if it were a room ... a meditation chamber whose ability to move you physically is secondary to its spiritual function\u201d.     Trailer for Azrael\u2019s Stop, an interactive short story told through tweet-sized updates   During the opening months of GamerGate, Johnson (considered \u201cthe possibly nefarious head of the company\u201d, as he puts it) had his personal information leaked and analysed online. One of the game designers that Silverstring works with got the same treatment, which led to an effort from GamerGate to get the designer fired from his full-time job at another company. \u201cWhile we did keep working, those four months were kind of time off and away from the industry, laying low and keeping quiet. That helped,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cBut I also want to be clear that the kinds of attacks we suffered as a company were nothing compared to what most women suffered. It sucked, yes, but we got off easy. We took time away, worked on our projects, commiserated with our friends, then got back to it.\u201d    Storytelling is extremely important. Culture reshapes itself one piece of media at a time  Claris Cyarron     While that is now all in the past, Cyarron says that she isn\u2019t sure that she\u2019s recovered from it even now. Her first impulse was to study the structures that enabled the GamerGate attacks to happen. \u201cBut of course, studying GamerGate is like wading through a toxic swamp, and I usually save all of that kind of action for my Dark Souls playthroughs,\u201d she said. What she ended up doing in order to deal with the harassment was to throw herself at the project Silverstring were working on at that time. Called Book of the Dead, it grew in size to become what Silverstring call a \u201cdigital triptych\u201d. It\u2019s a series of three projects about how we consume media. The first part, a game-like personality quiz based on those you can find on Facebook and Buzzfeed, was released in August 2015. \u201cIt was always going to be about the internet, but it wasn\u2019t always going to be about fandom, social media and harassment specifically,\u201d Cyarron said. \u201cWe\u2019re still slowly working on the final two parts but it\u2019s hard. I can\u2019t not make art about something like this, but when I sit down to work on it, I\u2019m back in fall 2014. I sometimes wonder if it\u2019d be healthier or better if I just walked away from the project and stopped trying to look back and make sense of it all, but I know I could never do that. We\u2019ll finish it and hopefully then I will have actually, fully recovered?\u201d What presumably hasn\u2019t helped with the recovery is that Cyarron also suffers from ADHD. It means that she can be impulsive, hyper, and space out frequently. Eight years ago she stopped taking medication for the condition, while it helped with focus, it led to a decrease in her creativity. To make up for it, she now has a strict morning routine: a calm breakfast, a long shower, 15 minutes\u2019 meditation, and then lets her mind wander as she breezes across the internet, reading, writing and sketching. She says this is a necessary ritual as she can\u2019t predict what her mind will be drawn towards each day. \u201cSitting down to get work done is often like dealing with a very fussy child that won\u2019t eat the food you\u2019ve prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I can coax my mind to get in the groove and eat its vegetables, sometimes it digs in, but most of the time, trying to get myself to focus on a specific task at a specific time is quite an endeavour. I\u2019ve learned to have a wide variety of tasks available and to let myself pick whatever I\u2019m feeling the most energised about at the time.\u201d It\u2019s not until the afternoon, her \u201cbest hours\u201d, that Cyarron will begin work on whatever Silverstring\u2019s major projects are at that time, aiming to put five or six hours of dedicated work into them. Even then, her wandering mind can let work on projects go astray. \u201cI\u2019ve once left [Johnson] waiting for feedback on a draft for over a year while I founded a non-profit, brought a publication on board, submitted to architecture competitions, and continued to crank out client work,\u201d Cyarron says. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to let a whole bunch of new ideas jump the queue, it just wasn\u2019t alluring to my annoyingly fickle mind at the time.\u201d    More compassionate, more inclusive and more nuanced stories make a huge difference, especially for younger generations  Claris Cyarron     To keep track of all the places her mind takes her, Cyarron has put together and regularly updates a Tumblr blog of inspirations. She usually looks it over once a week as part of her routine. It also helps to tackle her most recent problem of maintaining positivity and self-confidence; a side-effect of the ADHD she has. Fortunately, even when Cyarron is having a particularly stressful week, she has the support to find peace again. \u201cHaving a work environment of my own making and a business partner like Lucas who is so talented at production management and coordination has been absolutely instrumental in finding this peace,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich is great for me, but quite grim for the many people who really need but do not have such accommodation. Our education system needs to get better at offering alternative work approaches and strategies, and our employers must be encouraged to support good workers who may not function well in a standard environment.\u201d     Crypt of the Necrodancer, the multi-award-winning game on which Silverstring worked with Brace Yourself Games. Photograph: Brace Yourself    It\u2019s taken a long time for Cyarron to admit to herself that she needs to work differently from most people and have enough self-love to allow herself that admission. \u201cAt the very least my life would have been a lot more pleasant if I didn\u2019t have to suffer through two decades of schooling not at all designed for minds like mine,\u201d she said. However, while having ADHD has been a cause of great anguish for Cyarron over the years, it contributes to her creative role at Silverstring.  \u201cA wandering mind is one that is great at finding hidden connections, and drawing upon a wide array of inspirations,\u201d Cyarron says. \u201cWe\u2019re a small company and (especially during our early startup years) I believe my ADHD has helped us be more nimble and experimental. I\u2019m always getting excited about one weird thought or another, and so we always have a bank of interests and ideas. They often come back to us in interesting ways, adding a new layer to a client project, or morphing a single game into a triptych. It gives our work a certain kind of meandering sprawl; it takes you to places you weren\u2019t expecting.\u201d  Testament to this is Silverstring\u2019s portfolio of original works and those produced for clients. In the latter category, the duo contributed toward the story and cut-scenes in the multi-award-winning Crypt of the Necrodancer, an ingenious combination of dungeon crawling adventure and rhythm action game, and worked with Lazy 8 on the visually impressive alien landscape exploration sim, Extrasolar. Other projects include a soundtrack based on a series of live role-playing sessions, a virtual reality game, location-based and event-based experiences, and a dating app carrying an erotic architecture theme. What unites these disparate projects is an interest in telling compelling stories that may help to shape the world. \u201cStorytelling is extremely important,\u201d Cyarron says. \u201cCulture reshapes itself one piece of media at a time and it\u2019s important to always create with intention. Better, more compassionate, more inclusive and more nuanced stories make a huge difference, especially for younger generations who are just getting a sense of the shape of the world.\u201d The compulsion within Cyarron that has driven her to act creatively in the face of GamerGate rather than shy from it is crucial to her role at Silverstring. It started from a young age, born of a fascination with what she calls \u201carcane systems that unlock new understandings and methods\u201d. This led to her pursuing the sciences in her education, but as she was about to graduate, she recalls having \u201ca series of profoundly moving experiences in art museums\u201d. This would lead her on a winding path through art history, philosophy and architecture.

Photograph: Lazy 8    No matter the subject, then, Cyarron looks to interrogate the notion of edifice. \u201cI\u2019m interested in analysing the structure and codified establishment \u2013 including architecture \u2013 as presented in a work, and its impact on narrative,\u201d she says. \u201cI gravitate towards projects that are fresh and exciting but which also frustrate or alarm me. I want to agitate and stimulate, and I want to be agitated and stimulated.\u201d Fortunately, even when Cyarron is having a particularly stressful week, she has Johnson on hand via Google Hangouts, Slack, or simply over the phone to help her through it. Business partners they may be, but they are also close friends, creative fellows, and seem to complement each other. This relationship is summarised by their first meeting at a mutual friend\u2019s wedding, during which Cyarron remembers saying something like, \u201cI have these weird ideas about architecture and I\u2019m not sure how to get them out to people. How do you find an audience?\u201d To which Johnson replied by introducing her to Twitter. He pulls back the string, she fires the arrows.",
