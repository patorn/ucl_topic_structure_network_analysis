  "body": "Hitler for remain, Isis for leave. The battle for the hearts and minds of some of the world\u2019s most infamous mass murderers has almost reached peak nonsense. So when the Vote Leave battle bus pulled up at the JBMI aluminium processing plant outside Stafford, it seemed entirely possible that first off would be Uncle Joe Stalin saying he was over the moon to have signed for a club with such big ambitions. Instead we got Boris. The five-year plan would have to give way to the five-minute plan. \u201cGood morning, I mean good afternoon,\u201d said Boris, who was instantly surrounded by factory employees and a film crew. Labour\u2019s Gisela Stuart and Ukip\u2019s Douglas Carswell slipped past unrecognised. The Vote Leave campaign may aspire to be a broad church, but it only has one real star attraction. Which is just the way Boris prefers it. Boris loves attention, craves attention and isn\u2019t too fussy about what he does to get it. Yet people love him for it. Somehow this most Establishment of politicians is seen as having the touch of the common man.   Related: Farage accuses Mandelson and Labour of 'rubbing our noses in diversity'    Boris paced across the tarmac towards a heap of discarded Aston Martin engines, briefly tempted by the idea of picking one up before someone pointed out they were actually quite heavy. Slightly disappointed, he turned to give his first mini-speech of the day. The words tumbled out in a typical Borisovian stream of consciousness that didn\u2019t repay close scrutiny and \u2013 as ever \u2013 didn\u2019t get it. Everyone in the remain camp was part of a Fat Cats conspiracy, the EU renegotiations had been pure \u201cKabuki theatre\u201d and the discovery of a letter appearing to offer government contracts in exchange for supporting remain was \u201cthe biggest stitch-up since the Bayeux tapestry\u201d. \u201cWas I right about the Kabuki theatre?\u201d he asked Stuart, once the swarm of people had died down. \u201cI was making that bit up.\u201d Being someone who prefers to think before she speaks, Stuart said she wasn\u2019t sure. Boris didn\u2019t look too bothered. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain I was right.\u201d Miles Brough, the managing director of JBMI, led Boris off into a shed full of aluminium bars. It looked like a Brink\u2019s-Mat warehouse and Boris\u2019s eyes lit up. With that amount of bullion he could get Pol Pot and Chairman Mao onside. Brough started to bend Boris\u2019s ear. \u201cWe\u2019re confident we will be able to be do our own trade deals if we leave the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to have more faith in British industry.\u201d \u201cYes, folks,\u201d Boris shouted. \u201cBusinesses will be able to do their own trade deals if we leave the EU. People just need to have more faith in British industry.\u201d Being able to repeat back what someone has just said to him and make it sound as if he was the one to have come up with the idea is one of Boris\u2019s more formidable talents. No day out with Boris would be complete without some crowd-pleasing stunt. Today\u2019s was to burn money. Despite having been ticked off by the Treasury select committee for falsely claiming that Britain gives \u00a3350m to the EU each week, Boris had turned up with an oversized cheque for \u00a3350m made out to the EU and signed by the UK tax payer to put in the smelting furnace. \u201cI want to show people what\u2019s happening to their cash,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the fiery furnace in the Bible.\u201d Except that in the Bible, the three men in the fiery furnace all survived. Call that a backfire. Or an EU rebate. With that the bus headed off to Stafford town centre where 200 supporters had gathered to get a glimpse of their hero. Boris stood on a box with Carswell and Stuart on each side of him. \u201cThis is Gisela Stuart,\u201d he said. \u201cWho?\u201d the crowd replied. \u201cAnd this is Douglas Carswell,\u201d he continued. \u201cWho?\u201d the crowd again replied. The introductions over, Boris went back into free association Borisovian overdrive repeating the by now familiar tropes of the day. \u201cFat cats ... Biggest stitch-up since the Bayeux tapestry.\u201d The crowd laughed as if Boris had just won the improv prize on Britain\u2019s Got Talent. A little of Boris goes a long way or leave them wanting more? Take your pick. Within 15 minutes of his arrival he was back at Stafford station on his way home to London. The train pulled in. For the first time all day, a frown crossed his face. The train was decked out in Vote Remain livery.",
