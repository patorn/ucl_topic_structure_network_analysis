Greenpeace and the environmental group Kiko Network said in a joint report that Japan\u2019s determination to press ahead with a massive expansion in fossil fuel-based power production, with at least 43 plants to be built over the next 12 years, would come at a price to human health and \u201clock in carbon emissions for decades\u201d. The warning comes after a meeting of the G7 environment ministers in Toyama at the weekend, at which Japan repeated its pledge to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2013 levels by 2030 \u2013 a target campaigners have derided as woefully inadequate. \u201cSix large coal-fired power plants are planned within 100km of Tokyo. This massive expansion of coal power generation so close to huge urban areas like Tokyo is simply insane,\u201d said Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior coal campaigner at Greenpeace. \u201cWe could save thousands of lives cut short from air pollution if the government chose to embrace renewable energy over dirty coal. Japan is already considered the worst performer among the G7 when it comes to phasing out coal. If we are to have any chance of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, fossil fuels must be kept in the ground \u2013 not pumped into the air over our cities.\u201d   Related: Air pollution 'kills 7 million people a year'    Using atmospheric modelling to gauge the potential effects on public health, the groups projected that between 6,000 and 15,000 people would die prematurely in the Tokyo area over the new plants\u2019 average operating life of 40 years. Additional plants near the Osaka and Hyogo regions in western Japan would cause 4,000-11,000 premature deaths over a similar period. Projected particle pollution emissions from the new power plants around Tokyo would be equivalent to that from 13m passenger cars, the report said. A study published last week by Oxford University\u2019s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment said Japan risked being saddled with a fleet of worthless coal-fired power stations due to overcapacity and lower energy costs. The school\u2019s sustainable finance programme said overcapacity, combined with global moves to cut carbon emissions and the shift towards more cost-effective renewables, could leave the country with a stranded investment in coal plants worth $56bn \u201cThe expansion of coal in Japan appears to be predicated on a benign environment for incumbent utilities,\u201d the programme\u2019s director, Ben Caldecott, said. \u201cThe reality is that disruption in the power sector is accelerating. The idea that the power sector will remain relatively static and \u2018safe\u2019 for new coal-fired power stations is counter to the evidence we see internationally across the G20.\u201d The G7 environment ministers\u2019 meeting ended on Monday with a pledge that countries would not wait until the deadline of 2020 \u2013 set at last year\u2019s UN climate conference in Paris \u2013 to decide how they will achieve their long-term emissions cut of 80% by the middle of the century. But there are growing doubts that Japan, the only G7 country investing in new coal plants, will even achieve its 2030 target. In contrast to the US, Britain and other developed nations that are abandoning coal, Japan has turned to fossil fuels to fill the energy gap left by the closure of dozens of nuclear power plants in the wake of the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011.  All but two reactors remain offline while they undergo safety checks, while potential reactor restarts have encountered strong opposition from residents concerned about the facilities\u2019 vulnerability to powerful earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions.  Japan relied on nuclear for about 30% of its energy needs before Fukushima and, despite the shutdowns, the government says nuclear will generate 20-22% of total electricity by 2030. Its enthusiasm for coal is at odds with sections of the business community, however. Japanese trading house Mitsui said last week it would trim its thermal coal investments amid growing pressure worldwide for firms to lower their dependence on fossil fuels. \u201cConsidering the result of the global climate summit (in Paris), we basically plan to reduce thermal coal assets,\u201d Mitsui\u2019s chief executive, Tatsuo Yasunaga, told analysts.  Kimiko Hirata, the international director of Kiko Network, said: \u201cGovernments that have signed the Paris agreement must now legislate to keep fossil fuels in the ground and strongly support policies which lead to 100% renewable energy. \u201cFollowing the Fukushima disaster and subsequent shutdown of its nuclear fleet, Japan has been setting global records for energy consumption reduction, while renewables such as solar, have been booming. \u201cJapan needs to give renewables priority access to the grid and stop wasting resources trying to restart nuclear plants and expanding dirty coal.\u201d",
