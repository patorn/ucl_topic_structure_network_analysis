  "body": "A new sticker has appeared on the back of the Third Man Records minivan, which is blocking the driveway of Margo Price\u2019s home in Inglewood, East Nashville: \u201cYou puke, you pay!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s for us or another band,\u201d the 33-year-old singer says, before apologising profusely. She drove back from a show at 3am the night before so she could be home when her five-year-old son Judah woke up this morning. She\u2019s lost her voice, hasn\u2019t slept a full night in weeks, and her grass is so overgrown that it broke the lawnmower. Her car is littered with the debris of a fishing trip, which she quickly tidies away. With an outlaw country compilation on the stereo, she drives through the rapidly gentrifying suburb, pointing at new condos and modest houses that sell for a million dollars. The city is in a state of hyper-acceleration, and after 13 years slogging it out here, so is Price\u2019s career. In just two weeks, she released her first album, the honky-tonking Midwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter, performed on Saturday Night Live, and made history as the first solo female to debut at the top of the country album chart without having dented Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart.            That fact is significant: the singles chart is determined by traditional country radio airplay, but her success has mostly come from outside the Music City machine \u2013 not for any lack of trying to succeed within it. Third Man is, of course, Jack White\u2019s label, which signed her as its first country artist after the album had already been rejected 30 times. She paid to record it at Sun Studios, and Third Man liked the analogue approach. At the label\u2019s downtown store, the female staffers\u2019 hair is the same lilac as Price\u2019s album cover, which, given White\u2019s obsession over detail, is probably no coincidence. This being Nashville, Price\u2019s apparently quick rise has led to accusations that she has \u201ccut in line\u201d. \u201cThe thing that bothers me is presumptions like: \u2018She\u2019s getting favours done because she knows Jack White,\u2019\u201d Price says, over meatballs. She points out that another recent outlaw breakout, Chris Stapleton, played the Grammys when he was hardly known, and jabs her knife to slice to the heart of the criticism. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s like: \u2018How dare a woman do something before a man does?\u2019 Everybody gets different breaks all the time. No career is going to be the same as another career.\u201d She\u2019s learning the price of being a successful female country artist. \u201cAnything I say can and will be used against me,\u201d she says, sighing over a recent interview in which her point about only ever being compared to other female artists \u2013 rather than her influences Merle Haggard, George Jones and Waylon Jennings \u2013 was spun as beef between her and Texan songwriter Kacey Musgraves. It\u2019s hard to imagine what she would have to do to please her detractors. Price is a proud country traditionalist and scholar, who has spent more than a decade paying her dues. She grew up in tiny Aledo, Illinois; when she was three, her grandparents lost the farm where her dad also worked. \u201cThe 80s were a bad time for many farmers,\u201d Price says. \u201cCorporations would take over, you\u2019d see signs on the side of the road for AgriGro. Every year, the corn would get taller, more genetically modified.\u201d Price was a cheerleader who could flip the full length of the football field, but often got suspended. At college she mostly stayed home learning Led Zeppelin songs rather than go to her Spanish and theatre classes. Visiting Nashville in her second year confirmed her desire to quit and move there. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a plan,\u201d she admits. Waiting jobs supported her shows at open mic nights. Early on, a prospective manager invited her to his house and spiked her drink.            After meeting her (then-married) husband at a college party, Price wed at 25, holding the impromptu reception at a Broadway honky tonk, where the couple covered Bob Dylan\u2019s You Ain\u2019t Goin\u2019 Nowhere. They lived in a rat-infested house opposite a shop nicknamed the Stop\u2019n\u2019Rob, and worked at a catering company called Dream Come True. They were so poor, \u201cwe spent the whole winter next to a space heater under a blanket,\u201d she recalls. Sick of the city, they briefly lived in the Rocky mountains, and toured the country in a Winnebago with their roots rock band Buffalo Clover, which never took off. Price\u2019s failures never dimmed her fearlessness. \u201cI always wanted to be equal with the boys,\u201d she says. \u201cI never thought it was fair that women couldn\u2019t travel freely because it was dangerous. I\u2019d stay by myself on the North Carolina coast for a couple of weeks, with my dog and my gun, and my mom would be terrified. I told her, if I stay home, a lamp could fall on my head. You can\u2019t spend your whole life inside because you\u2019re scared.\u201d But in 2010, reality snapped into focus when Price gave birth to twins, losing one to a rare heart defect. \u201cI always struggled with depression long before I ever got pregnant,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the tipping point. Like, I\u2019ve got a failing career, not a lot going for me, and now this happens? It had felt like, at least I\u2019m gonna have these children and it\u2019s gonna look picture-perfect.\u201d She briefly collapsed, spending a couple of nights in jail after a drunken misdemeanour. Therapy, poetry and Judah gave her the strength to continue. Buffalo Clover released one more album, but she needed a fresh start, and sound. \u201cWhat I always liked about country music was the stories, the ability to talk about very real things like divorce and drinking and death and jail,\u201d she says. She didn\u2019t have to stretch for subject matter. Midwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter opens with the stately Hands of Time, which recounts her trials. \u201cAll I want to do is make a little cash,\u201d she belts, \u201cCause I worked all the bad jobs bustin\u2019 my ass.\u201d On This Town Gets Around, she skewers how the industry preys on female artists. \u201cI know so many girls that have felt like they\u2019ve been taken advantage of,\u201d Price says. \u201cNot only in the music business, but in every single career out there.\u201d Her songs have an implicit socioeconomic undercurrent: live, she makes a point of discussing the pay gap. Price knows the value of money, but cherishes her self-worth too much to sell out. Her definition of success is simple: \u201cNever having to ask for money from anybody, being able to put my son in a good school, and putting food on the table.\u201d Her recent achievements yielded one big spoil, a \u201965 Gibson acoustic that she bought after signing to Third Man, and pulls out at a radio session for digital station Sirius XM the next day. Wearing a Willie Nelson T-shirt, she chats with hosts Buddy Miller and Jim Lauderdale about the Bakersfield sound, Merle Haggard\u2019s passing and the decline of the Ray Price shuffle, and the men look awed as she powers through Hands of Time. \u201cIf there was any justice in this world, you\u2019d be at the top of mainstream country radio,\u201d Lauderdale says. Price downplays the compliment, feeling self-conscious about her tired voice. Does she worry that things are moving too fast? \u201cNo!\u201d she exclaims, horrified. \u201cI worried so long that I would sing to empty bars my whole life. I was singing my guts out, there would be five people into it. I\u2019m in my prime right now.\u201d  Midwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter is out now on Third Man.
