  "body": "Donovan, singer-songwriter Sunshine Superman was one of the first British psychedelic records, but it\u2019s primarily a love song. It was the mid-60s and I was appearing on Ready Steady Go!, playing Catch the Wind, when I saw this girl. I said to my mate Gypsy Dave: \u201cMy God, look at that girl. She\u2019s beautiful.\u201d We had a dance. She told me her name was Linda Lawrence and I was absolutely smitten. We got together for a while, but when I asked her to marry me she said no. She\u2019d just broken up with Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones. She\u2019d been the first celebrity girlfriend of the pop era and was tired of fleeing the paparazzi. She\u2019d also had a kid at 16. The police were going to take it away until her mum said she would look after it.          Listen to Catch the Wind by Donovan    Linda fled to Los Angeles. \u201cPlenty more fish in the sea,\u201d said Gypsy Dave. But none like Linda. I wrote Sunshine Superman knowing she\u2019d hear the lyrics and realise I still loved her. I sang: \u201cIt\u2019ll take time, I know it, but in a while / You\u2019re gonna be mine, I know it / We\u2019ll do it in style.\u201d  Sunshine did come softly through my window the day I wrote it, just like in the lyrics, but \u201csunshine\u201d can also mean LSD. I\u2019d just read The Doors of Perception, Aldous Huxley\u2019s book about taking mescaline, and wanted to get to the invisible fourth dimension of transcendental superconscious vision. I tried LSD, mescaline and finally meditation. At the time, I was great pals with the Beatles. We were all experimenting, nicking sounds from each other. I was getting into baroque music and told my producer, Mickey Most, I wanted harpsichord on the track. \u201cYou need an arranger,\u201d he said, introducing me to John Cameron who understood immediately. \u201cYou want a soundtrack to your poetry,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a movie.\u201d When Mickey heard the result, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve really created something here, Don. Don\u2019t let Paul McCartney hear it.\u201d         Listen to Colours by Donovan    The song was a smash. Four years later, I was renting my old cottage in Hertfordshire out to two American girls. Lorey, one of them, went to a party at Eric Clapton\u2019s house with Linda, who was back from LA. To this day I don\u2019t know if Lorey was setting us up, but she told Linda: \u201cI\u2019m renting a cottage. Want to see it?\u201d I met them when they came round and Lorey said: \u201cOh, do you two know each other?\u201d We were married a few weeks later and have been together ever since. John Cameron, arranger and harpsichordist I pitched up in a flat full of purple drapes and zodiac stars and started talking to Don about the song. Then suddenly Chas Chandler of the Animals burst in, saying he\u2019d found this fantastic guitarist in New York called Jimi Hendrix. And then we just resumed our meeting. Don was up for anything: he didn\u2019t want the classic rock sound, but something different, something jazzier.         Donovan performs Mellow Yellow    So we used classic jazzers: Spike Heatley on double bass, John Paul Jones on bass guitar. Then Mickey added the guitar \u2013 played by Jimmy Page. Mickey was a great producer. He\u2019d go \u201cI like that bit\u201d or \u201cTake that bit out\u201d. He once told me to set out an an arrangement on Velcro. My harpsichord was an enormous old Thomas Morley \u2013 the sort of thing you\u2019d get in the Festival Hall playing Bach. It gave the song a fabulous start.  Sunshine Superman is the sound of 1965, but the British release was actually delayed a year. After we recorded it, I had to go back to conducting panto at Watford Palace theatre. Then, the moment it was a hit, everyone wanted me as their arranger. I was so busy. I had entire string sections tearing round London on motorbikes.  The 2CD anthology Donovan Retrospective is out now on Union Square Music. Donovan plays the London Palladium on 6 May. Tour details: donovan.ie.",
