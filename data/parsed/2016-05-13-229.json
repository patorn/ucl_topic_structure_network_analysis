  "body": "He has become something of a cult figure but time is running out for visitors to catch a glimpse of the police sergeant turned blogger and author known as the Scilly Sergeant.  Colin Taylor was making his headlining appearance at the inaugural Isles of Scilly festival on Friday, giving a much-anticipated talk on his life and times on the weather and wave-beaten archipelago. His book \u2013 The Life of a Scilly Sergeant \u2013 is to be published next month along with a serialisation in a tabloid newspaper. But then Taylor will be preparing to leave his slice of island paradise for the (relatively speaking) big city lights of Exeter in Devon.  Speaking to the Guardian before his festival appearance, Taylor joked that his time on Scilly actually ran out three years ago: \u201cBut I kept my head down and they forgot about me.\u201d  In the first week of August he will be heading for the mainland. \u201cI\u2019m not being pushed, I\u2019m not jumping, it\u2019s just the right time to go,\u201d he said.  Scilly is sometimes called the \u201cland that crime forgot\u201d and jobs Taylor has done include rushing to the aid of a stray seal pup that had found its way on to the high street and resolving a drunken row between two chefs on the relative merits of rock salt and sea salt. This month, his duties have included dealing with a Chinese couple who arrived on Scilly thinking they were 200 miles away in Jersey.  He has had to be on guard against smugglers believing Scilly to be a soft route into the UK, and there are, of course, the usual fights and minor crimes that happen anywhere. Last year, the force was involved when a large chunk of the unmanned US rocket SpaceX Falcon 9 washed up on one of the islands after exploding following take-off in Florida.  \u201cBeing a police officer in a place like Scilly is actually quite onerous,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cYou\u2019re policing the people you live alongside. You\u2019re policing a community. For me it has taken a lot of thinking about. It\u2019s like a spider\u2019s web. When you tug one bit the other end shakes. There\u2019s a lot of unexpected consequences to your actions which perhaps you don\u2019t see in a large city where you\u2019re more anonymous.\u201d  Taylor said the label of Scilly being the land that crime forgot was not helpful. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to gently educate people. It\u2019s more the land that forgot about crime,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have forgotten about it because it doesn\u2019t happen very often but it does happen. When people say what on earth have you got police officers for, I say stuff does happen, we need to be there. It isn\u2019t quite that no-crime zone. Things happen, there are humans that live here.\u201d  Taylor said it was a \u201cbit odd\u201d that his posts had become so popular that he was in demand for festival appearances. \u201cI\u2019m more used to shouting at people and telling them to leave rather than trying to get them to stay and listen to me.\u201d  He said he believed his nickname \u2013 Scilly Sergeant \u2013 had helped his profile. \u201cPeople prick up their ears when they hear that. I\u2019ve found my feet writing, I really enjoy that. I enjoy the process of being read. That spurs me on. I\u2019ve got loads of material to write about. I\u2019m the only person writing about policing in a bizarre location like Scilly.\u201d",
