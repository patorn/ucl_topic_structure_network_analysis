  "body": "A week ago nobody had heard of Duncan Storrar. How he must wish that was still the case. Friday brought fresh humiliation for the 45-year-old father of two. Melbourne\u2019s Herald Sun dredged up his criminal record, including stints in prison for threats to kill and breaching court orders. A day before, the Australian newspaper had sought out Storrar\u2019s estranged son, who spoke of his father\u2019s alleged drug use and absent parenting. And what had warranted such scrutiny of a part-time truck driver from Geelong? Storrar had articulated with disarming clarity how the budget looked from the lowest rungs.

If you lift my tax-free threshold, that changes my life. That means that I get to say to my little girls, \u2018Daddy\u2019s not broke this weekend. We can go to the pictures.\u2019  \u201cRich people don\u2019t even notice their tax-free threshold lift. Why don\u2019t I get it? Why do they get it?\u201d O\u2019Dwyer talked stiffly of \u201cgrowing the pie\u201d, of small business tax cuts allowing cafes to buy new $6,000 toasters. \u201cDuncan, I\u2019ll be harsh in my message,\u201d said another panellist, Innes Wilcox, the head of Australia\u2019s business lobby. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the minimum wage and with a family, you would not pay much tax, if any at all, would you? You would not pay much tax.\u201d The Australian took up the same thread on Tuesday, noting in an otherwise sympathetic piece that Storrar \u2013 who says he has post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of childhood sexual abuse \u2013 fell under the $18,200 threshold to pay income tax, and relied on a $520-a-fortnight welfare payment to survive.

His part in the story could have ended at this point, given way to a broader discussion of inequality in Australia \u2013 persistently increasing over the past decade \u2013 or of the limits of tax and welfare systems in a straitened economic environment.  Instead Storrar himself has become the focus of remarkably savage coverage, branded a \u201cthug\u201d in Melbourne\u2019s Herald Sun and a lousy parent in the Australian. On Friday, the ABC broadcaster Jon Faine grilled Damon Johnston, the Herald Sun editor, about the stories.  \u201cI query your paper\u2019s value system,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s as blunt and profound as that. Twice this week you\u2019ve taken people with obvious mental issues ... people who dare question people in power and positions of authority, and they get ground into dirt. What a way to conduct yourselves.\u201d Johnson shrugged it off. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be on the national stage in the middle of an election campaign, it\u2019s equally legitimate to have your own past looked at, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d Threaded through News Corp stories are similar attempts to justify its coverage. It appears to hang on a tweet from a Q&A producer, Amanda Collinge, who described Storrar on Tuesday as \u201ca new national hero\u201d. \u201cThe ABC presented him as a \u2018new national hero\u2019 and a low-paid Aussie battler, but Duncan \u00adStorrar\u2019s son, Aztec Major, paints a very different picture of his \u00adfather,\u201d the Australian\u2019s Thursday story said. \u201cABC hero to villain,\u201d ran the Herald Sun\u2019s Friday front page.  Four words \u2013 now deleted \u2013 but enough to turn Storrar, like Zaky Mallah before him, into an abstraction, fodder for a culture war between a media empire and the public broadcaster. Storrar is said to be reeling, willing the spotlight to move on. He might take comfort from the Australian\u2019s editorial the day it interviewed his son, that its coverage was not personal, just business. \u201cStorrar is not the issue,\u201d it said. \u201cWe wish him and his family all the best.\u201d",
