  "body": "The BBC\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, has been expelled from North Korea, three days after he was detained in the capital, for showing disrespect, \u201cdistorting facts and realities\u201d and \u201cspeaking ill\u201d of its leader, Kim Jong-un. Wingfield-Hayes was detained in Pyongyang on Friday along with producer Maria Byrne and cameraman Matthew Goddard as they were about to leave North Korea, according to the BBC website.   Related: North Korea will not use nuclear weapons first, says Kim Jong-un    Wingfield-Hayes was not among the dozens of foreign media organisations covering the Workers party\u2019s first congress in 36 years; he had covered an earlier trip of Nobel laureates and had been scheduled to leave on Friday. China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency, which has a bureau in Pyongyang, said the North\u2019s National Peace Committee had held a press conference on Monday saying Wingfield-Hayes had been expelled for \u201cattacking the DPRK system and non-objective reporting\u201d. O Ryong-il, secretary-general of the committee, said the journalist\u2019s news coverage distorted facts and \u201cspoke ill of the system and the leadership of the country\u201d. He said Wingfield-Hayes wrote an apology, was being expelled on Monday and would not be readmitted into the country.    Breaking - Our man in North Korea is detained & questioned for 8 hours. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes & his team to be expelled from the country\u2014 Nick Robinson (@bbcnickrobinson) May 9, 2016    The broadcaster reportedly decided not to report the detention until it became apparent that Wingfield-Hayes and his colleagues would be expelled. The three BBC staff have arrived in Beijing after their government minders brought them to Pyongyang airport. BBC reports said Wingfield-Hayes was questioned for eight hours by North Korean officials and made to sign a statement.           North Korea expels BBC journalist for \u2018distorting facts\u2019    Reports said that North Korean officials were unhappy about Wingfield-Hayes\u2019 coverage of a visit to a children\u2019s hospital in Pyongyang along with Nobel prize laureates. . In the report, which aired last week, Wingfield-Hayes said the patients at the hospital looked \u201cremarkably well, and there isn\u2019t a real doctor in sight\u201d. He added: \u201cEverything we see looks like a set-up.\u201d Another BBC correspondent in Pyongyang, John Sudworth, said in a broadcast report that there was \u201cdisagreement, a concern over the content of Rupert\u2019s reporting\u201d, including questioning the authenticity of the hospital. \u201cWhen he reached the airport on Friday, he was separated from the rest of his team, prevented from boarding that flight, taken to a hotel and interrogated by the security bureau here in Pyongyang before being made to sign a statement and then released, eventually allowed to rejoin us here in this hotel,\u201d Sudworth said. \u201cThey were certainly very shaken,\u201d he said, adding that Wingfield-Hayes had suddenly found himself \u201cunder a huge amount of pressure\u201d. In another report, Wingfield-Hayes, who reported from Russia and China before moving to Japan, said of Kim Jong-un: \u201cWhat exactly he\u2019s done to deserve the title marshal is hard to say. On state TV the young ruler seems to spend a lot of time sitting in a large chair watching artillery firing at mountainsides.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tokyo-based correspondent Will Ripley, who is also in Pyongyang, said references to Kim, who has ruled the state since late 2011, carried risks for international journalists. \u201cObviously this is a very sensitive issue for all journalists who come into North Korea to report, and the North Koreans take very seriously any comments made about their leader,\u201d Ripley told CNN. The BBC\u2019s Stephen Evans, who is still in Pyongyang, said the North Korean leadership was displeased with the broadcaster\u2019s depictions of life in the country\u2019s capital, during which foreign reporters are constantly supervised by government-appointed interpreters. In his first report, Wingfield-Hayes said he was \u201choping for any chance to see North Korea \u2018off script\u2019\u201d. He added that on a previous visit to Pyongyang, \u201cI tried to sneak out to see a bit of Pyongyang street life ... a soldier jumped out of the bushes and ordered me to turn around.\u201d",
