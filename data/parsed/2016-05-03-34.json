  "body": "Even now, after all the money spent, the trophies that have already been stacked up in the years of Abu Dhabi ownership and all the A-grade footballers who have pulled on the club\u2019s colours, there are still moments that must feel new to the modern-day Manchester City. One of them came at Madrid airport when the crowd of photographers waiting for Manuel Pellegini and his players supplied the hard evidence that City have reached a level of competition \u2013 and in some cases, mild hysteria \u2013 they have not experienced before. The scrum was frantic enough for one cameramen to be sent sprawling into the road, enduring a near-trampling in the process, and it all felt very different to the quiet scene in Manchester a few hours earlier when the team boarded their flight without a single television crew in the vicinity and the only clicking coming from Sharon, the club\u2019s photographer.   Related: Zinedine Zidane expects Real Madrid to suffer against Manchester City | Sid Lowe    Perhaps it was a little unfortunate for City that they set off for one of the more important matches of their new era with England\u2019s media more occupied by the story of Leicester City. Yet the prize is still enormous in the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u on Wednesday night and it was certainly a relaxed party arriving in the Spanish capital. The club had deliberately opened up their flight to the players\u2019 wives and children. Six members of the women\u2019s team were there to support everyone. The idea, one City official said, was to provide a united front. They will need the same on the pitch given that Madrid\u2019s aggregate score from their previous five Champions League ties at their own ground is 18-0 and particularly now that it seems Cristiano Ronaldo will be a definite starter. Pellegrini tried to play down Ronaldo\u2019s improvement, trotting out the line that Madrid could never be just a one-man team, but it does make City\u2019s task considerably more treacherous and, if they are to stand any chance, it will need them to put into place everything they have learned during their previous European assignments. On that count, there is at least the feeling \u2013 and it has been a long time coming \u2013 that the team do finally feel at ease in these kind of surroundings. Far too often, the sides put out by Pellegrini, and previously Roberto Mancini, have looked unsure of themselves in this competition. Yet Pellegrini made the point that something had changed with their quarter-final defeat of Paris Saint-Germain. Psychologically, it was a crucial breakthrough. \u201cI think we\u2019ve learned from our mistakes in the past,\u201d their midfielder, Fernandinho, said. \u201cI think this year the team has understood how to play in the Champions League. It was about having a more cohesive team, a more compact team that doesn\u2019t give the opponent as many goalscoring opportunities. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve done something wrong you try not to make the same mistake again, and whatever you\u2019ve done well you try to do again. We\u2019ve had some disappointments, we\u2019ve had some happiness, and you try to take something from everything. You can see the difference from the last two years to this year.\u201d They will need to use all that knowledge if they are to see off the 10-times winners and, more than anything, they may also need Sergio Ag\u00fcero to remind everyone why Pellegrini always says there is no one bar Ronaldo and Lionel Messi who deserves to be thought of as superior footballers. Ag\u00fcero\u2019s failure to register a shot on target in City\u2019s past four Champions League assignments (despite having a penalty in one of those games) certainly feels incongruous to everything the Argentinian has shown in his five seasons at the club. Yet it is an inescapable fact only four of his 23 Premier League goals this season have come against top-eight sides and he has been strangely subdued, particularly in the goalless first leg against Madrid, when they faced opponents of a higher calibre. Ag\u00fcero has one goal in 11 games against Juventus, PSG, Madrid, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Leicester City and Manchester United. He is far too accomplished for Pellegrini to start doubting him but City\u2019s manager did make the point this would be a good time for Ag\u00fcero to blow away even the merest suggestion of flat-track bullying. \u201cI always say the big games are decided by the best technical players,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cI hope we will see Sergio put in a good performance.\u201d Not that City are completely reliant on their leading scorer. The time is long overdue for Jes\u00fas Navas to start showing he can leave a favourable impression on big matches and it feels imperative the fit-again Yaya Tour\u00e9 is at his best if, as expected, he fills in for the injured David Silva. \u201cThe whole team has to play well,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cI always say the best league in the world is the Premier League but the best football is actually in Spain. Sevilla have won the Europa League twice and most of the time a Spanish team is involved in the Champions League final. On that basis, we are going to need a very good performance if we want to reach the final.\u201d",
