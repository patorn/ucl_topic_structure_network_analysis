  "body": "My maternal grandmother was the most important person. Her part of the family owned a big house and a lot of land in Norfolk, while my father \u2013 a parson\u2019s son and an army officer \u2013 and mother were always short of money. But Granny and her big house was always there to rescue us and, as a result, I had the most wonderfully rural childhood. I can\u2019t imagine what being a London child would have been like. Riding and reading came from my grandmother\u2019s side of the family, because my great-grandfather was the master of an Oxford college. Books were knee deep and everybody read all the time.   Related: Alive, Alive Oh! and Other Things That Matter review \u2013 Diana Athill\u2019s joyously knowing memoir    My brother Andrew was two years younger than me and when he, poor boy, was sent off at the age of eight to prep school, our lives diverged. But we were pretty close all our lives. My sister Patience, who I loved dearly, was a lot younger \u2013 five years \u2013 and we despised her for being so young: she was useless! I didn\u2019t go to school until I was 14. We had a series of governesses. We had one very dear, nice one: Ursula. She became almost a member of the family. Ursy was just as good with ponies and dogs and things as my mother was. My family were English country gentlefolk and that class were the smuggest sort of people you could possibly be. Although it was extremely disagreeable to observe, it was comforting to be! Now I\u2019ve only got one cousin left, and she\u2019s 102. My mother was absolutely ignorant about sex \u2013 she married extremely young. She was not in love with the young man who proposed to her and when she married, she found out she disliked having sex with him. In an English way, it was all very much disguised and didn\u2019t spoil our childhood. My father was a nice man, but he was not particularly fond of children. My brother and I used to get irritated when our parents squabbled, so we used a formula learned from my sister\u2019s nanny: \u201cYour parents are both very nice people, but probably they shouldn\u2019t have married each other.\u201d   Related: Diana Athill: \u2018I expected to be shattered at the loss of my baby, and I wasn't'    If something happened that my mother disagreed with, she would behave as if it hadn\u2019t happened. Hypocritical in a way, but effective. By the end of her life, we were very close. She told me my father was not Patience\u2019s father. She never told Patience. So we\u2019ll never know who Patience\u2019s father was. I didn\u2019t tell her about my pregnancy in my 40s [she had a miscarriage] because I knew it would be very distressing for her. Actually, Mother was far more broadminded than she thought she was. Patience\u2019s daughter Jane fell in love with her riding master in [what was] Rhodesia. When she became pregnant at 19, Jane came to London and stayed with me until she had the baby. My mother came for the birth and she and her sisters were all so sweet to Jane. My niece had the baby adopted, which nearly killed her. But years later, her daughter turned up and it was a lovely thing. The younger members of my family realised the playwright Barry Reckford and I were living together. But with the older family, our [mixed-race] relationship was not faced. They solved the problem by referring to Barry as my lodger. Andrew\u2019s four boys, with their children, have become my family. Andrew\u2019s oldest son, Phil, manages all my affairs. He is a saint. It makes up for not having children myself. He has just become a grandfather, and I have to see moving photographs of Arthur Athill at every stage of his life. And I have to watch and admire and say: \u201cGoodness, isn\u2019t he clever?\u201d \u2022 Alive, Alive Oh! And Other Things That Matter by Diana Athill is published by Granta Books, \u00a37.99",
