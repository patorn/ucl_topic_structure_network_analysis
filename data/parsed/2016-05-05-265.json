Jos\u00e9 Mourinho happened to Joe Cole \u2026 anyhow, he\u2019s about to swap Coventry City for the Tampa Bay Rowdies. But remember when he scored his first professional goal for West Ham against Birmingham, and the world was at his feet? He wasn\u2019t too shabby for Chelsea either.

Here\u2019s an interview from 2015 in which he discusses the early use of onboard footage at great length. 3) Grigor Dimitrov in racket-smashing meltdown. There\u2019s more tennis-related tomfoolery here. 4) The perils of sweeper-keeping \u2026 5) SSTTRRIIIIIIIIIIIIKKKKEERRRRRR!
