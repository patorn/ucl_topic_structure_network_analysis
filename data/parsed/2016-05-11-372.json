  "body": "At the bottom of a hill near the frontline with Islamic State fighters, the Iraqi army had been digging in. Their white tents stood near the brown earth gouged by the armoured trucks that had carried them there \u2013 the closest point to Mosul they had reached before an assault on Iraq\u2019s second largest city. For a few days early last month, the offensive looked like it already might be under way. But that soon changed when the Iraqis, trained by US forces, were quickly ousted from al-Nasr, the first town they had seized. There were about 25 more small towns and villages, all occupied by Isis, between them and Mosul. And 60 miles to go.   Related: Green zone protests raise questions over viability of Iraq's government    Behind the Iraqis, the Kurdish peshmerga remained dug into positions near the city of Makhmour that had marked the frontline since not long after Mosul was seized in June 2014. The war had been theirs until the national army arrived. The new partnership is not going well. On both sides, there is a belief that what happens on the road to Mosul will not only define the course of the war but also shape the future of Iraq. And, despite the high stakes, planning for how to take things from here is increasingly clouded by suspicion and enmity. Two years after the Isis onslaught, the country remains crippled by ethnic and sectarian strife and political torpor, which have withered state control and pitched the Iraqi army in a power struggle with militias and the Kurds before it even faces off with Isis. The result has been a stalemate in the battle that matters most, with Iraq deeply wary that the largely autonomous Kurdish north will use its involvement to formalise a divorce from Baghdad \u2013 and the Kurds just as sceptical that Iraq\u2019s military is up for the fight. \u201cThere is no such thing as Iraq any more,\u201d said Capt Shawqat of the Kurdish peshmerga, behind sandbags about a mile away from the Iraqi lines. \u201cThere never was, but now it is clear to everyone. Even to the Americans up in the hills.\u201d   Graphic: areas of control in Iraq   Next to him, another Kurdish officer, Lt Col Srud Barzinji, looked through his binoculars at the Iraqi troops. \u201cLook at them,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery military training course tells us that you must have at least 500 metres of open land between yourself and your enemy. They are at the bottom of a hill, just below them. They have no element of surprise.\u201d Until mid-March Iraqi forces had stayed away, their most loyal units retrained by the US in Anbar province before being sent back to Makhmour. \u201cWhen they attacked al-Nasr, the Americans were firing artillery from the mountain [about 30 miles behind],\u201d said Barzinji. \u201cThey were very precise shells, guided in by cameras, and they still couldn\u2019t take it. They fled after a few hours.\u201d The Makhmour frontline stretches over 75 miles to the south-east of Mosul, and is seen by military leaders on all sides as the best way to reach Iraq\u2019s second largest city, which is still thought to be home to up to 600,000 people. The towns and villages in between have all been seized by Isis \u2013 a mixture of homegrown militants and fighters from abroad. Isis banners fly from phone towers or other high points in each village, and the jihadis are proving hard to oust. Many captured Isis members had been carrying weapons they had seized from the Iraqi military when 80,000 to 100,000 of its soldiers and officers fled two years ago, surrendering the area to the terror group.

They move around at night: they have dug tunnels, and they have laid bombs. All around us were bombs when we came into this village. It will be like this all the way to Mosul. Our friends can\u2019t do this by themselves, and they know that,\u201d he said, referring to the Iraqi army. \u201cThe difference is, we believe in what we are fighting for. We believe in this cause. We have principles and we have values. We will not stop until we get this done.\u201d Iraqi forces did advance on Monday, retaking the village of Kabarouk in the Makhmour area, the first success since being pushed back from al-Nasr. Up to 300 villagers walked out of the village towards Kurdish forces where they were sent to a holding centre. \u201cThe ones we think are Isis, we will send straight to Irbil,\u201d said Barzinji, as he stood surrounded by refugees from elsewhere in Iraq last week. \u201cMost of them, like these people, were caught up in it. But we need to check them out.\u201d Out of the crowd emerged two young men in their early 20s. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it is like in there,\u201d said one 22-year old-who had walked to Makhmour from near Mosul. \u201cIt is so confused. My father is in Isis. He joined them because he has three wives and he could not afford to pay for them all,\u201d the man said, adding that his father had joined the terror group to benefit from the stipend it pays its members. \u201cIt was financial for him, but it made our life hell.\u201d A second man, Issam, 22, said his brother had joined the terror group and had tried to recruit him. \u201cI said no and he did not force me, but he became ideological. Communities are very tired. They are ruthless. If they catch you smoking once, they will warn you,\u201d he said inhaling a cigarette. \u201cIf they catch you a second time, you get the leather,\u201d he added, lifting his shirt to show faint scars. Further along the frontline were villages that had been seized from Isis and were now being used as staging areas by Iraqi forces. Barzinji predicted the push for Mosul would not happen this year. \u201cWe are military officers and we don\u2019t speak poorly of our colleagues. But look at what\u2019s been achieved. And look at the job ahead.\u201d Additional reporting by Salem Rezk",
