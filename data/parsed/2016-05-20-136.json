  "body": "It\u2019s been known for some time that people share things on social media \u2013 a lot \u2013 without reading them first. The writer Alex Balk recently compared Facebook to \u201cthe coffee table on which people placed their unread copies of Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital\u201d: when we share, we\u2019re often really focused on promoting a certain image. But a new study goes further: apparently, sharing things, or just having the option to share, undermines the ability to digest and remember them. (Participants were twice as likely to make errors in a comprehension test.) When your attention is partly occupied by thoughts of how you\u2019ll share or discuss what you\u2019re reading, it\u2019s a distraction from actually reading it \u2013 made worse, presumably, if your newsfeed\u2019s also scrolling by in the corner of your eye. Social media is like belonging to a book club, but only ever reading novels while you\u2019re at the book club, two glasses of cabernet the worse for wear. The only surprise is that any of this comes as a\u00a0surprise. It should be obvious that attention is a\u00a0limited resource (that\u2019s why people crash when they text and drive) yet we rarely treat it like other such resources. If a major corporation took \u00a310 from your bank account daily, for no benefit, you\u2019d be furious. But as Matthew Crawford points out in his book The World Beyond Your Head, the same corporation can help itself to your attention with a loud TV ad in an airport lounge, dragging your focus from conversation. Indeed, we actively collaborate with attention theft: iPads that let you jump from your novel to the web or to FaceTime chat are more popular than e-readers that won\u2019t. In a culture that viewed attention differently, we\u00a0might pay extra for such limitations. Instead, we act as if our attentional capacities are infinite, then feel scattered and exhausted when it turns out they aren\u2019t. You can deal with the situation by denying there\u2019s a problem, as some pundits like to do; or you can take draconian measures, quitting social media for ever, or going on digital detox retreats. But I prefer the middle path encapsulated in the Buddhist idea of \u201cguarding the sense doors\u201d. The\u00a0world stakes its claims on our attention, this argument goes, through the \u201csense doors\u201d, chiefly the eyes and ears. So it\u2019s wise to employ a doorman. (I imagine a firm but polite butler, not a bouncer on steroids.) You don\u2019t need to nail the door completely shut, as Facebook quitters do; you just need to stay mindful of who\u2019s trying to get in.   Related: Don\u2019t think you\u2019re lucky? Think again | Oliver Burkeman    In practical terms, this means not mixing attentional modes: read when you\u2019re reading, share when you\u2019re sharing. You could send articles you discover online to Instapaper or Evernote, read them later offline, then treat sharing as a discrete task, perhaps at a specific time. This may not mean always being narrowly focused on one task; plenty of social situations need \u201cwide-angle\u201d attention instead. But it does mean not trying to use attention simultaneously for two incompatible tasks. Let one visitor across the threshold at a\u00a0time. The others will wait on the doorstep. Or,\u00a0better yet, wander off and stop pestering you. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com",
