  "body": "Eli Roth presides as exec producer over this fantastically pointless and uninspired horror remake of his 2002 scary movie about the attractive young people who go away for a weekend break in a cabin in the woods, have sex and then succumb to a flesh-eating virus, while at the same time being menaced by creepy hillbilly locals.  There is no interesting new slant on this material: it\u2019s just the same old stuff, being served up in a tired and cynical fashion, without anything inventive in the way of humour or fear. And the sting that comes midway through the closing credits takes the film to a new level of lameness and dullness. One to avoid.",
