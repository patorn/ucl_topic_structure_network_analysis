Michiru used to be a model but now prefers life behind the camera and has, for the past five years, worked with her husband \u2013 a wig specialist in the film industry \u2013 offering this makeover service. We were the first foreign men to try it out.       The cafe (actually two apartments) is in the Tokyo suburb of Morishita and people come here to experience what it\u2019s like to be a geisha (or a samurai) and get a feel for traditional Japan. Most dress up for a photo souvenir, while others are honeymooners who want to dress up in traditional Japanese wedding outfits. The cafe does not offer a rental service; the outfits stay in the building, and Michiru explained that she is keen not to promote male geisha transformation as some sort a joke. She had one Japanese man who wanted to dress up like a geisha, with a moustache, as part of a \u201cfunny\u201d TV broadcast. The cafe declined the offer.     Man in the mirror \u2026 Sebastien takes a selfie during makeover preparations.    The experience is an education on geisha daily life. Tradition is everywhere, whether it\u2019s the way wigs are styled or the vivid whiteness of the makeup. Michiru was on hand to answer our questions about culture: such as why geisha pose with a pout or serious expression (to avoid baring their teeth) or flash a little red from the undergarment (a coy way to titillate). There\u2019s so much detail involved at every stage of dressing up as a geisha that you only begin to appreciate it once you transform into one.     Best feet forward \u2026 tabi socks divide the toes into two sections    The process, which took around three hours, including the photoshoot, began with us undressing down to our trousers and putting on the white hada-juban undergarment. We also put on the geisha tabi socks, which divide your toes into two: one space for the big toe and the other for the remaining toes. This optimises the feet for walking in the high wooden okobo shoes, worn outside to prevent the kimonos from touching the ground.     The Nomadic Boys at the end of their three-hour makeover experience in full makeup and dress.    Geisha are instantly recognisable by their elaborate shironuri (white) makeup. This is a white paste, traditionally applied to showcase a young, beautiful face in the dark candlelit rooms before electricity was invented. As part of the application, several layers of foundation were applied to hide our beard shadow.  In addition, our eyebrows had to be hidden using a special wax and new ones painted over. This was the most surprising part of the experience as we watched our faces transform from the features we\u2019re so used to, into this new, more feminine impression. Finally, the wigs: geisha wigs are based on the shimada hairstyle where the hair is gathered together at the crown of the head and a portion of the bun sectioned off to point outward. The hairstyle developed during the Edo period (1603-1868) as a popular fashion among merchants\u2019 wives. Once our kimonos were fitted, we perfected our pouts and were ready for the full-length mirror. We do like to dress up once in a while. We did an excellent drag dress up for London Pride and a less glamorous dress up for one Halloween when we transformed into The Hairy Sisters\u2026 But the geisha transformation was the most professional one we\u2019ve done. The makeup is so intense that the image staring back is almost unrecognisable. As the photoshoot progressed, Michiru, who was apprehensive towards us at first, started to open up. We\u2019ll never forget her enthusiasm as she rushed to adjust where the kimono was placed between each shot, and then her crying out, \u201cGorgeous!
