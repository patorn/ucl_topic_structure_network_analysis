  "body": "The feeling of despair that descends on hearing the theme tune of the CBeebies television show Me Too! is unmistakable. At 6am, it is the first show on the schedule of the BBC\u2019s dedicated channel for the under-sixes, and if you find yourself watching it, a series of bleak assumptions can be made. First, you\u2019re up too early. Second, you\u2019ve capitulated, turning on the TV in the hope of silencing your offspring and going back to sleep. Third, even if you do manage to lose consciousness again, your doze will be infiltrated by the sounds of Me Too! \u2013 chuckles, saxophones, catchphrases. The theme tune alone, a jaunty bit of jazz-rock in a call-and-response format, can induce a mental state that, on a winter morning when the sun will not rise for another two hours, is doomy and tinged with moral collapse. Some comfort can be drawn from the fact that the show is on CBeebies. If a show is on CBeebies, it\u2019s legit. It is like seeing the Fair Trade symbol, or a British flag on a punnet of strawberries. You feel righteous, as if you are complying with some fundamental parental code drawn up by the BBC. You are in the system, safe from the unregulated badlands of Nickelodeon and its oceans of advertising, the looping hours of Peppa Pig and American imports that run through the night so that other, feral children (not yours) can watch cartoons at 2am while snuffling from bowls of refined sugar. When you hear the squawk of trumpet that launches Me Too!, you can console yourself that in the eyes of the BBC the day has officially begun, and you can now surrender yourself to the green, health-and-safety, one-eye-on-the-curriculum world of CBeebies. I can\u2019t remember the precise moment CBeebies entered my life. The kid came two-and-a-half years ago, and I dutifully established all sorts of lofty principles about the limited role TV would play in her childhood. Ha. Then, maybe a year in, a friend recommended a show that had the ability to hold her toddler in a peaceful trance \u2013 a notion that had begun to seem massively appealing. Thus a world was unveiled, a parallel universe of cartoon robots, consistently euphoric presenters, and Peter Rabbit as you have never seen him. A world where each hour of the day was accounted for, and where children reign supreme. This was not just a channel, but a culture. There was no going back. Any parent knows that children\u2019s TV has an unparalleled capacity to irritate. But Me Too! Oh, Me Too! is particularly disheartening. The live-action show takes place in Riverseafingal, a fictional Scottish town that, as you swoop through its partially CGI streets in the opening sequence, both strongly resembles Newcastle and contains a replica of the Gherkin. Each episode begins with a parent \u2013 Bobby the night-time bus cleaner, Rudi the stallholder, and so on \u2013 dropping a child off with the unerringly cheerful Granny Murray who always offers them some mysterious kernel of wisdom. (\u201cWhen things get scary, think of something funny,\u201d for example.) The parent then goes to work, gets into some kind of minor scrape \u2013 Rudi\u2019s plastic bags fly away in the wind, Bobby is scared by some thunder \u2013 remembers Granny Murray\u2019s strangely prescient advice, uses it to great personal effect, and then goes back to pick up their kid and congratulate Granny Murray for saving the day. Granny Murray always saves the day.   Related: The clean, green and slightly bonkers world of CBeebies    You could argue that the programme offers a realistic picture of the challenges of balancing work and child-rearing. (The theme tune alone seems to address the pressures of modern capitalism: \u201cEverybody\u2019s busy selling / I want to buy me something new.\u201d) But it is exhaustingly chirpy, and has some baffling preoccupations. The characters are all completely obsessed with time, for example. \u201cI\u2019m in in in in in a hurry!\u201d goes one song, and in every show, you are forced to rewatch an edited version of everything you have just seen, in order to try and help the parent work out where the time has gone \u2013 a question they ask themselves repeatedly and never seem able to answer. I think they are trying to teach children how to tell the time, but it comes across \u2013 at 6am \u2013 as a kind of unsolvable existential crisis. Of course, it\u2019s not meant for me. Kids\u2019 shows repeat things \u2013 \u201cAgain, again!\u201d cry the Teletubbies \u2013 because that\u2019s how kids learn. And CBeebies is all about learning. Its remit, as described in the channel\u2019s service licence, is \u201cto offer high-quality, mostly UK-produced programmes to educate and entertain the BBC\u2019s youngest audience\u201d. Note that education comes first. As for the chirpiness: the characters smile relentlessly because that is nice for the watching child. It is only the cynical adult sitting next to them who notices the slow death taking place behind an actor\u2019s eyes, the disappearing dream of a part in Game of Thrones, the sense \u2013 crystallised in that ferocious grin \u2013 of some profound psychic break taking place.    If a show is on CBeebies, it\u2019s legit. It is like seeing the Fair Trade symbol on a punnet of strawberries    In all this, Me Too! is entirely innocent. It is not the show\u2019s fault that it inhabits the CBeebies equivalent of the graveyard slot. Nor is it unusual in having an atmosphere of unflagging glee. You don\u2019t watch children\u2019s TV for irony. But at the same time it is hard, while watching, to turn off the part of your brain accustomed to tearing things to shreds. The newish parent, who never foresaw the period in their life when they would be spending the hours before dawn watching a woman named Bobby mop a bus depot in the middle of the night, finds themselves picking apart plot, character, meaning, production values. You find yourself wondering \u2013 at some length \u2013 how Bobby actually manages if she is looking after her son all day and then going off to clean buses at night. No wonder she is scared of the thunder! She must be knackered. CBeebies, you see, has become part of your life. * * * When rumours began to circulate last year that the BBC was threatening to axe CBeebies and move all children\u2019s content online, the uproar was predictable and cacophonous. A petition was mounted on Change.org and signed by over 130,000 fraught parents. Parents\u2019 websites such as Netmums succumbed to panic: \u201cLife without CBeebies? That\u2019s just not even worth thinking about, is it?\u201d Blogs were written: \u201cIn some deep, profound, sleep-deprived way, each of us is CBeebies. Please, BBC, do not take it away\u201d (New Statesman). Not everyone is a fan, though. There is, it seems, a political divide in CBeebies appreciation, judging by a recent Spectator article entitled \u201cAgitprop for Toddlers\u201d in which the author compared a wildlife programme on the channel, in which \u201ca rainbow nation of children [march] around the British countryside singing \u2018Let\u2019s make sure we recycle every day\u2019\u201d, to \u201cone of those Dear Leader dirges you see in North Korea\u201d. The outcry and ensuing campaign was ultimately victorious \u2013 last September, the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, confirmed to the Culture, Media and Sport select committee that he had no intention of scrapping the channel. BBC3, meanwhile, sank without a fight \u2013 not having in its back pocket an army of supporters for whom it represented far more than simply television, but a presence that has embedded itself in their home.     \u2018In the Night Garden exerts a kind of supernatural force that can soften even the most jaded of adult viewers\u2019. Photograph: BBC/Ragdoll    You could, if you wanted, structure your whole day by CBeebies. Its content is divided into sections, or \u201czones\u201d according to the CBeebies Style Guide, a 34-page document from the BBC commissioning department, intended for programme-makers and channel staff: Get Set Go! between 6am and 9am, Discover and Do, from 9am to 3.30pm, including Lunch Time at 12, Big Fun Time, from 3.30pm to 6pm, and then the Bedtime Hour from 6 to 7pm. \u201cWith zones,\u201d explains the guide, \u201ceveryone knows where they are, including parents\u201d. It is surely the most literal version of the nanny state, telling you when to craft and when to sleep. Though the timetable does not suit everyone: \u201cI DON\u2019T WANT TO FEED THEM LUNCH AT 12 ON THE DOT EVERY DAY!!\u201d declared Ladymoods on the parenting forum Mumsnet, \u201cSTOP TELLING US WHEN TO DO STUFF!!\u201d CBeebies thinks like a toddler: it likes clarity and consistency, the comfort of routine. Its brand is typified by a font that I can only describe as the printed equivalent of jelly (its official name is Melt). The idents that appear between shows are populated by a collection of animated yellow \u201cbugs\u201d that squeak and wobble. \u201cThe bugs have real personalities but they are not characters \u2013 they are the CBeebies brand come to life,\u201d announces the style guide. And then there are the presenters, a tribe of health-exuding young men and women in citrus-coloured T-shirts who are required to offer bite-size entertainment between shows. They chuck balls to each other, play hide and seek, or sometimes, if their imagination fails them, just tell you what\u2019s coming next in a very, very excited voice.    CBeebies' brand is typified by a font that I can only describe as the printed equivalent of jelly    The presenters provoke intense online debate. On Mumsnet, there are long threads comparing their skills and physical virtues. The day that long-time presenter Andy wore a rather tight-fitting space suit to present the birthday card segment is still fondly remembered. (\u201cIt was a little snug!\u201d wrote Elsqueak. \u201cWhere to look!\u201d) Once, at London Zoo, I happened to see Andy in the flesh performing in an animal-themed show to a packed tent of toddlers and their parents, and inevitably the grown-ups seemed far more starstruck than the kids who were just as entertained by the guy in a gorilla suit. Every now and then I\u2019d see a mum point at the stage and say to their kid, but really to themselves: \u201cLook! It\u2019s Andy!\u201d * * * Naturally, CBeebies has spread far beyond the small screen. There\u2019s an app, a radio version, live shows, and even, since 2014, CBeebies Land at Alton Towers. The day we went, it was bitterly cold and there was still a good half-hour wait for the Octonauts rollercoaster and the Postman Pat van ride. The Hey Duggee interactive show was the principal draw, it seemed, for the crowd, who queued patiently with shivering children for a picture with Duggee himself, in this case a human in a massive dog suit. The queue was heavily patrolled, lest Duggee\u2019s time was overly absorbed by his eager fans and he missed his next show. Such is the life of the CBeebies celebrity. Our patience lasted long enough for one ride, the Treetop Adventure, which involved getting in a car and going round a track about 20ft off the ground. Pretty fun. It gave a good aerial view of the place: the fake trees, the sign forbidding adults from entering the photo tent without a child, the costumed staff. Everyone who did not look like they were suffering from frostbite seemed to be having a blast. Since it launched in 2002, the channel has gradually colonised the globe. Its international version, marketed by BBC Worldwide, is now shown in 78 countries \u2013 from Mozambique to South Korea. Recently, it became the first TV channel to be recognised by the Mexican Paediatric Association for its role in the education and development of children. The BBC estimates it is watched by 1.9 million kids under the age of six in Britain alone. The budget is small \u2013 \u00a328.3m for 2016-17 \u2013 because CBeebies only makes around half its programmes. For the rest, it commissions and \u201cpre-buys\u201d shows from independent production companies: this is a more economical way for the channel to get what it wants, because it invests in a show before it is made, puts its cash in alongside other international investors, then gets a show tailored to its audience that it has not had to fully fund. The commissioners have a long history of picking winners, too. Teletubbies, first shown on the BBC in 1997, is probably the most successful children\u2019s TV show of all time. It has aired in 120 countries and been watched by an estimated one billion children, 300 million of them in China, where it was the first western pre-school TV show to be broadcast. And now it\u2019s back \u2013 a revamped version launched on CBeebies last year, in which the reincarnated Teletubbies seem remarkably similar to the old ones, although now with access to a giant smartphone.     Hey Duggee is also part of the interactive show at CBeebies Land at Alton Towers. Photograph: BBC    There is of course, a downside to such success \u2013 just like Hollywood with its churn of superheroes, there is a certain creative reliance on the back catalogue. Even the Teletubbies\u2019 creator, Anne Wood \u2013 the Steven Spielberg of children\u2019s TV \u2013 told the Radio Times she was \u201ca bit sad\u201d about the remake. \u201cIt comes down to the times we\u2019re in: people feel safer remaking hits of the past rather than investing in something new.\u201d Postman Pat\u2019s new image is a classic of its kind, a shiny upgrade that retains reassuring key features, such as Jess the cat. I watched an original from 1981 and almost keeled over at the glacial pace and low-stakes plot. Pat\u2019s main task for the 15-minute episode was finding the lost doll of a little girl named Katie. He stopped in at various locations in the village to conduct his search. At the church with Reverend Timms he found a lost glove under a pew, and then, at Ted\u2019s workshop, Ted \u201cfound a watch he\u2019d forgotten he\u2019d had\u201d. At the episode\u2019s denouement, Pat discovers Katie\u2019s doll behind a box of chocolates \u2013 it was there the whole time! New Pat would laugh in the face of such twists. There is no sign of the balding Reverend Timms, and now Pat has a mobile phone, regular if perplexing use of a helicopter, and is constantly in the grip of some unfolding emergency that is usually the result of a potentially dangerous object falling out of the back of his van \u2013 a hive of bees, for example. In one recent episode, Pat had to perform a near-lethal aerial display in front of the whole town, whizzing underneath a bridge in a supercharged flying machine. So much for the lost doll. Of course, even CBeebies has to move with the times. When a three-year-old can competently locate inappropriate music videos on an iPad, a scheduled TV channel \u2013 an old-fashioned notion in itself \u2013 has to offer up some pretty jazzy stuff to compete. Give Pat gizmos! Get the helicopter out to find the missing package! At least they\u2019ve kept the song: \u201cEarly in the morning / Just when day is dawning / Pat feels he\u2019s a really happy man.\u201d Except there\u2019s something about that \u201cfeels\u201d that makes you question Pat\u2019s sanity. Daily, he loses letters, parcels, bee hives. Pat is fantastically inept at his job. Sure, the guy feels happy, but he\u2019s hopeless.     The shiny new Postman Pat and his helicopter. Photograph: supplied    * * * I don\u2019t know if everyone has the same guilt about kids and television. I have friends who grew up watching as much as they wanted (loads), and then there are the ones who were strictly rationed, half an hour a day, only Newsround or Blue Peter, never ITV. I was in the latter camp until secondary school when my mum took on some extra teaching work in the evenings and I had blissful, uninterrupted hours ploughing through the Neighbours-Home and Away-Blossom-Wonder Years-My So-Called Life-Party of Five repertoire. But that was later. The early years were heavily policed and television in the morning was indicative of profound systemic breakdown. Now, as I thwack on the TV to buy myself half an hour, or distract the kid while I cut her toenails, I can\u2019t help feeling a sort of internal tug, as though some vital societal fabric is being unravelled because there are images moving across a screen in the living room before lunch. From the first BBC broadcast aimed at children \u2013 Watch with Mother, which aired in July 1950 \u2013 people fretted about the effect that watching television would have on the young, and society as a whole. Some concerns were practical \u2013 according to David Oswell in his book Television, Childhood and the Home, the BBC issued advice to children in 1954 not to watch TV while lying on the floor with their chins cupped in their hands, as this was liable \u201cto make their faces misshapen\u201d. Others were profoundly moral. \u201cWhat might our children become?\u201d wrote Monica Dickens in Woman\u2019s Own in 1950, \u201cThey might become a generation who couldn\u2019t read a book, or play games out of doors, or amuse themselves with carpentry or trains or butterflies, or the hundreds of hobbies with which a child potters so happily.\u201d Something of this panic persists today when, for example, a friend comes round and you explain, full of embarrassment, that the television is only being turned on so you can actually have a conversation. There is a sense that you have failed a little, having not come up with some more constructive diversion, such as making a hovercraft out of sticks, or, more fundamentally, not having created a child who will happily do puzzles in absorbed silence for prolonged periods of time. CBeebies seems to know about that guilt, and, with one eye on the parent, seeks to assuage it. So there are songs, interludes between the programmes, to remind the viewing child that a world exists beyond their sofa. \u201cEveryone get out and about / So much to do outside!\u201d went one recently. Kids steamed past on scooters, ran around in fields, scampered through a forest, all red-cheeked and brazenly healthy. And there is endless craft in the old Blue Peter style \u2013 demonstrations by presenters of how to make a planet out of bits of cardboard. All this is as old as the medium. I saw a Watch with Mother from 1963 the other day, and the presenter \u2013 a beautifully formal lady, with hair like a bold and immovable granite sculpture around her head and an accent that died with the empire \u2013 sat behind a table in front of some floral curtains and spent an unfeasibly long time showing her audience how to make paper lanterns, while being distracted by a wooden puppet dog called Sausage. \u201cThe paper must be the right shape,\u201d she instructed seriously. \u201cAn oblong.\u201d The craft displays and montages of children foraging are all laudable, but they somehow become a form of mockery when confronted with your child\u2019s catatonic passivity as they stare at the screen. When a kid is watching another kid in a forest on TV, they are very obviously not in a forest. And, let\u2019s be honest, no kid is going to watch another kid in a forest and say: \u201cI want to go to a forest.\u201d They\u2019re going to say, \u201cCan I watch another Mike the Knight?\u201d And you, the parent, have turned on the TV precisely to avoid having to go to a forest, or because you have just come back from the playground and are really tired. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t like forests \u2013 you love them! And on your occasional forest visits you take a lot of pictures to remind yourself that your kid\u2019s childhood is definitely idyllic. But, the point is that watching your child watching another child run through a forest serves only to remind you that right now your own child is doing the exact opposite.     The Clangers come on at the end of the CBeebies day, narrated by the steady, lulling voice of Michael Palin. Photograph: Production/BBC    * * * The end of the day, as declared by CBeebies, is at 7pm. The channel simply stops, the way channels used to in the distant, analogue past. The \u201cbedtime hour\u201d concludes with a bedtime story, often read by a famous actor \u2013 Damian Lewis, Rosamund Pike, David Hasselhoff \u2013 who seem genuinely delighted about their five minutes of airtime on kids\u2019 TV. The narrating celebrity presence on CBeebies is a constant: Alexander Armstrong (Hey Duggee), Derek Jacobi (In the Night Garden), Lorraine Kelly (Raa-Raa the Noisy Lion). The other day I watched Bing, about a large-eyed, hapless toddler rabbit, and spent the entire episode trying to identify the lyrical voice of his little brown-bear carer called Flop. Finally, the credits rolled: Academy Award-winner Mark Rylance! For some, the bedtime hour is a taunt \u2013 by that time, a kid may only be getting into his stride. For others, it is essential to sanity. When they altered the bedtime hour\u2019s programme line-up last year, the CBeebies schedule manager wrote a long post on the CBeebies Grown-ups website to gently prepare parents for the transformation. \u201cWe don\u2019t make these changes lightly,\u201d he wrote, nervously. The response was dramatic. \u201cPlease reconsider,\u201d pleaded one commenter. \u201cMy children were hysterical!!!\u201d wrote another.   Related: Night fever: How In The Night Garden became a TV fairytale    But in fact, something rather wonderful takes place in this final portion of the day. The pace slows, there are fewer multicoloured dinosaurs, and instead, you have the steady, lulling voice of Michael Palin narrating Clangers \u2013 about a family of pink, mouse-like creatures who live underground on another planet \u2013 followed by the unchanged, vital staple of In the Night Garden. This show, this show. First broadcast in 2007, its 100 episodes \u2013 the final series aired in 2009 \u2013 are constantly repeated on CBeebies. And they are bonkers, involving a psychedelic cast of Iggle Piggle and Upsy-Daisy and Makka Pakka and the rest, all bobbling around in a surrealist garden, dancing and hugging, hanging out in a magical gazebo and travelling in their flying vessels, the Ninky Nonk and the Pinky Ponk. In the Night Garden exerts a kind of supernatural force that can soften even the most jaded of adult viewers. My mum, after four kids, eight grandchildren, and a strong history of anti-TV bias, still talks fondly of Iggle Piggle. Rounds of Reddit theories persist about whether the whole show is actually Iggle Piggle\u2019s dreamworld, or if his voyage across the ocean in a boat is analogous to death. At the end of each episode, the characters fall asleep one by one, Iggle Piggle the last to go, drifting away in his boat to a theme tune which is the perfect counterpoint to that of Me Too! \u2013 elegiac, melodic, free from lyrics about shopping. By the end, the kid is watching in a transported state of wonder and joy I used to think only class\u2011A drugs could induce.     Sarah & Duck. Photograph: Karrot Entertainment    Watching a child watch In the Night Garden makes sense of things a bit. The kid loves TV for precisely the reasons I love TV. Pleasure, relaxation, stories. She falls, just like I do, for characters, for worlds. It is a way of escaping, maybe expanding, or at least releasing yourself to someone else\u2019s imagination for a while. I don\u2019t feel guilty about watching it, so it would be pointlessly hypocritical to feel guilty about her watching it. My favourite show on CBeebies \u2013 words I never thought I\u2019d write \u2013 isn\u2019t In the Night Garden, though. It\u2019s Sarah & Duck, a series of seven-minute animations about a beanie-wearing girl called Sarah and her duck, called Duck. Sarah is busy, a little officious, kind; Duck, puffed up and absurd, always trying to do things beyond his natural limitations as a waterfowl. They go to the park, to the shop, to the zoo. It\u2019s all fairly low-key, except there is usually some otherworldly element \u2013 a friendly moon or a knitted house or a row of talking shallots \u2013 that nudged the limited action on a bit. An episode might involve Sarah having a cold, or Duck pretending to be a penguin. We\u2019re not talking high drama. But it seems, miraculously, to appeal to the kid and me in equal measure. I think, for me at least, it\u2019s the humour \u2013 quietly visual, where a joke might be the way Duck ravishes a slice of bread \u2013 and the way its tone avoids the usual force-feed of bonhomie. Or maybe it\u2019s just the genial narrating voice of Roger Allam, who never sounds like he is talking to a child. When I watch a good episode \u2013 Beach Break, for example \u2013 in which Duck attempts to eat a strawberry ice\u2011cream, spills it in the sand, narrows his eyes murderously, and then face-plants in both sand and ice cream to try and salvage its remains, I think of the animators. Their work \u2013 probably spending the best part of a week at a computer manipulating the facial expression of a cartoon duck for the sake of four seconds of my kid\u2019s, sorry, my viewing pleasure \u2013 is nothing short of heroic. They have made a world, and I have fallen for it. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.  This article was amended on 5 May 2016.
