  "body": "Given that Olivier Giroud ended the season with a storming hat-trick\u00a0against former European champions Aston Villa, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger could be\u00a0forgiven for wondering whether Arsenal really need to sign a new striker.\u00a0It\u2019s so much hassle. Such a palaver. Does he really need that stress? All\u00a0that time and all that effort, is it really worth it when you\u2019ve got a\u00a0perfectly good Olivier Giroud just waiting to develop into the world\u2019s\u00a0greatest striker at the highly promising age of 29? You have to keep the\u00a0faith. Let Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain fight it out for Juventus\u00a0hotshot\u00a0\u00c1lvaro\u00a0Morata.   Related: Louis van Gaal says Manchester United deserve first trophy of post-Fergie era    And who do they really have to buy Granit Xhaka now that Jack Wilshere is\u00a0back to full fitness? Wenger doesn\u2019t seem convinced. With Borussia\u00a0M\u00f6nchengladbach\u00a0expecting a \u00a335m offer for their Swiss midfielder, they\u00a0were taken aback to see Arsenal, ever the crack negotiators, start the\u00a0bidding at \u00a319m. It\u2019s left them perplexed \u2013 and they won\u2019t know what\u2019s hit\u00a0them when Arsenal up their bid by \u00a31.\u00a0 You can be too clever. Which brings us to the news that the impending\u00a0arrival of Jose Mourinho as Manchester United\u2019s new manager will not be the\u00a0end for Louis van Gaal, who will simply move upstairs and take up as a new\u00a0role of director of sticking his nose where it\u2019s not wanted. Such as when\u00a0he\u2019ll peer into Ed Woodward\u2019s office and demand his desk. J\u00fcrgen\u00a0Klopp has had enough of Simon Mignolet and Alberto Moreno, whose\u00a0last major contribution in a Liverpool shirt is likely to be his cackhanded\u00a0attempt to stop Mariano\u2019s raid down the right in the buildup to Sevilla\u2019s\u00a0equaliser in their Europa League victory on Friday night. The Spanish\u00a0left-back will be replaced by Leicester City\u2019s Ben Chilwell \u2013 you can\u2019t go\u00a0wrong with Leicester \u2013 while Mignolet\u2019s place will be under threat when\u00a0Liverpool sign Mainz goalkeeper Loris Karius. Christian Benteke will also\u00a0be out the door once he\u2019s held make-or-break talks with Klopp, with the\u00a0emphasis on break, and his departure could allow Liverpool to go for\u00a0Fiorentina forward Josip Ilicic.\u00a0West Ham United are still interested in the Belgian striker, having seen\u00a0their bid for Lyon\u2019s Alexandre Lacazette knocked back, but they\u2019ve not\u00a0given up hope of signing Jamie Vardy from Leicester.\u00a0 And finally, Chelsea are closing in on Roma defender Antonio\u00a0R\u00fcdiger,\u00a0Southampton plan to splash \u00a310m on Anderlecht\u2019s Dennis Praet, Tottenham\u00a0Hotspur want Palermo midfielder Franco\u00a0V\u00e1zquez\u00a0and you\u2019d be mad to miss the\u00a0Old Firm derby next season now that it\u2019s emerged that Rangers want to sign\u00a0Burnley\u2019s Joey Barton.",
