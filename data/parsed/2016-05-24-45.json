On 23 June, we face a choice: to cast ourselves adrift, condemning ourselves to irrelevance and Europe to division and weakness; or to reaffirm our commitment to the EU and stiffen the cohesion of our continent in a dangerous world.Professor Simon Schama, Professor Ian Kershaw, Professor Niall Ferguson, Dr Juliet Gardiner, DR Thorpe, Professor David Runciman, Richard Davenport-Hines, Professor

No one should ever knowingly gamble with people\u2019s working lives. For those who pay the price are not politicians in Westminster but millions for whom the loss of their job can be catastrophic. Thirty-five years ago this month, 500 unemployed workers from all walks of life marched from Liverpool to London. They included a mother and son from Whaley Bridge, he out of work, she desperate for the son she loved to find work. The great People\u2019s March for Jobs caught the public imagination. I was proud to be one of the three organisers. A quarter of a million greeted them as heroes as they marched into Trafalgar Square and history. It was 3 million then who were thrown on the dole. Unemployment was a price worth paying, Mrs Thatcher said. Millions of people, entire communities, some blighted to this day, suffered the consequences. Britain is now a different place, but for Brexiteers to advocate leaving the EU oblivious to the consequences is grossly irresponsible. Britain\u2019s national interest may not count too much for Boris Johnson, but to believe that a DIY recession is a price worth paying is a betrayal of the British people.Jack Dromey MPLabour, Birmingham Erdington \u2022 Guardian assistant letters editor Mike Carter, whose father Pete was also an organiser of the People\u2019s March for Jobs, is currently walking from Liverpool to London, retracing the route of the march.
