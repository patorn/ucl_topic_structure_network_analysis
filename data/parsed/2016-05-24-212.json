  "body": "Many of the reviews I\u2019ve read of DeLillo\u2019s latest book, Zero K, talk about \u201clate period\u201d DeLillo, suggesting that since Underworld, he\u2019s been prone to writing similar books \u2013 marked by slender plotting, elusive meanings and dense, elliptical prose. What most reviewers don\u2019t say is that another characteristic of these late novels is that they generally need to be read more than once to be understood, and that they sometimes take years to mature in the reader\u2019s mind. Most famously, the New York Times\u2019s Michiko Kakutani derided Cosmopolis as \u201ca major dud\u201d when it came out in 2003 \u2013 but it now seems like a near-magical (and hilarious) pre-imagining of the 2008 financial crash. Personally, I misunderstood and didn\u2019t enjoy DeLillo\u2019s The Body Artist the first time I read it \u2013 but have been haunted by its evocation of loss ever since.   Related: Zero K by Don DeLillo \u2013 profound and beautiful    So right now, I\u2019m not going to venture anything like a definite judgment on Zero K. I\u2019ve finished it, but I haven\u2019t  really come to terms with it. I reserve the right to change my mind \u2013 to let it grow or diminish. I suspect there\u2019s much I\u2019ve missed and I know there\u2019s plenty I haven\u2019t yet understood. The prose is rich, chewy and best consumed in small mouthfuls, so I had to plod through it haltingly \u2013 but I relished it all the more in consequence. While I\u2019ve been reasonably sure of my feelings about White Noise over the past few weeks of our Reading group, it\u2019s challenging to turn from that book to Zero K. But it\u2019s also fascinating, because the two books have a lot in common. In fact, my initial reaction to Zero K was that it was an ideal companion to White Noise, that the later novel wraps up many of the ideas in the earlier one \u2013 and so it makes sense to move direct from one to the other.  A character in White Noise suggests \u201call plots end in death\u201d. Zero K suspends its characters in a never-ending death, when they are cryonically frozen in a place called the Convergence, somewhere in the former Soviet Union. As in White Noise, the characters are confronted by torrents of information, news, nonsense and media static assailing them in the back of taxis, in their homes, in the otherwise sterile corridors of the Convergence.   DeLillo\u2019s new narrator, Jeffrey Lockhart shows a delight in language similar to Jack Gladney\u2019s: \u201cShe was my lover. The idea consoled me, the word itself, lover, the beautiful musical note, the hovering letter v.\u201d There are familiar riffs on simulacra and unreality: \u201cI stood in the booth, counting \u2026 It didn\u2019t seem to be me. It seemed someone else, a recluse who\u2019d wandered into semi-public view, standing here and counting.\u201d      In Zero K, is DeLillo is self-consciously playing on his own canon? Photograph: Jean-Christian Bourcart/Getty Images    Such parallels are striking, but I suspect I would find just as many in other DeLillo books. Even with my rusty memory I could link a series of violent, murderous and apparently \u201creal\u201d films in the Convergence to the footage of the Texas Highway Killer in Underworld and repeated motifs of flickering images from other novels. It\u2019s also possible to see those details about screens in the back of a taxi rebroadcasting ideas from Cosmopolis. And there are similar reflections in dozens of other ideas about bankers, cults, remote desert underground facilities. In a fine essay in the Vulture, Christian Lorentzen even notes that a passage where Lockhart does squat jumps reminded him of one in End Zone, and that some of Zero K\u2019s comic dialogue will sound to devotees like a \u201cmaster playing tennis with himself across the decades\u201d. I\u2019m open to the possibility that these parallels with earlier works are incidental. They relate to ideas that have fascinated and troubled DeLillo throughout his career and his intention may be simply to give them new iterations here, rather than to be self-referential. But if DeLillo is self-consciously playing on his own canon, that would fit neatly with what I\u2019ve come to see as a major theme in the book. While I originally took Zero K as a reflection on mortality and what it means to die, it now also seems to me to be about the artist\u2019s contest with infinity. \u201cAll plots end in death\u201d is developed into the question of what happens to stories once their creator moves on \u2013 or, how much of the creator remains in those stories. For instance, the first person we see anaesthetised and frozen is called Artis (genitive of \u201cars\u201d, if you\u2019re a Latin fan \u2013 which is to say, \u201cof art\u201d). We are told that \u201cdeath is a cultural artifact\u201d and that their frozen clients will be \u201csubjects for us to study, toys for us to play with\u201d. We are even shown frozen bodies arranged around the Convergence building like so many macabre sculptures. If this version of the afterlife is a metaphor for art, it\u2019s a grim one, even if it\u2019s also amusing: the implication being that striving for immortality in art is as absurd as paying a fortune to have someone freeze your dead body. Entering the bargain with the assumption that you will be given an escape from death, the best you can hope for is to have your cold husk displayed for the amusement of future generations, after everything that actually made your conscious being has long since left the building.   Related: Don DeLillo: \u2018I think of myself as the kid from the Bronx\u2019    Neatly, this idea has already appeared in DeLillo. In Point Omega, we\u2019re told: \u201cThe true life is not reducible to words spoken or written, not by anyone, ever.\u201d In White Noise, meanwhile, Jack Gladney already feels like he is the false character following his name around. Set in this context, DeLillo\u2019s references to his earlier works throughout Zero K become another brilliantly deadpan joke. The book also becomes the place where all those wonderful books meet their end, although I hope not. I hope I\u2019ve got it wrong \u2013 like most of us do when first reading late period DeLillo. I hope that there will be more books, both to blast apart this thesis and to intrigue us anew.",
