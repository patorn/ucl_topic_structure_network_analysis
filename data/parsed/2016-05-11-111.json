  "body": "German media giant Bauer is to merge its two UK publishing operations, bringing together titles including Take A Break, TV Choice and Grazia with Heat, Kerrang! and Q. The two operations, Bauer Media and H Bauer, will be run by long-serving Bauer Media chief executive Paul Keenan. H Bauer runs more than a dozen titles including TV Choice, the biggest TV listings magazine in the UK, and Take A Break, the UK\u2019s biggest women\u2019s weekly magazine. The move will mean Keenan will now have responsibility for all Bauer\u2019s UK and Scandinavian magazine, radio and digital operations. Bauer Media also owns radio stations including Kiss, Magic and Absolute.

Andreas Schoo, executive board member at Bauer Media Group, said the move to merge the operations aimed to boost cost-savings and growth opportunities in the UK. \u201cTo increase our growth, operational performance and competitiveness, we have decided to consolidate our UK and Nordic operations under the leadership of Paul,\u201d said Schoo. \u201cThis will strengthen our business for the future and enable us to seize new opportunities in these key territories.\u201d",
