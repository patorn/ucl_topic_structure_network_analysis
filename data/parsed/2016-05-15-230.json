Speaking on Sky on Sunday Di Natale rejected Labor\u2019s claims it would not make a deal or agreement to form minority government with the Greens as unrealistic and \u201ca lot of tough talk in the lead-up to the election\u201d. \u201cWhen faced with the prospect of governing, wiser heads will prevail and it makes more sense to enter into a responsible power-sharing arrangement with the Greens,\u201d he said. When asked about the Greens\u2019 policy priorities, Di Natale listed many including strong action on global warming, fighting inequality and a national anti-corruption watchdog.   Related: Battle for Brisbane: a diverse set of campaigners vie for Queensland's 'groovy seat'    One of the priorities was \u201ca more decent and compassionate treatment of those people legitimately seeking asylum\u201d.  Di Natale rejected the view that refugee policy was a binary of \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201copen the floodgates\u201d as a nonsense. Asked more directly about what policy concessions the Greens would seek from Labor, Di Natale cited stronger action on global warming and more humane refugee policy. \u201cLabor wants to take $1bn out of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do anything about those massive fossil fuel subsidies. That\u2019s not a climate policy. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a veneer of increasing the renewable energy target, nowhere near where it needs to be ... So the Labor party policy is a significant improvement on the Coalition\u2019s policy ... [but] the Labor party policy falls well short. \u201cDon\u2019t for a moment think we can\u2019t get an improvement to refugee policy. There is a way through this. One of the things I commit to doing if there is the potential for power-sharing or a multiparty government is to improve what we\u2019re doing to people seeking refuge and asylum in this country.\u201d In July the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, won a major policy battle getting support from Labor national conference for a policy of towing back boats of asylum seekers and offshore detention. But, since the election was called on 8 May, Shorten has been forced to answer questions about numerous candidates who supported the Let Them Stay movement, which aimed to prevent 267 asylum seekers being returned to offshore detention. Labor supports regional processing but doesn\u2019t want it to degenerate into indefinite detention.  On Saturday, Shorten said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the government hasn\u2019t tried harder with nations in our region ... I promise that we will make sure that we process these people and get them into nations in our region but we will not reopen the seaways.\u201d It comes as Liberal candidate for Mackellar, Jason Falinski, repudiated a view he expressed in 2001 that asylum seekers who come by boat should be welcomed rather than shunned.   Related: Durack: Australia's largest electorate feels like it's being ignored    According to the Fairfax report, Falinski said: \u201cThe Coalition committed to stopping the boats and that\u2019s exactly what has been done through a strong border protection policy, which I wholeheartedly support.\u201d Di Natale said Labor was wary of forming government with the Greens because it mistakenly believed the 2010 deal between Julia Gillard and the Greens had harmed Labor. In fact, it was \u201cthe chaos turmoil and internal division of the Rudd-Gillard governments\u201d that ended what he said was a \u201cvery effective period of government\u201d. He said he simply \u201cdid not buy\u201d Labor\u2019s talk it would not do a deal with the Greens, citing the former leader Bob Brown\u2019s assessment that \u201cthese parties exist to attain power \u2013 the idea that they would walk away is not real world politics\u201d. Di Natale said Labor would need to a deal with the Greens to form \u201cresponsible, stable government\u201d because otherwise it would worry about \u201cevery piece of legislation on floor of parliament where you don\u2019t know the outcome of that vote\u201d.  He also rejected the prospect Labor would prefer a return to the polls, a threat suggested by the Greens treasury spokesman, Adam Bandt, to force Labor to the negotiating table. \u201cI think Australians want another election like they want a hole in the head,\u201d Di Natale said. He effectively ruled out forming government with the Coalition, noting it would take a \u201cDamascus road conversion\u201d by the Coalition on refugees and global warming. Responding to the comments on Sunday morning, Shorten again ruled out dealing with the Greens in the event of a hung parliament. \u201cThe issues and this nation are going to be determined only [by] the Labor government. What matters is not what the Greens think in the Senate, it is what Australian families and small businesses think,\u201d he said.",
