  "body": "Early reviewers of Jane Eyre complained that Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s protagonist was impossible to like. Ironic, intractable, angry and culpably plain, Jane stood stubbornly apart from the blueprint of Victorian femininity. It\u2019s a tribute to Cathy Marston, in her new work for Northern Ballet, that she\u2019s choreographed a Jane who is similarly emancipated from the conventional tropes of the ballet heroine. Dividing the role between young and adult Jane, Marston shows a novelist\u2019s touch in building the layers of her character. Antoinette Brooks-Daw is superb in the early scenes, both frozen and furious, and Marston\u2019s choreography vibrates with suggestive detail. As Jane battles against her bullying Aunt Reed, her jagged, sideways jump, her bullishly lowered head, her pummelling fists convey not only her volcanic temper but also her quickness of mind.     Antoinette Brooks-Daw as Young Jane and Matthew Koon as John. Photograph: Emma Kauldhar    Those fists remain Jane\u2019s leitmotif even when she\u2019s grown up \u2013 clenched quietly behind her back as she resists a hostile world. Marston does nothing by rote, each detail feels specially minted, from the ritualistic gesture with which Jane encloses her face, as if protecting her independence of mind, to the slow, poignant dip into pli\u00e9 as she pirouettes towards Rochester and first feels the inexorable tug of sexual passion. Dreda Blow\u2019s performance builds steadily, a moving combination of turbulence and reserve and she has a fine partner in Javier Torres\u2019 Rochester, who manages to convey some of the sheer sardonic force of his character\u2019s presence. There\u2019s a moment when Rochester, lounging in his chair, bars Jane\u2019s exit with his outstretched foot and even in 2016 it feels like a dangerous breach of social taboo. Marston\u2019s ballet succeeds where it matters most: in the creation of her lovers. She gets excellent support from Philip Feeney\u2019s score \u2013 a subtle and very danceable blend of original and 19th-century music \u2013 and also from Patrick Kinmonth\u2019s set, with its lively delineations of domestic interiors and wild moorland. Marston\u2019s handling of Bront\u00eb\u2019s framing narrative is at its best when most economical: the chorus of slate-scratching pupils at Lowood school; the symbolic frieze of dancers at Rochester\u2019s party.     \u2018Feels like a dangerous breach of social taboo\u2019 \u2026 Matthew Koon and Antoinette Brooks-Daw. Photograph: Emma Kauldhar    Some of her devices don\u2019t quite work. The male chorus who represent Jane\u2019s inner demons might give necessary employment to the men in the company but they mean that Jane, so solitary a character in the novel, is rarely alone on stage. Marston could also have been bolder in her cuts, abandoning the more literal exposition of mad Bertha\u2019s story and allowing her a more symbolic presence. St John Rivers could possibly have been ditched: as the novel\u2019s dullest character, he\u2019s a weight on Marston\u2019s second act.  But the ballet soars in the lovers\u2019 closing duet, a moving argument of mutual discovery, tenderness and ecstasy that is beautifully articulated through the choreography. And I salute Marston for concluding the ballet not with a loving embrace but with Jane leaving Rochester behind as she walks confidently towards the audience. Jane Eyre\u2019s triumph is not to get her man, but to gain ownership of her future.  At Cast, Doncaster, until 21 May. Box office: 0130-2303 959. Then at Richmond theatre, 31 May-1 June. Box office: 0844-871 7651.",
