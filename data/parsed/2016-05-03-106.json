  "body": "Recep Tayipp Erdo\u011fan and his sense-of-humour-free government have spent the past few weeks hitting out at any and everyone. The Turkish president\u2019s spectacular ability to take offence and ping out accusations of \u201cspy!\u201d and \u201cterrorist!\u201d is now such that the renowned Do-Not-Insultan has turned his thin-skinned, pointy-finger towards free speech in Europe. Since Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to approve a prosecution request for comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann for performing a poem mocking Erdo\u011fan\u2019s response to the video of his \u201cinsulting\u201d song Erdowie, Erdowo, Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish president has been capitalising on his success. It seems he is actively targeting other European countries that, like Germany, still have outdated, and often near forgotten about, lese-majesty laws. Similar to Turkey\u2019s Article 229, which concerns defamation of the president, these \u201cinjured majesty\u201d laws make it a crime to insult rulers or heads of state. They often include other \u201cfriendly\u201d leaders, too \u2013 section 103 of Germany\u2019s criminal code prohibits \u201cinsulting organs or representatives of foreign states\u201d. Turkey recently attempted to use the Dutch version of the law, requesting that Turks working in the Netherlands snitch on each other. A leaked email from Rotterdam\u2019s Turkish Consulate General to Turkish organisations operating in the country appeared to ask them \u2013 although the consulate insists it was all just a misunderstanding \u2013 to report back on anyone who had insulted either the Turkish president or the Turkish state.   Related: Dutch journalist arrested in Turkey for criticising Erdo\u011fan    Dutch-Turkish journalist Ebra Umar was then arrested on holiday in Turkey after someone reported her for tweeting sections of a column she\u2019d written for the Dutch Metro criticising the email. She compared it to practices used by the Dutch arm of the Nazi party during the second world war, which probably hit a nerve after the media furore that surrounded a speech from Erdo\u011fan in January that appeared \u2013 another misunderstanding \u2013 to cite Hitler\u2019s Germany as an example of effective government. Dutch comedian Hans Teeuwen could be prosecuted, too. When asked about the B\u00f6hmermann case in an interview he claimed that Erdo\u011fan used to be a \u201cboywhore\u201d in an Istanbul brothel and that the leader still owed him a blow job. The Turkish government also last week demanded the removal of a photo of a boy from an exhibition in Geneva that associated Erdo\u011fan with his death \u2013 he was killed by a tear gas canister fired by police during the 2013 Gezi Park anti-government protests. The Swiss government rejected the demand, but if you live in Italy, Spain, Denmark or Norway, you might want to watch your back. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s attempts to silence his critics often have the opposite result. There are few better instances of the Streisand effect (when an attempt to hide something actually results in far more publicity) than the time Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson waded into the debate over whether a Turkish doctor facing prosecution had shared a meme that compared Erdo\u011fan to Gollum or the far friendlier Sm\u00e9agol. It resulted in the little-seen images being shared by news outlets across the globe. Attempts by the Tall Man \u2013 a nickname used by the president\u2019s supporters, and with a well-concealed snigger, his detractors \u2013 to flex his muscles beyond Turkey\u2019s borders and have a go at freedom of speech in Europe have also backfired. Outrage at the use of laws that were, until now, rarely used outside of Thailand, has caused European countries to scramble to rid themselves of the lese-majesty. On Thursday, Germany\u2019s justice ministry completed a draft to abolish its version. Merkel had previously promised that the law would be removed by 2018 as a result of the embarrassing B\u00f6hmermann affair and the furious debate over freedom of speech that followed, but it\u2019s been fast-tracked. The draft included the statement: \u201cThe idea that foreign state representatives need special protection against insults does not accord with the era.\u201d The Dutch government, too, has said it will reform its old law. Just last year there were calls for it to be removed after an activist faced prosecution for saying \u201cfuck the king\u201d when he was arrested for protesting. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s current taste for the law, however, has prompted Dutch MPs to push for a removal, and quickly. The justice minister said the constitution should not be a \u201cmuseum for out-of-date articles\u201d. In Switzerland, repeal of the law has been called for by politicians from both sides of the political spectrum in the wake of the B\u00f6hmermann case. Former cabinet minister Jean-Christophe Schwaab said: \u201cThe fact that you can be prosecuted for insulting a foreign head of state here in Switzerland reminds me of the Middle Ages.\u201d Despite all the foot stamping, efforts by the oversensitive leader to further his influence and curtail freedom of speech across Europe have been counterproductive. The removal of the lese-majesty is a victory for free speech and a further step away from state censorship powers. Despite Erdo\u011fan\u2019s best efforts, Europe has firmly sided with the right to criticise and to make fun because if you can\u2019t laugh, what can you do? Become the president of the Turkish Republic, perhaps.",
