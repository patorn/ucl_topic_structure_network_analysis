  "body": "At this point in the election campaign, it pays to be reminded of one far more drawn-out \u2013 and, let\u2019s be honest, with higher stakes \u2013 than our own. On Friday Bill Shorten did just that, publicly condemning Donald J Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate (yes \u2013 it does no one favours to shy from the truth). After suggesting President Trump might be \u201chard to work with\u201d earlier in the campaign \u2013 which seemed like stating the bleeding obvious even then \u2013 Shorten went perhaps a tad too far in the other direction, characterising Trump\u2019s views as \u201cbarking mad\u201d in a radio interview in Darwin. He later toned it down to \u201cerratic\u201d at a press conference. But remember, this is a potential Australian PM speaking about a potential US president. You can\u2019t help but be reminded of when John Howard suggested al-Qaida in Iraq would be praying for the election of Barack Obama. \u201cYou can make observations, you don\u2019t have to stand mute on the sidelines, but you\u2019ve got to keep your thumb and index finger on your own volume button,\u201d observed Katharine Murphy in the blog. Malcolm Turnbull said something similar \u2013 that one\u2019s private views should be kept private when expressing them publicly could go against the national interest. He noted that an American president\u2019s description of an aspiring Australian prime minister as \u201cbarking mad\u201d would create \u201cill will and resentment\u201d.  Turnbull spent the day in Brisbane, unveiling a $115m program to support Indigenous entrepreneurship. He said reconciliation was a \u201cgreat national journey ... a road of healing\u201d that the Liberals were \u201cembarked on ... with commitment\u201d. Shorten was in the Northern Territory to announce $200m over four years to expand the Indigenous ranger program. Butting heads over black holes The treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, went head-to-head at the National Press Club in Canberra on Friday afternoon. The public sniping between the two parties over what the Liberals see as Labor\u2019s irresponsible spending and Labor sees as the Liberals\u2019 fudging the price of their policies has been a cornerstone of the campaign this week, which might be why, at this point in the week, you feel like you\u2019ve been banging your head against a wall. Guardian Australia\u2019s Gareth Hutchens has the lowdown on this low point of the campaign thus far, with the takeaway: \u201cThe treasurer of Australia happily admitted misleading voters and he\u2019s proud of it.\u201d But the debate was \u201cthoroughly worth watching\u201d, wrote Katharine Murphy in the blog, \u201ctight and fiercely contested, yet civil\u201d. It encapsulated the competing world views on offer at the coming election, she said, \u201cwhich is more than we can say about the last week of the campaign itself\u201d.  Essential protein Barnaby Joyce, the source of headaches for both Turnbull and Johnny Depp earlier this week, is continuing to face questions over his comments linking Australia\u2019s suspension of live cattle exports with more asylum seeker boat arrivals, two issues that definitely needed to be linked. Indonesia appears to have accepted the government\u2019s explanation yesterday, a team effort on the part of not only the prime minister but also the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, and the resources minister, Josh Frydenberg. The ABC reported that a spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s foreign ministry said Turnbull and Bishp\u2019s explanation was \u201cclear\u201d and it would issue no further response. Now that\u2019s what you call damage control. But Joyce had to field questions about his comments while out campaigning in Tweed Heads, part of his bid to win New England against the independent Tony Windsor. Asked whether Joyce meant to suggest that Indonesia let policing the people-smuggling trade slide because of the ban on live cattle exports, Joyce said it can\u2019t have helped relations between the two countries. Actually, what he said was \u201cbanning the supply of an essential part of protein ... for the people of Jakarta ... is not how you build relations\u201d. On his chances in New England he said he was \u201cconfident but not cocky\u201d. Good to know.

BuzzFeed has the epic tale in full. And also ... The lead author of a major UN report on climate change has expressed his shock that every reference to Australia was removed from the final version, following intervention from the Australian government. Guardian Australia on Friday revealed that chapters on the Great Barrier Reef and sections on Kakadu and Tasmanian forests were removed from the World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate report, following the Australian Department of Environment\u2019s objection that the information could harm tourism. The draft chapter on the reef pulled from the report but published exclusively by Guardian Australia warned that the reef was \u201cpoor and deteriorating\u201d and \u201cassailed by multiple threats\u201d.

The tech-savvy politician (everything\u2019s relative) joined the app on Thursday night but had to ask Nine\u2019s Today Show crew to teach her how to use it this morning. Her first story showed her making an espresso coffee. Scintillating stuff. We look forward to seeing what more premium content Bishop will bring to this platform.
