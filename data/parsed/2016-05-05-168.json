  "body": "Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019s three concertos, all composed between 2011 and 2013, were composed with very specific soloists in mind. Two of them, the violinist Midori and percussionist Martin Grubinger, appear on this disc, while the Cello Concerto Grosso was originally intended for E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019s fellow Hungarian Mikl\u00f3s Per\u00e9nyi, but is played here by Jean-Guihen Queyras. In all of them, the solo instrument is very much a dramatic protagonist, a larger-than-life character constantly proposing unexpected musical ideas, to which the orchestra responds with its own repertoire of extrovert effects. This seems most effective in the violin work DoReMi, which seems perfectly tailored to the brilliance of Midori\u2019s playing, and in the sheer theatricality and almost improvisatory quality of Talking Drums, in which Grubinger has to deliver fragments of poems by S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res and a Sanskrit text by the Indian poet Jayadeva, as well as playing a wide range of tuned and untuned instruments. The cello concerto is perhaps more conventional, but the finesse of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019s orchestral writing, and Queyras\u2019s virtuosity, make it seem almost as compelling.",
