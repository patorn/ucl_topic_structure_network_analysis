  "body": "A few weekends ago, Chelsie Wilson spotted Tinder on her boyfriend\u2019s phone. She was angry. They\u2019d met on the dating app seven months earlier and he\u2019d promised that he wouldn\u2019t download it on his new phone. Now, he was full of excuses. He claimed Tinder had transferred automatically from his old device, that he liked to swipe through her profile pictures and read their old messages. But Wilson didn\u2019t believe him. A few days later, Wilson went in to work at a credit union in St Louis and confessed to colleagues that she thought her boyfriend might be cheating on her. A co-worker mentioned Swipebuster, a new website that scans Tinder\u2019s public database and reveals whether someone has a profile and the last time they used it for the low price of $4.99. Wilson is not normally the jealous type, but she had a \u201cgut feeling\u201d that something was wrong. So she paid the $5 and ran a search. Technology has made it easier than ever to be unfaithful. Apps like Tinder, Bumble and Grindr present a never-ending rolodex of hookups-to-be, while messaging services store illicit dinner plans in password-protected phones. But it\u2019s also easier than ever to catch a cheating partner with a vast selection of websites, apps and spyware that can monitor their mobile footprints. Clandestine services, such as Swipebuster, that allow jealous lovers to track someone\u2019s activity without their knowledge are the most controversial. They range from websites that scrape public data (perfectly legal) to spyware such as FlexiSPY and mSpy that, once covertly installed, enable remote surveillance of a person\u2019s phone (not so legal). On the more ethical side are apps such as Couple Tracker and mCouple that allow partners to consensually access each other\u2019s texts, calls, Facebook activity and GPS location.      The Smarttress mattress is the world\u2019s first smart mattress, said to be able to detect infidelity in couples by means of a mobile app. Photograph: Diego Lopez/EPA    And then there\u2019s the flat-out weird, such as smoke detector hidden cameras and mattresses with motion sensors that expose questionable activity. These technologies can provide closure to a suspicious partner, but they can also stoke paranoia and exacerbate the very trust issues they seek to fix. Couples do not snoop on one another because they are unethical monsters. They snoop to get tangible proof their suspicions. Any therapist or good friend will tell you it\u2019s better to talk to your partner in person than install an app that tracks their location, but if the answer to \u201care you cheating on me?\u201d is \u201cno\u201d, it can be tough to accept the denial and move on. Doubt can be as powerful as certainty. Sex therapist Jennine Estes doesn\u2019t judge clients who have resorted to spyware. \u201cOften, their snooping has a payout,\u201d she says. \u201cThey find things their partner would not \u2019fess up to, and my job is to help them process what happened.\u201d Wilson found out through Swipebuster that her boyfriend had logged on to Tinder the same morning she did the search. After he denied that he used the app, Wilson told him she had \u201cways to find out\u201d that his profile was active. The next weekend, she asked to see his phone and threatened to cut off all contact if he resisted. He caved. Wilson saw that between November and January, her boyfriend had messaged up to eight women on Tinder (she was too nervous to look at the more recent months). In one exchange, he asked a woman if she wanted to meet up. \u201cYou\u2019re single, right?\u201d she asked. \u201cOf course, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he responded.     In one exchange he asked a woman if she wanted to meet. 'You\u2019re single?' she asked. 'Of course, aren\u2019t you?' he answered    Ethics aside, covert monitoring technology is also legally controversial. Since Swipebuster uses public data, the website is lawful, but in most states it is illegal to track information from someone\u2019s device without their consent, according to David Klein, a lawyer who specializes in technology and marketing law. Many spyware companies will claim their products are designed for the legal purposes of monitoring minors or in some cases company employees, but their websites usually also market to suspicious husbands and wives. On the other hand, tracking apps that couples mutually agree to use can be both legal and helpful in the right scenario. Therapist Estes says full transparency can be particularly effective in the aftermath of an affair, when trust is shattered. \u201cWords can lose value when somebody\u2019s been violated,\u201d she says. \u201cThese apps help give them proof \u2026 that their partner\u2019s behaviors and words are matching up.\u201d Mik Bauer says Couple Tracker has helped him and his husband of four years work out trust issues. Both had been unfaithful, and his partner struggled with jealousy related to Bauer\u2019s frequent business travel. \u201cThe app gives him peace of mind,\u201d says the 38 year-old. \u201cHe can have that confidence of knowing where I\u2019m at.\u201d The downside, of course, is that these apps can encourage paranoia. There are often GPS glitches, one of which initially made Bauer\u2019s husband think he was at Chicago\u2019s Trump International Hotel and Tower rather than a conference room, and checking your spouse\u2019s phone can quickly become an addiction. Monica, who declined to give her last name, says Couple Tracker amplified jealousy in her relationship. Though only her boyfriend had cheated, he installed the app on her phone and constantly bombarded her with questions. Her GPS would sometimes fail and he would suspect an affair. \u201cIt was like a leash,\u201d says the 42-year-old bartender with three kids. While part of her liked being able to hold him accountable for late nights, the app raised too many doubts. \u201cI always wondered: was he doing this or that? Why\u2019s he there?\u201d she says. \u201cIt just brought up more issues than there were to begin with.\u201d While Estes says the apps can help ease short-term pain, over the long term they create a dynamic in which a couple relies on technology more than one another for trust. \u201cThe partner can never give comfort and reassurance because the other person\u2019s always going into their phone and saying: \u2018What about this, what about that?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt can drive a huge wedge between relationships.\u201d After Wilson saw her boyfriend\u2019s Tinder messages, she cried on his couch while he begged her not to leave. He said all the right things and \u201cswore on his life\u201d he had not had an actual affair. Still, Wilson isn\u2019t sure she can ever trust him again. And while she\u2019s glad Swipebuster exists and admits a tracking app could help with jealousy, another digital fix feels desperate.  \u201cI really like that idea that technology that can help you know if your partner\u2019s being faithful,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it also makes me so sad that in this day and age, these apps are what people have to resort to.\u201d",
