The figures set off strong speculation that Tuesday will see an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank. But while low inflation is a sign of a lack of demand in the economy, the latest figures suggest that the treasurer, Scott Morrison, is the one who needs to act, rather than the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens.   Related: Asylum and climate change are back in the news \u2013 and the response has been pathetic | Lenore Taylor    We currently live in a world of very low inflation \u2013 historically so. We have become so used to low inflation that three months ago annual inflation growth of 1.7% was seen as too high to allow an interest rate cut. In previous years such a level would have been seen as scarily low. Prepare to get scared. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in the first three months of this year prices fell by 0.2% (the first such fall since December 2008) and annual inflation came in at a carpet-burning low of 1.3%:    \u00a0   Underlying inflation, which is generally seen as the guide for interest rate decisions, also recorded very weak results. In the March quarter the two measures of underlying inflation \u2013 the trimmed mean and the weighted median rose \u2013 by just 0.2% and 0.1% respectively:    \u00a0   This saw the weighted median recording a record low annual growth of 1.4% and the trimmed mean tying its record low of 1.7%:    \u00a0   However you want to cut it, inflation growth is near enough to \u201cbugger all\u201d to call it thus without risking serious error. The market reacted swiftly. On Monday the futures market was pricing in a 16% chance of a rate cut tomorrow; by the end of trading on Tuesday it was rated a 53% chance, by Friday it was 58%:    \u00a0   The market now fully expects a rate cut by August and a 50% chance of another cut to 1.5% by February next year. A big reason for the deflation in the March quarter was petrol. Falling oil prices in January and February saw automotive fuel prices drop 10% in the March quarter \u2013 the sixth-largest fall in a quarter since the ABS started recording fuel prices in 1972:    \u00a0   Since February, however, oil prices have been rising slowly, so it is likely that the June quarter will see fuel prices rising on average.  But fuel wasn\u2019t the biggest fall in the quarter \u2013 that title went to fruit, which fell 11.1%. Although the fall was less when seasonally adjusted, even on that measure it was the second biggest fall. Fruit, like automotive fuel, is classed as a \u201ctradeable\u201d item \u2013 one that has its price determined significantly outside our borders \u2013 and it was such items that really drove the fall in inflation. Tradable items fell 1.4% in the March quarter \u2013 the biggest fall since December 2008:    \u00a0   But over the past year it is non-tradable items that are showing record weak growth. In the past 12 months the price of non-tradables items (such as takeway food, rents, utilities charges, house prices, health and education expenses) increased by just 1.7% - the lowest this century:    \u00a0   This low price growth of such goods and services really reflects the lack of demand in the economy and why many expect the RBA to cut rates. But should the RBA do it? Over the past few years one key aspect of the government\u2019s budget strategy is the decided lack of interest in stimulating demand in the economy. Essentially Joe Hockey hoped the private sector with the assistance of low interest rates would do the job. But thus far there is little sign of that strategy working. The latest producer price figures released on Friday showed domestic final demand (excluding exports) fell by 0.2% in the March quarter and the annual growth of just 0.8% is a level usually associated with recessions. The December mid-year fiscal and economic outlook revised up the level of growth of public demand for this year to 2.0% from the 1.5% expected in last year\u2019s budget. But it made no change for 2016-17:    \u00a0   A key measure to look for in Tuesday\u2019s budget is whether or not the government is to increase public demand \u2013 in effect trying to stimulate the economy through fiscal spending. Clearly the signs are there won\u2019t be any major spending of a traditional sort but there is strong talk that the government will use \u201coff-budget\u201d measures to pay for infrastructure. Such spending may not increase the deficit but it should increase public demand growth. The RBA would be glad to see it. Stevens has for a long time been warning that lowering rates doesn\u2019t have the power to boost the economy that it once did. Just two weeks ago he told an audience in New York that \u201cwhile people find global growth outcomes still a bit disappointing, we are reaching the limits of monetary policy in boosting it\u201d. He argued that \u201ccentral banks must of course do what they can\u201d but \u201csurely diminishing returns are setting in\u201d and he suspected \u201cthat more and more people realise this\u201d. But the question is whether or not the treasury realises this or whether he still wants to leave it up to lower interest rates to do the heavy lifting.",
