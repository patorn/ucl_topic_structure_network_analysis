  "body": "TRACK OF THE WEEK Braids Companion            Less is more. Well, except with curry, obviously. And money. And safety checks on aeroplanes. And \u2013 OK, less is occasionally more. Here\u2019s one case in which it is: the beautiful minimalist synth backdrop of Companion, over which Raphaelle Standell\u2019s remarkable voice flutters between Elizabeth Fraser on Massive Attack\u2019s Teardrop and Bj\u00f6rk when she\u2019s feeling an emotion really hard. Which is about the highest praise it\u2019s possible to give a vocalist. If you don\u2019t get chills, you must have killed before, and you probably will again. Taylor Swift New Romantics            Taylor Swift Review Template: say she\u2019s the biggest pop star in the world yet also \u201cso down to earth\u201d. Mention how she\u2019s a positive role model. Move on to how going from country to pop may seem calculating, but when it\u2019s done this well, who cares? End with the suggestion that if you don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d Taylor, it\u2019s you that\u2019s wrong. Don\u2019t mention the fact that her music is objectively terrible, unless you\u2019re 12. Give it four stars. Weep. Future ft the Weeknd Low Life            Appreciating hip-hop while ignoring some of its more odious content can be tricksy but here, Future and the disastrously barnetted Weeknd cover the usual yawnsome cliches \u2013 \u201chos\u201d, \u201cbitches\u201d, \u201cMolly\u201d \u2013 while wryly toying with the tropes. \u201cYeah, they stereotyping,\u201d snarls Future over a spectral, skittering drum line and oozing bass. It\u2019s self-referential, and really quite good. Goo Goo Dolls So Alive            Saying Goo Goo Dolls are, generally, a bit bland is like saying some of the Westboro Baptist Church\u2019s views are \u201cslightly iffy\u201d. So fans of Iris may prepare to have their minds well and truly unblown by this \u2013 odourless pop-rock guff that, if anything, has removed what few rough edges Goo Goo Dolls everhad. An achievement, that \u2013 like sanding air. Blossoms Getaway            There\u2019s something commendable about a band who so shamelessly court the mainstream dollar you can almost hear the Veuve Clicquot corks a-popping in the mix. Early releases Cut Me And I\u2019ll Bleed and Charlemagne suggested a thrilling psych-indie outfit with a bloodhound\u2019s nose for a chorus hook; Getaway sees Blossoms abandon any lingering pretense of \u201cindie\u201d and settle snugly into \u201cOne Direction B-side with a Harry co-writing credit\u201d. A lucrative future in X Factor montage soundtracking awaits.",
