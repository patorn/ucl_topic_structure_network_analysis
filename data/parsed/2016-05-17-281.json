She shares the city with 13.35 million other residents, but had no one to turn to when she was suffering from anorexia and bulimia. It\u2019s an issue she has faced since she was 11. \u201cBulimia is very common, but in Japan people don\u2019t really care about mental health issues,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople just avoid talking about them.\u201d She could not open up to friends and family members, and so ended up joining Overeaters Anonymous, a programme that tackles a variety of food-related issues from starving to using food as a reward. She also started going to an English language help centre for counselling, but the service is expensive and ineffective.  \u201cNone of the help offered has been of any use,\u201d she continues. \u201cI can talk for about five minutes in Overeaters Anonymous and that\u2019s about it. In my experience, no one really understands having an eating disorder, so there\u2019s basically no one who can help.\u201d Japanese doctors warned recently that their health system is failing hundreds of thousands of people like Akira \u2014 many of them teenage girls. The BBC spoke to Dr Toshio Ishikwa, president of the Japan Society for Eating Disorders, who said: \u201cIt\u2019s often too late by the time the patient is seen in a hospital. Their condition is very severe. Sometimes they are even close to death.\u201d  This needs to change \u2013 and fast, as eating disorders have been on the rise since the 1980s (pdf), according to a 2009 study. Another study last year, which was based on questionnaires sent to schools in seven prefectures in Japan, found that the prevalence of anorexia nervosa among adolescents is similar to that found in Europe and the US. It particularly affects girls: the number of boys affected was one third that of girls in some prefectures. Few hospitals in Japan deal specifically with eating disorders and most sufferers, like Akira, must go to independent clinics where staff are not trained to assess the psychological causes of the illness. The government partly funds a handful of community support groups, which can help spot the early signs of illness.  But change may be on the way. In 2000, the ministry of health, labour and welfare drew up plans to research the issue and established specialised medical centres throughout Japan. Last year, they created a policy to fund five acute treatment centres for eating disorders in hospitals around the country, as well as putting money towards a national centre.  The biggest independent support organisation at the moment is the Nippon Anorexia and Bulimia Association, a self-help group comprised of 200 chronic sufferers of anorexia and bulimia. It\u2019s where Kaiyo, 42, who has suffered from bulimia, went when she was 17. \u201cTheir format was similar to Anorexics Anonymous, where you talk about and accept your problems with others, but it wasn\u2019t effective enough.\u201d  Doctors have agreed that support groups on their own are not sufficient. Part of the reason for the lack of treatment is cultural, according to Hanu, 23, who says there is a stigma around eating disorders and mental health concerns in Japan. Hanu has been bingeing and purging since she was in high school but has never been diagnosed, despite seeing a psychiatrist for years. Hanu says that her eating disorder is not about body image. \u201cWhen it all started, eating was, for me, the only sensually satisfying experience. Japanese people never hug or kiss or cuddle and, even as a kid, you don\u2019t get many of these from your parents or siblings. I think that\u2019s why I resorted to comfort from eating at an early age.\u201d Eri, 45, agrees. She started binge eating to help deal with life\u2019s pressures, but then found eating itself became a stress. Both she and Hanu also talk about the shame and guilt associated with wasting food.  \u201cThis is particularly true in Japan,\u201d she continues. \u201cMaybe it came from the first world war \u2013 when we were forced to provide food for the imperial soldiers while the citizens were starving. My mother couldn\u2019t throw away food; when I opened the freezer, the frozen foods fell off the shelves on my head. I remember I was pressured into eating every last grain of rice otherwise I would have to feel sorry and sinful. At school those kids with lactose intolerance were commonly seen puking up milk.\u201d She adds: \u201cMy parents never taught me to listen to my own feelings and body, and stop eating when I was full. I was just told to eat what you\u2019re given.\u201d But it\u2019s no secret that there is pressure to be slim in Japan. With its small portions of low-calorie foods such as vegetables and oily fish, the country has one of the lowest obesity rates in the world.

This rule was promoted all over the Japan with posters and signs.  Akira says she feels she has to live up to an ideal body image \u2013 the women shown in the media are often very thin. \u201cIn every combini (convenience store) there\u2019s a big magazine rack with anime porn and actual porn, all of it featuring degrading images of women \u2013 half naked, boobs busting out of tiny bikinis, their t-shirts stretching to contain their ample boobs, their knees drawn up to show a tiny triangle of panty,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is total objectification. There are no men being shown this way, only girls and women, in every combini, and that\u2019s just for starters.\u201d Kaiyo says it is \u201cnormal\u201d to be thin in Japan, and failing to fit in to the stereotype can lead to a lack of acceptance from friends and wider society. International relations expert Dr Nancy Snow, from the US, has lived in Tokyo for the past four years. \u201cThere is an obsession here with food because it is so high-quality. Every picture I put up [on social media] of food gets more likes than anything else, we talk about food constantly.\u201d Snow\u2019s analysis of the larger cultural landscape has led her to think the issue could be down to a lack of female empowerment, with women looking for a way to reclaim some control.      It is considered shameful to waste food in Japan. Photograph: Alamy    Snow says that she can understand why people in the country are so reluctant to talk about their issues. \u201cThis is not a place where you are going to admit to any weakness \u2026 it\u2019s also a disease that it not connected to Japanese culture, and is seen as an import, something that has come from somewhere else.\u201d But Japan seems to be waking up to the damaging implications of strict ideals of the perfect body, with a plus-size magazine launching recently. Despite this, far more needs to be done to address eating disorders and the stigma around mental health issues in general. As Hanu puts it: \u201cJapanese people are not so sensitive \u2026 but if you are a sensitive person born into that culture then you get problems. I thought my life was hell when I was a really small kid because of pressure from my parents to work hard after school, and I wanted to kill myself. \u201cWhen someone commits suicide, parents say there was nothing wrong, he was happy and fine; he was good at school,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey never notice anything is wrong until someone dies.\u201d   Some names have been changed.",
