  "body": "Tony Abbott was offered $5,000 cash in an envelope as he was leaving a drinks party hosted by a \u201cwell-known millionaire\u201d when he was a \u201crelatively\u201d new member of parliament.  He made the claim in a speech to parliament on Wednesday. He implied he did not take the cash but was advised to get a cheque made out to the Liberal party as a donation. Abbott also called on the mining industry to \u201cacknowledge and demonstrate their gratitude\u201d to his retiring former minister Ian Macfarlane, who was responsible for the industry portfolio when the mining tax was dumped. His comments regarding Macfarlane sparked an immediate motion in the NSW Upper House by Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham calling for the establishment of a federal anti-corruption body.   Related: Australian political donations 2014-15: search the data    Buckingham flagged a motion to ask the parliament to agree \u201cthat the suggestion by the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, that a major beneficiary of his government\u2019s decision should subsequently reward the responsible minister, Ian Macfarlane, for his work is potentially corrupt and certainly a corruption of the fundamental integrity of our democracy\u201d. Abbott had been paying tribute to his retiring ministers just before 8pm on Wednesday. \u201cThe member from Groom, Ian Macfarlane, was the resources minister who scrapped the mining tax,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThis was the job-destroying, investment-killing tax which did not raise any revenue. It was a magnificent achievement by the member for Groom in his time as minister reborn, as it were. \u201cI hope this sector will acknowledge and demonstrate their gratitude to him in his years of retirement from this place.\u201d   Related: Liberals accepted $25,000 from Linc Energy months after charges over gas leaks    Abbott went on to tell an anecdote about being offered cash in an envelope at the drinks party of a \u201cwell-known millionaire\u201d. Abbott entered the parliament in 1994. \u201cI recall quite some years ago, as a relatively new member of parliament, that a well-known millionaire invited me for a pre-Christmas drink,\u201d Abbott said.  \u201cAs I was leaving he gave me an envelope and said, \u2018That\u2019s your Christmas present.\u2019 When I opened it up it contained $5,000 in cash. I can tell you, the Abbott family in those days could have used that money, but it did not feel right. \u201cI rang Bill Heffernan for his advice and he said: \u2018Once bought, always bought. Give it back and say to that person, \u2018Please write out a cheque for the campaign\u2019.\u201d Buckingham immediately introduced a motion noting Abbott\u2019s comments and calling for \u201cthe establishment of a federal anti-corruption body who can investigate issues such as this\u201d. As prime minister, Abbott\u2019s own code of conduct for his ministers said: \u201cMinisters are required to undertake that, for an 18-month period after ceasing to be a minister, they will not lobby, advocate or have business meetings with members of the government, parliament, public service or defence force on any matters on which they have had official dealings as minister in their last 18 months in office. \u201cMinisters are also required to undertake that, on leaving office, they will not take personal advantage of information to which they have had access as a minister, where that information is not generally available to the public.\u201d Tony Abbott\u2019s office was contacted for comment.",
