  "body": "My theory is that the former British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton has been hacked and is now being run as a parody human. His best counter to an accusation of sexism by Victoria Pendleton was to claim bafflement. After all, Shane explained, he had repeatedly \u201cheld her in my arms in the track centre when she has capitulated\u201d. I\u2019m no sports scientist, but this sounds like cycling-ese for \u201cShe takes just like a woman, yes she does; She makes love just like a woman, yes she does; And she aches just like a woman; But she breaks just like a little girl\u201d. So perhaps it is no surprise that Pendleton this week opted to respond to Sutton in the only language he understands: 1970s Australian. I\u2019m only kidding, of course. Pendleton has, however, accused Sutton of an \u201cemotionally fuelled\u201d decision to drop the sprinter Jess Varnish from the Olympic programme, which would appear to be a mischievous attempt to turn the tables and make him sound flighty and temperamental. Furthermore, Pendleton has felt obliged to explain that any hug didn\u2019t mean what he thought it meant. \u201cApparently he has held me in his arms many times?\u201d she inquired witheringly. \u201cI can tell you, Shane has never thrown his arms around me. I have come off the track and maybe given the coaches a man-hug, but holding me in his arms \u2026\u201d   Related: Shane Sutton accused of \u2018dirty terrorist\u2019 and \u2018bitches\u2019 remarks by British cyclists    Oh dear. Will Shane, who is also alleged to have referred to Paralympic cyclists as \u201cgimps\u201d and \u201cwobblies\u201d, take the deployment of the term \u201cman-hug\u201d lying down? Or will he respond the best way he seems to know how, perhaps coining a term like \u201chugsplain\u201d or \u201chug-tease\u201d? Only time will show. The real sadness, in the meantime, is that we have yet to see a long think-piece in which someone quantifies the \u201cmarginal gains\u201d of working for an obvious arsehole. This seems remiss of the experts. After all, an ever-wider range of sporting variables are now technicalised as being susceptible to marginal gains. Plenty of these make sense, clearly, and there is some interesting research and writing on the matter. However, there is much more that belongs at the intersection of the business books and the mind/body spirit section \u2013 the least appealing coordinates in the airport bookshop. There is also an increasing tendency to chinstroke about marginal gains at the expense of all rational else. The rise of the armchair marginal-gains scientist is as frequently about as welcome as the rise of the \u201cwellness\u201d blogger. If I had to spend the rest of eternity trapped in a lift with an armchair football manager or an armchair marginal-gains scientist, I would take the former in a heartbeat.     Victoria Pendleton shares what she would describe as a man-hug with Shane Sutton after winning gold at the Beijing Olympics, she denies that he consoled her in capitulation. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    Cycling, particularly on these shores, has been at the forefront of the popularisation of the term, epitomised by such innovations as varying intensity warmdowns and Team Sky\u2019s \u201cHead of Winning Behaviours\u201d. So it was no surprise that in the wake of the Varnish story breaking, armchair marginal-gains experts took in their legions to social media to explain that the behaviour of which Sutton stood accused had in some way been crucial to Team GB\u2019s success on the track. But in what way? That appeared to be ineffable. Yet we must hope it will not always be. We stand, after all, on the relative threshold of this exciting area of sports science. In the future, perhaps, a vast body of research will permit us to devise a metric for the benefits of a horrible boss. Given that so many people have at one time or another worked for one, this would certainly seem to be the next lucrative step for the marginal-gains publishing genre. Indeed, I should like to see the various euphemisms for a horrible boss broken down even further, with potential percentage improvement points put on managerial epithets like \u201chard taskmaster\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t suffer fools\u201d and \u201cknows how to push your buttons\u201d. Back at elite level, and tailored to each athlete, I demand the numbers for both \u201carm round the shoulder\u201d and \u201ckick up the backside\u201d. Alternatively, we must consider the possibility that the ongoing fallout from Sutton\u2019s tenure at British Cycling will turn out to be the first step toward tempering the orthodoxy of marginal gains, mercilessly pursued. \u201cMy personal experience was disappointing,\u201d reflected Pendleton this week. \u201cPeople say you need to be hard on people, but by the time you\u2019re at that elite level you are prepared to die and the last thing you need is someone whipping you into shape. No one could have questioned my commitment to the sport, so it would seem rather ridiculous that you would need to push and bully to get the best out of me.\u201d Who knows, maybe the theory of marginal gains is a little like \u201cbroken-windows policing\u201d, the idea that zero tolerance of small crimes leads incrementally but ineluctably to a reduction in serious crimes. In its pomp, this theory was hailed as the answer to winning against urban crime, but over time its limitations have become painfully clear. As The Wire creator David Simon, that long-time student of Baltimore policing and urban decay, has put it: \u201cA broken-windows policy is exactly what it means: the property matters. The people can stay broken till hell freezes over.\u201d",
