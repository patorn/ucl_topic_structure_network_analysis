But there will be no such thing as Worldvision to replace Eurovision, says Jon Ola Sand, the contest\u2019s executive supervisor, putting to rest rumours about the rapid expansion of the hit show. Eurovision has been going big on export. The format has been sold to the Asia Pacific region, China is airing the show for the third year running and, as of this year, 50 million US homes will be able to watch live on the Logo channel following a deal between the European Broadcast Union (EBU) and Viacom. \u201cEurovision is a cultural phenomenon we have admired from afar for years,\u201d says Logo general manager Chris McCarthy. \u201cWe are thrilled to bring the event to US audiences and cheer alongside the rest of the world.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the deal for many years,\u201d explains Jon Ola Sand (EBU first sold the format to the US network in 2006, but nothing came of it). \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to come into the US with products, because the variety of programmes is enormous and also because Eurovision is a very typical European phenomenon with a lot of countries you might not have heard of in the US, so it\u2019s also difficult to explain what it is. But they are very happy at Viacom that this agreement is now in place \u2013 and so are we.\u201d     Singin\u2019 in the rain \u2026 Belarus\u2019 Ivan performs in the 2016 semi-final.

Matt Friedrichs, US-based editor of the Eurovision news site ESC United, has been lobbying broadcasters to air the contest for years. \u201cI could not be more thrilled,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough technically everyone has access to the internet, only a tiny, tiny percentage of people in America would bother going online to watch the live stream.\u201d He says it has been hard to convince Americans to watch a competition they are not taking part in, but that interest is growing \u2013 even President Obama mentioned Eurovision in a recent address to the people of Europe in Hannover, Germany, making the case that, even though we vote for different singers at Eurovision, Europe should remain united.

Photograph: Jonathan Pow/PA    \u201cHopefully with all the changes coming up \u2013 us broadcasting it, Justin Timberlake performing \u2013 those are important first steps that we can build on ... and it\u2019s the right channel to do so,\u201d says Friedrichs. Sand says Timberlake\u2019s performance will not be aired in the US due to a lack of rights but agrees that Logo \u2013 the country\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender TV channel \u2013 is a good match. He says, however, that the channel\u2019s LGBT demographic was not a dealbreaker: \u201cWe know we have a lot of fans in that community and that is appreciated, but that was not a factor in the deal. Having said that, it fits very well on that channel and towards an audience that could appreciate Eurovision.\u201d Simon Bennett is the president of OGAE, the world\u2019s biggest Eurovision fan organisation, and he says they too have seen growing interest from the US. But he is apprehensive, calling the decision to welcome Australia to take part in 2015 and again this year \u201ccontroversial\u201d and that expansion is a \u201ctouchy subject\u201d.

Photograph: Nikolai Linares/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cI think it\u2019s because it\u2019s kind of ours ... it\u2019s something that belongs to all of us in Europe, that we share,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cWhile it\u2019s great that American audiences are going to see it, will that mean they take the next logical step?\u201d he asks, referring to speculation that the US might be invited to join Eurovision next year.   Related: Eurovision song contest: share your favourite memories    The question is not unfounded. In 2014, the interval act was Australian pop star Jessica Mauboy \u2013 and the next year saw Australia participating. This year it\u2019s Timberlake, so can we expect to see the USA on scoreboards in 2017? Sand laughs when asked. \u201cNo I don\u2019t think so, and for a very simple reason: we need a domestic audience in order to bring in an act from a country outside Europe. They need to build an audience in the US. If you remember Australia and the arguments we had when we invited them \u2013 they have broadcast the show for more than 30 years, they have a huge fan base. So no, there is for the time being no discussions of bringing other countries to the contest. But this could change.\u201d Change is far from a new concept in the contest, which has always evolved. This year, there is an updated voting system and new countries, such as Azerbaijan, have been introduced in the past. The inclusion of the US, however, would be considered a step too far for many. \u201cPeople are probably scared \u2013 \u2018Oh big America we are going to send Katy Perry and Usher and all our big stars,\u2019\u201d says Friedrichs. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it is \u2013 it\u2019s just spreading the word.\u201d      Moldovan hopefuls Zdob si Zdub pull out all the stops in 2011\u2019s contest. Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reurters    \u201cUs fans are probably a bit selfish,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cWe don\u2019t want word getting out too much: it\u2019s our little secret and the more people know about, the more pressure there will be to get tickets.\u201d Still, Bennett isn\u2019t worried the show will be Americanised. \u201cFor 60 years we have been enjoying this contest. It was an integral part of bringing west and east Europe together and I think it always will be that and it\u2019s something that all us Europeans share. We are happy to share it with other countries, but perhaps not to broaden it too much or dilute its European content.\u201d           Ukraine\u2019s 2016 Eurovision entry is song about Russian repression    According to Sand, fans need not fear: \u201cThe Eurovision song contest as such will always be staged in Europe and it\u2019s a very European thing \u2013 but it\u2019s good to sometimes be able to say: \u2018Hey look, we\u2019ve got a thing going here\u2019 and invite broadcasters in territories that have huge followings.\u201d Is the EBU hoping to ultimately turn Eurovision into a worldwide competition? \u201cWe are not looking at a sort of \u2018Worldvision\u2019 because that\u2019s too complicated, simply because of time zones and the different broadcasting setups in different regions,\u201d says Sand. \u201cEurovision is very much built around public service in Europe and on the strong commitment that if you win it you host it.\u201d As for what happens if Australia wins, Sand says they have a plan. \u201cI don\u2019t want to reveal which broadcaster will cooperate with SBS Australia to host it in Europe, but it will be hosted in Europe. We have an agreement in place.\u201d What US viewers will think of Saturday\u2019s grand final remains to be seen.",
