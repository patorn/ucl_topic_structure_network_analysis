  "body": "A celebrated Swedish illustrator has spoken out after being asked by his publisher to change \u201cstereotypical depictions of other cultures\u201d in his popular children\u2019s books. Jan L\u00f6\u00f6f, who won the Astrid Lindgren prize in 2011 \u201cfor meritorious authorship within the realm of Swedish literature for children and youth\u201d, told Swedish paper Dagens Nyheter this week that his publisher Bonnier Carlsen had asked him to change images in two of his books, Morfar \u00e4r sj\u00f6r\u00f6vare (Grandpa Is a Pirate) and Ta fast Fabian (Catch Fabian). The first title, which was published in 1966, sees a boy and his grandfather set out to steal the treasure of an evil pirate named Omar, while the second features an image of a man in a tribal costume. L\u00f6\u00f6f told Dagens Nyheter that he had been given an ultimatum \u2013 either change certain illustrations in the books or they would be pulled from sale. \u201cI am 76 years old and cannot be bothered to change. It\u2019s not about the money for me. But I probably won\u2019t do any more picture books for children,\u201d he told the paper, adding that the drummer in tribal wear was modelled on an old friend. \u201cI know that he would be flattered. He was a very handsome man.\u201d Bonnier Carlsen denies the claim it has cancelled the books, telling Dagens Nyheter that it is \u201cnot yet clear\u201d whether the books will be kept in stock. In a statement, literary director Eva Dahlin said the issue was \u201ccomplex\u201d, and that the publisher had recently discussed with L\u00f6\u00f6f whether there were any images in his books \u201cthat could be perceived as stereotypical depictions of other cultures\u201d. \u201cOur starting point is that our books will have an inclusive perspective and not reproduce prejudices,\u201d she said. \u201cAll classics age. All books are a product of their time \u2026 As an adult, perhaps this is not a problem and one manages to place the work in its historical context, but the question is whether we can expect the same of our children.\u201d   Related: The real censorship in children's books: smiling slaves is just the half of it    While some have called the debate ridiculous and others have pointed to censorship, Dahlin said it was \u201cimportant to be able to have this discussion intelligently. Because it is important. And the question is difficult. Either stop selling a beloved classic, or risk our children\u2019s books repeating prejudices to young readers.\u201d She expressed the hope that Bonnier Carlsen and L\u00f6\u00f6f would find a solution to the situation. \u201cFor me the issue is bigger than these specific books,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we as publishers, in a respectful way, manage our cultural heritage and at the same time adhere to contemporary value and have children\u2019s best interests at heart.\u201d",
