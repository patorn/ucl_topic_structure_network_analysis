Related: Seven in 10 Australians think the government should do more to help refugees    In a global survey of 27,000 people across 27 countries, nearly 70% said their governments should being doing more to help refugees, while 80% said they would accept refugees living in their country, city, or neighbourhood. One in 10 would welcome a refugee to live in their own home, with the figure rising to 46% in China and 29% in the UK.  China and the UK were first and third respectively on Amnesty\u2019s Refugees Welcome Index, with Germany in second place.    Refugees welcome index   In Germany, a country that received 1.1 million asylum seekers in 2015, almost every respondent (96%) said they would accept refugees in their country, while only 3% said refugees should be refused entry. And 76% of German respondents said their government should be doing more to assist refugees. Of UK respondents:   84% agreed that \u201cpeople should be able to take refuge in other countries to escape war or persecution\u201d. 7o% believed the government should do more to help refugees fleeing war or persecution. 82% would welcome refugees living in their city, town, or village. 76% would welcome refugees living in their neighbourhood. 29% would welcome refugees living in their own home.    Would you accept refugees into your home   In many cases the response of people appears at odds with their country\u2019s political culture, such as in Australia, which is fifth on Amnesty\u2019s index.  While the country has hardline policies towards people seeking asylum on its shores, including mandatory and sometimes indefinite detention in remote island camps overseas, seven in 10 people believe the country should do more to help people displaced by war or persecution.

Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP    The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, claimed, in the midst of an election campaign this week, that Australia could not accept more refugees because most were what he described as uneducated, illiterate, and would take Australian jobs or be a drain on the welfare system. \u201cFor many people, they won\u2019t be, you know, numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English. These people would be taking Australian jobs, there\u2019s no question about that. For many of them that would be unemployed, they would languish in unemployment queues and on Medicare.\u201d Dutton\u2019s own department commissioned a report which found refugees make valuable economic and social contributions to Australia. \u201cThe research found the overwhelming picture ... is one of considerable achievement and contribution,\u201d the department said in its own summation of the findings.   Should people be able to take refuge in other countries to escape from war or persecution?   The overwhelming majority \u2013 86% \u2013 of the world\u2019s refugees do not live in industrialised nations, but are hosted in developing countries, usually close to the one they fled. In those countries, attitudes to asylum seekers are overwhelmingly positive, according to the Amnesty research. In Jordan, a country that already hosts 650,000 Syrian refugees, 84% of people believe their government should do more to assist refugees fleeing war or persecution. A quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population are refugees and 69% of that country\u2019s citizens believe their government should do more to assist.    Should your government do more to help refugees fleeing war or persecution?   \u201cThese figures speak for themselves,\u201d said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general. \u201cPeople are ready to make refugees welcome, but governments\u2019 inhumane responses to the refugee crisis are badly out of touch with their own citizens\u2019. \u201cThe Refugees Welcome Index exposes the shameful way governments have played short-term politics with the lives of people fleeing war and repression.

Too often they use xenophobic anti-refugee rhetoric to chase approval ratings. This survey suggests they are not listening to the silent majority of welcoming citizens who take the refugee crisis personally.\u201d National leaders and delegates will meet at the UN-convened world humanitarian summit in Istanbul next week, where countries are expected to make commitments to resettle more refugees, particularly those displaced by ongoing conflict in the Middle East.",
