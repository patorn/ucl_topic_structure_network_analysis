  "body": "Few electoral shocks were expected in Scotland and Wales on Thursday. A big win for the Scottish National party and another solid winning performance by Welsh Labour had been widely predicted. Both things duly occurred. But not quite in the way the polls suggested. Both elections, in Scotland in particular, also produced real surprises too. The headline story in Scotland is the SNP\u2019s success in winning a third successive term in government. With 63 of the 129 Holyrood seats in their corner, and their opponents divided, the SNP\u2019s ascendancy has won a renewed mandate. It is a formidable achievement. It represents a continuing reward as much for political brilliance as for good government, where the SNP\u2019s record is very much open to challenge. But the SNP has also been dented. Nicola Sturgeon will lead a minority government now, not the majority government she inherited in 2014 from Alex Salmond. On a reduced turnout, the SNP\u2019s share of the vote slipped from 50% in the UK general election to 46.5% in the constituency section and 42% in the regional list this time. These are commanding shares, but they suggest that the SNP may have peaked. Ms Sturgeon has been given food for thought. Considering the SNP\u2019s long run of success, this is a refreshing and necessary development in what has begun to seem a bit like a one-party state. True, with Green support, there is still a majority at Holyrood for independence, but the chances of a second independence referendum in Scotland before 2021 have dimmed this week. The SNP may aspire to leading Scotland to independence, but it has been elected to go on fighting Scotland\u2019s corner within the union, now armed with the \u201cdevo-more\u201d powers that followed the first referendum. Its task now is to govern. A halfway house will frustrate many hardliners in the SNP, and may mean trouble from the grassroots for Ms Sturgeon eventually. It had become lazily fashionable over the last couple of decades to say that Scotland was a Tory-free zone. But the Scots Tories never went away altogether. The charismatic Ruth Davidson has now led the party to twice as many Holyrood seats as in 2011 and becomes the principal opposition. This will change the dynamic of Holyrood. Meanwhile the once-mighty Labour has been pushed into third place after a near wipeout by the SNP in the west. There looks to be no quick way back for Labour, or perhaps even any way back at all. Much will depend both on the SNP and on Labour\u2019s credibility in England. Labour\u2019s continued success in Wales will help. Although the party lost votes in Wales on Thursday and is now two seats short of overall control in Cardiff Bay, it remains the most formidable force in Welsh politics and it is not seriously threatened by a nationalist alternative on Scottish lines. Labour\u2019s bigger worry, in Wales as in England, remains Ukip\u2019s ability to eat into its traditional vote. These Scottish and Welsh elections were not freak or peripheral events. With a grassroots \u201cpeople before profits\u201d campaigner shaking up the Northern Ireland assembly contest by topping the poll in traditionally Republican west Belfast and the D\u00e1il finally voting to approve a fragile Fine Gael-led minority government in the Irish Republic, this week\u2019s elections have produced a new set of reminders that politics across these islands have become more volatile and march to many different drums.",
