In one clutch of show gardens, the naturalism (in Chelsea parlance, a borrowed or captured landscape) of all those frothy plants has morphed into another type of landscape: the dry garden. We\u2019re talking scree, gravel, drought-resistant plants: this year, Hugo Bugg\u2019s Royal Bank Of Canada garden and Andy Sturgeon\u2019s Telegraph garden were the standouts. But elsewhere, the froth of the meadow had an injection of riotous colour and an exuberant \u201ceverything plus the kitchen sink\u201d approach to planting. Ann-Marie Powell\u2019s RHS Greening Grey Britain garden epitomised the trend, with its bright orange shipping container of an outdoor room, echoing the bright orange geums among purple alliums; see also Diarmuid Gavin\u2019s riotous planting in his Harrods British Eccentrics garden. 2 Pines replace topiary     Dwarf mountain pines featured in Sam Ovens\u2019 Cloudy Bay Garden. Photograph: Neil Hepworth/RHS    Tightly clipped topiary, in boxes, balls or hedges, was once everywhere at Chelsea, but not this year (apart from Gavin\u2019s garden, where it was taken up to \u2013 and possibly beyond \u2013 the limit, with an avenue of conical clipped bay trees that twirl on the spot every few minutes). What took its place? Native trees, particularly pines, in a more relaxed style. My favourites were the dense, grey-green of the glaucous Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris \u2018Glauca\u2019) in Nick Bailey\u2019s Winton\u2019s Beauty Of Mathematics garden, and Sam Ovens\u2019 looser, less controlled dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) in the Cloudy Bay garden (right down to a broken branch on the ground; Ovens had to keep stopping people from tidying it away). 3 Small is beautiful     The Senri-Sentei garage garden designed by Kazuyuki Ishihara. Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images    The smallest gardens at Chelsea (the artisan gardens) are often the most desirable for the average punter. The garden I\u2019d like to take home this year is the Senri-Sentei garage garden, created by Japanese designer Kazuyuki Ishihara. It\u2019s cute, compact and beautiful, with a haze of colourful Japanese acers festooning the rooftop garden that shelters a vintage Mini. 4 Lawns rule     The Chelsea Barracks garden, designed by Jo Thompson. Photograph: Neil Hepworth/RHS    To anyone unacquainted with the mores of Chelsea, the idea that a lawn might be controversial must seem very odd: after all, it\u2019s a central feature of most British plots. But Jo Thompson\u2019s Chelsea Barracks garden, billed as a rose garden reimagined for the 21st century, contains a sizable green sward rarely seen at the show these days. 5 Stone walls     James Basson\u2019s L\u2019\u0092Occitane garden features drystone walls. Photograph: Neil Hepworth/RHS    If there\u2019s a theme to the hard landscaping this year, it\u2019s rough-hewn stone: it came in boulders and as drystone walls in Cleve West\u2019s M&G garden; as gabion walls in Rosy Hardy\u2019s Brewin Dolphin Forever Freefolk garden, and drystone walls in the Provence landscape of James Basson\u2019s L\u2019Occitane garden. As a trend, it\u2019s an unusually accessible one. Get yourself on a drystone wall course this summer and you could have built your own by Christmas. 6 The medium is the message     The Modern Slavery garden designed by Juliet Sargeant. Photograph: Sarah Cuttle/RHS    Garden sponsorship makes for odd bedfellows: while some designers are bankrolled by investment funds, others are sponsored by charities with a serious message. Can a garden make people think a little harder about Ebola or meningitis? I don\u2019t know, but with 165,000 visitors passing through the showground last week and millions more watching on TV around the world, you can see why they try. The Modern Slavery garden by Chelsea first-timer Juliet Sargeant is notable for its powerful message; at the centre of the garden is an English oak, symbolising the tree where William Wilberforce stood when he dedicated his life to ending slavery. 7 It\u2019s a fair copper     A copper water bowl in Nick Bailey\u2019s Beauty of Mathematics garden. Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock    The interior decorating trend for coppery tones has been picked up in both planting and objects: see the wonderful copper water bowl by sculptor Giles Rayner in Nick Bailey\u2019s garden, the orange isoplexis in Andy Sturgeon\u2019s garden.  8 Lupin love     Blue lupin (Lupinus pilosus) growing in its native Jordan. Photograph: Alamy    Every year, there are a few plants in the show gardens that everyone wants to grow immediately. For me, it was the gorgeous, navy-blue lupins (Lupinus pilosus) in Bugg\u2019s garden. Not only are its blooms stunning, the plant is drought-tolerant and a nitrogen fixer. 9 Spotty Dotty     Podophyllum \u2018Spotty Dotty\u2019. Photograph: Alamy    Away from the glare and glamour of the show gardens, the pavilion is simply all about the plants. Of all the delights of its nursery exhibits, one plant calls out to me every year: Podophyllum \u2018Spotty Dotty\u2019, with mottled umbrella-like leaves and wine-red flowers. Perhaps it\u2019s finally the year to give it a go. 10 Bins can be beautiful, too     Woven compost bins in Ann-Marie Powell\u2019s garden. Photograph: Jane Perrone    Even composting has a place at Chelsea. If there was one thing I wanted to steal from this year\u2019s show, it was Powell\u2019s wonderful cylindrical woven willow compost bins made by Staffordshire basketmaker Eddie Glew. With these beauties, you wouldn\u2019t want to hide your composting in a corner. \u2022 Go to theguardian.com/chelsea-flower-show for more pictures and all our Chelsea coverage.",
