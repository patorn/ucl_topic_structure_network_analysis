  "body": "I\u2019m the older sister. Growing up, neither my brother nor I had a great childhood because of the domestic abuse, child abuse and anger issues in the family. It was quite difficult and has affected me as an adult. Since attending therapy, I realise that I want to reconnect with my brother.\u00a0 I have resented him because my mother used favouritism as a part of the abuse. She still does treat him preferentially to me, but I want to move past this and try to have a normal relationship.\u00a0 We\u2019re in our 20s and neither of us is very friendly with the other. We never talk or even call or visit. As far as he\u2019s concerned, he doesn\u2019t have a sister \u2013 I\u2019m just someone who lives \u201cup north\u201d. I struggled with seeing him too because the last time he did visit before we stopped talking he was so rude and dismissive of my ex-partner that we ended up having a fight. I think the way he acts is because my mother was much less critical of his behaviour and more patient with him. He \u201cgot away with it\u201d. Part of this is because he might have undiagnosed Asperger\u2019s. Yet I often felt, when my mum would physically punish me rather than him, that this was an excuse my mother used to hurt me more.\u00a0 Over a year in which I have tried to make an effort, such as buying tickets for events or organising a meal or trip, he always turns me down or stops replying. He says things like, he doesn\u2019t want to go and purposefully hurtful things, such as he has better things to do. I understand there is hate on his part, as well, for what happened when I couldn\u2019t protect him, but I\u2019m starting to get tired of trying and wasting money when he cancels.\u00a0 You\u2019ve had a lot to deal with. Some people don\u2019t look back and realise what\u2019s happened in their family till much later and yet here you are, in your 20s, already incredibly self-aware.And you have sought therapy, which is fantastic. There are also organisations, such as Napac (napac.org.uk) that provide helplines and local support groups, should you find that useful. I contacted Nicola McCarry, a psychotherapist (aft.org.uk) who deals with families in situations such as yours. I asked what it might have been like growing up in such a household and she says that you and your brother \u201cmay have felt it was your fault [the abuse and general situation], as children, and felt responsible or to blame.\u201d You weren\u2019t, of course, but children tend to internalise and think everything is their fault. I think this blame may have stayed with you both into adulthood. I wondered about your line \u201csome hate on his part \u2026 when I couldn\u2019t protect him\u201d, because it sounds as if you did protect him. \u201cSometimes,\u201d explains McCarry, \u201cthe older child may try and draw some of the fire [away from the younger]\u201d. I wondered if your brother felt he hadn\u2019t protected you. Also, being \u201cthe favourite\u201d isn\u2019t always a hallowed place to be. The favoured child can often see the injustice, but is powerless to do anything about it. Your brother also had to see you being physically punished, which would have been fairly traumatising for him. Not to mention how traumatising it was \u2013 and still is \u2013 for you. Growing up in such a household would, as McCarry explains, have \u201caffected your sense of security; your secure base was threatened. To thrive, we need to feel safe, safe to go out and explore with the confidence that security gives us, and then be able to return home and say if something bad happened.\u201d You didn\u2019t have that. I wondered how you would feel if you knew, somehow, that your brother was hurt and wanted to reconnect, but yet still acted the way he did. However, you can only do so much. \u201cYou could contact him \u2013 an email or a letter,\u201d suggests McCarry, \u201cand say something like: \u2018I would love to have an adult relationship with you [crucially, away from your mother]. These are the things I regret [if there is anything] \u2026 are there things about me you want to discuss?\u2019 However, you can only do this up to a point because otherwise you are perpetuating the abusive family relationship.\u201d In other words, you can\u2019t keep knocking at his door if he is vile to you. You can offer him a grownup, loving sibling relationship \u2013 but you can\u2019t make it happen. \u201cYou do make yourself vulnerable [by doing this],\u201d says McCarry. \u201cBut you need to release that power [which he seems to have] and, actually, in making yourself vulnerable, that\u2019s a very strong thing to do.\u201d Remember, she continues, \u201cIf you were to decide that there isn\u2019t a future with him, some people make a \u2018family of choice\u2019 with people who aren\u2019t blood kin.\u201d I\u2019m really sorry you had such a difficult start to life, but you do sound as if you are on the road to making a life that\u2019s worthy of you now. If your brother chooses to join you, that\u2019s up to him. Your problems solved Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.
