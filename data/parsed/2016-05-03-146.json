Related: The 5,000-1 payouts on Leicester only tell part of Premier League betting story | Greg Wood    The coach, carrying some of the club\u2019s first-team squad and owners, sounded its horn as it was chased by throngs of flag-waving fans. It then stopped and a club official beckoned Lee Chapman, a postman who has found unexpected fame as a doppelganger of Vardy, his favourite player. Speaking to the Guardian minutes before he was whisked away, Chapman said he was \u201clost for words\u201d at his side\u2019s momentous season. \u201cI\u2019ve not slept. I went in for work at 6.30am and ran my round so I could be here outside the stadium. I\u2019m still supposed to be at work now,\u201d he said. Chapman, a lifelong Leicester fan who at 29 and 5ft 10in is the same age and height as Vardy, was talent-spotted as a lookalike outside the club\u2019s stadium eight months ago. Since then he has been snapped up by a Channel 4 documentary, appeared on Sky\u2019s Soccer AM and, of course, taken thousands of selfies with fans.       \u201cI\u2019m not even a confident lad. I\u2019m lost for words at the fact Leicester have won. I\u2019m a Leicester-born, Leicester-raised, Leicester fan,\u201d he said. The club\u2019s shop had run out of replica shirts by just after midday, as hundreds of fans descended on the stadium to carry on the party.",
