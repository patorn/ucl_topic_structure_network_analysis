We still have feelings for each other, but things were going in different directions for us, and he was unable to adapt to\u00a0what\u00a0my career might mean for our relationship. We are trying to remain friends, but whenever we meet up, we usually end up being physical. Despite having both\u00a0agreed that breaking up is for the best, and\u00a0that it would be unfair on both of us to continue our relationship, I am finding it hard to\u00a0convince my heart of that. How can I\u00a0reduce what we had to just friendship?If you and your ex truly want to transition into being just friends \u2013 which can be virtually impossible for some people, especially if one or both of you carry any kind of torch, or if the reasons for splitting up were traumatic \u2013 there are a few ways to navigate that gracefully. One approach that has worked for me in the past is to make sure you have time apart, to allow your bodies to withdraw from each other: you need a\u00a0period away from the habitual embraces, intimacies, interactions, conversations, shared jokes and\u00a0physicality that\u00a0existed between you. Your bodies and brains have become used to each other\u2019s smells, touch, tastes, humour. Being\u00a0intimate can be a hard habit to break, especially when you split up for reasons such as career or bad timing. Taking a step away from each other will give you both the space to grieve, to forge new relationships and to nurture friendships new and old. This isn\u2019t just a pause in the relationship \u2013 you must see it as a full break, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to move forward. This might take months or even years. Once the real grieving has happened in full, there might still be a friendship to re-establish. Often, however, even after all that time out, it still won\u2019t work. Sometimes, no chemistry remains, other times there is too much.   Related: Ask Alanis Morissette: how can I stop drinking so much?    If you are committed to moving on, take some time to\u00a0reset. Only after doing so can you get a sense of whether you actually want to have some semblance of a friendship with your ex. It\u2019s likely, though, that the chemistry (or lack thereof) will be the deciding factor in how that develops, as well as any new relationships that either or both of you establish. \u2022 Alanis Morissette\u2019s podcast is available on iTunes and at alanis.com.
