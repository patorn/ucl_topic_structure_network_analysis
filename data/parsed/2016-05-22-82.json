The account of John Crane, a former senior Pentagon investigator, appears to undermine Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other major establishment figures who argue that there were established routes for Snowden other than leaking to the media.  Crane, a longtime assistant inspector general at the Pentagon, has accused his old office of retaliating against a major surveillance whistleblower, Thomas Drake, in an episode that helps explain Snowden\u2019s 2013 National Security Agency disclosures. Not only did Pentagon officials provide Drake\u2019s name to criminal investigators, Crane told the Guardian, they destroyed documents relevant to his defence.  Snowden, responding to Crane\u2019s revelations, said he had tried to raise his concerns with colleagues, supervisors and lawyers and been told by all of them: \u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire.\u201d     Edward Snowden is calling for \u2018iron-clad\u2019 protections for whistleblowers. Photograph: Lotta Hardelin/AFP/Getty Images    He told the Guardian: \u201cWe need iron-clad, enforceable protections for whistleblowers, and we need a public record of success stories. Protect the people who go to members of Congress with oversight roles, and if their efforts lead to a positive change in policy \u2013 recognize them for their efforts. There are no incentives for people to stand up against an agency on the wrong side of the law today, and that\u2019s got to change.\u201d Snowden continued: \u201cThe sad reality of today\u2019s policies is that going to the inspector general with evidence of truly serious wrongdoing is often a mistake. Going to the press involves serious risks, but at least you\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d Financially ruined Thomas Drake\u2019s legal ordeal ruined him financially and ended in 2011 with all serious accusations against him dropped. His case served as a prologue to Snowden\u2019s. Now Crane\u2019s account has led to a new investigation at the US justice department into whistleblower retaliation at the Pentagon that may serve as an epilogue \u2013 one Crane hopes will make the Pentagon a safe place for insiders to expose wrongdoing and illegality.  \u201cIf we have situations where we have whistleblowers investigated because they\u2019re whistleblowers to the inspector general\u2019s office, that will simply shut down the whole whistleblower system,\u201d Crane told the Guardian. Crane, who has not previously given interviews, has told his explosive story in a new book, Bravehearts: Whistle Blowing In The Age of Snowden by Mark Hertsgaard, from which the Guardian is running extracts. The Guardian has partnered with Der Spiegel and Newsweek Japan on Crane\u2019s story.     Thomas Drake\u2019s legal ordeal ruined him financially. Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images    \u201cWhen someone becomes a whistleblower, they\u2019re making a serious, conscious decision,\u201d Crane said.  \u201cThey\u2019re making a decision that can change their lives, change their futures, impact family life, too. There needs to be this certain unbreakable trust. Confidentiality is that trust and that can\u2019t ever be violated.\u201d Snowden cited Drake\u2019s case as a reason for his lack of faith in the government\u2019s official whistleblower channels.  \u201cWhen I was at NSA, everybody knew that for anything more serious than workplace harassment, going through the official process was a career-ender at best. It\u2019s part of the culture,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian. \u201cIf your boss in the mailroom lies on his timesheets, the IG might look into it. But if you\u2019re Thomas Drake, and you find out the president of the United States ordered the warrantless wiretapping of everyone in the country, what\u2019s the IG going to do? They\u2019re going to flush it, and you with it.\u201d While Drake\u2019s case is well known in US national security circles, its internal history is not.  Major source In 2002, Drake and NSA colleagues contacted the Pentagon inspector general to blow the whistle on an expensive and poorly performing tool, Trailblazer, for mass-data analysis. Crane, head of the office\u2019s whistleblower unit, assigned investigators. For over two years, with Drake as a major source, they acquired thousands of pages of documents, classified and unclassified, and prepared a lengthy secret report in December 2004 criticizing Trailblazer, eventually helping to kill the program. As far as Crane was concerned, the whistleblower system was working. But after an aspect of the NSA\u2019s warrantless mass surveillance leaked to the New York Times, Drake himself came under investigation and eventually indictment. Drake was suspected of hoarding documentation \u2013 exactly what inspector-general investigators tell their whistleblowers to do.  \u201cThey made it clear to keep [documents] wherever possible, and obviously properly handle anything that was classified,\u201d Drake remembered. Crane feared that his own colleagues had told the FBI about Drake. He suspected the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s lead attorney, Henry Shelley, whom Crane said had earlier suggested working with the justice department about the leak, had done so. A confrontation yielded what Crane considered to be evasions.  \u201cThe top lawyer would not reveal to me whether or not Drake\u2019s confidentiality had been compromised or not. That was a concern \u2026 Normally I expect direct answers,\u201d Crane said.  When Drake\u2019s attorneys sought potentially exculpatory information from the inspector general\u2019s office, they learned that much of it had been \u201cdestroyed before the defendant was charged, pursuant to a standard document destruction policy\u201d, according to a 2011 letter from prosecutors.  Crane was livid. All relevant regulations mandated keeping the documents, not destroying them. But a high-ranking colleague, Lynne Halbrooks, prevented Crane from investigating the document destruction. He suspected Shelley and Halbrooks of sacrificing a whistleblower and misleading the justice department and a federal judge, all in a case centering around the cover-up of NSA bulk surveillance. Forced out Crane\u2019s relationship with his superiors spiraled downward until they forced him out in 2013, months before Snowden\u2019s revelations. The next year, he filed a complaint with a federal agency that works with whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel. In March this year, it found a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s office improperly destroyed the Drake documents and arranged, with Pentagon consent, for the justice department inspector general to investigate. Shelley, still the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s senior counsel, declined to answer questions but said he was \u201ccertain my name will be cleared\u201d by the new investigation. Halbrooks, the Office of Special Counsel and the justice department inspector general declined to comment for this story. Bridget Serchak, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon inspector general, noted that her office and the Office of Special Counsel jointly requested the justice department investigation.  \u201cIt is important to point out that there has been no determination on the allegations, and it is unfair to characterize the allegations otherwise at this point. DoD OIG will cooperate fully with the DoJ OIG\u2019s investigation of this matter and looks forward to the results of that investigation,\u201d Serchak said.  Crane considers this latest inquiry a bellwether for whether the whistleblower system can reform itself in a post-Snowden era. \u201cSnowden responded to the way Drake was handled. The Office of Special Council investigation regarding destruction of possibly exculpatory documents regarding Drake might be the end of this saga,\u201d Crane said.",
