For the last 15 years, the fund has focused on alleviating poverty in the developing world by investing in businesses that operate at the bottom of the pyramid, like solar-light manufacturer D.light and Burn, which makes and sells cookstoves in East Africa.    Related: America's poorest white town: abandoned by coal, swallowed by drugs    Since the former Wall Street banker Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen\u2019s chief executive, started the fund in 2001, it has raised more than $100m in charitable donations to invest in enterprises addressing poverty in Africa, South Asia and Latin America. Now, the fund is unexpectedly turning its attention closer to home. Acumen America aims to tackle the \u201cglaring inequality\u201d in the US, according to Novogratz.  Its first two portfolio companies are WorkAmerica, a technology platform that connects community college students to employers, and Healthify, which enables healthcare providers in low income communities to fully address the needs of their patients. \u201cWe started Acumen to change the way the world tackled poverty,\u201d said Novogratz. \u201cWe say the opposite of poverty is not income. It\u2019s dignity. We define it increasingly as opportunity, freedom [and] choice.\u201d  Nearly 15% of Americans fall below the poverty line, which is set at about $24,000 a year for a family of four. While Acumen has previously focused on global poverty, Novogratz and Catherine Casey Nanda, director of Acumen America, said low income Americans have pressing needs too. \u201cRelative poverty can be as crushing as absolute poverty, on some levels,\u201d Nanda said. Historically, foundations have helped the disadvantaged by granting money to nonprofits to provide social services. But now, some are supporting for profit businesses with grants, loans or investments, often designed to create jobs. One of the first to do so was the Northwest Area Foundation, which has invested (or committed to invest) about $30m in around 20 companies, mostly with the aim of creating jobs in low income urban or rural areas. Its investments helped generate \u201camazing job growth through a period when jobs nationally were being destroyed\u201d, according to Amy Jensen, the foundation\u2019s investment director. More recently, Washington DC-based nonprofit Living Cities raised $31m from 10 foundations and commercial investors for the Blended Catalyst Fund. This initiative will invest in businesses and nonprofits that focus on \u201ceconomic development, income inequality, small business development, homelessness and similar issues\u201d. The FB Heron Foundation invests its endowment of nearly $300m \u201cin ways that expand reliable employment and economic opportunity for those on the margins\u201d. The Annie E Casey Foundation sets aside $125m from its endowment for mission investing, which has been used to support affordable housing and small business. Acumen America is much smaller with just $7m to invest, funded by grants from the Hitachi Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Barclays. While it wants its investments to create jobs, its broader purpose is to support businesses that deliver goods and services to low income customers. It will make early stage investments across three sectors \u2013 health, workforce development and financial services. Most US entrepreneurs start companies \u201cto solve problems for a client base that can afford them\u201d, Novogratz said. \u201cOne of the challenges is how to get more entrepreneurs to focus on, not improving lives for the wealthy, but solving some of the big social issues of our time.\u201d  Its health investments are being financed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The investment in Healthify, a Baltimore-based startup that supports hospitals and clinics to connect patients to social services, reflects the fact that \u201chealthcare by itself isn\u2019t going to help the most vulnerable get better\u201d, according to Lori Melichar, director of the pioneer portfolio at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Future investments could go to companies that provide healthy foods or improve social cohesion in poor neighborhoods, she said.

Collin Gutman, the founder and CEO, says: \u201cTo the schools, we look like an outsourced placement office. To the companies, we look like a LinkedIn for the middle skills or the skilled trades.\u201d Companies pay to find skilled workers; there\u2019s no cost to the community colleges or students. Acumen would also like to invest in companies that provide financial services to low income and unbanked Americans. Nanda says: \u201cWe see a real opportunity to rethink traditional business models like payday lending or check cashing.\u201d Taking a business-friendly approach to poverty alleviation has won Acumen friends across the political spectrum.  \u201cWe have some investors who are part of the (libertarian) Cato institute, and we have some investors who are much more liberal,\u201d Novogratz said. \u201cMarkets play a really powerful role as a listening device. They give customers a voice in a way that charity and typical government welfare does not.\u201d",
