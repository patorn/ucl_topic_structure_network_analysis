She stole Bridesmaids, and Judd Apatow\u2019s This Is 40, with a bracingly foul-mouthed cameo. And now she has four box-office hits under her belt, a near-unbroken run from Identity Thief through to The Boss.   Related: Melissa McCarthy fights off critics, Batman and Superman to top US box office    The latter, though, suggests that McCarthy\u2019s inspiration may well have dried up. It might be her worst movie yet \u2013 besides the unfocused, unfunny Tammy, which, like The Boss, was co-written and directed by McCarthy\u2019s husband Ben Falcone. McCarthy has workshopped up a great character to build a movie around. It\u2019s just that the movie itself never shows up. The boss in question, Michelle Darnell, is a worst-case-scenario blend of home-maker Martha Stewart and motivational speaker Tony Robbins, an apple-cheeked egomaniac averse to criticism and fast with her fists. Jailed for insider trading and broke upon release, she imposes herself on her long-suffering personal assistant Claire (Kristin Bell) and embarks upon a vicious Girl Scout cookie trade war using Claire\u2019s daughter\u2019s troop.            There\u2019s an impressive arsenal of strong players including Kathy Bates, Kristen Schaal and Peter Dinklage as Michelle\u2019s primary antagonist, but none get more than a moment or two to shine before the mediocrity and shrillness kick back in. Slo-mo, comically violent action movie-style punch-ups between Girl Scout packs, and McCarthy\u2019s inspired scorning of Bell\u2019s granny-bra do not compensate for what is otherwise a tonally incoherent mess. It\u2019s perhaps funnier than recent comedies like Horrible Bosses, Trainwreck and Hot Pursuit but, come on, how impressive is that?   Related: The making of Melissa McCarthy: how Bridesmaids star kept it real and cleaned up    There\u2019s a pattern here. Bridesmaids, The Heat, with Sandra Bullock, and Spy, with Jason Statham, were all directed by Paul Feig. He\u2019s made tons of good TV, including multiple episodes of Arrested Development, Nurse Jackie and The Office, and he created Freaks And Geeks. His McCarthy movies are all critically rated somewhat above those directed by Falcone. With the Falcone-McCarthy projects, however, an extra layer of quality control is absent, and those movies lack a strong governing intelligence. It seems that McCarthy has a two-for-the-studio, one-for-me arrangement that permits her to lay these eggs every third time out. Perhaps the best news about the forthcoming McCarthy-starring Ghostbusters reboot is that Feig will behind the bullhorn and not the husband. All of which begs the screamingly obvious question: why aren\u2019t any of these movies directed by women?",
