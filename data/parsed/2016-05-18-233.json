  "body": "John Terry has ended speculation over his future by signing a new one-year contract with Chelsea. The 35-year-old captain\u2019s current deal was set to expire on 30 June but an agreement has been reached for the defender to stay on at Stamford Bridge under the new manager, Antonio Conte, next season. Terry, who had lucrative offers from clubs in China, cancelled a party due to be held on the pitch at Stamford Bridge on Monday as part of his farewell celebrations. However, after an emotional speech following Chelsea\u2019s final match of the season on Saturday against Leicester, the former England captain admitted he was relieved to stay at the club he joined as a 14-year-old. \u201cI am delighted to sign a new contract with the club,\u201d said Terry. \u201cEveryone knows I\u2019m Chelsea through and through. I am looking forward to next season under the new manager and hopefully we can make it a successful one. Also, a special mention to the fans for their continued support. You\u2019re the best in the world.\u201d   Related: Antonio Conte acquitted of fraud charges before beginning Chelsea tenure    He later added on Instagram: \u201cI am delighted to have signed another year with Chelsea. Thank you to my wife Toni, the club and all the players and management for your support. \u201cI want to say a special thanks to the fans for your unbelievable support throughout my career and especially on Sunday that will stay with me forever. BEST FANS EVER THANK YOU. \u201cI\u2019m am [sic] Chelsea through and through and I\u2019m looking forward to working under the new manager.\u201d Last week, Terry indicated his new contract will be for \u201ca different role\u201d at the club, effectively a reduced involvement in the team and a lower wage. In a rare public statement the Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia said she was delighted to have keep such \u201can important figure\u201d at Stamford Bridge. \u201cWe look forward to another year with John at the club, and believe he will be an important figure in the dressing room and on the pitch as we look to bring success back to the club next season,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, Conte said he is delighted to have been acquitted of fraud charges in his native Italy. On Tuesday a judge said the Italy manager was acquitted because the accusations of sporting fraud were baseless\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly great news, being found innocent is great news for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ask me if it ended well, I have a hard time saying yes. It will never be a happy ending, an absolution doesn\u2019t make me forget the years spent, the searches in my home at 5am, the cameras under my house \u2026 \u201cThese are things that hurt my family and me, they will leave a mark in my life.\u201d",
