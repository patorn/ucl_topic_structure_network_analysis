  "body": "Robert Peston\u2019s coup of landing David Cameron as a guest failed to boost ratings as his new Sunday morning ITV show saw its audience fall by almost a quarter. The third outing of Peston on Sunday pulled in an audience of 230,000 viewers and a 3.8% share of TV viewing from 10am on Sunday. This is well down on the 302,000 who tuned in the previous week, but up on the 166,000 who watched the new current affairs show\u2019s debut.

The ITV News political editor tweeted about the \u201cpacked\u201d guest lineup for Sunday, in particular landing Cameron.    .@david_cameron here, in make up with @lilyallen, and both tieless! ITV at 10am https://t.co/9aOkPV5hj5\u2014 Robert Peston (@Peston) May 22, 2016    In an interview last week, Vicky Flind, who left BBC1\u2019s This Week to launch Peston on Sunday, said that ITV News is \u201crealistic\u201d about the timescale for building the popularity of the show. \u201cOf course we want to build on the viewers and I think we can,\u201d she said, speaking to Broadcast magazine. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be realistic and patient.\u201d BBC1 won the 10am slot with Nicky Campbell\u2019s talk show The Big Questions, which didn\u2019t air last week, which drew an average of 700,000 viewers and an 11.7% share of total TV viewing. BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, which airs an hour earlier than Peston, was watched by 1.2 million viewers attracting a 19.4% share of total TV viewing between 9am and 10am.",
