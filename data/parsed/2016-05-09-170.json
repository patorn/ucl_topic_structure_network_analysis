  "body": "I felt queasy. It wasn\u2019t the morphine. I was 32 years old, lying in hospital, watching a Bledisloe Cup game. New Zealand v Australia. Another epic battle. On the screen, muscle and bone smashed into muscle and bone, impact after juddering impact. In bed, just a few days after a second knee reconstruction, I could see my right quadriceps had already begun to waste away at an incredible rate. Comparing my two thighs was like looking at a party balloon before and after \u2013 around a week after. The surgeon told me it was my body\u2019s natural reaction to the trauma in the joint, an instinctive appeal to avoid being used: a built-in defence mechanism. It felt like a betrayal. I needed the bloody thing to be strong. Shortly, I was going to have to begin painstakingly building that muscle up again, through weights sessions and physio work, running and jumping, week by week, month by month, so that it would be ready to smash into muscle and bone again. Rugby players \u2013 like most athletes \u2013 get used to pain early on, playing with it and through it almost constantly. But there is a danger that your mind is writing cheques your body can\u2019t keep cashing \u2013 and it is no surprise to see the players\u2019 union warning that the workload of England\u2019s squad is putting their health at risk. All these years later, the memory of what it\u2019s like to be in the middle of the arena has faded enough that I no longer wince empathetically at big hits. More than anything, I look at rugby games with a sense of amazement that I used to be able to do that.   Related: England rugby squad\u2019s workload puts welfare at risk, warns players\u2019 union    The highest level I played at was Heineken Cup, my career straddling amateur and professional eras, finishing in 2006. The game evolved massively over that time and since then has kept evolving. Every year the ball is in play for a little longer, the players get a little more powerful, the energy released in those spectacular collisions a little greater: incremental changes adding up to that much more stress on bodies constantly pushed to the limit. Building explosive muscle strength is one thing, but ligaments, tendons, bone will always have a breaking point. So it would be dangerous to extrapolate from the experiences of my generation to inform current and future players of theirs. One of the upsides of all that exposure to training and the science of sport is getting to know your own body, being attuned when it tells you it needs attention and having a fair idea of the remedy. I have a couple of bulging lumbar discs that can cause trouble and my knee never fully recovered, so I make sure I exercise and so far \u2013 touch wood - that works. What worries me is the brain. The New Zealand Herald featured a frankly terrifying series on the links between rugby concussions and dementia earlier this year. The precise nature of cause and effect remains unclear, but in American the NFL is about to pay out $1bn in a lawsuit that estimates nearly three in 10 former players could develop Alzheimer\u2019s or moderate dementia. Those are not great odds. Rugby isn\u2019t American football but, like many players, I had a few head knocks. More than once, I felt pressured to play when I wasn\u2019t feeling right, by coaches or the environment or a combination of both. Pushing yourself to the limit is so embedded in the culture that it\u2019s almost impossible not to lose perspective. I was told to stop playing after a first series of head injuries when I was just 21. This was before professionalism \u2013 we weren\u2019t being paid but we were going on tour and it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear. I sought a second opinion from the team doctor, who told me: \u201cThe truth is, nobody knows.\u201d Close enough. It\u2019s a moot point as to whether I should have rolled the dice at that age. By all accounts concussion is taken more seriously now. For all that, if a player of Alex Corbisiero\u2019s stature has been mismanaged to the point he has to take a year off to get his body and mind back in shape, alarm bells should be ringing. Here\u2019s hoping someone\u2019s listening.",
