And though most admire the building\u2019s beautiful design, they may not realise all new materials were sustainably sourced with a minimum carbon footprint.   Related: Swedish city builds 'passive houses' as part of ambitious CO2 reduction targets    \u201cWe wanted to create the ultimate sustainable building,\u201d says professor John French, CEO of the Adapt Low Carbon Group which commissioned the building and shepherded its construction. \u201cOur brief was to make The Enterprise Centre low carbon, both in operation and during construction, and to stimulate the local economy.\u201d It\u2019s built on a former brownfield site. Although Thetford Forest wood is generally regarded as a challenging construction material, the team decided to source 70% of the wood used for the building from there. To minimise carbon emissions, Adapt and its architecture and construction partners thatched straw along the building\u2019s external walls. This significantly increases insulation and enables The Enterprise Centre to satisfy Passive House standards \u2013 reserved for ultra-low energy consumption buildings. The team uses special software to measure the building\u2019s total carbon footprint \u2013 not just during construction but throughout its lifetime.     The environmental benefits of thatched roofs   Designing and building The Enterprise Centre created economic opportunities, too: 35 startups were created and 175 businesses integrated new products, processes or services into the building during construction. At \u00a311m, \u201cthe cost came out about the same as a regular university building,\u201d says French \u2013 and this is a key point. Sustainable architecture and passive houses have been built for many years but have failed to catch on among the general public \u2013 not because people don\u2019t want to live sustainably, but because sustainable buildings have been too expensive to build. \u201cWe need to demonstrate that eco-buildings are on par or cheaper than regular buildings, or otherwise [they] will remain marginal,\u201d says French. The Enterprise Centre is the 2016 winner in the built environment category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards.",
