That number is one billion. According to the corporate blurb on Twitter\u2019s website there are that many unique visits to sites that feature embedded tweets. The point is to illustrate that social network\u2019s reach is not restricted to those few hundred million people who directly engage at least once a month but to a bigger number \u2013 a much more Facebook-like number \u2013 of those exposed to tweets but who rarely, if ever, log onto the service.  There is both a necessity and logic to the one billion.  Necessity because data from elsewhere suggests Twitter\u2019s influence is waning. A report published last month by the social analytics company Parse.ly concluded that Twitter drives less than 5% of referrals to news organisations. Unsurprisingly, that\u2019s less than Facebook and Google. But it\u2019s also less than Yahoo. In its study of 200 websites over a two-week period in January, Parse.ly concluded that the median value of Twitter to news organisations looked like this: eight tweets per post, three clicks per tweet and 0.7 retweets for each original tweet. Not huge, in other words.  But Twitter\u2019s one billion number is logical too because there are those in publishing that believe Twitter\u2019s influence goes beyond the top line. Speaking at the Guardian Media Summit in London earlier this year, the Washington Post\u2019s director of strategic initiatives Jeremy Gilbert referred to the \u201cinterellation\u201d between social channels. Talking about the origin of the paper\u2019s Facebook referrals, Gilbert said: \u201cThe headwaters of those shares was often Twitter \u2026 Twitter is driving people to share on Facebook.\u201d  Talking to the Guardian more recently, Gilbert elaborated: \u201cfor the Post there are two large audiences on Twitter that matter a lot. One is journalists \u2013 and there is a lot of sharing from one journalistic site to another. The second are people \u2013 for personal passion or professional reasons \u2013 who really want to be seen as informed in spreading news. They are then helping to drive those shares through Facebook.\u201d Gilbert said that while some of this behaviour was trackable \u2013 monitoring the spread of shortened URLs, for example, as well as using Zignal Labs\u2019 cross media story-tracking platform \u2013 much of it was anecdotal.  But why are people prepared to share across platforms? Because it \u201cmakes them look smarter\u201d, Gilbert suggested. \u201cThere is some sort of currency on Facebook for being the first person on your graph to share something,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent social platforms have different functions in the dissemination of our news. Twitter is still very much a platform about breaking news and some of the deeper analysis.\u201d  It\u2019s a view broadly echoed by Martin Ashplant, digital director of Metro who conceded that even celebrities and influencers \u201cwith millions of Twitter followers don\u2019t drive the sort of traffic to publishers that Facebook does.\u201d He added, however: \u201cTwitter is a source of content and people use it among multiple other sources to then feed those other social platforms.\u201d Is this Twitter as news wire? \u201cYou can see that in multiple ways,\u201d said Ashplant. \u201cYou see it in terms of people putting a link on Twitter and helping it seed to another social platform. You also see it with journalists and bloggers spotting something on Twitter and turning it into a piece of content which they then feed into other social platforms.\u201d Notably, the largely negative Parse.ly report concluded that Twitter still \u201cserves a unique place in the link economy \u2026 News really does \u2018start\u2019 on Twitter\u201d.   Related: Cosmo and Lad Bible reach new audiences through social    There are a couple of other aspects to Twitter influence. First, those median engagement numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. Publications \u2013 often B2B and specialist publications \u2013 that have highly targeted audiences, tend to generate far greater engagement. Take Nieman Lab, which covers the digital publishing landscape and reported the Parse.ly findings. It claims that that 15% of its traffic comes from Twitter.  Second, a further piece of analysis \u2013 this time by the people behind the social media sharing tool Buffer \u2013 found that Twitter shares were more valuable than those from Facebook and LinkedIn. Across a 30-day period it recorded total page views and total shares by network. By dividing the former by the latter, it concluded that LinkedIn generated 0.75 page views per share, Facebook 1.5 page views per share and Twitter 2.0 page views per share.  So regardless of the stalling active users and top line numbers, perhaps Twitter still matters. Perhaps it still has influence, albeit indirectly. \u201cIf I were Twitter I would be trying hard to quantify that,\u201d said Ashplant, \u201cand talk about the number of influencers who are using Twitter as opposed to the number of people using Facebook who don\u2019t have that level of influence.\u201d Gilbert added that it was the influence of the Twitter users and their willingness to share cross platform that \u201cmakes it worth participating in the Twitter conversation even though the traffic from will not be as great as it is typically from Facebook.\u201d Jon Bernstein is an independent digital media consultant, editor and writer, formerly deputy editor, then digital director of New Statesman and multimedia editor at Channel 4 News.
