  "body": "It was an organised programme of state-sponsored murder in which US-backed regimes conspired to hunt down, kidnap and kill political opponents across South America and beyond.  Operation Condor \u2013 named after the world\u2019s largest carrion bird \u2013 was devised to eliminate thousands of exiled leftwing activists who had dared confront the military dictators who ruled the continent in the 1970s and 80s.  The exact number of its victims may never be known, but this week judges in Buenos Aires will deliver their verdict on the first court case to specifically focus on the conspiracy.

Photograph: Victor R Caivano/AP    Eighteen former military officers \u2013 including Argentina\u2019s last dictator Reynaldo Bignone, 88 \u2013 will on Friday be sentenced on charges including kidnapping, torture and forced disappearance. Seven other defendants, including Jorge Videla \u2013 the general who headed Argentina\u2019s junta during its bloodiest first three years \u2013 have died since the trial began in 2013.  The court has heard evidence on the deaths of more than 100 leftwing activists allegedly killed in Argentina, including 45 Uruguayans, 22 Chileans, 15 Paraguayans and 13 Bolivians. If the judges accept the thesis presented by the plaintiffs, many of them represented by the human rights group Cels (Centre for Legal and Social Studies) in Argentina, it will be first time the existence of the murderous, multi-nation plan is proven in court. The verdict is also likely to cast a fresh light on allegations that the operation was backed by the CIA \u2013 and at least tacitly approved by the then secretary of state Henry Kissinger. The plaintiffs allege that Operation Condor received support from the US, especially in the form of its communications system, which they say operated through Condortel, a US telex system based in Panama. Gast\u00f3n Chillier, the executive director of Cels, said: \u201cWhat we found among the large amount of documents we presented as evidence is that the US definitely had knowledge of the existence of the operation and even provided a communications station in Panama for the intelligence services of the six nations involved to communicate with each other via telex.\u201d     The dictators, from left: Jorge Videla of Argentina, Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo of Brazil and Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay. Composite: AP, Reuters & Rex Features    According to secret documents unearthed after democracy returned to the region, Operation Condor was originally drawn up at a secret 1975 meeting of intelligence chiefs from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, and later expanded to include Brazil. The minutes of the meeting were signed for Chile by Colonel Manuel Contreras, the dreaded head of that country\u2019s Dina secret police. Its purpose was to allow cooperating countries to send death squads into each other\u2019s territory \u2013 and sometimes further afield \u2013 to monitor, kidnap or kill political exiles. While some individual crimes committed during Operation Condor have been the subject of previous trials, Friday\u2019s verdict will focus on participation in the plan itself, said Chillier. \u201cWhat distinguishes this trial from other cases involving isolated crimes committed by Operation Condor is that the defendants now face being condemned for being members of an illegal association,\u201d he said. Among those who will be paying close attention to Friday\u2019s verdict is Edy Binstock, whose then wife Monica Pinus de Binstock, a young Argentinian member of the Montoneros urban guerrilla group, was captured by Brazilian security forces when her plane landed in Rio de Janeiro in March 1980. \u201cShe was from flying from Panama, and had called me by phone the day before, to arrange where we would meet in Rio. We had both escaped from Argentina because our lives were in danger there,\u201d Binstock told the Guardian. \u201cI waited and waited and she never showed up.\u201d It was when a batch of US documents from the period were declassified in 2002 that Binstock was able to discover his wife\u2019s fate.\u201cOne of the documents mentioned her by name, relating a conversation betweenan Argentinian military officer and a US diplomat at that time, with the officer saying how an Argentinian military plane had flown specially to Gale\u00e3o airport in Rio to pick her up and bring her to Buenos Aires, from where she was taken to the Campo de Mayo army facility, which at that time operated as a death camp.\u201dBinstock has still not been able to find out what happened to his wife after she was taken to Campo de Mayo. Another case involved a young Uruguayan couple, Mar\u00eda Gatti and Jorge Zaffaroni, who in 1975 fled to neighbouring Argentina, at the time still under democratic rule. After Argentina\u2019s 1976 coup the couple \u2013 and their infant daughter Mariana \u2013 were kidnapped by Uruguayan agents and taken to Automotores Orletti, a converted mechanic\u2019s garage that served as the \u201cOperation Condor\u201d headquarters in Buenos Aires.   Related: Pinochet directly ordered killing on US soil of Chilean diplomat, papers reveal    The couple were murdered and their child, then just one-year-old, was given to intelligence officer Miguel \u00c1ngel Furci to raise as his own.  Mariana Zaffaroni was eventually reunited with her biological family in 1992 and Furci was sentenced for her kidnapping the following year. Furci is now also among the defendants to be sentenced on Friday, on 67 counts of \u201cdisappearances\u201d and torture at Orletti. The impact of Operation Condor was not limited to Latin America: one of the most dramatic episodes took place in Washington DC.  In 1976, Orlando Letelier, Chile\u2019s former defence and foreign minister under President Salvador Allende, was killed by a car bomb that detonated in front of the Irish embassy on Sheridan Circle. US intelligence documents declassified last year show that the order to kill Letelier had come directly from the dictator, General Augusto Pinochet.

Photograph: AP    Declassified State Department records show that the month before Letelier\u2019s murder, Kissinger had ordered US ambassadors posted to the six Condor countries to express Washington\u2019s \u201cdeep concern\u201d at the possible assassination of \u201cpoliticians and prominent figures\u201d in South America and beyond.  The ambassadors, fearful to raise the topic with their hosts, demurred, suggesting that it would be safer to approach the South American ambassadors posted in Washington instead.  But Kissinger rescinded the order on 16 September, just five days before Letelier\u2019s murder, instructing that \u201cno further action should be taken on this matter\u201d.",
