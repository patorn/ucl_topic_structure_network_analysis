  "body": "As Europe grapples with the rise of anti-immigration parties, Sadiq Khan\u2019s appointment as the first directly elected Muslim mayor of a western capital city is important. According to those who responded to a Guardian callout, people living in the rest of Europe welcome the choice Londoners have made. \u201cSadiq\u2019s appointment sends a great message to the world. It reflects Britain\u2019s state of mind which, as a French person, I think is more open-minded than France,\u201d said 18-year-old Mathilde from the south of France. \u201cIt tells me that Londoners see above the religion or the race of a person.\u201d Last year, a YouGov poll found that 31% of those living in the capital would be uncomfortable having a Muslim mayor, and 13% were not sure. But the 1,310,143 people who voted for Khan have boosted London\u2019s reputation as a multicultural, multi-faith and liberal city. Mathilde lives in Alleins, a village not far from Marseille, which is home to 250,000 Muslims, the second largest population in France. In the 2015 regional elections Alleins citizens voted for the rightwing party Les R\u00e9publicains (52%), and the far-right Front National (FN) (48%). In the first round of the local election Front National led, losing out in the second round to Les R\u00e9publicains. \u201cI live in an area where, ironically, there are many Muslims but where the FN has the most success. There are definitely discriminations against Muslim people, even though it\u2019s often in discreet forms. \u201cI tend to notice that Muslims are not really integrated in society but left in a corner. I think the Paris attacks helped the rightwing parties, especially the far-right party, to become more important. In fact the regional elections happened a little while after the attacks\u201d she said. Louis, 18, who also lives in southern France, feels that Muslim people are more integrated into society than Mathilde describes but doesn\u2019t ever expect to see a Muslim political candidate in a similar position to Khan.  \u201cFor me, it doesn\u2019t matter what his religion is or where he comes from as long as he\u2019s qualified and skilled. I guess [Khan\u2019s win] highlights London\u2019s ethnic diversity and that he won thanks to their vote,\u201d he said. Rafiq, 70, from Switzerland, has positive experiences of Muslim people standing for local elections and gaining votes, despite the populist rightwing Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP) winning the biggest share of the vote in Switzerland\u2019s elections last year.  \u201cIt seems that acts of Islamophobia are not as widespread as are sometimes reported. Like most places Switzerland has all kinds of people, but many are open-minded and friendly with neighbours who are polite and kind to my hijab-wearing wife. Several Muslims are standing for election and some of them get a good number of votes, but not quite enough,\u201d he said. Ursula, 62, from Munich believes that despite some visible rightwing sentiment Germans would vote regardless of religion. \u201cI think that convincing characters would have equal chances, no matter their religious beliefs. I was surprised by Sadiq Khan\u2019s appointment. I had expected that the non-Muslim majority would not like to be represented by a Muslim major. Maybe such a big city attracts people with an open mind?  \u201cThe Muslim part of society is not very active politically. I suppose the majority still keep their distance, feeling that they should not get involved,\u201d she said.  Wolfram, a 67-year-old from Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in the west of Germany, has seen anti-immigration sentiment pervade where he lives and can\u2019t see a Muslim politician being elected any time soon. \u201cIt seems that Londoners accept their history and the consequences of the empire, and the outcome gives hope that people with different faiths can live together peacefully.\u201d Wolfram said he could not imagine a Muslim politician being elected where he lived, \u201ccertainly not in the near future. There\u2019s a rather deep split between those who are afraid of the increasing number of Muslim people and the other citizens who are open-minded, even about open borders for refugees.\u201d Hanna, 24, from Helsinki, thinks Khan\u2019s win is important given the hate speech and discrimination facing Muslims in Europe, the rise of rightwing parties, and what she describes as \u201copenly racist politicians in Finland\u201d.  \u201cThe anti-immigration party Perussuomalaiset [known as Finns party, or PS] got into government and peoples\u2019 attitudes have become harder towards refugees, especially to Muslims. The foreign minister, Timo Soini, who is party leader and co-founder of PS and a Catholic, even suggested we should favour Christian refugees. \u201cAs we took more refugees in than ever, the PS are losing supporters. But this means some people are going for even more rightwing politics like Rajat Kiinni! (Borders Closed!). On their Facebook page they openly call all Muslims rapists and terrorists. \u201cFor this reason I\u2019m happy about Khan\u2019s appointment, but mostly because of his politics, not just his religion. I don\u2019t really like any organised religions, but everyone\u2019s free to believe what they want. It seems to me that Londoners think politics are more important than what religion someone believes in. They are wise,\u201d she said. Many respondents to the callout hope Khan\u2019s win will raise the status of Muslim people living in their own towns and cities across Europe, and help to involve them more in political life.  Nesi, 44, a secondary school teacher who lives in a small city outside Madrid, hopes Khan\u2019s win will go some way in helping to improve Muslim people\u2019s opportunities. \u201cFor the child of an ethnic minority to go into higher education, take part in politics and become a mayor, a lot of things in Spain have to change and improve. I think there must be some cases, but society doesn\u2019t provide equal opportunities for all children.  \u201cPolitical posts of any relevance are mostly only for those who go to university or belong to a rich traditional family. And certainly not for a Muslim, I am afraid to say. Spain is too conservative in general to allow a Muslim to take part in politics. \u201cSadiq\u2019s appointment shows that politics and important issues in the world should be about people, not religion. It also shows that a multicultural society living in peace is possible. And of course it shows what a fantastic place to live London can be, sometimes.\u201d",
