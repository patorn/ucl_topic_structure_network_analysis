  "body": "In his first sitdown interview as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump refused to back down on his longstanding \u2013 and long-since debunked \u2013 claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and also refused to denounce antisemitic attacks on a journalist who wrote a profile about his wife. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, Trump doubled down on some of his most controversial and inflammatory positions, claiming his statements about the president\u2019s nationality or his attempts to link the father of former rival Ted Cruz to the assassination of John F Kennedy were proportional to attacks waged against himself. \u201cI\u2019ve given up a tremendous amount to run for president,\u201d Trump told Blitzer. \u201cI gave up two more seasons of Celebrity Apprentice.\u201d Blitzer asked Trump specifically to address his supporters who had sent \u201cvicious\u201d messages to journalist Julia Ioffe this week. After her profile of Donald Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, appeared in this month\u2019s issue of GQ, the Russian-American journalist received a torrent of antisemitic and threatening messages from supporters of the Republican frontrunner. \u201cI don\u2019t have a message to the fans \u2013 I\u2019m not gonna talk about that,\u201d Trump said, calling Ioffe\u2019s story \u201cnasty\u201d and defending his wife against unspecified falsehoods in the piece. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to have bad things said about her,\u201d he said of his wife. Trump protested that he knew nothing of any antisemitic or abusive comments and threats directed at Ioffe. When Blitzer asked Trump about his past support of \u201cbirtherism\u201d \u2013 the fervent and unsubstantiated belief that Obama was secretly born outside of the United States and is therefore constitutionally ineligible for the presidency, Trump pinned his past statements on his likely opponent in the general election: Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who started it,\u201d Trump said. The billionaire has long argued that the former secretary of state was the instigator in the birther movement, although evidence for this assertion has not surfaced. Trump, whose senior campaign staff have intimated to Republican party leadership that the candidate would moderate his tone in the general election, also refused to walk back statements on other hot-button issues, including his signature proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigration into the United States.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, I mean, look, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said, when Blitzer asked if such a proposal would alienate America\u2019s allies in the Middle East. \u201cThe migration is a disaster \u2013 we\u2019re letting in thousands of people. They don\u2019t have documentation, they don\u2019t have paperwork, we don\u2019t know who they are or where they come from.\u201d In an interview with the New York Times Trump said he would implement the ban within his first 100 days, the paper reported. He also declared that his suggestion that US troop presence in friendly nations should be subsidized was still a key feature of his proposed national security platform. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to police the entire world,\u201d Trump said, when asked if he would allow Japan and South Korea to become nuclear powers. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to walk, and if they don\u2019t take care of us properly ... they\u2019re gonna have to defend themselves.\u201d When Blitzer quoted a military estimate that it might cost more money to house American troops in the US than in Japan, Trump implied that perhaps those troops were redundant. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need them. Maybe you don\u2019t need them.\u201d",
