Voltaire was once asked. \u201cAll styles are good,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept for the boring kind.\u201d People like the idea of busyness because it is better than feeling bored. The sadness at the heart of Waiting for Godot is that, for Vladimir and Estragon, there is \u201cnothing to be done\u201d (the play\u2019s opening line). The closing stage direction says: \u201cThey do not move.\u201d   Related: UK productivity gap widens to worst level since records began    Researchers at the University of Texas have found that older people who remain active score better in cognitive tests than those who are less busy. As well as the financial penalty in unemployment (and under-employment), there is a psychological cost too. \u201cBe not solitary, be not idle\u201d ran the traditional advice to those hoping to avoid gloom and despair. Today that would be classed as a \u201ctop tip.\u201d So, let\u2019s get busy? Hang on. Who determines how busy you have to be? Has your busyness been created by an unreasonable or unrealistic deadline, or an impossible workload? Have you been left to be busy all on your own \u2013 you\u2019ve avoided the idle bit, but are still resoundingly solitary? Busyness is not what you might call an unalloyed good. Indeed, if simply being busy and stressed were such a good idea, why has the UK\u2019s productivity \u2013 the measure of useful (or \u201cvalue-adding\u201d) work done \u2013 failed to improve over the last few years? Being busy is not an end in itself. It is better to be busy with a productive purpose, with the aim of creating a worthwhile outcome. One of the imbalances in our economy is that some remain too busy while others are not busy enough. John Maynard Keynes anticipated a world of leisure in which essential tasks could be completed in a few hours, leaving us all with much more time for cultural and recreational pursuits. More recently, the New Economics Foundation argued that a 21-hour working week might reduce unnecessary busyness while allowing us to make better and more sustainable use of the earth\u2019s limited resources.    The benefits of so-called 'multitasking' have now been revealed to be a myth    Traditional supervisory management required staff to look busy, with the aim of reassuring the managers that something was actually being done. In an age of \u201cknowledge work\u201d, with people clicking away at computers all day, it is harder to know if the apparent busyness is really leading to anything. One thing in favour of the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d is that identifiable tasks are often being completed. There is nothing phoney about the busyness of Deliveroo riders. How happy they might be in their work is another matter. So yes, busyness may be good for keeping the brain ticking over, but it is not necessarily good for efficiency. The benefits of so-called \u201cmultitasking\u201d have now been revealed to be a myth. Stress distracts and undermines us, and really good work is the product of a focused mind. \u201cWe\u2019re far more productive if we singletask,\u201d says Caroline Webb, author of the recently published How to Have a Good Day. A new balance has to be struck, one that allows room for calm human interaction as well as the exciting, always-on world of digital connection. Bringing this about will take maturity and good old time management skills. We have to be able to say no to unreasonable demands if we are going to stay sane and productive. Condemning those who are fit and talented to inactivity is a social as well as an economic crime. The costs are both social and economic, too. So let there be some more busyness for those who want and need it, but also space and quiet for those who don\u2019t. It is all a matter of getting our priorities right \u2013 rather like the boss who put up a sticky note on his office door,reading: \u201cNo, I do not have a bloody minute.\u201d",
