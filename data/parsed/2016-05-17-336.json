  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull is selling his \u201cjobs and growth\u201d election message with the zeal of a man whose life\u2019s ambition depends on it. Which, of course, it does.  Yes, he\u2019s already prime minister. But governing for 10 months leading into an election cycle isn\u2019t really long enough to do anything. For Turnbull the 2 July poll is about vindication, about leading the nation in his own right, with his own mandate and the authority inside his own party to start doing it more his own way. Governing for long enough to make a difference, to do big things, to change the nature of the political debate. To do what he has always firmly believed he could. He beams even before he enters the room, leans forward into conversations, talks to the cameras with utter certainty. But he never strays far from the script, and when he\u2019s delivering attack lines similar to those of the man he deposed, on climate policy or asylum, his conviction fades, and he hurries them, as if to get them over with.    Related: Australians crave change. But this election won't deliver it | David Marr    To achieve his goal Turnbull seems to have stopped speaking in the way that for many years made him the country\u2019s most popular choice as leader, according to opinion polls. To win the chance to govern in his own voice he seems to have calculated that for a time he has to temper himself, stay on message, talk the talk of a more conventional candidate. This is the guy who promised to end the three-word slogans, to \u201crespect the intelligence\u201d of the electorate, but who now says \u201cjobs and growth\u201d in every second breath. This is the former merchant banker who was always so hungry for the next big idea that political friends joked he suffered from \u201cmerchant banker\u2019s disease\u201d, but who now seems to have agreed to say much the same thing every day for two months. He\u2019s the risk-taking candidate who is running the most calculatingly risk-averse election campaign, with one central selling point, deliberately minimised points of difference, fleeting press conferences and few long-form interviews. Turnbull promised to end dumb scare campaigns but now claims Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy will \u201csmash house prices\u201d and \u201cjack up rents\u201d, when modelling suggests it will reduce house prices by a one-off 2%. And he\u2019s in lock-step with the campaign strategy of denouncing any Labor candidate who has ever expressed concern about the human cost of Australia\u2019s asylum policy.

Turnbull still leads the Labor leader as preferred PM by 49% to 27%, according to Newspoll. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian    He\u2019s the conviction politician who once lost his job for putting principle before power, who said he would never lead a party not as committed to dealing with climate change as he was. But now he dutifully calls any emissions trading scheme \u201cunaffordable\u201d and advocates Tony Abbott\u2019s Direct Action, the policy of which he said, soon after losing the Liberal leadership to Abbott in 2009: \u201cAny suggestion that you can dramatically cut emissions without any cost is, to use a favourite term of Mr Abbott, bullshit.\u201d Everyone knows he was right then, the policy will have to change after the election, but Turnbull just won\u2019t talk about it. The Coalition strategists are no doubt pleased. Many commentators are urging him to conform still further, to avoid getting \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201cwaffly\u201d. But for voters the morphing of Malcolm is a perplexing thing. The man many of them thought they liked seemed different from the man now on their television screens.    He\u2019s almost overly adherent to being consultative  Liberal source     The change can be explained in part by obvious practicalities, such as the exigencies of office and political circumstance \u2013 Turnbull came to power hemmed in by an election no more than a year away, a sluggish economy and the treacherous undercurrents of his own party that swept away his leadership the last time. And it\u2019s probably partly about the realities of governing \u2013 a fiendishly difficult thing, especially taking the prime ministership many years after you\u2019ve last dealt with the day-to-day pressures of detailed policy work while facing a demanding media cycle. Especially when your predecessor has \u2013 as one Turnbull insider put it \u2013 \u201cshredded everything\u201d. And it\u2019s part the product of unrealistic expectations, from progressives who somehow thought Turnbull\u2019s stated position on things like marriage equality or climate change or the republic might translate to a broader common cause and from voters who seemed to hope subbing in one bloke they quite liked might somehow change everything they hated about the dumbed-down busted-up political system. Those close to him urge critics to remember how much has changed.  He has silenced the daily drumbeat of national-security scares under Abbott. He has insisted on proper policy consideration, refusing to play the game of daily media \u201cannounceables\u201d. He has more or less unified his party by sidelining some of the most contentious issues while the conservatives licked their wounds. After railing against the Abbott office briefing the Daily Telegraph about \u201cdecisions\u201d before they had been taken by cabinet, he has insisted on proper cabinet process. (Although there have been a few leaks, and Labor has often been suspiciously well-informed.) He has re-empowered ministers and allowed them to run their own portfolios. His office has relaxed the centralised command-and-control structure of Abbott\u2019s chief of staff, Peta Credlin. In fact, some strong backers thinks he has overcorrected: \u201cHe\u2019s almost overly adherent to being consultative ... there\u2019s times he should have put his foot down and used his prime ministerial authority to settle things,\u201d says one. But even factoring in all those considerations, what\u2019s happening is still genuinely perplexing.   Related: Guardian Live election special    It\u2019s perplexing measured against what voters hoped for. But it\u2019s also a gamble when measured against the ruthless pragmatism of politics. Because diluting Turnbull\u2019s authenticity diminishes the very thing the published polls suggested the electorate liked about him, and the very reason his party put him in the job. His popularity is plummeting. He still leads Bill Shorten as preferred prime minister by 49% to 27% according to Newspoll, but that is down from 64% to 15% late last year. His personal satisfaction ratings are now well into negative territory \u2013 more voters disapprove of the job he is doing than give him the thumbs up. And it\u2019s allowing his opponent, Shorten, a leader who followed the most conventional of political career paths and was ridiculed for the inauthenticity of his zinger-style communications, to present himself as the risk-taking man of values-based convictions. The old Turnbull seemed to fit in an era when voters are turning to political \u201coutsiders\u201d, to leaders who don\u2019t follow the usual rules of the sterile political game.  He\u2019s the contender who didn\u2019t spend his life pursuing a political career, who instead becoming a self-made millionaire with a series of pre-politics careers, as a journalist, a lawyer, a businessman (founding the internet service provider Ozemail) and a merchant banker and who ran the unsuccessful campaign for Australia to become a republic in 1999. He\u2019s the leader who lost his job for a policy principle, the politician who was believable when he said he was motivated by ideas, the man with more than enough money and other options to walk away from politics, and who announced he would, after losing the Liberal leadership, only to change his mind.     Turnbull on the campaign trail at Flinders University in Adelaide last week. There have been flashes of his former style, such as when he talks about his plans for cities and public transport, or when he enthuses about the possibilities for the Australian economy. Photograph: Reuters    But his great dilemma was obvious as soon as he became prime minister. The public liked him for being different and promising to end cynical, polarised politics, but many of his colleagues only voted for him because he told them he\u2019d be pretty much the same. A day later I wrote: \u201cIf he can\u2019t begin to resolve this dilemma quickly, Turnbull\u2019s perceived authenticity \u2013 the view that he is a man true to his convictions, a different kind of politician \u2013 could quickly turn into a perception that he is an opportunistic fake, just more of the same.\u201d He started as if he might really intend to proceed differently. He held a national reform summit where he promised to listen to all views and keep an open mind on policy. He put most of the tax options Abbott had ruled out back \u201con the table\u201d. He scrapped Australian knights and dames and did not reappoint the climate sceptic Maurice Newman as his business adviser. He launched his innovation statement \u201cideas boom\u201d. The new funding was limited but it was a clear statement of intent. He appointed the star public servant Dr Martin Parkinson \u2013 removed by Abbott as as the head of the Treasury \u2013 to head his prime minister\u2019s department.   Related: Why are we surprised by every populist politician? Voting for them can be a rational choice | Jason Wilson    And there are flashes of his former style, such as when he talks about his plans for cities and public transport, or when he enthuses about the possibilities for the Australian economy, and shafts of new policy style \u2013 such as the budget\u2019s well-thought-through and highly progressive changes to superannuation. But there are also times \u2013 many in the campaign \u2013 when he sounds as though he\u2019s delivering someone else\u2019s lines, as though he\u2019s a stand-in, pressed into a playing a part he doesn\u2019t much care for but has to endure. He has repeatedly prioritised internal order over things he had previously fought for, shying away from head-on conflicts with the Abbott forces, playing the long game. Turnbull stuck with the Abbott policy for a same-sex marriage plebiscite, for example, even though he had openly criticised the idea when the former prime minister came up with it. But when the attorney general, George Brandis, confirmed the seemingly obvious, that it would probably be held by the end of the year, the conservatives \u201cwent ballistic\u201d \u2013 fearful that they might be thwarted in their desire to use the policy to make sure no change happened. Turnbull promptly deferred even a final cabinet decision on the details of the process \u2013 a decision that was, at the time, imminent. He has overseen decisions that must surely offend his desire for credible policy process \u2013 an \u201cinterim\u201d pre-election decision to reject a Chinese bid for S Kidman\u2019s vast agricultural properties without any clear and transparent reasons as to why, and a \u201cbrought forward\u201d pre-election announcement of the chosen tenderer for the massive $50bn submarine build \u2013 with guarantees that every sub would be built in Adelaide \u2013 before any actual contracts have been signed. The prime minister, with a businessman\u2019s detailed keep-all-options-open due-diligence approach to decision making, semi-publicly skirmished for a while with his treasurer, who is far more the simple-message retail politician kind of guy, before abandoning the idea of increasing the goods and services tax and locking in behind an economic plan that fitted the election strategy and slogan: Labor stands for \u201ctax and spend\u201d while the Coalition backs \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. That also meant ditching things that made sense, including changes to some revenue sources the government had openly considered, such as cracking down on negative gearing rules that provide tax breaks to the highest income earners, and launching a scare campaign against Labor\u2019s plans for the same. It meant shelving most ambitious spending proposals and borrowing Abbott\u2019s carbon tax scare campaign, even though Labor\u2019s policy has fundamentally changed.    Turnbull is banking that disillusionment is not yet too strong, that voters are not yet too angry with the game    Taken together, all these decisions mean the Coalition\u2019s re-election plan can run to a very conventional script, a basic calculation that at a time when voters are uncertain about the economy and weary of political dysfunction and upheaval they don\u2019t want big change or grand plans, they just want competent, sensible government. They want Turnbull to give them enough of a reason to confirm their pre-existing inclination to vote for him and not to risk returning so quickly to Labor. Shorten, knowing he has to surprise voters, startle them into reconsidering Labor after all the upheavals and treacheries of the Rudd/Gillard years, has taken risks with policy and approach, running a non-traditional big-target campaign based on \u201cLabor values\u201d. Shorten is gifting Turnbull multiple ways to claim that Labor is a risk not worth taking but giving himself the ability to argue with genuine conviction. Liberal strategists, adept at finding a single idea that cuts through all the noise of an election, insist their plan is working. They are convinced the disappointment with Turnbull and Labor\u2019s polling gains are among progressive voters who were never really likely to vote Liberal in the first place, that Labor\u2019s campaign might appeal to the media and the opinion \u201celites\u201d, but among swinging voters in marginal electorates the \u201cjobs and growth\u201d message is hitting home. They say the national polls, with the parties level-pegging or Labor slightly ahead, disguise a much more positive picture in the marginals and point to Labor\u2019s primary vote stuck around 35% or 36%. And perhaps they\u2019re right.      Shorten is gifting Turnbull multiple ways to claim that Labor is a risk not worth taking \u2013 but giving himself the ability to argue with genuine conviction. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian    Marginal seat polling early in the campaign shows swings to Labor insufficient to win them. Turnbull can be persuasive and warm and genuinely empathetic, as when he encountered Serge Oreshkin, a grieving father who lost his son on MH17 as he campaigned in Sydney. But when he switches back to his natural discursive style he does sometimes say things that seem to leave voters cold, that reinforce Labor\u2019s message that he is \u201cout of touch\u201d \u2013 not in the dog whistle way in which that phrase is just code for \u201cwealthy\u201d \u2013 but in a brutally factual way. This is a man who, in the first leaders\u2019 debate, referred to housing as an \u201casset class\u201d (true from the point of view of a big portfolio investor, but not quite the way most people would view it) and who thought he would win the backing of ordinary western Sydney voters by chiding Shorten for suggesting bankers should be put \u201cin the dock\u201d. Perhaps being ruthlessly on-message is his best chance of success.  And election reporting does not reward ad libbing or changes of plan \u2013 cancelling one western Sydney street walk dominated a whole day\u2019s coverage of his campaign. Turnbull is calculating that winning, even with a reduced majority, gives him a shot at enough years in office to make lasting changes that aren\u2019t unwound in the switchback of leadership coups and rotating governments, that he\u2019s doing what it takes to get a proper shot at the job.  That\u2019s why he took the risk of trying to reform the Senate, even though on current polling the new system may not deliver him an easier line-up to work with. That\u2019s why he\u2019s gambling that even though his workshopped messages sound out of kilter with what he promised, it won\u2019t upset voters so much that he loses. But he\u2019s taking that gamble at a time when political mistrust and cynicism is higher than it has been in decades.    The great conviction politician turned out to be not that different from the rest  Hugh Mackay     A survey by the the Museum of Australian Democracy and the institute for governance and policy analysis at the University of Canberra taken this year showed levels of trust in government and politicians were at their lowest levels since 1993, that 74% of the electorate thought people in government would look after themselves, rather than do the right thing, either sometimes, or most of the time. Turnbull is banking that that disillusionment is not yet too strong, that voters are not yet too angry with the \u201cgame\u201d the former Labor minister, now academic, Carmen Lawrence described in her Griffith Review essay \u2013 \u201cone in which the players face off as deadly opponents when they are, in reality, largely indistinguishable; a game that requires us to suspend disbelief and not to notice that not much of value is really being debated\u201d. The prime minister had implicitly promised he\u2019d opt out of all of that but now he\u2019s playing much like the others \u2013 even if his attacks lack some of the venom of Abbott\u2019s. In 2012, in an interview for a cover profile in Fairfax\u2019s Good Weekend magazine about whether he still harboured prime ministerial ambitions, Turnbull told me: \u201cI am an ambitious person, but I am not ambitious in the sense that I want jobs only for the sake of them ... I am always careful that the political positions I take are consistent with good policy. I would not want to be prime minister of Australia at any price.\u201d We\u2019re learning the price he is willing to pay, the compromises he is willing to make to earn the chance of stable years of governing.     Turnbull has a beer with Liberal member for Solomon Natasha Griggs at a politics in the pub event in Darwin on Monday. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP    In that piece the veteran social commentator Hugh Mackay tried to explain Turnbull\u2019s appeal, saying he was \u201cpossibly the only politician on either side seen as a man true to his convictions\u201d, someone who \u201cmay be seen as arrogant, but is also seen as a man of substance and that is exactly what the electorate is yearning for\u201d. By Mackay\u2019s reckoning, if Turnbull had been leading the Liberals at that time it would be \u201cput your glasses down the race is over\u201d. Now, Mackay, says, the yearning is the same, only keener, because Turnbull has turned out not to be so different after all.   Related: Lucky man: has Bill Shorten got what it takes?    \u201cWe all remember the euphoria when he was elected, on both sides of the fence, we all heard Labor voters saying maybe they\u2019d vote for him because they just weren\u2019t inspired by Shorten, but then the great conviction politician turned out to be not that different from the rest, and that means he turned out to be very, very different from our expectations.\u201d Will a wary electorate be persuaded to trust that, despite his perplexing metamorphosis, Turnbull still could be the leader they thought he was? Or have the campaign strategists got it wrong? Do voters really want change rather than just reassurance? If his gamble pays off voters will get the definitive answer to the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to Malcolm?\u201d They\u2019ll live what colleagues once called \u201cthe Malcolm experiment\u201d in real time. If it backfires it will challenge some basic assumptions about the way politics works.  \u2022 Join Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy in Sydney and Melbourne as they host our Guardian Live election special featuring a panel of prominent political guests",
