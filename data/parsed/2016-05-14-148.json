  "body": "Next to me, a battered old van is vibrating gently. Its driver, a wrinkled, toothless man wearing a white taqiyah (prayer cap) leans out of the window and grins at me. I gamely smile back and wave. He gives me a thumbs up. I return it. Then he puts his index finger and thumb together in the universal sign for \u201cyou\u2019re so cool\u201d. He\u2019s right, I think. I do look pretty cool, sat nonchalantly on the back of a vintage motorbike in Marrakech\u2019s rush hour, to a soundtrack of beeping, rumbling truck engines and the distant call of a muezzin. Then the gendarme lifts his arm, the traffic roars and I have to cling on (less nonchalantly), while we leave the old man and his pick-up for dust. Of course, it\u2019s what I\u2019m sitting on that\u2019s cool. Not me. I\u2019m on a tour with Insiders Experience, which has just begun offering motorbike city tours in Morocco. The company started in Shanghai in 2008 when French founder Thomas Chabrieres opened a business that combined his love of vintage sidecars and travelling. His passion resulted in the purchase of a number of Urals (a Russian copy of a 1930s BMW design) and some imaginative rebranding of these rugged pieces of Soviet history into suitable sightseeing vehicles.     Passengers can sit on the back of the bike or hop in a sidecar    As a passenger, you can choose to sit on the back \u2013 which may feel a bit intimate for those who prefer not to touch thighs with their tour guides \u2013 or you can hop in a sidecar. I can\u2019t help but feel that this option, which puts the rider at the exact level of bus exhaust pipes, might mar the novelty factor but it would be prissy to whimper about lungfuls of CO2. A wind-in-the-hair, dirt-in-the face romp is what you\u2019re signing up for. The blurb on the website talks about majestic landscapes and fabled history, which sounds rather formulaic, just the reason I\u2019m not normally a fan of organised tours \u2013 too ordered, too unadventurous. But then I meet Felix.     Motorbiking around the city.    \u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d he asks, in a strong Irish accent. All of the tours are tailor-made, so we discuss what I\u2019d like to see and when I need to be back (in time for gin at Riad El Fenn, a characterful hotel in the heart of the medina). I\u2019ve already spent plenty of time (and money) in the old town, so Felix decides on a route that will take in bits of the city I haven\u2019t seen and we roar off northwards. We cruise by the Catholic L\u2019Eglise Des Saints Martyrs, the first church to be built in Marrakech. Felix points out the striking pink mosque opposite it, two buildings often cited as an example of the city\u2019s religious tolerance. In some ways the area, Gu\u00e9liz, is unremarkable \u2013 smart houses, wide streets and kids on their way home from school. But it\u2019s also an area emerging as an artistic hub and we rumble past spots such as 127, which, in 2006, became the first photo gallery ever to open in the Maghreb. Felix weaves through the traffic and we negotiate one of the wider entries to an outer, less-visited part of the souk. I constantly expect him to shout \u201chang on\u201d, or something that might indicate a concern for my welfare as we round a blind corner. But he does no such thing. \u201cWe are really highly trained,\u201d he reassures me later. \u201cSometimes I won\u2019t talk because I\u2019m concentrating,\u201d but generally, as the average speed is only 20kmh, \u201cwe answer emails faster than we drive motorbikes.\u201d     View over the nearby Atlas mountains. Photograph: Felix Mathivet    Soon we are beyond the hubbub, zooming past the city walls and into the Palmeraie, a now-protected neighbourhood where centuries of palm cultivation provided the city with food, raw materials and greenery. You could stop at the ancient underground irrigation systems that brought the area to life, but instead we pull up at the lovely Addi Ou Addi, the oldest villa in the area. It has vibrant zellige floor tiling, ornately carved wooden walls and the original 1927 furniture. It\u2019s not open to the public and is one of several places that Chabrieres\u2019 wide network makes accessible. Next, we head offroad through the groves that give the Palmeraie area its name. Expanses of pink-tinged sand are dotted with palm trees whose roots are protected from the elements (and wandering goats) by mounds of compacted sand. It\u2019s a picturesque spot for a picnic and a drink \u2013 with the sun setting, and kicking up a cloud of rosy tangerine dust as we go, only sunglasses and a billowing head scarf could make it more cinematic. Afterwards, petrolhead friends ask me unanswerable questions about the motorbike; Moroccophiles wonder whether you see anything differently from the bike. Of course, the city\u2019s sights don\u2019t change but Insiders\u2019 take on it is a new one for me. Marrakech isn\u2019t the most accessible city \u2013 cycling is hard work and the abrupt ending of pavements makes it less walkable than some cities. The motorbike\u2019s agility allows access to things you wouldn\u2019t otherwise see. But also, just being along for the ride makes you feel good \u2013 wind-blown, grubby, and with a face aching from smiling in response to all those beeps, stares and waves.\u2022 The trip was provided by Insiders Experience. Tours in Marrakech, from one hour to half a day, cost from \u00a3100, insidersexperience.com",
