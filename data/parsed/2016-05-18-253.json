  "body": "Pharmaceutical firms currently pay about \u00a340m every year to healthcare professionals, including doctors and pharmacists. These payments could be for anything from expert advice to sponsoring a healthcare professional\u2019s medical education. Now, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) has created a central database, going live in June, on which its member companies, and others that have signed up to comply with the ABPI code of practice, will disclose who these payments are made to, and for what. At the same time, Jeremy Hunt\u2019s \u201csunshine rule\u201d will make it mandatory for NHS staff to declare gifts received from drug companies.  How will this new transparency affect the complex matrix of relationships between health professionals, pharmaceutical firms, the NHS and, most importantly, patients? That was the underlying question under discussion at a seminar hosted by the Guardian and sponsored by the ABPI.  Experts from all sides of the debate made up the panel, which was followed by a keynote address by George Freeman, minister for life sciences. Sarah Boseley of the Guardian kicked off the discussion by pointing out that the ABPI database has already come in for some criticism: the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges says it doesn\u2019t go far enough. But should disclosure be mandatory? Only 69% of healthcare professionals say they would agree to have their relationships with pharmaceutical companies disclosed on the publicly searchable database.  Virginia Acha of ABPI said that 69% was an encouraging figure and stressed the need for education and understanding for those who choose to opt out. \u201cIf people are worried about disclosure, addressing the payments made is key,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be pleased to see my GP have up on his bulletin board that he\u2019d been involved in clinical studies, or was pursuing training in his own time, as that\u2019s reinforcing to me that the care he\u2019s giving me and my family is the best in the world. We need to help people feel more confident in this disclosure environment and explain what the money is for.\u201d Disclosure of payments from pharmaceutical firms Ash Soni of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society agreed that disclosed payments need to be seen in the right context to be of value. \u201cIt\u2019s important that there is an ability to respond and react to some of this disclosure. Sometimes people are doing things in the best interests of collaboration, but then something gets published or something comes out which means people are tarred with the brush of accepting money from someone for something. But you don\u2019t get the opportunity to say why, what the purpose was, what it was designed to do, why the engagement was there.\u201d The panel members were in broad agreement that increased transparency is a good thing, whether it\u2019s disclosing payments or publishing clinical research data \u2013 but, like Soni, Nikki Yates of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) stressed the need for education around its issues. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve embraced it [disclosure and transparency issues] is to take a step towards ensuring that whoever we are working with has a full understanding of why this is an important thing to do,\u201d said Yates. Since 2014, she said, GSK has had a disclosure clause in its contracts. Thus far, it has had more than 90% agreement for disclosure of payments to healthcare professionals. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve gone a bit further and said if we can\u2019t agree on disclosure, then we won\u2019t work with those individuals.\u201d However, it\u2019s vital to keep the end goal of transparency in mind, said Dr Graham Jackson of NHS Clinical Commissioners. \u201cWhat\u2019s our point? What\u2019s our outcome? If our outcome is to provide service design, workload design, research and products that lead to better outcomes for our population across the NHS, then it\u2019s fine to have this relationship [with pharmaceutical companies] and I\u2019m much happier with this relationship within a transparent environment.\u201d  Eric Low of cancer charity Myeloma UK agreed: \u201cThe reason that we collaborate, the reason that we speak to each other, the reason that we educate, the reason that we compete internationally to get clinical trials to the UK is because we care about our patients. And it would be unthinkable for me, as leader of a patient organisation, to not work with industry in such a critical role.\u201d Collaboration on clinical trials He added that he\u2019s \u201cnot frightened at all\u201d of disclosure. Myeloma UK collaborates with industry in clinical trials, and gets free drugs from industry to use in those trials. For one trial, that might be \u00a36m to \u00a37m worth of drugs. \u201cIf you look at that as a proportion of our turnover, that could raise some eyebrows. But we should celebrate it. There\u2019s nothing inappropriate about that relationship.\u201d But GP Dr Margaret McCartney pointed out that talking about shared goals, partnership and collaboration is all very well \u2013 but what are the shared goals and who decides what they are? She cited the pharmaceutical researcher who had approached her practice to do clinical research. When McCartney asked him if results would be published no matter what they showed, she was told no, and that McCartney herself would not be allowed to make them public. \u201cHow can I trust a leadership that says it will not guarantee published results, no matter what they show?\u201d she asked.  She went on to highlight \u201cmorally distressing\u201d practice around patient data. Drug companies, she said, are paying for independent pharmacists to go into GP surgeries, audit patient notes and make recommendations for treatment. Their patients have not given consent for this. \u201cMany GPs seem to be happy with this. As a patient, I am not happy with this. Patient groups are not happy with this. I think we should fund the NHS to do this work. I do not think we should allow external people, who have a vested interest in prescribing and medication, freedom of access to your notes. I think that\u2019s wrong, and that debate hasn\u2019t been had.\u201d This kind of poor practice, the panel agreed, is unacceptable and should be reported to the appropriate authorities such as the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA), which operates the ABPI Code of Practice for the Pharmaceutical Industry.  So should disclosure be required by law? McCartney said she was pleased with GSK\u2019s advances in making clinical data public, but believed that the process has to be \u201censhrined in law\u201d. Others were not so sure: Jackson was concerned with \u201cover-sterilisation\u201d of the system. There are conflicts and competing interests in many areas, he pointed out, not just in pharmaceutical company funding, and a certain amount of competing interests are inevitable. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature, and if we legislate, and go too far, then we could end up stifling the system by not allowing it to breathe.\u201d Comments from the audience expanded on the theme of drug companies versus doctors: Joe Taylor, a medical doctor by training and a lecturer at the University of Oxford, said that, like most doctors, he wasn\u2019t up to date on every single study, and that incentivisation from pharmaceutical companies could force him to re-evaluate his prescribing practice. \u201cCould it be that incentivisation is a positive thing and could be misinterpreted by patients?\u201d he asked. McCartney disagreed, saying doctors didn\u2019t need incentives from drug companies to do their job well. But a general belief that drug companies are the bad guys could actually make people reluctant to disclose, said Robert Miller, chief medical officer and managing partner at Artemida Pharma. \u201cI applaud full disclosure but I think one of the reasons why people are probably not prepared to fully disclose in some areas is because of the vilification of the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can work with pharma and not think of them as an evil empire, then people will be much happier to disclose.\u201d Transparency in the interest of patients But times are changing, said Soni. \u201cThe industry did have a very bad reputation and there is no doubt that it earned it. Some of the things it did were not in the interests of patients or for the best interests of care. However, the industry has changed \u2013 it\u2019s had to. It had to realise some of the things it was doing were not of a suitable standard. And I think this is helping us to move further and further in the right direction.\u201d Freeman took up this theme in his keynote address, praising not just the \u201cextraordinary\u201d NHS but also the contribution made by pharmaceutical companies to both the economy and to patient care. For him, transparency is right at the heart of the challenges and opportunities faced by the NHS \u2013 the \u201coil\u201d of the 21st\u2013century healthcare landscape. And he painted a picture of a future NHS driven by what Jeremy Hunt calls \u201cintelligent transparency\u201d, free of paper and cardboard, and using its own daily data footprint to improve its own performance and improvement.  He sensed, he said, great opportunity and excitement around transparency. \u201cWe have a choice between historically justifiable conspiracy theory, distrust and legislation as the only solution \u2013 the law or the threat of law, which I think drives defensiveness \u2013 or an approach based on mutual respect for others\u2019 perspectives. [That approach] will accelerate us into this landscape of a more transparent healthcare ecosystem, which I think is genuinely in the interests of all of us.\u201d On the panel  Sarah Boseley (Chair) Health editor, the Guardian Virginia Acha Executive director, research, medical and innovation, ABPI Dr Graham Jackson Co-chair, NHS Clinical Commissioners Eric Low Chief executive, Myeloma UK Dr Margaret McCartney GP and broadcaster Ash Soni, President, Royal Pharmaceutical Society Nikki Yates General manager, GlaxoSmithKline   This article was amended on 18 May 2016 to clarify that the 90% agreement for disclosure stated by Nikki Yates of GSK referred to disclosure of payments to healthcare professionals.
