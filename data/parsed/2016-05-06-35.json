  "body": "A New York-based dance troupe has accused China of forcing the cancellation of its shows in South Korea over its links to a banned spiritual movement that Beijing calls \u201can evil cult\u201d intent on \u201cmind control\u201d. Shen Yun, a performing company affiliated with the Falun Gong movement, accused China\u2019s government of shutting down their shows in Seoul. The Chinese government maintains that the troupe is \u201ca political tool\u201d of Falun Gong. This week a Seoul court let a theater cancel four shows by the company, which provided a translation of the court order. The venue, KBS Hall, is owned by Korea\u2019s national broadcasting company, one of the few companies Beijing lets air foreign television in China. The court order cited a letter from the Chinese embassy in Seoul, which warned the theater about \u201ca huge loss\u201d should China revoke broadcasting rights. Shen Yun also provided a copy of the January letter, written on embassy letterhead.  The legal battle over the shows began when the company that booked Shen Yun asked the courts to let the troupe perform over the theater\u2019s cancellation. In reply to a request for comment, the Chinese government in Washington sent a link to a page about Shen Yun\u2019s links to the \u201canti-society cult\u201d Falun Gong, and said the movement\u2019s founder, Li Hongzhi, ordered the performances. According to the troupe, a Seoul court said on 19 April that they could perform, but then reversed its decision on 4 May after another letter from the Chinese embassy.

Lemish said that not only had thousands of tickets sold for the four planned performances, but that the company would now have to endure travel and hotel costs for its 80-some members. Falun Gong was banned in China in 1999, and human rights groups have for more than a decade criticized Beijing for repressing practitioners and mischaracterizing the movement with the \u201cevil cult\u201d language. Lemish also said that the letters follow a pattern of harassment and intimidation by Chinese government officials, dating back to the company\u2019s inception in 2006. Most of these attempts to shut down performances have gone in vain, he said, and a handful have seen documents leaked to the public.  In 2008, for instance, China\u2019s consulate general in Los Angeles wrote a letter to a local official saying that certain dances \u201cdefame China\u2019s image in the international community and undermine the development of US-China relations\u201d. The local government rejected the call to cancel the performances. Beijing\u2019s outposts abroad have also taken their opposition to Shen Yun public over the years. In 2009 China\u2019s consulate in Chicago called the troupe \u201ca political tool\u201d of \u201cevil cult Falun Gong\u201d. The consulate then described some of Shen Yun\u2019s songs and dances, which mimic qigong \u2013 slow, meditative exercises practiced by many Buddhists and Taoists. Consulate officials accused Shen Yun of \u201cpropaganda\u201d that uses a message of compassion and peace to disguise \u201cthe truth and to realize their evil purpose of exerting mind control over them\u201d. In 2000 the embassy in Washington DC accused Falun Gong\u2019s founder, Li Hongzhi, of tax evasion, and said his prophecies drove people so \u201cinsane\u201d that they \u201ceven committed suicide or killed their loved ones\u201d. The consulate also objected to Shen Yun\u2019s publicizing \u201cthe \u2018persecution\u2019 on Falun Gong\u201d.  Chinese adherents have said that thousands of practitioners have been detained, abused and even killed since 1999. Beijing has repeatedly rejected visa requests for practitioners living abroad, including for Shen Yun. \u201cWe\u2019re very open about the fact that there\u2019s a connection between Shen Yun and Falun Gong,\u201d Lemish said, admittedly that \u201cseveral performers are practitioners\u201d and that shows do \u201cdepict the persecution of Falun Gong and the courage of Falun Gong practitioners\u201d.  But he insisted that those sections are \u201cnot the majority of the performance\u201d, but rather \u201cjust a part of the legends and genesis of Chinese culture as it goes through different dynasties, cultures, ethnic groups, into contemporary China\u201d. The troupe\u2019s mission, according to Lemish, is to \u201crevive this lost heritage, a very spiritual world\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re opposed to it because we\u2019re putting on stage something that they\u2019ve spent the last 17 years pretending isn\u2019t happening,\u201d he added.  Lemish also said that the troupe has felt fewer attempts to cancel shows in recent years, perhaps because of western officials\u2019 tendency to ignore censorship demands. The letters were indicative of the communist party\u2019s tense and often confrontational relationship with religious groups, he said, as well as \u201cthe long arm of Chinese censorship\u201d that seeks to silence the Dalai Lama, artist Ai Weiwei and others.\u201cAll of this is actually quite funny if you\u2019re not stuck in a hotel and supposed to be performing.\u201d",
