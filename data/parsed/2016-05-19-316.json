Children have become a preferred target for traffickers, the report warns, amid growing concern over the fate of unaccompanied child refugees who have disappeared from official view since arriving in Europe. Almost 96,000 unaccompanied children claimed asylum in Europe in 2015, about one-fifth of the total number of child refugees. But at least 10,000 unaccompanied children have dropped off the radar of official agencies since arriving in Europe, the EU police agency reported in January. German authorities reported earlier this year that 4,700 children had been lost to officials, while up to 10 children a week are reported missing in Sweden. The report from the European commission, which will be published on Thursday, does not attempt to estimate how many may have fallen victim to criminal gangs, but warns that the phenomenon of child trafficking \u201chas been exacerbated by the ongoing migration crisis\u201d. Children are at high risk of being doubly victimised, it says, because they are treated as perpetrators of crimes if they are found by the authorities. \u201cOrganised crime groups choose to traffic children as they are easy to recruit and quick to replace, they can also keep under their control child victims relatively cheaply and discreetly,\u201d states an EU working document seen by the Guardian. Trafficked children aged between six months and 10 years are bought and sold for sums ranging from \u20ac4,000 (\u00a33,000) to \u20ac8,000, although amounts of up to \u20ac40,000 have been reported in some cases. EU authorities registered 15,846 victims of human trafficking in 2013-14, including 2,375 children, but the report\u2019s authors believe the true number of victims is far higher. More than two-thirds (67%) of people were trafficked into sex work; about one-fifth (21%) were put into forced labour, often as agricultural workers, a form of slavery that disproportionately affected men. The remainder of trafficking victims faced an equally grim catalogue of exploitation, ranging from domestic servitude to forced begging. The authors sounded the alarm about the \u201cworryingly sharp increase\u201d in Nigerian women and girls arriving in Italy from Libya. The Italian authorities have reported a 300% year-on-year increase in the number of Nigerian victims of trafficking. Traffickers are increasingly exploiting legal migration routes by persuading non-EU nationals to apply for asylum or a residence permit. More than two-thirds of the identified victims were EU nationals, with the largest numbers coming from Romania, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Hungary and Poland. The remainder came from all over the world, with Nigerians, Chinese and Albanians especially prominent. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP, said official statistics on this \u201cvile trade\u201d were just the tip of the iceberg. Victims of trafficking come to official attention when they are arrested or escape, she said. \u201cVery, very few are rescued by the authorities and for me that is shocking.\u201d Too often, police forces \u201csee the crime, not the person, they see them as illegal immigrants\u201d. The MEP, who spearheaded an anti-trafficking resolution in the European parliament last month, said EU authorities needed to do more to rescue victims and help them recover.  EU law requires countries to provide victims of trafficking with at least 30 days of recovery, including accommodation, medical treatment and legal advice. The UK offers a 45-day \u201creflection period\u201d, when the person cannot be deported. The MEP would like to see a longer period for recovery. Highlighting the plight of people sold into in sex slavery she said: \u201cWe are much better now at treating people who are raped and give them the protection of the law, but these girls have been raped night after night after night. I think we should be prepared to give them longer support of reflection and more support in rebuilding their lives.\u201d  She also urged governments to get to grips with the migration crisis. \u201cWhen the migrants land on Europe\u2019s shores, when they are not properly looked after, they are absolutely ripe victims for the traffickers.\u201d Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee task force, said the EU played a central role in the fight against human trafficking: \u201cBeing in the EU gives our police the tools they need to bring evil human trafficking gangs to justice, including vital cooperation through Europol.\u201d In the past year, 250 suspected human traffickers have been arrested in joint operations supported by Europol, the EU police agency. Cooper said: \u201cLeaving Europe would be a gift to criminals that would weaken our efforts to stamp out this evil trade.\u201d",
