  "body": "My friend and colleague Stephen Eyers, who has died aged 73, was an English teacher and adviser of teachers. We met in 1974, on my first day at Vauxhall Manor school in Lambeth, south London, one of the best comprehensives in the capital at the time, where he had been working since 1972. Vauxhall Manor\u2019s staff regarded the language and culture of the school\u2019s working class, ethnically diverse students as something to value and build upon. The English department invited poets into the school, took parties to Italy, and ran frequent visits to theatres in London, Oxford and Stratford-upon-Avon. Exam results were among the best in London for comparable schools and Stephen made a major contribution to these achievements. Between 1974 and 1979, a group of colleagues teaching a range of subjects at the school produced a series of papers documenting our students\u2019 language and learning. These were combined in a book entitled Becoming Our Own Experts, which Stephen and I edited. The book, now available online, achieved a certain reputation nationally as an example of \u201caction research\u201d: the idea that practitioners could also be theorists of learning, rather than mere recipients of theoretical ideas handed down from higher education. From 1984 to 1989, Stephen taught at St Martin-in-the-Fields school for girls, also in Lambeth and then, until 1995, worked as a teacher adviser, inspiring hundreds of younger colleagues through his understanding of education as a partnership between teacher and learner in which, over time, the teacher gains as much as the learner. From 1995 to 2004 Stephen worked in the NHS as an external adviser for Kent, Surrey and Sussex. He had no medical training, but knew how to help doctors improve their teaching of younger colleagues at the bedside. \u201cMore humanity, less humiliation,\u201d he used to say. His last job, from 2004 to 2013, was at Kingston University in London, where he helped student teachers enter the profession through a variety of alternative routes, including from overseas. A lifelong socialist, Stephen once gave me a photocopied A4 sheet. Its top half was evidence that a student of his had, at the age of 11, failed the Schonell reading test. Its bottom half was the citation for the student\u2019s PhD, gained 13 years later. Underneath he had written: \u201cAnybody may be capable of anything.\u201d He met his second wife, Theresa Cato, also a teacher, at Vauxhall Manor, and they were married in 1995. He is survived by Theresa, by his children, Jake and Chloe, from his first marriage, to Jeannie (nee Dickens), which ended in divorce, and by his stepson, Paul, and his sister, Joy.",
