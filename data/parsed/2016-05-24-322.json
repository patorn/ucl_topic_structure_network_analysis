  "body": "The Melbourne Cup-winning jockey Michelle Payne will undergo tests on her pancreas and liver after suffering a heavy fall during a race in Mildura on Monday afternoon. Payne, who was riding her brother Patrick\u2019s horse Dutch Courage in race seven of the meet in Victoria, was taken by ambulance to Mildura base hospital for observation after complaining of severe abdominal pain.   Related: 'Get stuffed': how Michelle Payne and family beat odds to win Melbourne Cup    Despite being given a tentative all-clear, she later tweeted that she would have to attend the Alfred hospital in Melbourne for further tests on Tuesday. Victorian Jockeys Association chief executive Des O\u2019Keeffe sought to reassure fans of Payne, who became the first woman to ride to Melbourne Cup victory in 2015, and play down the severity of her injuries. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing urgent or too dramatic, it\u2019s more of a precautionary move,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not at the top of her game, but she\u2019s going really good. \u201cThey are riding 500kg animals at 60km/h in a field, it is always going to be a dangerous job, but it\u2019s as safe as can be \u2013 they wear vests, they wear safety helmets.\u201d Payne\u2019s father, Paddy, said she had landed underneath her horse and taken a kick to the stomach. The jockey was fortunate to have been riding at the back of the field with no other horses behind her at the time of the fall. \u201cShe told me she got a kick in the guts but she can\u2019t remember much else about the fall,\u201d Paddy Payne said. \u201cShe said she was going OK, but her stomach was hurting. \u201cShe sounded a bit down as it\u2019s marred a good weekend for her. Unfortunately it\u2019s just one of those things and it\u2019s always on the cards in racing.\u201d Earlier in the day, Payne had ridden two winners and placed second three times for her brother.  Last weekend she rode Prince of Penzance \u2013 the 100-1 shot she paired with to win the 2015 Melbourne Cup \u2013 to second place at the RA Lee Stakes in Morphettville, the gelding\u2019s first outing since last year\u2019s famous victory at Flemington Racecourse.",
