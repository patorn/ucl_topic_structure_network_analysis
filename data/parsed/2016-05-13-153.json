  "body": "Jose Velasquez, weary from picking cherries, was heading home on a battered bike this week with signs of a tough day etched across his face: dust, sunburn and little red marks all over. And now a reporter is telling the 35-year-old that the World Health Organisation had just identified this baked corner of California as having the country\u2019s worst air pollution. \u201cReally?\u201d Velasquez sighed, tipping up his hat. Then he shrugged. Of all life\u2019s challenges \u2013 feeding his family and paying rent top of the list \u2013 this seemed less urgent.  \u201cThe pollution is really bad, sure. But I don\u2019t have a problem with it. Today I had thousands of ants on me, biting me everywhere. I had to throw my sweater in the garbage.\u201d You might think landing on the nation\u2019s pollution top spot would upset the residents of Visalia-Porterville, an agricultural valley between San Francisco and Los Angeles. You might think laborers who work outdoors, inhaling the contaminated the air, would be angriest. Pollution is blamed for high rates of cancer, asthma and hundreds of premature deaths each year. But in interviews, laborers and other residents expressed resignation. The air is bad? Yep. And the poverty is worse. Carmen Perez, 59, who clips vine leaves, said she spent two weeks in hospital last year with a throat infection and fever. Once back on her feet, she immediately returned to the vineyards, where she has worked for 15 years earning minimum wage. Her six children work there too. \u201cWe all get coughs and other problems. A lot of phlegm.\u201d Asked about possible solutions, Perez, a migrant from Mexico who speaks only Spanish, did not consider pollution reduction measures. \u201cMasks. We\u2019d like some masks.\u201d She mulled a bit more. \u201cAnd gloves. Gloves would be great.\u201d Appearances can deceive in the San Joaquin valley, a stretch of fertile farmland that grows much of the US\u2019s fruits, nuts and vegetables \u2013 earning it the nickname \u201cAmerica\u2019s salad bowl\u201d. From certain hilltops the landscape can appear an Eden. But up close you can see the drought-baked soil and intensive irrigation, and can often smell the chemicals and pesticides.  On bad days you see the haze and feel the sting in your throat, revealing nature\u2019s trick: the topography acts as a bowl and temperature inversion acts as a lid, trapping tainted air. Multiple sources contribute: farming and oil drilling; traffic on Interstate 5 and Highway 99; winds blowing contaminants from the bay area, Los Angeles and even Asia.     Hazy skies in Porterville: \u2018On bad days you see the haze and feel the sting in your throat.\u2019 Photograph: Dan Tuffs for the Guardian    The WHO report published on Thursday said outdoor air pollution had grown 8% globally in the past five years, with billions of people now exposed to dangerous air.  The United Nations\u2019 health agency linked Visalia and Porterville, two small cities 30 miles apart in the San Joaquin valley, to identify the US\u2019s dirtiest urban center.  Visalia\u2019s official website shows bucolic scenery and the motto \u201cgateway to the sequoias\u201d, while Porterville has emblazoned its name on walls, proclaiming it an \u201call-American city\u201d. Haze may be a more apt symbol, as doubts hang over efforts to counter pollution. Officially the result is a huge success. But some critics consider the campaign a mirage. The San Joaquin valley air pollution control district, a 15-member board comprising mainly elected officials, heads the clean-up under the motto \u201cleading the way to a clearer future\u201d. In an interview Seyed Sadredin, the executive director, said that since 1980 the region had reduced pollutants that form ozone and particulate matter by 80% \u2013 a credit to local businesses, notably agriculture and oil, which spent $40bn and absorbed more than 600 regulations. \u201cWe have the most stringent regulations in the US.\u201d     The topography of the San Joaquin valley traps pollutants in the air above Porterville and Visalia. Photograph: Dan Tuffs for the Guardian    But some health and environmental advocates dispute this narrative and say that, in reality, the air pollution control district represents business interests that prize profits over clean air. \u201cThey are conspiring to change the standards so things don\u2019t look as dirty as they are,\u201d said Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California.  Tom Frantz, a farmer and veteran environmental activist, said the district reflected the valley\u2019s Republican-led establishment, which was funded by local industry. \u201cThey don\u2019t represent the poor farm workers who are out in the fields. They downplay the harm that air pollution causes.\u201d Kevin Hamilton, a respiratory therapist who heads the Central California Asthma Collaborative, said the district acted only when compelled by litigation, and even then tried to protect corporate interests, creating \u201cloopholes in the law that you can drive a truck through\u201d. Critics say the authority has revealed its true colors by backing the Clean Air Act modernisation bill, which they consider an attempt to lower standards and weaken protections. It is sponsored by Republican Kevin McCarthy, the US House majority leader. He is from Bakersfield, part of the San Joaquin valley. Sadredin, the air pollution control district\u2019s executive director, said the bill was a sensible attempt to update 46-year-old legislation which creates costly bureaucracy.  He denied being an industry shill and said critics were misguided. \u201cThere is an extremist minority that basically always claims the sky is falling without recognising improvements.\u201d Bonnie Holmes-Gen, senior director of air quality and climate change at the American Lung Association in California, agreed that big drops in bad ozone and particle days showed important progress. But she lamented the district was resisting federal clean air standards: \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d The association gave the valley an F in its annual \u201cstate of the air\u201d report. The valley has the US\u2019s highest asthma rate for children, delivering a stream of patients to Nabil Abbassi, a doctor at a clinic for low-income residents in Delano run by the nonprofit Clinica Sierra Vista. \u201cThey complain they are exposed to dust and fumes,\u201d said Abbassi. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s not much they can do about it.\u201d     The San Joaquin valley has the nation\u2019s highest asthma rate for children. Photograph: Dan Tuffs for the Guardian    On a recent day in Porterville, half a dozen boys played baseball in a park as dusk approached; a glimpse of apparent normality, but it turned out that half the team was missing. \u201cThere\u2019s about six kids at home. Summer\u2019s coming so even on a good day it can be hard for some of them to breathe,\u201d said the coach, Matthew O\u2019Neal. Abe Giron, 35, a father watching from the sidelines, counted himself and his son lucky. His grandfather and father labored in the fields so that he, the third generation, could go to college and get a good job as a state hospital nurse.  \u201cThe ones who work outdoors, who pick our fruits and vegetables, they\u2019re the ones paying the price of pollution.\u201d They would continue to do so, said Giron, because they had no choice. \u201cNot going out to work, that\u2019s not an option.\u201d",
