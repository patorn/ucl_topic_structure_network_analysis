  "body": "\u201cGood afternoon, your Majesty,\u201d said David Cameron. \u201cI hope your preparations for world war three are going well.\u201d \u201cAnd what do you do?\u201d the Queen asked. It was a fair question. In recent weeks Dave had abandoned any pretence of running his U-turns R Us government in favour of racing round the country predicting global warfare and Ebola outbreaks. But every prime minister deserves time off from world annihilation to shoot the breeze with the Queen and the archbishop of Canterbury.   Related: Afghanistan and Nigeria 'possibly most corrupt countries', Cameron lets slip    \u201cNothing much,\u201d said Dave idly. \u201cThough we have got this anti-corruption conference coming up at the end of the week. It should be a right laugh. We have got the Nigerians \u2013 actually we have got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain. If you\u2019ve invited any of them to dinner at the palace, I advise you to keep the silver locked up or you\u2019ll be totally cleaned out by the end of the evening.\u201d \u201cYou do realise that ITV is actually recording this conversation,\u201d Justin Welby whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d said Dave. \u201cI\u2019d never be caught making unguarded comments that could embarrass the Queen.\u201d \u201cI seem to remember you telling the world that I purred after the Scottish referendum. For the record, one has never purred,\u201d the monarch interjected. \u201cWell, there was that. Though I could have sworn that you did actually purr,\u201d Dave recalled. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain the ITV cameras are rolling,\u201d Welby interrupted, a little more urgently than before. \u201cDon\u2019t be so paranoid, Justin,\u201d said Dave. \u201cJust because there\u2019s a film crew pointing a camera in our direction it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re actually working. Now come on Ma\u2019am, let\u2019s have some fun. You must have met some fairly corrupt people in your travels round the world. So who\u2019s in your top 10 bent tyrants? Surely President Mugabe must be right up there.\u201d Throughout these exchanges, Chris Grayling had kept silent but now he couldn\u2019t resist joining in. \u201cAs the EU is the most corrupt organisation in the world, Angela Merkel and President Hollande must be well up there,\u201d the leader of the Commons said. \u201cOh do give the EU a rest, Grayling. Back to you, Ma\u2019am. If you won\u2019t give us 10 then at least give us your top three.\u201d The Queen said nothing so Dave decided to give her a helping hand. \u201cCome on, Ma\u2019am. There\u2019s a fantastic group to choose from. How about Nigeria and Afghanistan \u2013 possibly two of the most corrupt countries in the world?\u201d Aware the ITV cameras were actually recording this conversation and that Dave might have misjudged the Queen\u2019s willingness to have a laugh, Welby sought to steer a more diplomatic line. \u201cBut this particular president is actually not corrupt,\u201d he observed. Dave shrugged. The archbishop was such a pedant sometimes. So big deal that Nigeria was only in 31st place in the corruption league table, with North Korea and Somalia way out in the lead. And so what if the Nigerian president wasn\u2019t corrupt? There were plenty of other people in Nigeria who were up to their necks in some of the most brilliant corruption. \u201cThey are coming at their own expense, I assume,\u201d said Speaker Bercow. A frown crossed Dave\u2019s face. That was a good point. But, when you came to think about it, they wouldn\u2019t actually be paying a penny because the British government had actually increased its international aid to Nigeria and Afghanistan by 30% in the last year. \u201cEverything has to be open,\u201d Dave said, reminding himself to make sure that some of Britain\u2019s better tax havens were kept off the anti-corruption conference agenda. First world corruption was wholly different to the help yourself loot and pillage free-for-all of the developing world. Face it. No one in their right mind would go on holiday to Afghanistan. But the British Virgin Islands were simply glorious at this time of year. Just as the Queen drew her hand across her throat to signify that the conversation was now officially over, Ken Livingstone came bursting into Buckingham Palace. \u201cI\u2019ve been told there\u2019s a TV camera in here,\u201d said Ken. \u201cNo there isn\u2019t,\u201d said Dave. \u201cYes there is,\u201d said Justin. \u201cThank God for that,\u201d Ken gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s been at least four days since I\u2019ve last been near one and I\u2019ve been going cold turkey. Now where is it?\u201d \u201cOver there,\u201d said Justin. \u201cHitler.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHitler.\u201d \u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d \u201cHave you invited Hitler to your anti-corruption summit?\u201d \u201cEr, he died at the end of the second world war,\u201d said Dave. \u201cMy focus is very firmly on the next world war.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just what I would have expected from a global Zionist plot,\u201d Ken snarled. Dave nodded. That was another item to add to his anti-corruption agenda.",
