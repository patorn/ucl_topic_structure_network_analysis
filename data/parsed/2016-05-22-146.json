  "body": "Isabelle Huppert is known to have a certain self-awareness regarding the way she looks. But we\u2019re not talking about the kind of vanity you might conventionally be tempted to ascribe to film stars. With this outstanding French screen and stage actor, it\u2019s more a precise analytical interest in her appearance and the meaning it can convey. She once said, \u201cIn a close-up, a flicker of the eyelids is a major event\u201d \u2013 and in so many of her films that flicker, or the slightest tense moue at the corner of the mouth can have a profoundly eloquent, even seismic effect. Her body and her face are among the precision tools of her trade, so it\u2019s understandable that she takes a hands-on interest in her relation with the camera, whether it\u2019s shooting film or stills. So when I walk into her dressing room at Paris\u2019s historic Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Od\u00e9on, Huppert has her glasses on and is huddling over the Observer photographer\u2019s laptop, peering intently at the portraits he\u2019s just taken of her and giving firm opinions on which do and don\u2019t work. \u201cNon \u2013 too hard. Not this one, it makes me look like I\u2019m missing a leg. This one\u2019s good. But you\u2019d have to crop it here.\u201d I\u2019d love to be able to report on exactly how Huppert uses those finely tuned features in the stage performance she is about to bring to London\u2019s Barbican. But I arrive in Paris to find that this evening\u2019s performance of Phaedra(s), her current spectacle at the Od\u00e9on, has been cancelled because the theatre is occupied by demonstrating intermittents du spectacle \u2013 arts workers protesting against proposed cuts to the benefits that they receive while not working. That this system exists is testament to the enlightened attitude towards culture that still operates in France, although it\u2019s apparent that a certain irritation towards the cause exists backstage at the Od\u00e9on, the show\u2019s director Krzysztof Warlikowski having decided it was impossible to stage Phaedra(s) during the occupation.     Isabelle Huppert on stage in Phaedra(s) in Paris. The play comes to London\u2019s Barbican next month, complete with surtitles. \u2018You will understand,\u2019 Huppert promises. Photograph: Pascal Victor/ArtComArt    In the event, all I have seen of the production is a somewhat blurry video recording in which Huppert and her fellow actors appear as murky figures in the stage landscape. But I can report that, vocally and physically, Huppert gives a performance radically at odds with the minimalism we often associate with her screen roles. There are eldritch screams, agonised physical contortions, highly formal enunciations of speeches and stage directions alike. The theme is the classical story of Phaedra, the queen who falls passionately for her stepson Hippolytus \u2013 as told by Euripides, Seneca and most famously Racine. Polish director Warlikowski\u2019s version of the myth mixes the classics with a new text by Lebanese writer Wadji Mouawad, chunks of JM Coetzee\u2019s 2003 essay-novel Elizabeth Costello and the entirety of the late Sarah Kane\u2019s characteristically brutal 1996 play Phaedra\u2019s Love. Containing dance sequences, video projections, an extremely mobile stage set and a radically decentred approach to its ostensible subject, Phaedra(s) is a full-on multi-media assault that will startle theatregoers expecting a classic tale classically told. It has, I suggest to Huppert, very little to do with the British theatre tradition. \u201cOr with the French theatre tradition,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s say that Warlikowski has his own world.\u201d This is the second time she has worked with the director; their last collaboration was a version of A Streetcar Named Desire set in a mental hospital, with Blanche DuBois as a literature professor reciting Flaubert and Euripides.    I don't particularly think about Phaedra the character. We know what her problem is. She's in love with her stepson    Sitting in her dressing room \u2013 trim at just over 5ft, in black trousers and boots and a white couture jumper \u2013 Huppert lives up to one of her reputations. I don\u2019t mean the version that depicts her as a chilly, forbidding figure, but certainly the one that presents her as unashamedly cerebral, an alert and acute thinker who doesn\u2019t squander words. French actors in particular can be a little vaporous in interview as they weave poetic abstractions around the intangibles of their art, but with Huppert, speaking in French, you feel you\u2019re getting a very considered tutorial. On Sarah Kane, whose demanding 4.48 Psychosis she performed in 2002, Huppert says, \u201cHer language is the language of consciousness. It\u2019s somehow cosmic, certainly in no sense realist.\u201d She explains how the different levels of Phaedra(s) fit together. \u201cWadji Mouawad gives us a geopolitical Phaedra \u2013 a Phaedra torn from her roots, who reminds us of the struggles of immigrants, people who\u2019ve lost their land and are dealing with the deaths of those close to them. Sarah Kane gives us a bourgeois family stifling under the weight of secrecy, lies and shame. And Coetzee\u2019s Phaedra isn\u2019t really Phaedra but an intellectual giving a lecture on female desire, on the relationships between men and gods.\u201d Phaedra, Huppert commented in a recent French interview, \u201cis less a character than an idea\u201d. What, for her, is the difference? \u201cWhen I do a performance like this, I\u2019m not particularly thinking about Phaedra the character. Everyone already knows what her problem is. She\u2019s in love with her stepson, who isn\u2019t her son, so it\u2019s transgression but not quite incest \u2013 and maybe that makes it worse.\u201d With mythical figures, you\u2019re dealing with readymades, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Madame Bovary\u201d \u2013 whom Huppert played in a Claude Chabrol film of 1991 \u2013 \u201cMadame Bovary is ennui, depression, unrealisable dreams. And Phaedra is burning desire, desire associated with death. That means you can very easily move away from the story, from the anecdote,\u201d she says, giving the word the very faintest hint of contempt. There\u2019s no denying that Phaedra(s) is a challenging piece, both in its kinetic, confrontational staging, and in its dense flood of text, performed in a heightened, non-naturalistic manner; in the Kane section, Huppert recites the stage directions aloud in a haunted, robotic style. Some French critics admitted to being mystified by the show. So how will it go down in London, accompanied by surtitles? \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of surtitled performances, and I\u2019ve done a lot of them,\u201d Huppert says. \u201cSometimes it can really open things up, because a surtitle can\u2019t give you everything. In theatre it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s something else that transmits meaning \u2013 our imagination can take its cue from vision alone. For me, it\u2019s not a problem if I see a play and I can\u2019t understand anything at all \u2013 it can be fun. Here, you won\u2019t understand nothing \u2013 you will understand.\u201d     Huppert with G\u00e9rard Depardieu in Loulou (1980). Photograph: Alamy    Huppert clearly feels at home in an abstracted, experimental realm of theatre; the last time I saw her on stage in Paris was in a super-austere version of Hedda Gabler, in which she spent nearly the whole evening standing motionless on a stage resembling a Japanese lacquered platform. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very rich experience in theatre because of the stature of the directors I\u2019ve worked with.\u201d She reels off a list of names including Bob Wilson, Peter Zadek, Yasmina Reza. But her debut in theatre was a little more rough and ready. Born in 1953 and raised in the Paris suburb of Ville-d\u2019Avray, Huppert is the daughter of an English teacher mother and a father who manufactured safes. She studied at the Paris Conservatoire and had an early stage stint at the start of the 70s working with her sisters, director Caroline and playwright Elisabeth. A particular hit was a cafe-theatre production of Elisabeth\u2019s play The True Story of Jack the Ripper. \u201cIt had a very long run \u2013 it was a pretty scandalous play. It imagined Jack as a woman, so you had this sapphic relationship between Jack and his victims. And in a cafe-theatre, you\u2019re very close to the audience, which makes for a very powerful eroticism.\u201d    All the directors whose debut features I\u2019ve made recently  turned out to be real film-makers \u2013 I have good intuition    Perhaps in a similar mode, Huppert will soon be seen in a French reworking of the Jekyll and Hyde story, Mrs Hyde, in which she plays Madame G\u00e9quil. Her husband in the film will be G\u00e9rard Depardieu, a screen partner from way back: in 1980, they made a striking star-crossed couple of social outsiders in Maurice Pialat\u2019s realist drama Loulou. Last year, one of the event movies in Cannes was their reunion after 35 years in Valley of Love, in which the actors play a divorced couple \u2013 named Isabelle and G\u00e9rard \u2013 summoned to California\u2019s Death Valley, seemingly by their dead son. It\u2019s a haunting figures-in-a-landscape drama, and an essay on time and physicality, with a trim, elegant, seemingly ageless Huppert, now 63, framed in the shadow of Depardieu\u2019s weary, gargantuan bulk. When I ask about the film, Huppert is more willing to talk about the locale than her co-star. \u201cThere are lots of tourists but you can get away \u2013 I went on some long walks, miles from anyone. It was a brilliant idea to set that story there \u2013 if they had met up in the Place de l\u2019Od\u00e9on, it wouldn\u2019t have been the same.\u201d As for working again with Depardieu, Huppert is almost dismissive about the legendary status of their reunion, which was so much the film\u2019s selling point. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re Marlene Dietrich and whoever.\u201d         Valley of Love trailer.    Huppert generally seems reticent to talk about other actors or collaborators. When I ask her about sharing a stage with Cate Blanchett in The Maids in Sydney and New York, she simply says they have very different acting styles, and turns the discussion to how strange it felt to be performing Jean Genet in English. On working with Patti Smith for a reading of the singer-poet\u2019s book Just Kids, she only says Smith has a fabulous voice whether singing or speaking. Huppert is more inclined to enthuse about directors; she has said that her only criterion for deciding to make a film is the desire to work with a particular person. In the course of a formidable \u2013 and sometimes relentlessly globe-trotting \u2013 career, she has chalked up a vast catalogue of illustrious auteur names. She has worked her way through the pantheon of major French directors: in recent years, Claire Denis, Catherine Breillat, Olivier Assayas, Fran\u00e7ois Ozon; before that, Jean-Luc Godard, Bertrand Tavernier and, repeatedly, Claude Chabrol. She has also collaborated with film-makers from Russia, Hungary, South Korea and the Philippines, as well as making a handful of films in the US, most famously Michael Cimino\u2019s maudit western Heaven\u2019s Gate (1980). And she regularly works with largely untested names on first or second features \u2013 much more than a star of her status might be expected to \u2013 a recent example being Belgian director Bavo Defurne, in whose forthcoming Souvenir she plays a forgotten Eurovision singer on the comeback trail. How does she know when a new name will have what it takes? She gives a casual shrug. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a bet I take, and I\u2019ve rarely been wrong. All the directors whose debut features I\u2019ve made in the past seven, eight years have turned out to be real film-makers \u2013 I have a good intuition.\u201d Huppert\u2019s latest film, however, is directed by a controversial A-lister \u2013 Paul Verhoeven. He\u2019s the Dutch provocateur who became one of the biggest names in 80s-90s Hollywood, specialising in abrasively violent science fiction (RoboCop, Starship Troopers) and sexually intense thrillers and melodramas such as Basic Instinct and the flamboyantly brassy Showgirls \u2013 a film widely regarded as a bad joke, yet viewed in France as a highly serious artistic statement. Premiered at Cannes, Verhoeven\u2019s French-language thriller Elle stars Huppert as the head of a computer games company reacting to rape by a mystery assailant. Judging by the trailer, it plays both on Huppert\u2019s skill at extreme emotion and on her fine command of inscrutability.     Huppert with Kris Kristofferson in Heaven\u2019s Gate (1980). Photograph: Courtesy Criterion Collection.    She loved working with Verhoeven, she says. \u201cThe film is really rich, very surprising and enigmatic. It\u2019s elusive. It\u2019s not a genre movie, but it\u2019s not a non-genre movie either \u2013 it floats somewhere between Chabrol and Hitchcock, but it\u2019s still a thousand per cent Verhoeven. There\u2019s also a sociological dimension. It\u2019s about a very contemporary woman, not a victim, but someone who bears up \u2013 only you don\u2019t see her bearing up. Things just happen to her and she lives through them, without complaining. You can\u2019t say she\u2019s a victim, or a heroine, or a woman of power \u2013 although she is a woman of power. All those categories distract us from reality, in a way.\u201d It\u2019s strange to think of Verhoeven \u2013 whose notoriety rests partly on a subliminal flash of Sharon Stone\u2019s crotch in Basic Instinct \u2013 making what sounds like a feminist film. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s strange \u2013 Showgirls was a major feminist film. In a way. He\u2019s certainly not misogynist.\u201d Perhaps a more overtly feminist statement is Things to Come, Huppert\u2019s collaboration with young French writer-director Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve, which premiered in February in the Berlin film festival. In it, Huppert gives a phenomenally vivid yet understated performance as a philosophy teacher going through separation from her husband and coping with her elderly mother\u2019s dementia. A middle-aged intellectual woman with complex depths, everyday emotional travails and a sense of humour \u2013 this is the sort of role that barely anyone writes these days. Only in France, you might say, and only from someone as astute as Hansen-L\u00f8ve, who made the French techno-generation film Eden, and who is herself the daughter of philosophers; Huppert says she essentially plays the director\u2019s mother. Does she, I wonder, ever feel less appreciated when playing ordinary women, rather than the characters she\u2019s often most closely associated with \u2013 such as the emotionally damaged musician in Michael Haneke\u2019s harrowing The Piano Teacher, or the murderous women of Chabrol\u2019s films (Violette Nozi\u00e8re, La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie)? \u201cNot at all,\u201d she says. \u201cMost of my characters are very, very ordinary women. Chabrol only ever cast me as fairly ordinary characters \u2013 they just have rather particular destinies.\u201d There\u2019s also the comic side of Huppert, seen in the lighter films that don\u2019t always get distributed in the UK. It sometimes comes as a surprise to see her letting her hair down and having fun, playing a confused tourist in the South Korean comedy In Another Country, or in Copacabana, a French film in which she plays a flighty ex-hippie holed up in Ostend, of all places. Viewers do tend to think of her on-screen persona as a full-on neurotic, steeped in psychosexual anguish. \u201cYes, but you can be a comic neurotic too.\u201d So does she feel underrated doing comedy? \u201cI certainly do feel\u2026\u201d she hesitates a moment; I take that as a yes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019d love to work with Woody Allen or Noah Baumbach \u2013 to do comedy in that New York vein.\u201d But her serious roles, she insists, often contain more humour than is apparent. \u201cEven The Piano Teacher \u2013 although I wouldn\u2019t try to persuade anyone that was an out and out comedy\u2026\u201d    I haven't started it yet but you can imagine what a Michael Haneke film called Happy Ending will be like    Next year, Huppert will be seen in another film with the austere Austrian maestro Haneke. \u201cI haven\u2019t started it yet. But you can imagine what a Michael Haneke film called Happy Ending will be like. You can imagine there will be a certain irony, a certain\u2026\u201d \u2013 she hesitates playfully, choosing her words \u2013 \u201cclear-sightedness. For me, the title says everything about how lucidly Haneke sees the world.\u201d Apparently it\u2019s about immigration, I hazard. \u201cApparently. That\u2019s not all there is to it. We\u2019ll see.\u201d The mention of immigration seems a good moment to steer Huppert on to political themes, although she is famous for being reserved on this terrain: she once told an interviewer, \u201cYou\u2019re not entitled to ask questions like, \u2018Who do you vote for?\u2019\u201d Given that the Od\u00e9on is, while we\u2019re speaking, surrounded by a police guard \u2013 even with a relatively small, quiet contingent of demonstrators in occupation \u2013 I ask how she feels about the general mood in Paris since the attacks at the Bataclan and elsewhere in November 2015. Huppert turns uncharacteristically vague. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s definitely less freedom of speech, less freedom tout court \u2013 you have to really be careful about what you say, it\u2019s very easy to be misunderstood, and that makes for a harmful climate. It\u2019s all a bit complicated. Still, you have to have faith in the future.\u201d I mention the rise of the right in France. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not just the right and the extreme right, there are problems on the left too, it\u2019s all a bit complicated\u2026\u201d And that\u2019s about as far as she\u2019ll go.      Huppert is also famously guarded when it comes to her personal life. She never discusses her husband, and the father of her three children, Ronald Chammah, whom she met when he directed her in a 1987 film called Milan Noir: \u201cThat\u2019s part of my private life,\u201d she firmly told me when I asked her about him years ago. Yet, given her reluctance to place her life in the media spotlight, I tell her I\u2019m surprised to see her all over the Paris newsstands on the cover of Psychologies magazine, together with her 32-year-old daughter Lolita Chammah, herself a rising screen actor. Huppert perks up. \u201cIs it out already?\u201d I pass her my copy. On the front are mother and daughter in a portrait that plays up their resemblance: both red-haired, both in identical white shirts, both gazing inscrutably at the camera. \u201cAh\u2026 C\u2019est belle la photo!\u201d she enthuses. Inside is a lengthy interview in which the pair discuss the pleasures and pains of the mother-daughter relationship. \u201cWhy did I do it? Does that surprise you? But I don\u2019t talk about my private life in it at all, it\u2019s all very general talk about a mother\u2019s relationship with her children \u2013 there are no details, no anecdotes.\u201d The interview does indeed maintain an amiable pitch of faux-revelatory vagueness: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been an anxious mother\u2026 more a strong, protective one,\u201d and so forth. They\u2019re clearly a strong team, in any case; Huppert and Lolita play a zesty comic turn as mother and daughter in Copacabana, and are about to play similar roles again. Admirers of Huppert on screen, then, should be prepared to abandon all preconceptions for Phaedra(s). They should probably abandon some of their preconceptions of theatre too \u2013 if the production is theatre, strictly speaking. \u201cFor me,\u201d Huppert says, \u201ctheatre is all about the possibility of not doing theatre. Very often in theatre, you think you\u2019re obliged to do certain things \u2013 but it really gets interesting when you\u2019re obliged to do precisely nothing. It\u2019s about placing writing and language somewhere other than they\u2019re usually supposed to go.\u201d And neither is her idea of the theatrical experience necessarily to do with emotion, she says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s moving or not, that\u2019s not really my problem. It\u2019s more the feeling of life.\u201d Phaedra(s) is at the Barbican, London EC1, 9-18 June. The production is part of the Lift festival, from 1 June-2 July. An Isabelle Huppert retrospective is at the Cin\u00e9 Lumiere, London SW7, till 12 June. Isabelle Huppert presents Barbara Loden\u2019s Wanda at the Whitechapel Gallery, 18 June",
