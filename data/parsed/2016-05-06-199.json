  "body": "When I was very young, my older sister Lucy was the singer. We\u2019d put on little shows and she\u2019d be up front, with me on backing vocals. She\u2019s a barrister now, and a brilliant performer \u2013 it\u2019s mesmerising to watch her talk. When I was 10, I was asked to sing Amazing Grace at a family friend\u2019s wedding. I was so scared that I made all 200 guests turn their chairs around so they weren\u2019t looking at me. I still get just as nervous today. Some people say that gives you an extra edge, but that\u2019s bollocks. It just makes me forget my words and wobble my notes. I\u2019m one of four siblings and there was lots of dressing up when we were little. Lucy and I insisted on being Cinderella and we\u2019d force our younger brother Harry to wear a horrible dress as the Ugly Sister, which he hated. We\u2019re still very close and they\u2019re always at my house in Devon, along with our brother Dan. Our parents, Wendy and Richard, taught us to be loyal, which is the most important thing for any family. We were encouraged to be very\u00a0open so we\u2019re an outspoken group of individuals. Mum was my manager when I first got a record contract at 15, but not in a Kardashian \u201cmomager\u201d kind of way. Basically I was parented, not managed. Her biggest concern was that I didn\u2019t get too tired. I\u2019ve never been comfortable with the weird nature of celebrity, but she and Dad kept me grounded. They split in 2005 but are on good terms, and Mum still only lives a couple of minutes away from me. She\u2019s\u00a0my best friend. I absolutely hated school. I\u2019m dyslexic and not enough was done to help kids like me. You need a different kind of teaching, because telling a kid \u201clearn this\u201d when they\u2019re feeling pissed off doesn\u2019t work. Mum and Dad were understanding about the fact that I wasn\u2019t academic and just said, \u201cThat\u2019s not your thing. You can do something else.\u201d My grammar has got better as I\u2019ve grown up. I didn\u2019t give a shit before, but now I want to learn and be taken seriously. As a teen, my parents were strict, and never let me go to pubs or clubs. I had parties with my friends in the field by our house and Mum always appeared with plates of chips. Really she was just checking we weren\u2019t drinking spirits. If she and Dad had known I was smoking weed at that age, they\u2019d have hung me. As I got older, I told them, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not what you make it out to be.\u201d It\u2019s an injustice that we don\u2019t talk about marijuana properly in Britain. I know people will read this and call me a silly hippie, but that plant can do so much good. It\u2019s sad, but my parents still hate me smoking it today. I\u2019ve got four dogs and they are my family too. There\u2019s Missy [Elliott], Dusty [Springfield], Igor and Margaret. I named her after my nan because she seemed fun and spirited like her. My nan\u2019s the kind who will sneak her head round the door and say, \u201cPass me a beer \u2013 and don\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d Poor Missy has been ill recently so I flew home from my tour in the Caribbean to be with her. She\u2019s got ulcers and had internal bleeding, but I think she\u2019s going to be fine, thank goodness. I\u2019m 30 next year but I\u2019ll probably just stay home with the dogs rather than throw a massive party. I\u2019m so boring. I don\u2019t go out much \u2013 I hate having to speak loudly over other people just to be heard. I always assumed I\u2019d have loads of children of my own, but at the moment it would be selfish. I\u2019m playing every country in the world on this tour and I\u2019m only at number 64. I couldn\u2019t drag a kid around everywhere with me.
