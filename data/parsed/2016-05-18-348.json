Australia\u2019s entrant Dami Im was the second favourite to win ahead of last Saturday\u2019s final, behind Russia. The 27-year-old from Brisbane, who came second, earned the most votes from judges with her entry Sound of Silence but fell short on the public vote, which gave the contest to Ukraine\u2019s Jamala and her highly political song 1944. Russia eventually placed third.            The rankings of five-person juries of music professionals from each of the 42 competing countries counted for 50% of the grand final outcome, with the other half determined by viewers at home. Fans and juries could not vote for their own country\u2019s entrant.   Related: Lies, damned lies, and Brexit statistics    This was the first time the winner was determined this way, after Eurovision changed its processes to \u201cinject new excitement\u201d into the television broadcast. But analysis by FiveThirtyEight shows that if the competition had been assessed under the old system, Im would have won. Previously, the rankings of the public and juries were pooled, then points were awarded based on the combined ranking. But this year, rankings-based points from judges and from voters were awarded separately. The popularity of what writer Leah Libresco dubbed Im\u2019s \u201csparkly-but-bland number\u201d with the juries would have beaten both Ukraine and Russia under the old system. Libresco also covered the \u201cgeopolitical intrigue\u201d provoked by Ukraine\u2019s winning entry: a politicised ballad about the 1944 deportation of the Crimean Tatars. The win sparked joy in Kiev and anger in Moscow, with the Ukraine president, Petro Poroshenko, thanking the singer Jamala on behalf of the whole country as Russia threatened to boycott next year\u2019s competition. The song\u2019s fairly explicit lyrics, wrote Libsresco, \u201cmade it pretty easy to guess which nations would leave Russia or Ukraine out of their top 10, based on their current relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u201d.

Poland also benefited from the new rules, placing eighth with only seven points from judges but more than 200 from fans \u2013 a result that, under the old system, would have led it to 19th place. Libresco reported that 21 countries\u2019 juries gave Russia no points \u2013 and 17 did the same to Ukraine. Australia did not feature in only three countries\u2019 top tens. \u201cIf these low rankings had been combined with residents\u2019 rankings to award points, Russia and Ukraine would have both wound up with more zeroes. \u201cInstead, the new system prevented Australia from beating all of Europe in its second year participating in the competition. The true victor, as it has been for decades, was complicated European bureaucracy.\u201d If Im had won the contest, Australia would have asked a European nation to host the next Eurovision on its behalf. Im has been contacted for comment.",
