  "body": "Working with Netflix and Amazon \u2013 it\u2019s all about creative freedom, right? Just ask Ricky Gervais, who said the freedom to do what he want was one of the reasons he made Special Correspondents with Netflix. Well, not all the time, if Whit Stillman\u2019s experience is anything to go by.  The Last Days of Disco director, who shot a pilot for the Chlo\u00eb Sevigny comedy drama The Cosmopolitans for Amazon, said: \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because the way they promote them now, they say, \u2018Oh they give people all this freedom and it\u2019s such a relief, it\u2019s just freedom, freedom, freedom.\u2019 It was a great experience, but freedom? They were on top of absolutely everything. Everything is a conversation.\u201d  Stillman, whose new film is the Jane Austen adaptation Love & Friendship, told the new issue of Sight & Sound magazine: \u201cIt turned out to be great, but I\u2019d never had any experience like that before.\u201d",
