  "body": "If there is one thing the sector can agree on, it is that the need for serious discussion about humanitarian response has never been greater. Over the past decade the number of people affected by humanitarian crisis has almost doubled. At the same time the money needed to resource effective action is dangerously lacking with a shortfall of billions. Many argue that the system is broken and it is time for creative, and even radical, reform.  There is little consensus however, on what this reform should be and how far it should go. In his outlining document for the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) in Istanbul, UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon set out five core responsibilities including a shift \u201cfrom delivering aid to ending need\u201d. There is also hope that the summit will deliver a transformation of aid financing dynamics in the form of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d.  Yet scepticism has come from many corners \u2013 not all are convinced the WHS has the right priorities, or that it will have the weight to deliver them. MSF\u2019s decision to pull out of the summit is the latest example of this disillusion. So what can we hope to achieve in Istanbul? What responsibilities should be focused on, and which ones have been kept off the table? Is there still scope for meaningful change and binding commitments?  Before the WHS starts on 23 May, join us and an expert panel on Thursday 19 May 1-3pm to discuss these questions and many more.
