  "body": "Bill Clinton returned to Appalachia this week with a familiar song ringing in his ears. Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow) was a campaign anthem that helped the \u201cBig Dog\u201d win two presidential elections in the 1990s in this mountain region. It played him off stage again in Kentucky on Thursday afternoon and by the time he arrived in the state\u2019s hard-pressed eastern coalfields that evening, it was to serve as the theme of a speech designed to rally his wife\u2019s campaign in 2016. \u201cThe problem is that people think every tomorrow is going to be just like yesterday,\u201d he told a group of miners in Prestonburg. \u201cThe question is, are we going to get back in the future business, and are you going along for the ride?\u201d The miners had booed when he walked on stage. These days the mountains appear instead to belong to a politician offering something more potent than hope. Even among Republicans, Donald Trump divides opinion in many parts of the country. Not so in Appalachia, where his success in the party\u2019s recently completed primary elections here was universal enough that it could serve as a new definition of the region\u2019s rugged borders. Of the 420 counties seen as sharing a culture that transcends state lines, Trump won all but 16 , including a sweep of western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and the western uplands of Virginia with potentially profound ramifications for the general election.   appalachia map   These three states are regarded as \u201cpurple\u201d battlegrounds in part because they remain diverse, with blue Democratic cities that tend to balance out a red shift in the hills. But Hillary Clinton may not be able to count on their support in the same way Barack Obama and her husband did. Despite retaining a clear opinion poll lead over Trump at the national level, the Clinton campaign was jolted this week by a new survey suggesting three purple states \u2013 Ohio, Pennsylvania and Trump\u2019s second home state of Florida \u2013 may now be too close to call. The Quinnipaic poll put Trump four points ahead in Ohio and only one point behind in Pennsylvania and Florida. It may prove an outlier, but no presidential candidate since 1960 has won the White House without taking at least two of these three battlegrounds. To add insult to injury, the same survey showed Clinton\u2019s otherwise struggling Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders doing better against Trump in each of the battleground states \u2013 adding to momentum he gained this week with his victory in the West Virginia primary, something he will hope to replicate in Kentucky on Tuesday. To understand why some traditional Democratic bulwarks now look vulnerable for Clinton, the Guardian travelled along this wide arc of Appalachian counties that make up the core of Trump\u2019s support among white working-class men and have become a symptom of her struggle to despatch Sanders.    I think Trump is nuts, but I\u2019d love to have him as a president to see what happens    The Ohio city of Steubenville lies 300 miles north of Prestonburg, but shares the same hilly topography and deep scepticism of the Clinton school of optimism. While Bill was president, this once proud industrial community experienced the sharpest drop in population of any urban area in the country. It has continued to shrink since, as the collapse of the local steel industry leaves an economic vacuum that remains to be filled. As in other steel towns in nearby Pennsylvania, here previously loyal Democrats are now flirting with Trump\u2019s unique brand of Republicanism in growing numbers. \u201cI think Trump is nuts, but I\u2019d love to have him as a president to see what happens,\u201d says Edward Tucker, a 68-year-old retired carpenter from Steubenville, who says he has no regrets about twice voting for Barack Obama in previous elections.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to end up in some kind of war or anything,\u201d he adds hastily. \u201cBut something is going to change if he\u2019s president; we just don\u2019t know what.\u201d       Nevertheless Tucker is sceptical of any politician claiming to be able to return all the jobs to the area and does not simply blame China for taking away the steel mills. \u201cThere is nothing the president can do,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem with jobs is our advancement in technology and they are not going to reverse that. They are going to keep trying to make things easier and better. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201d It is realism echoed by the local director of economic development, Evan Scurti, who doubts high-volume steel mills will ever return to the area and is focused on trying to attract smaller companies back instead. With a pause even in the local natural gas boom and lack of flat development land, it is a tall order. \u201cThere are a lot more Trump posters going up around here,\u201d he notes. But other parts of Ohio have shown that manufacturing jobs can return, if enough effort is made. Sara Marrs-Maxfield coordinates economic development for Athens County, which has just tempted back a tyre mold manufacturer which decided to close up six years ago in the face of cheap foreign competition. Persuading Athens Tire & Mold to reopen its abandoned factory was not easy and required sizeable grants and assistance from local development bodies. Yet it will bring 60 jobs back to a site that would otherwise have been converted into student housing instead. \u201cIt comes down to a matter of political will,\u201d says Marrs-Maxfield.       Among Trump supporters, there is more going on than a simple belief that he will work harder to encourage such \u201creshoring\u201d of US manufacturing. Standing outside a Lowes DIY store in Steubenville, Edward Tucker acknowledges a personal distrust of Hillary Clinton too, although he denies any suggestion of sexism.  \u201cI like Trump, and Sanders. I don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton at all. I never did like her. It has nothing to do with her politics, I just never liked her. I don\u2019t like her attitude,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not because she\u2019s a woman; I think she\u2019s arrogant. I don\u2019t know, she might be just fine, but she comes across as arrogant.\u201d Back in Prestonburg, some of the Trump supporters who have picketed the Bill Clinton event also acknowledge a personal antipathy that is peculiarly focused on the former secretary of state. \u201cIt think it was a smart move to send him instead of her. Bill is more likely to go down well with Democrats here in eastern Kentucky,\u201d says Terry Adam, a 49-year-old small businessman from Letcher County, shortly before he is moved on by a secret service agent. There are plenty of men in the line of Democratic supporters at the event too though. \u201cMy daughter here looks up to Hillary,\u201d says Jeff Krejsa, a 40-year-old defence engineer who has travelled from Richmond, Kentucky, with his daughters, aged seven and 10. \u201cI like the fact that she is at a young age and is seeing a woman run for president.\u201d Inside the event, there is also palpable excitement at the prospect of the first female president that transcends any easy stereotyping of Appalachian menfolk. But the issue that Bill Clinton grapples hardest with is what to do about Trump\u2019s appeal to economic nostalgia in a region that may never recapture the job security it once had.  \u201cI think [the Trump slogan] \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 is actually \u2018Make it like it was in the 1960s\u2019,\u201d says Clinton. \u201cIf you think you can do it, have at it. If you really believe you can go back to the 1950s and make it like it was then, have at it.\u201d It is not that the Democrats don\u2019t believe in progress, simply that they are more realistic about how it will be achieved, claims Bill. \u201cI grew up in a place like this. I hope to be the last American president to grow up without an indoor toilet,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody believed they could make tomorrow better than today \u2026 but we are not going to get anywhere screaming at each other.\u201d The trouble is that tomorrow did arrive in many parts of the US, and not everyone liked what it looked like. For now, the voices shouting loudest about it \u2013 not just in rural Appalachia, but in cities across the US where the middle class is shrinking \u2013 are perhaps the ones more voters want to hear.",
