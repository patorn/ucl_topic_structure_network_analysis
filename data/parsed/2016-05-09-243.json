  "body": "Today\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook This edition of Talking Horses comes to you from Clonmel, where a group of pressman are based en route to Ballydoyle, there to gawk at contenders for the Epsom Classics. We warmed up last night with dinner in the famous McCarthy\u2019s Bar in Fethard, which is rich in two things besides food and drink: pictures of star local horses winning major races, which line every wall, and ghost stories.   Related: Horse racing tips: Monday 9 May    Perhaps spooky tales are to be expected, considering the pub also doubles as an undertaker\u2019s office. \u201cWe keep the bodies in the basement,\u201d said the landlord. \u201cHa-ha, I\u2019m joking!\u201d But he held my gaze as if to add: \u201cOr am I?\u201d If such things don\u2019t put you off, I recommend McCarthy\u2019s, which also boasts an impressive list of celebrity visitors. Paul Carberry once rode in here on a horse, I\u2019m told. It certainly sounds like the kind of thing he would do. Sobriety will doubtless prevail at Musselburgh, where Just Paul (3.10), a triple course winner, is of interest at 6-1. It\u2019s a couple of years since he won and he had a fruitless first year with Micky Hammond but there was renewed promise on his reppearance until he ran out of room at Beverley. His current mark is a stone below the last one from which he won and this race is a great opportunity for him if Hammond really has got him back. Later on the card, Quick N Quirky (5.10) appeals at 7-1. Tim Easterby\u2019s filly was never nearer than at the finish when fifth of 17 on her reappearance over a too-short six furlongs. She promised quite a bit on her first two runs last summer and may now be able to deliver. Tipping competition \u2013 a new week Congratulations to Bacciodilupo, who won last week\u2019s competition on a final score of +32.50. He was already in fourth before finding Taurean Star (25-1) on Friday. This week\u2019s prize is a copy of Addicted to Horse Racing by Norton Howells, a late convert to the greatest game, who tells us his tales of trying to crack the code of gambling success. \u201cThe writing is precise yet evocative, with nothing held back, as we discover the vivid consequences of an obsession,\u201d the press release tells me. If you don\u2019t win, you can buy a copy here. To kick things off, we\u2019d like your selections, please, for these races: 4.10 Musselburgh, 4.20 Brighton, 5.10 Musselburgh. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.
