  "body": "Barbara Hannigan sings the songs of Erik Satie as if she\u2019s sitting next to you, whispering and cooing across the kitchen table with sufficient breathiness, soft edges and exquisite spaciousness to match Reinbert de Leeuw\u2019s sweet-melancholy piano chords. They open with Trois M\u00e9lodies (1886) \u2013 languorous, tender little love songs that Satie wrote when he was 20. The pace picks up, but the space and sweetness remain in Trois Autres M\u00e9lodies and the majestically placid Hymne. Then there\u2019s Socrate, the bizarre cantata that stands out in Satie\u2019s oeuvre as a work of comprehensive seriousness. Or does it? In 1916, the Princesse de Polignac commissioned a melodrama based on Plato\u2019s Dialogues and the composer obliged with this baffling setting of a fuddy-duddy translation by Victor Cousin. It was either an extreme manifestation of dadaist anti-sentimentality or Satie\u2019s ultra-dry humour gone rogue; either way, Hannigan makes intimate confessionals of the plain text and archly non-eventful melodies, and clinches the art of enigmatic understatement.",
