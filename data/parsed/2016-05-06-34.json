  "body": "In London, the religion of the Labour candidate for the city\u2019s mayor became an issue only when his Conservative opponent made it one, by attempting to link his rival to Islamist extremism in a campaign criticised as divisive and racist.  Abroad, however, it seems the faith and family background of Sadiq Khan is seen through a somewhat different prism: in much foreign media coverage of the elections, it was more important than his politics. \u201cSadiq Khan likely to become the first Muslim mayor of London,\u201d was the headline in France\u2019s leading left leaning news weekly L\u2019Obs. The country\u2019s largest commercial broadcaster, TF1, went for: \u201cSadiq Khan: Muslim, immigrant\u2019s son, self-made man \u2013 and future mayor\u201d? The Metronews freesheet went further, saying a Khan victory would make the Tooting MP \u201cthe first Muslim mayor of a European capital\u201d.     The Metronews freesheet\u2019s report on Sadiq Khan. Photograph: Metronews    Le Monde went out of its way to note that Khan, \u201cthe son of an immigrant bus driver from Pakistan\u201d, described his moderate Islamic faith as \u201cpart of my identity\u201d \u2013 adding that his opponent Zac Goldsmith was \u201cthe son of a Franco-British billionaire of Jewish origin\u201d.   Related: Zac Goldsmith attacked by senior Tory over London mayoral election tactics    Khan\u2019s religion was prominent in media coverage of the election in the Netherlands, where Ahmed Aboutaleb has been the Muslim mayor of the country\u2019s second largest city, Rotterdam, since 2009. The headline of the authoritative NRC Handsblad was: \u201cThe green millionaire v the leftwing Muslim\u201d, while the right leaning De Telegraaf chose simply: \u201cLondon could get its first Muslim mayor\u201d.  In Germany, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung remarked \u2013 although not in its headline \u2013 that London seemed on course for its first Muslim mayor, while Switzerland\u2019s Le Temps noted that the duel between the sons of \u201ca billionaire, and a bus driver\u201d could see the city becoming \u201cthe first European capital to be run by a Muslim\u201d.     S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s report. Photograph: S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung    Different perceptions of Islam and integration were compounded in some countries by a wildly different continental view of Pakistan. \u201cIs Khan\u2019s Pakistani origin not an obstacle?\u201d asked a journalist on the Swiss radio station RTS. \u201cIs Pakistan not associated with fundamentalism and terror?\u201d           Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor - video profile    The station\u2019s interviewee replied that in a city in which almost 40% of residents were born outside the UK, and whose Muslim population makes up 12% of the total (and more than 30% in some boroughs), the popular image of Pakistan was more usually to do with corner shops and academic excellence. But perhaps the most striking example of how differently much of the world sees London \u2013 and the importance of religion \u2013 from the way the city plainly sees itself came from the US, where Donald Trump caused uproar with a call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. \u201cDEVELOPING: FIRST MUSLIM MAYOR OF LONDONISTAN\u201d was the top headline on the popular news aggregator site The Drudge Report, followed closely by: \u201cJewish leaders express concern over voting problems\u201d and \u201cFLASHBACK: Parts of city 50% Islamic\u201d.",
