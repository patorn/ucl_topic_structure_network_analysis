But this doesn\u2019t really apply to taught science subjects at the university level, at least in my experience over a few decades in university settings around the world. If anything, it\u2019s the opposite: stressed-out scientists, who do very well by the all-powerful yardstick of research excellence, have to be dragged from their labs to the podium to transmit their wisdom to the younger generation. As you might expect from a random sample of the population, the majority of whom have no actual pedagogical training, some are better at this task than others. This week, something very interesting has happened in UK undergraduate education policy. On Monday, the Government set out a long-awaited white paper on higher education reform. Within a many-faceted treatise on new approaches across the spectrum of the landscape, I was struck most by the measures set out to ensure that students get their money\u2019s worth. Simply put, the amount a university can charge students will soon be linked to an independent assessment of its teaching performance via a Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF).  I should declare at this point that, being born and raised in the American system, I have nothing against paying for a quality undergraduate experience \u2013 indeed, by comparison, \u00a39k a year is a snip. I did detect within, however, an initial knee-jerk aversion to the thought of introducing an even more aggressive free-market element into higher education \u2013 an aversion which has been echoed elsewhere.    Related: The Guardian view on the higher education white paper: the customer is always ripe \u2013 for fleecing | Editorial    Having thought through the paper\u2019s implications, however, I find that I don\u2019t ultimately bridle at the idea of linking excellence in teaching to financial reward. Institutions, especially those with a long tradition, can get fusty. Some fustiness is probably good for students: the venerable tutorial system of Oxford, for example, where one or two students sit with a tutor each week and go over essays in detail, probably can\u2019t be bettered. On the other hand, there are likely universities offering modules to many hundreds of students where the temptation by time-poor researchers not to update lectures or go the extra mile is strong. Is incentivising universities to, as the white paper says, \u201craise their game\u2019, really that bad? I think the case is especially strong in the sciences. As the white paper puts it, \u201cFor too long, teaching has been the poor cousin of research. Skewed incentives have led to a progressive decline in the relative status of teaching as an activity.\u201d This is a gross understatement. In many institutions, the only metric that matters for promotion is the bottom line: how many millions of pounds of grant money you pull in per year. This metric will be linked with the number of publications, as the more papers you have, the more likely it will be that you\u2019ll get funding (and the more funding you have, the more likely it is you\u2019ll be able to do the research that ends up with the papers). So you cannot really blame researchers for prioritising research over teaching, if research is the only thing that is properly rewarded. I have a personal interest in this disparity, as for the past few years my funding has been contingent on teaching. I am not officially a lecturer, but I probably rack up more student contact hours than most lecturers \u2013 when a module is in full swing, it is not uncommon for me to spend 5 full days a week dealing with teaching.  I am passionate about this responsibility, and I think I do a decent job at it. Despite this, I am classed as a researcher, and the only way I can get promoted, realistically, is by showing that my research \u2018output\u2019 is robust. But how is that possible when there is so little time available for it? Only time will tell how my heavy teaching load will adversely affect my university career.   Related: Academic anxiety dreams, and what they might mean | Jenny Rohn    But maybe this is all about to change. The TEF will no doubt set into motion a costly, cumbersome bureaucratic framework akin to the processes erected for the analogous Research Excellence Framework. I have no doubt that it may very well be soul-destroying for those involved.  On the other hand, there is some glimmer of hope: could it be that this very exercise will be the light that shines on people like me \u2013 researchers who invest a lot of time, energy, heart and soul in teaching \u2013 and properly incentivises these activities?  At the end of the day, I work in a university: should I not be recognised and rewarded for the teaching that I do? And if so, isn\u2019t that a positive step, not only for me, but also for the students who are paying so much for the privilege?",
