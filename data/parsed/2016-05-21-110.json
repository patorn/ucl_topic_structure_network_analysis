  "body": "When I recently learned that intestines have feelings, too, I began wondering what their days must be like, and listening more carefully to their cries. Sometimes they are quite obvious \u2013 a bloat that says, \u201cplease don\u2019t eat oatmeal\u201d or a clench that says \u201cthat\u2019s not a good idea\u201d. Then I felt like drinking a Diet Coke. I drink a fair amount it, at least one 20-ounce (600ml) bottle a day, if not two. But then a thought infiltrated into my brain from its snaky neighbor to the south.   Related: America is drowning in surplus cheese. What should we do with it all? | Dave Schilling    \u201cQuit it with the Diet Coke,\u201d it said. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d I did know. I\u2019ve contemplated quitting Diet Coke before, but I\u2019ve come up with all manner of excuses every time. It\u2019s my only vice, I whine. It\u2019s too hard. I can\u2019t deal with that right now.  But I thought about all the reasons why I would like to quit Diet Coke. I don\u2019t want empty cans and bottles around me that I have to deal with \u2013 it makes me feel like a wino. It must be killing my teeth. Some say Diet Coke causes all kinds of brain problems and joint issues and maybe even cancer. Then I asked myself, \u201cwhat are the benefits of this regimen of consuming regular amounts of expensive, tainted water?\u201d Little breaks \u2013 it becomes associated with a sense of relief. A banal identity marker. \u201cYou\u2019re a Diet Coker? Me too!\u201d Companionship \u2013 that little joy you feel because Diet Coke is always there for you.  Why doesn\u2019t eating baby carrots or having a plain glass of water trigger the same sensations? I also drink a lot of tea, and that doesn\u2019t do it either. I think it\u2019s because Diet Coke has a dark side. Despite the beverage\u2019s marketed image of \u201cfun\u201d and sexy, Diet Coke really isn\u2019t.     Others will admit sadly that they, too, have tried to leave, but Diet Coke won\u2019t let them.    It doesn\u2019t actually taste good. It can make you burp. Is it cute to be drinking sodas all day long? Not really. It\u2019s that little crackle of \u201cI like sabotaging myself with bad decisions\u201d that keeps \u2019em coming back. \u201cMaybe this time it will taste good. Maybe it actually will be refreshing.\u201d Diet Coke promises a lot, but delivers little. A diet drink is supposed to be a guilt-free sweet treat. No calories \u2013 all joy! But Diet Coke can make its drinkers feel guilty, knowing that maybe something isn\u2019t quite right in their body as it slides down into their depths. It is in that curious category of \u201cnon-food items\u201d \u2013 at best, tooth-rotting and fattening; at worst? Who knows? Coke took something decent (water), mucked it up, called it \u201cthe real thing\u201d and exported it all over the globe. I have a friend who calls Coke the \u201cblack water of imperialism\u201d. Why are we all so thirsty, anyway? People used to have two cups of coffee and a scotch as their daily hydration. They were fine. I sometimes think that we\u2019ve turned into big babies (myself included) who need our ba-ba\u2019s, as we lug around bottles of water and diet sodas.  Nonetheless, something had to replace my beloved Diet Cokes. I couldn\u2019t just ditch my ba-ba cold turkey. So I cranked up my seltzer machine and laid in some Key limes. I am not lying when I say that this watery treat is about a million times better than Diet Coke. I\u2019m going to save a lot of money, anyway. Diet Coke retails for about 2.5 cents per ounce. My tap water costs about 2 cents per gallon.   Related: No amount of 'free from' labelling will make processed food good for you | Marion Nestle    How terrific do I feel since quitting? Physically, about the same. Mentally, I feel more peaceful without that nagging feeling of \u201cmaybe I should stop and get a Diet Coke\u201d. I don\u2019t have the insane sugar cravings I thought were part of my personality \u2013 just the regular ones. I am walking taller since I have taken back a piece of something I didn\u2019t realize I had lost: my self-respect. Sure, a lot of Diet Cokers will roll their eyes at suggestions that it\u2019s an unhealthy beverage. Some will make uncomfortable jokes. Others will admit sadly that they, too, have tried to leave, but Diet Coke won\u2019t let them. But they aren\u2019t really talking about Diet Coke. The craving is real, yes. But it\u2019s bigger than that \u2013 continuing to do things that you don\u2019t want to do, but you feel you must do, but you don\u2019t really have to do, is a real sparkle-killer.  And, also, Diet Coke is awful.",
