  "body": "Give yourself wholeheartedly to this improbable new musical and, come curtain call, you could find yourself emotionally satisfied, morally uplifted and, quite possibly, wiping tears from your cheeks. It\u2019s rather like experiencing The Wizard of Oz, Pollyanna and Powell and Pressburger\u2019s war-themed films, all rolled into one \u2013 triumph over adversity, hard work rewarded, generosity repaid, the transformational power of art and self-belief, affirmation that loving relationships are the stuff of happiness. Richard Taylor and Rachel Wagstaff\u2019s adaptation reshapes Paul Gallico\u2019s 1958 novel Mrs \u2019Arris Goes to Paris, about a London charlady, Ada Harris, whose postwar, make-do-and-mend, ration-restricted understanding of the world is transformed by the sight of a client\u2019s Christian Dior dress. \u201cIt\u2019s a work of art... something not real, made to make you feel,\u201d she declares, sinking to her knees in almost religious ecstasy (the gorgeousness of the \u201ciridescent organza\u201d gown slyly suggested by the shimmering cone of a spotlight). \u201cI have to have one!\u201d This is a dangerous key moment \u2013 a silk thread\u2019s width from bathetic ridiculousness. Writing and setting, seamlessly crafted under director Daniel Evans, make it convincing. Clare Burt\u2019s Ada, a beautifully balanced intertwining of ordinary and extraordinary, achieves transcendence without schmaltz.         The trailer for Flowers for Mrs Harris.    Taylor\u2019s music and lyrics are woven so closely with Wagstaff\u2019s words that speech and song seem two tones of colour in one fabric \u2013 grey reality shot through with dazzling dreams. No big numbers but plenty of emotional heft, under Tom Brady\u2019s musical direction. Lez Brotherston\u2019s minimal set makes maximum impact \u2013 skyline cutouts silhouette Battersea power station, the Eiffel Tower; Ada\u2019s home a huddled-together dresser and table, kettle boiling on a tiny stove; Dior\u2019s salon, a sweeping staircase in an immensity of space. Lighting by Mark Henderson brings the air to sparkling, multi-textured life. The writers niftily twin Ada\u2019s London clients with obverse characters in the world of Paris couture (although overall the construction would benefit from a few nips and tucks). Roles are doubled so effectively that the cast seems twice its actual size. Unfair, as ever, to single out a few: Anna-Jane Casey (fellow char and fractious best friend); Laura Pitt-Pulford (wannabe actress/ top model); Rebecca Caine (English lady/ put-upon couturier); Louis Maskell (longing lover on both sides of the Channel). Not at all unfair, however, to say that the glittering centrepiece around which the whole production revolves is Ada. Burt\u2019s multi-stranded interpretation of the role is to acting as Dior is to haute couture: impeccable. This is Daniel Evans\u2019s final production for Sheffield after seven years as artistic director. Chichester \u2013 his next big dream \u2013 is lucky to have him. \u2022 Flowers for Mrs Harris is at the Crucible, Sheffield until 4 June",
