  "body": "Until the age of 15 Neal Hatley had never played rugby. It might have stayed that way had he not attended a school in South Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape where football was frowned upon and hot showers were only allocated in the evenings to members of the top three rugby sides. Those failing to make the cut had to shiver beneath cold jets of water instead.

The comfortably-upholstered Hatley was soon sticking up his hand to play in the front row, thinking only of the delicious warmth that could flow his way as a result. Had the boiler at Dale College in King William\u2019s Town been more efficient, English rugby might never have encountered its new, highly-rated scrum coach. Hatley\u2019s appointment by Eddie Jones \u2013 who has also now added the former Wallaby Glen Ella to his coaching team for next month\u2019s Australia tour \u2013 could prove a similarly happy case of serendipity. Jones wants to make England\u2019s scrum simultaneously a weapon and a launchpad, both of which come naturally to his southern African-reared lieutenant. It is a handy bonus, too, that the Lancashire-born Hatley captained England Saxons and played alongside England\u2019s current defence coach, Paul Gustard, at London Irish. No wonder the 46-year-old had cause in midweek to reflect on life\u2019s unpredictable twists before his final game as a Bath employee on Saturday. He certainly owes a thank you to his father Alan, whose decision to swap life in Bolton for Rhodesia in the 1970s opened a door to a different world. Hatley junior was born in Chorley \u2013 \u201cYou probably can\u2019t tell from the accent\u201d \u2013 but spent his formative years in and around Bulawayo. \u201cMy dad was a quantity surveyor. He\u2019d lived in Bolton his whole life and wanted to do something different. We ended up in what is now Zimbabwe and when I was about 15 we moved to East London in South Africa. I\u2019d only ever played football \u2013 my father was a massive Bolton Wanderers fan \u2013 and a little bit of rugby league. When I turned up to school and asked what time football was, everyone shook their heads. I played full-back and No8 initially until I realised I wasn\u2019t going to make the school third team in those positions. Hot showers were the priority so I got pushed up to prop and stayed there.\u201d Fate, or plain chance, has been a recurring feature of Hatley\u2019s career ever since. After moving to Durban he met the former Springboks coach Ian McIntosh, who moulded him into a player good enough to represent Natal and Western Province. Stuck behind a battalion of Springboks props, however, a chance meeting with a holidaying Joel Stransky, the World Cup-winning fly-half and former team-mate, changed everything. \u201cHe found out I had a UK passport, gave my name to somebody and I got flown over to speak to Bath, Bedford and Richmond.\u201d He chose Bedford, only to be caught in the legal battle between the club\u2019s then owner Frank Warren and rival American boxing promoter Don King. \u201cWhen Don King started fighting with him about Prince Naseem there were all sorts of shenanigans. We even had to wave pay cheques for the press that turned out to be empty. They were interesting times.\u201d His meandering odyssey still had one more significant step left in it. After a mere six games of the 1998-99 Premiership season, he was abruptly signed by London Irish following an injury to their Welsh international Peter Rogers. Had that emergency not occurred he might never have connected with Gustard, although Jones has always been quick to spot hard-workers capable of lightening the mood. The avuncular Hatley has duly been hired to coach England\u2019s scrum for two days per week and improve the performance pathway for forwards from Under-18 level up to the senior side.

He can socialise with them and at the same time tell them they\u2019re not being selected. I\u2019ve never seen anything like the amount of detail he puts on scrums but he\u2019s also worked on our contact area and defence. He\u2019s quite an asset to lose.\u201d When you factor in the youthful promise in England\u2019s squad, Steve Borthwick\u2019s technical expertise and Gustard\u2019s relentless enthusiasm, it is little wonder Hatley sounds excited, having turned down two tempting job offers in South Africa last year. \u201cFor me there couldn\u2019t be a more exciting time to be involved with English rugby. I think there\u2019s real depth in key positions and that, for me, makes it a really exciting time. They\u2019re so much better for what happened in the World Cup.\u201d The potential downsides, of course, are the extra scrutiny of the Test arena and Jones\u2019s legendary work ethic. Hatley does not seem remotely fazed by either prospect. \u201cIf coaching at that level was easy everyone would be doing it. I expect to be pushed and pulled all over to get the best from the players. I\u2019m under no illusion as to how tough that\u2019s going to be.\u201d Having grown up an England fan in a distant land \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve only ever supported England \u2026 we\u2019re an unbelievably patriotic family\u201d \u2013 he is keen to get started but leaving Bath on an upbeat note also matters hugely. While the players have already made a joke of it \u2013 \u201cWhen it was announced they brought in some of those party poppers and celebratory hats\u201d \u2013 there will inevitably be sadness after the game against Leicester at the Rec. \u201cIt will be an emotional day but we\u2019ve got people like Stuart Hooper who have served the club longer. Rob Webber, Dominic Day and Horacio Agulla are also leaving. For me it\u2019s about getting a result to send those guys off well.\u201d Hatley also deserves a raised glass but, luckily for English rugby, he is not going far.",
