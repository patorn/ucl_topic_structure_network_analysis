  "body": "Amir Khan suffered a knockout every bit as brutal as the first one of his career here on Saturday night when Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez threaded a chilling right hand on to his briefly exposed jaw in the sixth round to leave the Briton senseless on the canvas for a couple of worrying minutes. \u201cI\u2019m all right, I\u2019m all right,\u201d Khan told his concerned corner after rising \u2013 but the tears flowed as he lent his head on the shoulder of his trainer, Virgil Hunter, knowing a split-second lapse in concentration had undone all his good early work, as he \u201cdared to be great\u201d by going up two weights to challenge the Mexican for his world middleweight title. They shared anxieties, but differing forms: Khan\u2019s in concern for his chin, Canelo perhaps worried he would run out of time if he fell too far behind. As it happened, the Mexican timed his fight to perfection.

Nobody could \u2013 and no sensible pundit would \u2013 accuse Khan of not reaching high. He was attempting the biggest upset by a British boxer fighting abroad since John H Stracey beat the great Jose Napoles in Mexico City in 1975; Lloyd Honeyghan\u2019s inspired victory in six rounds over a weight-drained but still estimable Don Curry in Atlantic City 30 years ago is in that mix; before that, we have to dip into ancient history. This was some wall to climb, too tall as it happened.     Amir Khan contemplates defeat. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters    And speaking of walls, every Las Vegas cleaner, janitor, construction worker and cab driver with roots south of the border were pulling for their cinnamon-topped hero, and would mightily have loved it had their b\u00eate noir, Donald Trump, been dumb enough to accept an invitation to sit somewhere in the cheaper seats.

And there weren\u2019t many neutrals among the 16,540 squeezed into the new arena. The mood of high drama and respectful conflict could not have been more intense. This, though, was Canelo\u2019s town for the weekend, Cinco de Mayo, co-opted since the days of Julio Cesar Chavez we were told, even if, contrary to the salesmanship of the event\u2019s golden-tongued promoter, Oscar De La Hoya, only a handful of his fights in this city coincided with Mexico\u2019s most cherished national holiday. Still, this is boxing; on a night when the great Panamanian Roberto Dur\u00e1n was introduced at ringside as Mexican, we were reminded that myth and hokum are perennial ingredients of the pie. There was nothing counterfeit about the fight, however. It was as honest as a desert sunset. The most common larceny in this town and this business is of the spirit and the pocket, but nobody could complain they were shortchanged while it lasted. From round one, Khan\u2019s reflexes and concentration were on fire. If those faculties let him down in previous disasters \u2013 against Breidis Prescott eight years and in 2012 against Garcia \u2013 here he was, \u201cen fuego\u201d, as they say. Khan stole the first round with stealth and that snaking jab, as expected, sniping from distance and circling his prey. Khan said beforehand he expected to be hit and hurt, but he was doing his damnedest to make a liar of himself as he made the early running \u2013 literally \u2013 and a rare left hook rattled his teeth without obvious discomfort. Canelo found his range a couple of times in the third, but Khan continued to shift left, right and every which way to stay out of trouble, picking on the move like a bird in the park. \u201cCanelo never backs down\u201d said the message on the T-shirts of his compadres, but Khan was taking that out of the equation by not asking him to, as he continued to box at range, scoring with intermittent flurries. It was nearly 12 minutes before they clinched, so clean was the action. There was a case for giving the champion the fifth, as he landed a couple of solid head shots, but Khan remained cool under fire. And there was some way to go. Could Khan contain his natural thirst for a fight and hold his concentration? As they got to half way, Canelo, more relaxed, began to let his hands go and, for the first time, looked the more dominant fighter. And that is when the crunching conclusion arrived \u2013 a long right hand from out of the blue that landed with such precision the British challenger was unconscious before he hit the canvas. Boxing always craves fresh talent and on the undercard the virtuoso boxing of the promoter\u2019s baby-faced cousin, Diego De La Hoya, caught the eye of knowledgeable fans who turned up before the pay-per-view broadcast began. The smooth-moving super-bantamweight toyed with the unbeaten and game Californian, Rocco Santomauro, in nearly every exchange before an audacious uppercut on-the-walk in the seventh coincided with the merciful intervention of his opponent\u2019s trainer, Shane Mosley. We will be hearing a lot of 21-year-old De La Hoya, who has stopped nine of his 15 opponents, and embarrassed all of them. All in all, not a bad night for Mexico.",
