  "body": "Michael Carrick has been offered a year extension to his Manchester United contract by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, with the veteran midfielder considering whether to extend his stay at Old Trafford into a second decade. Carrick, who moved to United in 2006 from Tottenham for an initial \u00a314m, is out of contract at the end of June and had been linked with a move away from Old Trafford. However, Mourinho\u2019s arrival to replace Louis van Gaal earlier this month has led to the 34-year-old being given assurances that he does figure in the new manager\u2019s plans for next season and Carrick is now mulling over whether to stay.

He\u2019s a good fit for the club and hopefully he\u2019ll do very well,\u201d he said earlier this week. \u201cI have to say it\u2019s sad to see anyone lose their job, the manager and staff, but good times are ahead.\u201d Mourinho spent Bank Holiday Monday meeting staff at United\u2019s Carrington training base having travelled up from London. He was greeted by the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, and given a tour of his new workplace, including meeting Sir Bobby Charlton. Having initially opposed the appointment of the former Chelsea manager, Charlton was shown on MUTV sharing a joke with Mourinho, who referenced England\u2019s victory over Portugal in the 1966 World Cup semi-final.

The Portuguese\u2019s wife Matilde later tweeted as picture of her husband outside Carrington clasping a United bag. Mourinho is scheduled to start work with those United players not involved in Euro 2016 or the Copa Am\u00e9rica when they report back for pre-season training on 4 July.",
