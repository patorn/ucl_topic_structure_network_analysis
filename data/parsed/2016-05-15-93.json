Related: The Nice Guys review: Crowe and Gosling are abysmal PIs in a high hit-rate action comedy    The actor was promoting his new action comedy The Nice Guys with co-star Ryan Gosling which is premiering out of competition at the Cannes film festival. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to drama school,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been acting since I was six years old and over time you get more and more efficient at getting to the centre of the character. I don\u2019t even know what the Stanislavski method may be. I have no fucking idea and I don\u2019t care to know. Seriously, it\u2019s not that complicated. If you want to be an actor, work it out for yourself. I actually like the old Olivier quote: \u2018learn your dialogue and don\u2019t bump into the furniture.\u2019\u201d Crowe and Gosling star as an unlikely duo who team up to investigate a conspiracy in 1970s Los Angeles. The pair were in high spirits throughout the press conference, possibly linked to the enthusiastic reviews the film has been getting. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called it \u201chorribly enjoyable\u201d while Variety\u2019s Owen Gleiberman praised it as \u201csmashingly disreputable\u201d.

Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPA    \u201cRussell did all his work from New Zealand,\u201d Gosling joked. \u201cThe chemistry was added in post-production.\u201d When a reporter from Vanity Fair Italy asked if they were \u201cbad men\u201d, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m Batman, he\u2019s Robin\u201d, while a Colombian journalist was told by Crowe that she shouldn\u2019t be on radio because she\u2019s got \u201ca beautiful face\u201d. It\u2019s the latest film from Shane Black, who was last in Cannes to premiere his directorial debut Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which matched Val Kilmer with Robert Downey Jr. He\u2019s also been behind buddy action comedies Lethal Weapon and The Long Kiss Goodnight. He said he was proud of his latest pairing. \u201cYou have two physical comedians,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best kind of comedy for me is not one that takes its cue from being pretentious. It\u2019s one that is more like a juggler on the street corner who\u2019s constantly aware that they\u2019re going to throw tomatoes unless you keep it lively. Ryan in particular was particularly willing to fling himself off of stuff onto other stuff and sometimes there was glass in the middle\u201d.",
