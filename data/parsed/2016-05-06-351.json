  "body": "Becoming the presumptive Republican nominee has not changed Donald Trump at all. In a rally in Charleston, West Virginia, in front of roughly 13,000 screaming attendees, the newly minted presumptive Republican nominee took a victory lap. Trump proclaimed \u201cI wish the primaries would keep going but I am the only one left\u201d and celebrated by repeatedly urging his supporters to not even bother voting in West Virginia\u2019s upcoming primary and instead \u201csave your vote for the general election in November\u201d. Two days after Ted Cruz suspended his campaign, effectively ending the Republican primary, Trump was in high spirits as he briefly wore a hard hat on stage and mimed the work of a coalminer. In a state where coalmining is still an important industry, Trump repeatedly emphasized his commitment to the industry. He told the crowd, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a little secret. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the mines,\u201d speaking in front of a backdrop of uniformed coalminers holding signs that read \u201cTrump digs coal\u201d. In lieu of his typical attacks on primary opponents \u2013 calling Cruz \u201clyin\u2019 Ted\u201d and criticizing the way John Kasich eats food \u2013 Trump pivoted his vitriol toward Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. He made veiled reference to former president Bill Clinton\u2019s liaison with Monica Lewinsky in the White House and said of the Clinton Foundation, \u201cthe whole thing is a scam\u201d. Trump made no mention of the criticism that he is receiving from inside his own party. Just hours before he took the stage, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, told CNN that he was not ready to endorse the real estate mogul\u2019s candidacy. \u201cI\u2019m just not ready to do that at this point\u201d said the 2012 vice-presidential nominee. In response, Trump blasted out a statement. \u201cI am not ready to support speaker Ryan\u2019s agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!\u201d  One introductory speaker, pastor Mark Burns, an African American preacher who has long been a Trump supporter, did mention Ryan\u2019s remarks. He inaccurately said that \u201cPaul Ryan said I will never endorse Donald J Trump\u201d. The packed crowd immediately burst into boos for the Republican speaker of the house.  But the skepticism of a wide variety of party leaders, including the only two living former Republican presidents, George HW Bush and George W Bush, went unmentioned at the main event. Trump did spend a significant amount of time discussing his disappointment with hairspray made without CFCs. The presumptive Republican nominee decried the fact. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to use hairspray any more because it affects the ozone. Hairspray used to be real good,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn the old days, you put the hairspray on and it\u2019s good. Today you put it on, it\u2019s good for 12 minutes.\u201d The ban on products that contain CFCs, including hairspray, is considered to be one of the most successful global environmental initiatives of all time. The crowd ate up the presumptive nominee\u2019s rhetoric and was wearing an unusual amount of Trump merchandise even by the standards of a typical campaign rally. Appalachia has long been a Trump stronghold, and the real estate mogul has won demographically similar areas to West Virginia by huge margins even when the Republican field was far more crowded.  The rally at the Charleston Civic Center, a brutalist hunk of concrete, started to fill up hours before Trump arrived and an orderly line outside dissolved into a horde of people desperate to make it into the event. Greg Bonecutter Jr, a former nurse on disability from Letart, West Virginia, was an avid Trump supporter wearing a Make America Great Again hat and a shirt that proclaimed \u201cHillary sucks but not like Monica\u201d. He was a longtime Trump supporter who backed the nominee because he was someone with whom \u201cyou knew where you stood\u201d and was sick \u201cof politicians, big money scams and cover-up lies\u201d. A registered independent, he said he thought Obama was \u201csucking Muslim tail and an apologist to terrorist actions\u201d and \u201cif it was up to me we\u2019d bring back public execution and there\u2019d be several trap doors on the White House lawn\u201d. Bonecutter warned darkly that if Clinton was elected there might be another civil war. Sandra Riddle of North Charleston shared his pessimism. She was worried about the supreme court and that if Clinton was elected \u201cwe might lose freedom of speech and assembly\u201d as well as the second amendment. She wasn\u2019t a gun owner but noted \u201cwe have to protect guns \u2026 because of people coming from Isis\u201d. Yet others simply liked Trump for his populist appeal. John Spence, a retired construction worker from Wayne County, was a former Democrat who still voted for the party at the local level but last voted for Bill Clinton at the top of the ticket. He bemoaned the end of when Democrats were more conservative and \u201cused to be called Dixiecrats\u201d, he said. Now, he continued, the party was for the \u201cpolitical machine and the more powerful\u201d and \u201cless for the common man\u201d. The party \u201chad forgotten where they came from\u201d in his opinion, and he was now steadfastly behind Trump. Trump pledged to come back to the Mountain State and praised its state song \u201cTake Me Home Country Roads\u201d by John Denver as \u201ca great song\u201d by \u201ca friend of mine and good guy\u201d. But he probably won\u2019t need to \u2013 the deep red state is as safe as any for him in a general election. The question is whether the presumptive GOP nominee can do as well with his own party\u2019s elected officials as with blue-collar former Democrats in West Virginia.",
