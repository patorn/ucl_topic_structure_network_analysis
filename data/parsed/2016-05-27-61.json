  "body": "The competition regulator is considering launching an investigation into the \u00a31.4bn takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s of Home Retail Group. The Competition and Markets Authority has set a deadline of 13 June for comments on the deal\u2019s likely effects on consumers. It will decide by 25 July whether to launch a preliminary inquiry. Home Retail, which owns Argos, backed the bid from Sainsbury\u2019s in April, ending almost five months of talks between the supermarket group and the general merchandise retailer to create Britain\u2019s biggest seller of general goods. The takeover of Argos is designed to broaden the Sainsbury\u2019s product range and reduce its reliance on the highly competitive grocery market. Sainsbury\u2019s will put Argos stores into its supermarkets, adding to its own range of homeware and other non-food goods. The deal is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year unless the CMA decides to intervene. The CMA said it will decide whether the takeover was classed as a relevant merger, which is likely because Home Retail\u2019s annual revenue is more than the \u00a370m threshold.  It will then consider \u201cwhether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services\u201d. If the CMA goes ahead with a preliminary investigation it will have 40 working days to clear the deal, seek remedies or move to a fuller inquiry that could take six months. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had expected the CMA to scrutinise the deal and that it believed the takeover would complete as planned. \u201cWe are pleased that the CMA review process into Sainsbury\u2019s proposed offer to buy Home Retail is progressing. The combination of both businesses will create a multi-product, multi-channel proposition with fast delivery networks, benefiting customers by accelerating our strategy to give them what they want, where and when they want it. We look forward to the successful completion of the deal.\u201d Last month John Walden, Home Retail\u2019s chief executive, said he hoped the deal would not raise major concerns for the CMA but it was too early to tell. The CMA last year withdrew early objections to clear Poundland\u2019s takeover of its single price rival 99p Stores. The deal was subjected to a phase 2 investigation that decided the combined retailer would have competition from other discounters. The watchdog is also investigating the \u00a3125m sale of the Sainsbury\u2019s pharmacy business to the German drugs distributor Celesio.",
