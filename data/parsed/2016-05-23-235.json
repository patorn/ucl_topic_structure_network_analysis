  "body": "It\u2019s a truism to say that most of what\u00a0we hear or read about in the papers has no effect on us, the readers. But often what we read should have some bearing on what we do, because it is not always going to be apparent to our eyes. Life may\u00a0give us an entirely wrong view of what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve been reading about Philip Green selling BHS, and the company collapsing with a huge hole in its pension fund, yet the stores keep going, at least for the moment. The vast empire of shops is being kicked about like a football, but if you hadn\u2019t read the news you\u2019d never guess from the stores themselves that there was anything untoward. I bought a pair of trousers from my local BHS last week. Earlier I\u2019d also bought from a different branch the excellently frivolous hat I wore for a\u00a0Buckingham Palace event. Whatever is happening to the group\u2019s finances, the shops are the same as before. Which is astonishing given what the staff must be going through, with their worries about the future. It makes me wonder how many other familiar organisations may be considering enormous changes to the way they operate \u2013 without any aspect of that change being obvious to us outsiders due to the heroic staff; or without the staff knowing themselves. I suppose half the time we\u2019ve no need to know what financial upheavals are underway in the back rooms, but BHS shows how ignorance is anything but bliss. I just hope the shopkeepers get through. We ought, as humane shoppers, to be concerned about the staff. We could stay away because they\u2019re having a bad time, but alas it\u2019s not clear that would actually help them if we did. What do you think? Have your say below?",
