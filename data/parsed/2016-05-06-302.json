  "body": "Axl Rose, perhaps for the first time in his career, is taking care not to cause offence. Ahead of the first of his shows filling in as frontman of AC/DC, the Guns N\u2019 Roses singer has said he means \u201cno disrespect\u201d to Brian Johnson, the man he is replacing, and that he is such a fan of Johnson\u2019s singing that he \u201cwants to do it justice\u201d. Speaking to BBC 6Music\u2019s Matt Everitt, Rose said it had been his idea to approach AC/DC after it was announced that Johnson had been advised to stop performing to protect his hearing, and that a stand-in singer would be used to complete the Rock or Bust tour.   Related: AC/DC: 'If there's a bad-parenting issue, they blame rock'n'roll'    \u201cI called the day I read about it in the news, that there was a situation going on with Brian\u2019s hearing,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI called a guy who\u2019s their production manager right now \u2026 So if I could help, and if I was able to do it, and they were interested, I\u2019d love to help. And that\u2019s how it started. I wasn\u2019t looking at it like, \u2018I\u2019m singing for AC/DC.\u2019 I was looking at it like, \u2018Y\u2019know, if I can, and if they think I\u2019m able to do it.\u201d Rose added that the set was a challenge for him. \u201cA lot of the Back in Black stuff is really challenging. I\u2019m not here in any way out of any disrespect to Brian. I can\u2019t take anything away from his singing at all,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great singer and it\u2019s really challenging to sing it. I\u2019m just trying to do it justice for the fans.\u201d AC/DC\u2019s initial statement on Johnson\u2019s departure was brusque and provoked speculation among fans about what exactly had happened. It read, in its entirety: \u201cAC/DC are forced to reschedule the 10 upcoming dates on the U. leg of their Rock or Bust World Tour. AC/DC\u2019s lead singer, Brian Johnson, has been advised by doctors to stop touring immediately or risk total hearing loss. Tomorrow\u2019s show in Atlanta through Madison Square Garden in New York, NY in early April will be made up later in the year, likely with a guest vocalist. More information regarding these rescheduled shows to come. Current ticket holders can hold on to their tickets for the rescheduled dates or receive a refund at point of purchase.\u201d   Related: AC/DC says Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose to join band for rest of tour    Though both AC/DC and Johnson have since released fuller statements, guitarist Angus Young \u2013 who also spoke to Everitt \u2013 addressed the issue again. \u201cIn his heart he wanted to finish [the tour] but because of that hearing factor he had to make the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to do, and he\u2019d had the problem since we kicked off touring. It was his call. It was a shock to us too. The last thing you want to do is walk away from something, but you don\u2019t want someone in a tragic situation; being deaf, or any other affliction.\u201d Rose is expected to still be in the throne originally made for Dave Grohl when he takes to the stage in Lisbon with AC/DC on Saturday night, having recently broken a metatarsal. The Rock or Bust tour returns to the UK for two shows, in London on 4 June and Manchester on 9 June.",
