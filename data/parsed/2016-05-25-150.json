  "body": "Tony Hall has said far-reaching powers given to parliamentary auditors to examine the BBC\u2019s finances must not undermine the corporation\u2019s editorial freedom or ability to take creative risks. The BBC director general told a public accounts committee session in Salford that while he welcomed the National Audit Office\u2019s role in \u201cmaking sure we are spending money appropriately\u201d, he wanted greater clarity over how the corporation\u2019s creative freedom would be exempted from the auditing process, and what protections would be given to commercial arm BBC Worldwide. The NAO currently carries out about two investigations a year into the BBC\u2019s finances, but under plans in the white paper published earlier this month it will no longer have to ask for permission to launch an audit.   Related: BBC chief voices fears over ministerial influence outlined in white paper    \u201cThere is broad agreement, and I can\u2019t speak for all of us but I think also from the NAO, that we need to make sure that beyond all doubt beyond all the editorial and creative independence is maintained,\u201d said Hall. \u201cHow we work out that is clear in the editorial work the NAO do with us is really important.\u201d \u201cI think the white paper rightly has a chapter on the distinctiveness of the BBC defined as taking risks, pushing boundaries, doing things that we hope will work but may not creatively work.\u201d He added that the government had considered the corporation\u2019s arguments about ensuring the audit process did not negatively affect BBC Worldwide\u2019s commercial performance and would consider them in negotiations ahead of the publication of its new royal charter.  Committee member Richard Bacon, MP for South Norfolk, said that the wording of the NAO\u2019s role as BBC auditor in the white paper seemed clear and further questioned Hall as to what issues he had with the arrangement. \u201cThe words in the white paper are absolutely fine,\u201d said Hall. \u201cI am worried about the details of how it applies when it comes to an audit. When that is worked through we need to be consistent between ourselves and the NAO what editorial judgment and independence and creative independence means.  \u201cNobody wants the BBC to feel in some ways inhibited in the editorial judgments it takes, or indeed creatively inhibited if people are worried of taking a risk on a drama or whatever that they will get some spotlight put on me. I just want to make sure when it comes down to the fine print we all know what we are dealing with.\u201d Hall also said he welcomed plans to replace the BBC Trust with a unitary board but had concerns about the how the board would be appointed and what mix of skills would be prioritised.  \u201cMy concerns actually are two-fold. One is how a board can work effectively and skills you need around the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThe executive board at the moment has mix of non-execs and skilled people from outside. It feels like both are trying to do the right thing by the BBC. I\u2019d prefer to start from the assumption of what skills you need to run an organisation like the BBC. I\u2019d like to spend time between now and charter trying to work that through.  \u201cThe second point is around appointments. It goes to the BBC\u2019s independence. The BBC is valued enormously in this country and abroad. And how we demonstrate the BBC board is independent; things will be discussed at unitary board that not just maters of how to spend money but editorially and creatively. Independence matters a lot. It\u2019s more subtle than I think we have got to at the moment in the white paper.\u201d The PAC was holding a special session to review the NAO\u2019s report into BBC handling of large-scale projects \u2013 three of which including the construction of a new set for EastEnders \u2013 were criticised for delays. However, BBC finance and operations boss Anne Bulford said delays were sometimes necessary.  \u201cI think if you find that there are opportunities to do better with a project you are dealing with, you need to take those,\u201d she said. \u201cDelivering the wrong thing at the right time or carrying unnecessary risk or missing opportunities to get better value for money out as a whole, I think, would be a mistake.  \u201cTrying to encourage early, frank, honest reporting both of forecasting boulders in the road and opportunity. Very often the delay is improving the delivery or competitive advantage.\u201d",
