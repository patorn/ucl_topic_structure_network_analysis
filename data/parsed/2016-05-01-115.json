  "body": "7 May 2011  The mood is mixed. Leicester finish 10th in the Championship with a chaotic but upbeat 4-2 home win over Ipswich. Sven-Goran Eriksson \u2013 hired expensively in October by the club\u2019s Thai-based 80% owners to clean up after Paulo Sousa\u2019s nine-game reign \u2013 reflects on his lot. \u201cAt one stage this season I could have bet we would finish in the play-offs. But we conceded too many goals all season, and today was typical. We must alter our approach.\u201d  18 May 2011  Thai owners Vichai and Aiyawatt Raksriaksorn buy the other 20%, and promise Eriksson a hefty budget. 27 June 2011  He rises to the challenge \u2013 spending \u00a315m on 13 players, including Leeds keeper Kasper Schmeichel. He later reveals he also fancies LA Galaxy\u2019s David Beckham (\u201che would be welcome\u201d), and shares the big vision: \u201cThe target is not only to reach the Premier League but to stay in it. And to reach Europe too.\u201d     Nigel Pearson returns, 2011.    24 October 2011  13 games later Eriksson is sacked \u2013 signing off after a 3-0 home defeat by Millwall. The owners change course and opt for a familiar face instead: Nigel Pearson rehired 17 months after he left for Hull. \u201cI am prepared to put myself into what is a pressure situation,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that positive pressure. Expectations are high, but that doesn\u2019t faze me.\u201d 30 January 2012  Pearson adds to Eriksson\u2019s spending, signing Ben Marshall from Stoke, and two others who will have a bigger impact: \u00a31m Danny Drinkwater from Manchester United, and \u00a31m Wes Morgan from Forest. 17 May 2012 Pearson leads his side to an untidy ninth-place finish, with just one win in the final four. The owners sanction another overhaul \u2013 with the most eye-catching move of the summer a \u00a31m deal for prolific 25-year-old Fleetwood striker Jamie Vardy, a record fee for a non-league player. Vardy says he hopes he can make the step up. \u201cI know the standard of the players is going to be a lot better. But I\u2019ve played in the FA Cup a few times this year and managed to do well against the league clubs. Hopefully I can carry that on.\u201d 5 October 2012  After another mixed start, the owners deny reports that they plan to sack Pearson and hire Harry Redknapp instead. \u201cNigel has and continues to retain our total support, and remains absolutely key to what we are trying to achieve. Our appetite and desire for success with Nigel as manager remains undiminished.\u201d Pearson shrugs it off. \u201cI don\u2019t know who is being mischievous in terms of these stories. It\u2019s a bit of an irritant but it\u2019s not going to alter how I work.\u201d Results stay inconsistent, but they reach Boxing Day in fifth. 21 February 2013 After a fine run of form lifts them to second, a sudden downturn prompts a loan deal: 19-year-old Harry Kane arriving from Spurs. \u201cHe\u2019s a player we know a lot about,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cHe will bring goals and a fresh impetus. It keeps the competition keen.\u201d Kane scores on his debut against Blackburn but his presence fails to stop the slide. City approach the final day having dropped outside the play-offs, needing a win away at Forest. But against the odds they do it \u2013 3-2, via a late winner from Anthony Knockaert. It secures sixth place. 12 May 2013 After winning their play-off semi-final first leg 1-0, Leicester travel to Watford, one game from Wembley. It\u2019s a day few will forget. 2-1 down in the 95th-minute, Pearson\u2019s side are given a penalty. Anthony Knockaert steps up \u2013 but Manuel Almunia saves both his shot and his follow-up. Then it gets worse. Watford launch a counterattack, and 20 seconds later it\u2019s 3-1 to the home side. Reporter Johnny Phillips, trying to describe it all in real-time for Sky, goes viral. Pearson says: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a worse way to lose.\u201d            11 January 2014 After regrouping over the summer, City fly through the first few months and are top by the turn of the year. Looking to cement the run, the owners sanction another deal: Pearson landing \u00a3350,000 Le Havre winger Riyad Mahrez. \u201cRiyad is a pleasing addition,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cWhenever we look to add to our squad, it has to be a player that will improve us while complementing what we already have. Riyad fits that description.\u201d 6 April 2014 With promotion secured and six games still to play, Pearson reveals how he did it \u2013 explaining he had to clear Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s costly \u201crubbish\u201d out of the squad to produce a winning formula. \u201cPeople want to talk about this season in isolation, but I keep telling them it\u2019s actually about what has been done over the last two-and-a-half years. One of the biggest jobs was to get rid of the rubbish \u2013 the players who don\u2019t have any value. We now have lots who can make this step up. I intend to keep them together.\u201d 22 April 2014 A 1-0 win at Bolton secures the title with two games to spare. They end the season having broken a string of club records, including a brilliant run of nine consecutive league wins. Pearson is named Championship manager of the year, while Schmeichel, Morgan and Drinkwater all make it into the PFA team. The owners, meanwhile, insist they can still comply with Financial Fair Play rules, despite announcing a \u00a334m loss for 2012-13. \u201cWe are highly confident of complying with league regulations.\u201d 25 June 2014 Pearson agrees a three-year contract extension, Vardy signs a four-year deal and summer signings include Villa\u2019s Marc Albrighton, Brighton\u2019s Leonardo Ulloa, former Inter star Esteban Cambiasso and QPR\u2019s Danny Simpson. Pearson sets out his vision for City\u2019s first season back in the top flight after a 10-year absence and rejects any talk that he might have to drop his low-profile, sitting-in-the-stands approach in favour of a more centre-stage, headline-making role.   I do think there is a lot of pressure on managers to behave in a certain way \u2013 this talk of \u2018passion\u2019 \u2013 which I don\u2019t always think is beneficial. I look at managers and think \u2018Are you acting? Are you playing the role that people want you to play?\u2019 For English managers it is almost as if you have got to act in that \u2018passionate\u2019 way \u2013 there\u2019s more slack cut for foreign coaches because they seem able to look \u2018thoughtful\u2019 \u2026 and then there\u2019s this talk about whether you wear a suit or a tracksuit. I don\u2019t intend changing how I look just because I\u2019m in the Premier League. I will wear a tracksuit.\u201d  21 September 2014 The promised tidy, low-key start to the season explodes into life with one of the top flight\u2019s great comebacks: Leicester, 3-1 down, beating Manchester United 5\u20133. It\u2019s the first time in 853 Premier League matches that United have surrendered a two-goal lead and lost. Vardy sets up his side\u2019s first, wins two penalties and scores the fourth. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 3-1 down against United, to win the game, I think it\u2019s a decent result,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cIt says a lot about the character. We\u2019ve got a bit more quality than people maybe think.\u201d 7 February 2015 But the feelgood factor fades fast. Two months after being fined for verbally abusing a Leicester fan during a defeat to Liverpool, the pressure on Pearson appears to tell again. In a bizarre moment, he holds down and mock-strangles Palace\u2019s James McArthur during a 1-0 loss. Asked why he refused to let go, he tells the press: \u201cBecause he said something to me. I\u2019m more than capable of looking after myself.\u201d Pearson is sacked \u2013 only to be reinstated hours later when the owners have a change of heart.     Pearson v James McArthur, February 2015. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester via Getty    14 March 2015 After a 0-0 draw with Hull \u2013 towards the end of an eight-game winless run \u2013 Pearson is asked by a reporter whether his bottom-placed side are \u201cwaxing or waning\u201d in the relegation run-in. \u201cI don\u2019t have to use that sort of analogy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are in the same position. We\u2019ve got 10 games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved to give us the best chance [of staying up]. That\u2019s it. You got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not. Waxing or waning? Fucking hell. My arse.\u201d 29 April 2015 A 3-1 home defeat to Chelsea stalls what looks like a dramatic late revival, ending a run of four straight wins which had lifted them to 17th. After the game Pearson says his players have been unfairly criticised by the press, then becomes involved in a row with a reporter who asks for clarification. \u201cI think you are an ostrich. Your head must be in the sand. Is your head in the sand? Are you flexible enough to get your head in the sand? My suspicion would be no.\u201d Reporter: \u201cProbably not.\u201d Pearson: \u201cI can, you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t.\u201d           Nigel Pearson\u2019s #Ostrichgate    16 May 2015 But the Chelsea defeat was just a blip: Leicester\u2019s dramatic recovery continues and they clinch safety with a game to spare, via a 0-0 draw at Sunderland. A final day 5-1 win over QPR completes a run of seven wins from their last nine games and they finish 14th \u2013 becoming only the third Premier League side to survive being bottom at Christmas. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in me trying to flower over it, I was relieved,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cIt\u2019s not been easy. But through it all we\u2019ve managed to stick together. That\u2019s the important thing.\u201d 30 June 2015 The close-season seems to start well. Aiming to cement that togetherness and build on the run-in\u2019s momentum, Pearson makes Robert Huth\u2019s loan move from Stoke permanent, and adds Christian Fuchs from Schalke and Shinji Okazaki from Mainz. But then, suddenly, it implodes. First, three Leicester reserves, including his son, are sacked over a racist sex tape, filmed while on a \u201cgoodwill\u201d tour to Thailand. Then, two weeks later, Pearson himself is out. The owners blame a \u201cfundamental difference in perspective\u201d. 13 July 2015 They turn instead to Claudio Ranieri \u2013 eight months after he was sacked by Greece following a humiliating defeat by the Faroes. Former players aren\u2019t having it. Gary Lineker calls it \u201can uninspiring choice\u201d; Robbie Savage says \u201cnot for me\u201d; and Tony Cottee is \u201castonished \u2026 It\u2019s a strange appointment.\u201d Ranieri signs Caen\u2019s N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and promises: \u201cI will squeeze all my energies into getting the best results.\u201d     Leicester unveil Ranieri. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester via Getty    13 August 2015 After leading his new side to a 4-2 opening day win over Sunderland, Ranieri faces his first crisis: the club handing Vardy a \u201csubstantial fine\u201d after video emerges of him using a racial slur at a casino in late July. Vardy, who opened the scoring against Sunderland, apologises for \u201ca regrettable error\u201d and keeps his place in the side \u2013 starring in a 2-1 win at West Ham two days later. Ranieri is pleased with the 100% start but plays it cool. \u201cWe can\u2019t think, \u2018oh we are top of the league\u2019. We have six points. That is what is important.\u201d 24 October 2015 Ranieri\u2019s squad, now in fifth but shipping goals, finally keep a clean sheet in a 1-0 win over Palace \u2013 and Ranieri delivers on his pledge to reward them with an afternoon at Peter Pizzeria in Leicester. \u201cThey deserve this pizza and today we will eat,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cFootball is like pizza. The most important ingredient is team spirit and the second is they enjoy training. That is important. Also to sprinkle a little luck is important, like salt. The fans are the tomato. Without the tomato, it\u2019s no pizza.\u201d 28 November 2015 Vardy, in breathtaking form, breaks Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s record of scoring in 10 successive Premier League games. \u201cI am really pleased with Jamie,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cWe can all be very proud. But the real target this season is 40 points to be safe, and now we have 11 to go. That is our project.\u201d Leicester go second, level with Manchester City \u2013 but a week later they go top, beating Swansea 3-0 via a dazzling Mahrez hat-trick. \u201cOur fans must keep dreaming,\u201d says the manager, \u201cbut we must stay calm. I just want 40 points.\u201d   Related: Leicester\u2019s Fantastic Foxes have taught the Premier League elite a lesson | Daniel Taylor    19 December 2015 Inspired by a tweet from Lineker (\u201cIf Leicester win the league I\u2019ll do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\u201d), Leicester win 3-2 at Everton. They reach Christmas Day in first place \u2013 having been bottom 12 months earlier. 2 January 2016 A mini-stumble \u2013 two draws and a defeat to Liverpool, with no goals scored. But a point won at Bournemouth does mean Ranieri can finally tick his box. \u201cIt\u2019s OK! 40 points, clean sheet, champagne for my players.\u201d 2 February 2016 Hollywood writer Adrian Butchart takes a break from his Jamie Vardy movie script to watch from the stands as the striker scores a 25-yard screamer in a 2-0 win over Liverpool. \u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cJust unbelievable what Vardy did.\u201d As pundits search for new ways to explain it, The Sun reveals the \u201cspooky stats\u201d that give the credit for Leicester\u2019s win-rate to Richard III. \u201cBefore the incredible discovery of the dead king\u2019s bones in 2012 it was a meagre 32%. Since he was reburied, it\u2019s a phenomenal 63%.\u201d 14 February 2016 A fortnight on, is this the long-anticipated wobble? Ranieri is unhappy with Danny Simpson\u2019s red card in a 2-1 defeat at Arsenal \u2013 but stays composed. \u201cWe carry on, and we smile.\u201d 10 April 2016 But now, after seven more games unbeaten and a gap opening up at the top, it\u2019s all too much. Ranieri is seen in tears of joy after a 2-0 win at Sunderland. He says later: \u201cYou do this job for the emotion you feel inside.\u201d 17 April 2016  Tension, and disbelief, mounts. As Spurs try to stay in touch, referee Jon Moss sends off Vardy in a frantic 2-2 draw with West Ham. Ranieri, though, does what he has done all season: absorbs the pressure, and looks to the positives. \u201cWe are in the Champions League, dilly ding, dilly dong! It\u2019s fantastic.\u201d  A week later, without Vardy, they deliver their biggest win of the season, 4-0 over Swansea. It sets them up to win the title at Old Trafford \u2013 five years and 24 hours after Sven\u2019s side were scraping a 1-1 draw at Doncaster. As BBC management give the go-ahead to Lineker presenting in his pants, Ranieri calls for one final heave. \u201cWe must finish this story like an American movie. Be strong. Be solid. This is history.\u201d     Living the dream: a young Leicester fan, pictured during April\u2019s win over Swansea at the King Power. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian",
