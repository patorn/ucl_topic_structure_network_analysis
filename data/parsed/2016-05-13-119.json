  "body": "Monday There has been much rejoicing in my neck of the woods at Sadiq Khan becoming London mayor. Partly because we\u2019re pleased that Zac Goldsmith\u2019s unpleasant campaign backfired so badly, but mainly because Sadiq lives on our road, is well liked and is often seen out and about in the neighbourhood. Our bit of Streatham \u2013 I know Sadiq says he comes from the rather more upmarket Tooting but he lives in a SW16 postcode, which is definitely Streatham \u2013 hasn\u2019t had a worthwhile celebrity since Cynthia Payne. We\u2019re also hoping there may be some knock-on benefits. The least we are expecting is an increased police presence, though the local force isn\u2019t as dozy as all that. Two years ago we reported our car stolen; six weeks later the police found it parked outside Costcutter just up the road. It turned out my wife had forgotten she had driven to the shops and had walked home. Tuesday     Models of diplomacy... The Queen with Justin Welby and David Cameron at Buckingham Palace. Photograph: Paul Hackett/AFP/Getty Images    There has been a certain amount of double standards about open-mic-gate. When David Cameron was caught telling the Queen that there were some fantastically corrupt countries coming to his anti-corruption away day, it was reported as yet another of his embarrassing faux pas. But as the Queen is technically infallible in the eyes of many parts of the media, when she did much the same thing later in the day by being overheard telling a senior police officer at a garden party that the Chinese had been very rude, it was the camera crew who got the flak from some quarters for having had the temerity to record the conversation, even though they were there at Buckingham Palace\u2019s request. The biggest surprise in all this is that the Duke of Edinburgh has emerged as a model of diplomacy. If anyone was going to insult foreigners, I\u2019d have put money on it being him. Wednesday Woody Allen doesn\u2019t always do himself any favours. After the premiere of his latest film, Cafe Society, at the Cannes film festival, Allen was asked if he had read Ronan Farrow\u2019s column in the Hollywood Reporter in which his son had argued that the media hadn\u2019t taken the rape allegations, made by his sister Dylan against their father, seriously enough. \u201cI never read anything,\u201d Allen replied. \u201cI never read what you say about me or the reviews of my film \u2026 I don\u2019t like to hear that a critic thinks my film is a masterpiece and I don\u2019t like to hear that a critic thinks my film misses.\u201d Er, yes, Woody. Except this wasn\u2019t written by a critic, it was written by your son. Confusing the two is a basic parental category error and one that might go some way to explaining why so few of his children have a good word to say about him. It\u2019s also not one that I\u2019m ever likely to make. To the best of my knowledge, my son has never read a word I\u2019ve written. And if he has, he\u2019s sure not going to make the mistake of admitting it.     Woody Allen and his estranged son, Ronan Farrow. Composite: Getty / Rex    Thursday The EU referendum campaign gets progressively more bizarre with the announcement of the TV debates. David Cameron doesn\u2019t want to debate with any Brexit Tories because he doesn\u2019t want to give the impression that the Conservatives are ripping one another to shreds. Even though everyone knows they are. Jeremy Corbyn will only agree to do a debate on the condition he gets equal billing with the prime minister. Even though he\u2019s never going to be asked on to the same platform as Dave because they are both on the same side. The Tory Brexit crew of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are outraged that ITV has invited Nigel Farage to speak on the grounds it believes one of the best known figures in the Out campaign is certain to drive undecided voters into the Remain camp. Given that the former London mayor changes his mind several times a day on most subjects, at this rate the only debate we are likely to see is between Boris and himself. Boris\u2019s improvisational skills are now getting out of hand. Despite being warned by the Treasury select committee not to use the figure of \u00a3350m as Britain\u2019s weekly contribution to the EU, he has had a metal plaque knocked up for him this week with the words \u00a3350m per week. Though that figure might be just referring to his weekly freelance earnings. Friday As the rows about Sats testing rumble on and with GCSEs and A-levels imminent, I count myself fortunate that my children are now past all that stress. Not least, because the few occasions when I did try to help invariably ended in disaster. For my daughter\u2019s A-level English, she was asked to write a coursework essay on the interpretations of love in Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, The Duchess of Malfi and Enduring Love. Fancying myself as a bit of a know-it-all on the subject, I basically wrote the entire essay. My daughter submitted it as a first draft and it came back marked as a total fail. Not only had I missed some of the key points \u2013 never forget that in an English exam there is only one right way to read a book \u2013 the essay was marked down for being extremely badly written. \u201cToo many short sentences,\u201d was one comment, I remember. My daughter rewrote the essay as her teacher suggested in long rambling sentences and got the grade she needed.",
