  "body": "Woody Allen, whose new film opens this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, has called the concept of artistic competition nonsensical. Speaking on the festival\u2019s first day, Allen \u2013 whose 47th movie, Caf\u00e9 Society, is not in contention for the Palme d\u2019Or \u2013 said that although in sport pitting people against one another was \u201cgreat\u201d, in culture it was \u201cagainst my common sense\u201d.  \u201cFor any group to come together and judge the work of other people is something I would never do. To make a judgment that this is the best, with the implication that in some platonic way it is the objective \u2018best\u2019, is something I don\u2019t believe in. So I don\u2019t want to participate in it.\u201d The president of this year\u2019s jury, George Miller \u2013 whose film Mad Max: Fury Road was the breakout hit of last year\u2019s festival \u2013 said he appreciated Allen\u2019s sentiment but it was \u201cbalanced for me by the simple joy of being here ... of seeing films that are new, watching them with consideration and then having a conversation. It\u2019s kind of a film camp.\u201d  The actor Kirsten Dunst also defended the concept of competition, invoking the work of her fellow juror L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes, whose Auschwitz drama Son of Saul was also at Cannes last year before winning the best foreign language Oscar in February. \u201cWithout film festivals, we wouldn\u2019t see movies like Son of Saul,\u201d she said. \u201c[And] we\u2019d just be in big blockbusters all the time.\u201d   Related: Caf\u00e9 Society review \u2013 Woody Allen's amiable, if insubstantial, tribute to golden-age Hollywood    Cannes celebrates its 69th edition this year; Caf\u00e9 Society is Allen\u2019s third film to open proceedings. A comedy that critics are acclaiming as something of a return to form, it is set in the mid-1930s and is a barbed love letter to old Hollywood. Narrated by Allen, it expresses repugnance with \u201ca town run on ego\u201d while also delighting in Los Angeles\u2019s Technicolor sunshine and Tinseltown razzle-dazzle. Jesse Eisenberg stars as a young New Yorker who heads to LA in the hope of finding work from his talent agent uncle (Steve Carell), and falls in love with the older man\u2019s assistant (Kristen Stewart). Although the film is sceptical about the effects of fame on the human soul, Allen suggested he was broadly in favour of such notoriety. \u201cThere are great, great upsides to it and great downsides. In my own opinion, after years in the spotlight, the perks far outweigh the downsides.  \u201cCelebrities often kvetch about the lack of privacy and being bothered by paparazzi, but these are not life-threatening problems and they get enormous advantage as they go through life.\u201d Allen was speaking in the immediate wake of the publication of a piece in the Hollywood Reporter by Ronan Farrow, Allen\u2019s estranged son, restating his support for his stepsister, Dylan. Dylan has in the past claimed Allen sexually assaulted her as a child, in the midst of his custody battle with her mother, Mia Farrow. All allegations were denied by Allen and following an investigation in 1993 no charges were brought. Ronan, who is Allen\u2019s only biological child (although his mother has hinted he might in fact be the son of Frank Sinatra, an ex-husband), took aim in his article at the Cannes film festival for celebrating Allen, at Hollywood for what he sees as collusion to silence victims of sexual abuse while offering a voice to perpetrators, and at specific stars for working with him. The subject was not raised at the press conference in Cannes. The director had vowed not to discuss it further after he wrote a piece for the New York Times two years ago again denying the allegations.  In 1997 Allen married Soon-Yi Previn \u2013 whom Farrow adopted with her second husband, Andr\u00e9 Previn \u2013 and the couple have two adopted children together, now in their late teens. Asked for his view on romance in relation to cinema, Allen said that he had always thought of himself as romantic, although this was a view \u201cnot necessarily shared by the women in my life\u201d.  \u201cThey think that I romanticise New York City, the past, love,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I probably do and it probably is foolish. But I was brought up on Hollywood movies and they had an indelible influence on me.\u201d The industry itself did, however, come under attack from Allen\u2019s stars. Stewart, who has transitioned from mainstream blockbusters such as Twilight to European arthouse contenders such as Olivier Assayas\u2019s Personal Shopper, which is also playing at Cannes, said: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely and undeniably an opportunistic, hungry, insane fervour that occurs [in Hollywood].   Related: Beyond Twilight: on the set of Personal Shopper with Kristen Stewart    \u201cMost people want to entertain people and make a bunch of money. It\u2019s not a bad thing. But if it doesn\u2019t hold hands with a genuine desire [to make artistically valid films] then that sucks and it\u2019s pretty rampant. Human beings are always clawing over each other to get on top. That\u2019s probably [true] in most industries. In Hollywood, it can have a surface nature that makes it more obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest popularity contest in the whole world. It\u2019s like you take high school and just make it in the real world. It simplifies everything. It\u2019s pretty intense.\u201d Meanwhile, Blake Lively, Stewart\u2019s co-star, said that the rapacity of the studios in the 1930s had been superseded by that of the press. \u201cNow it\u2019s more the media that is more dog-eat-dog and invasive,\u201d she said. \u201cThis thirst people have for knowledge, and if they don\u2019t have access they\u2019ll just make it up.\u201d Nineteen films are in competition this year, at a festival taking place under a slight shadow of anxiety. Security, which is always strict at Cannes, has been tightened this year at the behest of the local government, who are concerned the festival could be a target for terrorists. This is being intensified further for the opening night gala, which the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is expected to attend. His parents made the city their home in retirement; his father is currently unwell in the local hospital.  Meanwhile, the 80-year-old Allen said he could not compute his advanced years. \u201cI\u2019m so youthful, agile, nimble, spry, mentally alert that it\u2019s astonishing,\u201d he said, with tongue in cheek, having just berated the inefficacy of his hearing aids.  \u201cI eat well, I exercise, but what it is, is luck,\u201d continued Allen, whose own parents lived almost into triple figures. \u201cI don\u2019t feel old, I feel youthful. I\u2019m sure one day I\u2019ll wake up in the morning and I\u2019ll have a stroke or something and then I\u2019ll be in a wheelchair and they\u2019ll say: \u2018Remember him? He was Woody Allen and now look.\u2019 But until that happens I\u2019ll just continue to make films as long as people are foolish enough to put up the money.\u201d",
