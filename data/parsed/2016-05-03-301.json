Deep in a Sussex wood, at the approach of midnight, a dozen musicians and fans are gathered around a blossoming blackthorn bush. The latter have been waiting all evening to hear the headline act, while the former are standing by to collaborate with nature\u2019s most celebrated singer. They\u2019ve all read the early reviews (\u201cSingest of summer in full-throated ease\u201d \u2013 Keats; \u201cAs if some sudden gale had swept at once a hundred airy harps!\u201d \u2013 Coleridge), but no one\u2019s prepared for the strange music that erupts in surround sound from the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019s like a shot in the arm, like nature rinsing through you,\u201d says Mercury-nominated folk singer Sam Lee, who is tonight performing alongside a nightingale in a unique and slightly furtive collaboration between man and bird. A meditative trek into the mud and moonlight and a communion with nature, Lee\u2019s performances are also designed to extol mindful presence and the power of deep listening.

Nightingales winter in Africa and make their famous mating calls in Europe for just a few weeks in spring. They can be temperamental performers and save their flashiest repertoire \u2013 around 200 motifs from eerie whining through to manic chaffing \u2013 for darkness. Get the timings right, though, and a nightingale makes for an amazingly responsive musical partner. The males can throw their voices for miles, and will react to some human-made music. Essentially the birds are on the pull but, according to Lee, \u201cthey still have a lot to teach us about space and silence\u201d. In May 1924, a nightingale starred in the BBC\u2019s first live outside broadcast, \u201cduetting\u201d with cellist Beatrice Harrison as she played in her garden. It was the 90th anniversary of this event two years ago that inspired Lee\u2019s first nightingale walk. This year he has returned to perform 15 shows with a fuller and more ambitious set of musicians. One, an improvisational saxophonist, looks a little apprehensive as she unzips her tenor from its case and tiptoes towards the bush.      \u201cAs a lonely folk singer I\u2019ve developed a bit of a relationship with these birds,\u201d says Lee, who offers his audience a haunting ballad about longing for a fumble where the buds blossom. \u201cLast year, on the last night, I wept inconsolably all the way back to camp. It was like leaving a lover.\u201d Lee plans to make his musical trysts with the birds an annual occurrence. The magic, he says, shows no signs of wearing off. Sam Lee\u2019s Singing With Nightingales is at a secret Sussex location to 21 May",
