  "body": "Liverpool has been a good place to be these past few days. That April in 1989, it felt like something physical had changed in the city \u2013 as though someone had turned up the gravity. Everything felt heavier. Over the years, you got used to it, like the howling of a distant siren. Now, at last, we tread with a lighter tread. The police, the press and the politicians tried to make it about Liverpool. Those who miraculously survived that day came home to find that not only had they lost friends and family, they were now somehow implicated in their deaths. People such as Trevor Hicks, who lost two daughters and who described himself to me as \u201ca Thatcherite businessman until then\u201d. On the way to the match, one of his girls complained to him about the rudeness of the police. He said: \u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble, they\u2019ll be the first people you turn to.\u201d It was one of the last conversations they ever had. The police adopted a strategy of victim-blaming. Liverpool and football fans were the perfect victims. The story found a ready audience and their lies had traction long after they were exposed. When Steve Rotheram, MP for Liverpool Walton, made his celebrated speech in October 2011, he was allowed to use the word \u201clies\u201d \u2013 against normal parliamentary procedure \u2013 because in all the vast riches of English no other word would do. But only a year earlier, Jeremy Hunt, when he was \u2013 of all things \u2013 secretary of state for culture, media and sport had reiterated the whole \u201cfans were to blame\u201d libel. Now the matter is settled. Hillsborough was not about Liverpool. Hillsborough is not about the past. Yes, it was a long time ago and back in the day police corruption was commonplace, while health and safety was unheard of. But the 27 years that have passed are themselves a matter of scandal. To use the passage of time as a reason not to prosecute those responsible is ludicrous. The fact that this has taken so long is an extra charge to be laid at their door. But we would be compounding a great wrong if we allowed clowns such as Kelvin MacKenzie and Hillsborough police chief, David Duckenfield, to carry all the blame. Hillsborough, in ways that are not immediately obvious, has reshaped us. Like privatisation or the Iraq war, it changed everything. Murdoch was able to use what happened at Hillsborough not only to gain control of the Premier League but also to sidestep press regulations and monopoly commissions. The grotesque disconnect between fans and the clubs they love opened up here. More importantly, the ghoulish cabal that created the notorious \u201cthe truth\u201d headline \u2013 MacKenzie, some police officers and the late Tory MP Irvine Patnick \u2013 is the direct antecedent of the poisonous chumocracy whose mechanisms were briefly exposed during the hacking scandal. The fact that Murdoch is uncomfortably aware of how much he gained from Hillsborough and its cover-up was clear last Wednesday when his papers were the only ones that didn\u2019t lead on the verdict. The demonisation of working people did not begin at Hillsborough. But Hillsborough turbo-charged it. The transformation of the working class from salt of the earth to scum of the earth \u2013 from Coronation Street to Benefits Street \u2013 was the battering ram that cleared the way for benefit cuts and austerity. When Boris Johnson, in 2004, or Jeremy Hunt, in 2010, made their Hillsborough \u201cgaffes\u201d, they were not slips of the tongue. They were moments when the door was left ajar and we overheard how they talked about us when they thought we weren\u2019t listening. Or worse, they were a calculated manoeuvre \u2013 freshen up the libel, then wash your hands of it. Does that sound like a conspiracy theory? One of the most shocking things about the report of the independent panel was the revelation of just how vast and how calculated the conspiracy was. Even the families were taken aback. Hillsborough was not about Liverpool. But the cover-up, the indifference of the rest of the nation, the fact that Kelvin MacKenzie still has some sort of career as a kind of poor man\u2019s Katie Hopkins, have all fed into the city\u2019s consciousness. Children who were born years afterwards are painfully aware of the events of that April day. They are part of the city\u2019s identity in the way that Bloody Sunday is part of Derry\u2019s. What happened last week gives us the opportunity to take the toxins of paranoia and victimhood out of that inheritance. After the 7/7 bombings in London the press was, rightly, full of stories of the extraordinary heroism of ordinary commuters. There were acts of such heroism on 15/04 too, but we never had the chance to celebrate them because they were hidden behind the smokescreen. Now we have the chance to celebrate a different heroism \u2013 that of the families. The establishment tried to impose a narrative on Hillsborough. The families refused to accept it. Hillsborough is about the power of dignity in the face of humiliation, about the persistence of love in the face of loss, and the power that love has to change things. It\u2019s important to note the crucial role that women played in this story. It\u2019s also important to note that some of its heroes \u2013 Andy Burnham, Steve Rotheram, Bishop James Jones, to name just a few \u2013 belong to those very establishment institutions we so often vilify. The high points of the campaign were those memorial services at Anfield where faith groups, fans and politicians came together in a kind of new settlement when the wider political establishment was being discredited. At a time of social fragmentation and isolation they were expressions of a profound and purposeful sense of community .It was at one of these that Andy Burnham had his epiphany. Hillsborough is not about Liverpool. It\u2019s about all of us. The victory of the families tells us that we \u2013 all of us \u2013 deserve better and that we are capable of creating something better. At the last memorial service, the former Everton striker Graeme Sharp read Psalm 23. One way to translate that would be \u201cthough we walk in the valley of death, we do not walk alone\u201d.",
