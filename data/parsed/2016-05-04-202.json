Today, the Thai billionaire\u2019s retailer, King Power, has a near-monopoly in the country\u2019s major airports. And the \u00a339m he paid for Leicester City in 2010 looks, in retrospect, to have been a steal. It is not clear if Vichai is a gambler but, even if he did not bet on his team, the businessman has won big. Leicester could now be worth more than \u00a3436m \u2013 11 times what he bought the club for according to the New York\u2011based research firm Private Company Financial Intelligence. Not unlike the Foxes, Vichai\u2019s rise was hard to predict but his growing wealth has mirrored Leicester\u2019s success. Forbes puts the 58-year-old \u2013 who is worth an estimated \u00a31.9bn \u2013 at fourth place in Thailand\u2019s rich list in part due to the recent influx of Chinese tourists to the country.           Leicester City: their Premier League title glory in numbers    He is seen to have balanced support from both sides of Thailand\u2019s political establishment, who despise each other, and, importantly, the powerful monarchy. His name \u201cSrivaddhanaprabha\u201d was bestowed to him in 2012 by King Bhumibol, the world\u2019s longest serving monarch, for his success and charity work. And the Thai king\u2019s portrait has also been raised at the King Power Stadium. Despite operating for nearly two decades, it was only in 2006 that King Power managed to secure the exclusive rights to duty-free stores in Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi Airport, now the 12th busiest in the world. The contract was blessed by the Thai telecoms tycoon turned prime minister and former Manchester City owner, Thaksin Shinawatra. \u201cVichai has made his money by being close to politicians, that\u2019s how you have to do it,\u201d said a member of the Bangkok business community, who asked for anonymity. \u201cBefore that he was an average businessman.\u201d Although Thaksin was later ousted in a coup, Vichai survived and his business is still going strong under the current junta run by Thaksin\u2019s foes in the military. King Power continues to open new stores around the country. The virtual monopoly is so strong that when a Korean competitor recently tried to enter the market, it was allowed to start building a duty-free store in Bangkok but was later blocked from opening pick-up counters at the capital\u2019s two major airports. Without the pick-up counters, customers cannot receive their tax-free purchases. \u201cThey almost finished the building but they can\u2019t operate,\u201d the source said.

Photograph: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images    Vichai\u2019s prestige among Thailand\u2019s elite has been bolstered by his promotion of the nation abroad. The billionaire, who owns a Gulfstream business jet, has flown Buddhist monks to England to bless the stadium and the players. His son and club vice-chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, said this year that Thai values had rubbed off on the club. \u201cIt\u2019s the Thai culture. We give our time to the staff, the players and to the manager. We try to manage it like a family, to listen to the problems of every single member of staff,\u201d he said. Vichai promised in 2014, following the club\u2019s promotion to the Premier League, that he would spend \u00a3180m to reach the top five within three years. Two years later and with only a third of that money spent, Leicester have won the league. Aiyawatt, also know as \u201cTop\u201d, has a more public presence. He has played polo on the same team as Prince Harry and makes appearances at the King Power headquarters in Bangkok, where weekly games are streamed live. \u201cWe have 600 people come to celebrate and enjoy to watch Leicester, the team that maybe seven years ago no one knew,\u201d said Aiyawatt at King Power headquarters after Leicester\u2019s 4-0 win against Swansea City.

He has given free beer and donuts to supporters at the stadium and ticket prices rose only marginally after their promotion two years ago. He also subsidised buses to away games, capping tickets at \u00a310. The Foxes Trust chairman, Ian Bason, has applauded Vichai saying it \u201cwould be hard to criticise him at all\u201d. \u201cOther than what the club has actually achieved, [the owners] have always listened to the fans,\u201d Bason, whose supporters group was a former part-owner of the club, said. \u201cVichai has always respected the heritage of the club.\u201d Yet King Power has made money in other ways, not least by its global brand status, exploiting the club\u2019s fame by placing video adverts in Thai airport terminals showing the striker Jamie Vardy running around a duty-free shop in full kit while picking up gifts. The club\u2019s Thai-language YouTube channel has videos showing the Foxes emblem with \u201cPride of Thais\u201d underneath and the company sells collectable gift cards with photos of Kasper Schmeichel and Riyad Mahrez. Official shirts for the team, known locally as the \u201cSiamese Foxes\u201d, have sold out in Bangkok, though there are a few fakes still available on street stalls.           \u2018Walt Disney wouldn\u2019t script this\u2019 \u2013 Leicester City champions",
