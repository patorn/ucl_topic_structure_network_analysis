According to new research, if I\u2019m anything like the average person, around half the people I\u00a0consider my friends don\u2019t consider me theirs in return: that\u2019s how chronically bad we are at judging the reciprocity of friendship. Of course, I already knew lopsided friendships existed; I\u2019ve got several, and I\u2019m sure you have, too. But in every case I can think of, it\u2019s me who\u2019s not especially invested, and the other person who doesn\u2019t realise it. I\u2019m not supposed to be the desperate one. Yet if studies such as this are correct, the phenomenon is so widespread that it\u2019s highly unlikely I\u2019m an exception. As with the famous finding that almost everyone thinks they\u2019re in the top 50% of safe drivers, we can\u2019t all be the ones with an accurate sense of who really likes us. And if we\u2019re stumbling through life with such a distorted understanding of our social circles, where does that leave all the other received wisdom about friendship\u2019s importance? It has been found that friends keep us physically healthy, alive for longer, less vulnerable to depression and more financially successful \u2013 but how much of that, especially when the research is based on self-reports, comes from actually having friends, versus believing that you do? It also makes you wonder if there\u2019s a friendship version of that old (and true) observation about romance: that in any relationship, the person who cares about it the least controls it the most. Are we shackled to our lopsided friendships because we intuit that the other person still needs to be persuaded that it\u2019s worth hanging out with us? Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to learn that, when it comes to friendship, we\u2019re in the grip of an ego-boosting delusion: that\u2019s true in many domains of life. People with healthy self-esteem habitually overestimate both their interpersonal skills and their control over events; some psychologists argue that mildly depressed people have a more accurate grasp of their abilities than the non-depressed. To thrive in the world, it\u2019s often more useful to feel good about yourself than it is to see things as they are.   Related: Don\u2019t think you\u2019re lucky? Think again | Oliver Burkeman    Oh, and one more reason not to freak out over the thought that your \u201cfriends\u201d might secretly not\u00a0like you: this particular study, as with so many in social psychology, focused on university\u00a0students (and their friends and young\u00a0family members). It\u2019s well-known that our social circles shrink as we mature, too often culminating in a friend-starved old age. But isn\u2019t it possible that this shrinkage is better thought of as a winnowing, as we zero in on those friendships that are actually reciprocated? There are certainly reasons to worry about a loneliness crisis among the elderly, but having only a\u00a0few friends may not be good evidence for it. If I\u00a0make it to my final years with only a handful of friendships, because life has filtered them down to the ones that really count, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d call that a sad state of affairs. I\u2019d call it an efficient use of my remaining time. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com",
