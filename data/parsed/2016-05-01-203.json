  "body": "The Ninth 22 Charlotte Street, London W1 (020 3019 0880). Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a370 - \u00a3110 Jun Tanaka\u2019s restaurant on London\u2019s Charlotte Street does not have the most imaginative of names. It\u2019s called The Ninth because it\u2019s the ninth restaurant with which he\u2019s been involved. Then again, bluntness can be its own reward. Frankly, in an age when there are grown men who think Sexy Fish is a good name for a restaurant \u2013 rather than, say, an extremely niche category on Pornhub for people who get off on looking at trout \u2013 I\u2019ll happily settle for bland. Lord save us from marketing departments trying too hard.    The killer detail is the limpid pool of a perfectly clarified oxtail consomm\u00e9: it\u2019s the very essence of moo    For all its utility, the name quietly tell us an interesting story about the state of culinary ambition in Britain right now. A few years ago a chef like Tanaka, who has worked at the Capital with Eric Chavot, Le Gavroche and The Square, would be expected to rise through his eight previous brigades to emerge as the head chef of his ninth which would look like all the ones that had gone before. It would be a white tabled-clothed restaurant, the kind where dishes are plated on pieces of porcelain like egg shell, and delivered with hushed reverence to tables of long-married couples \u2013 the only ones who can afford the bill \u2013 who no longer have anything to say to each other. It would be the kind of place where nobody ever admitted to farting. Instead we are getting chefs like Tanaka, sodden with both technique and talent, who are arriving at this point, their interest in formality now happily misplaced. They just want to feed. And so The Ninth, a perfectly formed little restaurant with food that swings between \u201cbloody lovely\u201d and \u201coh my gosh\u201d. Sure, it ticks lots of boxes marked London 2016. The bare brick walls leave you wondering if all those brilliant Polish plasterers have finally taken offence at the Brexit campaign and pissed off home. There are hefty leather banquettes and dark wood floors and those cage things over the bar that please the eye, but must be a nightmare to stack with glasses. Naturally, the waiter takes your order without a notepad and the dishes are all made for sharing. There are many you will want to keep for yourself.     \u2018The high smoky tang of a bonfire hovers over it\u2019: the flamed mackerel. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    The joys start early with a puffed up pillow of freshly made pitta, the shape of an inflamed kidney, the crisp outer skin crusted with oregano and salt. You tear it apart to reveal a fluffy crumb and a smell like your table was suddenly a baker\u2019s shop. It is a classy opener. We hold on to some of that bread to dredge through the fiery watercress pur\u00e9e that lies beneath two perfect orbs of oxtail croquette, the strands of long-braised meat spun through with fresh green herbs. If this was served as a cocktail party canap\u00e9, I would force whoever had the tray to stand in the corner of the room, their escape blocked, until I had cleared the lot. At lunch there\u2019s a short list of dishes at \u00a317 for two plates and \u00a321 for three. From that, a crispy duck, blood orange and pomegranate salad feels like a playful riff on duck a l\u2019orange, the high fruity notes gently forcing the bird into submission. A sizable ravioli of salt cod with a liquid egg yolk at its heart, is one of those dishes that puts technique in the service of pure pleasure. It\u2019s a whole bunch of complicated things \u2013 the making of a pasta as silky as a Terry Thomas cravat, the balance to the cod brandade, the cooking time that leaves the egg yolk flowing across the plate \u2013 resulting in comfort. It\u2019s nursery food for grown-ups. From the raw and cured list, there\u2019s a whole uncooked mackerel fillet, lightly flamed so that the high smoky tang of a bonfire hovers over it. Then the fish has been dressed with a fine dice of capers, cucumber and dill, the acidity both setting the protein and keeping the whack of the seashore in its place. Sizable pieces of celeriac are charcoal roasted and served up with smoked almonds and wild garlic.     Best possible taste: the salted beef cheeks. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    Best of all is a plate of ox cheeks, given the salt beef treatment. This is a truly spectacular plateful. Cheeks do a lot of work so they can be tough old blighters. Unlike salt beef from brisket, which tumbles away into strands, this is tender to the fork but maintains its own internal tension. The pieces of cheek are topped with gossamer slices of bone marrow, rings of morel and podded green beans, like spring has dropped its nubile buds all over your plate. There is a scoop of finely acidulated and diced onions and green herbs to cut through the heftiness of the meat. But the killer detail is the limpid pool of a perfectly clarified oxtail consomm\u00e9 in which all this sits; it\u2019s the very essence of moo. If this liquid, lip-smackingly rich in gelatine, dropped below room temperature you just know it would form a jelly, as any good beef consomm\u00e9 should. Oh how I would love to get all those hucksters and charlatans currently flogging bone broth as if it was a thing (it\u2019s called stock) to line up, sip some of this, and then realise they are wasting everybody\u2019s time and money. Then they could head off to do something more socially useful, like robbing banks. It barely needs saying, but to make a dish like this you need the kind of formal training that only Tanaka\u2019s eight restaurant-long career so far could gift him.     \u2018A beautiful thing\u2019: the caramelised tarte tatin for two. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    Not everything thrills. From that lunch menu a dense, brassica nettle \u201crisotto\u201d, shoved in inverted commas because it\u2019s made with pearly grains of fregola, is slippery and heavy rather than comforting. You can tell it\u2019s good for you, without appreciating it being so. An overly heavy hand with the herbs in a rosemary ice cream makes it taste like a chemically scented candle smells. It\u2019s distracting. But the tarte tatin for two that it accompanies is a beautiful thing, all chewy caramelised pastry, and apples that quiver and fall apart when nudged with a spoon. Ask for it with their vanilla instead. The Ninth is not a unique restaurant in London right now. I can think of a number of places \u2013 Piquet, Blanchette and Terroirs, for starters \u2013 delivering great food at a reasonable price in relaxed surroundings. But there is a precision and, at times, an understated brilliance to this restaurant which does set it apart. Let\u2019s put it this way: I don\u2019t think Tanaka need move on to his 10th establishment any day soon. Jay\u2019s news bites \u25a0 Generally, numbers slip into restaurants\u2019 names courtesy of the address. Hence: 40 Maltby Street, in a railway arch south of London\u2019s Tower Bridge. This is a wine business, with a food operation attached. But for a secondary trade the robust cooking is far better than it ever need be. The changing menu throws up the likes of skate wing alongside salsify fritters or black pudding with salt cod and rabbit (40maltbystreet.com). \u25a0 An intriguing pop-up called Thornback comes to Leeds from 12-15 May, led by Brett Barnes, formerly of the city\u2019s Reliance pub. He will cook a six-course British seafood menu with Ronnie Murray, group head chef for Mark Hix. Tickets are available from leedsindiefood.co.uk. \u25a0 Harrogate restaurant Norse has introduced airline style \u201cdynamic\u201d pricing to take on the city\u2019s chains. On Mondays prices will be discounted by 25% , with the discount dropping 5% each day until Friday. Owner Paul Rawlinson said he\u2019d consider the impact of the trial at the end of May (norserestaurant.co.uk). Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",
