  "body": "Ross & Rachel. You know the ones. Will they? Won\u2019t they? On. Off. On again. Off again. On a break. Vegas. James Fritz\u2019s play isn\u2019t about Ross Geller and Rachel Green, the ultimate Friends-turned-lovers. But it\u2019s not not about them. The unnamed couple in Fritz\u2019s play are in their mid-40s, a prom queen and a geek, stuck in a marriage that seemed meant to be \u2013 only no one told them life was gonna be this way. This is the one where they stay together for the kids. It\u2019s the one with the brain tumour. The one that rubbishes the very idea of The One. \u201cI\u2019m a big romantic,\u201d says Fritz, a tall, trim 28-year-old with an air of confidence. \u201cBut why are we so obsessed, narratively speaking, with the unification of two people being a win, being the ultimate ending? You get into a dangerous place when you start talking about oneness and, like, \u2018we belong together\u2019. These bits of language are meant with the best of intentions, but serve to make the person on their own half of a whole.\u201d Ross & Rachel gives form to that. It\u2019s a dialogue for one; a monologue with two characters. In Thomas Martin\u2019s production, a big Edinburgh fringe hit about to play New York  before beginning a UK tour, Molly Vevers plays both partners as they wrestle with their relationship. He\u2019s convinced they\u2019re made for each other. She\u2019s having doubts.     Molly Vevers in Ross & Rachel at the Edinburgh festival in 2015. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian    The title does a lot of work. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to spend the first act selling a couple,\u201d Fritz explains. \u201cPop culture is so all-pervasive that, even if you\u2019ve never seen an episode of Friends, you know what Ross and Rachel means, in the same way you know what Romeo and Juliet means.\u201d He\u2019s adamant Ross & Rachel isn\u2019t \u201ca sequel to Friends\u201d,  nor is it written from an entirely cynical place. \u201cI love Friends,\u201d he protests. \u201cI\u2019ve seen every episode several times. Growing up, it was the ultimate background noise, so it\u2019s in my bones and in a lot of other people\u2019s bones.\u201d While writing, he swore not to rewatch a single episode to avoid alienating audiences with in-jokes. After the Edinburgh run, however, he allowed himself a Netflix binge. \u201cI felt really guilty for co-opting these people I knew so well.\u201d Where once playwrights made literary allusions, Hamlet references and the like, now they are increasingly feeding off pop culture. Fritz points to Anne Washburn\u2019s Mr Burns, which traces a Simpsons storyline through an oral tradition in a world without electricity. \u201cYou needn\u2019t have seen The Simpsons to enjoy that show, it\u2019s just about the principle that pop culture is a kind of currency.\u201d Shutting that out or ignoring it \u201cseems silly. You have that shorthand with everyone in the room.\u201d To date, Fritz\u2019s played have picked at our mediatised lives. Four Minutes Twelve Seconds, which won an Olivier award last year, centred on a teenager\u2019s sex tape that went viral. In Lines, he imagined theatre eating itself, penning a verbatim play about a verbatim play.     Anyebe Godwin (Nick) and Kate Maravan (Di) in Four Minutes Twelve Seconds by James Fritz. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    It\u2019s a conscious choice. \u201cSo much of what we consume is mediated.\u201d Out of that, he believes, \u201cit\u2019s a lot easier to buy into comfortable readymade narratives\u201d \u2013 be they happily-ever-after romances or straight-A students not shooting homemade porn. Theatre, by contrast, allows complexity and slipperiness. \u201cI love the failure of it, how it can never be perfect. We can never have ownership over the way someone reads a piece of theatre.\u201d As playwrights go, Fritz is self-made. Most young writers come through individual theatres or writing schemes. Since completing an MA at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, Fritz has been writing on spec, entering new writing competitions and producing his writing with friends. In January, he was named most promising playwright by the Critics\u2019 Circle \u2013 despite none of his plays having been commissioned. Did he feel supported during that time? Fritz watches his words: \u201cI feel very supported now, is what I\u2019ll say, but it\u2019s like any job, you can\u2019t expect it all as soon as you\u2019ve started. There were moments where I wanted to pack it all in.\u201d Another play, Parliament Square, about a woman protesting outside the House of Commons, was among the winners of this year\u2019s Bruntwood prize, for which scripts are submitted anonymously. It\u2019s now in development at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange theatre.     \u2018I love the failure of theatre, the fact it can never be perfect\u2019 \u2026 James Fritz. Photograph: Hampstead Theatre    \u201cIt feels like a really interesting time to look at the act of protest, what it means, how we interpret it. That line between looking after the self and how much responsibility we have to the rest of the world \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of big, messy themes in there. It\u2019s far and away the hardest thing I\u2019ve written.\u201d The words of a playwright on a roll \u2013 not on a break. \u2022 Ross & Rachel is at 59E59 Theater, New York (part of Brits Off Broadway festival), from 17 May to 5 June. Its UK tour begins at Marlowe theatre, Canterbury, 17 June. Box office: 01227 787787.",
