  "body": "There\u2019s no real controversy over the Sun and its \u201csignificantly misleading\u201d lead headline in March that bellowed \u201cQueen Backs Brexit.\u201d You only had to read the story to know that it didn\u2019t match the big type: it was a thin litter of \u201cimpeccable\u201d anonymous sources telling alleged tales from a time long before there was any referendum and thus any opportunity to leave or remain. Do you blame editor Tony Gallagher, for gritted-teeth bluster in the face of Independent Press Standards Organisation condemnation? Je ne regrette rien. It\u2019s what he\u2019s supposed to do \u2013 and Sun readers can find a more rational account on page two. But there is one strand in the verdict worth spinning on for a while. Above \u201c\u2018Queen Backs Brexit\u2019 was another headline saying \u201cExclusive: bombshell claim over Europe vote.\u201d Gallagher wrote in an editorial last Wednesday: \u201cIt seemed fair enough to us. Tabloid newspapers like the Sun have long made eye-catching assertions in headlines alongside a smaller headline to qualify or attribute them. It is a standard device.\u201d Which, alas, seems dismally true of this entire referendum campaign. Bombshell shock \u2026 Obama backs the Mau Mau \u2026 Every family will be zillions poorer \u2026. Isis slaughter votes Out for carnage \u2026 Hitler inspired Remain campaign. If the public, at this point, has anything coherent to say to press and politicians alike, it is please put away your \u201cstandard devices\u201d. The real bombshell shock this June would be weeks of facts, honesty and grey, dispassionate sober forecasting \u2013 not crazed \u201ceye-catching assertions\u201d. Who needs Twitter? Not Rupert Who can define the power of love? You may answer poetically, clinically, statistically or, in the case of Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall, social medially. Once Rupert got hitched, episode four, he suddenly stopped tweeting. Love doesn\u2019t need 140 words. Sociability beats any media.",
