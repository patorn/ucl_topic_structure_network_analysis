  "body": "My partner Sam and I wanted to discover the secret of American barbecue. We gave up our jobs in the UK and busked our way from California to the deep south. The US version of a barbecue is quite different to ours, it\u2019s all about smoking meat in a \u201cpit\u201d for a long time at low temperatures. Everyone thinks Nashville is a little honky-tonk town in the middle of Tennessee. It\u2019s actually quite a commercial place, the beating heart of all the major record companies \u2013 there are cowboys walking around with guitars and Stetsons, but they tend to be commercial artists. And it\u2019s not just country music \u2013 Jack White from the White Stripes has his main studio there. Broadway, the main strip, is cheesy and tacky, but great for a laugh. One of the most famous bars is Tootsies, known for craft beer and moonshine. Every bar in Nashville has live bands, and the musicianship is unbelievable, even at the smallest joints.

It\u2019s where the Grand Ole Opry used to be broadcast from, the famous country and western radio show. Now it\u2019s an amazing venue where you can catch the best up-and-coming artists \u2013 the acoustics are fantastic. On our quest to find the best barbecue in Tennessee, we discovered Puckett\u2019s. This fantastic joint in Leiper\u2019s Fork, just outside Nashville, has a massive custom-built smoker outside, and meat is served off the pit. American barbecue is a male-dominated scene, so as women we were a bit of a novelty. Lots of chefs shared their secrets and recipes. It\u2019s wood smoke that gives the meat flavour, so you might use apple or cherry wood for chicken, oak or hickory for beef. It\u2019s not marinated; you dust it with dry rub, and oil activates the flavour. We fell in love with the side dishes, too: mac\u2019n\u2019cheese, smoky beans, all sorts of salads.     Puckett\u2019s of Leiper\u2019s Fork, near Nashville, which has a huge barbecue pit    Craft beer is huge in America. In some bars, even on Broadway, you\u2019ll find 200 types. The choice is overwhelming. Prop yourself at the bar and work through them. I recommend Fat Cow, brewed in North Carolina. Lots of older, retired musicians live in Franklin. In this quaint little town 30 miles from Nashville, you\u2019ll find everyone from Glen Campbell\u2019s drummer to the harmonica player for House of Blues. It\u2019s in the middle of amazing countryside and we hung out there like proper hillbillies.

Or it\u2019s about a four-hour drive to Memphis. You really do need a car to explore the US. We fell in love with ribs in Memphis \u2013 the best are St Louis pork ribs with Memphis dry shake at the Charlie Vergos Rendezvous restaurant. And there\u2019s so much to do there, from Gracelands to the Martin Luther King museum. Nashville is the home of the cowboy boot. I bought my first pair of handstitched boots at Tony Lama. You can pay from $200 to $2,000. There are thousands to choose from in all colours, short ones, long ones \u2026 Then you\u2019ve got to decide the toe: a classic round C, a winklepicker, or a J, which is somewhere in between.     Nashville\u2019s Broadway strip. Photograph: Alamy    People from Nashville are super-friendly. Don\u2019t be surprised if you end up staying in people\u2019s houses and making new friends \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of hospitality you get in the south. You can go there with a plan, but the plan is subject to change because you meet some amazing people \u2026 and they\u2019re likely to pass you around their friends. Our restaurant, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen is in the old Pumphouse in Barry. We\u2019ve brought a taste of the deep south to the deep south of Wales, giving people the most authentic barbecue experience we can. Beyond that, though, there are no similarities \u2013 the two places couldn\u2019t be more different!  \u2022 The Hang Fire Cookbook (Quadrill, \u00a320) by Samantha Evans and Shauna Guinn is out now. To buy a copy for \u00a316 including UK p&p, go to bookshop. theguardian.com",
