  "body": "Seven months and counting In 1972 the law was passed that allowed the UK to join what was then called the European Economic Community (EEC). Despite Europe\u2019s current crises, it\u2019s unchanging, fundamental challenge was expressed that year by Sicco Mansholt, then president of the European commission, probably better than by any of the current voices in the referendum campaign, whether for or against UK remaining in. \u201cWill the EEC become a powerful agent for improving living standards and opportunity in solidarity with less fortunate countries?\u201d asked Mansholt, \u201cOr will it remain a select inward-looking club of some of the world\u2019s richest nations? Will it continue to produce \u2018bigger, faster and more\u2019 for \u2018some\u2019 to the detriment of the global environment and the welfare of the \u2018rest\u2019?\u201d Leap forward 20 years to the Rio Earth summit where Europe lobbied hard, and Germany and France floated the idea of a World Environment Organisation to counterbalance the World Trade Organisation, and commission president, Jacques Delors, said Europe would lose credibility if: \u201cThese agreements signed in Rio remain a dead letter and do not give birth to ambitious policies that respond to the scale of the challenge that faces us.\u201d In the near half century since Mansholt framed Europe\u2019s challenge, rather than working to resolve such tensions, however, two contradictory dynamics have taken hold.  Named after the cities where they were set, they became known as the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas. The Lisbon agenda, following a summit in 2000, focused on Europe\u2019s growth and competitiveness, meant to deliver jobs and social cohesion. Gothenburg came a year later when it was clear that the explicit environmental objectives written into the Maastricht treaty underpinning Europe were marginalised by Lisbon\u2019s expansive economic focus, and likely to suffer. Gothenburg\u2019s strategy pushed environmental priorities again and called on the economic, social, and environmental effects of all policies to be jointly assessed and coordinated. Since then, Lisbon\u2019s objectives were undermined by the sheer economic inflexibility of having a single interest rate across an already very unequal European single currency zone. Yet these still take priority, for example in negotiations for the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States, over Europe\u2019s more progressive environmental ambitions, threatening to leave them as Delors\u2019 \u2018dead letters.\u2019  Such lifeless letters are incapable of matching the speed and scale of the Paris climate accord that wishes to halt overall warming by at least 2C, and move to the lower figure of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Arguments in favour of old-style economic expansion dominate the campaign to remain in Europe, sidelining and selling short the progressive case to build the architecture of international cooperation to address the crises of climate change, inequality and the unaccountable powers of finance. There remains considerable denial about the tension between a neo-liberal growth agenda, and the kind of economy that can effectively support a social and environmental Europe. Just as there remains some tenacious and occasionally flippant denial about climate change itself. When the free London newspaper Metro reported potentially record high temperatures for a day in May, instead of registering even feint concern about what it might indicate as part of a long-term trend, it encouraged readers to celebrate the good news by treating yourself \u201cto a long lunch break.\u201d In fact, new figures from Nasa were about to show that, globally, the preceding month, April, was the seventh month in a row to break temperature records, and the third month in a row in which the records had been broken by margins that were themselves records as well. In the midst of this, reflect on whether, imperfect and contradictory as Europe\u2019s machinery is, it would be easier or harder to coordinate climate action without common institutions and the negotiation of joint, principled action? The history of the often recalcitrant roles played by the United States, Canada and Australia, let alone other major petro-states, suggests not. With some irony, the campaign for the UK to remain in the EU has ignored more obvious popular appeals, such as to Britain\u2019s annual and permanent \u2018solar migrants\u2019 enjoying either holidays, retirement or long-term relocation to warmer parts of Europe \u2013 taking with them, unquestioningly, health insurance and a wide range of benefits guaranteed by EU membership. It\u2019s often not just about the weather either, but cashing in the difference in value between typical UK house values, pensions and savings for a higher standard of living in lower income European states \u2013 a sort of reverse economic migration \u2013 again, unquestioned, and another irony. The urgently-needed rapid transition from \u2018bigger, faster, more\u2019 for a few, to an economy of \u2018better, not bigger\u2019 for the many, and on a timescale to avoid irreversible climatic upheaval, will take us all into largely unchartered territory. In this new place for civilisation, the ability to cooperate and coordinate will mean the difference between looking forward with hope to the future, or being trapped in an endless battle against the impact and consequences of irreversible climate change. Our societies also have an extensive, historical back catalogue of making rapid transitions happen, pushed at different times by everything from conflict to technological opportunity, politics, environmental change and economic collapse. But, we don\u2019t need to feel that all we can do is react to changes happening out of our control.  A new, evolving initiative, involving a wide range of people and organisations is beginning to explore what can be learned from moments of rapid transition. From them, adapting lessons for today, we may identify the special circumstances and social, economic and political chemistry in which rapid, low carbon, economically successful and socially progressive transition becomes possible. The EU began as a positive experiment \u2013 even if one in conflict with itself \u2013 to both rebuild nations and prevent the catastrophe of future conflict. I\u2019d like to think that we can still change it and put it to good use without playing out the old joke: Question: How many revolutionaries does it take to change a light bulb? Answer: You don\u2019t change it, you smash it!",
