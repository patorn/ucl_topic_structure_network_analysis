Club Deportivo Palencia said on their Twitter feed: \u201cWe sincerely thank @Ingenova and @KappaItalia for \u2018giving the skin\u2019 in this project.\u201d       The Castillan club\u2019s bizarre new kit is the brainchild of Juan Francisco Martin, who was also responsible for a tuxedo-themed strip worn by the Spanish second division side Cultural Leonesa. His latest offering evokes memories of a kit designed for the Colombian women\u2019s cycling team, which made them look naked below the waist and was described as unacceptable by Brian Cookson, the president of the UCI.",
