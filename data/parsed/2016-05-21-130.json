  "body": "Isle of Wight 9-12 June  Britain\u2019s shrinking southern island boasts some truly golden oldies this year, with headliners the Who and Queen (fronted by Adam \u201cCamp Elvis\u201d Lambert), plus dad-friendly sets from Iggy Pop and Status Quo. Worried they won\u2019t be talking about your generation too? Don\u2019t sweat it. Sigma, Jess Glynne and a DJ set from Pendulum round out a lineup with something for everyone. Download 10-12 June      The main stage at Download Festival    The \u201cmetal one\u201d does exactly what it says on the tin. Rammstein close day one, Black Sabbath day two, and Iron Maiden nail shut Sunday. Clearly, Leicestershire\u2019s Donington Park is the definitive place to rock the hell out this summer. Expect a ratio of beards to hairless chins normally only seen at a cereal cafe. Parklife 11-12 June  Heaton Park, Manchester, hosts the seventh year of the UK\u2019s fastest-growing festival \u2013 with the Chemical Brothers, Major Lazer and one of two exclusive UK gigs from Ice Cube (the other is at Wild Life in Brighton). At a little over \u00a3100 for the weekend, it\u2019s hard to get more bang for your buck. Glastonbury 22-26 June     The Who on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury. Photograph: Alamy    How do you top the outrageous Kanye West? Glastonbury\u2019s answer this year is: you don\u2019t. You play it safe, with three of the most bankable behemoths in the business. Coldplay, Muse and Adele will likely give fans exactly what they\u2019re expecting, but there\u2019s plenty of excitement lower down the bill, from the effortless cool of Grimes and Skepta to the nostalgic, only-at-Glasto feelz of Cyndi Lauper and Art Garfunkel.  British Summer Time 1-10 July     British Summer Time    Not your traditional festival, but rather a series of six ludicrously starred-up one-day events in Hyde Park; for Londoners, BST combines the buzz of a Pyramid stage headliner with the relief of a tube ride home. This year\u2019s can loosely be divided into Cool Day (Massive Attack, Young Fathers); Big Day (Florence + the Machine, Kendrick Lamar); Basic Hipster Day (Mumford & Sons, Alabama Shakes); Carole King Day (Carole King); Mother\u2019s Day (Take That, Olly Murs); and OMG IT\u2019S STEVIE WONDER! (and Pharrell Williams) Day. Wireless 8-10 July When it comes to R&B in Britain, nobody does it better. London\u2019s Wireless 2016 may not be the best ever \u2013 it lacks the star quality of last year\u2019s Minaj-Drake-Lamar holy trinity \u2013 but with Calvin Harris to close the first night, plus Chase & Status, Miguel and Boy Better Know, it will still be easy to keep dancing for three days straight.   T in the Park 8-10 July     Biffy Clyro at T in the Park 2014. Photograph: PR    Scotland\u2019s biggest festival boasts half the best names from all the rest \u2013 including Calvin Harris, Disclosure, the Stone Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Mexican acoustic guitar sensation Rodrigo y Gabriela. Time to make like a besieging medieval army and set up camp outside Strathallan Castle, Perthshire. Latitude 14-17 July The Suffolk fest\u2019s top line is pretty solid \u2013 the Maccabees, New Order and the National headline \u2013 and further down things get exhilarating, with Grimes, Christine and the Queens, and a UK exclusive set from Balkan brass and ukulele fans Beirut. And then, of course, there\u2019s the usual joyful mix of theatre, comedy and every other art form under the sun. End of the Road 1-4 September     End of the Road festival. Photograph: Andrew Novell    Now in its 10th year, this boutique festival held at Larmer Tree Gardens north of Bournemouth has built a reputation as the perfect end to a wild summer. There\u2019s an egalitarian spirit to the place, with its lack of VIP areas, and this year\u2019s bill rivals any other: Joanna Newsom, Broken Social Scene and Bat for Lashes stand out in an eclectic lineup. Bestival 10-13 September     Bestival.    Rob Da Bank\u2019s annual last hurrah \u2013 known for its dance music focus and even-more-fancy-dress\u2013than-usual dress code \u2013 claps us out for the year with Hot Chip, Major Lazer, Diplo and the Cure. Gloriously daft entertainment comes in the form of Mr Motivator, Mexican wrestling and last year\u2019s breakout stars the Chuckle Brothers. THE BEST OF THE REST Lunar 3-5 June  Super Furry Animals, Mercury Rev and Television headline the third year of this mystical Warwickshire bash. Born & Bred 4-5 June Wiley + Slimzee and Novelist top the bill at Hackney\u2019s youthful dance party. Field Day  11-12 June PJ Harvey headlines and the Avalanches return \u2013 expect east London to get crazy as a coconut. Wild Life 11-12 June Disclosure, Rudimental and Ice Cube at an airport in Brighton. What\u2019s not to love?
