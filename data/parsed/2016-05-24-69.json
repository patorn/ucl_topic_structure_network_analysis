  "body": "A deal which will see disaster victims being given cash instead of vouchers or food, and which requires aid agencies to be more transparent and efficient in the way they spend money, is generally seen as the most significant step forward at the UN\u2019s first ever aid summit this week. But there was no progress on the growing problem of breaches of international humanitarian law - from bombing of hospitals to fighting in built-up areas - which are leading to horrifyingly high rates of civilian death and injury. And some felt that important opportunities for radical change to the system had also been missed. Four years in the making, the World Humanitarian Summit - the first time the humanitarian sector has ever come together on such a large scale - was conceived by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon as a way to draw attention to the growing global humanitarian crisis, where global costs have risen from $3.7bn in 2004 to $2obn last year. But it also aimed to look at the sector itself, generally seen as an ad hoc system evolved for dealing with one-off emergencies and now put under untold strain by the demands of long-running crises like Syria or Sudan over the last decade.   Related: 'We are demanding change': the Somali woman taking on international NGOs    After months of anxiety within the sector that the summit would be a closed UN shop and would bring about little real reform, most admitted to being pleasantly surprised by the Grand Bargain, a mutual agreement between donors, who will be more flexible and give more directly to local organisations, and aid agencies, who will have to make serious changes to the way they work. $1bn a year can be cut from aid spending by back-room efficiencies, believes one of the deal\u2019s architects, the EU commissioner Kristalina Georgieva. Speaking to the Guardian, Georgieva pointed out that the big donors and aid agencies had all signed up; \u201cEven more signed up than we hoped for. Now, we need to make it happen. If we don\u2019t reform, shame on us.\u201d \u201cIt is really exciting,\u201d said Charlotte Lattimer, of Global Humanitarian Assistance which tracks spending in the sector. \u201cAt the moment we know very little about what happens to the money after it passes from donors to UN agencies and international NGOs. We know that it is often transferred on to other organisations before it reaches people in need, but lack of reporting prevents us from understanding those transaction chains better. Publishing to IATI on funding given and how it\u2019s spent can begin to transform that.\u201d   Related: \u2018It's like trying to hit a football field from the top of Everest' \u2013 why aid airdrops just don\u2019t work    One of the most contentious issues in the sector has been the unfair distribution of aid, with less than 2% of all funding going directly to local NGOs despite the fact that, according to relief chief Stephen O\u2019Brien, they take the majority of the risks. The Grand Bargain commits to a target of 25% of funding by 2020, a move described by Degan Ali, head of Kenyan NGO Adeso, as \u201cone of the successes of the whole WHS process.\u201d But she added that \u201cWe need to work to ensure that this target is not static and keeps increasing year on year.\u201d The newly-launched Network of Empowered Aid Response (of which Ali is one of the founders), a global network of local and national NGOs, will aim to keep that pressure on. The plan to move to a wider use of cash transfers has also been widely welcomed. They\u2019re increasingly seen as more efficient than vouchers or food, more empowering and a useful stimulant for the local economy. Other positive initiatives include the launch of an international education fund for children in emergency situations. On refugees, campaigners said the summit had seen mixed results. There was progress in understanding refugee crises as drawn-out challenges needing long-term developmental responses, rather than just short-term aid hand-outs. But few countries seemed interested in upholding international treaties like the refugee convention, or in resettling significant numbers of refugees from the developing world. Andreas Kamm, head of the Danish Refugee Council, said \u201cPoliticians and decision-makers are fleeing from institutions like the UN that could actually make a difference [in resettling refugees]. I\u2019m not an optimist in the short term on burden sharing \u2013 if we can\u2019t do it in Europe, within a union, how can we expect it to happen globally?\u201d   Related: The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for'    The no-show by heads of state from the G7 (Angela Merkel was the only high profile western leader to attend) was noted by both Ban Ki Moon and Turkish prime minister Recep Tayip Erdogan as respectively \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cquite upsetting\u201d. This may also have been a factor in the failure to make any progress on international human law (IHL). At a International Committee of the Red Cross conference in December, even the very gentle suggestion of a voluntary forum for member states to discuss best practice on IHL was rejected, and progress on this issue seems increasingly difficult. \u201cThe problem we\u2019re seeing now is that we are no longer dealing with soldiers who have been trained in humanitarian law, we\u2019ve got actors who have no formal military training, and the situation is just worsening,\u201d said Michael Adamson, head of the British Red Cross. Final judgements on the summit are still being formulated. Dr. Danny Sriskandarajah, secretary general, CIVICUS, hoped that some of these agreements could \u201csignal the beginning of the end of the development industrial complex which involved a few rich countries providing aid through a few big players\u201d. Head of ODI Sara Pantuliano, Managing Director at the Overseas Development Institute felt the \u201ccommitments made at the Summit have fallen short in substance and ambition\u201d. But many others felt that just bringing the whole sector together like this was worthwhile. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever all met up like this,\u201d said Sean Lowrie, head of the Start Network. \u201cI\u2019m so used to going to meetings and seeing the same faces over and over again. It\u2019s been invigorating, refreshing to see how big and wide the humanitarian sector is. For that, if for nothing else, it\u2019s been worthwhile.\u201d Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow@GuardianGDP on Twitter.",
