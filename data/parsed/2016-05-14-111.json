Should he ever prove half as good a president as they say he is a father, he could expect a place on Mount Rushmore. Trump follows in a long tradition of men trying to have it all: the White House and a family. All 43 American presidents have been fathers, although in five cases, including George Washington, it was through marriage or adoption rather than biology. If Hillary Clinton wins in November, she will be the first mother in the role of commander-in-chief. Presidency and parenthood is the subject of a book, First Dads: Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama, written by journalist and historian Joshua Kendall and published this week. Kendall suggests family relationships have often been key to understanding presidents and their world-changing decisions, and can say a good deal about their character. \u201cI think Obama\u2019s the only president ever to do diapers,\u201d Kendall said on Thursday. Trump has already made clear his view that diaper-changing is women\u2019s work. The author makes the case that biographers have tended to neglect the way presidents have gone about parenting nearly 200 first children. Study of the archives and interviews with numerous presidential offspring suggest that a great president does not necessarily a great dad make. Founding father Thomas Jefferson, for example, was America\u2019s most articulate advocate of freedom, Kendall argues, \u201cbut with his daughters he was a control freak\u201d. Herbert Hoover was an absentee dad.  Franklin Roosevelt, meanwhile, was such a workaholic that his sons had to make appointments to see him. After losing the use of his legs, he leaned on his sons when he made speeches.  \u201cThey were parentalised,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cTo the nation he was a nurturing father but to his own sons he was the opposite.\u201d Lyndon Johnson, a noted master of networking who once said: \u201cI never think about politics more than 18 hours a day,\u201d devoted rather less attention to his daughters Lynda and Luci. Lynda used to read issues of the Congressional Record in a bid to get noticed. Richard Nixon regularly slept in his office and found little time for his daughters, Tricia and Julie. Then there was Ronald Reagan, beloved by conservatives, a champion of family values who was famously close to his second wife, Nancy. His relationships with his own kids, though, were distant and complicated. Obama dotes on his daughters, Malia and Sasha, and is said to always go home for dinner at 6.30pm. Critics may wish he would take a leaf out of Johnson\u2019s book and spend some of that time wining and dining members of Congress, who have reputedly seen him as cold and aloof during years of deadlock. According to Kendall, trying to match political and parental records is a fool\u2019s game. \u201cThey are two different spheres,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitics is about personal relationships and family life is about building personal bonds. People like to elide the two but they are different skill sets.\u201d His book also considers the impact fatherhood has, via the Oval Office, on the course of history. Washington, for example, was an appealing choice as chief executive once America had escaped the clutches of King George III in part because he did not have biological heirs who might expect a monarchical succession. William Howard Taft, meanwhile, was torn between whether to run for president or seek a supreme court appointment. He decided on the former in part because he thought it would be more beneficial for his sons. The death of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 11-year-old son, Willie, in 1862, is thought to have hardened his attitude to fighting the civil war. In 1924, Calvin Coolidge\u2019s 16-year-old son, Calvin Jr, died from blood poisoning brought on by an infected blister. The president was devastated.  Kendall said: \u201cI argue that his depression might have caused the Great Depression.\u201d Just last year, the death of Joe Biden\u2019s son, Beau, from brain cancer at the age of 46 was critical in the vice-president\u2019s decision not to run for the White House in 2016. More optimistically, according to Kendall, Woodrow Wilson\u2019s three daughters \u2013 Margaret, Jessie and Eleanor, all in their early 20s \u2013 encouraged him to get behind universal suffrage. Anna Roosevelt probably saved FDR\u2019s life in 1944 by insisting that he have a medical check-up, which led him to reduce smoking and drinking. Her care helped him get through the crucial talks at Yalta with Churchill and Stalin. A reference by Jimmy Carter to his teenage daughter, however, was arguably a factor in his defeat by Reagan in the 1980 election. During a televised debate, the incumbent remarked: \u201cI had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms.\u201d  Republicans pounced, gleefully claiming Carter was taking foreign policy advice from a 13-year-old. Famously, Amy Carter liked to roller skate in the east room of the White House. Her doll\u2019s house is now on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, in Washington. Less happily, first children have endured early deaths, psychiatric problems such as depression and substance abuse, \u201cstaggeringly high\u201d divorce rates and a few suicides. Kendall noted that John Adams, \u201can authoritarian father and authoritarian president\u201d, warned his son, John Quincy Adams, that he would either be president or a failure.  \u201cJohn Quincy Adams rose to the occasion,\u201d he said, \u201cbut two other sons drank themselves to death.\u201d Poignantly, Kendall interviewed Carter\u2019s son, Chip, and found him \u201cburned out\u201d after spending his early life \u201cpropping his father up\u201d at the expense of a rounded childhood.  \u201cEvery once in a while children make the most of the benefits but other times they crash and burn,\u201d Kendall said. On a happier note, there was family life with Theodore Roosevelt, at 42 the youngest president in American history. He staged pillow fights and played bear, using an upturned table for his den.  \u201cHe had a young family and they loved playing in the White House,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cHe used to stop working at three o\u2019clock and go and play tag in the attic.\u201d Kendall has also interviewed Eric Trump, son of the presumptive Republican nominee, who said the only way he connected with his father was through work. Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric, all in their 30s, are executive vice-presidents of the Trump Organisation and prominent campaign surrogates.  Trump is what Kendall describes as a \u201cpreoccupied dad\u201d. In this, and perhaps this alone, he is at one with FDR.",
