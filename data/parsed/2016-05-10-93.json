David Cameron and the Queen           David Cameron heard saying Queen \u2018purred\u2019 over Scotland\u2019s no vote    The slip on Tuesday was not even the first to include David Cameron and the monarch. A week after Scotland\u2019s independence referendum, a news camera microphone recorded the prime minister telling the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that the Queen had \u201cpurred\u201d down the phone to him after the success of the no campaign. It is convention that private conversations with the queen should be kept off the record, and Cameron later said he was embarrassed and sorry about the incident. Nicolas Sarkozy, Barack Obama and Binyamin Netanyahu At a G20 summit in 2011, a private exchange between Barack Obama and the then French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, was inadvertently broadcast to journalists. \u201cI cannot stand him \u2013 he\u2019s a liar,\u201d Sarkozy said of Netanyahu. \u201cYou\u2019re fed up with him?\u201d replied the US president. \u201cI have to deal with him every day.\u201d Gordon Brown and Gillian Duffy            One of the most memorable on-mic blunders came during the 2010 general election campaign, when Gordon Brown was heard calling Gillian Duffy a \u201cbigoted woman\u201d after she confronted him about levels of immigration in Rochdale.  Brown was then played his remarks live on air and apologised immediately. Half an hour after the incident, a large bouquet of orange and yellow flowers was delivered to Duffy\u2019s house. George W Bush and Tony Blair            The public got a rare insight into the workings of international diplomacy when a conversation between George W Bush and Tony Blair during a lunch meeting at the 2006 G8 summit in Russia was caught on microphone. \u201cYo, Blair. How are you doing?\u201d Bush can be heard saying to Blair. The pair go on to discuss how to put pressure on Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad to stop attacks on Israel by Hezbollah. \u201cThanks for the sweater, that was very thoughtful of you. I know you picked it out yourself,\u201d concludes Bush. \u201cI knitted it,\u201d replies Blair. Prince Charles and Nicholas Witchell            During a press conference at the Swiss ski resort of Klosters in 2005, the BBC\u2019s royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell irritated Prince Charles by asking how he and his sons were feeling about his forthcoming marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles. \u201cBloody people, I can\u2019t bear that man. I mean, he is so awful, he really is,\u201d the Prince of Wales was heard to say under his breath. Jacques Chirac on Britain \u201cThe only thing the British have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow disease,\u201d the then French president, Jacques Chirac, was heard to say in a meeting with the German and Russian leaders, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Vladimir Putin, in 2005.  \u201cAfter Finland, it is the country with the worst food,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cOne cannot trust people whose cuisine is so bad.\u201d The comments were made in earshot of reporters, but a spokesman for Chirac said subsequent press reports did not reflect \u201cthe tone or the content\u201d of the exchange.  John Major and the Bastards The term \u201cthe Bastards\u201d, used to refer to Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, emerged in 1993 when John Major was recorded using the term to describe three of his own cabinet members. The three were presumed to be Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo. Major made the comments following an interview with ITN\u2019s political editor, Michael Brunson, when he did not realise his voice was still being recorded. He was also heard pondering \u201chow such a complete wimp like me keeps winning everything\u201d. Ronald Reagan on Russia            While warming up for his weekly radio address in 1984, the US president, Ronald Reagan, was recorded saying: \u201cMy fellow Americans, I\u2019m pleased to tell you today that I\u2019ve signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.\u201d In another brief voice test for audio technicians in 1982, Reagan referred to the Polish military government as \u201ca bunch of no-good lousy bums\u201d. Tony Abbott jokes about climate change           Peter Dutton overheard joking with Tony Abbott about rising sea levels    The then Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, a fervent climate change sceptic despite Australia\u2019s high per capita carbon footprint, was overheard sharing a joke about rising sea levels on Pacific islands with his immigration minister, Peter Dutton. They were discussing a Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea before a community roundtable on the resettlement of Syrian refugees. But the laughs turned to awkward silence when the then social services minister, Scott Morrison, pointed out they may be being picked up by the boom mic overhead.  Abbott\u2019s leadership was punctuated by similar gaffes and he was actually removed as prime minister the next day.",
