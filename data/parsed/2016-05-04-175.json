  "body": "Since 12-year-old Flint resident Jeremiah Loren contracted a debilitating bacterial infection that has rankled his stomach, his grades have dropped dramatically, he\u2019s missed four months of school this year, and there are days he doesn\u2019t even get out of bed. Jeremiah, who has tested positive for elevated blood lead levels, first contracted the infection a few months after Flint switched its water supply to a corrosive local river. His mother, Tammy Loren, attributes his illness directly to the Michigan city\u2019s contaminated water supply. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way for him to [have] contracted it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has abdominal pains so bad where he can\u2019t get up out of bed. He\u2019s constantly fatigued and dizzy.\u201d As Barack Obama treks north to Flint on Wednesday at the behest of an eight-year-old resident, he\u2019ll be greeted by a city ensnared in a cascade of ongoing issues similar to the Lorens\u2019. The water crisis, now entering its third year, has done more than shatter residents\u2019 trust in their government; there are potentially long-term health consequences, a lack of funding to remove the network of lead piping, and an unnerving reliance on bottled water, as officials have yet to declare it\u2019s safe for residents to drink their tap water without a filter. \u201cThey don\u2019t give a damn about us and they ain\u2019t been giving a damn about us,\u201d said Nayyirah Shariff, 39, an activist and member of the Flint Democracy Defense League. \u201cLike we\u2019re a poor community, so they\u2019re like screw poor people \u2026 screw people of color? They just don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d Republican governor Rick Snyder, who first publicly admitted six months ago that Flint residents had been exposed to high levels of lead in the water supply, has repeatedly apologized for his administration\u2019s role in the crisis but has sought to distance himself from criticism for his months-long delay. On Monday, the governor traveled to Flint \u2013 without notifying the public \u2013 to meet a restaurant owner and speak about what had been accomplished to address the crisis. But two years after a Snyder-appointed emergency manager oversaw the city\u2019s transition to drawing its water from the the Flint river, prompting widespread complaints about discolored and smelly water, residents say the effort has been wholly inadequate. What\u2019s more, they say, there remains a disconnect from the needs of the majority-black city, where more than 40% of residents live below the poverty line. \u201cFor me, the way that you act, it determines your values and what you hold important,\u201d Shariff said. \u201cThe fact there still hasn\u2019t been a proper response to this is absolutely insulting. We\u2019re just like second-class citizens.\u201d     Nakiya Wakes, of Flint, Michigan. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP    Flint\u2019s water supply became contaminated with lead in April 2014, after the source of the city\u2019s drinking water was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint river. Water from the Flint river had for months corroded lead from inside of water pipes before flowing into households across the city. Nearly $70m has so far been appropriated by the state to reconnect Flint with Detroit\u2019s water system, conduct testing for lead and provide bottled water to residents. The governor activated the national guard to assist in the state\u2019s response. An additional $165m has been proposed for further measures and a federal declaration of a state of emergency meant $5m in additional federal aid.  Snyder said on Tuesday that he expected the state legislature to approve expanded Medicaid coverage for children and adults up to age 21, but lawmakers have delayed approving the measure for more than two months. Other residents pointed to the lack of bottled water delivery to homes, forcing many to amend their daily routine to travel to pick up bottled water at fire stations across the city. \u201cIf they really wanted to have an authentic response, [then] why do we have to drive around and get water?\u201d said Shariff. \u201cWhy do they wait over two months for Medicaid expansion.\u201d One of the major priorities of Flint mayor Karen Weaver has been replacing all of the lead pipes in the city to prevent leaching from those that have been irreparably corroded. Flint has replaced lead service lines for 33 homes since Weaver launched a local effort in March, and officials are preparing efforts for 400 additional homes, said Kristin Moore, spokesperson for Weaver\u2019s office. But Weaver estimates the city would need $55m that it doesn\u2019t have to complete pipe replacement. Snyder told reporters this week that the state is \u201cgoing to continue to help get the lead service lines out\u201d, and about $2m has been appropriated for the effort \u2013 enough to remove about 500 lines in a city that has been estimated to have about 15,000. \u201cThe city has been waiting for state and federal lawmakers to pass bills that would cover the $55m cost of replacing every lead-tainted service line in Flint,\u201d said Moore. \u201cIt no doubt would lower the per-home cost to replace the pipes if contractors were bidding on $55m worth of work rather than $2m.\u201d  Though Obama\u2019s visit has created a glimmer of optimism, some believe the trip should have occurred months ago. The president was in Detroit for the North American International Auto Show in January, where he addressed the \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d of Flint. \u201cI feel like Obama should\u2019ve been here,\u201d said Nakiya Wakes, 40, a resident and activist. \u201cIt took a little girl to write him for him to come.\u201d Shariff agreed, but said the president\u2019s visit speaks volumes about Michigan\u2019s governor, who has yet to hold a public forum to meet with residents impacted by the crisis. \u201cWhat does it say that Obama lives in the White House in DC, and he can meet with Flint residents before Snyder can?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he lives 40 minutes away in Ann Arbor.\u201d It\u2019s the role of Snyder, who installed a succession of four emergency managers to address Flint\u2019s finances, that draws the most vocal criticism in the city of 100,000. The governor has rebuffed calls to resign, even as the crisis prompted a recall petition.     Activist Nayyirah Shariff. Photograph: Ryan Felton for the Guardian    The 57-year-old former venture capitalist, who won the 2010 gubernatorial race without ever having served in office, has attempted to pin blame for the crisis on \u201ccareer bureaucrats\u201d who interpreted federal lead regulations too narrowly. But a Snyder-appointed taskforce reviewing what happened in Flint found, in March, that the state\u2019s role was the most significant in causing the crisis. The report highlighted the numerous instances when Snyder\u2019s top aides expressed alarming concerns about Flint\u2019s water supply, long before the governor acknowledged it wasn\u2019t safe for Flint residents to drink. The delayed response in conducting a timely review of the system could result in a $1bn price tag from multiple lawsuits that have been filed at the state and federal level. Civil fines may also be levied as a result of an investigation by Michigan\u2019s attorney general, who has already charged two state environmental officials and a Flint employee with multiple felonies. The investigation, along with nearly a dozen other probes, is still pending. Snyder tapped more than $1m in public funds for criminal and civil attorneys to assist in his office\u2019s response to the litigation and public records requests, but his spokesperson has said there won\u2019t be a \u201cneed\u201d for a criminal defense. Snyder has been chided by critics for using public funds in that capacity, especially as Flint residents call for additional funding to address the water crisis.   Related: Flint water crisis: three state and local officials face first criminal charges    \u201cHe may be the singularly most tone deaf politician that I have ever known in my career,\u201d said Flint\u2019s congressional representative, Dan Kildee. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in his heart. But based on what he says and what he does, he just doesn\u2019t get it. This is a community in crisis, and what we don\u2019t need is an accountant\u2019s calculation as to the minimum amount of support that he can provide.\u201d The governor is expected to meet with Obama on Wednesday, according to his spokesperson. Details have yet to be confirmed. Snyder has tried to encourage Flint residents in recent weeks that tap water is safe to drink, if filtered, by drinking the city\u2019s water himself. But for Wakes, the move has her feeling d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - Flint\u2019s former mayor uttered a similar refrain last summer, as the city\u2019s lead contamination slowly emerged. Wakes recently had her water tested by members of a nonprofit founded by actor Mark Ruffalo \u2013 tests that revealed substantially higher levels of lead than what Michigan\u2019s environmental department found at her home. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve been consuming in these few years that we\u2019ve been drinking this, besides lead, so how can y\u2019all say that the water is safe?\u201d Wakes said.",
