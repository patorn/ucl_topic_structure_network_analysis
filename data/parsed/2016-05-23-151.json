  "body": "The writer and film director Alexandre Astruc, who has died aged 92, personified the gap between theory and practice. In his crucial and influential 1948 essay La Cam\u00e9ra-Stylo (The Camera-Pen) in L\u2019Ecran Fran\u00e7ais, he wrote of the cinema becoming \u201ca means of writing as supple and as subtle as that of written language\u201d. He called for an end to institutional cinema and for a new style that would be both personal and malleable. He was convinced that the cinema would replace the novel, but first the cinema must become more like the novel, in that cin\u00e9astes could express their obsessions and thoughts, even abstract ones, at the level of profundity and significance of an essay or novel. This was the first loud clarion call taken up by the young directors of the French New Wave a decade later, expanded and modified by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, who formulated the politique des auteurs \u2013 the idea that a film should reflect its director\u2019s personal vision. Unfortunately, with his own films, Astruc struggled to practise what he preached. Born in Paris, the son of journalists, Huguette (nee Haendel) and Marcel, Astruc was one of the youthful literati surrounding Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in the St-Germain cafes after the war. He studied law and literature, then worked as a journalist and assistant director on a few films, including Marc All\u00e9gret\u2019s British-made melodrama Blanche Fury (1947). He also co-scripted Marcel Achard\u2019s Jean de la Lune (1948) and Marcello Pagliero\u2019s The Respectful Prostitute (1952), based on Sartre\u2019s play of the same name. Because of his influential articles on the future of cinema, expectations were high when he attempted to make two short 16mm films, in 1948 and 1949, but they were amateurish efforts. However, The Crimson Curtain (Le Rideau Cramoisi, 1952), a medium-length feature, made some impact. Based on a 19th-century mystery story by Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly about a maid in love with a conjuror who is also a thief, it contained no dialogue. Instead it pushed the voiceover experiments of Robert Bresson in his Diary of a Country Priest, of the year before, to an extreme. The narrative device placed the film between dream and memory, with haunting nocturnal photography and Anouk Aim\u00e9e\u2019s inscrutably romantic performance.

Photograph: Inconnu/AFP/Getty Images    The lovely and enigmatic Aim\u00e9e also featured in Astruc\u2019s second feature, Bad Liaisons (Les Mauvaises Rencontres, 1955), which also relied heavily on a voiceover narration. One Life (Une Vie, 1958) was Astruc\u2019s refined treatment of the Guy de Maupassant novel, catching the sexual tensions of the original and the 19th-century country milieu through Claude Renoir\u2019s richly textured, almost impressionistic, colour camerawork. Then, as the new young directors, ex-critics such as Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol, influenced by the cam\u00e9ra-stylo theory, started making their own movies, Astruc, abruptly leaving the 19th-century novel momentarily, made his own contribution to the Nouvelle Vague with his best film, Shadows of Adultery (La Proie pour l\u2019Ombre, 1960). However, the Nouvelle Chic might have been a more appropriate way of categorising it, with its white sports cars, cocktail parties, a recording studio, modern skyscrapers, jazz and Bach on the soundtrack and quick, slick cross-cutting. The theme, a feminist one, concerned a wife (Annie Girardot), who tires of merely being a social asset to her husband and finds an outlet by running an art gallery and taking a lover. In the end, she sacrifices both men for her independence. Astruc then returned to the 19th century, with adaptations of Gustave Flaubert (Lessons in Love/L\u2019Education Sentimentale, 1962), and Edgar Allan Poe for television (The Pit and the Pendulum, 1964). In fact, from the mid-1960s, he retreated into television, emerging rarely into feature film territory. In 1976, Astruc (behind the camera) and Michel Contat put together Sartre By Himself (Sartre Par Lui-m\u00eame), a fascinating three-hour documentary based on six hours of interviews held with Sartre in 1972, in which the philosopher spoke of his personal and intellectual life and his oeuvre, surrounded by his friends, including De Beauvoir, the singer and actor Serge Reggiani and the actor Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier. For his film version of Jean Giono\u2019s Les \u00c2mes Fortes (The Savage Souls, 2001), the prolific avant-garde fabulist Ra\u00fal Ruiz, knowing of Astruc\u2019s love and knowledge of the Proven\u00e7al novelist, asked him to co-write the screenplay. It was Ruiz\u2019s recognition of how considerable a contribution Astruc had made to the history of film theory. Astruc is survived by Elyette H\u00e9li\u00e8s, his wife since 1983. \u2022 Alexandre Astruc, film director and writer, born 13 July 1923; died 19 May 2016",
