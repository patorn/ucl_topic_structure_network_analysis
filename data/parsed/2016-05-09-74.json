  "body": "With the aid of a cane the 70-year-old British film director Terence Davies bounded up to the podium at New York\u2019s Museum of the Moving Image to warm the crowd with a little praise. \u201cYou have a lot to be proud of. My great debt is to American musicals. The American Songbook is the greatest gift to the world.\u201d The multiple award-winner, whose early works are music-drenched kaleidoscopic reflections of post-war Liverpool, exuded buoyant Americanophilia stating \u201cthe only good musicals are American,\u201d before taking a snipe at Britain\u2019s \u201cAndrew Rice Pudding\u201d. Davies is on these shores just as Sunset Song, his adaptation of Lewis Grassic Gibbons\u2019 novel that the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw calls \u201csad, sombre and deeply satisfying\u201d, makes its American debut. The Museum of the Moving Image is running a retrospective through this month, and Sunday\u2019s triple-feature was a thorough soak in Davies\u2019 inimitable blend of stylized, melancholy memory. 1988\u2019s Distant Voices, Still Lives is as moody and emotional as ever, a whirl of a family portrait suffering under a violent father, finding warmth in song in their tight-knit working class community. The Terence Davies Trilogy, three short films from 1976 through 1983, show the director growing into his unique, non-linear form, oftentimes making associative leaps based on music cues. There are also specific moments, like a bully\u2019s torment or first homosexual awakenings, that are later replayed in Davies\u2019 1992 triumph The Long Day Closes.   Related: Sunset Song review \u2013 Agyness Deyn roams a stunning Scottish landscape    It was for the screening of The Long Day Closes where Davies joined the audience. Introduced by Sony Pictures Classic\u2019s co-founder Michael Barker as \u201can impossibility\u201d that mixes documentary style and poetry in a magical way, he urged viewers to just \u201clet it wash over you\u201d. (He also joked that the opening credits, a lengthy still shot of a vase of flowers, were \u201cinterminable\u201d but that\u2019s probably on purpose.) The Long Day Closes essentially picks up where Distant Voices, Still Lives leaves off, though perhaps a tad less experimental as it focuses on a lead character (a Davies proxy, age seven) and doesn\u2019t jump through time quite so much. In the post-screening question-and-answer session with Michael Koresky, the editorial director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and author of a book about Terence Davies simply called Terence Davies, Davies was blunt about this period of his childhood: \u201cNothing particularly interesting or momentous happened, but it was a paradise.\u201d A lifetime later Davies retains an extraordinary ability to recall the details, like the buttons on the dresses of two neighbors who sang Londonderry Air to him while walking back from the pictures. \u201cThose were four years of happiness, aged seven to 11.\u201d It was at age seven when his abusive father died and, as he put it, \u201cwe began to live\u201d. At age 11 he entered a secondary school, all-boys, and was tormented from without and within. As a strict Catholic who thought his gay impulses were unique to him, he \u201cprayed until his knees bled\u201d. There\u2019s a bit of foreshadowing of this coming conflict in The Long Day Closes, with a vision of, as Davies described, \u201ca very hot JC \u2013 seethe! seethe!\u201d played by the same actor as a shirtless bricklayer that the lead character watches through the window. (\u201cIf you look closely you\u2019ll see the name of the garage was called Smitten\u2019s. Criminal!\u201d) As Koresky gushed about The Long Day Closes (\u201cone of the greatest films ever made, and that\u2019s becoming a widespread accepted truth!\u201d) Davies shrugged and thought it would never make it out of the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s just about my family, and how we were drenched in American culture.\u201d He talked about American music, like Charles Ives \u201cfor whom I have a soft spot because he married a woman named Harmony Twitchell, it\u2019s so lovely!\u201d) and Debbie Reynolds, whose recording of \u201cTammy\u201d is used in the film\u2019s most celebrated sequence.

He nicknamed me \u2018Bud\u2019 and gave us peanut butter and chewing gum and a percolator. We drank tea and had no idea what to do with it, so we used it for paintbrushes.\u201d This beau\u2019s extravagant gift of a bottle of Chanel No 5 became a scene in Distant Voices, Still Lives, and got one of the only big laughs earlier in earlier in the day. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d Davies joked, \u201cI\u2019m really good at death and misery.\u201d In person, though, Davies is sharp and witty and, when not reciting lengthy Shakespeare quotes from memory, is eager to discuss his methods. \u201cI tell my actors not to act, to feel it, otherwise we\u2019ll know it isn\u2019t true.\u201d His newest, Sunset Song, stars Agyness Deyn, who gives an outstanding performance, but is not exactly a household name. \u201cI make my actors read, and some won\u2019t do that.\u201d Davies then told a story from Hollywood, in which he had an appointment with a well-known personality. After waiting an hour, Davies left (\u201cI had more important things to do!\u201d) and then caught the actor in a car in front of the hotel. After accusing him of being an hour late, the actor cried out, \u201cWait, wait, I can do a magic trick!\u201d and proceeded to move the roof of his convertible up and down. \u201cThis is who we\u2019re dealing with!\u201d Davies sighed, adding \u201cI don\u2019t cast big names.\u201d  Terence Davies and Agyness Deyn will show Sunset Song on Tuesday at Museum of the Moving Image, followed by another Michael Koresky Q&A that will hopefully be equally as insightful and amusing as Sunday\u2019s. Davies\u2019 films will play through 22 May.",
