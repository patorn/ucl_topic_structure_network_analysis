Traditional residential blocks and narrow streets were deemed unhealthy and suppressive, and the utopian vision was of streets in the sky and grand boulevards for the motorcar. European engineers were sent in flocks to the US to learn from the environments in which these revolutionary ideas were playing out, returning with tabula rasa development plans to realise their own modernist dreams. Many cities still bear the battle scars of the planners\u2019 ensuing \u201cenlightened experiments\u201d.      Copenhagen in the 1960s. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images    In Britain, vast swathes of the city of Birmingham were gutted to make way for an inner ring road, which placed cars on the surface and buried many footpaths and road crossings beneath the built-for-speed streets. In Stockholm, the Essingeleden motorway was opened in 1966 to traverse the city\u2019s islands. It was soon repainted from six to eight lanes, but this failed to make a dent on congestion levels \u2013 it remains the busiest road in Sweden.    We were lucky that Copenhagen was poor after the second world war  S\u00f8ren Elle     While concrete was being poured to create other giant urban spaghetti junctions across Europe, Copenhagen found itself at a crossroads: \u201c[It] has reached a state of development where it is necessary to develop a network of motorways through the city to secure its arterial functions. [The motorways] will change the appearance of the city,\u201d wrote architect Ole N\u00f8reg\u00e5rd in a 1965 engineers report. N\u00f8reg\u00e5rd\u2019s urgent recommendations referred to several transformative road plans for the city, including S\u00f8ringen (The Lake Ring) \u2013 a 12-lane thoroughfare first proposed in 1958, that would slice across Copenhagen\u2019s core and pave over its iconic lakes in the name of urban progression.  Alongside the road building blueprints was the City Vest (City West) plan to raze the Vesterbro neighbourhood \u2013 then deemed a ghetto \u2013 to make way for motorways and high-rise developments. Both proposals were part of the broader 1948 Finger Plan, drawn up as a long-term vision for the Greater Copenhagen area, which would see urban development concentrated alongside a new network of arterial roads and railways located along five \u201cfingers\u201d.     The Danish newspaper Politiken opposed Copenhagen\u2019s urban development plans in the 1960s. Photograph: Copenhagen City Archive    But it didn\u2019t happen. Much to the modernists\u2019 discontent at the time, Copenhagen\u2019s development took a different trajectory, and managed to escape the congested concrete clutches of modern urban planning. In the process, it laid the foundations for its contemporary reputation as one of the world\u2019s most \u201cliveable\u201d cities \u2013 an urban model so desirable that copying its outcomes even has its own verb: \u201cto Copenhagenise\u201d. \u201cWe were lucky that Copenhagen was poor after the second world war,\u201d Elle says. Rather than intelligent foresight, or a difference in the mindset of those in power, he suggests the Danish capital\u2019s avoidance of major carriageways is down to good fortune. \u201cWe thought we were unlucky and very poor. We were actually lucky, but still very poor.\u201d Copenhagen\u2019s lack of funds led to the city\u2019s modernist visions progressing at a painfully slow pace. It did get a small taste of a car-oriented future in the shape of the six-lane Bispeengbuen expressway, which rips through its northern neighbourhoods directly in front of second-storey windows.  \u201cThat was a real eye-opener. People could see that this would change Copenhagen \u2013 that this is what the plans mean,\u201d Elle says. \u201cInside people\u2019s heads, they found out that they were not happy with these [modernist developments]. By the 70s, they could experience how it was to live in it \u2026 you have to feel it in your body to know it\u2019s not good.\u201d     The lakes of Copenhagen escaped concrete and motorways. Photograph: Original i K\u00f8benhavns Stadsarkiv/Copenhagen City Archives    People were taking notice of these changes to the urban fabric throughout Europe. Protest movements such as Homes Before Roads emerged in London; it attempted to limit the removal of housing in the capital to make space for motorways. But perhaps the key element that set Copenhagen\u2019s anti-motorway protests apart was the fact they also demonstrated that an alternative future was possible.    One group was pushing cars out of the city whilst others were trying to push them in  Jan Gehl     \u201cWe had the notion that common space could pull people out of isolation,\u201d says Jan Gehl, renowned urban planner and godfather of the liveable cities movement. \u201cThere were these big freeway people, and then there were the counter streams that happened between 1960 and 1970 ... One group was pushing cars out of the city, while others were trying to push them in.\u201d Sitting in the bright top-floor offices of Gehl Architects in Vesterbro, the 79-year-old gestures to his surroundings: \u201cThis building wouldn\u2019t be here. The motorway would\u2019ve gone straight through it.\u201d As a young architect at the time of these plans, Gehl says many of his Copenhagen peers were working on \u201chumane city planning\u201d policies, after the pressure began to build at a citizen level: \u201cA discussion was beginning about the virtues of having a city for people \u2026 There was an environmental group, which started to put floats out in the lakes to show how far the motorway would extend. A big hotel was going to be built, so they winched up weather balloons to show how high it was going to be.\u201d     Vesterbro faced the wrecking ball in the 1960s, but survived to become one of Copenhagen\u2019s most popular districts. Photograph: Ty Stange/Copenhagen Media Center    In 1968, Denmark\u2019s primary newspaper Politiken switched its view from support to opposition of S\u00f8ringen and the City Vest plans, mirroring the mood in Copenhagen at the time. In a city that was getting poorer and poorer, road projects could not happen without state support \u2013 and that was revoked in 1972. The scrapping of plans once and for all coincided with the 1973 global oil crisis, which saw car use almost dry up in the city. It helped to shake the dust off the cycling culture and pedestrian movement, both of which have been on the rise ever since.    The dystopian outcomes of designing cities for cars can be seen in the likes of Stockholm and Birmingham    Five decades on, Copenhagen continues to retain its historic housing stock, strong bicycle culture and extensive pedestrianised zone \u2013 an urban model that many cities around the world are now desperately trying to claw back. The 6km lake shores are teeming with human activity, its frozen waters providing temporary public space during the winter months. And it is impossible to imagine how the 36,000 cyclists who currently use the N\u00f8rrebrogade lake crossing \u2013 Europe\u2019s most popular cycling street \u2013 would have got past a roaring 12-lane barricade, which would have left many now-thriving areas resembling the hinterland surrounding London\u2019s Westway. Vesterbro, the area that faced the wrecking ball under the plans, now stands as one of the city\u2019s most popular neighbourhoods. Across Copenhagen, dense, low-rise blocks front on to shop-lined streets, upon which 50% of the population travels by bicycle on a 390km network of cycle tracks.     Copenhagen has a thriving cycling culture, with 5.2 bikes for every car in the city. Photograph: Bruce yuanyue Bi/Alamy    Research on global transport released in 2015 found that building new roads (pdf) does little more than breed more cars, increase traffic and impact residents\u2019 health and wellbeing. The dystopian outcomes of designing cities for cars can be seen in the likes of Stockholm and Birmingham. \u201cYou might think you want to build a ring road to get the cars off the streets in the city,\u201d Elle says, \u201cbut if you really want to get the cars off the streets, you can just close the roads. It\u2019s a classic transport planning mistake to want more capacity.\u201d This sentiment is echoed by Gehl: \u201cWhat we have been able to prove is that a strong culture of using public spaces and bicycle facilities has developed here; [the opposite of] other cities that have a strong culture around using cars \u2026 It just depends on what you invite in.\u201d Cities are racing to catch up with what this different way of thinking has brought to Copenhagen\u2019s streets \u2013 but while they may seek to copy the city\u2019s road layouts, bicycle lanes and gleaming public spaces, it isn\u2019t that simple. \u201cI was always more interested in changing the mindset \u2013 then someone else can change the actual city,\u201d Gehl says. \u201cIn this firm, we don\u2019t do design \u2013 we do programmes and strategies for cities.\u201d Next stop for Gehl is Moscow, where he is returning to check up on a number of public space projects that began in 2011. He talks of the \u201cefficient democracy\u201d that allows leaders to implement changes almost overnight in places such as Russia and America \u2013 removing on-street parking, widening pavements and creating public squares: \u201cIf the mayor says \u2018car parking must go\u2019, you come back two weeks later and it\u2019s gone.\u201d To fully progress beyond the paradigm of car-centric planning, however, many of Copenhagen\u2019s experts say there is still much work to be done \u2013 such as the decoupling of economic success from road building. \u201cWhen the plans failed, some at the time might have said, \u2018We\u2019re not able to grow the economy\u2019 \u2013 but the lesson learned from that was that you don\u2019t need new roads to do that,\u201d says Mike Axon, who is leading the Create project, which is investigating the deeper barriers to changing our planning methodologies. \u201cThere are other ways around the problem \u2026 [our report] might find that road building is not a reasonable proxy \u2026 It\u2019s not the panacea.\u201d   Related: Story of cities #37: how radical ideas turned Curitiba into Brazil's 'green capital'    Citizen-focused planning is still at the heart of Copenhagen\u2019s future visions: \u201cWe are investing in sustainable solutions, and want to use the city as a laboratory for testing new technologies,\u201d says its lord mayor Frank Jensen, who is currently increasing bike infrastructure and extending the metro by 17 stations. \u201cBut the philosophy behind all the development in the city comes down to the question of liveability.\u201d In true Copenhagen fashion, the underbelly of Bispeenbuen flyover \u2013 the leftover trace of the city\u2019s modernist fantasies \u2013 is now the site of a new public space competition trying to bring life back to the concrete wasteland. But the city is also bowing to the pressure of a desire for economic growth and prosperity. The old principle of reducing car parking in the centre year on year is being reversed, and Copenhagen has also flirted with the idea of constructing a 27bn kroner (\u00a32.8bn) tunnel beneath its harbour. But Gehl\u2019s optimism is undimmed \u2013 based not just on his home city, but from his work with more than 100 others around the world: \u201cThere has really been a change in paradigm; now cities really want to be liveable, healthy and sustainable. This is really global now.\u201d Does your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development? Please share it in the comments below or on Twitter using #storyofcities",
