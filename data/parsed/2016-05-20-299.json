Research published earlier this year from the National Audit Office \u2013 which reported missed recruitment targets and more teachers leaving the profession \u2013 made for sober reading. Significant attention and resource has been focused on recruiting new teachers \u2013 with the government spending \u00a3700m every year on training. But less action has been taken to retain the growing number of teachers who are leaving the profession or seeking early retirement. Now, the retention crisis is presenting pipeline problems as schools increasingly struggle to recruit senior leaders. In a 2015 survey from the National Governor\u2019s Association, 43% of 4,383 respondents reported it was difficult to find high-quality candidates when recruiting senior staff.    Related: The secret recipe for high-performing schools? Listen to teachers    And it\u2019s no surprise that fewer teachers fancy heading up the career ladder. Alongside the long working hours and pressures of balancing classroom time with managerial responsibility, which many middle leaders face, the high-stakes accountability system can be a deterrent. There is also no longer a single defined training route for leadership. But in the midst of chaos there is always opportunity. Our live chat will discuss how schools can nurture leadership and encourage talented teachers to progress in the profession, rather than leaving it. Topics for discussion will include:  What\u2019s the best way to spot talent and hone the skills of able and ambitious colleagues?  What support is out there for those hoping to head into leadership? How can we help those who want to progress manage the pressures they face? How can you help junior colleagues to balance classroom work with professional development?  What lessons from their own development do senior teachers and educational experts have to share?  Ask questions and offer your advice, insight and ideas by joining us from 5.30-7.30pm on Wednesday 25 May 2015.  Our experts will be online during the time noted above, but comments are open now if you would like to post questions or suggestions in advance. You can also send questions for the panel by tweeting us @GuardianTeach or by emailing teacher.network@theguardian.com.
