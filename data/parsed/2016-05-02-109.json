  "body": "The Jungle Book, Jon Favreau\u2019s widely acclaimed CGI remake of the Rudyard Kipling classic, has defeated two new family films and a slew of other newcomers to keep hold of the US box-office crown for a third week running.    Related: The Jungle Book review \u2013 spectacular revival of Disney's family favourite    The film, which features the voices of Bill Murray, Christopher Walken and Ben Kingsley, added $42.4m to take its domestic total to $252m. It has currently made $684m worldwide.  This despite fresh competition from Ratchet & Clank and cat comedy Keanu, which landed at Nos 7 and 3 respectively.  The best-performing new release was Mother\u2019s Day, Garry Marshall\u2019s critically savaged ensemble movie, featuring Jennifer Aniston and Julia Roberts among some beleaguered mums. The film made $8.3m to come in fourth.  Remaining at No 2 despite an over 50% drop week on week was The Huntsman: Winter\u2019s War, the fantasy sequel starring Chris Hemsworth, Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron.  This Friday sees the release in the US of the latest Marvel movie, Captain America: Civil War, which now comes not only trumpeting terrific notices but also some very healthy international receipts.  The film opened in 37 countries last Friday and made over $200m. Given that it is not yet out in the US and China, among other key territories, the movie is well on course to equal the $1.4bn box office of last year\u2019s Avengers: Age of Ultron.",
