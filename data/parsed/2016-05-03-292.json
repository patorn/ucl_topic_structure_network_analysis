  "body": "Joe Casey, lead singer with Detroit post-punk band Protomartyr, recalls the band\u2019s recent European tour and he\u2019s somewhat consternated. \u201cThe first night in the UK, someone told me I looked like David Cameron,\u201d he grimaces. \u201cThe worst thing was I looked in the mirror and realised, \u2018Fuck, they\u2019re right\u2019.\u201d He pulls off his beanie and glasses: \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Ah \u2026 Casey, it\u2019s true, doesn\u2019t have the image of your average rock\u2019n\u2019roll star. None of Protomartyr do. Reviews have variously described them as resembling high school teachers, Belgian lorry drivers and \u2013 a reference to the fact the frontman, at 39, is a decade older than his bandmates \u2013 like \u201cthree scared teens who started a group with their alcoholic uncle\u201d. Yet, to see them live is to understand why none of that peripheral stuff matters. Protomartyr blow audiences away. Theirs isn\u2019t music which needs angular haircuts or well-tailored trousers. The songs stand alone; cerebral, angry, fierce; each one plotting a propulsive path between dystopian doom and life-affirming hope; a bit the Fall, a bit the Walkmen, a bit Pere Ubu.     Joe Casey: compared to an alcoholic uncle. Photograph: Waytao Shing/Getty Images for SXSW    And Casey himself? An onstage mix arrogance and anxiety, suited up but stock-still, almost always desperately clutching a beer. He couldn\u2019t come across less like an Old Etonian politician if he tried. He considers this assertion. \u201cGood answer,\u201d he declares, drily. We\u2019re talking ahead of Protomartyr\u2019s nine-date North American tour, starting on Wednesday in Guelph, Ontario. The four of them \u2013 that\u2019s Casey, along with guitarist Greg Ahee, bassist Scott Davidson and Alex Leonard on drums \u2013 are sipping Red Stripe in a bar garden. They\u2019re quiet of voice, thoughtful of answer and still, at 7pm, vaguely dishevelled from the night before. \u201cWe met a whisky ambassador,\u201d says Leonard, and that\u2019s all the explanation needed. They\u2019re not a band scared of sharing an opinion or two, as it goes. Over the course of a couple of hours, they\u2019ll rattle into Donald Trump, Detroit gentrification and why Jesse Hughes \u2013 the Eagles of Death Metal frontman whose band were on stage at the Paris Bataclan when terrorists burst in and murdered 89 people \u2013 is \u201ca fucking idiot\u201d. More of which shortly.            For now, Protomartyr\u2019s rise is worth recapping. Born and bred in Detroit, they remained in the city while their peers were fleeing its well-documented decline. At 32, Casey, a film studies graduate who had only ever worked dead-end jobs, decided there had to be more to life. He spoke to local musos Ahee and Leonard one drunken night, and \u2013 despite having no previous inclination towards music \u2013 found himself suggesting they form a band. Davidson joined shortly after. \u201cI knew I was starting old,\u201d nods Casey. \u201cBut the only difference that\u2019s made is we\u2019re more focused. We\u2019re aware we\u2019ve a limited window to achieve things. It makes us more urgent.\u201d Their first two albums \u2013 No Passion All Technique (2012), and Under Color of Official Right (2014) \u2013 won critical praise, before last year\u2019s The Agent Intellect edged towards commercial success. It reached No 3 on Billboard\u2019s Heatseekers Albums Chart for up-and-coming music, while newspapers and magazines almost uniformly named it in their best-of-year lists. Reviews revelled in Casey\u2019s oblique lyrics (\u201cPeople always ask if I like poetry and I always feel I disappoint them when I say no,\u201d he says), as well as the music\u2019s sense of darkness and decay. Many drew a link between the sound and the hometown. \u201cPeople hear we\u2019re from Detroit and they assume this narrative that we grew up in an abandoned auto-factory and art was an outlet from our terrible lives,\u201d says Ahee. \u201cBut we\u2019re from the suburbs. We had nice childhoods. The decline just didn\u2019t really affect us. Maybe the city informs the music in the same way any place anyone grows up does \u2013 obviously there are lyrical references too \u2013 but this idea, \u2018Oh, they could only be a Detroit band\u2019? It\u2019s bullshit.\u201d Casey thinks about this. \u201cMaybe in a practical sense, because the rents are so cheap, it meant we could focus on our art without worrying about money.\u201d     Protomartyr: \u2018You\u2019re going to need a lot of fucking artists to gentrify Detroit.\u2019 Photograph: Zak Bratto    When inexpensive living costs attract artists in such a way, it often leads to gentrification. Might that happen in the Motor City? Leonard snorts. \u201cI read that in the broadsheets. All these hipsters saying, \u2018We want to be part of Detroit\u2019s resurgence.\u2019 What? Go fuck yourselves. Have they ever even been? You\u2019re going to need a lot of fucking artists to gentrify Detroit.\u201d In the same way they refuse to be pigeonholed by their location, Protomartyr are also at pains to deny being especially political. \u201cIf there was a revolution,\u201d says Casey, \u201cI\u2019d probably watch it on TV.\u201d Yet such apathy doesn\u2019t quite ring true. Tracks like Bad Advice, about corrupt former city mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, and Clandestine Time, a rumination on the disparity of New York\u2019s rich and poor, suggest a certain level of engagement. \u201cWell,\u201d says Casey, \u201cthere\u2019s enough bands writing songs about eating pizza and getting drunk \u2013 no one needs us doing that too. I just figured if we\u2019re taking the time to write a song, it might as well say something.\u201d In person too, they don\u2019t shy away from controversial subjects. Gun control comes up. Casey owns a couple of rifles. \u201cAmerica is a country with bloodlust,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cAnd, if anything, it\u2019s getting worse \u2013 it\u2019s turning back to the Wild West. There needs to be more regulation. But it\u2019s also right people should own guns if they want.\u201d We also discuss November\u2019s Paris terrorist attacks and Jesse Hughes\u2019s suggestion that, if his audience in the Bataclan had been armed, fewer people might have died. \u201cI feel bad for what he went through, but the guy\u2019s a fucking idiot,\u201d says Ahee. \u201cHe\u2019s said a lot of Republican shit down the years and, whatever you think about guns, that\u2019s just a ridiculous argument.\u201d Talking of Republicans \u2026 \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d says Ahee again. \u201cTerrifying. He says what he thinks will go down well and it\u2019s working. And the fact there are so many people in America with these racist, border-line psychotic beliefs \u2013 fuck me, that\u2019s scary.\u201d They say they\u2019ll vote Hillary Clinton but reckon she\u2019s part of the problem. \u201cThe Democrats didn\u2019t want an open primary contest \u2013 they didn\u2019t want Bernie [Sanders] there \u2013 and they basically stitched it up so she would be the candidate,\u201d says Casey. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what makes people angry. These parties aren\u2019t listening.\u201d Ahee nods. \u201cMaybe there would be a positive if Trump was elected. Maybe it would give America a kick up the ass. Like, \u2018Holy shit, what did we just do?\u2019 Maybe then the parties would take notice of people. Or maybe a viable third candidate would emerge. I\u2019d like that.\u201d Until then \u2013 or until the televised revolution \u2013 Protomartyr will continue plotting their own steady course. They\u2019ll tour both Europe and North America again later this year, and have pencilled in album No 4 for 2017. After that, their ambitions stretch to no more than wanting to tour Asia and Australia. \u201cWhen we started, all we really wanted was to play around Detroit,\u201d says Casey. \u201cGetting to the other side of the world, that would be such a big deal. If we achieve that, I think we\u2019ll be pretty happy.\u201d",
