  "body": "Michelle Magorian paints a very sensitive picture of love, hatred and loss in Goodnight Mr Tom.  This book unveils the hidden potential behind the dynamic main character William Beech.  Through his exposure to different environments after moving into a foster home with Mr. Tom during the second world war, the main character dramatically transforms from \u201cSilly Sissie Willie\u201d to Will.  As the story unfolds, the newly transformed character realises that Mr Tom seems like a very hard man from outside but from inside he has a soft heart.          The book is very heart melting and conveys a very strong message of change. This novel will inspire and engage all ages.
