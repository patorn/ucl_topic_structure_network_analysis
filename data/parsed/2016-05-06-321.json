  "body": "\u201cSo what\u2019s your field, postcolonial literature?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been asked several times recently. I\u2019m actually a recent PhD graduate in English and Russian literature, specialising in Vladimir Nabokov \u2013 and, like the majority of PhD graduates, I\u2019m in the middle of the tricky task of trying to find an academic job.  I am also Asian. I never really thought my background had any bearing on what I want to do, but there have been numerous subtle moments in my academic life that have made me question the assumptions that are made about me.  People seem surprised to find that I\u2019m not a scholar of postcolonial literature. The reaction is never malicious, but it has made me feel like an outsider for the first time in my life.  One well-meaning academic spent a long time advising me that it might be a better idea to write about literature from my own cultural background. Another said that I should apply for a job teaching postcolonial studies because I\u2019d be in with a good chance. I replied that, although I may be \u201cpostcolonial\u201d, I\u2019m not qualified to teach it.  I do have a great deal of admiration for postcolonial studies, but it isn\u2019t my speciality. And given that I\u2019m a second-generation immigrant, with little knowledge of my parents\u2019 culture and no knowledge of their language, I found the suggestion troubling. I was born in Sri Lanka. My father, a lawyer who fought against police corruption, was forced to flee with his young family in 1990. I came to Scotland at the age of 4 and grew up in modest circumstances in Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh. My father is Catholic and my mother is Buddhist, but I didn\u2019t have a religious upbringing. I was raised among almost exclusively working-class Scottish kids from Irish Catholic backgrounds. A good friend of mine once joked to me that I had \u201cpretty much grown up white\u201d. I laughed it off, but felt uncomfortable. I know that the few incidents of racism which I encountered in my life are negligible compared to the experience of others. But nothing can change the fact that they occurred, even if in many ways my upbringing was typical.I was not comfortable with the idea that, just because I did the things that any typical Scottish kid would do, my experience was simply \u201cwhite\u201d. A preference for The Jesus and Mary Chain and Lou Reed over hip-hop or bhangra doesn\u2019t change that fact that I\u2019m not white. And I am experiencing similar feelings now when people are surprised to discover that I specialise in Nabokov and Wyndham Lewis, not Arundhati Roy or Chinua Achebe. It has been said that the sons and daughters of immigrants become doctors, lawyers and accountants so that their children can someday become artists, poets and scholars. My parents probably thought I was jumping the gun when I told them that I wanted to study literature instead of a profession. Their reaction? \u201cHow will you get a job?\u201d I was headstrong and stubborn, but I don\u2019t regret my decision. It\u2019s no question that less people from ethnic minority backgrounds choose not to study these subjects. But understanding the reasons for this is important. A cursory look at the teaching staff of any British humanities department will most likely reveal a lack (or complete absence) of people from ethnic minorities. Those that do appear \u2013 particularly in English literature departments \u2013 will almost inevitably specialise in postcolonial studies. These are important subjects, and I don\u2019t believe that such a situation is intentional, but the inevitable impression given is that these appointments are somehow tokenistic.  The whiteness of university humanities departments wasn\u2019t too much of a shock to me \u2013 my friends and teachers were all white. But others from ethnic minority communities, who may have aspirations different to those of their parents, may be discouraged from pursuing their ambitions. This issue is relevant to our wider political situation, where more discussions about cohesion and integration are frequent. It is understandably sensitive \u2013 how can a supposedly liberal and cosmopolitan intelligentsia, who strive to improve society with education and ideas, really speak with any authority and conviction if people from minority communities are so underrepresented within its ranks? When they are \u2013 or at least appear to be \u2013 restricted in their ambitions and aspirations? I\u2019ve never had much reason to feel marginalised in my life, but if the measure of a successful society can be judged by the quality of its education and cultural output, then perhaps we need to do more to encourage all peoples within that society to contribute equally and on the same terms.
