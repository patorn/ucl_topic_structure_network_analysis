  "body": "It was either a rare diversion from the fairytale script or totally fitting that the Leicester players celebrated unlikely sporting triumph not in a sweaty man mountain after the final whistle in front of a home crowd, but in Jamie Vardy\u2019s kitchen. Sure, history was being made in London, where Chelsea\u2019s late equaliser against Tottenham handed the Premier League title to Leicester \u2013 but it was being recorded in Melton Mowbray, where defender Wes Morgan was being dragged by a teammate over the floor tiles, his head briefly colliding with Vardy\u2019s dog basket. So it was, not for the first time, that the most domestic setting bore witness to a momentous event, confirming the modern kitchen\u2019s pivotal place in the home, where friends and family gather, big stuff happens and guards are dropped.

Would we have fussed so much had we learned that Ed Miliband had two sitting rooms rather than two kitchens, or worried as much had one of them not looked so spartan? Home is where the hearth is, and, if you\u2019re doing well, your hearth is a massive Aga. But whatever the size of the oven, the gleam of the surfaces or the lighting (Vardy\u2019s chandelier is quite something) kitchens are windows to more than just personal finances. The serial US presidential candidate and consumer champion Ralph Nader was dismissed by many on the right as a one-dimensional leftist until his mother, Rose Nader, wrote It Happened in the Kitchen, a cookbook cum memoir that revealed her son\u2019s family values.

Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Imag    In a similar spirit, Cameron was quick to capitalise on the Miliband kitchen-saga debate by embracing his own as family havens. \u201cThe kitchen is where you spend all your time,\u201d he said, the week before he chose his Oxfordshire kitchen as the setting for his interview. \u201cIt needs a sofa you can slump on, a table you can sit at, a kitchen you can cook in, a place children can do their homework \u2026 there has always been a kitchen at the heart of everything.\u201d Until you start doing really, really well, that is. When Cristiano Ronaldo posted a video tour of his Madrid mansion on Twitter last December, he went nowhere near any kitchen. \u201cMy chefs cook unbelievable [food] for me,\u201d he said while sitting at his vast glass dining table. It wasn\u2019t clear from the Vardy video how much cooking goes on in his kitchen \u2013 or who does it. Maybe he can swap notes with Ronaldo next season in the Champions League.",
