  "body": "Harper is a girl who lives in an apartment block and has an unusual talent. I suppose you would think a talented person is a famous actor or actress, or a dancer or a gymnast and all those snappy usual and attractive talents which you would think of straight away. Well, Harper\u2019s talent is that she can play any instrument without even learning a single note! One day Harper\u2019s beloved best friend, her cat Midnight, disappears and so do all the other cats in the town. Harper tries playing Midnight\u2019s favourite tune but even this doesn\u2019t bring her cat back. Harper knows she must team up with her friends, the other children in her apartment block, to find out what happened to the missing cats. Did they get lost? Had they been stolen? Had they moved out? Can the children solve the mystery with the help of the flying scarlet umbrella? Read this book to find out!      I really enjoyed this wonderful adventure book by Cerrie Burnell. The illustrations by Laura Ellen Anderson are fabulous and brilliant. I think this story would be exciting for 7-12 year olds.
