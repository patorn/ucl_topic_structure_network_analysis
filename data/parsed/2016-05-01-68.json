  "body": "Not the best preparation for Real Madrid, nor the best message to Manchester United. This was as comfortable a match for Southampton as it was a wretched one for Manchester City, depleted and disconnected while Sadio Man\u00e9 tore them to shreds. Man\u00e9\u2019s hat-trick capped a rampant display from Saints and, while Manuel Pellegrini can rightly argue about being hung out to dry by the Premier League schedule, this result will hardly immerse his squad in confidence before a daunting European semi-final in the Spanish capital on Wednesday. \u201cAre you watching, Real Madrid?\u201d chanted the City fans ironically once Man\u00e9 had completed his hat-trick, with Shane Long having given Southampton the lead and Dusan Tadic orchestrating things beautifully in midfield. Kelechi Iheanacho was the only City player to emerge with any pride, scoring one goal before half-time and a stunning late consolation. The result meant City finished the day four points above Manchester United, having played a game more, and with their rivals having three matches left to play after their earlier draw against Leicester. Louis van Gaal had conceded some ground in the battle for a top-four place after his side\u2019s match, but this performance means the race is not quite over yet. For City, only three players who started here also did in the midweek first leg against Real Madrid, which ended goalless. Joe Hart, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Fernandinho remained, and this unrecognisable side were sliced through with ease on numerous occasions. There were too often gaping spaces for Southampton to exploit in wide areas, with Pablo Zabaleta and \u2013 in particular \u2013 Aleksandar Kolarov regularly abandoning their defensive duties. Tadic caused major problems yet it was Man\u00e9 who walked away with the match ball. It was his second Premier League hat-trick \u2013 his first being the quickest in history, last season \u2013 and it propelled Ronald Koeman\u2019s side above Liverpool into seventh. Of Man\u00e9, the Southampton manager said: \u201cHe is still a young player and sometimes they need to be more consistent and that is why we train and work with all the players. A bit unpredictable but he was focused and clinical. That was one of my critics to all the strikers but we are very productive at home with more chances to score more. \u201cYou can talk about the changes of Manchester City but that is not fair. Give all the credit to Southampton because the performance was fantastic. \u201cFrom the start we caused them a lot of problems with the movement of Sadio and Shane [Long]. Dusan and [Steven] Davis were fantastic.\u201d Fraser Forster had palmed away a Raheem Sterling shot after Iheanacho had outmanoeuvred Virgil van Dijk on the touchline but Southampton were into their stride early on and within eight minutes of that chance for Sterling, City were two down and blue shirts in defence wore vacant stares. The Saints right-back, Cuco Martina, lofted a ball through for Tadic in the 25th minute and, with the Serb flying at pace, he deftly lifted it across goal with a single touch of the left foot and Long prodded past Hart. Seconds later City were cut apart again. Once more the opportunity arose from a lack of cohesion down City\u2019s left, Victor Wanyama breaking up play in midfield and feeding Tadic, who advanced and slipped a precise ball between Kolarov and Eliaquim Mangala to Man\u00e9, who emphatically finished past Hart. Iheanacho clawed City back into the match before half-time and the 19-year-old was the only City player injecting a sense of urgency into their play. In the 44th minute he fed Samir Nasri out wide right and headed the resulting ball in past Forster following a ricochet off Martina at the far post. Pellegrini was impressed by Iheanacho but admitted it was unlikely the youngster would force his way into the side for the Real game. \u201cWe start thinking tomorrow about what will be the starting XI for Wednesday,\u201d said the City manager. \u201cKelechi today scored two goals and is doing well in all the games but for the moment I am not thinking about that.\u201d In the 57th minute Southampton had a third. Davis whipped in a corner and, although Van Dijk\u2019s header was tipped excellently on to the bar by Hart, the rebound hit the turf and fell to Man\u00e9 at the far post who swept home. The Senegalese attacker completed his hat-trick in the 68th minute. Van Dijk outmuscled Iheanacho in midfield and Tadic fed Man\u00e9 on the counterattack, with the finish once again assured. There was still time for a pearler from Iheanacho on the edge of the Southampton penalty area, but as the home fans sang: \u201cGareth Bale, he\u2019s coming for you,\u201d Manchester City\u2019s heads dropped and hope faded. Man of the match Sadio Man\u00e9 (Southampton)",
