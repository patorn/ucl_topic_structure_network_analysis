  "body": "The TV Baftas is the only awards ceremony where the atmosphere pivots between \u201cicy family Christmas meal\u201d and \u201calarming geopolitical moment\u201d. This tense, comic dynamic is a result of divergent celebrity microcultures being forced to rub shoulders with each other. It\u2019s where Mark Rylance was probably forced to utter the sentence: \u201cSo, erm, what have you got coming up next?\u201d to Towie\u2019s Mark Wright, as they stared awkwardly at the floor in the queue for the urinals. Which, obviously, also makes for interesting trends on the red carpet. Man buns and beards     Aidan Turner\u2019s wins for best supporting man-bun. Photograph: Bafta    The man bun\u2019s race to the middle continued last night. Both Poldark\u2019s Aidan Turner and Leigh \u201cKeith Lemon\u201d Francis paired a bushy beard with a pulled-back bun. This was the definitive look for the award ceremony habitu\u00e9 who wanted to look like they would rather be at a life drawing evening class. It was further proof that the man bun was 2016\u2019s short back and sides. Big jewellery     Idris Elba\u2019s pinky ring and Naiyana Garth. Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images    Idris Elba went for a classic tux last night, save for one special sartorial flourish: the pinky ring. Less Dr Evil and more DeNiro in Goodfellas, Idris\u2019s wearing of the ring comes hot on the heels of Justin Timberlake\u2019s video for Can\u2019t Stop This Feeling, where JT wears paired a gold ring with a big, blinging gold watch. Could the Fitbit be on its way out and making way for the return of statement men\u2019s jewellery?  Bow ties of all sizes     Mark Rylance\u2019s diamond ended bow tie. Photograph: Julian Parker/Getty Images    The bow-tie came in all shapes and sizes at the Baftas: Mark Rylance\u2019s was diamond-ended, Fred Sirieix\u2019s was a mass of velvet but Jon Snow\u2019s was the best: black netting intermeshed with sequins. It signified that the bow tie is a safe space for male fashion expression on the red carpet.  Mankles and loafers     Luke Pasqualino went for the loafer with bare ankle. Photograph: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images    Although most opted for the smart black shoe option, Luke Pasqualino went for 2016\u2019s smartest power-dressing move: the loafer with the bare ankle. It\u2019s both a sensible summer shoe and puts a new spin on the staid black tie look. Quilted jacket     Peter Kosminsky shows off his quilted jacket. Oh, and his Bafta. Photograph: Ian West/PA    Hero of the evening was Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky who Lemonaded the BBC in his speech. Meanwhile his oversize, quilted black jacket with a Nehru collar, with it hints of the athleisure trend, should have got a standing ovation all of its own.",
