  "body": "Amir Khan has nowhere left to travel in boxing but down a lonely avenue of pain that might end in a place called retribution, even if he would be handsomely recompensed to absorb further shocks to his body at the end of a long and tough career. The Bolton boxer has one or maybe a handful of fights left after the knockout that Sa\u00fal \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez delivered to him in the sixth round here on Saturday night, more emphatically than he had dispatched any of his previous 48 opponents. And there was one candidate immediately happy to accommodate Khan when he recovers: Sheffield\u2019s Kell Brook. Khan, 29, a former world champion at two weights, said before this fight he would not retire until he wins another title, and the unbeaten Brook brings his IBF belt for what would be a major boxing event in a British football stadium \u2013 perhaps Wembley but just as likely Manchester, nearer to their northern homes. However, they have a deep and long-running animus to settle first. It is a very tough fight to make when it should not be. Fighters who do not like each other are usually desperate to share a ring. Khan in his hotel suite on Sunday was upbeat and defiant, wearing a slight nick under his right eye but probably bearing deeper scars. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m safe and in good health,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hurt \u2013 that shot would hurt a lot of people. But I can come back for more big fights. I\u2019m still the mandatory challenger for Danny Garc\u00eda\u2019s WBC welterweight title and will move back down. I\u2019d like to fight in the UK next, maybe in December.\u201d He revealed also that \u00c1lvarez outweighed him by 23lbs by the time they got in the ring, having each scaled 155lbs at Friday afternoon\u2019s weigh-in. \u201cI walked into the ring at around 162lb and he was a lot heavier, near to 185. He wasn\u2019t hurt when I hit him. I didn\u2019t expect him to be that big and I\u2019ve never really been hit that hard before. I stepped up too far and took something I shouldn\u2019t have taken, but I\u2019m in the peak of my career. \u201cEverything was going fine until that one big punch. I\u2019ve still got a lot left in me and I\u2019m not going to blame anyone because I took the fight. I knew what I was going into. I\u2019ve been knocked out before and always come back stronger. I\u2019ll do that again.\u201d As for his recollection of the experience, he said: \u201cI remember going back to my corner after I\u2019d stood up and then went to do the interview in the ring. I didn\u2019t see the punch coming \u2013 I would have tried to avoid it if I did! He put everything into the shot and it must have been the hardest punch he\u2019s landed for a long, long time.\u201d It looks increasingly likely Khan\u2019s next opponent will be the undefeated Philadelphian Garc\u00eda, who provides the added lure of revenge, as Khan is the mandatory challenger for the WBC belt he ripped away from him in this town four years ago. That fight would be in Las Vegas, probably in September. Khan says a quick overnight examination in hospital cleared fears of concussion \u2013 which is quite something. But, medical science and his own resilience aside, Khan has cause to wonder how much more his vulnerable chin and outsized heart can take in this sport. As the promoter Oscar De La Hoya said: \u201cAmir Khan is one of the bravest fighters on the planet. He didn\u2019t lose anything today. He will come back.\u201d But only a former fighter now earning his living on the safe side of the ropes could so easily juxtapose concern and business acumen. De La Hoya had rightly identified the quality of Khan\u2019s doomed challenge, coming up from welterweight and now heading straight back there \u2013 even if two of the judges absurdly had \u00c1lvarez ahead going into the sixth round, ignoring the challenger\u2019s superb boxing for most of the early exchanges. Nonetheless \u00c1lvarez was getting to Khan and the one-punch finish almost certainly saved him from an extended and more damaging beating. Meanwhile there is more money for everyone to make in the future and Khan will not blanch at the prospect of adding to the base $2m (\u00a31.4m) purse plus extras he earned this weekend. Nor will those well placed to help him get a little richer but probably not much healthier. Within minutes of Khan\u2019s head thudding with alarming force on to the canvas, his legs twitching in mute acknowledgment of the impact of the brilliant, long right hand that had crashed into his slack jaw, Brook was on Twitter to reissue a challenge for a domestic fight that could rival that between Carl Froch and George Groves in front of 80,000 people at Wembley Stadium two years ago.

Now the options are shrinking. \u201cI\u2019m here [for] all British showdown\u201d was Brook\u2019s simple message. Garc\u00eda, meanwhile, was as shocked as anyone watching on TV or the 16,000 customers at ringside in the new T-Mobile Arena: \u201cOmg. I feel bad for khan. Wow.\u201d Garc\u00eda will put those concerns for Khan\u2019s health to one side, however, when De La Hoya or Al Haymon, Khan\u2019s influential American adviser, calls him this week to talk numbers. The only hindrance to that long-awaited and mandated rematch is the prospect of a comeback by Floyd Mayweather Jr. As only he has the shameless knack of doing, the supposedly retired king of boxing has been insinuating himself into other people\u2019s narratives for the past couple of weeks, hinting at a return against Garc\u00eda in September. If he did steal that fight from Khan \u2013 having twice reneged on offers to meet him in the past \u2013 it would not surprise. But Khan seems unperturbed. He knows the WBC would then strip Brook of the title and hand him the opportunity to claim or contest it. But what of the winner of Saturday night\u2019s epic? The likelihood of boxing fans finally getting the fight they want more than any other \u2013 \u00c1lvarez against Gennady Golovkin to unify, ludicrously, five strands of the middleweight title \u2013 is turning from shale to concrete, because Mexico would be appalled if their hero found a way to avoid the sport\u2019s most dangerous fighter. Golovkin said last week he would not fight \u00c1lvarez at a catchweight below 160lb, as Khan did on Saturday night, at 155lb, and the Mexican had previously asserted he was reluctant to take on the bigger man at his own best weight. That argument seems to be shifting. \u201cThere are not going to be any weight issues with Golovkin,\u201d \u00c1lvarez said. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to my team and we will make him an offer. I\u2019ll fight him at 160. I would like to fight in Mexico this year, or some time next year. Now we\u2019re going to sit down and discuss it. If we fight, it\u2019s not just for the fans, or because it is mandated. We\u2019re going to fight because we want to.\u201d De La Hoya was equally adamant that \u00c1lvarez-Golovkin is the only fight he is pursuing. There certainly was no mention of Britain\u2019s Billy Joe Saunders, who holds the WBO title. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to any other fighter \u2013 just Triple G, correct,\u201d he said when asked about alternative opponents. \u201cI have all his representatives on speed dial. If that\u2019s the fight that everyone wants, if that\u2019s the fight Canelo wants, I\u2019ll get some rest and start making some early-morning phone calls.\u201d According to the WBC, he has until 22 May to do a deal. Time and timing are everything in boxing.   Related: Why is Amir Khan appreciated more abroad than at home? | Madhvi Pankhania",
