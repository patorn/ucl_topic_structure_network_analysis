  "body": "The father of a Sydney teenager accused of plotting a terrorist attack on Anzac Day has pled for his son to be released on bail, saying he \u201cwould do anything\u201d to get him home. The Parramatta children\u2019s court is hearing a bail application for the 16-year-old, who was arrested last week after allegedly trying to source a gun and an explosives manual.   Related: Police ran online sting against Sydney boy charged with Anzac Day terrorism plot    His father said on Monday he would ensure round-the-clock supervision of the teenager, lock up electronic devices in the house and even sleep in the same bed to monitor him. \u201cTo get my son back home I would do anything ... I love him with all my heart and he\u2019s everything to me,\u201d he said. He told his son, watching on via video link: \u201cI love you\u201d. Crown prosecutor Chris Choi alleged the boy had been planning the attack from at least 16 April, when he allegedly sent a text to someone saying: \u201cI want to learn how to make a bomb\u201d.   Related: Sydney teenager charged with Anzac Day terrorism plot pleads not guilty    She said he allegedly \u201ctook steps to obtain a gun and a bomb manual in order to commit a terrorist attack on Anzac Day\u201d. When asked why he chose 25 April, the teenager allegedly replied: \u201cBecause here in Australia the kafir (non-Muslims) celebrate Anzac Day and I want to terrorise them on the day\u201d, according to Choi. The boy\u2019s mother wept and buried her head on her husband\u2019s shoulder during the prosecutor\u2019s address.  He has been in custody since 24 April, when he was arrested by counter-terrorism police near his home in Sydney\u2019s west. Choi said the teenager, who cannot be named, first came under police investigation between 5 and 8 May last year. He was at that time referred to the national disruption group and agreed to undergo a de-radicalisation program to address \u201cviolent, extremist behaviours\u201d, a program which he was still on when arrested. \u201cThe prosecution\u2019s submission is, Your Honour, it (the program) hasn\u2019t worked in relation to this young person,\u201d Choi said. She said his alleged online communications had had a sense of urgency, and he had made handwritten declarations calling for shariah law. The court heard that his profile picture for a messaging application was a lion on the Islamic State flag and there was evidence on his phone that he\u2019d accessed recruitment videos and other Islamic State propaganda. Choi said there was a serious risk the boy would fail to appear or endanger the safety of the public if he was granted bail. If he was released, she argued, he had a greater urgency to achieve \u201cwhat he failed to do\u201d on Anzac Day. The boy\u2019s lawyer, Zemarai Khatiz, has argued he should be granted bail because his age and youth meant there were exceptional circumstances in place. Last week Khatiz submitted a list of strict potential bail conditions, including a condition the boy would wear an ankle bracelet if released. Khatiz also said the boy\u2019s family was willing to use its $1.2m home as security if the teenager was granted bail. Lawyers for the teenager had tried to have media excluded from the bail hearing, arguing publicity around his arrest was \u201cadding to [his] psychological burden\u201d. The hearing continues.",
