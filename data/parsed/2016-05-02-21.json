  "body": "The young Somali woman who set herself alight on Nauru \u2013 the second refugee in a week to do so \u2013 has been taken to Australia by air ambulance, but her situation remains critical.   Related: Widow of refugee who set himself alight 'being kept in hotel and denied a lawyer'    Hodan, 21, doused herself and set herself alight inside the OPC1 section of the detention centre on Nauru. According to reports, she suffered severe burns to most of her body. One person reported \u201call of her clothes were burned off\u201d. Another source said: \u201cOne of the witnesses who saw her said the situation is much worse than Omid,\u201d a reference to 23-year-old Omid Masoumali, who died last week after self-immolating on Nauru. Other refugees were prevented by police from entering the hospital to see Hodan (spelled Hadon on her immigration department records) but said that she must be medically evacuated as quickly as possible after accusations of delays in treating Masoumali. An air ambulance arrived overnight on Nauru to transport Hodan to Australia. She arrived mid-morning in Brisbane. Sources on Nauru say she has suffered severe burns to her upper body and face. The incident will increase the pressure on the Australian government to improve conditions on Nauru and at its other offshore detention centre on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Despite Labor supporting the government\u2019s policy of refusing settlement for refugees arriving by illegal boats, the party\u2019s immigration spokesman Richard Marles said it was leaving people without hope. Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull \u201cmust urgently seek a viable agreement to resolve the fate of people on Manus Island and Nauru\u201d, Marles said on Tuesday. Hodan was forcibly returned to Nauru only last Wednesday. She was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident on Nauru last November, and was brought to Australia for medical treatment. In the early hours of the morning last Wednesday, Australian Border Force guards carried her out of the Brisbane immigration transit accommodation (Bita) holding her by her arms and legs as she screamed to be allowed to stay. Sources on the island say Hodan\u2019s self-immolation was her second attempt at suicide since being returned to the island. Hodan had been held on Nauru for three years before she was moved to Brisbane. Friends described her as a \u201cgentle soul\u201d who had been \u201cdestroyed\u201d by her time in detention. Masoumali set himself alight at Nibok refugee settlement on Nauru last Wednesday in the presence of representatives from the United Nations. Video footage shot on a mobile phone, which Guardian Australia has chosen not to publish, shows him dousing himself in accelerant and shouting: \u201cThis is how tired we are; this action will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it any more\u201d. He then sets himself alight. Masoumali\u2019s widow, also a refugee, has been critical of the delay in getting him care on Nauru. She says it was hours before he was given painkillers. It was more than 22 hours before he was taken to a Brisbane hospital. Video footage of Masoumali at Nauru hospital shows him clearly conscious as he paces up and down while screaming \u2013 with severe burns apparent to his arms, legs, chest and back \u2013 while distressed friends plead for him to be given assistance. A second clip shows doctors and nurses struggling to administer painkillers, as Omid, still standing, continues to scream. People watching nearby are vomiting.   Related: 'We are the forgotten people': the anguish of Australia's 'invisible' asylum seekers    Masoumali\u2019s widow told Guardian Australia her husband was not given a sheet or a place to lie down, and that the hospital \u201cdidn\u2019t even have a clean syringe\u201d. \u201cStaff in Nauru hospital couldn\u2019t help Omid in any way because they were unequipped,\u201d she said. \u201cA lack of proper equipment and facilities was the reason that staff couldn\u2019t help and treat Omid in the Nauru hospital.\u201d On Monday, she said she was being kept in a Brisbane hotel by immigration authorities, denied access to a lawyer and sedated. The Nauru government has said Masoumali received \u201cthe highest level of care\u201d. But Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said there was \u201can epidemic of self-harm at Nauru\u201d \u201cA vulnerable young woman who needed protection was a victim of a spiteful removal. She has been sent to the toxic environment that the minister has created on Nauru. Tragically this was entirely predictable.\u201d  Current Australian government policy \u2013 support by both major parties \u2013 mandates that no asylum seeker who arrives, or attempts to arrive, by boat will ever settle in the country. Instead they are sent to the two offshore processing facilities on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, or Nauru, ostensibly for processing, followed by repatriation or resettlement in a third country. However, in practice, it has resulted in indefinite detention, with fewer than five resettlements in Cambodia and PNG (Nauru does not offer permanent resettlement) from more than 2,000 people in detention. New Zealand has offered to take refugees, but Australia has refused this, saying it was a \u201cback door\u201d to entering Australia. Last week the PNG supreme court ruled the detention on Manus Island was illegal and unconstitutional, and its government announced closure of the Manus Island facility. Since then, the Australian government has been scrambling for a solution, and detainees in both centres have become increasingly distressed amid the confusion. The United Nations has said Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime is acutely damaging, and called for refugees and asylum seekers to be removed from their current detention. Catherine Stubberfield, spokesperson for UNHCR\u2019s regional representation in Canberra, said there was \u201cno doubt that the current policy of offshore processing and prolonged detention is immensely harmful\u201d. \u201cThere are approximately 2,000 very vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. These people have already been through a great deal, many have fled war and persecution, some have already suffered trauma. Despite commendable efforts by the governments of Papua New Guinea and Nauru, arrangements in both countries have proved completely untenable.\u201d Stubberfield said the mental health and physical wellbeing of people held in detention had deteriorated over time. \u201cThe consensus among medical experts is that conditions of detention and offshore processing do immense damage to physical and mental health. UNHCR\u2019s principal concern today is that these refugees and asylum seekers are immediately moved to humane conditions with adequate support and services to prevent further unnecessary suffering.\u201d The government of Nauru said it was \u201cdistressed that refugees are attempting such dreadful acts in order to attempt to influence the Australian government\u2019s immigration policies\u201d.

Recent events on both Manus and Nauru demonstrate the unsustainability of present arrangements, and that further serious and life-threatening incidents are inevitable.\u201d  In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.
