Corboy, who has a stock feed supply business, is hopeful and says the feedback has been positive. \u201cWithout sounding sexist, some people are rapt to have a man to vote for,\u201d Corboy said. The Nationals\u2019 campaign in Indi will step up a notch on Tuesday when the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, travels down to open Corboy\u2019s campaign office in Wangaratta \u2013 which sits right next door to McGowan\u2019s office. \u201cI am finding conservative voters appreciate having a choice \u2013 it gives Indi the chance to hit the reset button,\u201d Corboy said.   Related: Personal pushes aside policy in McGowan-Mirabella Indi election debate    The Nationals are campaigning hard to win the highly marginal seat in north-east Victoria, which McGowan holds by 0.3%. The Nationals and the Liberals will swap preferences in the seat to try to make McGowan a one-term member. Polling in March showed Mirabella trailing McGowan by 10 percentage points. But with Corboy coming third, a neat preference swap would put the sitting MP in danger of losing her seat.  Joyce will then take his \u201cwombat trail\u201d campaign tour to the seat of Murray \u2013 another three-cornered contest, with the Liberals after the retirement of the Liberal MP Sharman Stone. The Nationals are running the former Geelong footballer Damian Drum against the Liberal candidate, Duncan McGauchie, a former Victorian government adviser and the son of Donald McGauchie, a former chair of Telstra and former president of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation. The Nationals had held Murray until Stone won it in 1996.  Both seats are shaping up to be critical and may exert pressure on the Coalition partnership. It is understood that in Indi, Mirabella has appeared at National party campaign events.  McGowan\u2019s upset win was one of the surprises of the 2013 campaign, tipping out Mirabella, a shadow cabinet member and close ally of Tony Abbott. The former MP was a polarising member at time. The former New England independent Tony Windsor said she deserved the \u201cnasty prize\u201d when he retired in 2013.  Mirabella has since expressed her \u201cregrets\u201d being caught in \u201cthe Canberra bubble\u201d and not spending enough time in her electorate. Corboy told Guardian Australia the big issues in Indi included telecommunications, particularly mobile networks and the national broadband network rollout, jobs and infrastructure, as well as the collapse of the milk price, now the subject of a class action.  The dairy industry is reeling from a price drop from Murray Goulburn and Fonterra, which is backdated over farmers\u2019 annual supply contract, leaving them owing money.  Asked how the National party under Joyce would address the issue, Corboy said if anyone could get supplies and sellers together \u201cit would be Joyce\u201d.  McGowan said she was optimistic about her chances but expected a close race. As the dairy crisis developed, she called on the government to treat agriculture like defence \u2013 that is have a national strategy in place that could assist industries such as the dairy industry struggling with manufacturing. \u201cWith Murray Goulburn, the issue is not producing the milk, it is the issues around the manufacturing arm,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cDefence [and the submarine contract] is an example of what the government can do for a national industry when it puts its mind to it.\u201d McGowan said she was disappointed the budget contained no continuation of the blackspot funding program for mobile coverage and there was nothing for employment in the regions.

McGowan said the Indi community was also disappointed at the budget cuts to arts funding, with the Wangaratta jazz festival taking a \u201chuge cut\u201d.  Mirabella was contacted for comment.",
