  "body": "The French parliament has begun a heated debate of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s controversial shakeup of labour regulations as riot police stood guard over demonstrators in nearby streets. France has seen almost two months of regular mass street protests against the unpopular Socialist president\u2019s attempt to reshape the country\u2019s rigid labour laws. Just as the bill reached parliament for the first day of a debate scheduled to last for more than a week, hundreds of demonstrators continued their protests near parliament in Paris and in other cities. The labour reform bill \u2013 which sets out to loosen France\u2019s strict labour rules \u2013 is seen as the last major push for reform before the end of Hollande\u2019s presidency, but the protests and political infighting it has provoked could damage his chances of running for re-election next year.

The government has argued it needs to cut red tape and the more cumbersome rules that deter employers from hiring. But opponents, including trade unions and students, have said the plans betray the values of the left and are too pro-business. After weeks of protests, including by students, the government watered down its proposals. Now business leaders are saying the changes do not go far enough.            Protests in Paris against labour reforms    If rebel MPs within Hollande\u2019s own party stop the government gaining enough parliamentary support to vote through the law, the government could decide to push it through by decree, without a parliamentary vote. But this option \u2013 already used last year for an economic package \u2013 is politically extremely risky.  MPs have tabled more than 5,000 suggested amendments to the bill, which must now be dealt with in parliament.  \u201cWe love trade unions and we love business,\u201d the Socialist labour minister, Myriam El Khomri, told parliament as she fought to bring together the warring factions of her own party. Hollande\u2019s political future is hanging in the balance with a year to go until the 2017 presidential election. His four years in office have been mired in stalled growth and rampant unemployment. France\u2019s jobless rate is at an 18-year high of more than 10% \u2013 twice that of Germany. Youth unemployment stands stubbornly at about 24%. Hollande has promised he will not run for re-election unless he manages to stem the rise in unemployment. The new labour laws have been presented by the government as a major step for dealing with joblessness.

He is accused by some of betraying his party\u2019s core values and has seen his voter approval on the left shrink notably. Since 31 March, after nearly 400,000 people took to the streets, a new movement, Nuit debout, which loosely means \u201crise up at night\u201d, has occupied town squares, encompassing a range of causes and defined by disappointment at Hollande\u2019s presidency.  With a new day of mass protest scheduled for next week, police are braced for street clashes. Many of the demonstrations against the bill have turned violent.  Authorities said troublemakers \u2013 known as casseurs, or breakers \u2013 took advantage of the demonstrations to foment clashes with riot police. Demonstrators accused the police of heavy-handedness which they claimed was fuelling the violence.",
