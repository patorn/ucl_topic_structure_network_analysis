  "body": "Apologies for the late debrief this morning, I\u2019m just back at the computer after the formerly-known-as-Bupa-10km. Now known as the Vitality 10km, but I can\u2019t quite get my head around that. I\u2019d forgotten quite what a massive race it is \u2013 a huge field, starting more or less exactly where the London Marathon finishes, and looping around central London to St Paul\u2019s and back.  Theoretically \u2013 and certainly for other people \u2013 it\u2019s a fast course, though it never seems to work out that way for me. I made the mistake of starting too far back and spent the first two miles \u2013 a fair proportion of the race \u2013 trying to get past people. Then again, I\u2019m not sure my heart was really in a proper \u201cgo for a PB race\u201d, so perhaps I\u2019m just making excuses. I finished in a negative split, which has to be a first for a 10km race for me, and a nowhere-near-PB time that still, I reckon, just about qualifies as a hard training workout. I\u2019ve realised from previous summers of 10km races that I need a good run up at these things \u2013 starting with a good tempo run, building on that in a series of races through the summer. So let\u2019s call this a season opener \u2026 Not so for some of my club-mates, though \u2013 my congrats today go to my team-mates Nick and Julia, both of whom got PBs. The latter was going for her first sub-40 and didn\u2019t so much get it as zoom straight past it, scoffing in the general direction of 39 minutes, too, to finish in 38min 36sec. I am in awe.  So, did you race this weekend? Do you, like me, need a few run-ups at a decent 10km race or are you flying from the word go? (If so, can I borrow your legs?) As always, your triumphs, despair, advice and stories below the line. Wouldn\u2019t be Monday without them.",
