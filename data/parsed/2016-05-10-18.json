  "body": "Spain\u2019s first openly gay referee has walked away from the game, insisting he \u201ccannot take any more\u201d. Jes\u00fas Tomillero, who has been a referee from the age of the 11 and was working near the foot of the Spanish football pyramid in the Andaluc\u00edan regional league, took the decision after he was subjected to abuse following his decision to give a penalty during a match between Portuense and San Fernando Isle\u00f1o on Saturday.   Related: Turkish FA ordered to compensate referee who lost licence for being gay    Tomillero came out publicly last March as he presented a formal complaint against a kit man from Pe\u00f1a Madridista Linense in the under-19 league in Andaluc\u00eda, which resulted in a nine-game ban and a \u20ac30 fine. He told the newspaper El Espa\u00f1ol he has been subjected to abuse since and that last weekend he reached breaking point. Soon after Tomillero gave a penalty, he says someone from among the visiting supporters shouted: \u201cThat\u2019s that poof who was on the telly,\u201d adding, \u201cyou can stick the goal up your arse, you fucking poof\u201d. The referee said the worst thing was that \u201ceveryone in the crowd laughed\u201d. He communicated his decision to quit football to the Andaluc\u00edan football federation soon after. Support has come from local political parties in La L\u00ednea, near Gibraltar, and Tomillero says he has been backed by first division referees, but lamented that officials from the Andaluc\u00edan federation ignored him following his decision to come out publicly in March last year. He has presented a formal complaint about Saturday\u2019s events, with the hope stiffer action will be taken this time. Tomillero described it as \u201cabsolutely incredible\u201d that Pe\u00f1a Madridista Linense\u2019s kit man got only a nine-game ban when \u201cfootball is educating 14- and 15-year-olds\u201d. The matchday delegate from San Fernando will testify on his behalf this time but that will not return him to the field.",
