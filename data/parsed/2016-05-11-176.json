  "body": "David Cameron has said he will ask the culture secretary John Whittingdale to investigate an ITV drama based on the murder of a mother by her husband that has been made without her family\u2019s permission. The case of Lauren Bradford was raised during prime minister\u2019s questions by her MP, Labour\u2019s Louise Haigh, who said her constituent was powerless to stop the making of the show, which uses the real names of both her mother and the family. The Secret, starring James Nesbitt, recounts the story of Bradford\u2019s mother, who was initially thought to have committed suicide in 1991 before it was discovered in 2009 that she had in fact been murdered by her husband and his lover. Haigh said she had contacted ITV and regulator Ofcom, but \u201cas far as I can see no rules have been broken\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in this house can imagine the pain and suffering they have had to endure,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are having to relive this pain because ITV are dramatising the whole ordeal completely against their wishes, using not only the real names of her family but also her own.\u201d   Related: My family was traumatised first by a murder, then by the TV serialisation | Lauren Bradford    \u201cDoes the prime minister not agree victims should have a far greater role in any accounting of their story?\u201d Cameron said that he remembered occasions from his own time in the TV industry when \u201cdecisions are made that can cause a huge amount of hurt and upset to families\u201d and said he would ask Whittingdale what could be done about Bradford\u2019s case and any future instances.  Writing in the Guardian earlier this month, Bradford described the additional trauma created by the dramatisation: \u201cBehind the high viewing figures, whether for fiction or the coverage of real crimes, there are people living with murder-bereavement on a daily basis. And an intrusive media experience can often compound this original trauma.  \u201cIf deemed \u2018a good enough story\u2019, private grief becomes public property.\u201d An ITV spokeswoman said: \u201cITV has a proud record of broadcasting award-winning factual dramas, based on or representing real events and people. The scripts for The Secret were based on an exhaustively researched book by a highly respected journalist as well as extensive additional research and the documented court cases, which have been widely reported in the media. \u201cThe programme makers informed the families of the production, and gave them the opportunity to see the series prior to broadcast. We have never suggested that they approved or authorised the drama. We do believe that we have conducted the making and broadcast of this series responsibly, in seeking to minimise distress to family members, in so far as we were able to do so, given the subject matter.\u201d",
