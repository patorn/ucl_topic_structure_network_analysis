Over the past two days the place has been busy for the first time, thanks to the first people to fly from there. In January 2015 the Villarreal team boarded flight YW2003 bound for San Sebasti\u00e1n; on Wednesday they caught a charter heading for Liverpool John Lennon, where a metal Yellow Submarine awaited them. History awaits them too, and more than 2,000 supporters followed from Vila\u00a0Real, population 51,367. Three charter flights left Castell\u00f3n on Wednesday and six are scheduled for Thursday, more than normally take off there in a week. Others flew from Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid: fans, friends and family. Denis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s mother, a hairdresser, and his father, a car mechanic, came in from Galicia, north-west Spain. There are no direct flights but they were not going to miss seeing him in a European semi-final at Anfield. Nor was Su\u00e1rez\u2019s sister, Zulay, but at least she did not have to travel so far. She came by car.    For a Spaniard, saying no to Barcelona is very difficult \u2013 even if you\u2019re at City.  Denis Su\u00e1rez     Su\u00e1rez signed for Manchester City in 2011, aged 17. He left Celta Vigo, who he supports and had joined at 11, because they were in administration and needed the money. Barcelona wanted him too but, he admits with striking honesty, there were two fundamental reasons to choose England: one was financial, the other family. \u201cCelta had to sell and City paid them an important amount [\u20ac1.5m up front, \u20ac1.5m more upon his debut], while the contract sorted out my parents\u2019 lives,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd, above all, City let me take my family with me.\u201d After two years in Manchester he returned to Spain and so did his parents. They went back to Salceda de Caselas, the town of 8,835 people where he grew up; Su\u00e1rez went to Barcelona, then Sevilla, then Villarreal. Zulay, though, stayed in Manchester where she runs a company called Forever Fit and where, Su\u00e1rez says with a smile, \u201cshe\u2019d got herself an English boyfriend\u201d. A City fan, he and Zulay planned to watch Wednesday\u2019s Champions League semi\u2011final with Denis in the Villarreal team\u2019s hotel and Thursday\u2019s Europa League semi\u2011final in the Villarreal end. Had things turned out differently, they might have watched him weekly at the Etihad Stadium. He could be forgiven for thinking that, given the chance, he would be in City\u2019s first team now. \u201cYes, maybe. But I don\u2019t regret any of the decisions I\u2019ve made.\u201d He has made a lot of them, while others have been made for him, leaving him seemingly forever moving on. \u201cMaybe in different circumstances I\u2019d be playing for City or Barcelona, or if Celta hadn\u2019t had financial problems I\u2019d still be there,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cBut you have to keep progressing, and every experience makes you stronger.\u201d Su\u00e1rez speaks in a soft voice, his words considered and thoughtful, but the ambition is inescapable, the character too \u2013 visible, too, in how much he\u2019s experienced so young, in his refusal to allow progress to slow, the search for opportunity. At 22 he has had five clubs and more lies ahead. A call-up to Spain\u2019s preliminary pre-Euro squad is likely and with Barcelona intending to exercise their right to buy him back, so is another move.   Related: Liverpool\u2019s Daniel Sturridge made to wait by J\u00fcrgen Klopp on semi-final role    It has been quite a journey and it started with a goal. \u201cIt was against Los Angeles Galaxy in pre-season,\u201d Su\u00e1rez recalls. \u201cI came on late and it went to penalties. I hadn\u2019t got the ball, so my first ever touch as a City player was a penalty ... which I scored.\u201d If Su\u00e1rez remembers the penalty \u2013 \u201cacross my body, the keeper going the wrong way\u201d \u2013 most remember that game for Roberto Mancini furiously hauling off Mario Balotelli after an attempted backheel. Su\u00e1rez was behind him on the bench at the time. \u201cMario heard a whistle from the stands,\u201d Su\u00e1rez explains. \u201cBut Mancini hadn\u2019t heard it and substituted him because he thought he was messing about. If Balotelli had been focused, if his head had been right, he\u2019d have been a great player, I\u2019m certain. I saw him do things in training that were la leche [the business]. But there was no maliciousness in him, nothing bad at all: it was just the way he is. He was like a kid, everything was funny, but he was a good guy.\u201d Su\u00e1rez says they all were. And Balotelli, who spoke Spanish, was among those who helped most in the first difficult weeks, along with Pablo Zabaleta and Mancini\u2019s sons Felippo and Andrea. Su\u00e1rez had his family around him, built a relationship with team-mates and learnt English. He admits it was harder for his parents, for whom life in England was \u201cnothing like\u201d Spain even though City \u201cdid all they could\u201d, but he insists: \u201cI liked it there; going was the right decision and I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d Nor, though, did he regret leaving. On the pitch, opportunities were few at the Etihad Stadium. Given his age, that was always likely, but Su\u00e1rez hoped for more and departed without having played a Premier League game. \u201cTo start with Mancini showed a lot of trust and faith in me, he gave me confidence and my debut [in the League Cup against Wolves], but the team was competing for titles, so it\u2019s hard to put in young players. In the second year an injury slowed me down. At the end of it [Manuel] Pellegrini arrived. I had a year left but I got the offer from Bar\u00e7a: a year with the B\u00a0team, then the first team.\u201d What did Pellegrini say? \u201cTo stay,\u201d Su\u00e1rez replies. \u201cI always knew it would be difficult to get games, but...\u201d he says, looking for the right words. \u201cFor example, I see Arsenal play youth-teamers, or United with [Marcus] Rashford. I see teams give them opportunities, four or five games to see how they respond. At City that doesn\u2019t happen. Except now with [Kelechi] Iheanacho, they don\u2019t really back young players. I know it\u2019s difficult: City have a huge number of top-level players. They invest a lot of money in youth, look after them, give them everything they need to succeed, but at the hour of truth it\u2019s hard to take that next step.\u201d    I\u2019d always want James Milner in my team and I\u2019m sure coaches think the same.  Denis Su\u00e1rez     Will that change with Pep Guardiola? \u201cMaybe,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cBecause his philosophy is that if he sees a young player who is good enough, he backs him.\u201d Su\u00e1rez thinks English football would benefit from youth teams playing in the professional league, rather than a Reserves League, helping young players prepare for that step up. But, he adds: \u201cI also believe that to find out if someone is good enough, you have to try them. Arsenal do it, and it works. United do it. Liverpool have had [Raheem] Sterling, Suso, [Jordan] Ibe ... they\u2019ve been given opportunities.\u201d Su\u00e1rez saw his best opportunity lying elsewhere and in 2013 returned to Spain. \u201cFor a Spaniard, saying no to Barcelona is very difficult \u2013 even if you\u2019re at City,\u201d he says. Again, though, he found himself wanting more. He\u2019d sat through the final-year collapse of Mancini; now he arrived at Barcelona for that unsuccessful 2013-14 season under Tata Martino, a year that felt transitory even at the time. He starred for Barcelona\u2019s B team, finishing third in the Second Division, but got no first-team minutes. He did not expect to the following season, either, even when Luis Enrique arrived. Next stop: Sevilla on a two-year loan. Su\u00e1rez considered 46 games in his first top-flight season a success. But at the end of it, with Barcelona\u2019s Fifa ban making a recall impossible, he pushed for the chance to join Villarreal instead pleading with the Sevilla coach Unai Emery to let him go. Eventually, Villarreal paid Sevilla \u20ac3m and Barcelona \u20ac4m to buy him. The Catalans kept a buy-back clause, believed to be around \u20ac7m. \u201cHe\u2019s a good lad, but he said he\u2019d have more chance somewhere else,\u201d Emery admitted. He was right. Su\u00e1rez has played 31 league games, plus 12 times in the Europa League this season. When he rolled the ball across for Adri\u00e1n L\u00f3pez to score the last\u2011minute winner against Liverpool, it left him on the verge of a record for assists in this competition, with seven. It also left Villarreal on the verge of history. Su\u00e1rez has heard people say they celebrated too much, too soon, but he does not agree. And far from disrespecting Liverpool, he insists the opposite is true. \u201cLiverpool are a huge club, un grande. Imagine it: you beat a big, historic club in the Europa League semi-final, and in the last minute ... that doesn\u2019t happen every day.\u201d \u201cPeople know Atl\u00e9tico, Madrid, and Bar\u00e7a, and no one else exists. The game against Liverpool was our way of opening Villarreal up to the world, showcasing our identity and style, which you can see in the goal: a sharp, clean counterattack, a really good one,\u201d he says. As for Liverpool\u2019s style, he admits he was surprised to see them play without a striker but believes that what most effected them was losing Philippe Coutinho. Su\u00e1rez talks highly of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s tactical work and personality; talks highly, too, of two players who were team-mates at City.   Related: Explained: why five English clubs could play in next season\u2019s Champions League    \u201cKolo [Tour\u00e9] is a great guy, always positive,\u201d he says, but it is James Milner of whom he speaks most warmly and whose shirt he covets. Milner, it turns out, even speaks a bit of Spanish. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s underrated in England; what I do know is that I saw him every day and he ran more and trained better than anyone else,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cI\u2019d always want him in my team and I\u2019m sure coaches think the same. He always competes. Maybe he is rarely a 10 out 10 but he\u2019s always a notable [7 or 8]. \u201cThe Europa League\u2019s taken a leap forward: you can see how teams like Dortmund and Liverpool have treated it, teams used to the Champions League,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. And not because it is a gateway, a means of returning to that competition, which Villarreal have already done in anyway, but because of the glory, the moment, the memory. \u201cIf it then gives you access to the Champions League, great, but it\u2019s a title, a trophy,\u201d he insists. That matters. As he explains: \u201cLiverpool have loads of titles [already], sure, but Sevilla have become big through the Europa League\u201d. Villarreal aspire to the same and so does he. For Su\u00e1rez, this would be his second trophy in two years, having won the competition with Sevilla last season; for Villarreal, defeated in three European semi-finals, it would be a first in 93 years. No wonder there were queues in Castell\u00f3n. \u201cWe\u2019re living a historic season,\u201d he says. \u201cFourth in La Liga, semi\u2011finals against Liverpool, winning 1-0, last minute. It\u2019s not that we celebrated as if we\u2019d already won; it\u2019s that maybe people don\u2019t realise how big this is for us. And it\u2019s Liverpool \u2013 come on. Any player would love the chance to reach a European final; imagine having that chance at Anfield. \u201cFor Villarreal, it doesn\u2019t get bigger. If we get through, this would be the most important season in the club\u2019s history.\u201d",
