  "body": "It\u2019s a Thursday afternoon and 20-year-old singer-songwriter Ruth B finally has a free weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve been out on the road for so long that it really feels good to be sleeping in my own bed. It\u2019s nice to be home.\u201d Her brief respite comes in the middle of what\u2019s been a whirlwind three months after her debut single, Lost Boy, unexpectedly scaled the American charts. It\u2019s currently at a new peak of No 33 after three months on the Billboard Hot 100, quite an achievement for an unknown singing a tender piano ballad about Peter Pan. The song has rapidly catapulted Ruth Berhe from just another Canadian student looking forward to college to a breakout star.  Lost Boy must be the first-ever hit to have its origins on Vine, an app where users can post six-second videos. \u201cI had just graduated high school and saw that a friend from one of my science classes had posted a Vine on Twitter,\u201d Berhe says. \u201cI was like, \u2018What is this?\u2019 Vine was super new at the time, so I checked it out and downloaded it never thinking anything would come from it.\u201d             Growing up in Edmonton, the quiet capital city of Canada\u2019s Alberta province, Berhe always loved music. \u201cIt was as normal for me as breathing; not something I wanted to do, but needed to do.\u201d However, growing up she regarded it as just a hobby. \u201cI was never chasing to make a career out of it, but every day after school I\u2019d go to my keyboard and play for four hours and make up songs. It was a constant part of my life.\u201d One day early in 2015, Berhe was feeling inspired after watching the TV drama Once Upon a Time. \u201cIt\u2019s all about fairytales, so that day when I went to my keyboard that\u2019s what was on my mind.\u201d She then improvised some songs about Snow White and Rumplestiltskin. However, it was a lyric about Peter Pan that resonated. \u201cI came up with, \u2018I am a lost boy from Neverland, usually hanging out with Peter Pan\u201d and recorded that simple line on my phone. I watched it back and thought it was kinda cheesy and I was actually going to delete it. But I thought \u2018Whatever, it\u2019s catchy\u2019.\u201d             Berhe wound up posting the video on Vine. Within a week, those two lines, (length: a mere six seconds) had gone viral. \u201cIt got such a huge reaction with so many likes and that had never happened to me before,\u201d she says. \u201cIt inspired me to keep going because the majority of the comments were, \u2018We want to hear more of this!\u2019\u201d Giving her new fans what they wanted, Berhe posted another six-second video with a new set of lines \u2013 and another, and another. \u201cEventually I had a chorus and I put it all together on YouTube.\u201d The full version of Lost Boy was even more popular, launching Berhe from bedroom obscurity to a worldwide audience within weeks. (She only played her first live show two months ago in Los Angeles.) \u201cI\u2019m just really overwhelmed and shocked that people gravitated towards that particular Vine,\u201d she says. \u201cMost importantly, I was super excited that it was something that I had written and not a cover. It\u2019s been incredible to go on this journey and release snippet by snippet of it. I think that\u2019s why people like it, because they have a piece of the song. The fans are the ones who told me to write it and they saw the genesis of it in real time.\u201d The viral success of Lost Boy has propelled Berhe far beyond Vine. With the song becoming a constant presence on the radio, the track has successfully transitioned into the mainstream \u2013 no easy feat considering the countless hopeful artists who find success on Vine and then have a difficult time shaking the app from their identity. \u201cWhat I wanted to make sure of is that I wasn\u2019t just tagged as a Viner,\u201d she says. \u201cThe app was my way of getting my voice out of Edmonton and into the world. When I got my first email from a record label, I decided I didn\u2019t want to go in with just one song, so I sat down and kept on writing.\u201d Those songs have since resulted in her popular debut EP, The Intro. And luckily, throughout her growing success, inspiration keeps on flowing. \u201cWhen I first started writing a year ago, I\u2019d come up with a topic, then a melody and then write a song. Now every time I leave my house I feel like I\u2019m bound to run into a song. Whether it\u2019s a look on someone\u2019s face or something I go through; there\u2019s a song in every experience now.\u201d",
