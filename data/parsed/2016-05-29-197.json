There have been mise-en-sc\u00e8nes \u2013 Kate Moss\u2019s hologram at a McQueen show in 2006, a 256-tonne iceberg at Chanel\u2019s 2010 show and Fendi\u2019s $10m \u201clongest catwalk\u201d on the Great Wall of China from 2008 \u2013 that have suggested a level of grandeur and opulence on a par with the ancient Egyptians. Or at least a supercut of an Olympic Opening Ceremony. As the show becomes just as important as the clothes, the move towards ever more awe-inspiring historical venues follows suit. In 2016 it\u2019s all about the palatial show setting as a reminder of the roots. This summer, these are the most fashionable buildings in the world\u2026 Westminster Abbey The site of one of the key fashion moments in recent memory (the joyful union of Kate Middleton and her McQueen wedding dress), those famous cloisters will be enveloped with Gucci-ness by (former London habitu\u00e9) Alessandro Michele for a spring/summer show on 2 June. westminster-abbey.org     Gucci.

Their massively plush country house is testament to their still hugely influential (Miuccia Prada, Christopher Bailey) look.
