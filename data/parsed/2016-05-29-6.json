Related: Endless war: Trump and the fantasy of cost-free conflict    On the Sunday of the Memorial Day weekend, the Republican presidential nominee attended the Rolling Thunder rally, a huge gathering on the National Mall in Washington DC. Speaking to a crowd that spilled down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he was received as a conquering hero.  Trump repeatedly claimed \u2013 falsely \u2013 that hundreds of thousands were trying to attend the event, at one point claiming there were \u201c600,000 people trying to get in\u201d. There were no visible lines or back-ups at any point in or around the mall. Furthermore, according to the United States Census Bureau, the total population of the District of Colombia is just 672,228. Trump gave his standard stump speech, but the crowd had been primed by a one-term congressman from New York, John LeBoutillier, who insisted in his own speech that hundreds of American prisoners of war were still being held in Vietnam.  Repeated congressional investigations have found no evidence that any living prisoners of wars are still held in south-east Asia.  LeBoutillier also echoed Trump\u2019s infamous criticism of one prisoner of war who was held in Vietnam, in terrible conditions, and then came home: John McCain.  Last summer, speaking at a conservative conference, Trump suggested that the Arizona senator, who was awarded a Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Cross, was not a war hero.  \u201cThe comments that Donald Trump made about John McCain were totally justified,\u201d said LeBoutillier, who accused the 2008 Republican nominee of deliberately hiding the truth about POWs remaining in Vietnam. Trump did not addresses the issue of POWs being left behind, but he did touch on veteran\u2019s issues. Regarding the long-running crisis affecting the Department of Veterans Affairs, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to give the right for those people to see a private doctor or even a public doctor and get themselves taken care of and we\u2019re going to pay the bill.\u201d However, the Republican nominee dwelled mostly on crowd size, sharing his disappointment that he was speaking facing the Lincoln Memorial and not with it behind him.

The nominee also shared his skepticism about American alliances abroad.  \u201cI love Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to protect Japan hopefully. But you have to be prepared to walk.\u201d Trump had been less diplomatic about American-Japanese relations earlier on a Memorial Day weekend prefaced by Barack Obama\u2019s visit to and speech at Hiroshima.  On Saturday, he tweeted: \u201cDoes President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he\u2019s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW\u201d",
