  "body": "We live with an epidemic of anxiety. In 1980, 4% of Americans suffered a mental disorder associated with anxiety. Today half do. The trends in Britain are similar. A third of Britons will experience anxiety disorder at some stage in their life, with an explosion of reported anxiety among teenagers and young adults. Anxiety, depression, self-harm, attention deficit disorder and profound eating problems afflict our young as never before. Anxiety has always been part of the human condition \u2013 as has depression and tendencies to self-harm \u2013 but never, it seems, on this scale. A\u00a0number of trends appear to be colliding. This is an era when everyone is expected to find their personal route to happiness at the same time as the bonds of society, faith and community \u2013 tried and tested mechanisms to support wellbeing \u2013 are fraying. Teenagers in particular \u2013 fearful of missing out \u2013 are beset by a myriad of agonising choices about how to achieve the good life with fewer social and psychological anchors to help them navigate their way. Who can blame them if they respond with an ever rising sense of anxiety, if not panic? At the same time there has been a transformation in individuals\u2019 willingness and society\u2019s readiness to accept that the resulting anguish is not something inherent in the human condition \u2013 but often a form of malady that should be recognised and treated. In Jean Paul Sartre\u2019s Nausea, the (anti-) hero, Antoine Roquentin, is so plagued by wondering if existence has any purpose that he becomes intensely depressed and listless. Nausea was celebrated as breaking new literary ground in the 1930s, illuminating the essence of the human condition. Today Roquentin would be diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, and prescribed an antidepressant or invited to undergo a course of cognitive behavioural therapy. Is there, however, too great a readiness to pathologise the anxiety of being alive? Almost certainly. There is great and growing unease in parts of the psychology and psychiatry professions that too many practitioners have become trigger happy \u2013 too quick to prescribe mood-altering drugs to patients only going though life events, ranging from bereavement to divorce, which are naturally anxiety inducing. Life never was and never can be an uninterrupted progress towards utopian bliss. Grief following the loss of someone beloved, a great ambition thwarted or simply witnessing one\u2019s body age or wither through illness are all concomitants of being alive \u2013 pains alongside life\u2019s many wonderful pleasures On the other hand, there is no doubt that the patients complaining of acute mental anxiety feel intensely disturbed beyond some normal level of anxiousness \u2013 and that teenagers can feel this more acutely still. You cannot listen to mental health campaigner Natasha Devon \u2013 sacked last week from her role as a mental health champion for being too vocal, articulate and daring to criticise government policy on testing in schools \u2013 without recognising that she is addressing a social reality. Young women in particular are ever more transfixed with how they look to the point that, for a growing proportion, it is translating into mental health disorders with physical side-effects \u2013 bulimia, anorexia and self-harm. Asking them to snap out of it is not going to work. And while there probably is too great a readiness to pathologise anxiety, doctors and counsellors, faced with a growing epidemic, are only responding as best they can. To ignore what is going on would be equally damnable. What to do? Devon\u2019s campaign is part of the answer. Critics of the 30-year rise in the belief system that holds that economic and social wellbeing originates in as much individualism and free market as possible (along with diminished social, public and state institutions) usually focus on the exterior consequences, ranging from heightened inequality to weakening rates of innovation, investment and productivity. They are right, but there is another less frequently made criticism \u2013 what this worldview is doing to our mental lives. Happiness \u2013 when individual liberty is seen as all-important \u2013 lies in exercising choice and taking responsibility for our own lives. Get the choices right, and self-realisation, self-fulfillment and happiness will follow. Get them wrong and you risk mockery and marginalisation. Teenagers know as never before that they must get their choices right, pass their exams \u2013 and many will have 24/7 parents \u201chelping\u201d them in their quest. However, the act of making many choices with necessarily imperfect information perforce induces anxiety and stress \u2013 and once they are made, happiness does not automatically follow. Small wonder that teenagers in general, and teenage girls in particular, find the whole experience traumatising \u2013 as do their elders, even if they have better-developed emotional and psychological resource to deal with it. Which is why Devon\u2019s efforts to create a social movement to open up body image issues are so important. It is good that there is less stigma associated with mental health disorders: in January the prime minister endorsed such destigmatisation while announcing an extra \u00a31bn to address mental health issues. But there must also be an effort to get at the roots of what is happening \u2013 and that lies in more social interaction, and stronger social and public institutions that don\u2019t make individual choice the alpha and omega of everything. The government could never go that far \u2013 which is ultimately why Devon was sacked. The governing party will never feel at ease with social movements.    Happiness can never result from the exercise of choice alone: we are social beings    For happiness can never result from the exercise of choice alone: we are social beings, and the building blocks of happiness lie in looking out for each other, acting together, being in teams and pursuing common goals for the common good. Families, schools, colleges, unions, newspapers, sports clubs and even firms should all understand that such commonality should be part of their core DNA. Teenagers, for instance, need parents who understand that parenting is less about being friends with their children \u2013 partners in their kids\u2019 exercise of choice. Rather, parenting is about creating strong families in which parents have to lead and exercise authority \u2013 havens from the 24/7 intrusiveness of social media. For a generation the doctrine has been that the quest for a common good \u2013 in schools, in unions, in the delivery of public services \u2013 should be trumped by the expression of choice. The result is the anxiety epidemic. It can\u2019t and won\u2019t go on. Expect more Natasha Devons \u2013 and ultimately, one hopes, change.",
