  "body": "The \u201cchaos\u201d Danny Willett has found himself surrounded by since winning the Masters is endorsed by the number of rounds he has played since being presented with the Green Jacket a month ago. \u201cOne,\u201d the Yorkshireman admitted in Florida on Tuesday. Even that was a casual game with friends in Rotherham. \u201cEvery single spare minute we have had we have locked the door and tried to just have some time alone,\u201d Willett said. \u201cI was going to take a few weeks off and go on a holiday and just relax, take the little one away, and just do normal things but it\u2019s just been obviously a bit of chaos back home.   Related: The Agenda: Danny Willett back in action while Premier League reaches climax    \u201cSo it\u2019s not really been the quiet four weeks I was expecting \u2013 and in a good way. The idea had been to get prepped and ready for a really busy spell leading up to the next couple of majors.\u201d How things changed on the evening of 10 April at Augusta National as Willett sealed his Masters success. The Players Championship marks his return to competitive golf, with the sense of a routine probably a welcome one for the 28-year-old. \u201cI don\u2019t think you approach it differently at all,\u201d Willett said. \u201cI\u2019ll approach it the same as I approached Augusta, as I approached the week before that, and do the bits I can do and take care of my little jobs every day. Then hopefully if you do all that you can shoot some good numbers.\u201d A year ago here, Willett was making his Players Championship debut. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty crazy 12 months. Yeah, it was a fantastic last year. \u201cYou do pinch yourself but I knew it was in there. You dream about it, you practise hard for it and then when it does happen, you have got to pinch yourself and appreciate just what you\u2019ve done. It does kind of go into your personal life a little bit. You can\u2019t go and have a nice quiet drink; you get people asking for pictures, autographs. It comes with the territory. You can\u2019t really complain about signing a few autographs and taking a few pictures because you\u2019ve just won the Masters.\u201d Should Willett require a sense of perspective, it routinely arrives from his family. He appeared miffed when asked whether his parents had given special words of post-Masters praise. \u201cI spoke to my mum on the phone after I just won and I\u2019ve obviously seen my parents since but we don\u2019t really talk golf,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much the conversation that happens within family. It is far from talking about golf and stuff, and far from talking about one person\u2019s achievements. \u201cMum\u2019s got four boys and my dad\u2019s got four boys; talking about one will be a little bit harsh on the other three, so, no, we just talk about more normal everyday things.\u201d Willett will have Brandt Snedeker and Justin Rose for company in the opening two rounds. The draw with Rose is particularly appealing, given his US Open triumph in 2013. \u201cEngland\u2019s only two major champions from the last 20 years playing together,\u201d Rose said with a smile on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice little club we\u2019ve got going and I\u2019ll have to make sure I welcome him as the newest member. \u201cI was just packing my bags at Augusta when he holed his final putt, so I hung around to say congratulations. Danny\u2019s brain was probably a little fried just then and he probably doesn\u2019t even remember seeing me. \u201cIt will be interesting to hear how the past few weeks have been for him. When I won my US Open I think I was probably a bit more ready for it. I was a top-five player and 15 years as a pro; if anything I felt it was probably a little overdue. It has happened much quicker for Danny and I\u2019ll be keen to see how he has managed to take it all in. \u201cHe played great that week and whatever happens here I can certainly see him using Augusta as a springboard to contend pretty regularly in the biggest events we play.\u201d",
