Researchers working in 100 British primary schools will try to find out from September, thanks to a \u00a3290,000 grant from the Education Endowment Foundation to test whether instructing children aged 10 and 11 in \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d, an idea from American psychology, can improve results. \u201cGrowth mindset\u201d is the name given by psychologist Carol Dweck to the idea that intelligence can develop, and that effort leads to success. Her influential research, which has been lapped up by thousands of teachers in the UK, divides people according to what Dweck calls implicit theories of intelligence. If we think talent or braininess is innate and something we cannot change, we have a \u201cfixed mindset\u201d (blamed by Dweck for the Enron scandal, among other ills). If we believe our performance at school and in life can be changed by our attitude, and particularly by how we cope with setbacks, we have a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d. The British study, called Changing Mindsets, will test its effectiveness using videos and quizzes developed by education company Positive Edge in year 6 classrooms, while psychologists will train teachers for one day. \u201cExpectations change neurology; if you have low expectations of a child their brain starts to function worse,\u201d says Sherria Hoskins, the Portsmouth University professor leading the study. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying you can turn a child who is struggling at maths into a maths genius. The message is about getting\u00a0better.\u201d The videos feature actors playing Darwin, Einstein and Olympic athlete Wilma Rudolph, describing their achievements in ways that emphasise a growth mindset. \u201cThere was nothing special about my intellect,\u201d announces Darwin. \u201cThe ability to change and adapt has been key to our existence.\u201d     David James, professor of social sciences at Cardiff , says there is \u2018a bit of desperation\u2019 to unearth evidence that anything other than inequality explains the attainment gap.    The study will look at what Hoskins calls \u201clearning behaviour\u201d as well as attainment, meaning how children manage themselves and whether they learn from mistakes. But the results will depend on Sats scores, and whether the pupils who receive the training and watch the films do better than a control group who do not. \u201cIt\u2019s about the language you use with pupils,\u201d Hoskins says. \u201cInstead of praising them around ability or static factors related to who they are \u2013 for example, saying \u2018you\u2019re so good at drawing\u2019 \u2013 you move to feedback based on effort, strategy and results. Many people don\u2019t realise praise can be dangerous.\u201d While there is widespread support for the principle of evidence-based policy, and for an approach that promotes trying over talent, growth mindset itself is a topic of heated debate. Last year Dweck was reported to be concerned about growth mindset \u201cmisuse\u201d, and told Schools Week she was kept awake at night by the fear that mindset was becoming \u201cthe new self-esteem\u201d \u2013 an idea bandied about by teachers who had not properly understood it and used it to \u201cmake kids feel good about any effort\u201d. Hoskins says she is frustrated by the extent to which views are polarised, with mindset viewed either as a magic wand or a fad. This may sound overblown if you have never heard of growth mindset, or Dweck, but it took time for ideas about self-esteem and mindfulness to find their way into everyday life too. Becky Francis, newly appointed director of the Institute of Education and adviser to the education select committee, says the notion that anyone can improve with application and high expectations is positive, and he points to the correspondence between Dweck\u2019s work and knowledge gleaned from sociology. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence about teachers bracketing students from particular backgrounds, and how attainment can be a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d she says. \u201cSince the 1960s we have known that kids put in low-ability groups get the message very quickly.\u201d Others welcome the injection of ideas about how children learn at a time when the curriculum is becoming less focused on skills and more on knowledge. Peter Fonagy, professor of psychoanalysis at University College London, says: \u201cThe idea that we can help people develop, that we are not bound by social or biological constraints, frees up the brain as well as the system.\u201d He cites John Hattie\u2019s finding that teachers\u2019 grasp of their pupils\u2019 problems is crucial. \u201cCommunication is enormously important. Psychology, or one human\u2019s understanding of another, enormously enhances the learning experience.\u201d Thomas Westenholz, the Danish businessman behind Positive Edge, says he regrets the extent to which the trial featuring his videos and quizzes is tied to academic results. \u201cThere\u2019s a complete obsession with testing in this country,\u201d he tells me. \u201cMy interest is in improving long-term wellbeing, not a narrow focus on grades, but it is not possible to get funding for this.\u201d Westenholz, whose previous venture was a company specialising in claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance, traces his own interest in growth mindset to when his newborn son was dangerously ill, and he and his wife refused to accept a bleak prognosis. \u201cI saw in hospital how parents struggled who didn\u2019t have a growth mindset,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about building resilience: how do you deal with things when they get really tough?\u201d   Related: Labeling students 'gifted' isn't helpful - working harder makes you smarter    Whatever his private motives, Positive Edge markets itself as a tool to boost results and shrink the gap between wealthier and poorer pupils. Its website claims \u201cGrowth mindset naturally creates what Ofsted wants\u201d, asserts that the key issue for disadvantaged students is often \u201cnegative attitude\u201d, and even suggests a report showing \u201chow your pupil premium spending is impacting achievement\u201d. While Hoskins, listed on the website as an adviser, is more cautious, she too suggests that mindset training could be targeted either at children who are struggling academically, or who are eligible for free school meals (and additional funding). Since the foundation supporting the research was created with the aim of narrowing the attainment gap, this emphasis is no surprise. But it is cause for concern to those who are sceptical about the growth mindset approach, because they fear it risks becoming another way of blaming poor pupils for their lack of progress. Matt O\u2019Leary, an education lecturer at Birmingham City University, tweeted how \u201cfarcical\u201d it was that his six-year-old daughter was being graded on her attitude to learning. While he believes children are influenced by continuous putdowns, he says the idea of schools grading attitude is \u201cvery worrying\u201d. He also fears that, far from cutting against the grain of increased testing and hierarchies, mindset could become yet another thing children are assessed on. David James, professor of social sciences at Cardiff and editor of the British Journal of Sociology of Education, takes this critique further. While he says \u201cit\u2019s great to dwell on the fact that intelligence is not fundamentally genetic and unchangeable\u201d, he believes the limitations of mindset outweigh its\u00a0uses. \u201cIf teachers are being rewarded on the basis of whether they get a few kids over the \u2018C\u2019 borderline this year, it\u2019s very naive to come along and say \u2018you need to change the way your kids think about themselves\u2019. It individualises the failure \u2013 \u2018they couldn\u2019t change the way they think, so that\u2019s why they failed\u2019.\u201d James questions why the new study is needed when a previous one, in 2013, showed no statistically significant effect, and suggests there is \u201ca bit of desperation\u201d to unearth evidence that anything other than inequality explains the attainment gap. He believes the search for individually focused explanations is what lies behind the current interest in \u201ccharacter\u201d and argues that psychology, with its quizzes and carryover into self-help, has more popular appeal and is more to current policymakers\u2019 tastes than sociology, with its structures and systems. Francis, meanwhile, suggests a connection between mindset, coaching and a broader movement towards individualised problem-solving, \u201cwhen of course a lot of our problems are structural and institutional\u201d. But she thinks mindset could prove a useful tool, for example in tackling what she calls the very British phenomenon of giving up on maths. Westenholz calls it a \u201csmall piece of a much bigger puzzle\u201d, while UCL\u2019s Fonagy emphasises the importance of influencing teachers if it is to have any effect. No one I spoke to denied that evidence exists showing mindset to be a factor influencing learning. Doubts centre on whether similar results will be obtained in English schools. Will the films\u2019 dramatic stories, stirring music and inspirational messages have any demonstrable effect on the children who see them? All will be revealed when the study\u2019s results are published in\u00a02018.",
