She looms above the bed,\u00a0chuckling seductively, diamonds bright, skin oddly\u00a0mottled on account of the photo\u00a0transfer being stuck straight on to the pebble dash. Turn to the right and there\u2019s Paul Newman, smouldering gaze\u00a0directed at the travel kettle.   Related: Cannes MC says his Woody Allen rape joke was misinterpreted    Cannes, where I am based for the film festival, is so keen on cinema that even its hotel walls shout about it. The\u00a0breakfast bar has dubious quotes from Jack Nicholson and James\u00a0Dean, pace Mark Twain (\u201cNever\u00a0regret anything that makes you\u00a0smile\u201d), stencilled above the toast. One swanky\u00a0pal tells of staying somewhere on Cannes\u2019 main drag where\u00a0the toilet paper was designed to look like a spool of celluloid. If entertainment is your primary touchstone \u2013 for life, for art, for loo roll \u2013\u00a0it naturally follows it also provides your go-to points of comparison. For films, this has a logic. The new Ken Loach? A blunter Bread and Roses. Money Monster? The Big Short for kids. But when it comes to people, such casual cultural shorthand risks becoming a touch too reductive. Is it offensive to call Kristen Stewart a punky Jodie Foster? Faintly, maybe. Jesse Plemons a cuddlier Matt Damon?\u00a0Possibly not. How about likening Woody Allen to Roman Polanski or Bill Cosby? This seems to me pretty clear-cut. It is wrong, lazy and dangerous. Yet it is done repeatedly. Over the past week it has been the Polanski comparison that got more eyelids batting. \u201cYou\u2019ve shot so many of your films here in Europe,\u201d said the comedian Laurent Lafitte, MC at the opening gala, \u201cand yet in the US you haven\u2019t even been convicted of rape.\u201d Lafitte is here all week. The Cosby nod was from Allen\u2019s own son, Ronan Farrow, and has gone less checked. It was intended differently,\u00a0too: pointedly, potently, yet couched in the same like-for-like showbiz rhetoric in which we\u2019re all fluent. Farrow first invoked it in a tweet to the editor of the Hollywood Reporter, to critique its interview with Allen: \u201cLove you, Janice, but what\u2019s next, a Bill Cosby cover?\u201d He repeated it in an article in the same publication, in which he condemned his father, the festival, the press and those stars who work with\u00a0him.           Versus trailer for documentary about Palme d\u2019Or winning director Ken Loach    Yet the three cases are very different. Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977. He served 42 days in prison, was put on probation, then fled from the US to Paris before sentencing. He has apologised to the victim for his behaviour; she doesn\u2019t now feel extradition is necessary: \u201cHe said he did it, he pleaded guilty, he went to jail. I don\u2019t know what people want from\u00a0him.\u201d Cosby has been accused of the rape and, in many cases, drugging to unconsciousness of more than 60 women over more than 40 years. Last year he was charged with sexual assault, an arrest warrant issued and bail set at\u00a0$1m. His trial is pending.   Related: Cannes 2016: Desparate times as we review George Clooney in Money Monster - the Dailies film podcast    Allen was accused of one incident of molestation by a seven-year-old at the height of the custody battle between him and the child\u2019s mother in 1993. The allegations were looked into by authorities and not pursued. The judge said the evidence relating to sex abuse charges was inconclusive. After 14 months\u2019 investigation, the New York department of social services said: \u201cNo credible evidence was found that the child named in this report has been abused or maltreated.\u201d No one else has ever lodged such a complaint against him. Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi, successfully adopted two girls in the years immediately following. Farrow feels that there has been a miscarriage of justice. He sees the\u00a0difficulty of his step-sister subsequently getting airtime for her case as linked to the fact that it has not been\u00a0\u201cvindicated by conviction\u201d. This is true: it has not. This isn\u2019t just an inconvenience; it is important. And from the outside at least, it doesn\u2019t appear to have been so hard. The legal case ended more than 20 years ago, but the media trial continues. In recent years it has gathered steam as the Farrows have restated their claims, and as social media has facilitated wider debate \u2013 or stoked flames of prurience disguised as self-righteousness. The concept of innocent until proved guilty is, in theory, absolute. Scepticism is always to be encouraged. But in Allen\u2019s case, it is rather more than this. The done thing is instead to simply dismiss the principle, ignore the law and\u00a0rely instead on rumour. In his piece, Farrow attacks the press for their failure to ask Allen \u201chard questions\u201d. Yet they have, and the answers remain the same: he denies the allegations and believes that his former partner poisoned the children against him \u2013 as, incidentally, does Ronan\u2019s sibling Moses. Farrow also takes aim at what he sees as a powerful PR machine insulating Allen. Yet not only does the director appear pretty riddled with potshots, he\u2019s also someone that I, at least, have found strikingly easy to access. Now 80, he did three days of press at Cannes. His publicists do not sit in on his interviews; you are free to ask anything; he always replies. In this field that is unusual. For someone of Allen\u2019s age and status, it is remarkable.

But if innocent people \u2013 and this, the fact remains, is what Allen is \u2013 are to be blacklisted because some people think them fishy, we are in very murky water. This is not, thankfully, a world where the art of those people actually convicted of heinous crimes is censored. We are still free to look at paintings by that murderer Caravaggio, and read poems by incestuous Byron. We are encouraged to take our children to the new Alice Through the Looking Glass\u00a0film, despite its almost certainly unsavoury inspiration. Ought we to also chuck out our Sinatra records,\u00a0given his Mafia links? People police themselves through their own moral codes. But film festivals\u00a0must stand aside. Writing for the Guardian this week to back Farrow, and explain her own boycott of Allen\u2019s movies, Melissa Silverstein called the director \u201cTeflon\u201d. But he is not. Smears leave an unshiftable residue. His reputation has suffered. But that he is still\u00a0celebrated is not the result of collusion. It\u2019s because what ultimately didn\u2019t stick were the charges.",
