  "body": "Congratulations to author Alexis Deacon and illustrator Vivian Schwarz who have just won this year\u2019s Little Rebels children\u2019s book awards with I Am Henry Finch (Walker Books).  Their picture book is about a young finch called Henry who branches out from the sameness of his flock in order to discover his own individuality and, ultimately, his own greatness!   Related: How to draw\u2026 a finch    Kerry Mason, from Letterbox Library which runs the award for the ARB (Alliance of Radical Booksellers) said: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute gem of a picture book. It deploys the simplest of graphics and text to ponder vast questions about our humanity. Viviane Schwarz\u2019s blood red thumbprint finches get to the beating heart of our existence and Alexis Deacon\u2019s minimalist, beautifully structured, sentences are like a beginner\u2019s course in existentialist thought. This is a book which respects and honours the youngest of readers, believing them capable of and thirsty for philosophical thought.\u201d The winner of the Little Rebels Children\u2019s Book Award 2016 was announced by judge Wendy Cooling at the fourth London Radical Bookfair, organised by the ARB and held at Goldsmiths University in London.   Related: The 2016 Little Rebels children's book award shortlist is revealed    The Little Rebels Children\u2019s Book Award has been running since 2012 and recognises books that celebrate social justice and equality for children aged 0-12.

And a special chirp, chirp, chirp (that means \u201cyou\u2019re amazing\u201d in finch tweet) to Alexis Deacon and Viviane Schwarz for making the winning book: I Am Henry Finch. You can buy I Am Henry Finch by Alexis Deacon and Viviane Schwarz from the Guardian bookshop.",
