Related: Sacked children's mental health tsar Natasha Devon: 'I was proper angry'    Hospitalisations from self-harm have doubled in the past three years. Admissions from eating disorders are rocketing, according to the charity YoungMinds. Growing numbers of teenagers are deliberately poisoning themselves. But when Devon tried to talk to ministers about \u201cwhat\u2019s going on\u201d to create this scale of distress for young people, she says \u201cit was like talking to a brick\u201d. As she puts it: if the government really wants to solve the children\u2019s mental health crisis, it needs to actually acknowledge the causes. It may want to start by looking close to home: \u201cThis government and the coalition before them have engineered a social climate where it\u2019s really difficult for any young person to enjoy optimal mental health,\u201d Devon said shortly before her role was terminated. \u201cParents work every hour God sends to make ends meet, meaning reduced quality family time spent together. Spiralling poverty means the number of young people relying on food banks reached one million as we entered 2015. Schools are increasingly being relied upon to give pupils breakfast.\u201d Poverty puts children at risk of mental health problems. This is not something about which any politician can claim ignorance: back in 2012 the chief medical officer reported that children in the poorest households were three times more likely to have a mental illness than children in wealthier homes. What Devon points to is backed up by study after study. Reductions in family incomes \u2013 including benefit cuts \u2013 are likely to have \u201cwide-ranging negative effects\u201d on children\u2019s mental health. Families struggling with debt and parents trying to get by on low wages are both proven factors. The housing a young person lives in \u2013 if it\u2019s damp or overcrowded \u2013 affects them. Even growing up in a cold home is linked to an increased risk of depression and anxiety. And what has the government chosen to do? Introduce policies like the benefit cap and the bedroom tax, and freeze local housing allowance \u2013 so exacerbating insecure, low-quality housing \u2013 along with changes to benefits, from universal credit to personal independence payments, that push already struggling families into financial hardship. Benefit cuts don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Sanction a mother\u2019s jobseeker\u2019s allowance or take a father\u2019s sickness benefit after declaring them \u201cfit for work\u201d and their children suffer too. Cut an adult\u2019s housing benefit as rents rise and social housing is abandoned and it is children who end up sleeping in cramped B&Bs. In light of the cuts already devastating families in this country, experts have warned about the impact of continual austerity on children\u2019s mental wellbeing.   Related: Mental health champion for UK schools axed after criticising government    But still the government presses ahead. It\u2019s telling that, when asked to highlight other leading causes of the mental health crisis (alongside social media and school pressure), Devon points to the cuts to child and adolescent mental services. That\u2019s \u00a385m gone in six years \u2013 and with it social workers, support programmes for parents, educational psychologists and targeted mental health services in schools. With one hand the government is damaging children\u2019s wellbeing by slashing the benefits their parents rely on; with the other it\u2019s cutting the mental health services they then need for support. No matter how hard parents try to protect their children from reality \u2013 pretending that they\u2019re not eating dinner because they\u2019re not hungry, rather than because the family can\u2019t afford enough food \u2013 children notice when their mother\u2019s been crying again or the bailiffs have come. And if there is no money for rent, there is no money to pay for private doctors and therapists. Devon\u2019s role has been axed, but the crisis she has highlighted won\u2019t disappear as easily \u2013 and it could continue to grow without people like her, willing to ask the government difficult questions. We\u2019re now rightly comfortable talking about the impact of Facebook and Twitter on young people or the effect of relentless exams. But when it comes to mental health, poverty is still the elephant in the room.",
