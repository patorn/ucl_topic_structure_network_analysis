  "body": "Ahead of Thursday\u2019s white paper, which could change the BBC as we know it, emotions have been stirred amid fears the government will erode the corporation\u2019s editorial independence.   Related: BBC charter renewal: the main sticking points    At the Bafta awards ceremony on Sunday Peter Kosminsky, director of Wolf Hall, accused the government of trying to \u201ceviscerate\u201d the BBC and Channel 4 and a former home office minister told the Guardian on Tuesday editorial independence is a \u201cred line\u201d that must not be crossed. We asked Guardian readers to tell us what the BBC means to them as listeners, viewers and readers of the corporation\u2019s output, and how they see its future. Many of you wanted to send a message to the government about a national treasure that must remain free from political interference, though some of you were pragmatic in calling for some change.  Overwhelmingly readers were passionate about an institution that has a large part in their lives and, because of the way it is funded, the idea you should have a large say in its future. These are some of your responses \u2013 you can add yours in the comments below. \u2018Endangering its editorial freedom is not the way forward\u2019     Jan Mills    The BBC is my trusted source of information, my drama companion and provider of a window into worlds beyond my own. It is the Great Britain I love \u2013 eclectic, intelligent and open. Endangering its editorial freedom is not the way forward. You will lose all that is best about the BBC and if you do that the Tories will be remembered forever for one thing \u2013 destroying a part of our way of life. I say to them: think again. Better scrutiny of its finances has to happen but all that is needed is greater transparency and an independent audit once every two years. The rest works well and should be left alone.Jan Mills, company director, 65, South East England \u2018The BBC should be free to expose government corruption or incompetence\u2019 Do not destroy the BBC by starving it of funds or by dictating content. The BBC generally provides high quality programmes and news coverage: it should stand as a benchmark for other providers and should not be reduced to their level. Yes, it may occasionally embarrass politicians by exposing government corruption or incompetence, but that is better than having news and content based purely on the commercial benefit and political views of a small number of wealthy individuals.Barry Westby, 64, Nottingham  \u2018The white paper plans are monstrous\u2019 I have been a Tory voter most of my life but if this government diminishes the BBC in any way, or undermines its independence by imposing government appointees to a new board, as well as the chairman and deputy, I will never vote Tory again. The public does not want a state broadcaster: the apparent plans in the white paper are monstrous. The vast majority of the public will hate this government if it does not abolish Mr Whittingdale\u2019s plans \u2013 he should take note of the many petitions and consultations overwhelmingly indicating this. The BBC belongs to us, the public, not the government.Anonymous, 75, Surrey \u2018The BBC must give future generations inspiration\u2019     Luke Emmett    The BBC has done such good for so many people and is consistently finding new ways to surprise us. We must protect the institution and what it serves to do. It has brilliant principles and continues to have massive fanbases for all its shows. I say to the government, please don\u2019t destroy the BBC \u2013 we don\u2019t have anything else as special, unique and wonderful as what it gives us. The future should be inventive and expansive and allow shows to celebrate what they can do while allowing creative talent to burst through and future generations to have funding and inspiration to continue its brilliant legacy.Luke Joseph Emmett, 20, Weybridge \u2018The BBC needs to be many things to many people\u2019 My mother is 95, was born in the Far East, is a long-time Conservative voter and has listened to the BBC her entire life. She is horrified at any hint of government influence on BBC programming or news. I suggest the government ignores people like her at its peril. The BBC needs to be many things to many people, from Strictly to Bake Off to news that hurts politicians. I would like to see its administration and financing taken away from government completely with the formation of a public body away from Whitehall to be put in charge of the licence fee and given the role of protecting the BBC from political intrusion. CC Hogan, 55 \u2018Listen to the BBC\u2019s stars and learn\u2019     Sean    I say to the government, keep your grubby hands off our BBC. It is a world-class public service broadcaster, not answerable to shareholders or reliant on advertisers. The BBC board needs to remain independent and not full of government appointees and cronies: listen to its stars and learn. Public service broadcasting, with a brief to inform, educate and entertain, paid for by the general licence fee works. If it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it.Sean, gardener, 60, London \u2018Independence is too important a principle to be lost\u2019 Teaching and entertaining us must continue, for who else would do it? The BBC gave me my love of computer programming with its BBC Micro project in the 80s, Horizon, although dumbed down, has no equal, and I love the BBC\u2019s Reithian remit. The politicians of old got it right \u2013 independent funding and independence from government are principles too important to be lost. The role of government should be to occasionally fine tune the BBC remit and ensure that it continues to exist and evolve, as it is doing now, leading the way with new models of distribution. Anonymous, 69, Sussex \u2018This pressure every 10 years is unnecessary and threatens the BBC\u2019s integrity\u2019 The BBC is ours like the NHS: these are the last two remaining beacons of hope and the government wants to rid us of them in their current guise as money is to be made. I would be happy for the licence fee to continue in its current guise \u2013 I think it\u2019s cheap and value for money but they should try to experiment with more work from the arts and have BBC Three reinstated to TV rather than internet only. The BBC has to be independent and not have this pressure applied every ten years, threatening its integrity.Matt, Photographer, 40, Southampton \u2018One should feel sorry for John Whittingdale and David Cameron\u2019 If the government harm the BBC it they will be taking away a large part of my life: they have no right to strip away the culture of this country. One should feel sorry for John Whittingdale and David Cameron for lacking soul and culture \u2013 and just wanting their politics and ideas to be the only ones millions of UK citizens are allowed to experience. I have written to my MP but Philip Hammond just replied with the party line: the government\u2019s plans could reduce my quality of life \u2013 but they won\u2019t listen.Sian Williams, early years teacher, 54, Surrey \u2018The BBC should reflect the people and communities it reaches\u2019     Isabel    The BBC should remain editorially independent of the government and should strive at all times to reflect, in an unbiased and inclusive way, the people and communities it reaches, both in the UK and abroad. Let it remain a flagship of broadcasting, admired throughout the world. Let it not become politically influenced. The cost of a TV licence is too cheap in my view \u2013 I am not wealthy, but would be prepared to pay a higher price for the privilege of watching a channel with no advertising which produces programmes of high quality and wide remit.Isabel, self-employed, 60, Scotland \u2018Do not let the BBC dominate the intellectual and cultural life of this country\u2019 My message to the government would be this: do not let the BBC dominate the intellectual and cultural life of this country in the way it does. It has demonstrated time and again that it cannot be trusted. We need a very much more modest and trimmer BBC. I deeply resent being forced to pay for this bloated organisation.Michael Quigley, engineer, 45, Birmingham \u2018I am happy to pay but we need a better model in the digital age\u2019     Caroline    The BBC is famous globally for its output and the government are threatening to ruin that. Leave the experts to run the BBC: you are politicians, not broadcasters. The amount of money they get, what they choose to spend it on and when they choose to schedule those programmes should be left to the experts. The government have no place meddling with how the BBC operates, but I do think the BBC could do with a better business model \u2013 the licence fee is outdated. I am more than happy to pay for services, but we need a model more in keeping with the digital age.Caroline, digital project manager, 38, Kent \u2018The BBC has literally said \u2018sorry, goodbye\u2019 to young people\u2019     Jake    I used to use the BBC\u2019s services much more when BBC Three was on the TV \u2013 I imagine they\u2019ll have lost a lot of viewers from my generation. Why can\u2019t our public service broadcaster be truly run for the public? Plans for the future need to remember the people who will be paying a licence fee in the years to come are the ones who are the most disengaged from the service \u2013 the BBC has literally said \u201csorry, goodbye\u201d to young people by closing its channel aimed at them and moving it online. Do they think we don\u2019t watch actual TV now?Jake, student, 17, Darlington  \u2018I am proud of the BBC and long may it continue\u2019 The BBC should be applauded, encouraged and supported, not undermined, curtailed and decimated. It\u2019s the envy of the world and its reputation for fair, impartial reporting is second to none. It does everything well: drama, news, documentaries, sport, current affairs, entertainment \u2013 the list is endless. As a British citizen I am proud of the BBC and long may it continue. The government seems to be actively planning the demise, downfall and destruction of probably the best broadcasting organisation in the world. It beggars belief.Jennifer, retired teacher, 65, Wales",
