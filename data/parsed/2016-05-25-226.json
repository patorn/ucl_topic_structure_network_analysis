Tsai Ing-wen, who has studied at LSE and Cornell University, was sworn in as the self-ruled island\u2019s new president last Friday. In her inaugural address, the Democratic Progressive party politician urged citizens to reject prejudice and look to the future.    Related: Taiwan's new president Tsai Ing-wen vows to reduce dependence on Beijing    Across the Taiwan strait in mainland China, Beijing\u2019s official propaganda and news agency, Xinhua, appeared to be staring in a different direction.  An opinion piece published by the International Herald Leader, a Xinhua-run newspaper, suggested Tsai was likely to be obsessed with detail and hold radical views that could encourage her to seek formal independence from China because she was unmarried and had no children.  \u201cAs a single female politician, she does not have the emotional burden of love, of \u2018family\u2019 or children. So her political style and strategy tend to be emotional, personalised and extreme,\u201d Wang Weixing, an official from a Beijing-controlled body that handles relations with Taiwan, wrote.  \u201cWhen dealing with Tsai, we should bear in mind important factors such as her experience, personality and mindset,\u201d added Wang, from the association for relations across the Taiwan strait.  Alex Huang, a spokesman for Tsai, told the BBC she would not comment on Xinhua\u2019s chauvinism. But the Chinese internet had plenty to say. \u201cHow dare you attack her personal life!\u201d fumed one user of Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. \u201cMale chauvinist pig,\u201d wrote another. In an online post, Zhang Hongzhong, a journalism professor from Beijing Normal University, lamented the article as both intellectually flawed and highly offensive to single women. \u201cSince Xinhua is a state-run news agency, it will also damage our country\u2019s image,\u201d Zhang added.  Amid growing outrage, the piece was eventually removed from the newspaper\u2019s website and replaced with a message that read: \u201cSorry, page not found.\u201d  The article is at odds with President Xi Jinping\u2019s professed commitment to gender equality. \u201cWe must build up women\u2019s capacity of playing their part in society and the economy, involve women in higher levels of decision making and support them in becoming leaders in political, business and academic fields,\u201d he told a summit at the United Nations last September.  However, feminists say Chinese security forces have cracked down on their campaigning activities since Xi took power in 2012. Last year celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the UN\u2019s Fourth Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 were outlawed.  There are still no women serving on the Communist party\u2019s elite seven-member ruling council and only a handful anywhere near the top of Chinese politics.  Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
