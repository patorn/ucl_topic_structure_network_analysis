  "body": "You know that awkward thing where you are talking about someone, and they happen to be standing behind you? At Sunday\u2019s sell-out session at the Sydney writers\u2019 festival, ABC journalist Sarah Ferguson described former Labor senator John Faulkner as a \u201cfetishist\u201d \u2013 only to have him pop up in the audience during question time. Ferguson was at the festival discussing the making of her three-part television series The Killing Season with journalist George Megalogenis; the series covered the Labor party\u2019s recent bloodletting years, and is the subject of a new book by Ferguson.   Related: Tony Abbott, the Rudd effect, and the perils of removing first term prime ministers    Ferguson characterised party power broker Faulkner as making a \u201cfetish of his discretion\u201d, for not disclosing what happened during the fateful night that Julia Gillard told then prime minister Kevin Rudd that she was challenging him for the party leadership. Rudd and Gillard both offered the journalist differing accounts of what happened, and Faulkner was the only other person in the room. Ferguson told the audience, \u201cI like to give John a hard time. I think he makes a fetish of his discretion. How could you argue against discretion not being a good thing in politics? But I think you can argue that that event in the room doesn\u2019t belong to him, it belongs to history.\u201d Faulkner has said he will never disclose what was said that evening in the office. \u201cNeither publicly nor privately or any other way will I share with you what happened in the prime minister\u2019s office,\u201d he has told a reporter. And when it came time for questions at the Sydney writers\u2019 festival event, Faulkner stood up in the audience, to gales of laughter. Interviewer George Megalogenis said: \u201cYou should identify yourself.\u201d  Said Faulkner, over loud applause: \u201cI said I would not talk about the events, and that is the basis of which I was there. And I know it doesn\u2019t suit journalists and I know it would be helpful if I retold those events \u2026 But I gave my word, I am honouring my word \u2013 and I am not a fetishist!\u201d Ferguson later denied the encounter was \u201cawkward\u201d on Twitter.    Not awkward, good! I have made the point to John F in person prior to this.  https://t.co/foshjaxvdP\u2014 Sarah Ferguson (@FergusonNews) May 22, 2016    Megalogenis tweeted it was a festival highlight for him:     @BridgetOFlynn Still processing the shock. It was the highlight of the festival for me. @FergusonNews\u2014 George Megalogenis (@GMegalogenis) May 22, 2016    One audience member later told Guardian Australia, \u201cSarah was very composed and didn\u2019t miss a beat. She was very unflappable.\u201d",
