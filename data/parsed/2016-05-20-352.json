  "body": "A participant in the Oregon militia standoff at a wildlife refuge pleaded guilty to conspiring against the federal government on Thursday, making him the first of 26 jailed protesters to accept a deal with US prosecutors. Corey Lequieu, 46, pleaded guilty to using force, intimidation and threats to impede federal officers at the Malheur national wildlife refuge, where a group of activists, some heavily armed, staged an occupation in January to protest the government\u2019s treatment of ranchers. Brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, who helped lead the protests, refused to enter pleas at their arraignments, resulting in a a judge entering a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea on their behalf, paving the way for a high-profile trial. \u201cIt was the best option available,\u201d Lequieu\u2019s girlfriend Debra Carter Pope said in an interview Thursday. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to him and to me is family. \u2026 It\u2019s better than being in there for years and years.\u201d Federal prosecutors have recommended that Lequieu spend two-and-a-half years in prison and have agreed not to level any additional charges against him, according to the Oregonian. In the government\u2019s indictment he had originally faced two additional charges related to his possession of firearms at the bird sanctuary. The conspiracy charge for which Lequieu pleaded guilty carries a maximum sentence of six years. The activists took over a number of government buildings at the refuge headquarters to protest the imprisonment of two eastern Oregon ranchers convicted of arson offenses. The Bundy brothers and their supporters have argued that the federal government has no right regulating public lands in the west and have continued to argue in court that US prosecutors lack jurisdiction in the case. Their philosophy gained traction in the west in 2014 when their father Cliven Bundy staged a standoff with the federal government at the family\u2019s ranch after refusing for years to pay grazing fees. Cliven, too, is behind bars, awaiting trial for the 2014 standoff and has also refused to enter a plea. Lequieu and his girlfriend, who are from Fallon, Nevada, were both regular presences at the refuge, though Carter Pope, who was one of the main cooks for the protest, was not arrested or charged. During the second week of the protest, Lequieu told the Guardian that he works for a hauling company and that he was prepared to stay at the occupation for a long period, though would eventually have to go back to work. He left the site after numerous protesters were arrested and Oregon police shot and killed LaVoy Finicum, a major occupation spokesman. Angie Bundy, Ryan\u2019s wife, said she was surprised to see a defendant had pleaded guilty \u2013 noting that her husband and their supporters feel strongly that they are innocent. \u201cHe\u2019s not guilty of any crime. He didn\u2019t do damage to anybody.\u201d She added, \u201cMy husband\u2019s standing on principle. He\u2019s looking at the larger picture. ... He\u2019s not going to plead guilty.\u201d  Carter Pope noted that as part of the plea deal, Lequieu has made clear that he is not cooperating with prosecutors. \u201cThere\u2019s no way he would\u2019ve cooperated. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to think he\u2019s a snitch. He\u2019s not.\u201d  Lequieu will also have to pay restitution to the government and will remain in custody prior to a 25 August sentencing.",
