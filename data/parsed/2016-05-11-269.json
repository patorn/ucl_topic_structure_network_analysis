But five months after floods destroyed one of Cumbria\u2019s key thoroughfares, the road between Grasmere and Keswick finally reopened on Wednesday. That it took so long to repair the A591 after December\u2019s Storm Desmond is seen by many in the Lake District as a sign of the government\u2019s lack of interest in the north of England, despite its claim to want to build a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d.   Related: Cumbria rebuilds after the flooding \u2013 a photo essay    The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, a Lakeland MP, has pointed out that when storms destroyed a railway line in Dawlish in Dorset in 2014, the government \u2013 of which his party was then a part \u2013 provided a team of 300 and a budget of \u00a335m to get the line reopened in just over 50 days. In contrast, the slow repair works on the A591 have been paid for out of a \u00a340m fund for rebuilding all local transport infrastructure in flood-affected areas of both Cumbria and Lancashire. Cumbria county council said the cost of the A591 repairs was \u201cin the region\u201d of \u00a34m. Farron has claimed the road closure was costing the Lake District \u00a31m a day. It turned an easy 20-minute, 14-mile journey via Thirlmere reservoir into a hair-raising 36-mile adventure via the Kirkstone Pass, which closes in poor weather and is so steep it is nicknamed \u201cthe Struggle\u201d.

Becky Heaton Cooper, director of the Heaton Cooper Studio art gallery and shop, said her takings had been 60% down on the previous year. \u201cThe effect of the road closure has been absolutely horrendous, absolutely detrimental, worse than foot and mouth,\u201d she said, referring to the animal health crisis in 2001 which led to tens of thousands of sheep and cattle being destroyed and whole regions declared no-go zones. \u201cIn December, January and February half term we were 60% down.\u201d She had allowed one family from the other side of Thirlmere the use of her holiday let in Grasmere, so that their little girl could attend school. Heaton Cooper added: \u201cI think there has been a feeling down in London of, \u2018Oh, it doesn\u2019t really matter because it\u2019s just Cumbria\u2019.\u201d On the other side of Helvellyn, in Glenridding by Ullswater, frustrations remain that the village is still not fully back to normal after December\u2019s storms.     The Glenridding hotel is expected to be closed for the summer season. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    The sailing centre has recently reopened, along with most B&Bs, cafes and shops. A new 20-mile walking route, the Ullswater Way, circumnavigating the lake, has been completed too. But the beck, which burst its banks, catapulting rocks through the visitor centre and flooding everything in its wake, is still under repair. \u201cWork only started three or four weeks ago because of red tape and bullshit,\u201d according to the parish councillor Rob Shepherd, who coordinated the clear-up effort. The Glenridding hotel, where guests were stranded during Storm Desmond, is now not scheduled to reopen until September, missing the key summer season. And the mini-mart remains a shell of its former self, with building work yet to begin. A particular bugbear is a huge heap of rubble from the beck plonked right on the shores of Ullswater, which remains under constant guard by an Environment Agency official. Local people want to clear the eyesore but the agency has refused, saying it is awaiting a consultancy report to show whether the 15,000 tonnes of silt and gravel stored on Jenkins Field is contaminated from a tin mine up on the slopes.     Rubble at Glenridding. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Dale Gibbons, an Environment Agency official, said: \u201cThis gravel was removed to protect people\u2019s lives and livelihoods during the recent flooding. A decision on the future use or disposal of the material stored on Jenkins Field will be informed by the recommendations of an independent assessment commissioned by the Environment Agency.\u201d But the excuses do not wash with many local people. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for the situation with Jenkins Field. It\u2019s just idiot bureaucrats unwilling to make a decision,\u201d said Shepherd. \u201cI worry that an awful lot of money that\u2019s been promised by the government will just disappear into a hi-vis, yellow-jacketed black hole of nonsense.\u201d",
