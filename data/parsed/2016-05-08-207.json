  "body": "\u201cThere\u2019s a great book in this upheaval, and she\u2019d be the ideal chronicler of the times. She\u2019s always had the eye. For most people, what lies outside our front door is tragedy. For Enola, it\u2019s material.\u201d So says 99-year-old Douglas Mandible, patriarch of the titular family in Lionel Shriver\u2019s 13th novel. He\u2019s speaking in 2031 of his daughter, Nollie, a former bestselling author back in the days when people still paid for books, but his words could apply equally well to their creator. Shriver too has always had the eye \u2013 an unflinching gaze trained on aspects of contemporary American life most of us prefer not to look at for too long, from teenage violence in We Need to Talk About Kevin to the obesity crisis in Big Brother, by way of the US healthcare system in So Much for That. With The Mandibles: A Family 2029-2047, she turns that unsparing focus on the economy, following the present precariousness of the global markets to its logical conclusion \u2013 a near future in which the dollar collapses, America is relegated from superpower to pariah state, and civilisation all but breaks down.   Related: Lionel Shriver: time to talk about  her big brother | Observer profile    Through the four generations of the Mandible family (their curious name carrying connotations of being chewed up), she explores what financial ruin looks like to those who have the most to lose from it. In 2029 \u2013 a century on from the first Great Depression \u2013 Douglas is sitting pretty in\u00a0his plush care home on a family fortune built two generations earlier from the manufacture of diesel engines. Though the rest of the family see little trickle-down \u2013 a source of great resentment to Douglas\u2019s son, Carter, who is pushing 70 and still waiting for his inheritance \u2013 they live comfortably in the expectation of financial security. It turns out there is no such thing. As the dollar crashes, it is replaced by a new reserve currency, the bancor (an international monetary unit originally proposed by John Maynard Keynes), administered by a Russian- and Chinese-led consortium of countries that pointedly does not include the US. Some smell an \u201corganised fiscal coup\u201d \u2013 the words of Dante Alvarado, America\u2019s first Latino president, whose response is to lock down his country in a state of \u201cfiscal warfare\u201d. All gold reserves, down to wedding rings, are forfeit to the government. Hiding gold becomes treason. So does owning bancors. No\u00a0one can leave the country with more than $100 in cash. Most significantly, the president declares a \u201creset\u201d on the national debt, rendering all treasury bonds void. The Mandible fortune is wiped out at a stroke.    Teenagers in 2029 are called Goog and Fifa; there are fleeting references to \u201cEd Balls\u2019s government\u201d    If the novel is initially slow to gather momentum, it\u2019s because the set-up it requires is so complex, and because Shriver\u2019s research is so exhaustive. Thus the reader is fed tranches of economic theory in the early chapters, made scarcely more palatable for being dressed up as dinner-party conversations. Carter\u2019s self-important son-in-law, Lowell, is a tenured professor of economics, which allows him to hold forth authoritatively on the background to the crash (though, ironically, he discovers that his job is among the most dispensable as the economy implodes). But once the premise has been established as all too chillingly plausible, the novel revs up into a multifaceted family saga where marital, sibling and inter-generational relationships fracture in the face of increasingly punitive sanctions and shortages. The characters\u2019 middle-class assumptions crumble as life is stripped down to a matter of mere survival: a college degree in design or music becomes an unimaginable luxury (Lowell\u2019s 17-year-old daughter turns instead to prostitution) and they look back with incredulity on a world where people had the leisure and means to indulge affectations. Shriver presents this future with her familiar undercurrent of black humour and a sly nod to the reader; having gone to so much trouble to make the story\u2019s economic foundation solid, she also reminds us now and again of its artifice. \u201cPlots set in the future are about what people fear in the present. They\u2019re not about the future at all,\u201d Lowell pompously tells his daughter. \u201cThe truth is, throughout\u00a0history things keep getting better\u2026 But writers and film-makers keep predicting that everything\u2019s going to fall apart. It\u2019s almost funny,\u201d he adds, right before everything falls apart. She also has fun with the tropes of speculative fiction. Teenagers in 2029 are called Goog and Fifa; there are fleeting references to \u201cEd Balls\u2019s government\u201d and, later, the \u201cChelsea Clinton administration\u201d; and slang has evolved, so that by 2047 the word bullshit has been replaced by treasury, as in: \u201cYou\u2019re talking treasury, kid.\u201d But for all the sharp-edged comedy (a thriving Mexico builds a border wall to keep out desperate illegal Americans), and for all that it ends with a knowing Orwellian wink, The Mandibles is a profoundly frightening portrait of how quickly the agreed rules of society can fall apart without money to grease the wheels.
