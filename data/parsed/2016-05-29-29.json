  "body": "Lewis Hamilton hugged his Mercedes rival Nico Rosberg and thanked him for \u201cbeing a gentleman\u201d after he won the Monaco Grand Prix, his first success since October last year. An ecstatic Hamilton, who cut Rosberg\u2019s lead in the championship from 43 points to 24, started third on the grid but went past his slower team-mate after the German was instructed to let him by. Hamilton said: \u201cI came here today thinking: \u2018I have just got to go and do it,\u2019 because no one is going to give it to me. I didn\u2019t know whether I could win, but knowing that it would rain opened up the window of opportunity. I thought Nico had a problem. I knew when I was behind him that I was much, much quicker than him. I was also conscious that none of us are going to win this race if I am stuck behind. \u201cWhen the team ask you to push and you are not able to and it is hindering the team\u2019s chance of winning we have that agreement. I said thanks for being a gentleman.\u201d   Related: Lewis Hamilton gets his first F1 victory of season at Monaco Grand Prix    Rosberg, asked if it was a painful decision to give way to his only serious title rival, said: \u201cIt was more painful the feeling that I had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that\u2019s not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [team order] was just a consequence of that.\u201d A relieved Toto Wolff, the Mercedes motorsport director, said: \u201cIf I wore a red cap like Niki Lauda I would take it off to Nico. He gave up his place and understood our global position, and that showed a great sense of team work. \u201cThese last couple of weeks have strengthened Lewis and our relationship. This is just what the doctor ordered. He needed that win, we needed that win. We told Nico to up the pace and if not let Lewis by. Then we gave him the call of letting him by and he did it immediately. Not one single question. For Nico it was a messy day. All his bad luck came in one race.\u201d A bitterly disappointed Daniel Ricciardo, who was robbed of a victory because of a bad Red Bull pit-stop after starting on pole, said: \u201cTwo weekends in a row now I\u2019ve been screwed. It sucks. It hurts. We had the speed in the wet. At the start we pulled away, pitted for inters, and we put ourselves in a race with Lewis which we didn\u2019t need to be in. \u201cI felt I was the quickest in all conditions, but again, second place doesn\u2019t show much for it. I don\u2019t like being up here being miserable \u2013 when it happens two races in a row, it\u2019s hard not to be.\u201d In the previous race, in Barcelona this month, Ricciardo was upset because in order to \u201ccover\u201d Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel he was placed on a three-stop strategy \u2013 his team-mate Max Verstappen won the race with a two-stopper.",
