  "body": "The final set of films in the Guardian\u2019s Shakespeare Solos series has been released. The five videos feature outstanding actors performing some of the playwright\u2019s best known speeches. Damian Lewis delivers the funeral oration from Julius Caesar, Zawe Ashton gives the \u201cseven ages of man\u201d speech from As You Like It, Riz Ahmed plays Edmund in King Lear, Laura Carmichael is Portia from The Merchant of Venice and Paterson Joseph portrays Shylock. Lewis\u2019s film marks a return to his Shakespearean roots. In his 20s, he performed with the RSC; played Romeo at Birmingham Rep and Hamlet at the Regent\u2019s Park Open Air theatre; and was Laertes opposite Ralph Fiennes\u2019s Hamlet at the Almeida and on Broadway. For his solo, Lewis \u2013 who is soon to be seen in the John Le Carr\u00e9 thriller Our Kind of Traitor \u2013 was asked to give the \u201cFriends, Romans, countrymen\u201d speech, in which Antony skilfully turns the crowd at Caesar\u2019s funeral against the conspirators.            Damian Lewis as Antony in Julius Caesar: \u2018Friends, Romans, countrymen\u2019    Lewis\u2019s electric take on Antony\u2019s rhetoric was filmed at the Guardian\u2019s multimedia studio. Zawe Ashton\u2019s solo was shot on location in east London. Ashton was \u201csurprised but thrilled\u201d when we asked her to perform \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage\u201d, the famous speech given by the melancholic lord Jaques in As You Like It. \u201cI wanted to be able to connect to a slightly more sombre tone than it has been played with before,\u201d she said. \u201cI love that speech \u2026 Obviously, it\u2019s famously spoken by a man, but like many people nowadays, I\u2019m up for reinterpretation of Shakespearean roles. I was psyched that you had given me that and not one of the girly ones.\u201d   Related: Shakespeare Solos: watch the second set of films    Ashton, who has been an actor since childhood, said that the speech felt particularly pertinent to her. \u201cI\u2019m attempting to write a book exploring female identity through the microcosm of acting, so the notion of the whole world being a stage \u2013 and perceptions of performance and reality becoming tangled \u2013 is very close to home for me.\u201d Ashton\u2019s father, an English teacher, introduced her to Shakespeare by quoting his plays around the house. \u201cAs a child, I loved to talk about how I was feeling,\u201d she added. \u201cMy friends used to joke that they could do without the narration! That\u2019s what Shakespeare\u2019s characters do. What is amazing about his characters is how they are saying how they feel in the moment, driving home the big themes of love, death, betrayal, murder, madness, lust and jealousy.\u201d           Zawe Ashton as Jaques in As You Like It: \u2018All the world\u2019s a stage\u2019    It\u2019s nine years since Ashton played Bianca in Othello at the Globe. Which other Shakespearean roles would she like to take on? \u201cI\u2019d love to be original and not say Lady Macbeth but I have to say it! I feel there is such amazing scope for interpretation within her. I\u2019ve seen the play a number of times and am still searching for some different colours within her. I really would like to do a production that draws out the notion of a grieving woman \u2026 I\u2019ve seen a number of productions that have weighted her too much in the femme fatale way, when actually I think she\u2019s struggling with her own demons.\u201d Ashton is currently starring in a London revival of Jean Genet\u2019s The Maids alongside Laura Carmichael, who was cast as Portia from The Merchant of Venice for her solo. Carmichael has previously performed few Shakespearean roles. She had been offered the role of Viola in a production of Twelfth Night when she landed the part of Lady Edith Crawley in Downton Abbey, in which she starred for five years.           Laura Carmichael as Portia: \u2018The quality of mercy\u2019    Carmichael describes the playwright\u2019s work as a \u201cgoldmine\u201d for actors. For her solo, she performs the \u201cquality of mercy\u201d speech from The Merchant of Venice, in which Portia \u2013 disguised as a lawyer \u2013 tries to talk Shylock into sparing Antonio\u2019s life. \u201cI always find it so moving,\u201d she said, \u201chow impassioned she is at this point and how high the stakes are in the play. \u2026 But it\u2019s said in a very matter-of-fact, balanced, law-like way.\u201d Carmichael became interested in Shakespeare while studying at a sixth-form college in Winchester. She remembered: \u201cWinchester College was just up the road. They needed girls for their plays and it really was a turning point for me \u2026 We did Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost. A handful of us girls went up the road to the posh boys\u2019 school, doing Shakespeare and walking around their incredible grounds \u2026 We were all 16 and having a wonderful time, falling in love with Shakespeare and each other.\u201d            Paterson Joseph as Shylock: \u2018You call me misbeliever\u2019    For his solo, Paterson Joseph chose a speech by Shylock that he learned as a teenager when he auditioned for the National Youth Theatre. \u201cA friend of mine was applying,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been very good academically but I knew I could act \u2026 I was just basically following him \u2026 I was sent to a teacher for help and she slid a copy of The Merchant of Venice across the table and said to find a speech in that \u2026 And that was it! I had never been taught Shakespeare, never really heard it said aloud, it was the first play I\u2019d ever looked at, and I thought I should read it out loud \u2026 I was so inarticulate: I had such great thoughts and couldn\u2019t quite speak them out loud, like a lot of kids. So I was quite quiet and a bit of a mumbler. This power that I had in my mouth suddenly was like fizzy sherbet \u2013 it suddenly felt like my mouth was moving in ways I didn\u2019t know it could do. My tongue was having to do acrobatics. That was my first love \u2013 even though I didn\u2019t get into the National Youth Theatre because I was painfully shy in my interview. But it helped me realise I could do this.\u201d For Joseph, Shylock\u2019s \u201cmany a time and oft\u201d speech contains all of the character\u2019s \u201cwiliness, his bitterness, his pain\u201d. The actor added: \u201cThis whole debate about diversity should come down to diversity of the imagination, as Idris Elba so eloquently put it ... My imagination said that it\u2019s possible for a black man to play Shylock, I just don\u2019t know the circumstances. In the 80s, Jews from Ethiopia moved to Israel and I suddenly thought, \u2018Wow you could have an Ethiopian Jew.\u2019 And the latest flash of inspiration came when I had just finished doing Julius Caesar at the RSC in an African version and [the director] Gregory Doran said that Julius Nyerere, the first president of Tanzania, had translated Julius Caesar into Swahili and had also translated The Merchant of Venice. So I did a workshop around Nyerere\u2019s Merchant. We set it in Tanzania. Hopefully a version of it might be around the corner.\u201d           Riz Ahmed as Edmund in King Lear: \u2018Now, gods, stand up for bastards\u2019    Like Joseph, the actor and rapper Riz Ahmed chose a former drama-school audition speech for his solo. He performs Edmund\u2019s soliloquy \u201cThou, nature, art my goddess\u201d from King Lear. \u201cThe course that I got into off the back of that speech was an MA in classical acting at Central School of Speech and Drama,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cIt was basically just a year of Shakespeare. So all my training is Shakespeare and it\u2019s been strange for me that I\u2019ve almost never had the opportunity to do any Shakespeare since I started working professionally as an actor.\u201d Ahmed, whose films include Chris Morris\u2019s Four Lions and Mira Nair\u2019s The Reluctant Fundamentalist, is currently developing a new screen version of Hamlet.  In the soliloquy, spoken upon his entrance in the second scene of King Lear, Edmund reflects upon being an illegitimate son. Ahmed said that he has \u201calways felt like a bit of an outsider to the industry. I think a lot of actors of colour do. One of the reasons why this speech really resonates for me is that it speaks to that issue, in my mind, of feeling like an outsider. You know, here we are, the bastard children of modern Britain. You\u2019re not quite fully accepted into the family, into the nation\u2019s self-image. And there\u2019s a heartbreak around that feeling, an anger. It\u2019s similar to feeling like a jilted lover or something. You have a right to be in the room, to be on that stage, to partake, but by dint of your birth you\u2019re kind of excluded. You\u2019re not considered to be the proper thing.\u201d Ahmed performs the speech sitting alone in a cinema, reflecting upon the image of itself that Britain exports through its films. \u201cI wanted to allow that kind of symbolism to play out. That feeling of sitting there, watching film after film, going: \u2018They really don\u2019t want us.\u2019 People ask me a lot about diversity in film and TV and this whole debate. In a way, that speech is my two cents.\u201d    Related: Shakespeare Solos: watch the first six films    All of the Shakespeare Solos are directed by the Guardian\u2019s Dan Susman, who commented: \u201cIt\u2019s been a great privilege to work with such terrifically talented actors. Shakespeare mastered so many distinct characters, from lovestruck adolescent to twisted psychopath, so we wanted each film to have a distinct voice and feel. But we also wanted to keep things simple to let the language and the characters speak for themselves. So we tried to do subtle things that would only be noticed unconsciously. For example, we used a wide-angle lens, but very close, for Paterson Joseph as Shylock, to emphasise the distortion of the shifting of his power.\u201d  The Shakespeare Solos project marks the 400th anniversary of the playwright\u2019s death. A selection of the films will be broadcast in cinemas this summer before productions from Shakespeare\u2019s Globe as part of Globe On Screen.
