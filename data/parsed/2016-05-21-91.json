  "body": "Somebody Stop Ivy Pocket is Ivy Pocket\u2019s second adventure. She now lives with a pair of coffin makers who treat her like a maid. But then she discovers a way of using the Clock Diamond (a priceless diamond necklace that came into Ivy\u2019s possession in the first book) to reach her friend, who is trapped in another world!  While all this is happening, Estelle Dumbleby asks Ivy to help her find her missing brother, Sebastian. Will Ivy be able to solve her friend\u2019s troubles, as well as her own? I like this book because it is very funny and exciting. The best bit is a surprise discovery Ivy makes near the end of the book, but I can\u2019t reveal that or it will spoil it!       I love how rude Ivy is and the way she speaks. I can\u2019t wait for the third book to come out!  Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop  Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read?
