  "body": "Nelson Rosada has been a chef for 28 years. He takes pride in having crafted many extraordinary dishes. But, he claims, none have been as special as the food he now serves daily at the Caribe Hilton Hotel, on the north-east coast of Puerto Rico.   Related: Caribbean neighbors Cuba and Puerto Rico wonder who really won cold war    The reason, he says, is that for the first time the ingredients he uses are fresh, grown and harvested locally instead of arriving \u2013 many days old \u2013 on a boat from Florida.  This might appear a small victory for one sous chef catering mostly to tourists, but it is indicative of a revival in agriculture in the US territory that offers, some believe, one potential solution to the $73bn debt crisis currently gripping the island. \u201cWe have a beautiful island and a perfect climate, we can produce whatever we want,\u201d Rosado says of the boxes of lettuces, beans, peppers, herbs and other vegetables delivered daily by a farmer-run cooperative based close to San Juan, the capital city.  \u201cIts taste, the smell, the freshness and the crunch, you can\u2019t even believe we can produce this quality of food.  \u201cBut to see our island growing again in this way is cool, it\u2019s nice, we have something going here. It keeps dollars in Puerto Rico. I\u2019m very proud that we\u2019re working and supporting Puerto Rico.\u201d The headline figures of the century-long decline of Puerto Rican agriculture are depressing. In 1914, revenue from farming, food production and related activities accounted for 70% of the island\u2019s gross domestic product. According to the most recent statistics from the US Census of Agriculture, it now accounts for less than 1%. Furthermore, the loss to development of more than a million acres of prime farmland and the collapse of the sugar industry robbed Puerto Rico of vital income. Self-sufficiency declined to the point where the island imports up to 85% of the food it consumes \u2013 a \u201ccritical situation\u201d, in the words of Dr Myrna Comas Pag\u00e1n, secretary of the island\u2019s department of agriculture. However, thanks to a growth in demand for locally grown produce, financial incentives from the federal government and renewed focus on agriculture from local leaders, more families are returning to the land. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), more than 1,700 new farms have begun operations. Farmers, food distributors, politicians and analysts increasingly believe that Puerto Rico can grow its way out of trouble. \u2018We\u2019re planting the seeds to bring foods for the future\u2019   Related: Puerto Rico woos US investors with huge tax breaks as locals fund debt crisis    \u201cIt\u2019s about recovering our lands and changing the culture of our people to make agriculture a way of life,\u201d Dr Comas Pag\u00e1n told the Guardian, pointing to a recent reclamation of 30,000 abandoned arable acres that lifted land available for growing to 637,000 acres, the first such increase in decades. \u201cSome of it will take time. For example, we\u2019ve established 8,000 [new] acres for avocado and 8,000 acres for coffee that we can\u2019t see for three years. But we\u2019re planting the seeds to bring food for the future.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing new farmers, new technology, new farms. Already our agricultural income has increased since 2011 by 24% to more than $900m.\u201d On a hillside near Caguas, about 20 miles south of San Juan\u2019s old town, brothers Pedro and Jorge Casas work in two giant greenhouses, tending crops of organic mint, chives, rosemary and basil. The farm was remodelled last year, in part through a $280,000 loan from the Farm Service Agency of USDA. The physical footprint of the Agroponicos Cosecha farm is small, because no land or soil is required to grow. Instead, the tightly packed plants\u2019 roots receive nutrition from a constant flow of water filtered in three large tanks full of tilapia fish. Since 2011 the brothers, who had no previous experience of farming, have harvested and sold increasingly large yields. The entrepreneurs have also set up an expanding distribution network, to serve themselves and dozens of other farmers around the island and to help drive the food revolution. \u201cEverything is local,\u201d said Jorge Casas, 31. \u201cThe point of everything is to grow the agriculture on the island and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to help the economy of the island. \u201cThe farmers usually don\u2019t like to go out and sell, so we\u2019re creating this community of \u2018You grow, I sell\u2019. You grow what you\u2019re expert in, we grow what we are expert in, and let\u2019s join it all together and sell it.    You grow what you\u2019re expert in, we grow what we are expert in, and let\u2019s join it all together and sell it  Jorge Casas, farmer     \u201cWe\u2019re working with more than 80 farms in food service, and hotels and restaurants are the main goal. Almost everything we have is sold with these clients, we\u2019re not even in the supermarkets.\u201d The knock-on effect is more jobs, a welcome development on an island where according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics the unemployment rate is a highest-in-the-nation 11.7%, more than twice the US average of 5%.  With the farming boom come more farm labourers, drivers and retail workers, and urban produce markets are opening up across Puerto Rico. One such, O-Mrkt in the San Juan suburbs, opened in April with the Casas brothers as partners. \u201cWe need to grow food,\u201d said Pedro Casas, who was formerly a web graphics designer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how but we need to grow it. If we don\u2019t teach our kids these things you don\u2019t turn that spark on. Education about agriculture was and still is very low on the island, we need to get into the schools.\u201d     Tara Rodr\u00edguez runs an organic cafe-restaurant and produce market in old San Juan. Photograph: Richard Luscombe for the Guardian    Tara Rodr\u00edguez Besosa is another young entrepreneur who has recently moved her organic cafe-restaurant and produce market, El Departamento de la Comida (the Ministry of Food), out of a warehouse in old San Juan and to a larger site in Santa Teresita, a suburb in the east of the city. From small beginnings and a $10,000 loan from a friend, in 2010, she has built the business into a flourishing community hub, focused exclusively on locally grown produce and sustainable farming. \u201cI got to know all these amazing farmers, and wondered how people get to know about them and have access to these products if you\u2019re not up at 8am on a Sunday for a farmer\u2019s market,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez, 31.  \u201cWe\u2019re creating demand. We have this pool of buyers, a pool of farmers and we\u2019re bringing them together. Food is my bet on how to change this island, if not the world. Food has the power to change everything from economy to education to health to environment, you name it. I feel we\u2019re on the verge of something with this island.\u201d \u2018Farmers have iPads, there are drones to monitor crops\u2019 Many of Puerto Rico\u2019s new generation of innovators and thinkers are gathering in San Juan this weekend for Agrohack, a specialist conference that will bring together for the first time the island\u2019s food growers, sellers, chefs and consumers. Much of the focus will be on \u201cgreen\u201d farming and new technology solutions that Carlos Cobi\u00e1n, the event\u2019s founder, says will transform the island\u2019s agricultural industry into an unrecognisable incarnation of its former self, with better energy and land efficiency and lower costs. \u201cYou think of agriculture in Puerto Rico and the first image that comes to mind is an old jibarito in a straw hat walking the field slowly with his two bulls,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the landscape is different now. Farmers have iPads, there are drones to monitor crops and spread seeds, they\u2019re taking old warehouses and turning them into aquaponics and vertical farming.    Food is my bet on how to change this island, if not the world. Food has the power to change everything  Tara Rodr\u00edguez Besosa, entrepreneur     \u201cWith the internet and education in agribusiness it\u2019s not only about the farmer, it\u2019s about people that export, it\u2019s branding, marketing, gaining value from the product. We\u2019re bringing together people with ideas, experience and innovation, the hackers, inventors, hustlers and business people who identify Puerto Rico\u2019s problems and find the solutions.\u201d Despite the progress, and almost $60m from USDA to support agricultural programmes, the headwinds remain strong. The island\u2019s vulnerability was exposed last summer when drought led to widespread crop failure and an emergency declaration in 10 counties. Still, Dr Comas Pag\u00e1n was upbeat.  \u201cWith the technology we have we can aim to produce 40% of our local consumption,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a crisis so we need to be efficient and contribute to our economic and labour development by creating agricultural jobs. People want to work.  \u201cI\u2019m excited because we\u2019re looking at a revival of agriculture, young people considering it as a way of life.\u201d",
