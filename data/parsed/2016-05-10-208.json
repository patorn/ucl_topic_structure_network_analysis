  "body": "I am Eritrean but I was born in Sudan. The place I call home is Columbus, Ohio. Aside from what my parents have told me about Eritrea, I don\u2019t know it. Sudan was the country my parents lived in as refugees during Eritrea\u2019s struggle for independence. Columbus, Ohio, is where we were resettled in 1984 after Sudan began its civil war. All three places have shaped the person that I am but it has taken half my life for me to realize that.  I started kindergarten in the fall of 1985. I didn\u2019t go to my neighborhood like the other children, I went to a school that was a half an hour away. Ohio was one of the states that had agreed to resettle refugees and ESL programs were only offered at two elementary schools. My classmates included children from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. We spent half the day in the regular classes and the other half in ESL. Although I shared a lot of similarities with the other children in the ESL classes I didn\u2019t like being separated from my classmates. After two years of ESL, I moved to a neighborhood school.  I remember the day my second-grade teacher formally introduced me to the class. She said: \u201cWe have a student from Sudan in our class, Rishan can you tell us a little about your country?\u201d To which I replied: \u201cI\u2019m not from Sudan\u201d. My teacher said \u201cThat\u2019s what your documents say\u201d. I explained to her that I was born there but that it wasn\u2019t where I am from. \u201cI am from Eritrea,\u201d I said proudly. My teacher pulled down the map and asked me to point it out. I couldn\u2019t find my country on the map because it hadn\u2019t yet gained independence. I pointed to the northern highlands of Ethiopia and said \u201cThis is where my country is supposed to be\u201d. My teacher said, \u201cSo you\u2019re from Ethiopia?\u201d to which I replied \u201cNo, I\u2019m from Eritrea.\u201d  Sensing that I was adamant, my teacher asked what language I spoke. I told her I spoke Tigriniya and she asked me to teach the class a couple of words. She turned to the class and asked if they had any questions. \u201cWhat kind of food do you eat?\u201d \u201cHave you ever ridden on a camel?\u201d \u201cHow do you say my name in your language?\u201d they asked. As I answered their questions, I heard a couple of students giggling. My teacher asked the students giggling if they had something to say. \u201cWere you in the Michael Jackson video?\u201d Not sure what they referring to, I turned to my teacher for clarification. \u201cYou know, the video with Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, were you one of those children in that video?\u201d Suddenly, I realized they were talking about the We Are the World video that showed images of drought and famine in Ethiopia and I burst into tears. What I didn\u2019t realize is that before meeting me, my classmates associated Africa with images of starving children.  As a child, you want to be accepted and you don\u2019t want to be different. Even though my features and name were a giveaway, I tried my hardest to be like the American kids. I stopped letting my mother braid my hair in traditional styles and I wanted to be called Rachel. When people asked me questions about my ethnicity, I crafted the perfect answers.  \u201cWhat are you?\u201d they would ask.  \u201cA person,\u201d I would reply.  \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m from my mother\u2019s stomach.\u201d  \u201cBut where were you born?\u201d  \u201cIn a hospital,\u201d I would say.  At home, my parents reminded me every day that I was Eritrean. They insisted that we only spoke Tigriniya in the house and we only ate our traditional food. When my friends at school talked about spending the weekend at the mall, I didn\u2019t share with them that my Saturday was spent at Tigrinya school.    Related: I was a Soviet defector. Chess was my door to freedom | Lev Alburt    My parents wouldn\u2019t let me go to football games and homecoming dances as they felt a child didn\u2019t need a social life. Unless there was an academic element to it, I wasn\u2019t allowed to participate in extracurricular activities. This caused a lot of inner turmoil. I had never lived in my country and I only knew what my parents told me about it. I was an American, but I was constantly made to feel that I wasn\u2019t.  In college, I came to accept my dual identity. I learned to balance my Eritrean identity with my American identity and I was able to shift seamlessly between both worlds. I graduated with a degree in English literature with a minor in international studies focusing on north Africa and the Middle East.  Today I live in Alexandria, Virginia, and I work as an adult ESL teacher in a small language program. Most of my students are refugees from Eritrea, Congo, Iraq and Afghanistan. As I listen to their stories, they are all too familiar to me. I serve as a beacon of hope to my students. They realize that I am like their children and by coming to America they have given their children an opportunity to succeed. And I realize that the refugee in me with always be with me.
