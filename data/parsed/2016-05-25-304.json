Why can\u2019t I wear skirts to school like all the other girls? Why do I have short hair?\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI wanted to be the same like all the other girls. I always felt like a girl.\u201d Rattanarak is now 23, and is one of 24 Thai \u201cladyboy\u201d stars who have performed in Adelaide and Newcastle. Next stop: Sydney, for their sparkle-filled big top extravaganza called Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret. Audiences have been told that they will be \u201cleft in awe\u201d by the show, \u201cnot to mention infatuated with the many gender-straddling performers\u201d.    Related: \u2018They\u2019: the singular pronoun that could solve sexism in English    Asked if she considers herself to be a woman, Rattanarak says: \u201cWhen I was young I always thought I was a girl in the wrong body. Now I would say I belong to [a] third sex.\u201d This other gender \u2013 neither male or female \u2013 is increasingly finding acceptance in Thailand and beyond. Rattanarak says the term ladyboy does not equate to \u201cdrag queen\u201d. There is a performative aspect to the way drag artists use dressing up as the opposite sex (often in exaggerated tones), whereas being a ladyboy is a state of being, akin to transgenderism: \u201cWe are this way all the time.\u201d Nor is the term, necessarily, derogatory \u2013 although it may feel that way to a casual observer. Rattanarak says it depends on the intent with which the word is said. \u201cWe are happy for people to call us ladyboys, if they talk nice,\u201d she says. All the performers are proud of who they are and bring passion and integrity to their performances, she adds.

Photograph: Megan Garth    While Rattanarak has not undergone gender reassignment, \u201cmany change [sex] for relationships or to find a boyfriend easier \u2013 much easier than [when you are] a ladyboy\u201d. She has a boyfriend and says they are open about their relationship, although tend not to kiss in public. \u201cThai culture believes this is rude, no matter who you are.\u201d Thailand has long been a leader in progressive attitudes towards transgenderism and non-binary gender identities, however Rattanarak says this applies less in Thai workplaces where her community still struggles for acceptance. They are largely forced to find work in the entertainment and hair and beauty industries, and stories like the Thai airline company PC Air who publicly hired transgender flight attendants are exceptions to the rule.

It\u2019s very feminine, I feel more like a woman,\u201d she says. Her pre-show preparation requires 1.5 hours on makeup and another 30 minutes for costume and hair. Director of Thai Ladyboys, Damian Syred, says Sydney audiences should expect a show with plenty of razzle-dazzle. Two hundred costumes will be worn throughout, consisting, he says, of more than 100,000 feathers, 200,000 sequins and 350,000 diamantes. Sourcing well-fitting heels has proven one of the production\u2019s biggest challenges, with most of the performers requiring sizes larger than those conventionally offered in the ladies shoe department. \u201cThey also have to be a good fit for dancing so we get them custom-made.\u201d Production numbers span traditional and modern Thai songs, to western pop such as Kylie Minogue, Jennifer Lopez and crowd favourite Tina Turner. Syred says some of the performers have a special skill in impersonation. \u201cSometimes I am surprised at how quick they will pick up somebody\u2019s actions.\u201d     Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret will be held at the Entertainment Quarter, Moore Park in Sydney. Photograph: Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret    Syred says the production\u2019s title, Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret, was chosen in consultation with the performers, with the deliberate inclusion of the word ladyboy, \u201cso people know what it is and nobody ends up watching something they didn\u2019t want to be watching\u201d. Press material merrily describes the performers as \u201cthe world\u2019s most glamorous showgirls (who just happen to be men!)\u201d.  Australia lags behind Thailand in acceptance of transgenderism, says Syred, adding there\u2019s a \u201csmall percentage\u201d who continue to discriminate against the community. \u201cYou\u2019ll get the odd [negative] comment on our Facebook page,\u201d he says. But he believes local attitudes are improving. \u201cA show like this will help show that there\u2019s nothing untoward. They are just beautiful performers.\u201d  \u2022 Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret is at Sydney\u2019s Moore Park from 26 May to 19 June",
