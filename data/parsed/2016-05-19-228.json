  "body": "About a year ago, I was standing on the south side of Chicago chatting with the mother of Rekia Boyd, the young woman who was shot in the head by an off-duty cop in 2012, while protesters yards away called for his firing.  While the \u201cSay her name!\u201d chant began to echo into the spring night, Boyd\u2019s mother, Angela Helton, pointed to the T-shirts most protesters were wearing: they had Boyd\u2019s face ironed on to them. She wasn\u2019t wearing one.  \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to mourn my daughter when her face is everywhere,\u201d she told me, looking on from a short distance away. As the movement to end police violence has raged over the past few years, even as the drumbeat of police violence goes on, faces co-opted as symbols for the cause continue to spring up: Mike Brown, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice.   Related: Black culture isn't the problem - systemic inequality is | Boots Riley    But each of these faces has relatives, most often mothers, who are expected to stand in front of cameras, defending and lamenting the life of the loved one that was ripped away from them. And they are expected to not only be in the public eye, but also to mourn in it. Here in Chicago, the mother in mourning is almost a daily sight \u2013 there have been over 1,000 shootings so far this year (most of which were not police shootings). Just the other day I stood on the west side of Chicago and watched the mother of Pierre Loury visit the place where her 16-year-old son was shot by police last month. The next day, the image of her face awash with grief was splashed across new sites. Activists and organizers have consistently told me that they deliberately use maternal grief as a symbol \u2013 that using moments of pain expressed in the hours after a body is pulled off a street is crucial to the movement, because it gives a face to the suffering that is often ignored by the society at large. Even at the scene of Loury\u2019s death, I watched a man yell at people when they\u2019d accidentally block television crews, saying: Let the press see her pain! Let the city see her pain! This may indeed be imagery that helps end violence \u2013 or it may just fetishize the mourners for an audience that will largely never know what it\u2019s like to be a black mother losing her child.  Either way, using someone\u2019s grief to further a cause risks leaving the wellbeing of mourners behind, and I\u2019ve found through these past years of reporting that the most empowering thing they can do, after being expected to mourn publicly, is to heal publicly, too. Lezley McSpadden, the mother of Mike Brown, decided that part of that ongoing process would be to release a stunning memoir about her son. Tell the Truth & Shame the Devil came out last week. \u201cWhen something bad happens \u2013 I mean really bad \u2013 you find yourself trying to put it all in some order, make it make sense,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut when it\u2019s something so messed up, sometimes it\u2019s like a million pieces of a puzzle scattered out in front of you. How are you supposed to put that together?\u201d   Related: We\u2019re in an amazing black cultural moment. Can we avoid the backlash? | Syreeta McFadden    Some, like Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin\u2019s mothers, have taken empowered action toward the world they want to see, vocally endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. (Garner\u2019s daughter, Erica Garner, endorsed Bernie Sanders.)  And all three women appeared in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album Lemonade, sitting regally in a plantation recast as a site to celebrate black lives instead of enslave them. It\u2019s imagery that, as many critics have pointed out, was not made to make white audiences comfortable, and in the words of colleague Syreeta McFadden are \u201ccrucial to resisting the old narratives that have been taught across generations\u201d.  Those old narratives give black lives less value than white ones, and it\u2019s possible to draw a fairly direct line from that ingrained norm to the racial discrepancy in police shooting victims. A refusal to play victim may seem to contradict the activist impulse to create sympathy for the victims by showcasing maternal grief. But it is also a refusal to accept a never-ending story where black deaths are an expected plot twist.",
