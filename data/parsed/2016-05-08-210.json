  "body": "Evening, Friday Dinner table, with extended family. You breathe out with the breath of a thousand potatoes, and prepare yourself for the traditional digestif: an elderly relative explaining why the Labour party is antisemitic. This is an argument that can be imposed on to any topic \u2013 Germany, the countryside, boating. But today it is the Labour party, and as usual you are arguing on the side of \u201cno\u201d, with your pleas to interrogate the source of the story, and to look at individuals rather than write off the whole of the party, or of Suffolk, or of the seas. But this is an unwinnable fight, because on their side they have memories of siblings being shuffled on to trains, and their homes being bombed, and with that comes the sureness that it is only a matter of time. So you settle into your ice cream and talk about Beyonc\u00e9 instead.    As they were crossing the road, the men at the tables started chanting: \u2018We hate Jews.\u2019 You say: I\u2019m calling the police    Midday, Saturday Driving through London on a warm afternoon, you\u2019re unaware of an anti-war demonstration happening near Hyde Park. \u201cBeep your horn!\u201d people shout, and you do. You hate war. Beep! You\u2019re crawling through the crowds, but it\u2019s fine, you hate war, and you\u2019ve texted your friend to say you\u2019ll be late. Then someone smacks your bonnet: \u201cBeep!\u201d You\u2019ve just beeped, but fine, beep. This group of people, though, their signs say \u201cBoycott Israel\u201d, so you try to avoid eye contact until you\u2019re alongside the less specific banners, even though they keep shouting through the window. If they look in your eyes, they might know. You\u2019re going to Israel for a family wedding soon. You\u2019ve bought a strappy dress. But you haven\u2019t told many people you\u2019re going, and you\u2019re not sure exactly why. You understand Israel as a home, and a holiday destination, and as a symbol. But you can keep those empathies in your head at the same time as this feeling of deep dread at the very bad things, and you can stare ahead through the windscreen with a sense of shallow apology, and you can pretend you haven\u2019t heard the shouting. Afternoon, July Your parents are leaving your flat, having come to visit your week-old child, her eyes just opening, her 6lb body more story than flesh. They call you from the car. Bit odd. Do you know the man who runs the caf\u00e9 downstairs? As they were crossing the road, the men at the tables started chanting: \u201cWe hate Jews.\u201d You say: I\u2019m calling the police. Please don\u2019t, say your parents. Let\u2019s not make a fuss. Your mum was irritated with herself. She wished that, instead of getting into the car she had told them about her new grandchild, and looked them in the eye and asked about their families, too. Morning, Passover A non-Jewish friend on the way to your family\u2019s seder remarks to a colleague that she didn\u2019t realise Peckham\u2019s Morrisons didn\u2019t have a kosher section. He replies: \u201cOf course not, they all live in north London.\u201d And later she tells you this, her eyebrows knotted, because she\u2019s realised how many times she hears this \u201cthey\u201d, this strange otherness discussed in throwaway euphemisms. Jokes about bagels. A friend\u2019s recurring screech: \u201cI\u2019m Jewish!\u201d upon receipt of the bill at dinner, despite it being a distant bloodline, and despite them being blonde. And while you quietly maintain a fraction of your elderly relatives\u2019 paranoia, you realise you live within clingfilm, protected enough that you don\u2019t have to debate your right to exist, or to hide. Occasionally the seal breaks. The internet, May You are wearily learning about how you are supposed to feel about antisemitism from a series of clever men whose foreskins, it\u2019s clear, have no bearing on their authority speaking on a subject which 0.5% of the UK navigate daily. You are seeing your experience used as a political grenade. And the worst thing about it, you think as you walk through the glittering of Britain in blossom season, is that your opinions (even yours, the opinions of a pork-eating God-sceptic, of a person only Jew-ish) are already assumed. When yours are firmly wobbly. It\u2019s not possible for you to support Israel uncritically, as your elderly relatives might. But it\u2019s uncomfortable to hear a non-Jew criticise it, in part because that criticism feels stained \u2013 with Yid chants, with the trick-or-treater\u2019s joke about Goldilocks and the big nose, with the swastika sprayed on your fence at night. You don\u2019t want to be forced to have an opinion. Because there is no room for nuance when you\u2019re pressed against the wall.
