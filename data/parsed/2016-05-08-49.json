  "body": "On a business estate in Devon, Jade sits at a computer screen and hovers her mouse over an innocent selfie of a young woman from Scotland. In a matter of seconds, she is led down the internet\u2019s tunnels and diversions deep into what was once the private world of the 21-year-old. As she follows the digital trail, scores of explicit, intimate pictures of the young woman appear, originally taken for a boyfriend but now traded as porn across the web. Below the images the comment \u201cMy sexy ex\u201d is followed by multiple lurid responses to the pictures. The phone rings beside her. Jade picks up. \u201cHello, Revenge Porn Helpline.\u201d For 14 months, staff on the Revenge Porn Helpline,  based in an office outside Exeter, have been listening to victims describe their experiences of a swiftly escalating pattern of online behaviour \u2013 the shaming of individuals by posting explicit and intimate pictures of them, often on multiple platforms. Since 1 April last year, after pressure from campaigners such as Laura Higgins, who created the helpline, it is a criminal offence to disclose private sexual photographs and films without the consent of the individual who appears in them and with intent to cause distress. Known as revenge porn, its victims are both female and male, young and middle-aged, from all ethnic backgrounds.  Higgins was one of the first to notice the emerging crime, after setting up a professional helpline for teachers and social workers in south-west England five years ago. \u201cWe had a school contact us about one of their teachers, pictures of her had gone viral and the kids were sharing them,\u201d said Higgins. \u201cThe school had suspended her, which we felt was a bit harsh. We asked them to get her to call us \u2026 she was distraught, absolutely in shock. She said she hadn\u2019t been able to bring herself to look. She asked us: \u2018Is it bad? How much is out there?\u2019 \u201cThere came a point when we realised that this was a real issue. There were so many victims but they did not know they were victims. They thought they were the only one.\u201d That could not have been further from the truth. Each victim was suffering a form of online abuse which has become a global phenomenon. When Higgins recently spoke about revenge porn at a UN conference, she was overwhelmed by how many countries were facing similar problems. \u201cIn Barbados they have a real problem, in China it is a problem \u2013 this is not just happening in the UK or in Europe, it is a global issue. What is empowering is that we are all now sharing our experiences of how best to tackle this together.\u201d In the UK, more than 3,700 victims have contacted the helpline in the past year, 400 alone between February and April 2016.  At least 12 sites actively promote themselves by encouraging men to post images of ex-wives and former girlfriends as porn to be viewed by others. One advertises itself as a forum to post images of \u201ccheating slut wives\u201d. Increasingly, however, revenge porn is being facilitated by a growing number of anonymous image boards with a heavy local focus \u2013 a type of site which began in Japan and was brought to the west by 4Chan.  While 4Chan itself does not host revenge porn, several spin-off sites do. Users of one such image board in Northamptonshire share explicit pictures of girls and women they know. \u201cIs there anywhere I can see some of [Girl X]? Been searching for this forever,\u201d a user asked recently. When he was told that the pictures had been removed because the girl was underage, he replied: \u201cShit. There\u2019s nowhere they\u2019re still up?\u201d Users share explicit pictures or details of nearly 40 women from the county. In some cases, semi-naked pictures had been stolen from the victims\u2019 Facebook profiles and posted to the revenge porn forum along with a request for more graphic photographs. \u201cShe used to sit next to me in class and talk all the time about her sex life. 100% there is win,\u201d read one comment, attached to three images of a teenage girl. In the forum\u2019s language, a \u201cwin\u201d is a fully-naked photograph. In another post, an anonymous user uploaded five explicit pictures of a girl claiming to be from her profile on the dating website OkCupid. The caption read: \u201cThese are from her okcupid and from reading that, win 100% exists. Seems like it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to get some either.\u201d Users post pictures of a woman or girl along with her first name and the first initial of her surname, plus sometimes the town she is from and other identifying details. Then that user either requests more images of the same person, or proposes a new target. As explained by one user: \u201cNo requests unless you provide a photo yourself. If you request a person, provide a photo of that person.\u201d It takes only a matter of minutes to link several of the girls to their Facebook profiles. Other identical forums exist around the UK: in Leeds, Sheffield, Bournemouth, Worthing, West Lothian, Swansea, Doncaster, Halifax and Sunderland. Worryingly for the authorities, it is almost impossible to discover who is behind the posts. Their identities are hidden and the forum is registered to an anonymous-looking building in an industrial estate in Toronto, Canada. Amanda Naylor, the senior manager for children and young people at the charity Victim Support, said the women named and pictured on the Northamptonshire message board were particularly at risk. \u201cOne of the things that really worried me about this site is that there were clearly some under-18s on there,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the comments said \u2018And this is her little friend\u2019 and that is a really clear paedophile type of comment we see on other sites. It\u2019s not just adult women this is affecting, it\u2019s vulnerable young women and some who could be under 18, which would be child sexual exploitation.\u201d Naylor said the risk to the women was heightened because the explicit pictures were posted by people known to the victims. Often by the time victims approach the Revenge Porn Helpline they are desperate. \u201cSometimes they have just found out or they have been suffering for months not knowing what to do,\u201d said Jade. \u201cThey might have been let down by the police and been trying to grasp for help for a long, long time. When they talk it comes out in a barrage of information. \u201cI had a lady in her 40s call who asked: \u2018Could you help? I\u2019m in trouble.\u2019 A man she had been having an affair with had posted pictures of her online and shared them on social media with her children, husband and family. The man was threatening to post more images of her. She told me she was sitting in bed with a bottle of vodka wanting to end it all.\u201d Staff encourage victims to report to the police and preserve evidence of what has happened. They also offer pro bono legal advice, but experiences of police responses are very mixed.  The law itself is flawed, campaigners believe, because it requires proof of intent to cause distress and does not cover Photoshopped images. The new legislation does not make the images themselves illegal and take-down requests to sites are made on the basis of a breach of copyright. Staff on the hotline help victims make take-down requests but it is slow, painstaking work and relies on the cooperation of whoever is running the site. \u201cIt\u2019s about telling the sites that the individual did not consent to share these images and they need to be taken down,\u201d said Jade. \u201cWe have built up relationships with some sites, and they are fantastic, they respond in 24 hours, others push back and don\u2019t respond. When it comes to image boards, we struggle.\u201d Almost 80% of callers to the hotline are women, and victims will call between one and 10 times for help. The helpline often receives calls from parents of young adults seeking help and describing their sense of powerlessness.  One father summed up the fears of many: \u201cMy daughter has been a victim of naked pictures being posted online and although we reported it to the police their attitude has been complacent and unsupportive and indeed caused her more distress. The \u2018nothing we can do, you shouldn\u2019t have taken the pictures in the first place\u2019 comments \u2026 have had a devastating effect on her,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pictures look like they were stolen. My problem is this: how do I help console her, what advice can I give her? My original advice to go the police has massively backfired and made the problem ten times worse.\u201d",
