There is another London: it\u2019s still there, holding out against the tabloid headlines, with its chicken shops, \u201ccontinental\u201d greengrocers, kebab spots and unreconstructed caffs. And this is it. Wedged between Croydon and Upper Norwood (so posh it likes to call itself Crystal Palace these days) is a huge, humdrum wodge of the capital. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t sublime spots: the Norwood Lakes, the restored pomp of the Stanley Halls. The unrelenting strips of pebbledash could get claustrophobic were it not for the geography, the landscape folding this way and that in the foothills of the alps of Crystal Palace. The case against Suburban claustrophobia. There are some rather gloomy patches and some of the housing can be a bit drab (lots of pebbledash; and I like pebbledash). Well connected? Trains: seven or eight an hour from Norwood Junction to London Bridge or London Victoria (17-34 mins). Overground: every 15 mins to Canada Water (23 mins) and Shoreditch (33 mins); or to West Croydon (five minutes). Harrington Road is on the Tramlink. Schools Primaries: Downsview, St Cyprian\u2019s Greek Orthodox, David Livingstone, Beulah Junior, Gonville Academy, Whitehorse Manor, Heavers Farm, Ecclesbourne, The Crescent and Elm Wood are all \u201cgood\u201d, says Ofsted, with Rockmount, St James the Great RC and West\u00a0Thornton \u201coutstanding\u201d. Secondaries: The\u00a0BRIT School is \u201cgood\u201d; the Harris Academy Upper Norwood, Harris City Academy Crystal Palace and Harris Academy South Norwood are\u00a0all \u201coutstanding\u201d. Hang out at\u2026 The cafe at the fabulous Edwardian Stanley Halls. Where to buy Auckland Road, Howden Road, on and off South Norwood Hill. Also look west via Whitehorse Lane towards Grangewood Park; and the Victorian terraces and semis around Alber Road. Detacheds and townhouses, \u00a3625,000-\u00a31.3m. Semis, \u00a3450,000-\u00a3900,000. Large terraces, \u00a3450,000-\u00a3625,000; smaller terraces, \u00a3300,000-\u00a3450,000.
