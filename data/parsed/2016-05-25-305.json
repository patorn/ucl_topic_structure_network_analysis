  "body": "A Liberal candidate has resigned and given a frank interview in which she criticised her local party and suggested voters may be best served by a Green or independent. Carolyn Currie was contesting the seat of Whitlam, a safe Labor seat held by Stephen Jones, who is standing again. The seat, named after the former Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam, was previously known as Throsby and and is located in the Illawarra and Southern Highlands of New South Wales. In an interview on ABC Illawarra, Currie explained she had decided to withdraw because she was \u201clike a general with no troops\u201d.    Related: Greens will spend $4bn more on hospitals up to 2020, says Di Natale    \u201cIt is very difficult for me to mount any sort of reasonable campaign with no troops, as any general would know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve encountered some remarkable geographic locations; it is an area that needs a remarkable person who can drive vast distances up a number of inclines. It also needs someone who can unite a couple of very disparate groups.\u201d She highlighted the Liberals\u2019 weakness in the area, saying \u201cat the moment there are no Liberal party branches in the Illawarra and there are only three in the Highlands\u201d. Currie spoke about Whitlam\u2019s beautiful environment and said \u201cit needs a very, very strong person who can unite a number of people to preserve it \u2013 possibly an independent, possibly a Green. But somebody with a lot of leverage in what looks like being a very divided government on a knife edge.\u201d \u201cI cannot offer that and meanwhile I don\u2019t believe that I need to be a sacrificial lamb, travelling a number of steep inclines that have yet to be fixed.\u201d Asked about her sacrificial lamb comment, Currie said: \u201cWell, I feel that it is too short a time to be able to, you know, mobilise people as well as produce my own posters, etc, and I\u2019m like Donald Trump, I\u2019m self-funding, but I don\u2019t have his resources.\u201d Currie is a consultant who lives in Mosman, but had told ABC Illawarra previously that she spent about half her time in Bundanoon in the Southern Highlands. She was only selected as the candidate two weeks ago, but was a Liberal candidate for the Senate in 2007.  Currie said she faced resistance from the local Liberal branches which \u201cdidn\u2019t want to run a candidate in the first place\u201d. She said a number of people \u2013 \u201cmainly females\u201d \u2013 in the federal electoral conference had told her that they did not want a candidate. \u201cI was told quite clearly that, although there might be a number of people who are not official members of the Liberal party [who] would help me, the official members of the Liberal party would not! In fact, [they would] possibly do the opposite.\u201d Pushed to explain who had told her they didn\u2019t want a candidate, Currie said it was confidential. \u201cNo look, you\u2019re probably going to lead to my expulsion, very shortly,\u201d she said. \u201cI have done the right thing by my party, by country, by this area.\u201d Stephen Jones told Guardian Australia it was \u201cnot surprising [Currie] wouldn\u2019t endorse the Labor candidate, but it is surprising she wouldn\u2019t endorse Malcolm Turnbull\u201d.   Related: David Marr on the one thing that's stopping the Coalition from ruling forever \u2013 podcast    \u201cClearly the division nationally is reflected in the local Liberal branches in Whitlam. Currie was an inappropriate choice, she lives in North Sydney and was running in the Illawarra,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dissension in the party ranks appears to be playing out throughout NSW. It\u2019s the Abbott-Turnbull division, conservatives versus moderates. Whoever the candidate in Whitlam is [they] will be leading a divided group \u2013 just as Malcolm Turnbull is leading a divided group. They\u2019re trying to paper over the cracks in the campaign but it\u2019s busting out all over the place.\u201d The New South Wales Liberal Party said in a statement: \u201cThe candidate for Whitlam has indicated that she is not in a position to continue with the campaign. We wish her all the best. An announcement regarding a new candidate will be made shortly.\u201d Asked about Currie\u2019s resignation, Malcolm Turnbull said: \u201cI\u2019m sure we will have a great candidate flying the Liberal flag. She\u2019s made her decision as she is entitled to do so but I\u2019m totally focused on jobs and growth and our national economic plan across the country including in the Illawarra.\u201d The Liberal candidate\u2019s withdrawal comes as Labor moves to replace Northern Territory senator Nova Peris after she resigned on Wednesday to pursue a job in the AFL. According to reports, Peris did not contact either the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, or the Labor national secretary, George Wright, before her resignation, speaking only to Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, since the story of the AFL job broke on Monday.",
