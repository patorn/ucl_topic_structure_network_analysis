  "body": "My phone rings and the youngest one\u2019s name pops up. It is Saturday night; he is home and I am out, so I am not expecting good news. Still, it\u2019s 8.30. We left the house half an hour ago. How bad could it be? \u201cOK, so you know the kitchen light,\u201d he says. \u201cThe light over the table?\u201d I say. \u201cOh God,\u201d says my wife, who\u2019s standing next to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d I realise that his decision to ring me and not her was both tactical and wise. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cSo Tom was trying to adjust it to make it higher, and the bit where it attaches to the ceiling just completely cracked.\u201d \u201cCracked as in broke off?\u201d I say. I have supplementary questions \u2013 \u201cWho is Tom?\u201d is among them \u2013 but my priority is a full damage\u00a0assessment. \u201cAs in, like, came away,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re clearing it up now.\u201d \u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cAny live wires hanging out?\u201d \u201cSome,\u201d he says. \u201cTell me what\u2019s happening!\u201d my wife says. \u201cAnd the fire,\u201d I say. \u201cWould you describe it as\u00a0raging?\u201d When we get home later the damage is apparent: fixing smashed, counterweight smashed, shade smashed. The broken pieces are wrapped in newspaper. What remains lies on the table, still attached to the slack wire hanging from the hole in the ceiling.      The light \u2013 a heavy, ceramic thing \u2013 had been the focus of many of my most daring electrical repairs. I replaced its worn-out cord some years ago, although I cracked the fitting in the process, after which the bulb would occasionally drop out and shatter on the kitchen table. My solution \u2013 I\u00a0moved the fruit bowl under it, so the bulb would fall into the soft, upturned palm formed by a\u00a0bunch of bananas \u2013 was deemed insufficiently forward-thinking by my wife. I sourced a\u00a0replacement fitting that didn\u2019t quite match, and constructed a Frankenstein version out of old and new parts. Now there was nothing left to repair. The next day we eat lunch warily, gathered up at one end of the table, away from the wire. \u201cYou should possibly do something about that,\u201d my wife says, pointing. I promise to address the situation, but I need to turn off the electricity first, and the Leicester match takes priority. After that we are scheduled to travel up to the oldest one\u2019s university to have dinner with him. The light will have to wait.      The oldest one\u2019s phone is broken, so our efforts to tell him we\u2019ve arrived are thwarted. We breach security and find his room. He\u2019s not in it, but the door is held open by a woolly hat, the mark of a\u00a0resident rarely in possession of his key. The room is comprehensively trashed, the floor littered with bottles, cans, mugs, plates, clothes and towels. My wife lies down on the unmade bed. \u201cI feel sick from the bus,\u201d she says. \u201cThis room is disgusting.\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d says the oldest, appearing in the doorway. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThanks for clearing up.\u201d \u201cI did clear up,\u201d he says. \u201cIs that gin?\u201d I say, pointing to a bottle on the floor. \u201cDo you have ice?\u201d \u201cI know where I can steal some,\u201d he says. I look around me and I realise that even now,\u00a0if\u00a0left to my own devices, this is probably how I would live. It is both alarming and a\u00a0strange\u00a0comfort. After dinner the eldest walks us to the bus stop. \u201cI don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll see you again,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m coming back Thursday to vote,\u201d he says. That\u2019s only four days, I think. \u201cIf we\u2019re not home when you get there,\u201d I say, \u201cgive the kitchen a wide berth.\u201d",
