  "body": "\u201cLife in Beijing happens in the streets,\u201d explains Jens Schott Knudsen (@pamhule), a lawyer and freelance photographer who lives in the Chinese capital. \u201cThe scarcity of personal space pushes daily activities outside \u2013 from eating and drinking to singing and exercise. At night, Beijing\u2019s streets transform into social hubs. Communal life and an outdoor culture still define much of the city.\u201d Through his pictures, Knudsen aims to capture both this outdoor culture and the tension between new and old in the cityscape \u2013 from the architecture to the lights and activity. As a photographer, he has collaborated with historians and urban planners to document Beijing\u2019s rapid changes, which provide him with constant inspiration. An exhibition of his photography is currently on show in the city.
