Amid the glamour of the Met Gala it is easy to forget that \u201cfashion\u2019s Oscars\u201d are held to celebrate the opening of the latest exhibition from the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute. This year, that exhibition is Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology, which brings some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge fashion together to examine the relationship between couture and technology, the hand-created and the machine-made. Featuring more than 170 examples of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear, dating from the early 1900s to the present, the Costume Institute\u2019s curator Andrew Bolton says he set out to finally provide an answer for a debate that has simmered for decades \u2013 is fashion art? \u201cI\u2019m tired of it,\u201d Bolton said of the debate. \u201cArt critics sometimes find it hard to accept that fashion is art because there\u2019s a functionality to it. We have to ask different questions of fashion \u2013 is it relevant, is it significant, does it have meaning, quality. It\u2019s undeniably art.\u201d   Related: The Met Gala 2016: what will the guests be wearing?    Among the designers on display are Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Madame Gr\u00e8s and Iris van Herpen \u2013 the Dutch fashion couturier who, in 2010, became the first person to include a 3D-printed haute couture garment in their catwalk show. Van Herpen\u2019s designs \u2013 which look more like wearable sculptures \u2013 are at the forefront of fashion technology, combining traditional hand crafting with cutting-edge techniques such as 3D printing, laser cutting and digital knitting. The Robert Lehman Wing galleries, on the museum\u2019s first floor and ground level, have been transformed into a building-within-a-building using white scrims. Embroidery and feather work are showcased on the upper floor of the exhibition, while pleating, lacework and leatherwork occupy the lower galleries. One exhibit, an intricate wedding dress by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel. Lagerfeld\u2019s hand-drawn design was \u201ctransferred onto a computer to make a pixilated Baroque pattern, rhinestones were heat transferred by machine, outlined by hand with gold paint and finished with pearls and gemstones,\u201d making it \u201cthe perfect case study\u201d, Bolton said.  The exhibition \u2013 one of a few currently showing across the US to examine the meeting of tech and textiles \u2013 is held against the backdrop of an important moment for the industry, where disposable fashion dominates.  \u201cSometimes the artistry of fashion is completely lost in a world that is obsessed by fast fashion, consumerism, celebrity disposable fashion,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThat was one of the ideas. And I wanted to show how the proximity to pr\u00e9t-\u00e2-porter and haute couture is diminishing.\u201d Jonathan Ive, chief design officer for Apple \u2013 the gala and exhibition\u2019s primary sponsor \u2013 said he believes \u201cone can only understand a material with your hands that you can come to understand its true nature,\u201d but that he hoped the exhibit will challenge the preconception that \u201cthe former is somehow inherently more valuable than the latter.\u201d Tonight\u2019s partygoers are unlikely to be bogged down in such conceptualities at the \u201cultimate global celebrity/power cocktail\u201d, as it has been dubbed by the New York Times, where all eyes are will be on the outfits of America\u2019s celebrity royalty \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian. Ive is one of the Met Gala\u2019s co-hosts, along with pop star Swift, designer Miuccia Prada, and the event\u2019s annual host, editor-in-chief of American Vogue Anna Wintour. The event\u2019s honorary chairs are Lagerfeld, Miuccia Prada and Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, Louis Vuitton\u2019s artistic director. Started by publicist Eleanor Lambert in 1948 as a philanthropic ball for New York socialites, Wintour\u2019s turn as chairwoman has seen the event\u2019s profile skyrocket. At $30,000 a ticket for the estimated 600 attendees, it is expected to raise $12m for the Costume Institute. Lagerfeld\u2019s wedding dress, like many exquisite couture creations in the exhibition and those to be showcased at the ball, were only made to be worn once. There\u2019s no second run for this kind of perfectionism. It had better be a good party.",
