  "body": "My boyfriend and I have a long-distance relationship, and only see each other once every two months. The only problem is I rarely had opportunities to be dominant or \u201con top\u201d in sex early on in the relationship. Now he wants me to be, and I want to\u00a0be, but I am just so bad at it. I just feel embarrassed.  Excessive performance pressure always prevents sex from being exciting, satisfying or truly intimate. Let go of your wish to \u201cbe good at it\u201d, and focus instead on simple pleasure and fun. I\u00a0understand your anxiety about limited time, but as a couple, your current trajectory will only lead to a reduction in self-confidence and a diminishing erotic connection. The best response to a complaint about passivity is a challenge: \u201cThen tell me exactly how you like to be touched and what feels good?\u201d No one can be expected to know these things without help. Insist on mutual information-gathering within an erotic context. Having the confidence to take charge sexually requires knowledge of his erotic triggers and physical responses, as well as your own, and on not being afraid to gently demand feedback. Most people are aroused by their partner\u2019s demonstrated passion. Fearlessly take your pleasure, and in doing so, you will be helping him with his own insecurities. Without the partnership of sharing and guidance, sex with another person can be lonely and embarrassing. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist specialising in sexual disorders. \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments). Each week, Pamela chooses one problem to answer, which will be published online and in print. She regrets that she cannot enter into personal correspondence.",
