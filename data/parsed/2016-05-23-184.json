Not only did Crossan win the Book of the Year award but she also received the Children\u2019s Choice award for her book written in blank verse (which means it doesn\u2019t rhyme!).   Related: Sarah Crossan: how writing about conjoined twins changed the way I wrote    One tells the story of conjoined twins Grace and Tippi. As they grow up and develop different habits and opinions, the sisters discover how difficult it is to have to always have your hip stuck to another\u2019s hip and basically share a body.         Sarah Crossan told us that she changed the way she writes for One. Previously, Sarah wrote her books as soon as the idea came to her head, but when she wrote One, she took time to research \u2013 read books, watch documentaries and interview conjoined twins, experts and surgeons \u2013 to be able to tell an authentic story.

Alongside the Book of the Year Award, the judges gave fiction, illustration, first children\u2019s book and special awards.    Related: Louise O'Neill: 'I think this book will infuriate a lot of people because it\u2019s going to push those buttons'    The Honour Award for Fiction went to Louise O\u2019Neill for her YA feminist novel about rape culture Asking For It. The devastating and raw book talks about a teenage Irish girl who is raped at a party and blamed for it by her small town community.  In an interview for the Guardian children\u2019s books site, Louise O\u2019Neill said \u201cAsking for It was a harrowing book to write; I felt completely depleted when it was finished and a lot of that was the reading I had to do around it and the research I had to do, meeting people who were victims of rape and having to interview them. I was having constant nightmares where I was raped and I think because I was so entrenched in it\u2026\u201d The book has struck a chord with many teenagers, including with one of our reviewers who had been forced to give in to some milder yet infuriating judgement about the way they dressed.     Lauren O\u2019Neill won the Honour Award for illustration with Gulliver. Photograph: PR    Classic, timeless books have also been rewarded. Lauren O\u2019Neill got the Honour Award for Illustration for her drawings for the classic tale of Gulliver by Jonathan Swift, retold by Mary Webb. The judges said O\u2019Neill made \u201ccaptivating, immersive illustrations that capture the original tale\u2019s humour and satire\u201d while bringing the book to life for new generations of readers.      Finally, John and Fatti (Kathi) Burke were awarded both The Judges\u2019 Special Award and the Eil\u00eds Dillon Award for a first children\u2019s book for Irelandopedia. The book takes you on a wide tour of Ireland\u2019s sights and sounds, flora and fauna, local celebrities, world famous pop stars and athletes, as well as local delicacies and traditions. Illustrated by Fatti (Kathi) Burke and written by her father John, the compendium \u201chas infectious appeal for all the family\u201d, said the judges.          Congratulations to all the winners!",
