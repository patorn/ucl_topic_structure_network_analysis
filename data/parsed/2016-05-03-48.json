  "body": "Reading the account of how James Goodfellow invented the first ATM (Money, 30 April) reminded me of my first National Westminster Group 24-hour cash card from the 1960s, which I still have. It is rather akin to the old computer-punched cards and when fed into the hole in the wall dispensed the princely sum of \u00a310 after I had entered my 10-digit pin . But\u00a0unlike today\u2019s cards, the machine swallowed the card, which was then returned to me in the post for further use. The instruction leaflet accompanying the card proudly announced that \u201cCashcard holders can now use their cards at any of the dispensers (in London) listed overleaf\u201d \u2013 all 13 of them.Mike RoweOffham, Kent \u2022 In expressing his concern for the future of the BBC at the hands of this government (Report, 3 May), David Attenborough takes comfort from the fact\u00a0that \u201cThey know that the BBC holds a very precious place in a large proportion of voters\u2019 minds and they can\u2019t play fast and loose with it\u201d. You could say the same about the NHS, and look what the\u00a0Tories are doing to that.Dr Bob BuryLeeds \u2022 Another iTunes irritation (Force quit, G2, 28 April) is its insulting categorisation of every piece of music as a song. Has Apple never heard of a mazurka, raga, sonata or symphony?Richard SteinitzNew Mill, West Yorkshire \u2022 It is unlikely that when the Queen reaches 100 anyone will send her a telegram (Letters, 3 May). The Post Office discontinued the service in 1982 and the Queen now sends cards to those\u00a0who reach 100.David Bettoney Zeal Monachorum, Devon \u2022 For some reason, talk of Mike Ashley rescuing BHS workers (Financial, 2\u00a0May) reminds me of Granny having Red Riding Hood to dinner. Paul MartinLondon \u2022 While denigrating the tautologies in your M&S article (Letters, 2 May), David Sawyer talks of his developing a \u201cnervous tic\u201d.
