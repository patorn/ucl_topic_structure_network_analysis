  "body": "It\u2019s the night before the year\u2019s first rehearsal with John Mayer, and Bob Weir is strumming an acoustic guitar backstage at a charity gala in Toronto, occasionally pausing to take a sip of Coca-Cola, a bite of a sandwich or a finger\u2019s worth of chewing tobacco. \u201cI\u2019ve got as much on my plate as I\u2019ve ever had. No \u2013 more,\u201d says the 68-year-old, not referring to the neatly sliced row of sandwich triangles that sit on the table by his side but the amount of work the guitarist and singer has taken on since he and his Grateful Dead bandmates wrapped up their Fare Thee Well reunion tour in July.

Weir is also working alongside Stanford University\u2019s music director, Giancarlo Aquilanti, to bring the Grateful Dead\u2019s signature improvisational style to the orchestral world. \u201cI\u2019m also doing a TV show, I\u2019m writing a book and I\u2019ve got a solo record coming out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt ain\u2019t easy.\u201d  In a few moments, Weir will march his Birkenstocks through a crowd of high heels and leather loafers to pose with attendees of the Einstein Gala, a fundraiser hosted in partnership with the Hebrew University to promote science, technology, engineering, arts and math (Steam) education, a longtime passion of Weir\u2019s.  \u201cI have kids, and I want them to grow up in a world full of people that they can talk to,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know that I integrate art and science in my life \u2013 it\u2019s all the same to me \u2013 and Christ, it would just be a better world if people thought about things that way and endeavored to enrich their lives with arts and sciences.\u201d      Trey Anastasio, from left, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir at a Fare Thee Well show at in June 2015, in Santa Clara, California.

Recalling the last time all surviving members of the Grateful Dead performed together \u2013 during the Fare Thee Well tour\u2019s final stop at Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field on 5 July \u2013 still brings a smile to Weir\u2019s face, though it can be difficult to see through his mane of white hair. \u201cIt was an adventure. It was fun. If we had had a little more rehearsal we might \u2013 \u201d Suddenly Weir is interrupted by a staffer who enters the room carrying platefuls of the braised beef and chicken stir-fry being served to gala attendees in the adjacent room, all of whom donated between CAD$1,000 and $4,160. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of that shit,\u201d he says, before returning to the conversation at hand. \u201cWhat was the question? Oh yeah. It was an adventure. If we had a little more rehearsal, the music may have been a little tighter, but I think we delivered the goods. Everybody went there to celebrate the legacy, and that\u2019s what got done, and done good and proper.\u201d  When asked whether a summer concert series alongside Hart and Kreutzmann undercuts the finality of the previous summer\u2019s tour, Weir lets out a hearty chuckle. \u201cOf course it does,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m nowhere near done with that heritage and legacy, and this is a new way of approaching it.\u201d  Weir admits that it wasn\u2019t Mayer\u2019s guitar skills that first captured his attention when the two met and performed together on CBS\u2019s Late Late Show in early 2015.  \u201cIt\u2019s not his playing that impressed me; it\u2019s his ears. He listens and responds, and that\u2019s what our music is about,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t play a lot like [the Grateful Dead\u2019s late founding member] Jerry [Garcia], and I hope he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a new approach, a new color, and I can still hear Jerry when we\u2019re playing anyway. That will always be.\u201d      The young Bob Weir Relaxing during rehearsal at the Hollywood Bowl in 1967.

I view death as the last and best reward for a life well lived, so Phil can look forward to dying, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s there yet.\u201d Weir added that even before the diagnosis, Lesh had always preferred playing more intimate, local shows to major tours. \u201cI\u2019m still good for hitting the road,\u201d said Weir. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing that a fair bit. To wit, here I am [in Toronto].\u201d  Weir acknowledges that when musicians of his age embark on major tours and side projects, it often signifies financial distress, but assures his Deadhead following that such is not the case for him and his bandmates. \u201cThis is not an alimony tour; this is a summer tour, and we intend to bring the house down,\u201d he says, with an expression of grave seriousness.  There is at least one music event Weir has no problem watching from the sidelines. Six bands that came of age alongside the Grateful Dead will convene in Indio, California, over two separate weekend events this October as part of the Desert Trip music festival, and Weir expresses little remorse over not receiving an invitation to perform.  \u201cMaybe next year, if they do it, but the slots in that would be too tight,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t have been room for our presentation on that show, because there are too many [other acts], all of which are good. I want to be there, I want to catch it, I will say that. Maybe I\u2019ll bring my family.\u201d  This autumn, Weir is also eagerly anticipating the results of the American presidential election, which he believes will have a positive effect no matter who emerges victorious.  \u201cI think if Hillary [Clinton] \u2013 who is in all likelihood going to be nominated for the Democrats \u2013 wins, it will be because she incorporates a lot of what Bernie Sanders is saying, and the government will tilt that way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Trump wins, I think the whole thing is going to blow up and we\u2019re going to start over, and that\u2019s always a good thing to do.\u201d Though some feared Fare Thee Well would mark the end of the Grateful Dead\u2019s touring legacy, Weir assures fans that he will continue playing Grateful Dead classics for the foreseeable future, no matter who occupies the stage with him.  \u201cWhatever I\u2019m going to be doing, a lot of it will be furthering this heritage, this legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the guy who was saying it was the last show. I\u2019m good to play.\u201d",
