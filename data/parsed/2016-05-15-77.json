  "body": "The Mikado premiered at London\u2019s Savoy theatre in 1885, and its opening run went on and on for 672 shows. Non-devotees might well question the timelessness of mock Orientalism and flagrant misogyny, but Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s capital punishment romcom has always been a money maker, and Scottish Opera \u2013 styling itself as a G&S stronghold after The Pirates of Penzance in 2013 and HMS Pinafore last year \u2013 accordingly tours this new production right into July.  Director Martin Lloyd-Evans has created something utterly reliable and palatable, which for me misses the subversive point of G&S. Designs by Dick Bird are a colourful mash of Victoriana steampunk meets wild west meets geisha chic. A few lines of satire have been updated with mild pokes at tax evaders and Volkswagen (\u201cdodgy dieselists; sie sind on my list\u201d), while Nicola Sturgeon is obvious fodder given her surname is a fish \u2013 which, yes, rhymes with list. Oh for some properly wicked satire.      Spry-voiced and lyrical \u2026 Rebecca Bottone and Nicholas Sharratt in Scottish Opera\u2019s The Mikado. Photograph: James Glossop    More wearying are the unchallenged race and gender stereotypes, with Yum-Yum (a spry-voiced Rebecca Bottone) portrayed as a silly young thing and Katisha (the rich-toned Rebecca de Pont Davies) a ghoulish Tim Burton-esque Miss Havisham. The overture needed a decent kickstart, but generally the orchestra mustered sufficient bounce and decorum under David Steadman, and the fine cast includes Nicholas Sharratt\u2019s sweet and lyrical Nanki-Poo plus some seasoned G&S-ers: it would be hard not to warm to the exquisite timing and pathos of Richard Suart\u2019s hapless executioner. \u2022 At Eden Court, Inverness, 19-21 May. Box office: 01463-234 234. Then touring until 2 July.",
