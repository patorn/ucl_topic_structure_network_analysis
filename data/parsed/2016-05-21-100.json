Related: Elle review: Paul Verhoeven's brazen rape revenge comedy is a dangerous delight    The controversial black comedy was greeted with shocked laughter and enthusiastic applause as it screened at the Cannes film festival earlier today. In the film, directed by Paul Verhoeven, Huppert plays a woman who is brutally raped but deals with the fallout in a perverse and often darkly comical way. \u201cThe story shouldn\u2019t be taken as a realistic story,\u201d she said at a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not a statement about a woman being raped and accepting her rapist, that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. It should be taken as more of a fantasy. The fantasy is within yourself but it\u2019s not necessarily something that you want to happen. It\u2019s something that you couldn\u2019t confess. It\u2019s in your inner thoughts and of course, Paul Verhoeven projects that on screen but it doesn\u2019t mean that it happens to all women in the world. It happens to that woman in particular. It\u2019s not trying to make a general statement and I think when you watch the film, that\u2019s the way you take it.\u201d The film, which the Guardian\u2019s Xan Brooks described as \u201cendlessly disturbing\u201d, is based on the acclaimed novel Oh... by Philippe Djian, and its author defended the central character\u2019s frequently bizarre behaviour.

It\u2019s frightening because people don\u2019t like women to feel free. She wants to react how she likes without following societal codes.\u201d  Verhoeven, who has made films in both the US - such as Basic Instinct and Showgirls - and Europe (Black Book and Turkish Delight), was originally going to make the film in the US but said that \u201cno American actress would take on such an amoral movie\u201d. Dijan added: \u201cAll these wonderful American actresses turned it down for reasons that are so foreign\u201d. Despite also being known for iconic sci-fi movies such as Total Recall and Robocop, Verhoeven is keen to stay grounded from now on. \u201cI\u2019m not so positive about the further development of all this science fiction stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a feeling that everything has been said and done and we should go back to normality. All these big superheroes and whatever, I don\u2019t know what kind of wet dream this is of the US but I feel that we have lost contact with normal people. The story of us is more interesting than that of a superhero.\u201d",
