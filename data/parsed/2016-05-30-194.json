  "body": "That quote from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet comes to mind: \u201cThe lady doth protest too much, methinks.\u201d  The lady in question is the Australian government, which some time in early January saw a draft of a report from a United Nations organisation.  The report, provisionally titled \u201cDestinations at Risk: World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate\u201d, outlined how many world heritage sites around the world were being compromised by the impacts of climate change.   Related: Revealed: report for Unesco on the Great Barrier Reef that Australia didn't want world to see    One of the sites highlighted in the draft report was the Great Barrier Reef. The Australian government doth protest, and Unesco obliged.  As Guardian Australia revealed last week, all mentions of Australia, the Great Barrier Reef, the Northern Territory\u2019s glorious Kakadu national park and Tasmania\u2019s forests were then removed from the report. All this, as the reef\u2019s worst recorded case of mass coral bleaching makes headlines around the world  So why the whitewash?  In a statement to Guardian Australia, the Department of the Environment made two arguments to justify the request for censorship and neither of them makes any sense.  Firstly, the government argued the title of the report \u201chad the potential to cause considerable confusion\u201d. The title Australia objected to was \u201cDestinations at Risk: World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate\u201d. The report was finally published as World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate. The department said the UN world heritage committee had only last year agreed not to place the reef on its list of sites \u201cin danger\u201d.  If the reef then appeared as a case study in a UN report about world heritage sites \u201cat risk\u201d this might confuse people, the department claimed. But the reality is that the reef is both \u201cat risk\u201d and \u201cin danger\u201d from the impacts of climate change \u2013 the government\u2019s own science agencies have warned them of this multiple times, not to mention scientists at leading universities around the world.  The only confusing aspect is how a report about world heritage sites and climate change now omits one of the world\u2019s most iconic natural wonders that has become a faded poster child for the impacts of global warming worldwide.  Australia\u2019s second argument was that having the reef featured in the Unesco report was further \u201cnegative commentary\u201d that \u201cimpacted on tourism\u201d.   Related: Australia covered up UN climate change fears for Tasmania forests and Kakadu    As commentary on The Project pointed out, most people around the world don\u2019t choose their holiday destinations by consulting Unesco reports. The report was a collaboration of two UN bodies \u2013 Unesco and the United Nations Environment Program \u2013 as well as the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), a not-for-profit science advocacy group. Adam Markham, of UCS and lead author of the report, told me he was \u201cnot in any of those conversations\u201d about Australia requesting the reef be removed, and that Unesco had the final say. He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that a Great Barrier Reef case study pegged for the reports was taken out. As soon as the report was published, Markham updated the case study and published it on the UCS blog, where you can now read the guts of the section the Australian government didn\u2019t want published. Guardian Australia also published the censored text. So why did Unesco agree to Australia\u2019s demands? I asked Unesco this, and also whether a note would be added to the report pointing out that mentions of Australia had been taken out. A spokesperson told me only that the following sentence had now been added to the press release:   At the request of the government of Australia, references to Australian sites were removed from the Report (recent information about the state of conservation of the Great Barrier Reef is available on Unesco\u2019s website here: http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/3234).  Unesco should not escape criticism here. The organisation\u2019s willingness to censor one of its own reports in the interests of nothing more than a public relations exercise is troubling. You have to hope this instance is a one-off.  Adding a line to a press release that has already been sent out is, in my view, a poor response to a serious misstep.  In Unesco\u2019s defence, both the spokesperson and Markham said the report was not supposed to be a comprehensive assessment of every world heritage site \u2013 of which there are more than 1,000. But leaving the Great Barrier Reef out of the report is like writing about the risks of oil drilling without mentioning the Deepwater Horizon, or perchance the tragedy of reviewing the works of Shakespeare without ever mentioning Hamlet.  \u201cThis above all: to thine own self be true.\u201d",
