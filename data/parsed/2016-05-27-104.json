  "body": "CONFIRMED AT LAST! After months of whispers and second-guessing, it was today officially announced that the Portuguese manager has signed a contract to restore one of the great clubs of English football to where fans believe it belongs. We are talking, of course, about Carlos Carvalhal, who has given Sheffield Wednesday supporters a mighty fillip by revealing that he has agreed to remain at the club for the next three years and continue the exciting work that he started last June, when he arrived at Hillsborough to be told that the broken sink was just down the corridor, second door on the left. After explaining that he was not some passing plumber but actually the new manager, Carvalhal set about building a slick team \u2013 and now everyone knows who he is.   Related: How Sheffield Wednesday returned from wilderness to stand on brink of big time    \u201cI want to stay at clubs where people are happy with me and where I am happy also,\u201d explained Carvalhal, whose pursuit of happiness is so thorough that he has led 15 clubs in the last 17 years. \u201cBeing happy is the people around you enjoying what you are doing,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf they are I can stay here 10 years. If they aren\u2019t it will be different for me.\u201d On Saturday there is only one way for Wednesday\u2019s children not to be full of woe: Carvalhal\u2019s team must beat Hull City in the Championship play-off final to hoist the club back to the top flight for the first time since 2000. Joining the Premier League will bring a cash bonanza for whoever wins on Saturday \u2013 Aston Villa were given \u00a366m just for fertilising all 19 of their rivals with steaming hot manure last season, for goodness sake, and next year\u2019s b00by prize will be almost double that. When other payments are factored in, it explains why the play-off final is being billed as The \u00a3200m Match. But what Hull and Wednesday are really motivated by is the glory, maybe. Neutrals will all have their own preferences \u2013 or none at all, if we\u2019re being strict about our definition of \u2018neutrals\u2019 \u2013 but perhaps the Premier League needs Wednesday more at the moment: because someone has to stop those feisty upstarts from Leicester City. Wednesday\u2019s last Premier League match was a 4-0 spanking of none other than Leicester back in 2000, and if they had been around this season they might have whizzed on Leicester\u2019s party chips just as they did in 1929, when Wednesday were crowned champions of England after beating Leicester into second place, which was the Foxes\u2019 highest finish until Claudio Ranieri metamorphosed into the most endearing magician since Elizabeth Montgomery. Who\u2019s to say Carvalhal, or Steve Bruce, is not capable of such a trick? Eh?

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cManchester United is one of these clubs where you really need to be prepared for it because it is what I used to a call a \u2018giant club\u2019. And giant clubs must be for the best managers and I think I am ready for it\u201d \u2013 right, stick a fork in Jos\u00e9 for now.     \u2018See, it\u2019s this tea-time email thingy. Unicode! Honk. Of course you\u2019re right, Jos\u00e9, it\u2019s no Hatchet Man, he went in hardest, but what are you going to do?\u2019 Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA    FIVER LETTERS \u201cThe Special One and Manchester United. Has there ever been a collaboration that more people have wanted to fail?\u201d \u2013 Oliver Derum. \u201c\u2018There is a mystique and a romance about [Man Utd].\u2019 He\u2019s been in the job less than a day and Jos\u00e9\u2019s already on board with all of that X-Men promotional guff\u201d \u2013 James Tong. \u201cFair play, Didier Deschamps is a very French-sounding name. But \u2018the only one in France\u2019, M. Cantona (yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day)? I give you both Pierre Perrier and Alix Poisson from Les Revenants (moody Mogwai-soundtracked zombie series much beloved of Guardianistas) and the magnificent Aurelie Bourgeois, current holder of my work\u2019s Best Intranet Name trophy. Fiver prizeless continentally suggestive name o\u2019 the day award, anyone?\u201d \u2013 James Maltby. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any way you could feature my charity Euro 2016 wallchart somewhere on Big Website is there? This is the third tournament I\u2019ve illustrated a wallchart, with the proceeds going to the Luton & Dunstable Hospital Neonatal unit each time. The wallchart that I made two years ago for the World Cup in Brazil ended up raising \u00a32,290 for them \u2013 it\u2019d be great to beat that this time around. This year\u2019s wallchart is fronted by the 1988 Ruud Gullit* who, despite the Netherlands not qualifying, has taken it upon himself to travel through time to bring you his guide to a summer of $exy football, featuring facts, stats, maps and stadia plus a cartoon of Ruud in his pants. There\u2019s more information here on my website. Thanks for bearing with me. *This wallchart is in no way endorsed by either the Ruud Gullit from now, the 1988 Ruud Gullit or any future versions of Ruud Gullit (I\u2019m guessing)\u201d \u2013 Elliott Quince.

By my calculation, after buying an extra 23 shares, he extended his ownership from 67.01% to 67.05%. I know that you are struggling for content, now that the only football competition in the world has finished for the summer, but this really does scrape the scrapings off the barrel\u201d \u2013 Tim Barton. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve had our giggles, let\u2019s admit that most of us knew all along that Noble Francis, etc is actually Luther Blissett\u201d \u2013 Bill Cleere. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

I now have the chance to make this dream come true. Tomorrow is the game of my life without doubt.\u201d Didier Deschamps took little time in launching his lawyer in the direction of Eric Cantona after his former France team-mate claimed the squad selection for Euro 2016 may have been racially motivated.  Reading have thanked Brian McDermott \u201cfor all his hard work\u201d for the second time in three years, before hurriedly bundling him into a cannon and firing into the Berkshire wilds. Well, Grazeley. \u201cThe board will now undertake a rigorous recruitment process over the next few weeks to identify the right man,\u201d repeated a club suit. Who needs quarter-final replays? Not the FA Cup. \u201cWhile fully respecting tradition and history, this new development will help the Cup retain its status as a much-loved and world-renowned competition,\u201d honked FA chief suit Martin Glenn.
