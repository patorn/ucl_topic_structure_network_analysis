  "body": "Boris Johnson has been accused by the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, the Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames, of \u201cfundamentally dishonest gymnastics\u201d for criticising a planned multibillion-pound trade deal between the US and the EU that he had previously lauded as \u201cChurchillian\u201d for its brilliance. Soames, the MP for Mid Sussex, said Johnson\u2019s change of position on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was yet more evidence of his \u201ccomplete lack of credibility and coherence\u201d in arguing the economic case for Britain to leave the EU.     The former defence secretary Liam Fox speaks ahead of Johnson at a Vote Leave event. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images    The former mayor of London, a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign, wrote in his Daily Telegraph column in October 2014 that TTIP \u2013 a deal being negotiated by the EU commission with Washington \u2013 was a \u201cgreat project\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is Churchillian in that it builds transatlantic links, it is all about free trade, and it brings Britain and Europe closer to America. The idea is to create a gigantic free-trade zone between the EU and the US \u2026 There is absolutely nothing not to like about the TTIP.  \u201cAs Churchill might have said, it is altogether unsordid. And yet virtually the only commentary we have been offered is absurdly hostile and misinformed. The debate is dominated by leftwing misery guts anti-globalisation campaigners.\u201d In his Telegraph piece, Johnson rejected any idea that the free-trade deal could threaten the NHS by leaving it open to competition from US firms, a view now taken by Vote Leave. He wrote: \u201cIf we get the TTIP agreed, it will certainly not mean the privatisation of the NHS, and nor will it mean a green light for fracking [in] Sussex. At the very most, it will mean that there is some protection against government deciding \u2013 locally, at state level or nationally \u2013 to legislate in some arbitrary and unexpected way so as to discriminate against foreign companies.

This new free-trade pact with America is not a threat: it is a sensational opportunity to break down the remaining barriers to trade with \u2026 the biggest single export destination for Britain.\u201d However, in a speech last Monday backing Brexit, Johnson changed his tune, likening the EU\u2019s role in the continuing TTIP talks to a \u201cpantomime horse\u201d in which the 28 member states tried, chaotically, to agree a joint position on a venture that was preventing the UK from striking its own, quicker and more effective bilateral trade deals. The speech by Johnson, who has written a biography of Churchill, lampooned the TTIP process. \u201cAs for the argument that we need the muscle of EU membership if we are to do trade deals \u2013 well, as I say, at the results after 42 years of membership, the EU has done trade deals with the Palestinian Authority and San Marino. Bravo. But it has failed to conclude agreements with India, China or even America,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because negotiating on behalf of the EU is like trying to ride a vast pantomime horse, with 28 people blindly pulling in different directions.\u201d He added: \u201cFor decades, deals with America have been blocked by the French film industry, and the current TTIP negotiations are stalled at least partly because Greek feta cheese manufacturers object to the concept of American feta. They may be right, aesthetically, but it should not be delaying us in this country.\u201d Soames told the Observer that Johnson\u2019s change of position was astonishing, but not surprising. \u201cThis is typical of Boris\u2019s now regular inconsistencies in praising the TTIP transatlantic deal as Churchillian a mere 18 months ago, and now having jumped ship, apparently changing his mind yet again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is another example of Boris\u2019s complete lack of credibility and coherence on this very important transaction. People will simply not understand this fundamentally dishonest gymnastics.\u201d     Johnson arrives in Bristol to give a speech in favour of leaving the EU and \u2018unshackling Britannia\u2019. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images    The former cabinet minister Michael Heseltine also weighed in, saying that while people loved Boris for his jokes, \u201cconsistency somehow eludes him\u201d. In a further twist last night, friends of Johnson said that he is still a supporter of TTIP. They said the comments from Soames were part of \u201canother ill-informed and fundamentally dishonest attack by the Remain camp. What he\u2019s attacking is the fact that the vested interests of member countries prevent any progress towards a TTIP deal. If the UK votes to leave the EU, we can do our own trade deal with the US free from member state interference.\u201d However, Vote Leave had earlier confirmed that it is now officially opposed to TTIP because the UK should be doing its own deals, not having them negotiated on its behalf by the EU, and because the agreement threatened the NHS.

Photograph: PA      The former foreign secretary David Owen, a supporter of Britain leaving the EU, has taken the lead in warning that TTIP is a danger to the NHS. \u201cWe are agreed in Vote Leave that whatever our political views on the present marketisation of the NHS, decisions on the NHS should for the future be for the UK parliament and devolved administrations to take. It should not be for the European commission nor the European parliament,\u201d Lord Owen said. Johnson\u2019s apparent U-turn on TTIP was criticised as he joined fellow leave campaigners at events across the country in the biggest day yet for the EU referendum campaign. David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn appeared at separate rallies for the remain camp on Saturday, unveiling a campaign poster in his Oxfordshire constituency of Witney on Saturday, said leaving the EU would cost each UK household \u00a34,300 and precipitate the loss of billions of pounds in funding for infrastructure projects.

That is the last thing our economy needs.\u201d By contrast, Johnson told a campaign event that Britain can \u201cprosper, thrive and flourish as never before\u201d if it chooses to leave the EU. \u201cWe have passion and courage, and a sense of duty,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not just the time to unshackle Britannia from her chains, though it certainly is, it\u2019s a time to speak up for freedom across the whole continent.\u201d Meanwhile, at a rally in London, Corbyn said the government, rather than Brussels, was to blame for the \u201cmany problems\u201d facing Britain. \u201cThere is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in this country face many problems: from insecure jobs, low pay and unaffordable housing to stagnating living standards and environmental degradation, and the responsibility for them lies in 10 Downing Street, not in Brussels.
