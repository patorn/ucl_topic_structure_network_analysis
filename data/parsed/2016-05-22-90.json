  "body": "Eddie Jones did not get where he is today by naming squads that fail to generate a deliberate ripple of surprise. The England tour party heading for Australia certainly falls into that category, containing as it does a couple of totally fresh names and more than one notable omission. This is a group picked less on reputation than a potential willingness to get up Wallaby noses.   Related: Eddie Jones singles out Kyle Sinckler for England tour to Australia    The strong streak of feisty aggression running through the marbled heart of Jones\u2019s selections includes the lively uncapped Northampton back-row forward Teimana Harrison as well as Ellis Genge, who is 21, and Kyle Sinckler, both young props in whom Jones sees the belligerent edge he loves in his Test forwards. It is the same with Ben Te\u2019o, the latest rugby league \u00e9migr\u00e9 to try his luck at the top level of the 15-a-side code. The inclusion of the Harlequins winger Marland Yarde is also based largely upon what he might be capable of doing rather than any recent compelling evidence. It will be a heavy blow to the unfortunate Chris Ashton, currently the form winger in the country, while Kieran Brookes, Matt Kvesic, Danny Cipriani and Dave Attwood have also been deemed surplus to tour requirements. Saturday\u2019s hamstring injury to Manu Tuilagi may yet grant a reprieve for Luther Burrell unless the Leicester centre makes a miracle recovery but, otherwise, Jones has made it very clear where he stands on a number of individuals. Unlike previous England coaches he positively delights in throwing an entire cattery among the pigeons whenever the opportunity arises. No matter that Ashton has been performing splendidly for the European champions while Yarde has been toiling with Harlequins; in the back of Jones\u2019s mind is the try the latter scored past New Zealand\u2019s Richie McCaw on tour in New Zealand two years ago. \u201cMarland has got a lot of growth in him. He wants to portray a gangster image but I think he can do things in our team that will really add to us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI showed the players a photo of the team meeting before the Wales triple crown game in 2014. We had about eight players circled in red who are no longer part of the England setup. Why? They haven\u2019t worked hard enough to improve their game.\u201d Ashton, consequently, has been told to tighten his defence even more if he wishes to resume a Test career he had hoped might shortly be resurrected. \u201cAshton is unlucky. He\u2019s a great finisher, but I want a bit more than that \u2026 in my eyes he\u2019s not in the top three wings in England.\u201d There was a similar blunt message for Brookes, who shared in his country\u2019s Six Nations grand slam triumph only two months ago. \u201cWith front-rowers you need guys who want to put their body on the line,\u201d he said, clearly hopeful the no-nonsense Genge, on loan with Leicester from Bristol, fits that category. \u201cRichard Cockerill says he\u2019s a bit of a lad but he\u2019s a guy who wants to improve. He\u2019s a bit like Sinckler. Both of them had difficult backgrounds and now have a fantastic opportunity to make their mark in the world through rugby.\u201d The 29-year-old Te\u2019o is a slightly different case, having already made his mark in league with South Sydney and represented Samoa in the 13-man code. The shadow of Sam Burgess inevitably hangs over his rapid rise from Leinster\u2019s midfield to England\u2019s squad \u2013 he is eligible through an English mother and his imminent move to Worcester \u2013 but Tuilagi\u2019s probable withdrawal leaves him close to a Test debut in the first Test in Brisbane on 11 June. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen of him playing for Leinster he could be a very valuable player for us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe can play through the line, he can play before the line and he\u2019s a great hitter.\u201d Taking a third scrum-half such as Dan Robson might also have been useful and both Kvesic and Will Fraser have reason to be disappointed, but Jones remains adamant that pandering to public opinion is always an error. \u201cOne of the best pieces of advice I ever got was that if you listen to the fans you\u2019ll end up in the grandstand with them.\u201d   Related: Eddie Jones has little leeway for England changes on Australia tour | Dean Ryan    Nor is he impressed by the argument his players will be tired. \u201cThe average number of games our EPS players have played is 20 games. If anyone is going to sit there and tell me 20 games of rugby is too much then it\u2019s not a serious argument.\u201d He also has his sights set on upsetting Wales at Twickenham on Sunday. \u201cWe have the chance to beat them again. There is nothing better than that. Wales have got an enormous amount of pressure on them \u2026 they go into the game as red-hot favourites.\u201d As with his selections, Jones rarely resists the temptation to give the pot a vigorous stir.
