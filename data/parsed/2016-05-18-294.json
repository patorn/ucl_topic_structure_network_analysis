He was a 25-year-old man who looked to have everything going for him, but he couldn\u2019t vocalise his problems.\u201d That is how Rowland Bennett describes his best friend Charlie Berry, who took his own life a year ago. Suicide is the biggest cause of death for men under 49 in the UK, and men are three times more likely to take their own lives than women. According to campaigners, most men thinking about suicide never talk to anyone about the problems that have brought them to crisis point. After his friend\u2019s death, Bennett, a booker and promoter in the music industry, became involved with the male suicide awareness charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm), organising its 10th anniversary fundraiser night in London. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been involved, I\u2019ve heard more and more people say \u2018I lost a friend\u2019 or \u2018My mate, the party guy, killed himself\u2019 \u2013 everyone has got those stories,\u201d he says. \u201cMen don\u2019t want to be that guy talking about depression. They want to be the character people think they are.\u201d   Related: The cost of mental illness    Male suicide research by the charity Samaritans suggests men often compare themselves against a \u201cgold standard\u201d of masculinity which is often incredibly difficult to live up to. The charity has highlighted the issue for middle-aged men, who have the highest rate of suicide of any age group. Research manager Elizabeth Scowcroft says that is probably down to a combination of factors, including relationship breakdown and financial pressures. \u201cWe need to think about ways we can engage with those who are most at risk, targeting the right people, encouraging them to seek help,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about talking to people earlier rather than once they are at crisis point and feel they want to take their own lives.\u201d Calm\u2019s chief executive, Jane Powell, says rather than focusing on particular risk groups, society needs to see suicide as an \u201cevery man\u201d issue. \u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating is there is an overwhelming sexism when it comes to looking at this. At what point are we going to look at why more men \u2013 regardless of age \u2013 take their own lives than women?\u201d For Powell, while women in recent years have been given more freedom to define their roles, men are still expected to conform to society\u2019s notions that they should not display weakness or vulnerability. But, she adds, the idea that men just need to shout louder about their problems is misleading: \u201cMen are really good at communicating and understanding signs from society \u2013 and the signs they are getting are \u2018man up, grow a pair\u2019. We need to fight all those messages which say you have to be this way.\u201d  In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.\u00a0In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.
