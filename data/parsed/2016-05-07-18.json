However, the picture showed constables from Kent deployed at the Orgreave coking works at the time \u2013 not officers from South Yorkshire. The article recalled a 1963 police brutality inquiry and said the force\u2019s leadership was involved, adding: \u201cMore than 50 years later, another chief constable of South Yorkshire police has been forced to step down.\u201d South Yorkshire police were not established until 1974; the force at the time was Sheffield City police. Our walking guide to Cardiff last week mentioned Cardiff Castle\u2019s \u201canimal wall\u201d \u201calong which realistic sketches of amazing animals were painted in the 19th century\u201d. The wall features sculptures, not sketches. The error was ours, not the author\u2019s (\u201cBest foot forward\u201d. In Focus, last week, page 30). \u201cNearly three quarters of Britons expect rapid decline in NHS, survey finds\u201d (News, last week, page 12) omitted polling details. Populus interviewed just over 1,000 adults in six European countries between 16 and 30 March.
