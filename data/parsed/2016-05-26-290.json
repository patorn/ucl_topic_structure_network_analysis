Once a towering demonstration of communist ideals, the site fell into disrepair in the 1990s as the USSR crumbled around it. As capitalism took over, it became host to a ramshackle fairground and market, and its pavilions were converted into kitsch showrooms for the goods flooding the new Russian market. Now, after 25 years, the site is receiving a reported 163bn rouble (\u00a32.2bn) revamp, a redevelopment which is the topic of the Russian pavilion at this year\u2019s Venice architecture biennale, which will host national presentations by 37 countries. Specific details of the exhibition, which opens on Saturday, are under wraps, but it promises a \u201claboratory\u201d, taking visitors through \u201cthe past, present and future\u201d. After the Biennale it will travel back to VDNKh and take up permanent residence there. But while some residents are eager to tout VDNKh as an example of a more chic and liveable Moscow, others consider the celebration of the site\u2019s Soviet legacy deeply ambiguous.    Sergey Kuznetsov, the pavilion's curator, acknowledges VDNKh\u2019s original function as 'advertising for the Soviet regime'    The city took over management of VDNKh in 2014 and reinstated its original Soviet name, which is a Russian acronym for \u201cexhibition of achievements of national economy\u201d. Its historical pavilions, originally built to honour individual republics and industrial sectors such as metallurgy and atomic energy, are being restored as cultural venues to house art and educational exhibitions, a project the city authorities say will be completed by 2020. A huge relief by Soviet sculptor Evgeniy Vuchetich reading \u201cGlory to the Soviet people, the Champion of Peace!\u201d was uncovered while the central pavilion was renovated. It was unveiled in March by the Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin. The curator of the 2016 Biennale pavilion, Sergey Kuznetsov, who is also chief architect of Moscow, acknowledges VDNKh\u2019s original function as \u201cadvertising for the Soviet regime\u201d. However, he compares the site to a \u201cmotherboard with hardware and software\u201d, with a framework that can be repurposed without its political associations being rehabilitated. Kuznetsov says the revamp project and the Biennale pavilion are not ideological. \u201cWe cannot deny great architecture in terms of sculpture, art and park design and should use it, but for our modern times,\u201d he says.  VDNKh\u2019s revival is part of a wider move to improve Moscow\u2019s public spaces, turning them into hangouts for a young, creative class. Gorky Park, previously a rundown amusement park, had its carnival lights taken down in 2012 and now has new cycle lanes, with the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art opening there last year. For Kuznetsov, this is all forms a vision of a modern Moscow that is increasingly friendly to recreation in public space, of \u201cWI-FI everywhere\u201d and \u201ccrowded museums\u201d, where \u201crunning in the park has become normal\u201d.

Photograph: Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images    \u2018Soviet splendour\u2019 Dimitri Venkov, a 36-year-old film-maker based in Moscow, remembers the VDNKh of the 1990s as a \u201ctrashy hangout place\u201d defined by the \u201csmell of shashlik kebabs\u201d. \u201cIt was sad to see all the Soviet splendour given to merchants,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the Cosmos pavilion you had space, then they were selling cars there, which is a stark example of the decline of a civilisation.\u201d  Venkov is working on a project about Soviet filmmaking for an exhibition at VDNKh that will mark 2016 as the state\u2019s year of cinema.  When asked how much of VDNKh\u2019s restoration of Soviet iconography is rooted in a rehabilitation of the era\u2019s ideals, Venkov says: \u201cWe view the 1990s as more revolutionary times, when they toppled everything to build a new world. People wanted to get rid of the Soviet past, be friends with the whole world and love America, but in the 2000s with Putin the trend has been reversed.\u201d   Related: Russian city opens cultural centre celebrating Stalin    Venkov says while the \u201cwhole imperial idea\u201d is dangerous, there are positive aspects to this reassessment. \u201cStalin is coming back big time \u2013 he has a lot of supporters. But at the same time people think maybe the current system, capitalism, is not the best. \u201cMaybe we did have some good things there \u2013 education, healthcare \u2013 and maybe the state can do more for the people. The return of VDNKh and reorientation toward the cultural sphere is part of this trend.\u201d The Venice Architecture Biennale 2016 opens to the public on 28 May and runs until 27 November",
