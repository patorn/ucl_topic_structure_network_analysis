  "body": "Maria Bamford made her first call to a suicide helpline when she was at college. The US standup \u2013 who has dealt with anxiety, depression and unwanted thoughts all her life \u2013 gleefully uses the call in her act, even singing a song with the line: \u201cIf I clench my fists at odd intervals, the darknesses within me won\u2019t force me to do anything inappropriately violent or sexual at dinner parties!\u201d The number was composed on the advice of a therapist keen for Bamford \u201cto let her anxieties out\u201d. Bamford \u2013 Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cfavourite comedian on planet Earth\u201d and \u201can angel who got bored\u201d according to Marc Maron \u2013 is now branching out into sitcom, or rather meta-sitcom. Lady Dynamite, which debuts on Netflix this month, roughly tracks the major events of her life \u2013 in particular, being hospitalised three times for mental illness five years ago.   Related: Mae Martin on Maria Bamford: \u2018she brings a whole comedy cast to life\u2019    The tone of that anxiety-releasing song runs through Lady Dynamite, which features flashbacks to a hospital in Duluth, Minnesota, where we see Bamford make her group therapist cry during an ill-advised game of something called Truth Badminton. And that\u2019s before her agent sets her up with some strange jobs: advertising an apparently sexy new Japanese food called Pussy Noodle, voicing the character of Lady Orca in a Bill Cosby-produced cartoon about SeaWorld, and hosting a hilariously creepy game show called Lock Up a Broad. Outside of the workplace, we see her contemplating a date someone has set up for her. \u201cHe\u2019s bisexual,\u201d she\u2019s told. \u201cBut he also has a crippling meth addiction.\u201d Bamford doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cSounds good!\u201d The standup, now 45, found her first TV show a shocking change in pace: \u201cStandup is only an hour a day at the most. There were people working on the show who did not sit down once in 16 hours. I had to take an hour-long nap every day.\u201d These naps, she says, probably cost the production $5,000 apiece. \u201cI was the lightweight in the group,\u201d she goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s high energy, which is why the show is called Lady Dynamite. The funny thing about that is I have so little energy sometimes. I am not a super-energetic person.\u201d         Watch the trailer for Lady Dynamite    In the show, as in real life, Bamford installs a park bench outside her house in Los Angeles. It\u2019s there to engage the community and give the world at large a place to sit. She tries to do her bit whenever she can, volunteering at a women\u2019s centre and performing one-off standup shows. \u201cThere\u2019s a homeless centre at a church in our neighbourhood,\u201d she says. \u201cOver the winter we did a show for the people there. I felt kind of bad. I was like, \u2018Oh my god \u2013 this is just like a hostage situation.\u2019\u201d The show took an unexpected turn. \u201cThe people who were sleeping there got up and did their own standup, or songs and stuff. I was like, \u2018Well, I can see how that is much better than being performed for.\u2019 Because if you live in LA, you probably do want to perform. This one guy did three songs from The Love Boat, and he had a doll with him, which brought it to a more professional level. Lots of professional comics don\u2019t even practice their material. They don\u2019t have a set list, much less a doll.\u201d Bamford enjoys herself most when shows are \u201ceasy and supportive\u201d, often performing \u2013 despite being one of the hottest standups in the US \u2013 at a tiny local open-mic night called Pale Hydra. It takes place in the back of a coffee shop and is run \u201cby these three guys who know each other from high school\u201d.     High anxiety \u2026 Bamford, right, in Lady Dynamite. Photograph: Saeed Adyani/Netflix    She has, of late, developed a new, troubling thought. \u201cHave you noticed that there is an element of standup comedy happening in our politicians? Like, they\u2019re funny! I don\u2019t know if I should feel proud or concerned.\u201d As for the rise of Donald Trump, she says: \u201cWell, Hitler was popular. Trump seems like a happy guy \u2013 and terrifying. He doesn\u2019t seem to like women very much, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d get along with him. I feel like I should be protesting. Maybe this is the trampoline that gets me into protesting.\u201d She has a solution: she\u2019d rather the world was run by standups. \u201cComedians have some of the best foreign policy ideas ever,\u201d she says. \u201cInspired, inexpensive and non-violent solutions, like dropping porn in countries just to confuse people, or having a high school marching band enter a war zone. Things that bring joy, confusion \u2013 and a respite from the nonsense. That\u2019s what I like to call war: \u2018Nonsense.\u2019 World war three. World Nonsense. The Korean Nonsense.\u201d \u2022 Lady Dynamite is on Netflix from 20 May.",
