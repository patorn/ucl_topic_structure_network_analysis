  "body": "Anne Hathaway will reprise the role of a US air force pilot tasked with operating an unmanned drone in a film version of Grounded, a play she appeared in off-Broadway. The Oscar winner for Les Mis\u00e9rables will also produce the picture, according to Variety. Julie Taymor directed Hathaway in the 2015 production of the play by George Brant. No director has yet been locked for the film adaptation.  The one-woman play was first seen in Edinburgh in 2013 and off-Broadway in 2014, followed by Taymor\u2019s collaboration with Hathaway at the Public theatre in New York. Variety reports that Hathaway secured the film rights before her first performance, for which she later earned a nomination for a Critics Circle award.   Related: Grounded review \u2013 Anne Hathaway goes full throttle in one-woman show    The production received strong reviews at the time, with the Guardian\u2019s Alexis Soloski calling Hathaway\u2019s performance \u201cconsciously chameleonesque\u201d.  \u201cThe script demands a heightened performance, especially as the pilot grows increasingly unstrapped from observable reality, and Hathaway delivers,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMonomania is one of her specialties, and she goes full throttle here.\u201d The ethics of drone warfare were also the subject for Eye in the Sky, Gavin Hood\u2019s thriller starring Helen Mirren and the late Alan Rickman, which is one of the highest-grossing independent films of the year in the US. Hathaway will reappear as the White Queen in Alice Through the Looking Glass, Disney\u2019s sequel to Tim Burton\u2019s blockbuster Alice in Wonderland. She last starred in the Nancy Meyers\u2019 romantic comedy The Intern, opposite Robert De Niro.",
