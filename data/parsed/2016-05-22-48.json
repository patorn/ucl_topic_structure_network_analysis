  "body": "If the London Sevens were the Olympic rugby tournament in Rio, Scotland \u2013 read, Great Britain \u2013 would have taken the gold medal, South Africa silver and the USA bronze. Jarryd Hayne and Fiji would have gone home with nothing at all.   Related: Good luck to Jarryd Hayne on his latest adventure, but is it really a good idea? | Matt Cleary    The former San Francisco 49ers running back got on the field as Fiji lost 26-19 to the USA in the third-place game. The Eagles had lost to Scotland in the semi-final, ending their attempt to defend the title they won in 2015.  The tournament was the last on the HSBC Sevens World Series before rugby\u2019s return to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August. Fiji did enough to secure a second World Series title in a row, while Scotland caused a huge upset in a thrilling final against the Blitzbokke, winning 27-26. Hayne made the Fiji squad a week after his surprise \u201cretirement\u201d from the NFL. Used as a substitute throughout the event \u2013 though not in the semi-final defeat by South Africa \u2013 he said: \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m behind the eight ball and I\u2019ve got no problem with that. It\u2019s about working hard and getting there.  \u201cThey\u2019re the world champs. Sometimes in life, it\u2019s not about success, but it\u2019s about the experience and just being part of that team. \u201c[It is the] first Fijian team to win back-to-back titles and they\u2019ve got a bunch of superstars who are going to be a joy to train with and a joy to play with. It\u2019s not about coming over and making the team, it\u2019s about giving me an opportunity to make a team.\u201d Hayne now faces six weeks of intense training in Fiji to prove to coach Ben Ryan that he\u2019s not only fit enough for Rio, but good enough to displace one of the team\u2019s established stars. \u201cOur cupboard is not just deep, it\u2019s absolutely littered with fantastic talent,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe had a very light week this week ... when we\u2019re running up 100-metre sand dunes, when these guys are the fittest rugby players Fiji has ever had and they\u2019re still throwing up after sessions, his lactate\u2019s going to be going into overdrive. \u201cWhether he\u2019ll be able to tolerate that in a short timeframe is a serious question.\u201d Hayne had a huge amount to do to compete, Ryan said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a random side, this is the best side in the world in the last two years. A Fijian side that plays a very high-tempo, high-risk game that requires enormous amounts of skill and he has that, and enormous amounts of fitness, and he hasn\u2019t got that at the moment.\u201d    Looks like my Bula brother is still coming to grips with the running load of sevens lol @JarrydHayne pic.twitter.com/9CZPTqupRz\u2014 Sonny Bill Williams (@SonnyBWilliams) May 22, 2016    On Sunday, the USA had a startling 42-14 win over New Zealand and another multi-sport superstar aiming for an Olympic place, the erstwhile league and boxing standout Sonny Bill Williams. It was the Eagles\u2019 highest points total against the All Blacks Sevens, a team they beat for the first time ever in Dubai last year. There were four tries from the former football player Perry Baker, two in each half, and one each for Ben Pinkelman and Madison Hughes, who converted all six scores. Asked about the New Zealand win, USA coach Mike Friday said: \u201cThat was the sort of performance we\u2019re capable of if they listen and execute. We are a seriously dangerous team, we can hurt anyone on our day.  \u201cWe have to focus the full 14 minutes. This sevens game is brutal, absolutely ruthless, if you\u2019re not quite on your game.\u201d Of the defeat by Scotland, Friday said: \u201cWe were in control and it was an appalling two minutes, gift-wrapped, under the Christmas tree, whatever you want to call it, you name it they took it. \u201cBut my boys fully deserved that win against Fiji as we move into Olympic preparation.\u201d Looking towards the Olympics, Friday identified the Sunwolves flanker Andrew Duratolo, Saracens wing Chris Wyles and the injured Carlin Isles as players set to come back into contention.         Jarryd Hayne makes a try-saving tackle for Fiji against France.

Hayne\u2019s switch from San Francisco caused surprise in rugby union, rugby league and American football. It also led some to question whether he would be eligible for the Olympic Games under anti-doping regulations, given his recent residence in the non-compliant NFL.  He was cleared to play before the London tournament, and in a statement issued by World Rugby sought to underline his commitment to his new team. \u201cMy dad is Fijian and we watched a lot of [Waisale] Serevi games,\u201d he said naming the greatest sevens player of all time, \u201cand William Ryder was a big idol of mine.  \u201cI have always dreamt about playing sevens for Fiji and I\u2019ve been given the opportunity.\u201d  The Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",
