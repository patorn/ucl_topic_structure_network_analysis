Lynch-Robinson joined Top Gear as director three years ago and has gone with the reprobate Jeremy Clarkson, along with his delinquent colleagues James May and Richard Hammond, to make their Amazon show, The Grand Tour. \u201cEvans is having a hard time. In an ideal world, they would have taken a bit of a holiday, but the international sales are so important that they couldn\u2019t.\u201d Top Gear is more than a money\u2011spinner for BBC2; the truth of it is, whatever you thought of the Gearists, and I generally thought they were jerks, this was populism done so popular that it lifted the whole channel. \u201cWhen we bother, we can do mainstream better than anyone.\u201d But of course it\u2019s true, too, that the brand is said to be worth \u00a350m to the corporation, and firing Clarkson didn\u2019t leave the BBC many options. The question is, can the show survive without him? And what on earth did he do to make it what it was? Top Gear started in 1977. It was, as Angela Rippon \u2013 the first presenter \u2013 recalls precisely, a trace of impatience in her voice, \u201ca magazine motoring show. I\u2019m a journalist and a broadcaster, and I just did the job of being a motoring journalist.\u201d I\u2019d just asked her about the Sun\u2019s story, a year ago, which reported that she thought the programme was too macho and they should give the job back to her. \u201cNewspapers, and I say this with great respect, I\u2019m a journalist myself, they don\u2019t always write what you say. I\u2019ve always said, \u2018No, I should not be the new presenter, because the programme has moved on. It\u2019s metamorphosed into something quite different to the show I presented, which is why it survived.\u2019\u201d It is as different now to the Top Gear she presented, she says, as Strictly Come Dancing is to the Come Dancing that she presented in the late 80s/90s.

Photograph: Ellis O\u2019Brien/BBC/PA Wire    Top Gear then wasn\u2019t for petrol heads so much \u2013 by Rippon\u2019s definition, \u201cPeople who want to take the darn things apart and put them back together again\u201d, but rather, people like her. \u201cI\u2019m somebody who loves driving, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, as long as I put a key in the ignition and it all happens under the bonnet, I\u2019m perfectly happy. I\u2019m only interested in the power and the torque and so on in so far as it gives me a good drive.\u201d A third category \u2013 people who like to see cars broken and set fire to, people who like lame 90s wordplay and the risque tightrope of Alf Garnett humour \u2013 had not yet been discovered. Magazine shows generally were quite consumer-dad: staid affairs for aspirational yet reliable people. It wasn\u2019t personality-driven, and a list of the presenters, apart from Rippon and Noel Edmonds, reads like the answers to the world\u2019s hardest pub quiz. Clarkson joined in 1988, and the blossoming of the persona is quite remarkable. He started out nothing short of plummy, in a sports coat, describing cars in the rather colourless terms of the true enthusiast, people to whom the length of the driver\u2019s door matters. He grew into himself over the decade, to become the kind of person to whom parliamentary select committees object: in 1999, the Commons environment, transport and regional affairs select committee blamed the programme, in part, for being \u201cobsessed with acceleration and speed: their producers should remember that such macho posturing might be acceptable on private roads but not on crowded streets.\u201d It is an extraordinary snapshot of the political mood, when for some reason nobody talked about anything important, it was all Millennium domes and bullish TV presenters and the justice or otherwise of fictional people being imprisoned in soap operas, the self-righteous triviality somehow making the paternalism harder to stomach.

Photograph: John Rogers/BBC Worldwide    Clarkson, when he resigned the same year, was diplomatic: \u201cThe shock tactics had become predictable and so weren\u2019t shocking any more,\u201d he wrote in a column for Top Gear magazine, going on to display something like self-deprecation. \u201cAnd it was the same with the metaphors. The first time you heard me liken some car to the best bits of Cameron Diaz, you probably sniggered about it at school all the next day. But now, it\u2019s tedious.\u201d Look, he probably meant that at the time. It is pretty rare for a programme to stand or fall by one personality, and the death of the first iteration of Top Gear could be traced back to deeper problems than Clarkson\u2019s departure, the main one being that it was boring. It had built up some pretty good viewing figures on the back of Clarkson\u2019s USP \u2013 when he\u2019s rude, he\u2019s incredibly rude. Yet it was locked into its format: it was a magazine show about cars, and should talk about cars without digression for people who were interested in that kind of thing. In 2001, the BBC decided to \u201crest\u201d it, and that should have been that.     Legendary Top Gear driver, the Stig. Photograph: Todd Antony/BBC    Producer Andy Wilman and Clarkson went back with their new format in 2002; even though the viewing figures, certainly at the start, were similar to or lower than those of its first incarnation, and although many of the segment ideas weren\u2019t exactly ideas so much as the mildest wordplay that might emerge from one and a half pints, it immediately had character. It had Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, and Stig, and its own aircraft hangar where you could really make a mess. It was puckish, delinquent, by the second series it had the Clarkson/May/Hammond chemistry, and it was no longer really about cars, any more than a war movie is about guns \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be fun without the guns, but it\u2019s really about comradeship. The lore on the production team was that the further away the films got from the car, the worse they got; but it was accepted nonetheless that it wasn\u2019t about the car. \u201cWhen people ask me what I do,\u201d Lynch-Robinson says, \u201cI tell people I\u2019m a holiday organiser for 12-year-old men. Men in general don\u2019t really get much more mature after the age of 12, they pretend they do if they have a real job, but in actual fact, we\u2019re all 12-year-olds. So they can be stupid and lark about and be naughty, and rebel against the teacher \u2013 which was the BBC \u2013 and they can have that silliness that 12-year-olds have. That\u2019s why it appeals to kids.\u201d Children, for people who aren\u2019t familiar with them, will watch anything, so it would be a mistake to read too much into the fact that David Cameron\u2019s daughter, for instance, threatened to go on hunger strike when Clarkson was fired. But it is undeniable that the show reached its tendrils far beyond what you might expect, if you ran a focus group on \u201ccars\u201d + \u201cblokes\u201d + \u201cbig trousers\u201d.     Top Gear attempts to drive across the Channel in 2007. Photograph: Rex Features    \u201cThe surprising thing,\u201d Lynch-Robinson says, \u201cwas that we almost had as big a female audience as the male. It was a massive female audience, and no one could really work that out, but I always thought the honesty of them being silly was a big part of that. Also, we did a lot of cock jokes but we never did boobs and Page 3, it was never that, it was never girls with their boobs out. It was very much about three blokes enjoying each other\u2019s company.\u201d People who worked on the show always insist, on and off the record, that there was never a trace of racism or bigotry; rather, that whenever there was a controversial remark \u2013 the \u201cslope on the bridge\u201d, the reversion to the old version of eeny, meeny, miny, mo \u2013 it was just deliberate chain-yanking, trolling a culture in which blokes could no longer be blokes because they had to think about people\u2019s feelings the whole time. It\u2019s not really about race any more than Page 3 is about sex: rather, it\u2019s about sending a message to the kind of people who object to that kind of thing, deliberately baiting them for trying to curtail your power. This, I think, is at the root of his popularity, the source of those million signatures telling the BBC to reinstate him: he is more than a cheeky japester. He serves to protest the outrages perpetrated against the honest white guy, who used to be able to call people slopes and mean no harm. In a way, he was performing a national service, the kind of release valve that prevents a Donald Trump from happening here. His foreign audience, incidentally, can\u2019t really understand what we have against him; it is taken to be a peculiarly English thing, picking over the utterances of someone you know is going to offend you a lot, but never quite enough.     Richard Hammond ... what really ignited Top Gear\u2019s popularity was his near-death crash in 2006. Photograph: BBC    Yet what really ignited Top Gear\u2019s popularity, setting it on course to become the most watched factual programme in the world in 2013, was not Clarkson\u2019s personality; rather, Hammond nearly killing himself in 2006. Since he was travelling at 288 miles an hour, his survival is remarkable, and the mere existence of Total Wipeout must take its proper place as \u201cmiracle TV\u201d. His next appearance \u2013 several months later \u2013 brought in eight million viewers, which, Rippon generously reminds us, is much more momentous than it would have been in the 80s: \u201cThe number of people who would have watched our programme was quite, quite different because they didn\u2019t have anything else to watch.\u201d It was post 2007 that the trio became really untouchable, their popularity so intense that to get fired a person would literally have to punch an underling in the face; and, probably relatedly, most of the controversies date from after this time. The irresponsible north pole race, the outrageous slurs against Mexicans and lorry drivers; it could all be read either as the impunity of the national treasure, or the desperate ante-upping of the star who feels it can\u2019t last. Either way, it didn\u2019t: but they can all perhaps take solace from the toxic swamp they left behind.     Their popularity became so intense that to get fired a person would literally have to punch an underling in the face ... Clarkson. Photograph: Ana Poenariu/AFP/Getty Images    It could simply be that Evans isn\u2019t popular with former colleagues, that he genuinely doesn\u2019t get on with LeBlanc, that there truly are people who object to LeBlanc leaving tyre marks round the Cenotaph, one of whom authentically is Evans. It\u2019s entirely possible that the new show is beset by tribulations totally unrelated to its predecessor, just a set of impossible personalities, endlessly clashing. LeBlanc, in an interview with the Radio Times, popped with outrage at the \u201cruthlessness\u201d of the British press. \u201cAll this stuff that Chris and I are at war with each other is a big load of bullshit. We\u2019ve never had a rift! I\u2019m a true car fan, Chris is a true car fan. We\u2019re just hanging out, having a laugh, doing our best.\u201d But the shadow of Clarkson is longer and darker than anything that could ever be cast by the man himself, there in the splenetic petition signing and hunger striking of his myriad fans. You wouldn\u2019t wish this legacy on a dog. But it was always impossible to call, what people loved about Clarkson between his silliness and his rage; if it was his anger, both the BBC\u2019s Top Gear and his own new show will bomb. And if it was his silliness, one daft moment from each and they will both net millions of viewers, who will just have to adapt by watching more telly.",
