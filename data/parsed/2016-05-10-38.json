Yes, that\u2019s right, Tom Brady\u2019s cookbook: an 89-recipe tome written by an NFL quarterback that costs $200. It\u2019s proved to be a big hit \u2013 and further copies won\u2019t be available for another month at least. Brady\u2019s snappily-titled \u201cTB12 Nutrition Manual\u201d, available for purchase on the Patriots QB\u2019s personal website at an attractive $200 on the nose, is out of stock, so those of you itching to find out which of the freshest ingredients Tom loves to cook with will just have to wait a little longer.   Related: The NFL and Tom Brady need to cut a deal and kill Deflategate for good | Les Carpenter    The website describes its culinary offering as a \u201climited-edition \u2018living document\u2019 containing information about our core TB12 nutritional philosophies and featuring a library of 89 seasonally-inspired recipes that you can use to support your TB12-aligned nutrition plan.\u201d But why so expensive? Is it made of gold? Well, no. But it is is \u201cprinted and hand assembled in the United States, and is printed on thick 100lb text paper. The covers are made from natural wood with a laser-etched TB12 logo and title.\u201d How\u2019s that for novelty: a cookbook with a wooden cover. And that\u2019s not all. \u201cPlease note also that as we periodically update this manual with new or modified recipes, we will send additional pages to all purchasers of the manual.\u201d Which translates as: we\u2019ll keep sending you recipes for the rest of eternity. Brady should have plenty of time to perfect his skills in the kitchen: he\u2019ll miss the first four games of the NFL season after his Deflategate ban was upheld last month. Brady\u2019s personal chef Allen Campbell revealed in January that Brady eats \u201c80%\u201d vegetables. He also goes in for brown rice, quinoa, millet and beans \u2013 but no sugar, coffee, dairy or tomatoes. Why tomatoes? \u201cThey cause inflammation,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cNo white sugar,\u201d Campbell told Boston.com in January. \u201cNo white flour. No MSG. I\u2019ll use raw olive oil, but I never cook with olive oil. I only cook with coconut oil. Fats like canola oil turn into trans fats I use Himalayan pink salt as the sodium. I never use iodized salt. \u201c[Tom] doesn\u2019t eat nightshades, because they\u2019re not anti-inflammatory. So no tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, or eggplants. Tomatoes trickle in every now and then, but just maybe once a month. I\u2019m very cautious about tomatoes. They cause inflammation. \u201cWhat else? No coffee. No caffeine. No fungus. No dairy. The kids eat fruit. Tom, not so much. He will eat bananas in a smoothie. But otherwise, he prefers not to eat fruits.\u201d Looks like Brady won\u2019t be taking the kids to White Castle this weekend, then. Brady posted a picture from the book on his Facebook page, calling it \u201canother step toward achieving your peak performance.\u201d But all copies are final sale. \u201cPlease note that due to its unique content and binding, all sales of the TB12 Nutrition Manual are final sale \u2013 the manual can not be returned or exchanged.\u201d At $200, Brady\u2019s cookbook isn\u2019t even the most expensive book written by someone in his family. His wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen sold a $700 coffee-table book back in November. It too sold out.",
