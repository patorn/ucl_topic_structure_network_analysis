  "body": "Andy Murray survived a draining examination by 37-year-old Radek Stepanek to squeeze into the second round of the French Open on Tuesday \u2013 and then he addressed a court of an altogether different kind to bury the myth that Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo had quit as his coach because of his on-court behaviour.   Related: Andy Murray fights back to beat Stepanek in five sets at French Open    After wrapping up unfinished business with the Czech \u2013 the oldest of a record 51 over-30 players in the draw \u2013 3-6, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3, 7-5, Murray turned to his other recent \u201cproblem\u201d in what was never going to be a mundane press conference. In front of a rapt audience of media inquisitors \u2013 some of whom he clearly has viewed with suspicion in recent days \u2013 the world No2 calmly deconstructed the tale of what had grown organically from just another professional break-up into one of the great sporting divorces of modern times. \u201cMe and Am\u00e9lie have a very good relationship,\u201d he said of the Parisian who left him in Madrid earlier this month and whom he hopes to meet at some time during the tournament, \u201cand I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to try to say otherwise.\u201d Pointing out that an interview with him in L\u2019Equipe on Monday was recorded before hers appeared in the same paper last Saturday, Murray wanted to correct the impression that such a false juxtaposition gave that he was trying to get square with her. \u201cI did an interview before the tournament, before anything that Am\u00e9lie had said had come out,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd the last two days [it] was supposedly that I was hitting back at Am\u00e9lie\u2019s comments and disagreeing with everything that she said and that we had a really tough break-up. That simply is not true.   Related: Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo: Andy Murray\u2019s on-court behaviour played part in split    \u201cAnyone who said [their recent chat in Madrid] was heated is lying and was not there. It was far from heated. We spoke very calmly the whole time. To say that the reason that we stopped working together is because of my behaviour on the court, that is not true. In Madrid when we spoke, we didn\u2019t discuss that one time. \u201cFor sure, when we were working together, we discussed many things on the court. And there were times when \u2013 like with all of my coaches \u2013 they said, \u2018You need to concentrate more on the match. Stop directing your frustration at the box and being distracted from what\u2019s going on on the court.\u2019 But to say that that\u2019s why we stopped working together is untrue. \u201cObviously what\u2019s happened the last few days has been difficult, because I didn\u2019t have a chance to talk about it or respond or anything. What I said about my on-court behaviour [in the pre-tournament interview] was not in response to what came out. The article hadn\u2019t even come out when I answered those questions.\u201d  It appears Mauresmo found the travelling too stressful, which would be perfectly understandable, yet she did not forward that as a reason. Murray explained: \u201cWhat was said at the time was that we literally are spending hardly any time together in a three-month period right before major events coming up. And she was not able to help me during that period. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d If that has properly laid the matter to rest \u2013 and who knows what else might emerge? \u2013 Murray should be able to move on and make serious inroads here, given his recent excellent form on clay. Certainly he can leave behind the dip he experienced against Stepanek, who is ranked 129 in the world and returning to the Tour after nine months out last year with a back injury. Murray has a much softer assignment on Wednesday against the 22-year-old French wild card Mathias Bourgue, who took nearly three and half hours to beat the Spanish qualifier Jordi Samper-Monta\u00f1a as well as cramp in three close sets on his Roland Garros debut on Monday. Murray and Stepanek resumed with the Scot 4-2 up and serving in the fourth set in front of a thinly peopled main court (one of the downsides of post-lunch matches here). The Czech drew on all the skill and trickery he has accumulated over 21 years on the Tour to wrong-foot Murray frequently with changes of pace and direction, as well as the occasional drop shot. But he could not sustain his defiance under building pressure and billowed the net with a weary concluding volley.

Jamie Delgado, his assistant coach, and Matt Little, his conditioner, were particularly vocal in their support. Murray said later: \u201cIt could turn out to be one of the biggest wins of my career. But it easily could have gone the other way. When it is pretty much one set to stay in the tournament, you have to have as much energy, intensity as you can. I\u2019m glad that my team\u2019s right behind me in situations like that.\u201d In less troubled waters on Court 14 Aljaz Bedene joined Murray and Kyle Edmund in the second round, the first trio of British men to reach that stage since 1975, after beating the Austrian left-hander Gerald Melzer 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. He had Murray\u2019s long-time confidant and Great Britain Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith, in his box.Bedene next plays the Spaniard Pablo Carre\u00f1o, who beat Federico Delbonis, the 31st seed, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4 in nearly three-and-a-half hours on Court 18. John Isner, meanwhile, booked a second-round match against Edmund when he beat the British player\u2019s fellow Liverpool supporter, the Australian John Millman, 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 7-5 in three hours and 20 minutes.",
