Gergiev took to the stage on Thursday, at 5pm Moscow time, with musicians from St Petersburg\u2019s Mariinsky orchestra. The concert was titled With a Prayer from Palmyra: Music Revives the Ancient Walls. Joining him as part of an official delegation was the cellist Sergei Roldugin, who is the artistic director of St Petersburg\u2019s House of Music and Vladimir Putin\u2019s best friend. Last month the Panama Papers revealed that Roldugin was the beneficiary of hundreds of millions of dollars in offshore deals.      Sergei Roldugin with Vladimir Putin.

The concert also featured works by Prokofiev and Bach. Roldugin\u2019s trip to Palmyra is the strongest sign yet that he continues to enjoy official favour. The audience included Syrian and Russian soldiers. Putin was beamed in live from Sochi. In an address broadcast from a video screen on the main stage, Putin hailed the operation to \u201cliberate Palmyra\u201d. He said the concert was dedicated to the victims of \u201cinternational terrorism\u201d, which he called a \u201cterrible evil.\u201d Dressed in a black shirt, and wearing a white baseball cap to protect him from the sun, Gergiev said: \u201cWe protest against barbarians who destroyed wonderful monuments of world culture. We protest against the execution of people here on this great stage.\u201d  The concert got blanket coverage from Russian state TV channels. They have portrayed Moscow\u2019s intervention in Syria \u2013 its first outside the borders of the Soviet Union since the cold war \u2013 as a humanitarian action against terrorists.

Rights groups, however, say Russian jets have killed about 2,000 people over the past six months, with attacks on markets, hospitals and schools. Gergiev, the former principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, is a controversial and outspoken supporter of Putin. Gergiev warmly endorsed Putin\u2019s candidacy before Russia\u2019s 2012 presidential election. He has also backed official moves to ban what Moscow says is \u201cgay propaganda\u201d. The conductor has appeared previously on other big patriotic occasions. In 2008, he conducted Shostakovich\u2019s Leningrad Symphony No 7 in the ruined South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali. This followed a disastrous attempt by Georgia\u2019s Mikheil Saakashvili to seize back the rebel territory, which triggered a punitive Russian invasion. In 2013, the human rights activist Peter Tatchell gatecrashed the opening night of the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s Berlioz season at the Barbican to protest against the conductor\u2019s backing for Putin. \u201cGergiev is a great conductor but he colludes with a tyrant,\u201d Tatchell told the LSO audience.  The following year Gergiev popped up at the closing ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics, conducting the Russian national anthem.

The official delegation included Mikhail Piotrovsky, the director of St Petersburg\u2019s Hermitage museum, and the son of a distinguished archaeologist. Representatives from Zimbabwe, China and Serbia also attended. The concert took place in the same Roman theatre used by Islamic State in November to execute captured Syrian soldiers. Teenage Isis recruits shot the soldiers from close range in the back of the head. Their bodies were later found in a mass grave.

Other important archaeological ruins, such as the theatre and the Agora, survived.  Experts said the destruction at the Unesco-listed site was not as bad as they had originally feared. Russian combat engineers cleared much of the sprawling desert site, defusing mines and using state-of-the-art robotic devices.",
