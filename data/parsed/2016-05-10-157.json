  "body": "It is estimated that more than half of Kenya\u2019s population earning less than $2.50 (\u00a31.73) per day has access to mobile phones. Kenya\u2019s remarkable growth in mobile technology has led to a digital revolution that can address one of the country\u2019s biggest development priorities \u2013 access to universal health coverage.  In Kenya, 22 million people pay out of pocket for private healthcare, and access to these services remains a major concern for those living at the bottom of the economic pyramid (BoP), especially in remote rural areas.  Inclusive business models, which aim to include poor people throughout companies\u2019 value chains, are providing a wide spectrum of healthcare services for those at the BoP, ranging from accessible health insurance to primary healthcare, facilitated by new technologies such as mobile money platforms.    Related: Being a woman business owner offers unusual challenges but great reward    According to a recent publication (pdf) commissioned by the Business Call to Action (BCtA), a global advocacy platform for inclusive business, mobile money technology can offer a wide array of benefits for the health sector, ranging from improved efficiency and financial accountability for businesses to increased access to healthcare financing for consumers \u2013 especially those at the BoP.  The findings of the publication, which included four case studies from Kenya, were recently discussed at a meeting co-hosted by the BCtA and the Private Sector Innovation Programme for Health (PSP4H), a research project funded by UK aid. The meeting, held in Nairobi, Kenya, brought together 100 representatives across sectors. \u201cDespite the role that technology can play in helping to reach new clients and facilitate transactions, it is only part of the solution to advance access to health insurance at the base of the pyramid\u201d, explained Tughral Ali, head of MicroEnsure Africa. MicroEnsure, a global social enterprise and microinsurance technology provider, entered the Kenyan market with a freemium insurance product \u2013 which clients can later complement with additional low-cost cover \u2013 tailored to the customers of mobile network operator Airtel.  According to Ali, lack of awareness and understanding of insurance are the key challenges for bringing microinsurance products and companies to scale. Sam Agutu, CEO of Changamka MicroHealth Ltd, added that relevant communications tailored to target clients play a critical role: \u201cThe average Kenyan living at the base of the economic pyramid is no stranger to risk pooling \u2013 there are traditional ways to risk pool in communities in the event of sickness. The question is how we transform informal into formal insurance. In order to raise awareness about the benefits of formal insurance, we need to use concepts that are already understood in communications and marketing.\u201d Another challenge in scaling microinsurance is a lack of trust. \u201cCustomers at the base of the pyramid are cost-conscious and selective \u2013 you need to prove that formal insurance products work and that they work better than traditional risk pooling\u201d, added Agutu.

According to John Paul Otieno, Jawabu\u2019s CEO, the company plans to enlist peer entrepreneurs as trusted agents to sell its insurance product, known as Afya Poa (pdf).  Jawabu used market research to develop a product whose premium payments match informal worker\u2019s earning patterns. Policies are sold via mobile phones for a minimum KSh 1,000 (\u00a36) down payment and a daily payment of KSh 40 (31p), automatically deducted from the policy holder\u2019s mobile phone credit. In addition, Otieno considers the provision of complimentary products, such as medical savings accounts and healthcare loans, critical to address the needs and preferences of the company\u2019s target customers. Bundling mobile money-based products such as insurance and healthcare savings accounts with complementary services including health information and reminders can keep clients engaged and increase the uptake of services. According to Janet Matemu, technology manager at Jacaranda Health, sending reminders about upcoming appointments through mobile phones has increased the use of Jacaranda\u2019s services. As a social enterprise offering affordable maternal healthcare services in peri-urban Nairobi, they\u2019re leveraging mobile money-based savings products to help clients access health financing.  Mobile technology has also provided Jacaranda opportunities to engage more effectively with clients and support them in seeking critical post-natal care. \u201cSimple checklists sent by text messages can help new mothers spot potential problems in their child\u2019s development and seek timely care\u201d, continued Matemu.   Related: Skills training and apprenticeships tackle Kenya\u2019s high youth unemployment    In addition to reaching clients and facilitating access to healthcare financing, mobile technology can also increase accountability and efficiency, and inform decision making. According to Matemu, \u201cTechnology is driving the organisational culture of using data for decision making.\u201d Ideally, data gathered by the private sector and civil society could also feed into national health systems to inform decision making in the public sector.  Recognising the potential of using technology for healthcare delivery, Dr. Izak Odongo, representing the Ministry of Health, said that Kenya\u2019s government is keen to establish an enabling regulatory environment that encourages innovation in utilising mobile technology to improve the health of Kenyans.
