  "body": "Name: Eastbourne. Appearance: Seasidey. Age: About 150 years old. Like most of its residents, eh? Get it? Because people move there when they retire and \u2026 Yes, I understand the joke. But it\u2019s rather out of date. Like many coastal towns in the south, Eastbourne has been getting younger and groovier. The band Toploader were formed there. Um, yes. You can\u2019t get much groovier than that. I suppose I can see why young people might want to live where they can frolic on the beach, where they and their eventual children can breathe the fresh sea air. Yeah. Um. Except, actually, that\u2019s out of date as well. Eastbourne has some of the worst air pollution in the country. What? How? Half of it is sea. I know. It\u2019s all rather embarrassing, especially as the cover of this year\u2019s Visit Eastbourne brochure reads: \u201cBreathe it in.\u201d So, what\u2019s going on? Well, according to the World Health Organisation, among all the towns in the UK, Eastbourne has the third-highest levels of very small particulates in the air, and the seventh-highest of slightly bigger ones. It\u2019s at least as bad as London, and fractionally worse than Scunthorpe, which is a big steel town. Only Glasgow is decidedly smoggier. Worse than Scunthorpe! What\u2019s going on in Eastbourne? Do Toploader constantly ride around in a coal-fired steamer? They may do. I haven\u2019t heard much about them lately. But no, that isn\u2019t the problem. Didn\u2019t Eastbourne pier burn down? Part of it did, yes, but that was two years ago, so the smoke has probably dispersed by now. The problem is other people. Isn\u2019t it always! I keep saying that, but they don\u2019t listen. Yeah, well, in Eastbourne\u2019s case, it\u2019s true. There\u2019s no heavy industry in the town, and only about 100,000 people, but they happen to be in just the wrong place, where wisps of smog drift over from London and from the continent. Brexit! Let\u2019s do a Brexit! That won\u2019t fix the problem, I\u2019m afraid. Smog doesn\u2019t need a passport. Besides, EU air pollution laws have been forcing our reluctant governments to tackle the problem (a bit). Still, at least Eastbourne is the sunniest town in Britain. Unless Hastings is. Which it is, according to Hastings. Do say: \u201cLet\u2019s attack France and make it cut its pollution!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cWith special low-emission battleships!\u201d",
