Anyone, regardless of \u201cage, gender or skin colour\u201d is entitled to celebrate the late musician, the singer wrote on Instagram. Madonna performed Nothing Compares 2 U and a duet with Stevie Wonder of Purple Rain. Her interpretation of the late artist\u2019s music was met with disdain in some circles. \u201cAnyone who wants to do a tribute to Prince is welcome to,\u201d Madonna posted the following day on Instagram. \u201cIf you loved him and he inspired you then show it!!!! I love Prince 4 ever.\u201d           Madonna and Stevie Wonder pay tribute to Prince at Billboard Music Awards    Not everyone was critical of the tribute. Questlove, who helped to orchestrate the Prince section of the Billboard ceremony, praised Madonna\u2019s performance. In a series of tweets, the Roots drummer and the Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon bandleader said people who were sceptical of Madonna\u2019s moment were still processing the pop icon\u2019s death. \u201cBecause of P\u2019s well-known love for the *poof* vanishing act, a lot of us are left feeling incomplete in the act of saying goodbye.\u201d He added: \u201cNaturally, there will be folded arms & shade thrown because the Purple Standard is hard boots to fill & a lot of us don\u2019t wanna come 2 grips.\u201d He said that fans should be prepared for an onslaught of tributes at other awards shows over the coming year. \u201cEvery Prince rendition will not be a life changing orgasmic xperience. Just to SING his work is brave enough. Again feeling are on high.\u201d Prince played guitar on three songs from Madonna\u2019s 1989 album Like a Prayer. Their relationship, however, was considered tumultuous. During a concert in London in 2007, Prince said: \u201cI got so many hits y\u2019all can\u2019t handle me. I got more hits than Madonna\u2019s got kids.\u201d",
