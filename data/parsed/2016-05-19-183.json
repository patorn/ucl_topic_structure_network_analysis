  "body": "Perhaps for the first time \u2013 and almost certainly for the last, since he is about to retire \u2013 Lord Toulson is the hero of the press. As the sole dissenting judge in the supreme court ruling on the current celebrity injunction of speculation, he would have allowed the claimant\u2019s name to be published \u2013 at least by news organisations that were prepared to run the risk of paying damages for breaching the claimant\u2019s privacy.   Related: Supreme court upholds 'celebrity threesome' injunction    As Toulson rightly said, the court must live in the world as it is, and not as it would like it to be. \u201cThe story in its essential details has been published in a major Scottish newspaper, it has been widely accessible on websites and Twitter, and anyone who seriously wanted to know [the celebrity\u2019s identity] will have ways of finding it,\u201d the judge explained. \u201cConfidentiality in a meaningful sense can survive a certain amount of leakage, and every case must be decided on its own facts; but in this case I have reached a clear view that the story\u2019s confidentiality has become so porous that the idea of it still remaining secret in a meaningful sense is illusory.\u201d As for the celebrity couple\u2019s children, whose interests were explored by Lady Hale in a short judgment of her own, Toulson pointed out that they were very young and could be shielded from immediate publicity. Hale maintained that there was \u201call the difference in the world between the sort of wall-to-wall publicity and intrusion\u201d that would have followed if the injunction had been lifted now and the children learning the information in due course \u2013 which the court of appeal had thought inevitable. That may be so. But the younger the children are when that story breaks, the less they are likely to be affected by it. What counts, of course, is the majority opinion \u2013 delivered by Lord Mance on behalf of himself, Hale, Lord Neuberger and Lord Reed. Reinstating the temporary order until the case can be argued in full at a future hearing, Mance said that if the price of applying the law was being described by the Daily Mail as \u201can ass\u201d, it was a price that must be paid. \u201cThe court is well aware of the lesson [that] King Canute gave his courtiers,\u201d said Mance. \u201cUnlike Canute, the court can take steps to enforce its injunction pending trial.\u201d But can it? Although this is a ruling by the supreme court of the United Kingdom, it applies only in England and Wales. And it will be observed only by the mainstream media, however hard the celebrity\u2019s lawyers try to block searches on Google and elsewhere. You have to admire Mance\u2019s logic. Explaining his ruling at a brief hearing, he said there was no public interest in publishing kiss-and-tell stories, however much they might interest some members of the public and even if they involved infidelity or multiple encounters. It was different if the story had some bearing on performance of a public office or involved correcting a misleading impression cultivated by the person concerned. But that was not the case here. Mance went on to say that lifting the injunction now would largely undermine the purpose of the planned trial \u2013 which would then be limited to a decision on whether the celebrity was entitled to damages for the assumed breach of his privacy. But Toulson had an answer to that too. \u201cWhile adequacy of damages as a remedy is a reason to refuse an injunction, you cannot turn the argument on its head and say that inadequacy of damages is a positive reason to grant an otherwise inappropriate injunction.\u201d Still, we have to thank the celebrity and his spouse \u2013 as well as News Group Newspapers, publishers of the Sun on Sunday \u2013 for funding the development of the law that the supreme court\u2019s judgment represents. We now know that section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 \u2013 which was introduced late in the bill\u2019s parliamentary progress in an attempt to appease the media \u2013 does not mean what it says. Far from requiring the courts to give \u201cparticular regard to the importance of \u2026 freedom of expression\u201d \u2013 which is what it says and what the appeal court thought it meant \u2013 section 12 makes no difference to the wider principle that in balancing privacy against freedom of expression neither right has preference over the other. We also now know that the court of appeal was wrong to identify even a limited public interest in the disclosure of alleged sexual infidelity by public figures. Mance quoted with approval a point made by Lord Lester QC in a recent memoir: commercial pressures to publish salacious gossip must not drive newspapers to violate proper standards of journalism. Mance was well aware that he would be accused of being \u201cirredentist\u201d \u2013 trying to restore lost territory. He also expected to be criticised for \u201cgiving undue protection to a tawdry story\u201d. And he acknowledged the risk of further social media publicity \u201caimed at making the court\u2019s injunction seem vain\u201d. At one level, he and the judges who agreed with him deserve some respect for refusing to succumb when court orders are circumvented. The Sun on Sunday\u2019s attempt to get the injunction lifted has not only landed it with a likely costs order but also left it with the blame for effectively limiting the freedom of the press. But Toulson\u2019s arguments remain the more convincing. Judges need to be very cautious about granting injunctions to prevent publication of what is widely known, Toulson said. Otherwise, the court may \u201close public respect for the law by giving the appearance of being out of touch with reality\u201d. Comments were briefly opened in error on this piece.
