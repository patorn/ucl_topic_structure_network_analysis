If there is, He doesn\u2019t seem to pipe up that often with concrete advice. The same cannot be said for the man some consider His slayer, Richard Dawkins. He is possessed of all the certainty I look for in the Almighty and his truth is a lot more effable. God is dead, long live God. In the apparent absence of omniscience, I\u2019ll settle for a know-all. So I was glad to hear that the revered professor had spoken out about the forthcoming EU referendum, a subject that has made me feel particularly lost, baffled and afraid lately. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, I know how I\u2019m going to vote \u2013 I\u2019m for Remain. I\u2019m unshakable on that. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m right. And I also don\u2019t know if the side I\u2019m going to vote for will win. I fear the consequences of its defeat and, to a lesser but still significant extent, I fear the consequences of its victory. I\u2019m not finding any of this much fun. But Dawkins\u2019s words gave me solace. He said: \u201cIt is an outrage that people as ignorant as me are being asked to vote. This is a complicated matter of economics, politics, history, and we live in a representative democracy not a plebiscite democracy. You could make a case for having plebiscites on certain issues \u2013 I could imagine somebody arguing for one on fox hunting, for example \u2013 but not on something as involved as the European Union. This should be a matter for parliament.\u201d    I was comforted by the thought that Dawkins, too, longs for the intercession of a greater power: not God, but government    Goal! Hear hear! Amen. That is so totally what I think, but I didn\u2019t realise until I heard it. It was a wondrous epiphany. If the man can work such miracles, maybe there is no God. And I was comforted by the thought that Dawkins, too, longs for the intercession of a greater power: not God, but government. In Britain we get to choose our leaders, and dismiss them if we\u2019re disappointed by the direction they\u2019ve led us in. But we must surely reserve our bitterest disappointment for leaders who refuse to lead us anywhere at all.     Illustration by David Foldvari.    Calling this referendum is the worst thing Cameron has done to Britain. It\u2019s such a hugely selfish and irresponsible act that I can hardly believe we\u2019ve wasted so long talking about how he\u2019s eviscerating the NHS, attacking the BBC and slashing disability benefits when, horrendous though those developments are, this crime is much greater because its consequences could be irreversible. The issues surrounding Britain\u2019s membership of the EU are complicated. The EU\u2019s problems, its waste and questionable democratic accountability, are clear. So are its trade advantages and the transformation of Europe under its influence from the world\u2019s most murderous war zone, in which each generation strove to slaughter in greater numbers than its predecessor, to a largely peaceful continent. Crucially, the EU has made the prospect of a war between France and Germany unthinkable. Few people in 1945 would fail to be amazed and overjoyed by such an achievement. Maybe the EU\u2019s flaws are leading inexorably to tyranny. Or maybe imperialist and xenophobic emotions within Britain are luring us into a self-defeating isolation that will insult our neighbours and make us poorer. These are just the quandaries that come up when you think about it for five minutes. The deeper you get into it, the more terrifying questions arise. What is the point in politicians if it isn\u2019t to give clear answers to those questions? To understand the broad truth that this country wants to continue to exist independently, but also wants to accept global realities enough to protect its prosperity, and then make a bloody decision? Yet both major parties are, to a certain extent, divided on the issue \u2013 the party of government disastrously so. Cameron has structured his whole career around avoiding this question \u2013 around continuing to lead a party that\u2019s divided on the most important decision about the country\u2019s future. All because he worked out that, if the subject of the EU was properly debated by the Tories, the party would split and it would be harder for him to become prime minister. So he has conspired in the absurd scenario where successive general elections have been fought on other issues \u2013 where Britain\u2019s future in Europe has not really been addressed by the Tories and instead this bunch of aspiring leaders who can\u2019t agree on this vital issue of leadership have brushed it aside, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll hold a referendum\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019ll let you decide\u201d; \u201cLet us be captain of the ship but we\u2019ll negotiate the most lethal reefs by holding a steering vote among the passengers.\u201d I don\u2019t think a political party has any business existing if it can\u2019t agree a policy on this. Cameron\u2019s policy-avoidance policy was deftly done, mind you. It plays well, rhetorically \u2013 telling people they\u2019ll get to decide, flattering the public\u2019s estimation of its collective wisdom. It\u2019s a rhetoric politicians have increasingly used of late: \u201cWe\u2019re just normal decent people who listen\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019re like an unthreatening mate whose heart\u2019s in the right place\u201d; \u201cBy putting us in power you haven\u2019t committed to anything except fair and sensible niceness for hard-working people who do the right thing.\u201d \u201cMake the public think that all a leader needs to be is normal and inoffensive, and then maybe I\u2019ve got a chance!\u201d is the modern politician\u2019s motto. We\u2019ve stopped looking to MPs to display great intelligence, insight, fortitude or a cool head in a crisis. Now they just get to shrug and say \u201cIt\u2019s tricky, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cVote for me, I think it\u2019s tricky too!\u201d They won\u2019t step up and lead. They won\u2019t say they know. Expertise is dismissed as elitist. It\u2019s worse to be \u201cout of touch\u201d with the price of milk than to misunderstand the consequences of Britain suddenly severing all its trade deals. They\u2019re happy for that decision to be made by random vote after a frenzied few months of both sides trying to make the other seem the more apocalyptic or Hitlerian, everyone suddenly so certain in their hyperbole. Except perhaps David Cameron himself. He\u2019s campaigning for Remain but, according to his long-time political ally Steve Hilton, Cameron\u2019s \u201cinstinct\u201d is for Brexit: \u201cIf he were a member of the public\u2026 I\u2019m certain that he would be for Leave.\u201d So perhaps he can\u2019t decide. Our leader doesn\u2019t know which way to go. I\u2019m not just sorry he\u2019s prime minister \u2013 I\u2019m sorry he gets a vote.",
