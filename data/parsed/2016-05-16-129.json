  "body": "Last year in the Cannes competition, actor-turned-screenwriter Taylor Sheridan delivered us a cracking script for the Tex-Mex drug-lord drama Sicario. Now he repeats the trick with this rangy, violent, and cynical western set in Texas, showing in the Un Certain Regard sidebar. The director is David Mackenzie, the British film-maker whose last film was the much-admired prison drama Starred Up. This continues his winning streak.   Related: Paterson review: Adam Driver's poetic bus driver proves safe pair of hands    Hell or High Water is a heist picture with a satirical edge that reminded me of Brecht\u2019s dictum about robbing a bank being a waste of time compared to owning one; it\u2019s also a gloomy reverie about the hostile Texan plain, comparable to the Coens\u2019 No Country for Old Men, or Blood Simple. There\u2019s also a vague sense memory of the 1960s western Lonely Are the Brave, with Kirk Douglas\u2019s cowboy on the run. Chris Pine and Ben Foster are two brothers, Toby and Tanner: one smart and one stupid, but both equally engaged in the high-risk business of robbing banks \u2013 early in the morning, taking only small-denomination untraceable bills, making it hardly worthwhile for the bank to press charges. Weirdly, they also stick to branches of one particular bank. Stranger still is that Toby could now theoretically be a rich man, having been the sole beneficiary of his late mother\u2019s will, getting the property on which oil has been discovered but which he has actually made over in trust for his children, after his divorce, in financial conditions which at first glance make his new bank-robbing career even more baffling. Tanner is a career criminal whom his mother hated, so the bank heists could be Toby\u2019s way of helping him out. Meanwhile, Marcus \u2013 amusingly played by Jeff Bridges \u2013 is the Texas ranger on the boys\u2019 trail, wearing the regulation plain shirt, white Stetson and sunglasses. His partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) is a Native American in the same getup with whom Marcus does not scruple to make bad-taste jokes about ethnicity. Marcus is on the verge of a retirement that he doesn\u2019t want, and takes a gloomy and almost elegiac pleasure in all the details of this last case; he and Alberto have many a scene in which they enter smalltown restaurants and order coffee with elaborate old-school courtesy from waitresses who are usually charmed, except for one who grumpily insists they have steak because that\u2019s what everyone has, and still angrily remembers some out-of-towner in 1987 who tried to order \u201ctrout\u201d.

And it creates a new, interestingly pointed confrontation between Marcus and Toby. Mackenzie\u2019s direction and Giles Nuttgens\u2019s cinematography create a kind of horizontal vertigo in the dizzying sweep of the landscape and there is a great soundtrack with original music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. It\u2019s an action-thriller with punch; Bridges gives the characterisation ballast and heft and Pine and Foster bring a new, grizzled maturity to their performances.",
