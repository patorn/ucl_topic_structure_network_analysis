  "body": "Before Stormzy became the most talked-about new rapper in the UK, before Adele was shouting him out on stage, before he was the odds-on favourite to record England\u2019s official Euro 2016 song, he was Michael Omari, a kid who lived for badges. Omari would spend school holidays in Thornton Heath library in Croydon, which ran a scheme called Book Trail. \u201cYou read a book, write a detailed review as proof you\u2019ve read it and they give you a badge,\u201d the MC explains. \u201cThat\u2019s where my competitive nature came out. Give me the badges! I would sit in the library all day, not \u2019cos I loved reading, just because I needed those badges.\u201d It\u2019s also how he found his way with words. \u201cI read so many books when I was a kid that I didn\u2019t even know were shaping me up.\u201d   Related: Stormzy review \u2013 accessible flow that shows his range    When Omari was 10, two big moments happened: he became too old for Book Trail and Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Boy In Da Corner was released. Dizzee\u2019s debut was the first grime record to make a dent in the mainstream and remains the London estate-born genre\u2019s masterpiece. Its ectopic beats, menacing bass and frantic take on life on the streets sounded like nothing that had gone before. Even the Guardian\u2019s review of it at the time said it \u201cappears to borrow from nothing.\u201d Boy In Da Corner was also Omari\u2019s musical year zero. Soon after it made the top 40, he became infatuated with the new breed of MCs, with crews like Roll Deep, Ruff Sqwad and N.A.S.T.Y, and their stars: Wiley, Dizzee and Kano. He would swap new tracks with classmates using the Bluetooth functionality on old Nokia phones. Grime at that time worked like social media does today: hundreds of tracks would come out each month, responding and interacting with each other, music videos were filmed on phones, and rappers jostled for prominence during freestyle clashes on radio station Rinse FM, YouTube channel Risky 2 Roadz or on Jammer\u2019s Lord Of The Mics battle series.            Then, as Omari grew up he saw the genre develop. Dizzee became a pop star, but other MCs who tried to follow his grime-lite model isolated their fanbases and eventually lost the attention of the mainstream. At the same time, in the late 2000s, the police were hellbent on shutting down grime events using the notorious risk-assessment form 696. Artists who thought they would make a living from grime started to give up. Omari did a bit of MCing at school, but within a few years he had become a small-time drug dealer. By the time he\u2019d graduated, grime had retreated back to the underground and Michael Omari seemed a long way from becoming Stormzy.    \u201cEvery thing that I was told that I couldn\u2019t do without a label, I\u2019ve done.\u201d       In 2016, it\u2019s a very different scenario. Stormzy towers at 6ft 5in over the City boys surrounding the canal where we\u2019re having an \u201cafter work beer\u201d. \u201cI fucking hate suits. This lot look naff,\u201d he quips, adjusting his box-fresh Adidas T-shirt. Yesterday he interviewed David Beckham in front of a live audience; tonight he\u2019ll be a surprise guest at Wretch 32\u2019s show at Camden\u2019s KOKO. Grime, meanwhile, has rebuilt itself around him. US hip-hop giants such as Kanye and Drake will tell anyone who\u2019ll listen about their love for the genre (the former famously performing at the 2015 BRITs with a crew of UK grime rappers, including Stormzy); Skepta, now the scene\u2019s biggest star, was outselling both Beyonc\u00e9 and Drake in the midweek charts with his new album Konnichiwa. Last summer, the grime movement came full circle when Dizzee Rascal joined Stormzy on stage at Wireless festival. The scene \u2013 and it is a scene \u2013 is in rudest-ever health, thriving on collaboration and supportive MCs, instead of constant beefing.     Live and direct\u2026 Photograph: Chris Lever/REX    But Stormzy\u2019s connection to grime has obscured the many other ways in which he is a unique and outspoken figure in British music. He still hasn\u2019t signed a record deal and is the first unsigned British artist to have a top 10 single (if we\u2019re ignoring YouTuber Alex Day, who once managed the feat with novelty song Forever Yours).    Related: Skepta: Konnichiwa review \u2013 rhymes that are dextrous, sharp and very British    I was at a music industry seminar recently where people were already talking about \u201cthe Stormzy model\u201d. Other artists would likely make this their story, but Stormzy\u2019s desire to score high chart positions and win accolades (he won the best male act at the 2015 Mobos) doesn\u2019t come from some political opposition to the industry machine, just the same place that makes a boy read for badges. \u201cI just feel like there is nothing I cannot do,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery single thing that I was told that I couldn\u2019t do without a label \u2013 get in the charts, get on to the Radio 1 playlist \u2013 I\u2019ve done.\u201d The diverse fanbase he has cultivated over the past two years has gone some way to help. Stormzy\u2019s skill as an MC and strict adherence to grime first-principles (140bpm tracks, freestyles, performing over classic instrumentals from grime forefathers) means he attracts groups of clued-up teenagers who buzz off whatever off-the-cuff tracks he puts online next. But Stormzy\u2019s gigs can also feel like punk shows, complete with suburban boys in moshpits. He has also, whether unwittingly or not, been taken under lad culture\u2019s wing, held up alongside footballer Jamie Vardy, doing nine J\u00e4gerbombs on a night out, wearing vests, and going for a \u201ccheeky Nando\u2019s\u201d (which is lad parlance for, er, going for a Nando\u2019s).     Photograph: Dan Wilton    \u201cYeah I had to learn about lads,\u201d says Stormzy, without skipping a beat, aware that a cool, \u201curban\u201d grime star seems like an unlikely figurehead for banter-loving uni guys. \u201cWhen I was about 19, I made the decision to stop being a thug and a gangster, and I got a prestigious engineering apprenticeship in Birmingham. When I first got there, I remember walking into a room and seeing about 17 white faces.\u201d He says they were all taking the mick out of each other in the most vulgar language imaginable, and laughing about it. He was shocked. \u201cGrowing up in the ends, you don\u2019t do that. You meet someone: you\u2019re very wary of them, you already don\u2019t trust them. We were young kids who are going to war every week, there\u2019s no time to make a joke.\u201d But once he realised that it was okay to break a smile, he reassessed his image. \u201cI realised I don\u2019t want to be a negative bad boy in the corner, not talking to anyone.\u201d  Today, he dips in and out of his laddy side, but insists, \u201cI\u2019ve always been a banter king!\u201d One month he\u2019ll be giving a talk at the Oxford Guild; the next hanging out in Ayia Napa with a guy who\u2019s got \u201cStormzy\u201d tattooed on his bum. But what runs through everything Stormzy does is a self-effacing British sense of humour. It sticks out at a time when pop is having a bit of a po-faced moment. Most artists take themselves very seriously, preferring to only talk about the music.  Stormzy, however, is more of a personality in the Robbie Williams mould: his mum appears in his video rapping his lyrics, and he challenges his fans to Fifa competitions on social media. He says that after living with a group of lads during college, he realised he was \u201cthe banter king\u201d. He\u2019s similar in that sense to his icon Dizzee, who was always happy to balance his weightier stuff with moments of levity. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to put a mask on,\u201d he explains. \u201cFuck that \u2013 sometimes I\u2019m pissed off, sometimes fuck off, sometimes I\u2019m up for banter, sometimes I can playfight for 12 straight hours with the mandem.\u201d     Stormzy accepts his award for Best Grime Act during the Mobo awards 2015. Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty    Here\u2019s a story that shows the many sides of Stormzy. Last year, he dropped his freestyle track Shut Up, which takes as its instrumental the early-00s grime track Functions On The Low. It first emerged as a one-take YouTube video filmed in a park near his former home in Thornton Heath, Stormzy performing on the fly in a red tracksuit flanked by fans. For your average MC, that would have been the end of it. But Stormzy then performed the track during British boxer Anthony Joshua\u2019s ring-walk for his fight against Dillian Whyte and it soared in popularity. It prompted Stormzy to make a bid for the naffest of British music institutions, the Christmas No 1, tweeting \u201cLET\u2019S DO THIS BUN X FACTOR!!!\u201d. Within a week he was dressed as Santa performing a festive version of the track on 1Xtra with the lyrics changed to \u201cReally I shouldn\u2019t be in the rave/ \u2019Cos I don\u2019t drink when I\u2019m riding my sleigh.\u201d It ended up at No 8, one place higher than the X Factor winner\u2019s single.   Related: Party politics: why grime defines the sound of protest in 2016    Despite all this, Stormzy is more than just the jester of the grime scene. As well as being up for a laugh, he\u2019s politically outspoken. After the Brits this year, for example, he called out organisers for the \u201cembarrassing\u201d lack of \u201cgrime and underground\u201d artists nominated. He says he has since had a \u201cproper chat\u201d with the Chairman of the awards to discuss \u201cmaking the list of voters more diverse\u201d so as to prevent \u201cnational outrage over discrimination\u201d but wants to make sure that any changes don\u2019t feel like tokenism - \u201cif Years & Years win the award, that\u2019s cool, they deserve it.\u201d He\u2019s more open to engaging with traditional party politics, too. In the past, grime\u2019s main political stance has been anti-establishment (Skepta\u2019s Shutdown claims that \u201cwe don\u2019t listen to no politician\u201d, in part a reaction to form 696). Stormzy seems happier to take sides. He recently tweeted \u201cBeg no one vote for this Zac Goldsmith bruddah he seems like a proper pussyhole\u201d only to find himself minutes later followed by the official Jeremy Corbyn account. Stormzy grins when I bring this up.            \u201cMy man, Jeremy! Young Jeremy, my guy. I dig what he says. I saw some sick picture of him from back in the day when he was campaigning about anti-apartheid and I thought: yeah, I like your energy. Have you seen that footage of House of Commons? They\u2019re all neeky dons! The way they all laugh and cheer. Is this fucking Game Of Thrones? You lot have got real issues to talk about and deal with. That\u2019s why I like Jeremy: I feel like he gets what the ethnic minorities are going through and the homeless and the working class. That Zac guy, he just seems like a fucking arsehole.\u201d    How is my bredren from the ends ever gonna buy a house? It\u2019s mad out here       Are there any issues he\u2019d raise were he to get the ear of a Corbyn or a Sadiq Khan? \u201cHousing, that\u2019s the first one. Now that I\u2019m at a certain financial situation, I\u2019m able to buy a house. But if I never became this, how the fuck was I gonna buy a house? How is my bredren from the ends ever gonna buy a house? It\u2019s mad out here.\u201d You might say that Stormzy\u2019s sides don\u2019t really fit together: the grime credibility, the range of admirers, the pop star antics, the political conviction. Isn\u2019t there a danger in trying to be all things to all people? \u201cYou know, I feel like I am a package of different flavours. I\u2019m having a beer with you and all these people,\u201d he gestures at the City boys, \u201cbut last night I was on my balcony with my bredren who\u2019s just come out of jail after 13 years, smoking a zoot, talking about what we used to do. I just want to be a human. I don\u2019t give a shit about nothing else. Stormzy and Michael need to be the same person.\u201d         Kanye with, among others, Stormzy, Jammer, Skepta, Shorty, Krept and Konan, Novelist and Fekky.    Arguably, the only thing that\u2019s been holding Stormzy back so far is his musical ambition. To date he\u2019s released blistering verses, mostly over classic grime beats, but he hasn\u2019t, like Dizzee did all those years ago, made something that sounds like nothing else.   Related: Was Kanye patronising or boosting grime with his Brits performance?    He says that\u2019s coming too, on his debut album, out some time this summer. \u201cSo far I committed myself to being a sick guy, a sick performer, but I think that triggered something in me, to be a great musician who makes great music. I think it\u2019s boring when you go to a grime show and you know exactly what you\u2019re going to see: a guy walking up and down and a DJ. I want to think so much bigger than that.\u201d  At the same time, Stormzy recognises the dangers of trying to take the underground overground and suffering the same career stalls as his heroes. \u201cI feel like a lot of our time with our scene, people get very scared and rightfully so, because of what\u2019s happened with artists coming through grime and coming out at the pop end of it. But I just want to make a record that is very musical and very spiritual and from the heart.\u201d The rapper seems remarkably calm for a 22-year-old experiencing a sudden rush of fame, and managing to be funny, political, outspoken, credible all while staying desperately self-assured. Where does all that come from? What makes a guy release without a label? Or read 100 books in a summer just to get a badge?     Photograph: Dan Wilton    \u201cYou know what I feel like I\u2019m full up of so much different crazy shit,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to think I weren\u2019t an interesting person. I\u2019m cool and I\u2019m a good guy but in terms of being interesting\u2026 I felt like I\u2019d be in the ends all my life. I didn\u2019t have a fortunate upbringing, things weren\u2019t lovely \u2013 things were terrible growing up. In terms of street life, financially, behaviourally, shit was the worst. I never had no money. You know the trampy kid in the class? I was that don. I used to think, fuck my childhood. But now I think look, that made me. Fortunate events have led to this, and I\u2019m here now.\u201d We get in a taxi and head out. As we arrive at a club, the rapper Example is waiting outside. Someone\u2019s forgotten to put him on the list and the security guard is having none of it. But when Stormzy arrives, the security guy breaks into a smile and gives him a high five. Stormzy has to point out Example to say he\u2019s allowed in, too. It could have been a moment of tension \u2013 Example being the older and more established of the two \u2013 but both of them just smile. \u201cOh, I can only get in the club with you now, Stormz,\u201d he jokes. It\u2019s all good. It\u2019s all banter. Stormzy plays The Great Escape, Brighton, Saturday 21 May \u2022 This article was amended on 31 May 2016.
