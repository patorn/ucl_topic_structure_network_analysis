There are kimchi burritos, sourdough pizzas and North Carolina barbecues on many street corners \u2013 at least in major cities. But until recently Thai restaurants \u2013 even in hippest Hackney \u2013 have been conservative in their outlook: green and red curries, papaya salads, hot and sour soup. Not forgetting the ubiquitous pad Thai, that MSG-laden heap of peanut dust, noodles and slivers of flavourless meat that is guaranteed to cause you to slump, exhausted, into your bowl. The more interesting regional dishes have remained known mainly to Thais. \u201cPad Thai is not even a very traditional Thai dish,\u201d laughs Ben Chapman, co-founder of Smoking Goat. \u201cIt was basically introduced by the Thai government [in the 40s] to get people to eat more rice noodles.\u201d For the past 18 months, in his tiny bar-restaurant on Denmark Street in Soho, London, Chapman has been doling out a different kind of Thai food. It comes cooked over hot coals and bristling with flavours: nahm yum scallops served on the half-shell; aged beef short rib with massaman and pickles; five spice pork belly. Later this year they will open another, bigger site on the other side of Soho.     Signature dish: smoked goat shoulder with Thai herbs. Photograph: Pal Hansen for the Observer    They\u2019re perhaps the most prominent exponents of a new kind of Thai cooking, much closer to the food that many British tourists will have tasted in the north and northeast of Thailand. \u201cThe first time I ate good Thai food I fell in love,\u201d Chapman says. \u201cIt was food in glorious technicolour \u2013 spicy, umami, sour, sugar \u2013 all at the same time. To me that was astonishing. I wanted to eat it again, but there was nowhere in Britain I could, so I had to learn how to cook it.\u201d While the flavours are heavily influenced by northern Thai cuisine, many of the ingredients are adjusted for the UK. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a short rib in Chiang Mai, for instance. \u201cNone of it is verbatim Thai food,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, our aromatics are very different. Their mint is much smaller and sweeter; here it\u2019s garden mint, which is slightly bitter. Coriander here is slightly soapy, whereas there it\u2019s brighter. In some cases you can work around it. If you are making a nam tok, for instance, a classic northern Thai dish, but you know your mint is weaker, you can use less of it and add sweetness to the stock instead.\u201d     Life after pad Thai: (from left) Mark Dobbie, Tom George and Andy Oliver of Som Saa. Photograph: Pal Hansen for the Observer    In Commercial Street in east London, people are queuing for more than two hours for a table at Som Saa, another restaurant specialising in regional Thai dishes. Among the dishes the diners are waiting to sample are silky panang curries of braised beef cheeks and isaan hot soup that stops just short of blowing your head off. It\u2019s a wider menu than the one at Smoking Goat, taking in southern as well as northern regional Thai cuisine.    You put balls of meat on top of fruit with coriander and chilli. It\u2019s an amazing explosion of flavour and freshness    The permanent site has just opened off the back of a successful stay at Climpson\u2019s Arch in Hackney. Founders Andy Oliver and Tom George funded the site through Crowdcube, which offered hungry diners the chance to get involved. \u201cIf you\u2019re writing a hypothetical business plan for a restaurant, it\u2019s much easier if you have a version of the restaurant that people can see,\u201d says Oliver. \u201cThen if they like it they can invest. It means we don\u2019t just have one big investor who comes down and says he doesn\u2019t like the tables or tells us to use cheaper prawns.\u201d Although they are ostensibly Smoking Goat\u2019s rivals, there is also a sense of esprit de corps. They have all known each other for years. Along with Peckham\u2019s Begging Bowl, run by New Zealander Jane Alty, they are the leading lights of the new wave of regional Thai cooking. It might be an obvious thing to point out, but none of the people involved in this new wave seem to be Thai, though Chapman says he has plenty of Thai customers.     \u2018Food comes cooked over hot coals and bristling with flavours\u2019: (from left) gaeng gari jay, gaeng juet het, sticky rice, pad pak, and nahm dtok pla thort. Photograph: Steve Joyce    All three restaurants are indebted to Pok Pok in New York and the Australian chef David Thompson\u2019s Nahm, which introduced regional Thai food at the higher end of the market in 2001 and is still going strong. Oliver and Alty worked there themselves. \u201cI always liked Asian recipes more than western ones,\u201d Oliver says. \u201cFrom a young age I was cooking Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s recipes, then I travelled round Asia at 19, trying everything. I took a graduate job after uni but packed it in to go to various kitchens \u2013 Moro, Maze, Bocca di Lupo \u2013 before David offered me a job at Nahm. I had no knowledge but a lot of enthusiasm. I never looked back. \u201cThe techniques are totally different. One of the first things you make is ma haw, which is minced pork and minced chicken that has been cooked with coriander, garlic, pepper, fish sauce, palm sugar and all sorts of other seasonings until it\u2019s almost like a caramel. You put balls of this on top of fruit with coriander and chilli. You could spend 1,000 years in a western kitchen and never even consider doing that. Three proteins mixed together is bizarre to a westerner, and the meat is overcooked by about 45 minutes by our standards. But the result is delicious. I like breaking the rules.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2016 to remove a reference to chef Seb Holmes, who no longer works with Ben Chapman.",
