  "body": "If Richard III wasn\u2019t English because of his twelfth\u2013generation Norman ancestry (Letters, 11 May) then neither were Harold Godwinson (half-Danish) nor Edward the Confessor (raised in his mother\u2019s Norman homeland). The last English king was the Confessor\u2019s half-brother, Edmund Ironside, who died in mysterious circumstances one thousand years ago this year, after just seven months on the throne, to be succeeded by the Danish King Canute. Tim LidbetterLondon \u2022 Two further corrections about the last\u00a0English king: first, the Angevins (Plantagenets) were French, not Norman. Second, Edgar (Atheling) was chosen king after Hastings, was not deposed until December 1066, and so should count as the last English king (incidentally, he was still alive in the 1120s). Edgar was son of Edward the Exile and grandson of Edmund Ironside, who succeeded his father Ethelred (the Unready) in 1016. On\u00a0grounds of primogeniture, Edgar\u2019s claim to kingship was better than Edward\u00a0the Confessor\u2019s.Peter McMullenHarrow, Middlesex  \u2022 Congratulations on your extensive coverage of the very exciting county cricket match between Yorkshire and Surrey, which finished on Wednesday evening. Headline news for the record stand between Jonny Bairstow (198) and Joe Root (213), which then led to the nail-biting finale at Headingley in which last season\u2019s county champions beat Surrey and the weather, with only a few overs remaining in the four-day match. Sound familiar? Well it shouldn\u2019t because I had to buy another newspaper to read any of this.Keith FloodRibchester, Lancashire \u2022 David Cameron\u2019s comments to the Queen on corruption (Report, 11 May) are somewhat ironic from the leader of a political party facing police investigations into allegations it breached election spending rules in 2015.Margaret PhelpsPenarth, Vale of Glamorgan  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
