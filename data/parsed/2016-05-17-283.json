  "body": "Mental health is a huge issue for social care professionals around the world. Social workers in any field will work with service users who experience mental health problems: from child protection to work with older people. And social workers themselves may experience mental health difficulties, due to the stress and pressure of doing a tough job. To coincide with Mental Health Awareness Week, the Guardian Social Care Network and US website Social Work Helper are joining forces for a Twitter chat to discuss social work and mental health. We\u2019ll be talking about how being a social worker has affected your mental wellbeing, sharing tips on building resilience, discussing similarities and differences between the UK and the US, and pooling strategies for dealing with stress and anxiety.   Related: Using mindfulness in health and social care: live discussion    Join us on Wednesday 18 May, at 11am EST (4pm BST) on the #globalsocialwork hashtag, to discuss these issues.
