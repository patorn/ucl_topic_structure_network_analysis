  "body": "Anti-Trump demonstrations in New Mexico Protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police outside a Donald Trump rally in Albuquerque, just as a win for Trump in Washington\u2019s primary left him within a handful of delegates of securing the Republican nomination outright. Hillary Clinton, campaigning in California, previewed her new line of attack on Trump, f ocusing on his real estate dealings. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let him bank-rob America,\u201d she said. Bernie Sanders, also in California, called for a recanvass of last week\u2019s Kentucky primary. Today, Trump returns to what has been called \u201criot-happy\u201d Anaheim, where a previous rally in April was nearly derailed by violence. \u201cThis is what Trump wants, it\u2019s giving him his talking points,\u201d said Jimmy Camp, a Republican consultant and member of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement within his party. Meanwhile, Marco Rubio has offered this assessment of the long primary battle: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we lost, it\u2019s that Donald Trump won.\u201d Protests at Donald Trump rally overshadow Washington primary win \u2018Oxy Express\u2019 crackdown fuelled heroin demand It was known as the \u201cOxy Express\u201d \u2013 Florida\u2019s south corridor famous for an unusual concentration of freely prescribing \u201cpill mills\u201d dishing out the synthetic heroin oxycontin. But a crackdown several years ago provides an illustration of what happens when the pharmaceutical industry, clueless administrators and law enforcement make policy: they unleashed a demand for heroin. The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal surveys the wreckage, while Nadja Popovich maps the spread of the drug overdose epidemic.  How cracking down on America\u2019s painkiller capital led to a heroin crisis New Taliban leader appointed The Afghan Taliban has appointed Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada as the new leader of the militant movement days after a US drone strike killed his predecessor, Mullah Mohammad Akhtar Mansoor. The swiftness of the appointment is seen as part of an effort to shore up Taliban unity, which suffered under Mansoor, who was regarded as a divisive figure. Haibatullah is a former Taliban chief justice and heads their religious Ulema council.  Afghan Taliban appoint Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada as new leader Paypal co-founder emerges as Gawker antagonist PayPal co-founder and Californian Trump delegate Peter Thiel has emerged as the likely paymaster behind Hulk Hogan\u2019s successful invasion of privacy case against Gawker Media, according to Forbes. Gawker is appealing against Hogan\u2019s $115m award. Thiel, whose fortune is estimated in excess of $2.7bn, described one of its sub-sites as the \u201cSilicon Valley equivalent of al-Qaida\u201d after Gawker worked to publicly out him. Gawker CEO Nick Denton says he suspected someone in Silicon Valley was backing the lawsuit. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel said to fund Hulk Hogan\u2019s Gawker lawsuit Portland police chief faces calls to quit Larry O\u2019Dea is denying claims that he covered up a hunting accident as a \u201cself-inflicted\u201d shooting. According to officials investigating the case, O\u2019Dea shot a close friend in the back while hunting last month in Harney County, 350 miles east of Portland. O\u2019Dea has been placed on administrative leave with officials saying the city\u2019s police cannot work efficiently \u201cwhen there\u2019s turmoil and confusion surrounding their leader\u201d. Portland police chief in hot water amid claims he lied about shooting his friend ExxonMobil tried to censor climate scientists ExxonMobil moved to squash a well-established congressional lecture series on climate science just nine days after the presidential inauguration of George W Bush, a former oil executive, the Guardian has learned. Exxon\u2019s intervention on the briefings, revealed here for the first time, adds to evidence the oil company was acutely aware of the state of climate science and its implications for government policy and the energy industry \u2013 despite Exxon\u2019s public protestations for decades about the uncertainties of global warming science. ExxonMobil tried to censor climate scientists to Congress during Bush era Cosby to face trial on sex assault charges Bill Cosby must stand trial over an accusation that he intoxicated and sexually assaulted a Temple University employee more than 12 years ago in his Pennsylvania home. The TV star and comedian has vowed to fight charges stemming from a 2004 incident in which he allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand, one of more than 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct. The case involves the only criminal proceedings against Cosby, 78, to emerge from the tidal wave of similar accusations. If convicted, Cosby faces 10 years in prison. Defense attorney Brian McMonagle rejected the accusations. \u201cThe evidence presented today was evidence of nothing. They had 12 years to bring an accuser to confront Mr Cosby. They chose not to.\u201d  Bill Cosby: comedian to stand trial on sexual assault charges in Pennsylvania Liberals, guns, and the NRA\u2019s annual convention The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett went to Louisville, Kentucky, where the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual convention was taking place, and asked gun owners: what do liberals get wrong about guns, and how can we make America a safer place to live?           What do liberals get wrong on guns?    The whitewashing of US media Howard W French describes what three decades working in the predominantly white media has taught him about racism in America. French identifies two enduring themes: a simple failure of integration \u2013 news organisations that have done little to welcome or encourage African Americans \u2013 and a tendency to \u201ctypecast certain topics as \u2018black\u2019\u201d and the rest as \u201cwhite\u201d. The enduring whiteness of the American media Are Cleveland\u2019s playoff hopes crumbling?  The Cavaliers\u2019 frontcourt duo of Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson are facing a crisis at the worst possible moment and look like they\u2019ve \u201clost their essence\u201d, writes Eric Koreen in Toronto. \u201cIn the playoffs, if it happens to the wrong player, it can completely derail a team\u2019s season.\u201d With the series tied at two games apiece, the Cavaliers face a must-win against the Toronto Raptors tonight in Cleveland.  Cavaliers\u2019 big men, thwarted by Biyombo breakout, coming up short Johnny Depp insults Australian minister  Actor Johnny Depp has resumed trading insults with Australian government officials as he continues to mock the apology he made with his wife, Amber Heard, for smuggling their two dogs into Australia. The Australian deputy prime minister and agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, looks like he\u2019s \u201cinbred with a tomato\u201d, Depp said. \u201cI think I\u2019m turning into Johnny Depp\u2019s Hannibal Lecter, aren\u2019t I?\u201d responded Joyce. \u201cI\u2019m inside his head, I\u2019m pulling little strings and pulling little levers. Long after I\u2019ve forgotten about Mr Depp, he\u2019s remembering me.\u201d Johnny Depp says Australian minister looks like he\u2019s \u2018inbred with a tomato\u2019 And another thing ... Two large South American rodents are on the loose in Toronto. Residents, police and zookeepers have been told to be on alert for the 30lb capybaras, who zoo keepers say are \u201cquite shy\u201d. Officials at Toronto\u2019s 399-acre High Park said they would launch an inquiry into how the amphibious rodents got loose after they were returned to safety.
