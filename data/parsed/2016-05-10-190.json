Innovation is a key theme for the world humanitarian summit in Istanbul and it dovetails with the rather dispiriting rationale for this first-of-its-kind meeting: that the aid system is failing and needs to be reformed if it is to cope with protracted, increasingly frequent, manmade and natural crises.

How can we lessen it? | Robert Glasser and Stephen O'Brien    But while innovation is becoming a buzzword, and #ReShapeAid and #TalkInnovation are gaining traction on Twitter, an April report found that little is known about how to flick the innovation switch in organisations bound by red tape.  The report, More Than Just Luck, was produced by the Humanitarian Innovation Fund (Hif) and Alnap, a humanitarian action learning network. Together, they analysed 11 case studies over two years to see which new ideas worked and why. \u201cHumanitarian innovation has never been so popular and yet, when we look at the amount of attention given, there seems to be a lack of clarity,\u201d said Alice Obrecht, one of the co-authors. Innovation has become more mainstream, according to Kim Scriven, manager of the Hif, because there is an ever greater need to do more with less, and a growing role for the private sector in development. But if processes do not speed up, enthusiasm could sour, and the innovation agenda could be hijacked. \u201cIf the mainstream doesn\u2019t act, more radical actors will step in. This will change the nature of the system,\u201d Scriven said. Dr Jemilah Mahmood, under secretary general for partnerships at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said there has been an \u201cexplosion of discussion around innovation\u201d in the past five years. But Mahmood, head of the world humanitarian summit secretariat until she stepped down last year, cautioned that there are still hurdles. One stems from traditional antipathy towards the private sector. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t understand [this resistance], because it is like it is taboo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s slowly changing \u2026 why not have a kind of Dragon\u2019s Den for the humanitarian sector, where you pitch ideas?\u201d A catch-all term, innovation can range from using 3D printers in the field to reaching communities by translating information into local languages. Other innovations touched on in the report include employing technology to track aid in insecure environments, for instance through simulated field visits in central Somalia (pdf), and using disaster microinsurance for small businesses in India. \u201cThat\u2019s really promising,\u201d said Scriven of the last of these ideas, \u201cbecause it will totally change the dynamics of the system. Instead of going to an international agency for a handout, you go to your insurance provider and say, \u2018This contract says you need to pay me in that event\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s what people will use to get back on their feet.\u201d In Istanbul, the UN hopes to launch a global alliance for humanitarian innovation (pdf), which is meant to break down barriers by bringing people from different sectors together to tackle the main humanitarian challenges. Scriven says coordination is fundamental, citing efforts to tackle drainage problems in refugee camps as an example.  \u201cYou get these huge puddles that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes and diseases, but nobody owns that problem. So we brought together people from business, the humanitarian sector and academia. We did research to see who is doing flood management in the UK, who is doing drainage in cities like Amsterdam, who has that real expertise and how can we get them to sit down with humanitarians to look at those specific questions. That\u2019s where there is real scope for the private sector to get involved,\u201d he said.   Related: Fix the aid system or you will fail the poor, experts warn world leaders    Using military knowledge in natural disasters has also long been taboo.  Josiah Kaplan and Evan Easton-Calabria are researching what humanitarians can learn from the military in fields such as ICT, drones and robotics. Kaplan, a research associate with the University of Oxford humanitarian innovation project, acknowledged that aid workers still fear they could be associated with military agendas. \u201cThis isn\u2019t to discount the very serious potential dangers posed by diffusion of military innovations into humanitarian practice \u2026 Nonetheless, we believe innovation is an important area for learning and a valuable space for constructive engagement and dialogue between two communities long known for their strong mutual distrust,\u201d Kaplan said. Sometimes, good ideas get locked in one organisation and are never shared. An institutional fear of failure, among donors and NGOs, can also hinder innovation.  Rebecca Petras, of Translators without Borders, which launched Words of Relief \u2013 described as the first crisis relief translation network \u2013 in west Africa during the Ebola crisis, said funding flexibility was critical to allow her organisation to try ideas and accept failures. The Ebola emergency propelled their core message \u2013 that communication is key \u2013 into the mainstream. \u201cIt was a transformative moment for us \u2026 It wasn\u2019t until the Ebola crisis, and far into the Ebola crisis, that that message was resonating with responders,\u201d she said.  For Mahmood, the Istanbul summit is just the beginning, a view echoed by many observers. \u201cIt\u2019s what happens after the summit that is important. How do we keep the discussion on innovation going? I think we\u2019ve got the ball rolling.\u201d Even those who advocate change warn that innovation is not a panacea and that addressing the aid industry\u2019s systemic problems \u2013 bureaucracy, lack of accountability and inflexible funding \u2013 is still critical. \u201cIt would be naive to think [technology and innovation] will deliver wider change in the humanitarian system,\u201d said Scriven. \u201cIt is imperative [for us] not to gloss over that.\u201d",
