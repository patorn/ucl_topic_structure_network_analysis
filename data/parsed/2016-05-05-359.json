Related: Critical response team to tackle 'ongoing tragedy' of Indigenous suicide    This week more than 370 delegates will gather in Alice Springs for an inaugural conference on how to address the shockingly high rates of suicide among Indigenous Australians.  The conference will hear from a number of high-profile Indigenous campaigners and frontline workers to discuss how to lower the rates, which are far greater than for non-Indigenous Australians.  Nationally suicide rates are 11 deaths for every 100,000 people but that more than doubles for Indigenous people. When the data is broken down further it becomes even more concerning \u2013 Indigenous young people aged 25 to 29 take their own lives at a rate of is 91 in every 100,000 people. It is the leading cause of death for children under 14, and particular areas have seen tragic spikes in deaths. There is no such data when it comes to Indigenous LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex) people. The rates \u2013 believed to be even higher again \u2013 have not been measured. \u201cWe need more data disaggregation in order to ensure tailored support and awareness-raising,\u201d Gerry Georgatos, suicide prevention researcher at the Institute of Social Justice and Human Rights, told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf we do not disaggregate we risk discrimination, we risk making people invisible, elevated risk groups become invisible. When we disaggregate we can then identify what underlays their negative risk factors, and then tailor responses and future direction.\u201d Dameyon Bonson, the founder of Black Rainbow, an advocacy group for LGBTQI Indigenous youth, said people working in the sector were forced to look on comparative data from Canada\u2019s Indigenous people and on intersecting demographics. But actually breaking down suicide statistics to find out just how bad the problem is really just a part of the response. \u201cPolicies are based on statistics, so on one end we need stats to get policy in place because the anecdotal doesn\u2019t make it through,\u201d Bonson told Guardian Australia.    There are three key groups. Them mob, us mob and us other mob \u2026 and we all need self-determination  Dameyon Bonson, Black Rainbow     \u201cBut homelessness and suicide among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is high, and homelessness and suicide among LGBTQI is high. If you\u2019re both, the risk isn\u2019t going to reduce,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a separate high-risk group. We\u2019re at high risk within the Aboriginal community.\u201d Indigenous LGBTQI people were not now part of the decision-making or treatment process, he said, which resulted in a lack of understanding and of safe spaces, and greater discrimination. Health bodies \u2013 both mental and physical, Indigenous and non-Indigenous \u2013 needed to have more inclusive management and employment. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we need separate bodies, we just need to be included in the conversation and the solution process,\u201d said Bonson, who is a Mangarayi and Torres Strait Islander man based in the Kimberley. Last year he was also an Indigenous Human Rights Awards finalist. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander LGBTQI framework, that can just be inserted as an accompaniment to the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health plan.\u201d The current plan has just one mention of LGBTQI people, he said. Bonson\u2019s presentation at the conference will examine the presence of heterocentrism and the exclusion of LGBTQI Indigenous people in communities and decision making processes in the health sector.  \u201cThere are three key groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThem mob [white people], us mob [Indigenous people], and us other mob [Indigenous LGBTQI people] ... and we all need self-determination.\u201d   Related: LGBTI Indigenous people offered a rainbow to follow    Bonson said he wanted to keep the topic light but that distinction was \u201cfundamental\u201d because the lens of each group influenced policy. While there was not a lot of homophobia in the Aboriginal community, \u201cheterosexism plays a significant part in the exclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander LGBTQI people,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of remote communities still have underlying mission values and there are churches in them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conflicting messaging.\u201d He expected his message would be uncomfortable for many in the Indigenous community to hear. \u201cI feel it sometimes in my own community and group of colleagues, that they\u2019re not seeing the heterosexism,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for sister girls so I don\u2019t assume to. Straight black people can\u2019t speak to the LGBTQI people. But I know what inclusion is. It\u2019s a conversation we have to have.\u201d The conference runs from Thursday to Friday in Alice Springs and will hear from speakers including Stan Grant, Prof Tom Calma and Rosalie Kunoth-Monks. \u2022 For information and support in Australia call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 or Black Rainbow on Facebook",
