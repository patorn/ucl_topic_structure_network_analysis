  "body": "On a hot afternoon in Delhi, a group of men sat around a fire chanting Hindu mantras. Idols of Shiva and Hanuman watched on as the group performed a havan puja, a ceremony of worship which they hoped would bring good fortune for the subject of their prayers. Someone had printed out a picture of his face and thumbed vermillion on his forehead, in a sign of reverence.  Alongside the incense, offerings and Hindu gods, he looked somewhat out of place, but the photograph was instantly recognizable: it was Donald Trump.  Vishnu Gupta, leader of the Hindu Sena, the organisation that arranged the ceremony, said that the puja was one of many events the group was organising to gather support for Trump in India, and \u2013 he hoped \u2013 help the controversial Republican candidate win the presidency.  A rally would soon follow, and demonstrations outside the US embassy in Delhi urging Indian-origin Americans to vote for Trump will be on the menu for coming months, Gupta said. \u201cHe\u2019s our hero,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are praying for Trump because he is the only one who can help mankind.\u201d  Gupta\u2019s motives for supporting Trump were simple: \u201cHe\u2019s the only many who can put an end to Islamic terrorism.\u201d  Trump\u2019s hardline stance on Muslim immigration to the US and his rhetoric against Isis and other terror organisations seem to have caught the imagination of the young Hindu fringe leader, who has grown up in a political climate where communal strife between Hindus and the Muslim minority has led to violent clashes on both sides.     A priest applies a tika on the portrait of Donald Trump during a special prayer to ensure his victory, in New Delhi on Wednesday. Photograph: Anindito Mukherjee/Reuters    Shourya Sharma, a 27-year old software developer who is a supporter of the incumbent Hindu nationalist BJP party in India, agreed. \u201cPoliticians in India don\u2019t want to go hard on Muslims because they need the Muslim vote,\u201d he says, claiming that India\u2019s neighbouring Pakistan had fueled terrorist activity by Indian Muslims.  \u201cThe Obama administration emboldened Pakistan to trespass into Indian territory. The threat of Isis is also looming over India. We need support from an ally like the USA,\u201d Sharma said. Trump has made contradictory claims on his stance on India. His promise to revise US immigration policy and take outsourced \u201cAmerican\u201d jobs back from India have raised anxiety in the country, especially among the middle classes, who often aspire to study or work in the US or have relatives in the country. At a rally earlier this week, Trump mocked an Indian call centre worker and mimicked his accent. On the other hand, earlier this year, in an interview with CNN, he said: \u201cBy the way, India is doing great. Nobody talks about it. I have big jobs going up in India.\u201d  Trump\u2019s supporters in India are a small but noisy group. Even in rightwing circles his fans are a minority. When the Guardian contacted regional offices of the far-right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Delhi and Mumbai \u2013 an umbrella Hindu nationalist organisation and the ideological parent of the current BJP government \u2013 questions about the group\u2019s stance on Trump were met with surprise. \u201cWho is that?\u201d one RSS official asked, saying he had no idea about whether the organisation supported Trump before distancing the RSS from the activities of the Hindu Sena. \u201cThey have nothing to do with us,\u201d he said, before putting the phone down quickly. Not all of Trump\u2019s Indian supporters come from a rightwing Hindu background. Abhijit Iyer-Mitra, a foreign policy analyst and magazine columnist, says that he just didn\u2019t want to see Hillary Clinton in power. \u201cI\u2019m a Bernie turned Trump supporter,\u201d he said. \u201c[Clinton] is a walking, talking foreign policy disaster.\u201d Iyer-Mitra argued that Clinton\u2019s fumbles in Libya have left 6,000 Indian families who were working there displaced, and that her approach to the Syrian conflict would lead to more conflict than peace. \u201cHillary has a track record of failure,\u201d he said.  He conceded that Trump is a \u201cmisogynist\u201d and has \u201canti-Islamic tendencies\u201d, but argued that Clinton\u2019s wavering stance on gay rights is a bigger problem for him. \u201cFriends of mine have made her their liberal mascot so casually,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she\u2019s not liberal in any sense of the word. She hedges. She wont go against the political climate.  \u201cTrump and Bernie are both reactions,\u201d he added. \u201cBernie is reaction to too much plutocracy; Trump is reaction to too much political correctness. America needs change. Business as usual is just not going to work.\u201d",
