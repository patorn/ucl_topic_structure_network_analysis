On a Saturday!\u201d I\u2019m exploring the south coast of Mauritius with Laurent Marrier d\u2019Unienville, and we\u2019ve paused at Jacotet Bay. Crowning its perfect (and perfectly empty) arc of sand is \u00celot Sancho, a jagged coral islet topped with monkey apple trees. Two centuries ago, it was a hideout for swashbuckling French corsairs.   Related: A perfect day in Mauritius    \u201cMy kids love it here. Each time we come, we hunt for buried treasure,\u201d says d\u2019Unienville, whose new tour company, Electro-Bike Discovery, shows visitors beautiful, little-known spots such as this. During my stay here, I\u2019ve drunk water from a freshly lopped coconut, wandered through bird-rich filao groves and chatted with kitesurfers who have fallen so profoundly in love with this part of the island that they\u2019ve made it their home. But while luxurious beach holidays have been this lovely Indian Ocean island\u2019s brioche-and-butter for 40 years, far-sighted Mauritians are now beginning to broaden their approach. Their nearish neighbours the Seychelles may be more exclusive, and the Maldives better for diving and snorkelling; but for history, culture, striking inland landscapes and sheer variety, Mauritius trumps them both.  On a visit to the animated little capital, Port Louis, I discover the 21st-century reasoning behind its gradual reinvention.  \u201cAround a third of our visitors are British or French, but in 2015 by far our biggest growth was in tourists from China, Germany and India,\u201d says Marcel No\u00e9, an expert on Mauritian history, culture and tourism. \u201cGermans love adventure and nature as much as beaches, and the Chinese and Indians are drawn here by their cultural connections \u2013 they aren\u2019t really into \u2018could-be-anywhere\u2019 sunshine resorts at all.\u201d Uninhabited until 1638, this is an island of immigrants. It was still bursting with ebony trees, dodos, fruit bats and giant tortoises when the pioneers arrived \u2013 Dutch settlers, who brought in the first of many shipments of slaves from Madagascar to clear swathes of forest for timber and sugar cane. Their French successors, who founded Port Louis, were followed in 1810 by the British, who pledged to honour the island\u2019s customs, laws and traditions, with the result that French is still widely spoken today. But the language that the whole island shares is Creole, a French-based plantation argot with an African-Asian twang. Committed to outlawing slavery, the British created indenture, a system that, according to its critics, was slavery by another name. Between 1834 and 1910, around 462,000 plantation labourers arrived at the Aapravasi Ghat immigration centre in Port Louis, now a world heritage site. Most came by ship from Mumbai, Kolkata or Madras and two thirds ended up staying; a significant majority of today\u2019s Mauritians are of Indian descent. As we tour the impressive Beekrumsing Ramlallah Interpretation Centre, a cultural history museum that opened at the Aapravasi Ghat in 2014, I ask No\u00e9 whether there\u2019s resentment over what happened in the past. \u201cWe try to keep a sense of perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were good masters, as well as bad.\u201d Today, Mauritius manages to remain peaceful without defaulting into homogeneity. In Port Louis, we pass British and French street names, Anglican and Catholic cathedrals, Chinese-run shops, historic mosques, Tamil temples in fondant icing colours and locals swapping greetings in Creole. Down on the waterfront at Yuzu, the capital\u2019s top fine-dining restaurant, executive chef Nizam Peeroo serves the island on a plate. \u201cWhatever our individual origins, we all feel comfortable with flavours from India, China, south-east Asia, Africa and Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cFood brings us together. Separately, each dish has its own identity, but together, they\u2019re all Mauritian, just like we are ourselves.\u201d Emma Gregg stayed on Mauritius at the five-star all-inclusive Heritage Awali Golf & Spa Resort, and at the Heritage Le Telfair Golf & Spa Resort.
