  "body": "What\u2019s going for it? On occasion, friends use me like a bargain-basement Kirsty and Phil. \u201cWhere, Tom,\u201d one began recently, \u201ccan I find a period two-bedroom house no more than an hour\u2019s commute to London Victoria? In the countryside. I want to see fields. \u00a3450k tops. And I don\u2019t want anything modern.\u201d A good question. To which I replied, after a G&T and a cogitate, \u201cWhy, Westerham, West Malling and the West Kent Downs.\u201d Actually Westerham is a bit out of her league, but I threw it in as something to aim towards, because it\u2019s such a lovely old town. Head east of Oxted, west of Maidstone and there\u2019s a very endangered species: perhaps the only accessible patch of the home counties still remotely affordable. No idea why, because it has fabulous bony hills that Chaucer\u2019s pilgrims crossed; pretty if suburban villages supplying the commuter\u2019s every whim; great accessibility, too. And, reader, she moved there. The case against Westerham in full rush hour/school run mode is a sight. Find a home close to train stations and schools to minimise using a car. Well connected? Trains: half hourly to London Victoria from West Malling (50 mins), Borough Green & Wrotham (45 mins) and Otford (35 mins); or from Oxted to London Bridge (hourly, 45 mins) or London Victoria (half hourly, 40 mins). Driving: a few minutes to the M26/M20, and 20 mins to the M25. Schools Primaries: no shortage of \u201cgood\u201d schools, says Ofsted, with St Mary\u2019s C of E (Oxted), Sundridge & Brasted CofE, Chevening C of E, St George\u2019s CofE (Wrotham), Ryarsh, Offham and Leybourne Ss Peter & Paul C of E \u201coutstanding\u201d. Secondaries: Oxted, Trinity (Sevenoaks), Wrotham, The Malling School, Aylesford School and Holmesdale Technology College (Snodland) are all \u201cgood\u201d. Hang out at\u2026 It\u2019s country pub land; try the Plough at Ivy Hatch or the George & Dragon at Chipstead. Where to buy Yum, Westerham. But yikes, the prices. West Malling has an equally pretty, period heart for a perkier price. Root around quiet villages such as Wrotham or Offham. Large detacheds and town houses, \u00a3850,000-\u00a33m. Detacheds, \u00a3400,000-\u00a3850,000. Semis, \u00a3240,000-\u00a3750,000. Terraces and cottages, \u00a3120,000-\u00a3400,000. Flats, \u00a3100,000-\u00a3420,000. Rentals: one-bed flat, \u00a3550-\u00a3850pcm; three-bed house, \u00a31,000-\u00a32,400pcm.

Mind you, a four-bed period terrace in Wateringbury for \u00a3275,000? With Hicks. From the streets  Kelly Innes \u201cEvery May bank holiday there\u2019s a tradition of beating the bounds \u2013 walking the perimeter of Westerham parish. Jane Hunter \u201cWesterham has a great cafe culture and it\u2019s friendly. Chartwell, Winston Churchill\u2019s former home and now a National Trust property, is a mile away and a great place to visit.\u201d \u2022 Live in Westerham, West Malling and the West Kent Downs?
