  "body": "The award-winning children\u2019s author Philip Ardagh has suggested that Simon Cowell visit a library for expert literary advice, after the Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge announced that he was planning to write his own children\u2019s book because most are \u201cquite boring\u201d. Cowell told a US television show that he had \u201cread a lot of these children\u2019s books\u201d to his two-year-old son, \u201cand they\u2019re quite boring. I think I could do it better.\u201d His own title, he said, would \u201cbe about animals\u201d, and would include a character based on himself, \u201cobviously a sort of hero figure\u201d. His comments sent the world of children\u2019s books into a social media spin \u2013 \u201cSimon Cowell says that all children\u2019s books are \u2018boring\u2019, but I suspect he was probably just having trouble with some of the longer words\u201d, tweeted comedian and children\u2019s author Danny Wallace, while bestselling writer Matt Haig said Cowell was \u201ctrolling the whole of children\u2019s literature\u201d. Ardagh took the time to write an open letter to Cowell, providing the celebrity with a few tips. \u201cNo doubt you\u2019ve already received a lot of flak from my fellow children\u2019s authors regarding your announcement that you might give writing children\u2019s books a go. It comes with the territory,\u201d wrote Ardagh. It \u201ccould well be true\u201d, he said, that Cowell has read a lot of \u201cquite boring\u201d books, because \u201cas with pop music and TV shows, there\u2019s good and bad stuff out there\u201d. Ardagh, winner of the Roald Dahl funny prize, went on to suggest that a good, professional librarian \u201ccan point you in the direction of some amazing books for your son, whatever his age and interests\u201d.   Related: The children's books Simon Cowell needs to read    Ardagh also took the opportunity to speak out for public libraries, which he told Cowell had been closing \u201cat an alarming rate in the UK\u201d, with \u201cmany of those remaining open [without] professional staff\u201d. More than 300 libraries have closed over the last six years, with almost 8,000 jobs lost as a result. \u201cSo, whether you choose to get into children\u2019s publishing or not, it would be wonderful if you\u2019d show your support for libraries and librarians with a kind word or two,\u201d said Ardagh. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you talk publicly about reading to your son. May you share many brilliant books together, whether by you or by other people.\u201d \u201cI am very pleased that Simon Cowell is writing a children\u2019s book,\u201d Michael Rosen, former children\u2019s laureate and author of We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt, wrote on the blog of publisher Scholastic. \u201cThe more often famous and popular people write books, the more popular children\u2019s books become. There are thousands of wonderful kids\u2019 book out there to read. Welcome to the party, Simon.\u201d",
