There was a \u201chuge silent majority\u201d of gun owners, she said, who supported moderate gun control measures, and that many National Rifle Association members did not agree with the group\u2019s political positions.  Just two weeks later, Couric and director Stephanie Soechtig are under pressure over what many observers are calling deceptive editing of a key moment in their film. The leader of a gun rights group featured in the documentary says the film edited out gun owners\u2019 responses to one of Couric\u2019s questions \u2013 and instead has them sitting in silence, looking \u201cstupid\u201d. In the press, criticism has been fierce. National Public Radio\u2019s David Folkenflik said the \u201cmanipulation \u2013 and that\u2019s what it was \u2013 would not pass muster at NPR under its principles for fairness\u201d. At the Washington Post, Erik Wemple called Soechtig\u2019s initial response to the criticism \u201cweaselly\u201d and wrote: \u201cAn apology, retraction, re-editing, whatever it is that film-makers do to make amends \u2013 all of it needs to happen here.\u201d On Twitter, gun rights advocates dubbed the incident #Gungate, and the NRA is asking members to sign a petition demanding Couric be fired from her job as a global news anchor at Yahoo. Gun control groups, which are positively featured in the film and have worked to promote it, have used the same #gungate hashtag to defend it.  \u201cEPIX stands behind Katie Couric, director Stephanie Soechtig, and their creative and editorial judgment,\u201d the company distributing the film said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe encourage people to watch the film and decide for themselves.\u201d  Yahoo did not respond to a request for comment.  In the film, in a moment at least one reviewer highlighted as particularly telling, Couric asks a group of gun rights advocates from Virginia: \u201cIf there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?\u201d  The question is followed by several seconds of silence and footage of members of Virginia Citizens Defense League looking uncertain. It is a moment that seems to back up the central argument of the film: that there are some \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun control policies that almost all Americans support \u2013 and that even passionate gun rights activists can\u2019t find a way to argue against.  It is also a moment that the president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League says never happened. Philip Van Cleave says he and another group members made audio recordings of the interview with Couric. In his recording, there is no silence after Couric\u2019s question. Instead, a member responds immediately: \u201cOne, if you\u2019re not in jail, you should still have your basic rights \u2026 if you\u2019re a felon and you\u2019ve done your time, you should have your rights.\u201d  Another says: \u201cThe fact is, we do have statutes both at the federal and state level that prohibit classes of people from being in possession of firearms \u2026 These things are already illegal. What we are really asking about is a question of prior restraint.\u201d         The key moment in Under the Gun.    Van Cleave said he did not tell Couric he was making an audio recording, but recalled another member of the group, who was also recording the session, mentioning it to her \u201cin passing\u201d.  It\u2019s \u201cbecome a habit of mine\u201d to record interviews, Van Cleave said.   \u201cWhenever I do an interview when I don\u2019t know the person, I record them as an insurance policy\u201d against being misquoted.  The discrepancy between the audio recording and the way the film portrayed the question was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon and Ammoland, he said.  In response to questions about the discrepancy, Soechtig said in a statement to the Washington Post: \u201cMy intention was to provide a pause for the viewer to have a moment to consider this important question before presenting the facts on Americans\u2019 opinions on background checks. I never intended to make anyone look bad and I apologize if anyone felt that way.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve scarcely seen a thinner, more weaselly excuse,\u201d wrote the Post\u2019s Wemple.  Van Cleave called the statement a \u201cnon-apology\u201d and that Soechtig\u2019s \u201cown family probably wouldn\u2019t have accepted from her without an argument\u201d. \u201cWhat they wanted the people to consider wasn\u2019t the question that was asked about background checks \u2013 they wanted eight seconds for people to consider how stupid [the gun owners] were,\u201d Van Cleave said.  Soechtig did not respond to a request for comment. In an interview earlier this month, she told the Guardian making the film had convinced her gun owners had been \u201cduped\u201d by the NRA.            What do liberals get wrong about guns?     Related: Democrats made assault weapons more popular, says gun historian    Couric released a brief statement in support of her director and the film. A spokeswoman for the film told NPR Couric \u201cquestioned the pause, but the director made the decision to use it to lead into the discussion of the hole in background checks\u201d. Van Cleave countered that Couric \u201chas been a leader in this business for a very long time\u201d, so \u201cshe of all people should have the ethics of journalism memorized.\u201d  Todd Gitlin, a professor and media ethics specialist at Columbia University\u2019s Journalism School, said both the edit and the initial apology were not appropriate.  \u201cThe editing was indeed manipulative \u2013 and I go further: malpractice,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail.  \u201cAn apology for making somebody feel bad is not a serious apology. It doesn\u2019t reckon with right and wrong, it only says, \u2018I\u2019m sorry somebody felt bad.\u2019 A misrepresentation is a misrepresentation regardless of whether somebody feels bad, good, or appreciative.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat constitutes a fireable offense is another question, on which I do not have an opinion.\u201d Van Cleave said Under the Gun was \u201ca gun control movie\u201d, not a balanced look at the issue \u2013 a view shared by many reviewers. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for many, many years now,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I\u2019m not going to get equal time. I don\u2019t care, as long as our words are left alone.\u201d",
