  "body": "Folding The work featured in the illustration above is a frottage drawing on paper, and is a single element of a series of six pencil rubbings. Each element traces a different set of folds in the paper, creating individual, geometrically abstract patterns. Maths In all six drawings, diamonds, squares and triangles cut over each other. There\u2019s a sense of both endless possibility \u2013 so a case of mathematic abstraction as well as artistic \u2013 and that Maurer has been very careful about her decisions on where to fold. Human presence The fact that we are reminded of Maurer\u2019s presence is not a coincidence. There is a performative element to all her work, and she constantly reminds us that the art we see is the product of a human body, and human decision-making. Politics It is perhaps worth noting that this ode to personal autonomy and subjective determination was made in communist Hungary. It is political art, but of a type that is more than subtle enough to fly under the radar of state repression. Fame \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a star or suchlike,\u201d Maurer has said. Increasingly, however, she\u2019s looking like one. Now 78, and long respected at home, her work is striking a chord with a wider audience. White Cube Mason\u2019s Yard, SW1, Tue to 9 July",
