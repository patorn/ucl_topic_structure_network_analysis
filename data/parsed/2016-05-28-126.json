  "body": "There are certain things western readers expect from a Colombian novelist, and Juan Gabriel V\u00e1squez (pictured) has made quite a point of avoiding them. His\u00a0prose is minimal, sharp, clean; his novels are rooted in historical fact and eschew magical realist flights of fancy. He has chosen not to play into the lurid drugs-and-violence vision of his homeland so beloved of Hollywood screenwriters, setting his stories in Belgium (The All\u00a0Saints\u2019 Day Lovers) and among Colombian Jews and Nazis during the second world war (The Informers). It is\u00a0no surprise, though, that his biggest success, The Sound of Things Falling, which won the Impac award in 2014, was a sideways look at the drugs trade. V\u00e1squez\u2019s Colombia is in some ways culturally closer to Europe than it is to Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s\u00a0Macondo and the Caribbean coast. He was brought up in Bogot\u00e1, a rainy mountain-top city where traditional dress is a wool suit and overcoat, and after studying at the Sorbonne lived for most of his adult life in Europe; he has always said that his literary influences are European and American. Reputations is his first novel since moving back to Bogot\u00e1, and takes place entirely among the educated middle class. This is a world of nice houses in the mountains, of art galleries and cocktail parties. We feel the shadow of many years of political and social tumult only obliquely, in glancing references to \u201cthe years of terrorism\u201d, in the characters\u2019 fear of violence. The main character, political cartoonist Javier Mallarino, moved out of the city centre in the 1980s following threats to his life \u2013 a decision that, we are told, \u201chad been national news\u201d. He\u00a0spends his time now at a safe and slightly contemptuous distance from the lottery-ticket sellers and bootblacks down town. The first section of the book is full of\u00a0promise. Mallarino is on his way to be honoured for his lifetime\u2019s work at the prestigious Teatro Col\u00f3n. Having been the scourge of a generation of politicians, having remained outspoken throughout the years of violence, suffering threats from every side, he is now sufficiently part of the establishment to have his self-caricature put on a stamp. The life of a political cartoonist who has lived through a period of terror has obvious echoes of\u00a0current events, and V\u00e1squez\u2019s prose, translated by Anne McLean, is\u00a0spare and effective, with a pleasing precision (a moustache is \u201cwhite and grey, like pigeon shit\u201d). Even if I found it difficult to imagine a cartoonist today being so famous that everybody in the street \u201cwould react at the mention of his name\u201d, there is plenty of dramatic potential in the idea\u00a0of a rebel being adopated by the establishment at the end of his career. How will the man who identifies himself with Ricardo Rend\u00f3n, a Colombian cartoonist of the 1930s known as \u201cpublic enemy number one\u201d, react to his appropriation by a\u00a0corrupt and cynical system? However, as the story develops some bewildering flaws spoil things. Mallarino\u2019s inevitable crisis is brought on not by the lifetime achievement celebration itself, not by anxiety about his proximity to the establishment he has been hell bent on criticising, but by the appearance of a young woman at the event. Samanta Leal poses as a journalist in order to access his house for an interview, but then reveals that she has been there before. This triggers a confusing plot involving a senator who may \u2013 or may not \u2013 have sexually attacked her when she was a child, and Mallarino embarking on an improbable and morally questionable attempt to introduce her to the former wife of her attacker, so she can find out the truth. As a result, what I was hoping would be a meditation on the pressures on free speech during a civil war, on the human impact of terrorism, on the tension between the desire for recognition and artistic credibility, gets bogged down in misguided sexual dynamics. The attack seems like a cynical plot device; it exists simply to create a crisis for Mallarino, with the victim never more than a side issue. Worse still, she returns as a young woman who is conveniently both attractive (her mouth is \u201ca freshly washed strawberry\u201d) and disturbed enough to be sexually uninhibited. From a strong writer with a compelling vision, it is a disappointing waste. \u2022 To order Reputations for \u00a311.99 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
