  "body": "Lizzie on Angela What were you hoping for?Great conversation and a few smiles. First impressions?Very confident. What did you talk about?How many eligible lesbians there are for each of us in the world, how to survive a zombie apocalypse, and her newest skill, headstands. Any awkward moments?Only when I walked out with a nearly full bottle of wine. Good table manners?Perfect \u2013 she even let me try some of her pudding. Best thing about Angela?How she politely tolerated my long, meandering stories of nonsense. Would you introduce her to your friends? Yes. Describe her in three wordsIntense, open, focused. What do you think she made of you?A bit of an oxymoron: a sensible risk-taker. Did you go on somewhere?No, but we were in the restaurant for three hours. And... did you kiss?A little hug at the station. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I wouldn\u2019t have told so many long, meandering stories of nonsense. Marks out of 10?7.5. Would you meet again?It would be good to show her how my headstand is coming along. Angela on Lizzie What were you hoping for?To spice up my Netflix Fridays. First impressions?Not like anyone I\u2019d usually date. What did you talk about?How she takes professional risks, but not personal ones, how we push men out of the way to use weights at the gym. Any awkward moments?The crowd outside for Bryan Ferry. I had no idea who he was. Good table manners?You bet. Best thing about Lizzie?She took out the bottle of wine for me (so thoughtful!). Would you introduce her to your friends? Sure. Describe her in three wordsEasygoing, positive, ambitious. What do you think she made of you?Scatty, but easy to talk to. Did you go on somewhere?No, she had to get home.   Related: Blind date: \u2018He kept telling me he\u2019d won at dessert\u2019    And... did you kiss?Nope. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Add some activity, like bowling. Marks out of 10?9. Would you meet again?Yes. I\u2019m not sure if there was a romantic spark, but I like her energy. \u2022 Angela and Lizzie ate at the Carnaby Brasserie in the Courthouse hotel, London W1. Fancy a blind date?
