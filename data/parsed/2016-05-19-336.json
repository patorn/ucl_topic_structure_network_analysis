  "body": "Increased fines and a new offence for franchisors who fail to stop underpayments by franchisees are key planks of a new Coalition policy to stop wage theft. The policy, released on Thursday, proposes a higher penalty category for \u201cserious contraventions\u201d when an employer \u201cdeliberately and systematically\u201d rips off workers, including by forcing them to pay back wages, as 7-Eleven franchises have done.  Penalties for this category will be 10 times higher than the current maximum penalty, meaning individuals could be fined $108,000 and companies $540,000. The Coalition has promised $20m of extra funding to the Fair Work Ombudsman, which polices underpayment, although the extra money comes after resources for the ombudsman were cut by $17m in the past year.

So who's turning a blind eye? | Joo-Cheong Tham    The ombudsman will also get new powers to compel employers to answer questions and produce documents, like other agencies including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the tax office.  The policy proposes a new offence for franchisors and parent companies who \u201cfail to deal with exploitation by their franchisees\u201d. Franchisors and parent companies will be liable where they \u201cshould reasonably have been aware of breaches and could reasonably have taken action to prevent them from occurring\u201d. Although franchisors may escape liability if they educate franchisees about obligations and \u201chave assurance processes in place\u201d. The Greens industrial relations spokesman, Adam Bandt, said: \u201cThe proposed changes don\u2019t go far enough in making head office responsible for actions of franchisees. \u201cIf head office is able to say, \u2018We\u2019ve given them an education session,\u2019 then wipe their hands of it, the exploitation will continue.\u201d The Coalition has promised new penalty provisions for obstructing Fair Work Ombudsman investigators or providing false or misleading information. The policy explicitly cites the 7-Eleven scandal as the impetus to protect vulnerable workers. It said 7-Eleven demonstrated both \u201csystemic underpayment of workers\u201d and coercion to make workers pay back a portion of their wage to their employers. Speaking on Radio National on Thursday, the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said: \u201cThe 7-Eleven business model basically dictated the only way you could make a profit was if you undercut wages. Now if a franchisor does this knowingly, why is it that they are not held liable?\u201d Cash said the policy was comprehensive and \u201clooks at exploitation, if it does occur, and ensures the fines are a deterrent to this kind of behaviour\u201d. Labor\u2019s policy to combat worker exploitation also promises higher penalties and more resources to the Fair Work Ombudsman. Both Labor and the Greens criticised the government for announcing their proposed changes during caretaker mode rather than legislating them before parliament was dissolved. An Adelaide law school labour law expert, Andrew Stewart, said it was \u201csignificant\u201d that parent companies and franchisors could be held liable for subsidiaries and franchisees, but asked why the policy didn\u2019t apply to a company who used a subcontractor or a labour hire agency that underpaid workers.  \u201cContracts can be written to provide greater or lesser control. If underpayment is not just an issue in franchises ... why not go further?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that in effect, there\u2019s a bit of a bidding war between the Coalition and Labor as to who can be tougher on worker exploitation,\u201d he said. Stewart said Labor\u2019s policy targeted a wider variety of exploitative practices, including sham contracting and phoenixing (the intentional transfer of assets from an indebted company to a new company to avoid paying creditors), but the Coalition\u2019s was arguably tougher on franchisors such as 7-Eleven. A Sydney University business school academic, Stephen Clibborn, who conducted a survey which found 60% of international students in Sydney earn less than the national minimum wage, told Guardian Australia it takes \u201ca couple of steps in the right direction\u201d by increasing penalties and funding to the ombudsman. \u201cIncreasing penalties is one part of the equation, but anyone underpaying workers is clearly making a calculation of the deterrent and chance of getting caught \u2013 that\u2019s why we need a serious increase in [Fair Work Ombudsman] funding,\u201d he said. The National Union of Workers national secretary, Tim Kennedy, told Guardian Australia there was \u201cnot much in the policy because it doesn\u2019t even give workers are pathway to enforce these rights\u201d.   Related: 7-Eleven chain allegedly pays some staff in Australian stores just $10 per hour    He said even the increased penalties were a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d compared with the amount of money 7-Eleven earned due to widespread underpayment. The NUW is also concerned the policy holds franchisors liable for franchisees, but not companies who use labour hire and subcontractors who then underpay their workers. \u201cLabour hire employees and franchisee workers don\u2019t have the same rights as directly employed workers to collectively bargain,\u201d he said.  \u201cOur view is the policy does nothing to change the current dynamic in the labour market where you have wholesale exploitation of workers without the same rights as directly-employed workers, because the risk has been moved down the supply chain onto them as individuals.\u201d The policy comes after 7-Eleven sacked the independent panel, led by Alan Fels, investigating underpayments and took the wage recovery process in-house. Members of the panel blasted 7-Eleven\u2019s decision, saying the franchisor was spooked by the possibility it may have to pay more than $100m to in back wages. Under the policy the Fair Work Ombudsman will have a new migrant workers taskforce which will receive expert advice from Fels. Clibborn questioned how this differed to the current migrant worker team in the ombudsman. Cash said 7-Eleven was negotiating a proactive compliance deed with the ombudsman which would give it oversight over wage payments and recovery of previous underpayments.",
