  "body": "The video footage shot on a mobile phone last Wednesday is unsteady but clear enough. It shows a man, drenched in liquid, standing alone in a clearing, pleading. No one, it seems, wants to stand near him. In the background, the white shirts and blue caps of staff from the UN high commissioner for refugees are apparent. \u201cThis is how tired we are,\u201d the man yells desperately. \u201cThis action will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it any more.\u201d The man makes a swift, small movement with his right arm, and suddenly, his body is alight. The video picks up his screams as he flails and runs, then falls and is covered with a blanket by onlookers. After he lies still but conscious, while others around cry and yell for an ambulance. He makes no noise. The man in the video, 23-year-old Iranian Omid Masoumali, set himself on fire in protest at his ongoing detention on Nauru, one of two offshore detention centres run by the Australian government as a deterrent for asylum seekers arriving by boat. Masoumali had been recognised as a refugee: he was judged to have a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d in his homeland and required protection. He had been on Nauru for three years. Further video footage \u2013 the Guardian has chosen not to publish any of the clips \u2013 shows Masoumali\u2019s final hours of consciousness.     Omid Masoumali, the 23-year-old Iranian had been recognised as a refugee. Photograph: Supplied    One clip shows him almost naked at Nauru hospital, pacing up and down and screaming \u2013 with peeling skin and severe burns apparent to his arms, legs, chest, and back \u2013 while distressed friends plead for him to be given assistance. Another shows doctors and nurses struggling to administer painkillers, as Masoumali, still standing, continues to scream. People watching nearby are vomiting. He was later transferred to Australia but died on Friday. Masoumali\u2019s case is not an isolated incident.

Reports from Nauru suggest she has severe burns to 70% of her body, with her upper body and face most badly affected. One person reported that \u201call of her clothes were burned off\u201d. On Monday night, police surrounded Nauru\u2019s only hospital, where Yasin was initially treated, and physically restrained her friends from seeing her. Yasin, who is between 19 and 21 years old, was returned to Nauru less than a week ago, having been brought to Australia last November after being seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. Fellow detainees at the Brisbane immigration transit accommodation say she screamed as she was forcibly dragged out by guards.     Hodan Yasin set herself alight on Monday evening. Photograph: Supplied    Yasin has now been flown back to Australia by air ambulance and remains in a critical condition. In the days between Masoumali and Yasin\u2019s public acts of self-harm, at least six suicide attempts have been reported on Nauru, ranging from people swallowing razor blades, ingesting washing powder or attempting to hang themselves using bed sheets. Sources on the island say self-harm and suicide attempts happen daily. Guards are issued with special hooked knives to cut down people who are attempting to hang themselves. On Nauru, some who survive a suicide attempt are charged, convicted, jailed and fined for the crime of attempting to take their own life. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, blamed the rise in the number of suicide attempts on Australian refugee advocates encouraging people to harm themselves. \u201cI have previously expressed my frustration and anger at advocates and others who are in contact with those in regional processing centres and who are encouraging some of these people to behave in a certain way, believing that that pressure exerted on the Australian government will see a change in our policy,\u201d Dutton said. Refugee advocates say the allegations are offensive and desperate. They say they spend hours counselling people not to hurt themselves.   Related: Asylum and climate change are back in the news \u2013 and the response has been pathetic | Lenore Taylor    The reports of self-harm and widespread protests, often accompanied by videos now in broad circulation, have revealed the brutal reality of Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime. The massive, secure camps are sealed off from external scrutiny. The entire nation of Nauru is essentially off-limits to foreign journalists. But information has leaked out, detailing a litany of abuses, sexual assaults and deprivations in Australia\u2019s island camps. The graphic and public nature of Masoumali and Yasin\u2019s self-immolations has led to questions being asked of a policy that had enjoyed significant, if far from total, support, and was trumpeted by the government as a triumph. Masoumali\u2019s widow, also a refugee, has criticised the delay in getting him care on Nauru, and the quality of care he did receive. She says it was hours before he was given painkillers. It was more than 22 hours before he was taken to a Brisbane hospital.     Protesters hold a vigil in Sydney following the death of Omid Masoumali. Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images    Masoumali\u2019s widow, who does not want her name published, told the Guardian that her husband was not given a sheet or a place to lie down, and that the hospital \u201cdidn\u2019t even have a clean syringe\u201d. She said: \u201cStaff in Nauru hospital couldn\u2019t help Omid in any way because they were unequipped.\u201d She was flown to Australia alongside her husband and in the days following his death she said she was being kept in a Brisbane hotel by immigration authorities, denied access to a lawyer and sedated. The Nauru government has said Masoumali received \u201cthe highest level of care\u201d.   Map   Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime \u2013 long condemned by critics for its unbending punitive action but lauded by supporters as the key factor in \u201cstopping the boats\u201d \u2013 is facing unprecedented pressure. The Nauru camp holds about 500 people, with a further 700 refugees \u201cresettled\u201d on the tiny Pacific Island. Because of the imposition of Australia\u2019s policy, refugees and asylum seekers make up more than 10% of Nauru\u2019s 10,000-strong population, and Nauru is now, per capita, accepts the third highest proportion of refugees in the world. But Nauru has consistently refused to consider permanent resettlement for any refugees.

Fewer than 20 men have been resettled in PNG, mainly in the city of Lae, where they report having been assaulted, robbed, left homeless, arrested, or forced to sell what little they own to survive. At least six have made their own way back to Manus \u2013 some tried to break back into detention \u2013 either seeking food and shelter or because they did not feel safe living outside in PNG. The PNG supreme court ruled last week that the detention of the men on Manus is unconstitutional and illegal and ordered the closure of the detention centre. The PNG government has said it would shut the centre, and has asked the Australian government to find alternative arrangements for the men detained there. But the Australian government has said the men are the responsibility of PNG.

As the Australian election campaign gets under way this week, the issue of asylum seekers will once again be prominent, as it was in the elections of 2001, 2007, and 2013. \u201cStop the boats\u201d was the key campaign slogan for the Liberal leader, Tony Abbott, in 2013, when he displaced a Labor government he said had \u201clost control of Australia\u2019s borders\u201d. The Liberal-National coalition policy in government \u2013 operation sovereign borders \u2013 involved intercepting boats and turning them back to Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Combined with offshore processing and a resolute policy that no asylum seeker arriving by boat would ever be resettled in Australia (asylum seekers who arrive by plane are not subject to detention), the policy has seen a massive reduction in the number arriving by sea. The prime minister who replaced Abbott \u2013 Malcolm Turnbull, who was elevated in a party coup in September \u2013 has maintained the policies, telling critics \u201cwe cannot be misty-eyed about this, we have to be very clear and determined in our national purpose\u201d. But the reports of abuse, which have included one asylum seeker murdered by guards, another who died of a treatable infection, and widespread reports of rape, sexual abuse of children, and violence against detainees \u2013 have plagued Australia\u2019s detention centres. The UN has repeatedly condemned Australia\u2019s detention regime as unlawful and damaging. This week, the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees said there was \u201cno doubt that the current policy of offshore processing and prolonged detention is immensely harmful\u201d and called for Australia to move people to more \u201chumane conditions\u201d.   Related: Refugee on Nauru convicted of attempted suicide to 'deter' others    \u201cThe consensus among medical experts is that conditions of detention and offshore processing do immense damage to physical and mental health.\u201d The opposition Labor party, which previously supported all of the coalition policies on asylum, has this week sought to make a political point of difference, saying that while it remained in favour of offshore detention, it did not support the \u201cindefinite detention\u201d of the current regime and committed itself to resettling people in third countries. It did not name any potential countries. In a further complication on Tuesday, a fishing boat reportedly carrying 12 asylum seekers from Sri Lanka landed on Australia\u2019s remote Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean. It was the first asylum seeker boat to reach Australian waters in six months.",
