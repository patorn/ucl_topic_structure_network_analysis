  "body": "Rebecca Adlington, the four-times Olympic medallist, says Britain\u2019s swimmers will not be put off by the Zika virus as they prepare for the Rio Olympics, despite growing concern over its potential impact. More than 100 experts wrote to the World Health Organisation on Friday to call for the Rio Games to be postponed or moved in light of the threat from the disease, a request that was rejected. Adlington, who shot to fame by winning two gold medals in Beijing and then two bronzes four years later in London, said there was little chance of Britain\u2019s 26 swimmers reconsidering their decision to travel.   Related: WHO rejects call to move Rio Olympics because of Zika virus    \u201cAs far as I know, they\u2019ve been told the situation and it\u2019s all under control. All the athletes have decided to go. They are all going to monitor the situation and do everything the doctors say,\u201d she said. Adlington will travel to Rio as a BBC pundit but, asked about the virus \u2013 which has been linked to birth defects \u2013 said she would not have considered missing the Games were she still competing. \u201cIt\u2019s the Olympic Games. It\u2019s the highest thing you can achieve. We\u2019ve got 26 athletes on the swimming team and there\u2019s not one of them that has put their hand up and said they don\u2019t want to go,\u201d said Adlington. The former swimmer, who retired in 2013 at the age of 23, expects Britain\u2019s swimmers to deliver between four and six medals in Rio after what was widely considered a disappointing Games in London. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because in Beijing we got three medals and in London we got three medals and everyone says we did awful in London. We still got the same number; they just changed colour. It\u2019s a bit of a funny one that everyone classes London as such a disappointment,\u201d she said. \u201cI personally don\u2019t see it that way but I\u2019d like to think going into Rio that we could get more than three medals. We\u2019ve not been able to really say that before. I\u2019d like to think we can get four to six medals if everyone is swimming on form and everything goes to plan.\u201d She said encouraging performances at the European Championships by Fran Halsall, Siobhan-Marie O\u2019Connor and Chloe Tutton showed that the female swimmers could contribute alongside the men. Adlington said her first Games as a noncompetitor would be \u201cheaven\u201d and she was \u201cvery much looking forward to my first Olympics where I\u2019m not nervous and not terrified\u201d. She also called for more clarity on the issue of doping, in light of recent suggestions that Russian swimming could be as afflicted as track and field. Swimming\u2019s world governing body, Fina, recently said the twice suspended Yuliya Efimova might be able to compete after all having previously indicated she could be banned for life over meldonium use. \u201cAs an athlete you want a clear-cut decision about individual athletes. The situation is what it is and you can\u2019t let that affect your training as an athlete,\u201d she said. But she called on the World Anti-Doping Agency and federations to do more to tackle the problem. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of those where something bigger needs to happen from Wada. How can we ever catch up with it? It always feels like we\u2019re chasing our tails a bit. Something more drastic from a higher power needs to happen.\u201d Adlington, who was still a teenager when she became the first Briton to win multiple swimming Olympic gold medals for a century in Beijing, said she had been advising Adam Peaty on how to cope with the pressure \u2013 but backed him to do so effortlessly. \u201cHe is so solid. He\u2019s so level-headed, so grounded. He\u2019s the whole package. Adam does still come to me and asks me a few things. I always give him my advice whereever possible,\u201d she said.",
