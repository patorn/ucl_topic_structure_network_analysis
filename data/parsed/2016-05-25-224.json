  "body": "The watery greys of Neil Murray\u2019s set are a stark contrast to the lurid colour of his costumes \u2013 which is only fitting for the larger-than-life characters in Liz Lochhead\u2019s tragicomedy about the scandalous life of Moli\u00e8re. Led by Jimmy Chisholm as the 17th-century playwright and Siobhan Redmond as his on-off lover Madeleine B\u00e9jart \u2013 two seasoned manipulators, the low-rent equivalent of Valmont and Merteuil in Les Liaisons Dangereuses \u2013 they are as singular, demonstrative and theatrical as their golden robes, red shoes and turquoise frocks would suggest. This being Lochhead, Scotland\u2019s former national poet, they are also given to breathless sentences of inordinate length, all rococo flourishes and demotic shocks. There are lots of laughs. In a play subtitled \u201cWhit got him intae aw that bother\u201d, her theme is the playwright\u2019s pathological urge to self-destroy. No sooner has he gained the favour of the king than he writes a play, Tartuffe, that appears to mock religion. And at the very point his morals are being called into question, he runs off with a woman who may or may not be his daughter.     Female point of view \u2026 Chisholm as Moli\u00e8re with Sarah Miele as Menou. Photograph: Mihaela Bodlovic    Lochhead frames much of this from the female point of view: Sarah Miele\u2019s ingenue, Molly Innes\u2019s servant and Nicola Roy\u2019s apologetic feminist all find their voices alongside Redmond as a woman too smart to be defeated by circumstance. With Moli\u00e8re\u2019s adversaries all offstage, we don\u2019t feel the full weight of what\u2019s at stake, which mutes the dramatic impact, but there\u2019s vigour enough to compensate in Tony Cownie\u2019s excellently acted production.  At the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 11 June. Box office: 0131-248 4848.",
