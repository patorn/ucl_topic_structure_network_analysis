The deal sees the ultranationalist politician Avigdor Lieberman \u2013 a former nightclub bouncer \u2013 become defence minister, the second most important cabinet post behind the prime minister, joining a series of other hard-right figures now dominating key Israeli ministries.  Moshe Leon, a representative for Lieberman, and a government official said the deal would be signed on Wednesday.  Lieberman, a controversial and deeply divisive figure, replaces the popular former chief of staff Moshe Yaalon, who was pushed out last week as Netanyahu moved to expand his wafer-thin majority. Lieberman\u2019s invitation last week to join the government surprised political analysts as it came amid protracted negotiations with Israel\u2019s opposition leader, Isaac Herzog.

Despite claims by Netanyahu\u2019s office that Lieberman would be \u201cmoderate and pragmatic\u201d as defence minister \u2013 and that the prime minister remained committed to a two-state solution with Palestinians \u2013 most analysts viewed the composition of the new government as making the prospect of peace talks even more distant. The former Labour prime minister and defence minister Ehud Barak went even further, saying Israel\u2019s government had been \u201cinfected by the shoots of fascism\u201d.  Netanyahu has sought to ease fears over Lieberman\u2019s appointment, saying he will continue to seek peace with the Palestinians and oversee the defence ministry\u2019s policies, which include control over most of the occupied West Bank.  In a joint press conference with Lieberman on Wednesday the prime minister said: \u201cI am committed to peace with the Palestinians. My policy hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d  However, the peace process has been moribund since talks collapsed in April 2014.

Lieberman arrives in the Israeli defence ministry with a long history of harsh public remarks targeting both Israelis of Palestinian descent, the wider Arab world and Palestinians. He has called for the reconquest of Gaza and the bombing of Egypt\u2019s Aswan dam, and described Arab lawmakers in the Knesset as \u201ctraitors\u201d. As part of the deal to join the government he demanded the implementation of the death penalty for terrorism but in circumstances that would not be applicable to Jews accused of the same crime. Although his supporters point out that Lieberman \u2013 who lives in a settlement in the occupied West Bank \u2013 is open to a two-state solution, his vision includes the transfer of areas with Israeli Arab majorities out of Israel. Only a year ago Lieberman said Israeli Arabs disloyal to Israel \u201cdeserve to have their heads chopped off with an axe\u201d.  In a recent example of his provocative style he suggested Ismail Haniya, Hamas\u2019s leader in the Gaza Strip, be given 48 hours to hand over two detained Israeli civilians and the bodies of soldiers killed in a 2014 war \u201cor you\u2019re dead\u201d.

While he is an experienced politician who has been foreign minister and held other top jobs, his security background is limited. His political renaissance has surprised many not least because his Yisrael Beiteinu party \u2013 whose main constituency is Russian-speaking immigrants \u2013 has been struggling.  Among high-profile figures who have condemned Israel\u2019s ever sharper moves to the far right has been Yaalon himself, who warned of a rising tide of extremism in his party and the country as a whole. He is a member of Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud party and hawkish in his own opinions. International reaction has also been critical, with a New York Times editorial describing Lieberman\u2019s appointment as a \u201crisky and cynical\u201d move and saying it is now \u201centirely possible to imagine Israel\u2019s relations in the region and beyond moving backward\u201d.",
