  "body": "Here\u2019s something we all understand about conception: it\u2019s a private thing. So what was most difficult about in vitro fertilisation (IVF), says Gareth Farr, was juggling issues around conceiving a baby in the midst of a busy working life \u2013 but when no one else knew what was going on. \u201cI\u2019d be in a meeting or teaching a class and I\u2019d have to pretend I needed to use the bathroom so I could go off and find an empty room and take a call to find out how many embryos had been fertilised,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then I\u2019d have to phone my wife, Gabby, and tell her whatever crucial information had been imparted from the clinic, and then race back into the meeting or class and pretend nothing had happened.\u201d IVF is enormously stressful, but as a society we\u2019ve not really begun to unpack what that means for an individual, for a couple and their relationship, or for wider relationships within a family. With assisted conception on the rise \u2013 2% of all babies born in Britain are now conceived this way, and the number is increasing \u2013 it\u2019s becoming more important for the issues to be understood and for us as a society to at least acknowledge them, and perhaps to do more to help couples through what\u2019s involved. That\u2019s Gareth\u2019s view and based on his and Gabby\u2019s five-year quest for a baby, and all they went through, he\u2019s written a play that seeks to grapple with the issues \u2013 it opened this week in Birmingham before travelling to London.    I felt by turns emasculated, embarrassed, pathetic and ashamed  Gareth Farr     Like many couples, Gareth and Gabby thought that once they made the decision to have a child, one would simply come along. They\u2019d met in 2003 at the Young Vic \u2013 she\u2019s a theatre producer, he\u2019s a playwright and drama teacher. He remembers mentioning, on a visit to his GP to talk about something else, that they\u2019d been trying for a baby for several months. \u201cShe said 80% of couples get pregnant within a year of trying, just keep at it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then it got to a year and we were like, oh. Ok. So we\u2019re in the 20%.\u201d When they embarked on infertility treatment, they decided not to tell family and friends. \u201cFor a long time we didn\u2019t tell anyone else,\u201d says Gareth. \u201cWe thought, this is all going to work out, and then there will be a baby and we don\u2019t need to tell anyone how it all happened. So there was all this pain and anxiety and sadness in our lives, but we weren\u2019t sharing it \u2026 I wasn\u2019t sharing it with anyone because I was too proud.\u201d  What they hadn\u2019t realised \u2013 and this is one of the big issues Gareth aims to explore in the play \u2013 is how enormous the toll of that is on a couple and their relationship, as well as their work and career. \u201cI felt by turns emasculated, embarrassed, pathetic and ashamed,\u201d remembers Gareth, 38. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t sharing it with anyone, I was just desperately trying to cope. It\u2019s a man\u2019s role to support his partner, but while I was trying to support Gabby, I was crumbling inside. The IVF journey saps your energy, it takes you somewhere you didn\u2019t even know existed. It\u2019s overwhelming and shocking at every single turn. It\u2019s a bit like going through bereavement or cancer, but no one knows what\u2019s happening to you.\u201d   Related: IVF: 'I had the dread feeling that I was part of some greater experiment'    The other major issue for Gareth, and again one he explores in the play, is how it feels when something that should happen in the most private and intimate arena of a life, moves instead to a hospital clinic, a sperm production room and a laboratory.  \u201cIt has a big impact on your sex life \u2013 in fact, at times you aren\u2019t even allowed to have sex,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to have to mix Gabby\u2019s drugs and then inject her and it absolutely wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d ever thought we\u2019d be making a baby.\u201d  Another issue, he says, is that although conception should be a shared experience, in IVF the focus \u2013 often for understandable and necessary reasons \u2013 is on the woman and her body, but that can make a partner feel redundant and uncertain about what\u2019s required of him. \u201cAll the needles and the tests and the dropping your knickers at every turn was for me,\u201d says Gabby, 39. \u201cGareth said quite early on: \u2018I wish I could do my share.\u2019 At least I felt I was doing something \u2013 it was very physical, there were all these drugs and needles and tests.\u201d  \u201cFor me,\u201d says Gareth, \u201cit felt a bit like watching from the sidelines.\u201d    You won\u2019t find any pictures of our \u2018perfect family\u2019 on social media. I remember all too easily how that felt.  Gabby Vautier     The turning point for Gareth came when Gabby dragged him along to an infertility support group. \u201cI thought, I\u2019ll just sit in the corner and say nothing,\u201d he remembers.  In fact, they couldn\u2019t shut him up \u2013 and as well all the poured-out feelings came the realisation, from talking to others in the room, that theirs was a universal experience. \u201cI\u2019m a playwright, so I\u2019m always looking for human drama \u2013 and it was very clear I was surrounded by it,\u201d says Gareth. \u201cAlso, this is a subject that hasn\u2019t been much explored in the arts, especially the performing arts \u2013 and there are important issues here that deserve an airing.\u201d  He\u2019s also very aware, he says, that he and Gabby survived their IVF journey at least partly because they have a strong relationship \u2013 so how much harder must it be for a couple who are already feeling their connection is a bit ropey? Not to mention the fact that needing several rounds of IVF dents a couple\u2019s finances big-time \u2013 another guaranteed relationship iceberg. \u201cThe couple in the play struggle, as Gabby and I struggled, with how IVF chips away at every bit of your life,\u201d says Gareth. \u201cOf course there\u2019s humour, because there has to be humour in any journey you go on \u2013 you absolutely have to look for the lightness, you have to find it anywhere you can, because that can be a lifesaver.\u201d     Gareth and Gabby and their twin daughters, Astrid and Florrie, now 18 months old. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian    If you want to know the ending of Gareth\u2019s play you\u2019ll have to go and see it: but here\u2019s the ending of his and Gabby\u2019s real-life story. On the fourth round of IVF, having remortgaged their London flat (they live in Surrey now) and having survived the emotional rollercoaster of three failed attempts, Gabby\u2019s pregnancy test was positive. \u201cGareth said straightaway: I bet it\u2019s twins and I bet they\u2019re girls,\u201d she remembers. It was, and they were. So now it\u2019s Gareth and Gabby and 18-month olds Florrie and Astrid. \u201cWe\u2019ve become exactly the sort of couple I always hated when I was going through IVF, the kind whose stories end like this,\u201d says Gabby.  While their lives have gone through another seismic shift to parenthood \u2013 the shift they wanted all along \u2013 they both try very hard not to lose sight of the fact that many other couples and individuals are still out there, still on the IVF journey, still hoping, and still very sensitive to other people\u2019s stories. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any pictures of our \u2018perfect family\u2019 on social media,\u201d says Gabby. \u201cI remember all too easily how that felt.\u201d  Accompanying the play will be two day-long fertility festivals, which aim to open up discussion on many of the issues explored in the play. \u201cWe want to give people the space to talk about these incredibly difficult issues,\u201d says Gabby. Even when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s still there in the background. \u201cIt changes you \u2013 it\u2019s left scars, and it will always be part of us,\u201d says Gareth. \u201cWe\u2019re different from the parents we would have been.\u201d  He and Gabby know, too, that they are the lucky ones. Most people who go through IVF and experience all the emotional strain they experienced, don\u2019t emerge with a baby at all. How much tougher, they ask, is the fallout likely to be for them? The Quiet House by Gareth Farr is at Birmingham Repertory theatre until 4 June, and then at the Park theatre, London, 7 June to 9 July. The fertility festivals are on 28 May in Birmingham, and 11 June in London. For the full programme see fertilityfest.com",
