  "body": "Late in 1934, a handsome, sandy haired American, 26 years old, finished his graduate coursework in economics at University of California, Berkeley. Just months earlier, though, Bob Merriman had absorbed a more jolting lesson on economics. He had volunteered in a union publicity office for striking workers on the San Francisco wharf. The rough-and-tumble blue-collar city was rocked by sailors, truck drivers, harbour pilots and longshoremen, striking against shipping companies. Along the waterfront, helmeted soldiers manned sandbag barricades and a machine gun nest: 130,000 people stopped working throughout the Bay Area and the governor marshalled 4,500 national guardsmen to confront the strikers. After tear gas grenades set a hillside of dry grass on fire, the city looked like a war zone. Strikes aside, Merriman enjoyed his studies among a cadre of ambitious fellow students, including a young Canadian, John Kenneth Galbraith. The same year, rebellious coal miners in northern Spain seized local banks, factories and mines. Spanish soldiers extinguished the protests; the artillery-wielding troops killed at least 1,000 strikers and threw others in prison. Vanquished miners saw their wives raped. Soldiers severed miners\u2019 hands, genitals and tongues; some wore wire necklaces adorned with the strikers\u2019 sliced-off ears. The young general who presided over the rout was lauded as one of Europe\u2019s most up-and-coming military leaders, a rough-hewn soldier named Francisco Franco, whom the Associated Press proclaimed \u201cSpain\u2019s Man of the Hour\u201d. It was a world away from Merriman\u2019s life geographically, but not politically. In the landmark elections of 1936 in Spain, the Popular Front \u2013 a coalition of liberal, socialist, secular, feminist and communist forces \u2013 defeated a coalition of wealthy industrialists, landowners, the Catholic Church and military loyalists. Rightwing forces, led by Franco, launched a military coup against the newly elected republican government, igniting the three-year civil war. Merriman decided to get involved. He documented, then joined, the struggle \u2013 an adventure \u201cmore rich, thrilling, and interesting\u201d than he\u2019d ever known. His ideological love affair with the republican cause in Spain, the similar fervour of his wife, Marion, and their relationship with each other, are at the core of Adam Hochschild\u2019s Spain in Our Hearts. Merriman was among roughly 32,000 men and women who arrived in Spain from all over the world to fight on the republican side, including approximately 2,800 Americans. On a sort of personal and ideological pilgrimage, the foreigners volunteered as soldiers, nurses, ambulance drivers, translators and labourers. Singing communist anthems, the early deployments packed \u201cthe Red Express\u201d chugging from France to Spain, sharing wine, cheese, salami and baguettes, eager for an adventure to remake themselves, while remaking the world. All manner of Americans enlisted, though the prototypical enlistee was \u201ca New Yorker, a communist, an immigrant or the son of immigrants, a trade unionist\u201d \u2013 ie \u201ca working-class Jew\u201d. It was an era of economic crisis, in which general strikes, monetary collapses and vast swaths of homelessness were affecting the US and Europe. Millions felt a sense of despair and urged action; Spain provided a sharp focus. Stalin\u2019s purges were far from general knowledge, so communism held powerful appeal. And fascism enjoyed its own allure. After Hitler grabbed power, promising deliverance to his reeling people, the Canadian prime minister compared him to Joan of Arc. The F\u00fchrer was wooing admirers among Spanish generals, English nobility and American oligarchs, all threatened by populist movements. Portugal, Poland, Greece, Lithuania and Romania, alongside the Third Reich and Mussolini\u2019s Italy, all suffered under far-right regimes or dictators. \u201cFascism,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Malraux lamented, \u201chas spread its great black wings over Europe.\u201d Many soldiers on both sides of the civil war felt that their fate was being decided elsewhere. Stalin\u2019s regime sent the republican fighters antiquated guns and tanks, and tried to manipulate the war from Moscow. Members of the British elite hedged their bets, with indifference. \u201cIf there is somewhere where fascists and Bolsheviks can kill each other off,\u201d sniffed British prime minister Stanley Baldwin, \u201cso much the better.\u201d In private, Franklin D Roosevelt dithered. Publicly he championed the US\u2019s neutrality laws, which banned arms sales to either side. Hitler and Mussolini supplied Franco with troops, warplanes and weapons \u2013 assistance estimated to cost between $432m and $692m then, or from $7bn to $11bn today. The conflict emerged as a staging ground, or gruesome rehearsal, for the second world war. Spain in Our Hearts offers little in the way of new information, except for a fascinating account of Texaco\u2019s crucial role in bankrolling Franco. Hochschild\u2019s contribution lies in the storytelling, his sure command of military history, and his beautiful sense of private hurt, which together yield original insight. An astute observer of contrasts, he navigates the hairpin turns between intimacy and barbarism, euphoria and despair, naivety and cynicism. The book effortlessly hopscotches from global history to individual \u2013 and emotional \u2013 experience. \u201cThe whole experience of being hit by a bullet is very interesting and I think it is worth describing in detail,\u201d wrote republican volunteer George Orwell. \u201cThere must have been two minutes during which I assumed that I was killed. My first thought, conventionally enough, was for my wife. My second was a violent resentment at having to leave this world, which, when all is said and done, suits me so well. The stupid mischance infuriated me. The meaningless of it! To be bumped off, not even in battle, but in this stale corner of the trenches, thanks to a moment\u2019s carelessness.\u201d Manning a frontline trench, Orwell had absent-mindedly poked his head above a parapet, and taken a sniper\u2019s bullet. It missed his carotid artery by a few millimetres. Witnessing the imprisonment, torture and killings ordered by Stalin\u2019s Spanish henchmen against his fellow leftists, disillusioned him, though he continued fighting loyally. \u201cWhichever way you took it,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit was a depressing outlook. But it did not follow that the government was not worth fighting for as against the more naked and developed fascism of Franco and Hitler.\u201d    The book is as much about language and letters as munitions and battalions    Hochschild sifts from history an entertaining cast: Pat, a 26-year-old London sculptor describing himself as an old-fashioned radical, though sceptical of the humourless communists (\u201cAny hint of levity was treated like farting in a church\u201d). Milly, a brassy American journalist who is more irreverent than the boys and \u201ccould cuss you from hell to breakfast\u201d; Louis Fischer, a self-important American writer whose ambition initially blinds him to the hypocrisies of communist politics; and Virginia, a well-turned-out former debutante, who is dismissed for her beauty, though she observes events more astutely than other scribes. Love letters in at least three languages made their way to Fischer, including from Svetlana Alliluyeva, \u201cthe rebellious daughter of Stalin\u201d. Hochschild\u2019s book is as much about language and letters as munitions and battalion movements \u2013 tempestuous love notes, heartsick homebound letters, soldiers\u2019 diaries, journalists\u2019 memoirs and news coverage in print. Spain in Our Hearts shows how atrocities were reflected in the word: how the word helped his protagonists cope with the war, and interpret it for their contemporaries and for history; and how the word, particularly journalism and correspondence between influential people, shaped the war\u2019s conduct and outcome (Hemingway\u2019s mistress Martha Gellhorn sent urgent letters begging Eleanor Roosevelt to lobby her husband to intervene). \u201cMen of my generation have had Spain in our hearts,\u201d Albert Camus wrote in L\u2019Espagne Libre, providing the title for this elegant book, written with sharp analytical authority. Under Hochschild\u2019s sure prose, however, can be heard the wavering nostalgia of a baby boomer yearning for a time when wars had more moral clarity. His generational tribe broadly supported peace movements, and generally opposed US intervention in cold war flashpoints, from Vietnam to Nicaragua to El Salvador, and the invasion of Iraq. But Hochschild artfully coaxes the reader into thinking that the world would have been better off for generations had western democracies, especially the US, not stood aside during Spain\u2019s cardinal war. He asks: when is military involvement in a distant conflict justified or even demanded? And \u2013 topically enough \u2013 what makes people, so daring and imperfect, leave places like Berkeley or London, to volunteer to fight in other countries\u2019 wars? At the book\u2019s opening, Merriman disappears in battle. The book\u2019s elegiac coda gives details of the Berkeley student\u2019s death, quoting the letters of his distraught widow. Spain in Our Hearts closes also with an elderly American woman travelling in 2012 to an old battlefield to commemorate her disappeared brother\u2019s death in 1938. \u201cI told him we honoured his goodness and idealism and that the world turned out to be a much more politically complicated truth then he could ever have known.\u201d \u2022 Rich Benjamin is the author of Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America.
