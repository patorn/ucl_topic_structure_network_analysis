Energy minister Andrea Leadsom has been to inspect them herself and raved about them last week to a select committee of MPs. They were evidence, she suggested, of the depth of commitment of French firm EDF to the \u00a318bn nuclear power station due to be built on the site. Well, maybe. Talk of bats and hedgehogs at least provided some relief from the familiar crop of Hinkley news. French economy minister Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201cfully behind\u201d the project but EDF\u2019s unions confirmed that they weren\u2019t. Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of EDF\u2019s workers\u2019 committee, told the BBC that the unions \u201chave reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation and procurement\u201d. That\u2019s a long list. Meanwhile, EDF Energy chief executive Vincent de Rivaz, appearing before the same committee as Leadsom, had to adopt a humbler tone than on his last outing two months ago. Then he had promised a final investment decision \u201cvery soon\u201d; this time he wouldn\u2019t speculate about a date. This farce \u2013 which has been running since last October, when the final sign-off was due within weeks \u2013 could yet roll on and on. The UK government is disinclined to set a deadline: it\u2019s a \u201ccommercial decision\u201d for EDF. Meanwhile, the current French government could have a radically different shape this time next year \u2013 there is a presidential election in 2017 and the incumbent, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is the least popular leader in modern French history. French union opposition to Hinkley Point appears entrenched and the workers\u2019 representatives have six seats on an 18-strong board. In theory, management and government can proceed regardless; but to embark on an \u00a318bn venture with a divided boardroom would invite trouble down the line. That is especially so when you remember EDF\u2019s last finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned over concerns that Hinkley could threaten the company\u2019s future. The best thing the UK government could do at this point is to stop and consider whether the obstacles facing Hinkley are simply too big. Nervousness in France is understandable. EDF\u2019s two current attempts to built a European pressurised reactor \u2013 the model to be used at Hinkley \u2013 are agonising; one is four years late, the other nine years. And the financial arithmetic was always challenging. Hinkley could take 10 years to build, and the owners receive nothing during the construction phase; the cash only arrives when electricity starts to be generated. And, while the returns on capital under the 35-year contract are theoretically enormous, the penalties for failure to hit a 2029 deadline are stinging, and ratchet up. That is why the UK government had to make the 35-year contract so generous \u2013 struck at almost three times today\u2019s wholesale price. That contract now looks to belong to another era given the subsequent fall in the oil price, and thus energy costs. The only weak support holding Hinkley in place is its capacity to provide 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity in a low-carbon fashion. But there are other ways to meet the legally binding emissions targets. Offshore wind is expanding with no Hinkley-style fuss, and its costs are falling. More importantly for the UK\u2019s requirement for secure baseload supplies, other builders are waiting to pursue projects that use different nuclear technology. In theory, planning and appraisal can continue in parallel; in practice, confidence in the UK\u2019s commitment to its new-nuclear programme will drain away. There is not \u2013 yet \u2013 a crisis in UK energy policy because it is always possible to build a few gas-fired stations to avert an emergency. But the Hinkley show is becoming an embarrassment. The project is expensive, uses unproven technology and its builder is a disunited and over-borrowed company that requires constant financial assurances from an ever-changing cast of politicians. The UK government should set EDF a deadline and be ready to enforce it. We can do better \u2013 much better \u2013 than Hinkley. Banking guru says Bank is too soft on banks When the architect of banking reform in the UK accuses the Bank of England of going soft on the sector, it is time to sit up and take notice. Sir John Vickers, who led the coalition government\u2019s Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), made the assertion again last week when Threadneedle Street issued new guidelines on capital which concluded that the system (largely) had amassed enough capital. While no one appears to doubt that the banking system is stronger than it was before the 2008 crisis \u2013 the amount of capital held by banks globally has doubled since 2007 \u2013 Vickers believes that the Bank should be asking banks to hold even more. While the argument about systemic risk buffers is not easy to digest, it is worth taking a moment to think about it. Vickers argues that the Bank is being too lenient in adopting one of the ICB\u2019s recommendations \u2013 about putting 3% of capital aside as a systemic risk buffer (think of it as a bit of extra insurance in case things go bad). The Bank says the buffer can be on a rising scale, depending on the size of the bank. On its current assessment no UK bank would need to hit the 3% level. It might be easy to decide that Vickers \u2013 now warden at All Soul\u2019s College, Oxford \u2013 is making the point to protect his legacy. Indeed one of his fellow commission members \u2013 former Barclays boss Martin Taylor \u2013 last week insisted that the differences in capital requirements between the ICB and the Bank of England were \u201cmore or less invisible to the naked eye\u201d. Taylor, it should be noted, is now a policymaker at the Bank. So, too, is chief economist Andy Haldane who, in seeming contrast, has welcomed what he describes as the \u201cacademic challenge\u201d of prudential regulation. While easily dismissed as a topic for anoraks, this issue is simply too important to ignore. Just as well that Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has decided to step in to referee. In April, Tyrie announced an inquiry into the matter. He should get on with it. M&S needs to put clothes ahead of shareholders Marks & Spencer\u2019s share price is 13% lower than it was last weekend and its new chief executive finds his ambition to \u201ccherish Mrs M&S\u201d derided as patronising waffle. Welcome to retailing\u2019s top table, Steve Rowe: now you know how deep the national obsession with M&S goes. You\u2019re under the microscope. Rowe shouldn\u2019t worry about the share price. His grand strategic plan is to sell clothes his customers actually want to wear, and at keener prices. Easier said than done, of course, but it\u2019s the right priority. M&S\u2019s share price has been sustained for too long by the thin vapours of ever-rising profit margins. Now the website actually works, it\u2019s time to address the loss of market share over many years, and never mind the immediate hit to profits. Shareholders will just have to be patient. But bin the \u201cMrs M&S\u201d lines. The 1970s language is one problem. The bigger drawback is that no one wants to be viewed as a caricature.",
