  "body": "Advice published by a top Melbourne private school that children being bullied need to take responsibility for their \u201cpart of the problem\u201d has been described as victim blaming. A blog post titled \u201cBullying: helping your son be the victor, not the victim\u201d was published on the website of the private school Brighton Grammar in its Understanding Boys section. It was written by counsellor and self-described \u201cresilience coach\u201d Melissa Anderson before her free seminar for parents at the school on Wednesday night. \u201cAs a resilience coach I am adamant that, in any bullying situation, you must own your part of the problem, no matter how small, no matter how unfair it may seem,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is lily-white and blameless.\u201d   Related: Appearance bullying \u2013 and the damage it does to children\u2019s education    Anderson encouraged parents of boys being bullied to ask themselves \u2013 \u201cin the spirit of cleaning up your side of the street\u201d \u2013 if their sons were \u201cpart of the problem\u201d. \u201cIs he a whinger, a complainer, self-absorbed, an exaggerator, loose with the truth, a passive doormat, displaying negative body language, an approval addict, a try hard, critical or a bad sport?\u201d She wrote that children being bullied about their physical appearance or a disability could not be blamed \u2013 but they could \u201cown [their] part\u201d and learn to develop \u201cgrit, steely self-belief\u201d [and] strong self-esteem\u201d. \u201cTime to own your part, and stop playing the victim,\u201d she said. \u201cBe the victor, not the victim.\u201d Anderson is listed as director of the Shine Academy for Girls and the Longford & Fraser Leadership Academy for Boys. Brighton Grammar is an independent Anglican school for boys from early childhood until year 12. It maintains a Facebook page, Understanding Boys, \u201cfor parents to share the common challenge and joys of raising boys\u201d that is followed by nearly 20,000 people. Though the post was published on the school\u2019s website this month, it became the subject of media coverage in Melbourne on Monday. Since then, the school\u2019s Facebook page has been inundated with comments condemning Anderson\u2019s advice. \u201cWell, this is why bully victims commit suicide,\u201d posted Miranda Griggs. \u201cCongratulations for being complete pretentious snobs!\u201d Erin Johnston, who identified as both a parent of a bullied child and a counsellor, wrote that Anderson\u2019s advice was \u201cway off\u201d: \u201cThere is a vast difference between teaching resilience and victim blaming and your message crossed the line.\u201d The school\u2019s headmaster, Ross Featherston, responded to criticism of Anderson\u2019s post published in the Age on Tuesday with a statement on the school\u2019s website. He acknowledged \u201csome strong response\u201d to the article, including \u201cmany comments \u2026 by parents external to the school\u201d on Facebook. \u201cBullying is an extremely sensitive issue and we deeply regret any upset or distress caused to parents \u2013 this was not our intention,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is a school\u2019s responsibility to be proactive about bullying.\u201d He said the school had a clearly articulated and publicly available policy on bullying and ran many programs for students about respectful relationships. He also said that Anderson\u2019s advice was \u201chighly regarded \u2026 and independent to the school\u201d. Some people responding to the post on social media remarked on the aggression of the response to it.    All of us outraged by that Brighton Grammar bullying stuff need to be extra careful today to steer clear of bullying or shaming its writer.\u2014 Mat Larkin (@matchtrick) May 16, 2016      No irony lost on how many bullies have come out of woodwork to bully Brighton Grammar. They exhibit the very behaviour they rail against.\u2014 Margie Warrell (@margiewarrell) May 16, 2016    Both Anderson and Brighton Grammar have been contacted by Guardian Australia for comment, and to clarify whether Anderson\u2019s seminar on Wednesday is going ahead.  Titled \u201cWho are the bullies and why are they targeting your child?\u201d, it promises to equip children being bullied and their parents with \u201ccoping skills \u2026 to be assertive and flourish in the playground and in life\u201d. \u201cApplicable to boys and girls. Adults will also find it relevant.\u201d",
