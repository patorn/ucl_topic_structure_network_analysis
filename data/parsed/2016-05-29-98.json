  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull conceded bipartisanship on climate change was desirable and committed to meet higher targets if set by the global community in the second leaders\u2019 debate of the Australian election campaign. But the prime minister failed to outline how Australia would reach the 2030 emission reduction targets agreed to in Paris. Bill Shorten, the Labor leader, baited Turnbull, asking: \u201cWhatever happened to the old Malcolm Turnbull on climate change?\u201d \u201cYou were so impressive when you were leading on climate change,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cNow you\u2019re just implementing Tony Abbott\u2019s policies.\u201d  Turnbull, who lost the Liberal leadership to Tony Abbott in 2009 over his commitment to climate change policy, said the Coalition completely supported the science of global warming.    Related: No winners on election debate night when answers were scripted and ideas untested    \u201cBipartisanship is always desirable on issues \u2013 long-term issues \u2013 like this,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cMy view is, as somebody who is committed to action on climate change and who has paid a high price for my commitment to that issue, for my commitment to global action in the past \u2013 my commitment is to ensure that Australia meets the target we agreed to in Paris. And when the global community agrees to higher targets, as I have no doubt it will, that we will meet them, too.\u201d Shorten attacked Turnbull\u2019s support for Abbott policy of Direct Action which created the existing emissions reduction fund \u2013 a policy he originally described as bullshit. No clear winner emerged out of the second debate, held at the National Press Club in Canberra before a panel of press gallery journalists. The issues raised included asylum seekers, tax policy, trust, superannuation policy and whether the new government would emerge with a mandate, particularly in the senate. Turnbull began the debate with a pitch on the rise of the middle class in Asia, which he said represented both \u201copportunity and uncertainty\u201d. \u201cWithin a few years, half of the world\u2019s middle class will be living to our north in east Asia,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cWe have seen the pace of change in technology as great businesses and great industries are overtaken by newcomers. These are times of enormous opportunity and uncertainty. \u201cWe measure the economy in numbers and percentages and growth figures. But where it counts is with every single Australian\u2019s life and their opportunities.\u201d Turnbull invoked Indigenous innovation as an example of both reconciliation and an opportunity for \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. Shorten used his introduction to outline his health and education policies \u2013 considered strengths for Labor \u2013 while comparing the government\u2019s corporate tax cuts to the policies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. \u201cThese economic theories have been tested before by Thatcher and Reagan but it\u2019s a very risky expensive gamble to take with Australian taxpayer money for little economic benefit,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cLabor has the best plans to ensure real jobs, genuine growth and fairness.\u201d  The first question addressed the issue of apparent voter disappointment that Turnbull has been inhibited by his party since becoming prime minister. \u201cWill they see a different Malcolm Turnbull if you win your own mandate to the one that they see now?\u201d  Turnbull failed to address the question, instead using climate change as an example of how his views had not changed. Shorten honed in on voter disappointment in Turnbull and linked the prime minister back to his predecessor Tony Abbott. \u201cWhen Mr Turnbull got elected eight or 10 months ago, I thought my job would be harder but I thought the politics would go to a better place in this country,\u201d Shorten said.  \u201cI thought we would see a more elevated debate about ideas but on each issue I see this government shrinking in to an Abbott-style government of three-word slogans and scare campaigns.\u201d Both men were asked how they could be trusted when Turnbull deposed Abbott and Shorten was involved in moving against the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd and then supported Rudd against Julia Gillard.  Shorten said Labor had learned from the 43rd parliament. \u201cLabor\u2019s learnt its lesson about that difficult period and I\u2019m fortunate to lead a very united team,\u201d Shorten said. Both men invoked the influence of their parents, Shorten his mother and Turnbull his father. The prime minister delivered a very personal pitch for voter trust. \u201cI had a great education, I was brought up by a single dad who didn\u2019t have much money,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cAnd he struggled to send me to school, and I had some really charismatic teachers that transformed my life. I would not be where I am today without them. \u201cI am a well-known quantity in Australian public life. I did not come into this role as apolitical activist. Did not come in here as a political staffer. I came into this role as an adult. At 50. After a lifetime of working, building businesses.\u201d Asked if Labor had a ceiling on how much tax should be collected as a proportion of the economy, Shorten would not reveal total costings but promised to reveal forecasts before the election. \u201cI undertake before this election campaign is over we will provide all of our forecasts once we have released all of our policies \u2013 which we haven\u2019t yet,\u201d Shorten said.  Turnbull was asked how company tax cuts would improve jobs rather than be passed on the shareholders.   Related: Turnbull and Shorten face off in Australian leaders debate \u2013 in pictures    \u201cThe companies up to $10m in turnover employ 5 million Australians and they will all benefit from that support because they will see more investment in their business. This is why other countries have reduced their company tax rate,\u201d Turnbull said. Four weeks into a double dissolution election on the Australian Building and Construction Commission following a combative Snate, neither leader would promise to respect the other\u2019s mandate in the next parliament.  And Turnbull again promised never to bring any asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus to Australia. \u201cI can rule out any of the detainees coming to Australia,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cLabor taught all of us a very, very harsh lesson. They proved what happens if you abandon secure borders. Thousands of arrivals, deaths at sea, the people smugglers back in business.\u201d Shorten again promised Labor have an identical policy on people smuggling.  \u201cWhoever forms the government after 2 July, there will be no change in policy about our determination to defeat the people smugglers, the criminal syndicates who play and prey upon people, taxi them out to sea and in too many tragic cases drown,\u201d he said. But he said he would instruct his immigration minister to talk immediately to the UN about resettling asylum seekers in offshore detention on Nauru and Manus.",
