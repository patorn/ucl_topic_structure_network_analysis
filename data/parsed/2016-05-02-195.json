  "body": "Tottenham midfielder Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has hit back at Chelsea\u2019s Eden Hazard, suggesting his Belgium team-mate is envious of their success. Hazard, who scored his first Premier League goals of the season in last week\u2019s win over Bournemouth, said afterwards that Chelsea\u2019s players are determined not to allow London rivals Spurs to win the title.   Related: Eden Hazard happy at Chelsea, insists Guus Hiddink after win at Bournemouth    The two sides meet on Monday evening with Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side knowing anything less than a victory will see Leicester crowned champions. Tottenham have not beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge since 1990 but Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 admitted he would be speaking to Hazard before the match to discuss his comments. \u201cI am surprised at what Eden has said. He is not the type of person to normally make those types of comments or to envy other people\u2019s success,\u201d the former Fulham player told The Sun. \u201cI\u2019m wondering whether he said that stuff because it is what he really thinks, or whether he was just talking for the sake of it. Tottenham play some of the most attractive football in the Premier League \u2014 we have a beautiful style of play. \u201cBut I won\u2019t pay too much heed to his comments and those from Cesc F\u00e0bregas, who has said similar things. People come up to me in the street and say: \u2018Did you hear what Hazard said? What\u2019s his problem?\u2019 \u201cI will have a word with Eden before the game, although I will make a joke of it. I won\u2019t conduct a half-hour interview with him. I am convinced he didn\u2019t think about what he said.\u201d Hazard missed more than a month with a hip injury having not enjoyed his most productive of seasons. The 25-year-old is now attempting prove his fitness having played for the entire match against Bournemouth. \u201cI hope to return to top form,\u201d Hazard told Canal+. \u201cI know that if I have a good Euros, my bad season will be forgotten. \u201cI am at 80-85% of my abilities. Physical fitness comes with games.\u201d He added: \u201cEvery season is different but for the last six years I was at the top. When I was in France I was on the top and it is the first time in my career when I feel I am not on the top, but I need to learn. I am still young, I need to learn every day. I hope it will be better next year.\u201d",
