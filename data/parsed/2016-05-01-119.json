Now Barack Obama is trying to break that stalemate by creating a market for smart guns among law enforcement agencies around the US. Some gun rights advocates view smart guns with suspicion, fearing that the new technology will be pushed on gun owners unwillingly, as a New Jersey law tried to do in 2002. The guns use fingerprint sensors or RFID tags to prevent the weapons from being fired by anyone except an authorized user.

In a Friday report, touted by the White House as a milestone in the president\u2019s uphill battle to reduce gun violence, federal agencies said they were working with law enforcement officials to develop standards for smart guns that could be used by police officers. Once those new standards are released, the agencies will encourage law enforcement officers to volunteer to test smart guns in the field. They have promised that federal funding will be available to help police departments and other agencies buy new guns.  If the technology can meet the standards \u2013 and if agencies can cooperate \u2013 the purchasing power of the federal government could be an enormous boost to the nascent industry. Executives \u201cwho are saying they are ready, wiling, and able to make a smart gun have been saying, \u2018All that we need is a purchase order that\u2019s large enough to turn the machines on,\u2019\u201d said Stephen Teret, a leading smart gun expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  He called the White House\u2019s smart gun plan \u201cwonderful\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s very measured and logical and it doesn\u2019t force anyone to do anything,\u201d he said.  In advance of the White House report, some law enforcement officials had expressed trepidation that police officers would be forced to use the new guns, with one national police union official telling Politico that officers \u201cshouldn\u2019t be asked to be the guinea pigs in evaluating a firearm that nobody\u2019s even seen yet\u201d. The smart gun report, produced by the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security, said the smart gun push was \u201cnot a mandate that any particular individual or law enforcement agency adopt the technology once developed\u201d. According to the White House\u2019s report, law enforcement agencies \u201cwill be invited to make voluntary commitments\u201d about developing or buying smart guns. Agencies could volunteer, for instance, to buy a small number of smart guns to conduct a pilot program. Jonathan Mossberg, the CEO of iGun Technology Corporation, a Florida-based company that has developed a smart shotgun, said the White House\u2019s push to support new gun technology could be a \u201cwindfall\u201d for smart gun companies. He said his push to bring a smart gun to market had stalled since around 2002.  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise money, and I think this could make it a while lot easier to raise money,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people can see the size of the market.\u201d  But Mossberg said he also worried that the White House\u2019s push, particularly the pledge to subsidize the cost for departments that want to buy the new guns, would create an \u201cartificial market\u201d for smart guns.  \u201cLet\u2019s say a gun company who has been against this type of development now sees an artificial market bolstered by the government,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could pour all their resources into developing the technology and leapfrog over people like me.\u201d  Teret, the Johns Hopkins expert, compared Obama\u2019s smart gun push to a 1968 pledge from Dr William Hadden, then the head of a federal highway safety agency, that the government would work collaboratively the the automobile industry to improve safety by adding airbags to cars.  Hadden said the government \u201cwould act as a midwife to help deliver the airbags\u201d, Teret recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s what President Obama is saying. He\u2019s saying the government can help with the delivery of the product to the marketplace.\u201d  Polls have found conflicting data about the support for smart guns among consumers. One 2013 firearms industry poll suggested only 14% of respondents would be likely to buy a smart gun; a more recent poll sponsored by public health researchers found that 43% of gun owners would consider buying a childproof handgun that could only be fired by its authorized user. Law enforcement agencies were a challenging initial marketplace for smart gun adoption, Teret said, because police officers had \u201cheightened needs\u201d when it came to their guns.  A police officer\u2019s firearm \u201chas to work when the policeman is wearing gloves. It has to be able to work if he\u2019s running through a swamp. It has to be able to work in zero degrees or 100 degrees. It has to work if it\u2019s clogged with mud,\u201d he said.  A 1996 report on smart guns found the technology \u201cwas not quite ready for policemen\u201d, Teret said. Since then, he said, \u201cready for policemen\u201d has become the gold standard for gun consumers, with some gun owners arguing, \u201cIf they\u2019re not reliable enough for policemen, they\u2019re not reliable enough for me.\u201d  Teret said that it might make sense to try to market smart guns to more tech-savvy consumers, the kind of people who want the latest iPad, as well as trying to make inroads into law enforcement market. One small 2003 study of unintentional gun deaths found that 37% of them could have been prevented with a personalized gun. The widespread consumer adoption of smart guns might also change the dynamics of America\u2019s illegal gun market, by making it difficult or impossible to use a gun stolen from its legal owner.  Teret said that researchers did not have a clear estimate for how many gun deaths and injuries the widespread adoption of smart gun technology could prevent. But he said the personalized technology had the potential of reducing accidental shootings, suicides and homicides. \u201cAs long as we have a chance to reduce those gun deaths in a substantial way, why shouldn\u2019t we do that?\u201d he said.  The National Rifle Association said it did not oppose smart gun technology.    Related: US must invest in 'smart guns' to reduce avoidable deaths, activists say    \u201cWe\u2019re not against the development of smart guns \u2013 we\u2019re against the mandated use,\u201d NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide said.  But the NRA did not welcome Obama\u2019s smart gun plan with particular warmth.   \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s obsession with gun control knows no boundaries,\u201d Jennifer Baker, director of public affairs for the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement Friday. \u201cAt a time when we are actively fighting terrorists at home and abroad, this administration would rather focus the military\u2019s efforts on the president\u2019s gun control agenda.\u201d The White House promised to release initial specifications for a law enforcement-approved smart gun on 15 July, and the final version of the specifications by 15 October. The White House also announced Friday that the social security administration was moving forward with a plan to submit some of its records to the nation\u2019s background check system for gun sales, and that the White House would host a conference in May to talk to local leaders from all 50 states about gun violence prevention strategies.",
