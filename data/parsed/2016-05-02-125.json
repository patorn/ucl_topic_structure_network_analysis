If you\u2019re not jammed into an overcrowded, unpunctual train or bus, you\u2019ll be struggling with jams and roadworks in your car, or trying not to be crushed by a lorry on your bike. It\u2019s no better if you\u2019re taking the kids to school or popping to the shops. Thanks to a combination of hypermobility and underinvestment, even the shortest journey can take you to hell and back.   Related: Just like cyclists, pedestrians must find a sense of self-righteousness | Zoe Williams    The thing is, it\u2019s partly our fault. We\u2019ve become so used to the idea that getting anywhere requires machinery, even if it\u2019s something as basic as a bike, that many of us have forgotten the original means of transport. That\u2019s right \u2013 our feet. A survey by the charity Living Streets, reported this morning, finds that almost half of Britons are unwilling to walk for 20 minutes, while a 2014 National Travel Survey, found that walking in England has fallen by almost a third since the mid-1990s. It\u2019s still the most popular way to cover distances of up to a mile, but beyond that we\u2019d rather take the car, train or bus. If you\u2019re not sure how long it takes to walk a mile, the route-planning website walkit.com suggests 20 minutes at a medium pace. In other words, if it would take us longer to walk somewhere than to cook a portion of oven chips, the vast majority of us can\u2019t be arsed. At a time of growing obesity and air pollution, we\u2019d rather burn fuel and conserve our fat reserves. If you\u2019re a walker yourself, it\u2019s depressing to sit on a bus and watch apparently healthy people travel just one or two stops (and I write as someone whose mother used to get in the car to visit the next-door neighbour.) You can\u2019t help wondering how long they\u2019ll stay well. In addition to obesity, walking has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, type-2 diabetes, asthma, strokes and some cancers.           How to walk better: improve your posture    As far as commuting\u2019s concerned, many journeys are too long for feet alone. In England and Wales the average commute is 9.3 miles (15km). But if you are at least moderately fit, and willing to bust the one-mile barrier and add a decent walk to the mixture, new possibilities open up. My own daily journey from south to central London, for example, is about eight miles as the crow flies, or perhaps two and a half hours on foot. If you don\u2019t have time to walk that every day \u2013 and who does? \u2013 the obvious alternatives combine an initial five- or 10-minute stroll with some multi-part combination of bus, train and tube. After a year of experimenting, I know that it\u2019s far more pleasant to walk either 25 minutes to the fourth-nearest railway station, or 50 minutes to the nearest tube, at which point I have a direct journey to my destination, no changes involved. It adds 10-20 minutes to my overall commute, but halves the number of weak links. My legs always work, whatever\u2019s going on with leaves on the line, signal failures, passengers taken sick or shortage of train crew. So long as I leave home on time, one part of the commute is sure to be stress-free.   Related: Why is Britain such a dangerous place for walkers?    Like many cities, London does as little as possible to help walkers. Not only are there too few pedestrian crossings, subways and bridges, with motorists blatantly given priority, but signage ranges from the non-existent to barely adequate. Meanwhile, the most widely available and prominently displayed map \u2013 of tube lines and suburban rail services \u2013 does an impressive job of explaining which line(s) will take you to which station(s), but gives a completely misleading impression of walking times between them, should you get into your head that you\u2019d rather see a little daylight as you travel around. The result is that many of us experience the city as an archipelago of remote islands, each centred around a tube or rail station. Meanwhile, outgoing mayor Boris Johnson obsesses about cycling, alternately patting himself on the back for encouraging it and fretting about its future once he is gone. When the listings magazine Time Out suggested he was going to introduce a congestion charge for pedestrians entering the West End, the April fool was all too believable. With Britons getting fatter and the air getting filthier, you\u2019d think officials would be pulling out all the stops to tempt us off cars, trains and buses. \u201cIf we all swapped one weekly drive for walking,\u201d the charity Sustrans says, \u201ctraffic would reduce by at least 10%. Imagine that.\u201d Yes, imagine that. There would be some investment required, to properly maintain pavements or even create them on some country roads, to vastly increase the numbers of crossings, and to shower walkers with free maps, just like bus and tube passengers. In the short term, we\u2019d probably need a walking tsar to get things started, a big publicity campaign to remind people what those things at the end of their legs are meant for, and an army of volunteers to get the idle back on their feet. We might even need to buy proper shoes for those who only own high heels or flip-flops. But that shouldn\u2019t be a problem for a nation that can find \u00a3175m to build a \u201cgarden bridge\u201d that nobody wants, or \u00a356bn to speed up journeys between one congested city and another.",
