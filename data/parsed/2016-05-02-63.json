  "body": "The president of Iceland is expected to come under pressure this week after leaked documents appeared to show that part of his wife\u2019s considerable fortune was held in offshore tax havens. \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson, who has been in office for 20 years, last month surprised many by declaring he would stand for re-election again after serving five terms. His decision was prompted by the Panama Papers scandal, which forced Iceland\u2019s prime minister to resign.  There was now \u201ca strong demand for stability [and] experience\u201d, said 72-year-old Gr\u00edmsson, who is on course to win a landslide victory according to the polls.  A presidential spokesman said Gr\u00edmsson has never had any knowledge of his wife Dorrit Moussaieff\u2019s financial affairs, which her lawyers said have always been conducted legally. Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson resigned as prime minister last month, days after the Guardian and other media published details of a secretive investment company called Wintris, based in the British Virgin Islands, which he had owned with his wife. The information was from the Panama Papers, the largest ever data leak to journalists, which was obtained by German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) with the Guardian, the BBC and other media. Gunnlaugsson\u2019s links to Wintris, which he said did not need to be declared on the parliamentary register of financial interests, sparked mass protest in Reykjavik forcing him from office. Just over two weeks later, Gr\u00edmsson \u2013 who praised the expos\u00e9 as \u201ca great public service\u201d and \u201cimportant wake-up call\u201d for politicians \u2013 declared there would be no similar revelations concerning offshore accounts held by him or his wife, a wealthy London jeweller and socialite. \u201cNo. No, no, no, no,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be the case.\u201d But previously unreported papers \u2013 part of a leak from HSBC\u2019s private bank in Geneva \u2013 show Moussaieff had links to offshore companies and to trusts registered outside the UK. Leaked bank files show Iceland\u2019s first lady listed as one of three Moussaieff family members who jointly owned a company in the British Virgin Islands called Jaywick Properties Inc. She was also a beneficiary of the Moussaieff Sharon Trust, according to the files.  In addition, the HSBC files suggest Moussaieff, who is non-domiciled for UK tax purposes, was in line to inherit further portions of her family\u2019s offshore wealth when her 86-year-old mother, Alisa, dies. The Moussiaeff family are best known for running a jewellery shop on New Bond Street, Mayfair, catering to London\u2019s super-rich. Building up the business over generations, they are now among the world\u2019s wealthiest jewellers. According to the Sunday Times\u2019 annual rich list Alisa Moussaieff and her family have a fortune worth an estimated \u00a3200m.  Information on her daughter\u2019s financial affairs taken from the HSBC files may well be out of date as the data covers a period of to 2005 to 2007. Asked if she still linked to Jaywick, the Moussaieff Sharon Trust, or any other aspect of the family\u2019s offshore holdings, her lawyers declined to comment. They said her business interests were always carried out legally and they were a private matter. Moussaieff\u2019s lawyers also said that she and Gr\u00edmsson conducted their business affairs separately from one another and did not therefore know anything about each other\u2019s financial circumstances. Asked about the first lady\u2019s offshore interests, a spokesman for the president said: \u201c[Gr\u00edmsson] has no knowledge of [them] nor has he ever heard of them.\u201d He added: \u201cPresident Gr\u00edmsson does not have, nor has he at any time had, any information about the financial affairs of his wife or other members of the Moussaieff family.\u201d In the run-up to Iceland\u2019s presidential election next month Gr\u00edmsson has spoken out against the use of complex offshore structures. \u201cI think one of the reasons people came out on the street was \u2026 moral disgust,\u201d he said.   \u201cWe now live in a very open and transparent world. And everybody has to be accountable to the people in a way that people can for themselves see.\u201d",
