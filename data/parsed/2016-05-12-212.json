  "body": "Schubert\u2019s Winterreise, his \u201cWinter Journey\u201d, a cycle of 24 songs for voice and piano, is the monstre sacr\u00e9 of the German classical Lieder tradition, a landmark in the history of Romanticism, and an inspiration to numerous cultural icons from Samuel Beckett to Thomas Mann. I\u2019ve now been singing it for more than 30 years. When I started I was a 20-year-old history undergraduate; now I\u2019m a 51-year-old professional singer. I\u2019ve approached this extraordinary work from all sorts of angles. I\u2019ve sung it \u201cstraight\u201d, in halls all over the world, dressed in concert gear. I\u2019ve made a TV film of it with the director David Alden, broadcast in 1997, the year of Schubert bicentenary. I\u2019ve recorded it with the Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes. I\u2019ve dramatised it with the pianist Julius Drake, on the vast stage of the Teatro Comunale in Florence, under the direction of Roberto And\u00f2. Most recently, I\u2019ve written a book about it, Schubert\u2019s Winter Journey: Anatomy of an Obsession. And here I am, returning to it again, at the Barbican. Obsession indeed.    I\u2019ve always felt a connection between Hamlet, the great soliloquiser, and the protagonist of Winterreise    Except that I\u2019m not performing Schubert\u2019s Winterreise this week in London. I\u2019m singing Hans Zender\u2019s \u201ccomposed interpretation\u201d of the piece, for orchestra. And I\u2019m not just singing it, but delivering it in a multimedia staging directed and designed by Netia Jones. Zender\u2019s piece, originally written in 1993, has achieved enormous success, with several recordings and many, many performances all over the world. Born in 1936, a controversial chief of the Hamburg State Opera in the 1980s, Zender has been a longstanding figure in the German musical avant garde. As such, he has has often been compared to the hugely influential, recently deceased Frenchman Pierre Boulez, 10 years his senior: both worked as conductors, educators and essayists; musical philosopher kings. Yet Zender\u2019s version of Winterreise has reached out beyond the contemporary classical music scene, embracing listeners with a technique that reflects and refracts Schubert\u2019s original through a series of mirrors and kaleidoscopes, while retaining its essential identity. Zender stretches the music, interrupts it, subjects it to filmic procedures of montage and slow motion but, projected by the figure of the singer, Schubert\u2019s original vision is always implicated. This new take on Winterreise is not an avant garde assault or a confection of rebarbative modernism. Rather it is a work that offers us a conversation \u2013 and sometimes a confrontation \u2013 between the past and the present.    Related: Ian Bostridge on singing Schubert\u2019s Winterreise - an indispensable work of art    It is saturated in the sonorities of a range of music composed between 1828 (the year of Winterreise\u2019s publication) and 1996. Its version of Schuberts\u2019s song cycle allows us to experience it as strange, a strangeness Schubert\u2019s contemporaries felt and which we may have lost; but it acknowledges the fact that it has meant many different things to the generations between Schubert\u2019s and our own. As Zender puts it: \u201cOne suddenly sees the image of a beloved master multiplied two and three times, from different angles, as it were, from different perspectives.\u201d When Netia and I were looking for a project to work on after our Barbican staging of Benjamin Britten\u2019s Curlew River, Zender\u2019s Winterreise seemed an obvious choice. Like Britten\u2019s work, it is a piece in dialogue with the past. More importantly for us, it engaged with our particular interests and obsessions.  In writing a book about Schubert\u2019s Winterreise, I had wanted to do two things: to understand how this crucial work emerged from its own time and was transmitted through history to speak to us now; and to convey the piece\u2019s currently and vitality \u2013 its \u201crelevance\u201d, to use a much abused word \u2013 to readers who might never have heard it. Zender\u2019s work, which I\u2019ve performed in concert in Amsterdam and in Vienna, puts this mission into action. It connects the work to its own history; and it revitalises it for those who might have shied away from the perceived exclusivism of the Lieder recital. I maintain that Schubert\u2019s Winterreise can speak to anyone; but Zender\u2019s reading provides another way in.     Obsessive immersion... director Netia Jones. Photograph: Simon Minett/for The Guardian    Staging Zender is also an exciting prospect. The fact that it\u2019s Zender, rather than Schubert, gives us a greater freedom; or rather, underwrites our freedom as interpreters. It also, perhaps, allows us to reach a new audience, something that the venue, the Barbican, underlines. I\u2019ve always felt a connection between Hamlet, the great soliloquiser, and the protagonist of Winterreise, so to bring the work to life on a stage designed for Shakespearian purposes is apt if daunting. I played Britten\u2019s Turn of the Screw in the Barbican nearly 20 years ago, and I know its capacity for intimacy.  I shouldn\u2019t really speak for the director, Netia Jones. Even as we move into the final rehearsals, it\u2019s still a work in progress; and I\u2019m loath to give away too much. But Jones\u2019s obsessive immersion in issues of identity and loss, and her virtuosic mastery of theatrical media both new and old \u2013 gesture, light, projection \u2013 achieve a connection with Schubert\u2019s original creation of an alienated self, and Zender\u2019s relayering of that masterpiece. In Jones\u2019s vision, the performer, as Everyman, can face himself. \u2022 The Dark Mirror: Zender\u2019s Winterreise is at the Barbican theatre from 12-14 May.",
