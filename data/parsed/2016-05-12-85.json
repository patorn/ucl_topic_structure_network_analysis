Photograph: BBC News/PA    Nicola Thorp, 27, said she reported for work as a receptionist at a PwC office in central London last December wearing flat shoes, but was told she had to have a 2-4in heel. After refusing to buy a pair of heels as directed by a supervisor, she was told to go home without pay, she said. Thorp\u2019s petition, entitled Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work, was posted on Tuesday night and by Thursday afternoon had passed the 100,000 signatures needed to trigger a response by the government.  \u201cIt\u2019s still legal in the UK for a company to require female members of staff to wear high heels at work against their will,\u201d the petition states. \u201cDress code laws should be changed so that women have the option to wear flat formal shoes at work, if they wish. Current formal work dress codes are outdated and sexist.\u201d Thorp said she had been overwhelmed by the response. \u201cIt shows it is an important matter and it is a step in the right direction,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cIt has opened up a dialogue for women to talk about how they feel at work and how they\u2019re dressed.\u201d She said it meant a lot that many men had also signed the petition.           Woman made to wear heels to work: \u2018This is a women\u2019s rights issue\u2019    Portico, the agency Thorp was working for, said she had signed the appearance guidelines. But the managing director, Simon Pratt, said the company had now changed its policy. \u201cAll our female colleagues can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer,\u201d he said.
