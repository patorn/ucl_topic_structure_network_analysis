  "body": "The financial services industry based in the City of London facilitates a system that makes the UK the most corrupt nation in the world, the anti-mafia journalist Roberto Saviano said at the Hay festival.  Saviano, who has been living under armed police guard for more than 10 years after writing an expose of the Neapolitan Camorra, said London\u2019s banking institutions were key components of \u201ccriminal capitalism\u201d, which laundered drug money through the offshore networks. He said: \u201cIf I asked what is the most corrupt place on Earth, you might say it\u2019s Afghanistan, maybe Greece, Nigeria, the south of Italy. I would say it is the UK. It\u2019s not UK bureaucracy, police, or politics, but what is corrupt is the financial capital. Ninety per cent of the owners of capital in London have their headquarters offshore. \u201cJersey and the Caymans are the access gates to criminal capital in Europe and the UK is the country that allows it. That is why it is important, why it is so crucial for me to talk to you because I want to say: this is about you, this is about your life, this is about your government.\u201d As he spoke two bodyguards stood by silently scanning the crowd. In his interview on Saturday with Guardian and Observer journalist Ed Vulliamy, Saviano said that there was a hidden danger of voting to leave the European Union that was little discussed. He said if the UK left the EU, it would undermine joint attempts to fight illegal economies. \u201cLeaving the EU means allowing the Qatari societies, the Mexican cartels, the Russia Mafia to gain even more power,\u201d he said, highlighting the fact HSBC had paid $1.9bn in fines to the US government for financial irregularities in dealing with money that had come from cartels.  He added: \u201cWe have proof, we have evidence. Today, the criminal economy is bigger than the legal economy. Drug trafficking eclipses the revenue of oil firms. Cocaine is a \u00a3300bn-a-year business. Criminal capitalism is capitalism without rules. Mafia and organised crime does not abide by the rule of law \u2013 and most financial companies who reside offshore are exactly the same.\u201d Saviano also recalled how he had been moved to write the book that led to the Camorra telling him it would kill him. \u201cIn my lifetime, more than 4,000 people have been killed in Naples and the surrounding area by the Camorra,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I was younger I did not have a clear perception of the criminal power that ruled that area.\u201d He said that the murder of a priest in his home town radically changed his view.    Related: Roberto Saviano: My life under armed guard    \u201cThe priest was 30 years old and was shot in the face,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had spoken out about the Camorra. He had said \u2018for the love of my people I will not keep quiet in the face of a dictatorship run by the Mafia. He called it a totalitarian power within a democracy, and wrote an essay denouncing them. He said by doing so, he felt he could influence the power that was around me.\u201d Saviano explained how his life had changed dramatically, aged 26, when he wrote Gomorra, a book exposing the people in the Camorra and the way they acted. Saviano said: \u201cWhen I got myself into this situation and I could not imagine that it would end like this because many books have been written on the Mafia, but it was my book that made them so angry. \u201cMy life is unique. I am followed by two bulletproofed cars and by more than five officers and that brings about a feeling of guilt sometimes because you exposed yourself too much, you were not cautious enough. I live under police protection and have done so for 10 years. What got me into trouble wasn\u2019t so much that I wrote a book, but the way I wrote it. I named names and I stated facts. I took you to the crime scene.\u201d Vulliamy praised his bravery and Saviano replied by saying writers should cherish their ability to speak out. \u201cNever take for granted the freedom of expression,\u201d Saviano said. He cited the case of Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban aged 15 for campaigning for the right for girls to education. \u201cThey are the world\u2019s biggest heroin traffickers, who make fortunes from the trade, and they were frightened of this 15-year-old who was brave enough to speak up for women and girls to go to school as a way to transform her society,\u201d he said. He added he had been influenced by fellow Italian writer Primo Levi, whose book If This Is a Man about life in Auschwitz laid bare the daily horrors of life in the Nazi death camp.  \u201cHe brought the reader to Auschwitz,\u201d explained Saviano. \u201cI wanted to say to the reader, this story is about you \u2013 that way the reader becomes a problem for organised crime.\u201d",
