The Labour leader made the comments during a speech at an event on Saturday for supporters from Momentum, after a week in which there were a number of reports Labour MPs were considering mounting a challenge to his leadership after the local elections. Speaking at the Momentum Latino launch, he said: \u201cWe have a party under attack from much of the media in this country like it has never been under attack before. How do we reach out to people? We reach out because we come together at events like this. We reach out through social media in a massive way. And so I find that social media has a very important role to play in this. \u201cWhen in one week, we can get one to 2 million people watching online a message we have been able to deliver at maybe a meeting like this or perhaps one that is even bigger somewhere else. It is a way of reaching past the censorship of the rightwing media in this country that has so constrained political debate for so long.  \u201cAnd so we begin to reframe political debate. I\u2019ll tell you this: some of the more traditional media in this country find it very hard to understand, when they frame all political debate around rumours that abound in the Palace of Westminster and the discussion that takes place between journalists who have very much the same ideas, same outlook, same backgrounds and same attitudes towards society. We are doing things very differently.\u201d Two of Corbyn\u2019s allies, Diane Abbott, a shadow cabinet minister, and Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, have also accused the media of whipping up complaints about a small number of cases of antisemitism into a crisis that led to the party launching an inquiry. Corbyn made the comments before the launch of a campaign poster on Tuesday with the slogan: \u201cElections are about taking sides. Labour is on yours.\u201d During the event, he predicted Labour would not lose seats in this week\u2019s local elections and dismissed rumours of a leadership coup, suggesting they have been created by the \u201cgolden circle\u201d of the media. Despite the analysis of a leading academic suggesting Labour could be on course for its worst results in 35 years, Corbyn said his party was \u201cnot going to lose seats; we are looking to gain seats where we can\u201d in the elections for local councils, regional assemblies and mayoralties. Asked whether he would stand again if he faced a challenge from a fellow MP, Corbyn said he was going nowhere and \u201cof course\u201d he would. But he dismissed the talk of a coup, telling reporters that the media had become obsessed with his leadership, instead of writing about \u201cgrotesque levels of inequality\u201d and what people were talking about on the street. \u201cI don\u2019t know who these Labour MPs are but I would advise every member of the party to get out there and campaign. We have two days to go,\u201d he said. Corbyn said later: \u201cWhen I talk to people on the streets \u2026 they are talking about housing, poverty, cuts, zero-hour contracts, low wages, the crisis of expectations among young people. \u201cIt\u2019s time that many of the media, the golden circle of the media establishment, actually got out and talked to people. Many people are obsessed with this [the Labour leadership] instead of rather than what they should be obsessed with: the devastating crisis of inequality in our country.\u201d Polling of Labour party members suggests Corbyn has retained the overwhelming backing of those who elected him in a landslide victory last autumn. Any candidate with serious ambitions to lead the party would risk a crushing defeat at the hands of the grassroots members. However, it is possible a less serious \u201cstalking horse\u201d candidate could put themself forward to smoke out the scale of opposition to Corbyn.           Jeremy Corbyn: media are obsessed with my leadership    Possible triggers for a challenge could include poor council and assembly results, a defeat for Sadiq Khan in the London mayoral election, or even attempts by the leadership to save the career of Ken Livingstone, who was suspended for controversial comments about Hitler and Zionism last week. Livingstone and Len McCluskey, the Unite union leader, are among those on the left to have warned that some MPs on the right of the party are using allegations of a crisis about antisemitism within Labour to destabilise the leadership and clear the way for a challenge. Speaking in Southwark, Corbyn said allegations about antisemitism within Labour had been \u201cdealt with\u201d now that an independent inquiry by Shami Chakrabarti had been launched and a small number of members had been suspended.",
