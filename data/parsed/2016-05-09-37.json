  "body": "The education secretary, Nicky Morgan, was accused by Labour of presiding over \u201ca chaotic mess\u201d when she appeared before MPs on Monday to explain her government\u2019s U-turn over controversial plans to force schools to become academies.   Related: Despite Nicky Morgan\u2019s U-turn, our schools are still\u00a0in a mess | Melissa Benn    In a statement to the Commons, Morgan insisted the government\u2019s goal had not changed and she still wanted every school to become an academy, but acknowledged concerns about a \u201chard deadline\u201d for all schools to convert by 2022. Instead of \u201cblanket\u201d conversion, she told MPs there would be new powers to enable the Department for Education to step in and force schools in \u201cunderperforming\u201d local authorities \u2013 or those unable to provide the necessary support \u2013 to convert to academy status.  She said the threshold which would define \u201cunderperforming\u201d would be the subject of an \u201caffirmative resolution\u201d which would be put before the Commons for consultation. Her statement followed the announcement on Friday that plans to force through the academisation policy by 2022 would not now be included in the forthcoming Queen\u2019s speech, following opposition from Conservative-led local authorities among many others. Responding to the statement, the shadow education secretary, Lucy Powell, accused Morgan of causing further confusion: \u201cShe says her aim remains the same, but without the means. However she wants to dress it up, dropping her desire to force all schools to become academies by her arbitrary deadline of 2022 is a key concession. \u201cSchool leaders should take it as a very clear signal that the foot is off their throat and they shouldn\u2019t feel they need to jump before being pushed. \u201cThe secretary of state is presiding over a chaotic mess dragging schools backwards and her ambitions for further structural change are, at best, a distraction and, at worst, will damage standards.\u201d She said there was no evidence that academisation was the panacea for school improvement and quoted data, published in the Times on Monday, which revealed a sharp disparity in standards between academy chains. \u201cAnalysis published today by PWC shows that only three of the biggest academy chains gets a positive value-added rating,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just one of the 26 biggest primary sponsors achieves results above the national average.\u201d Many Tory backbenchers stood up in the Commons to thank the education secretary for listening to their concerns, suggesting the potential rebellion was widespread within the Tory party.   Related: \u2018If they close small schools, villages will be museums\u2019    Morgan, who remained defiant throughout her appearance despite the climbdown, insisted that a record 227 schools voluntarily applied for academy status in March, with more than 100 conversion orders issued to underperforming schools since then. \u201cOur goal has not changed,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be no retreat from giving every child the best start in life.\u201d  She refused to back down on another controversial strand of her education white paper: plans to scrap compulsory parent governor seats on school governing bodies. She said it was \u201cnot the only way for parents to be involved\u201d. She also sought to assuage fears about the survival of rural schools, insisting they would be protected by a dual lock, whereby national and local government would both have to agree to any planned closure. Morgan told schools they would not be forced to join multi-academy trusts, as had been feared, but said she expected most schools to join local clusters.",
