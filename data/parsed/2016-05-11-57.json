  "body": "Jordan Spieth does not attempt to hide the scale of his post-Masters trauma. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that upon any of you,\u201d the Texan said at Sawgrass on Wednesday, as he glanced back to an Augusta scene where he not only stumbled when a successful title defence was in his grasp, but also went through the painful ritual of handing the Green Jacket to Danny Willett. Spieth\u2019s pain contrasted starkly with Willett\u2019s delight at a maiden major triumph.   Related: Danny Willett back after only one round of golf since Masters triumph    \u201cI know the feelings that Danny was experiencing,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI was obviously very happy for him and he 100% earned his Masters win. It really bugs me when people are trying to take that maybe away from him or shoot it down. The questions have been asked to him: \u2018Do you think this will go down as you winning or him losing?\u2019 And that\u2019s absolute bull, because he won and he earned it. \u201cI knew the shots he played down the stretch. I heard the roars. I knew the putts that he made. But for me personally, it was certainly difficult to go through that experience right afterwards, feeling like I had control of it and could have very well put the jacket on myself, or however it works. I don\u2019t really know how it works, I was hoping to find out.\u201d The Players Championship this week marks Spieth\u2019s first start since the wounding emotions of a month ago in Georgia. The pre-event talk here, inevitably, was dominated by what came before. \u201cI think people have moved on already, at least I thought so until I came in here today,\u201d Spieth said with a laugh after 20 minutes of single-topic questioning. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the game. There\u2019s a lot of people who were very happy the way it turned out, people that are fans of Danny, close to him. Again, he earned it.\u201d Spieth, 22, is adamant that nobody need feel sorry for him. He is a two\u2011times major champion and one of the finest golfers in the world. He will inevitably sample more glory before too long. Still, only those of brick heart would not have been sympathetic upon glancing at the Texan\u2019s obvious Masters dejection. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have anything to prove. I think I\u2019ve already proven what we\u2019re capable of doing when the pressure is on. We\u2019ve succeeded and been able to succeed in close matches, close finishes. We\u2019ve succeeded to stretch leads out and win by four to eight shots against some of the best fields in the world. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019ll come up where I feel like I need to get revenge.\u201d He therefore bats away any notion that issues of the mind were the most pertinent at Augusta\u2019s 12th hole, where he made a quadruple-bogey seven to the astonishment of the watching world. \u201cI have put it behind me. I\u2019m not affected by it. If I work into contention again, I imagine those thoughts won\u2019t come up because it was just one bad hole with bad timing. I played the golf course the rest of that day extremely well. What happened? Well, I had mentioned throughout the week that I was not striking the ball very well. I didn\u2019t say that after Sunday\u2019s round, this was something I was mentioning from Thursday on. I was just getting around that golf course the right way. \u201cMy miss, given where my club was positioned, was short and right. That\u2019s OK at Augusta on almost every other hole; 12 and 13 it doesn\u2019t really work well. But just about everywhere else, it\u2019s fine. \u201cThat kind of mistake could have very well happened any other day. It wasn\u2019t like the moment was what caused it because I had been in that moment many times already and succeeded, and I\u2019ve had failures, and both are going to come. It was the wrong miss, so what do we do? We go to the drawing board and figure out how to get my swing to the consistent level it was at during really the second half of last year was when I struck the ball the best.\u201d Spieth aside, a terrific Sawgrass field includes the likes of Willett, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Bubba Watson. Rickie Fowler is the defending champion. McIlroy\u2019s 2016 to date has included some exhilarating spells of golf and consistent top-10 finishes but, to his frustration, no wins. The Northern Irishman\u2019s explanation for that is simple. \u201cThere\u2019s just been too many mistakes in there, too many lost shots, too many soft bogeys,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if anything, I just need to tidy that up because I know I\u2019m playing well enough to make the birdies and to post a lot of red numbers. I just need to tidy up everything else. Results-wise, it isn\u2019t what I had hoped for.\u201d",
