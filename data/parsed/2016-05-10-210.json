  "body": "The humiliating trial of Sumner Redstone is far from over. Just hours after Manuela Herzer, the billionaire media mogul\u2019s former lover, had her claims against his mental competency thrown out of court, Herzer filed a lawsuit against Redstone\u2019s daughter. Herzer, Redstone\u2019s companion for six years, filed a second suit against several members of Redstone\u2019s household in California on Monday, attacking his daughter Shari, the primary defendant in the new filing, and other \u201chenchmen\u201d. The new case was filed the same day Herzer appealed against Judge David J Cowan\u2019s original ruling. \u201cWe are disappointed that the court terminated the case after one day and did not allow us to put on all of our substantial evidence of Redstone\u2019s mental incompetency and decisions that he made because of lies about my client, manipulation, and undue influence,\u201d wrote Herzer\u2019s attorney Pierce O\u2019Donnell. The filings came as voicemails left by Sumner Redstone, now 92, appeared online, describing in lurid detail the nature of planned sexual trysts.  The news is merely the latest in a series of embarrassments for the man who almost single-handedly fashioned one of the world\u2019s largest media empires and a fortune estimated at some $5.2bn by Forbes. The ongoing suit comes amid calls from investors to remove his handpicked executives from leadership at Viacom. In February, Redstone stepped down as chairman of both companies following an examination by a psychiatrist as part of the recently dismissed case.   Related: Sumner Redstone resigns as executive chairman of Viacom    Redstone, head of National Amusements, still owns controlling voting shares in both Viacom and CBS, media properties responsible for huge incomes across cable, broadcast, premium pay-TV networks and film. Among the assets he controls are Paramount Pictures and Comedy Central, home of South Park and Inside Amy Schumer. Herzer\u2019s previous suit had claimed Redstone was \u201ca living ghost\u201d, unable to manage his affairs, and his agents had squeezed Herzer out of her fair share of his fortune. But in explosive video testimony on Friday, Sumner effectively ended her case. While the mogul clearly had difficulty expressing himself, he made his feelings crystal clear: \u201cShe is \u2013 Manuela is a fucking bitch,\u201d he said. The new suit against Shari Redstone is much more straightforwardly about money. \u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Shari and her henchmen responsible for their criminal acts in intentionally destroying Herzer\u2019s special relationship with Sumner and causing Sumner to disinherit her, thereby losing her $70 million inheritance,\u201d her attorneys wrote, citing what they called \u201ca successful campaign to turn Sumner against Herzer\u201d. The younger Redstone\u2019s distaste for Herzer is well documented. With another ex-girlfriend, Sydney Holland, Herzer attended Redstone beginning in 2009; Shari Redstone told the Hollywood reporter in February that it was Herzer and Holland who restricted Redstone\u2019s access to her father, not the other way around. \u201cOnce Ms Herzer was out of my father\u2019s life, my family and I were able to reunite with my father,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I am able to visit with my father on a regular basis. \u201c[M]y family was effectively prevented from having meaningful access to my father.\u201d",
