  "body": "The shadowy Whitehall unit at the heart of the British government\u2019s covert strategic communications campaign was inspired by a clandestine cold war propaganda programme. But while the cold war offensive targeted communism, trade unionists and newspapers in developing countries, the current operations are aimed at Muslims, both in Britain and the Middle East. The British-based element of the campaign is part of the Prevent counter-radicalisation programme and is run by the Home Office\u2019s Research, Information and Communications Unit, or Ricu.   Related: Revealed: UK's covert propaganda bid to stop Muslims joining Isis    Ricu officials dislike the word propaganda: they prefer the term strategic communications. The extraordinary ambitions of these communications are set out in Ricu documents seen by the Guardian. \u201cStrategic communications aims to effect behavioural and attitudinal change,\u201d says one paper. For almost two years Ricu\u2019s focus has been on Islamic State, whose own online propaganda has proven powerful. Isis is calculated to be posting an average of 18 messages a day, many of them showing not violence, but flowers, forests and flowing streams, to emphasise the natural beauty of the territory under its control. To counter this, Ricu says privately that it is working \u201cat an industrial scale and pace\u201d. While it does produce some government-branded communications, the key to its counter-radicalisation messages is that they are disseminated through \u201cdiscreet campaigns supported by Ricu without any acknowledgment of UK government support\u201d. It uses YouTube, Twitter and Facebook as well as more traditional propaganda methods, such as feeding stories to newspapers, including the Guardian, and leafleting. Under the umbrella of Prevent Ricu is based in the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT), in the Home Office\u2019s Westminster HQ. Charles Farr, a former MI6 officer and head of the OSCT, set up the unit shortly after arriving at the Home Office in 2007. Ricu was modelled on the Information Research Department (IRD), a propaganda unit established in 1948 by the Attlee government. The IRD\u2019s exploits included hoodwinking journalists and academics and targeting trade unionists, before it was shut down in 1977.     Charles Farr gives evidence to the home affairs select committee. Photograph: PA    Farr told MPs that the new unit had two functions: advising officials \u201cfrom a brigade commander in Helmand province through to a chief constable in Yorkshire\u201d on the language they should use to describe terrorism and the government\u2019s response; and challenging the propaganda of al-Qaida and others. Some of the unit\u2019s funding came from the budget for Prevent, the controversial counter-radicalisation programme. This funding has risen steeply: for 2015-16, the unit\u2019s budget was \u00a317m, more than five times as much as three years earlier. Ricu has hired linguists, psychologists and anthropologists as well as counter-terrorism strategists, digital media experts, film-makers and marketing consultants. It has three divisions: a monitoring and coordination team to watch and study digital and traditional media; an insight and analysis team to research audience reactions; and a domestic and international campaigns team to deliver the covert propaganda. When the Home Office revised Prevent in June 2011, it declared that Ricu\u2019s impact had been \u201cvariable\u201d, and that more effort to \u201cidentify credible partners\u201d and develop powerful narratives and \u201cmore professional counter-narrative products\u201d was needed. The following January, the home secretary, Theresa May, informed the intelligence and security committee that Ricu was \u201croad-testing some quite innovative approaches to counter-ideological messages\u201d. By the end of the year, the unit had a new head, Richard Chalk. A former Conservative parliamentary candidate and communications chief, Chalk arrived after working in Baghdad for Bell Pottinger, the British PR firm. That work \u2013 some of which remains classified \u2013 included \u201cinformation operations\u201d intended to help undermine the insurgency. On his return to the UK he became chief of staff for the then Tory party co-chair, Sayeeda Warsi. The Home Office says he was hired to head Ricu because of his expertise in counter-terrorism strategic communications. Under Chalk\u2019s leadership, Ricu began communicating with British Muslims in a manner more reminiscent of counter-insurgency operations than a traditional public information campaign: disseminating messages through the use of subterfuge. Delivering the propaganda Much of the work is outsourced. Ricu\u2019s favoured contractor is Breakthrough Media Network Ltd, a company operating from an anonymous office block near Waterloo station in central London. Nothing inside, other than a series of locked doors and CCTV cameras, suggests the nature of the company\u2019s work. Like Chalk, one of Breakthrough\u2019s two directors, Scott Brown, worked for the Conservatives before joining Bell Pottinger\u2019s information operations team in Baghdad. The other, Robert Elliott, is a former reality TV producer. Both are in their 30s and attended the same school in Essex. Working under contract to Ricu, Breakthrough produces masses of digital material \u2013 films, Twitter feeds, Facebook profiles, YouTube clips, online radio content and websites. It says these are often \u201chosted\u201d by Muslim civil society groups. One Breakthrough document seen by the Guardian explains that its objective is to \u201cinfluence online conversations by being embedded within target communities via a network of moderate organisations that are supportive of it\u2019s [sic] goals\u201d. While at least one entity Ricu has used to disseminate its messages \u2013 Help for Syria \u2013 has been designed for a specific counter-radicalisation message by Breakthrough, it usually works with groups that already exist. One person familiar with Ricu\u2019s work says that such groups are monitored closely before any approach is made. Sometimes, the source added, they are very small. \u201cIt could be just some guy with a blog, but it was always someone HMG [Her Majesty\u2019s government] could work with. It\u2019s not a genuine partnership, however: it\u2019s a manipulative arrangement.\u201d Ricu does not fund these groups, instead funding Breakthrough\u2019s work to produce these groups\u2019 communications. Some of the groups with which Breakthrough works on Ricu\u2019s behalf insist they retain editorial control and that Ricu and Breakthrough\u2019s help amplifies their messages. Privately, however, Breakthrough says it is providing \u201cRicu with effective ways of communicating its own messages through credible civil society organisations\u201d.

Photograph: AP    Ricu\u2019s briefing notes are even clearer about who is in charge: \u201cWhilst retaining editorial control over all Ricu-produced material, Ricu provides a range of support and expertise to CSOs [civil society organisations] to help them shape campaigns, produce products and mobilise their stakeholders.\u201d As of February last year, according to one document, the unit had run 13 national campaigns, producing a total of 950 physical and online products, which had been accessed by audiences more than a million times. Chalk is an occasional visitor to Breakthrough\u2019s offices. One source said: \u201cSometimes he sits in the edit suites, watching the work. It\u2019s not exactly scripted by Ricu, but they\u2019ll make it clear that they want a particular form of words to be used at a particular point in a film.\u201d A Breakthrough source said that as the government was paying for the contract, Ricu was within its rights to visit the edit suite to check the quality of the work. Ricu and Breakthrough focus on \u201cPrevent priority areas\u201d in the UK, using keywords and paid-for Google and Facebook adverts to target people whose browsing history suggests they are Muslims. Using so-called \u201cpromotion and diversion techniques\u201d, Breakthrough promotes Ricu\u2019s messages to browsers who are searching for terms such as Isis, Khalifa and \u201cWhat does the Qur\u2019an say about jihad?\u201d. Last year, Breakthrough set up a public relations company, Horizon PR, as a joint enterprise with M&C Saatchi. \u201cHorizon was created to support the public relations of civil society groups, voluntary organisations and NGOs [non-governmental organisations] who want to drive positive social change,\u201d a Saatchi spokesman said. Horizon has promoted the work of community groups as part of Breakthrough\u2019s contract with Ricu. Journalists contacted by Horizon have not been told that the company was representing the groups as part of the Ricu contract. Breakthrough is understood to say that there was no obligation to disclose the government\u2019s involvement. Breakthrough says in one document that it \u201cunderstands the sensitive nature of Ricu\u2019s work and adheres to the highest standards of security and confidentiality\u201d. Were Ricu\u2019s involvement to be exposed, there would be a negative impact not only on the credibility of the messages, but on \u201cRicu, Prevent and the Home Office\u2019s reputation\u201d. The purpose of this work, Breakthrough makes clear, is to help the British government \u201cpromote a reconciled British Muslim identity\u201d while keeping its involvement hidden, as \u201cany content or messaging attributed to the state are highly unlikely to have any credibility among these audiences\u201d. To achieve the government\u2019s aim, Ricu is attempting to change the way young British Muslims think and act: time and again the documents talk about \u201cimplementing attitudinal and behavioural change communications\u201d; \u201cmeasurable attitudinal change outcomes\u201d; and \u201ccampaigns designed to deliver real attitudinal and behavioural change\u201d. \u2018They\u2019re not what they seem\u2019 Breakthrough has contracts with several non-governmental bodies and has been transparent about governmental support for communications campaigns in east Africa. But several sources say its work for Ricu dwarfs its other operations. Breakthrough\u2019s relationship with the unit is lucrative. In 2012-13, the firm received \u00a3448,286 from its contracts with the OSCT. By 2013-14, this had increased to \u00a35,911,719. In total, the company has earned \u00a311.8m from the OSCT since 2012.     Theresa May, the home secretary. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters    One person with knowledge of Ricu\u2019s work said some freelancers working with Breakthrough do not appear to know they are engaged in covert propaganda. Several former Breakthrough employees, both freelance and staff, told the Guardian they had not heard of Ricu \u2013 a suggestion Breakthrough is understood to contest. One former employee said she left after realising she was working on propaganda because she considered the work to be \u201cstupid and reprehensible\u201d. Another, a freelance, said she realised the connection after Breakthrough managers repeatedly requested editing changes. \u201cIt became obvious that it was being directed from outside the company. It was a slightly more shadowy process. I asked where the money was coming from and they said the Home Office. I was uneasy enough to get out. They are not what they seem.\u201d The Home Office refused to answer questions about Ricu\u2019s work and would not permit anyone from the unit to be interviewed. It would not comment on the extent of the home secretary\u2019s oversight of Ricu; nor would it respond to suggestions that its covert support for Muslim organisations risks undermining support from Muslim civil society as a whole. It issued a statement, however, saying it was working with communities, civil society groups and individuals to counter the \u201ctwisted narrative\u201d of terrorists and extremists. \u201cWe are proud of the support Ricu has provided to organisations working on the frontline to challenge the warped ideology of groups such as Daesh [Isis], and to protect communities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis work can involve sensitive issues, vulnerable communities and hard-to-reach audiences, and it has been important to build relationships out of the media glare. We respect the bravery of individuals and organisations who choose to speak out against violence and extremism and it is right that we support and protect them. \u201cOur guiding principle has to be whether or not any organisation we work with is itself happy to talk publicly about what they do. At the same time we are as open as we can be and have referenced the role of Ricu in publications and in parliament.\u201d Unlike Ricu, Breakthrough did provide answers to the Guardian\u2019s questions but said it regarded those answers as confidential and not for publication. In a statement, it said: \u201cBreakthrough Media is enormously proud to be able to provide a wide range of community groups with the help and support they need to tell their stories, confront extremism in all its forms and build stronger, safer communities.\u201d Officials who are familiar with the work told the Guardian that it was a good and valuable effort. One person involved acknowledged that the work amounted to propaganda but added: \u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do is stop people becoming suicide bombers.\u201d  Reporting team: Ian Cobain, Alice Ross, Rob Evans, Mona Mahmood, Nick Fielding and Safak Timur",
