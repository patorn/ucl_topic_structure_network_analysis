  "body": "In the first debate of the election campaign, 100 voters declared Bill Shorten the winner over Malcolm Turnbull by 42 votes to 29, with 29 undecided after both flagged new measures on health spending. Turnbull confirmed the health minister, Sussan Ley, had brokered a compromise deal with Pathology Australia over the government\u2019s planned cuts to the bulk-billing incentive. The pathology industry was gearing up for a major campaign against the Coalition due to the planned measures. The brokered deal would see the Coalition limit costs regarding pathology property rents in return for government maintaining cuts to the bulk-billing incentives.  In another new development, Shorten hinted Labor may not maintain the Medicare funding freeze, originally announced by the Labor government in 2013 but then later picked up by the Coalition and extended in the latest budget.  The debate was held in the Windsor RSL, which is in the marginal seat of Macquarie west of Sydney, currently held by the Liberals MP Louise Markus on a 4.5% margin. It capped the first full week of campaigning for the two leaders. Voters asked questions about childcare, education, privatisation, government debt and bank interest rates. No one asked about climate change, same-sex marriage, asylum seeker policy or the small business tax cuts.  Turnbull appealed to voters to endorse his \u201ceconomic plan\u201d which he promised would focus on growth while Shorten pitched his \u201cpositive policies\u201d centred more on education and health while dumping the Coalition plans for corporate tax cuts. An audience of 100 people selected by Galaxy Research was allowed to ask unscripted questions of the leaders after their opening pitches. The debate capped off the first full week of campaigning.  Turnbull won the toss to speak first and his pitch began with his now familiar innovation agenda, tax cuts to drive growth and his plan to address the issue of youth unemployment. \u201cIt is vital that all our spending is fully funded,\u201d Turnbull said. Shorten led with Labor\u2019s plans for \u201cquality education that doesn\u2019t depend on the wealth of their parents\u201d and he described Medicare as the \u201cgreat Australian standard\u201d of how Australians view themselves as a community. \u201cIf this country and this government put people first then nothing can hold us back in the future,\u201d Shorten said. The first questioner asked about the outsourcing of jobs offshore and asked the leaders how they would attract companies to Australia to provide jobs in Australia. Turnbull outlined his tax cuts for business while Shorten reminded the audience that the car industry had \u201cdisappeared\u201d under the Coalition. He said Labor had fought hard to ensure the submarines were built in Australia. Bob from Windsor said at 67, he was still paying tax but he was concerned at the complicated accounting that allowed multinational companies to avoid tax through transfer pricing.  Shorten claimed credit for pushing the government to move on multinational tax, given Labor released their policy well before the government acted on the issue. But he appeared less confident to outline how the policy worked. Turnbull outlined his diverted profits tax policy released in the latest budget - also known as the Google tax - which forces companies pay a higher rate of tax if they are found to avoid Australian tax. \u201cWe now have toughest laws that deal with multinational tax avoidance of any OECD country,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cPaying tax is not optional.\u201d Asked about the Medicare rebate freeze, Shorten said Labor opposed the original concept of a GP copayment. \u201cIf you make it harder to go to the doctor, they just get sicker and it costs more.\u201d Both Turnbull and Shorten committed not to privatise Australia Post. Turnbull attacked Shorten on Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy, saying \u201cpeople who understand the property market and those with common sense\u201d would know limiting negative gearing will lower prices and \u201cjack up rents\u201d. But Shorten said Labor had seen support for acting on negative gearing from the Reserve Bank, former treasurer Joe Hockey and former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett. A young mother told the leaders she wanted to go back to work with two small children but after she paid $45,000 a year in childcare, she would be paid $2 an hour \u2013 in a \u201creasonably well paid job for the area\u201d. Shorten hinted while Labor had yet to release his childcare policy, Labor would do something for people earning between $60,000 and $80,000.  Turnbull said the Coalition would look at more support in childcare if the government could get the policy through the senate.  Asked about education \u2013 a key policy for Labor \u2013 Turnbull asked the audience not to focus on who spends the most money, but which party had the best program.  It is expected there could be another two more debates through the eight-week campaign though neither leader has confirmed.",
