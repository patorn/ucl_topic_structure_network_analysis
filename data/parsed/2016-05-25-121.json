  "body": "As Channel 4 prepares to broadcast a programme created from the undercover filming in Birmingham by an interim agency social worker, we might expect it will do nothing to enhance the public perceptions of the city council nor of social workers. Nor will it promote more stable, safer and stronger services for children and families in the city. Indeed it may have helped drive children\u2019s social work services outside the delivery and control of the city council.  The council itself for many years had been its own worst enemy, presiding over frequent churn and change among senior children\u2019s service managers. It was then wounded, weakened and worsened when it was undermined by Ofsted. And it has now been coerced, if not explicitly publicly forced, to lose control of its children\u2019s social services by a government on a mission to remove statutory social work services, such as child protection investigations and decisions whether to seek court orders to remove children from families, from local authorities and direct public service provision.     We have to wait to see what the programme makers deliver from what they have been fed by the undercover social worker.    The political agenda of the government in England is to place these responsibilities and services within a market place which is being opened up to the commercial sector. Well-known outsourcing companies such as Virgin Care and Amey have already engaged in meetings with the Department for Education. But in Birmingham, a platform to generate progress and performance was being created within the city council, with this recognised by Lord Warner, previously appointed by the government to be its independent adviser on Birmingham, in an interview on Tuesday. There was every prospect of the current wise and experienced senior managers breaking out of the city\u2019s cycle of disruption.  However, Birmingham is to be churned up and set back again. The time and attention that should have been given to creating stability and service improvement will instead be deployed to set up the complex new organisational and governance arrangements of an independent trust, with more complicated, confused and costly accountability for crucial statutory responsibilities to help families and to protect children. And this change is welcomed by a local Labour MP. Indeed Labour seems accepting and acquiescent with what is being demanded by the government in Birmingham and nationally. And what of the Channel 4 programme? Unlike the balanced three-part BBC television series Protecting Our Children shown in 2012 about social work and child protection, with open access for over a year being given in Bristol to the programme makers, it is quite possible that the secretly (and inevitably slyly) filmed Channel 4 programme will concentrate on a presentation of poor and controversial practice and disillusioned workers.  This may not be so, and that what is presented will have balance and show what is good and going well alongside what is not good. We have to wait to see what the programme makers deliver from what they have been fed by the undercover social worker.  But Birmingham is far from alone in having to deal with the difficulties of recruiting and retaining an experienced workforce in the context of increasing demand amid public sector cuts. This is the national context for children\u2019s social services. Will this Dispatches programme give this national context? It is a context of more families experiencing greater poverty and difficulties, less help for families with children\u2019s centres and other services being cut, and with this in part generating an 80% increase in child protection workloads for councils at the same time that they are in the midst of a 40% reduction in government funding. Maybe the programme will be presented as an exercise in whistleblowing, as with the shocking exposure through undercover filming of the dreadful abuse of disabled people at Winterbourne View. That documentary was clearly justified and its impact important, necessary and constructive. But there are also dangers with an exercise \u2013 if this was the intention \u2013 of making a programme to present to the public a shocking story of professional and organisational failures and unacceptable behaviour.    Related: Birmingham children's services to be run by trust following failures    First there is the potential to encourage and entice comments that will feed the storyline. It would be surprising if the programme in production did not have a brief and if that brief was not given to the undercover social worker doing the filming. Second it can be exploitative with trust and friendship misused by creating the context where off-hand and unguarded comments are made which were never for a wider audience. What should be a safe space to offload, have cathartic moments, and perhaps be distressed and angry alongside colleagues amid stressful and emotionally challenging and confronting work is suddenly found to have been the territory for secret filming which is personally undermining and threatening. No amount of pixellation or shadowed faces will leave those filmed unrecognised, be they service users, colleagues, managers or partners in other agencies.  Thirdly, what is filmed will be many times much more than what is shown in the programme. There will have been much selection and editing to create a coherent programme and storyline. What is shown is likely to support the intention of the programme makers. Unlike the BBC series, it may not be wise to expect that it will be seen as fair and balanced by those working in Birmingham or indeed elsewhere. Whistleblowing about poor practice and poor organisations should be encouraged and promoted. But there is also the danger of losing fairness and balance and leaving good people doing difficult jobs bruised and battered and feeling let down by a trusted colleague.  It remains to be seen what is delivered by Channel 4. I hope these fears are unfounded. But it may already be that this programme \u2013 even before being broadcast \u2013 has contributed to the delivery of a national political agenda and delayed and undermined the improvements which Birmingham needed to make.
