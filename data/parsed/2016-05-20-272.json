  "body": "When the Gorbals hard man sat down in Barlinnie jail in 1976 and wrote the story of his life, he can little have imagined that it would become a bestseller, a film and, 40 years later, be reprinted as a classic of prison literature. Even less could he have dreamed that, by then, he would be a\u00a0world-renowned sculptor living between Marrakech and the French Riviera with his actor wife, having moved from his home in Edinburgh 15\u00a0years earlier, not least to avoid being forever known as \u201cScotland\u2019s most violent criminal\u201d and to escape an unforgiving Scottish tabloid press that seemed to resent his success. Yet that is what happened to Jimmy Boyle. When it was first published, A\u00a0Sense of Freedom cost 80p and its cover promised \u201cthe most controversial social document since Cathy Come Home\u201d. While the latter was Ken Loach\u2019s indictment of homelessness in Britain in the 1960s, Boyle\u2019s book, knocked out on an old Olivetti in six weeks, threw open the barred doors of the nation\u2019s prisons in all their baleful brutality. Now Ebury Press has republished it with a\u00a0foreword by another rebellious Scot, Irvine Welsh, and a rueful afterword by\u00a0Boyle himself. It is hard to overestimate the impact that his book had when it was first published. At the time, Boyle was serving a\u00a0life sentence for the murder of a fellow Scottish gangster, Babs Rooney, a crime he always denied. What he did not deny was that he had been a\u00a0violent and sometimes ruthless moneylender from the roughest of backgrounds in Glasgow. It was Boyle\u2019s refusal to conform in prison that stood at the hard centre of the book. He covered himself in excrement to avoid being beaten up by prison guards, and fought what seemed like an unending battle with authority. Redemption came in the shape of the special unit in Barlinnie, where some of Scotland\u2019s most recalcitrant prisoners were given a measure of autonomy and, crucially as far as Boyle was concerned, presented with a chance to\u00a0learn about art. He was released in 1980, married Sarah Trevelyan, a psychiatrist who had visited him in prison by way of a mutual friend \u2013 not as Boyle\u2019s psychiatrist, as\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0often wrongly suggested \u2013 and with whom he has two children, Suzi and Kydd. They settled in Edinburgh where he and Sarah set up the Gateway Exchange, a project aimed at helping to\u00a0keep vulnerable young people off\u00a0drugs. They parted company in 2000 having drifted apart. In the afterword to the new edition he writes of the \u201cutter despair\u201d he felt at the ending of\u00a0their relationship: \u201cNo\u00a0one was to blame. We\u00a0just took two different paths without realising it, until it hit us.\u201d In the original version of the book, published jointly by Canongate and Pan, Boyle writes of having an argument with Rooney and of slashing him in the chest. There is an enigmatic footnote: \u201cI\u00a0haven\u2019t been as forthcoming with the circumstances of Babs Rooney\u2019s death as I have been on earlier incidents in the book. The reason for this is that, although I maintain I never killed him,\u00a0I did slash him, therefore by law I\u00a0am technically guilty of his murder \u2026 I am now familiar with all the facts leading to his death and what happened but I\u00a0don\u2019t feel they have anything to do with this story. So\u00a0rather than create problems for someone else I\u00a0have just given the details as I knew them then and my own part in it.\u201d The afterword of the new edition clarifies matters: \u201cThe truth is Babs Rooney \u2026 was killed by my co-accused William Wilson. The whole dynamics of this sum up the world where I once lived. I\u00a0kept strictly to the \u2018no grassing\u2019 rule. I\u00a0put myself away for 15 years for\u00a0the gangster badge of honour that I\u00a0wasn\u2019t a grass.\u201d Wilson\u2019s advocate, the late Nicholas Fairbairn QC, even told Wilson during the trial that he should count himself lucky that he was in the dock alongside the notorious Boyle.

Photograph: Jeff Morris/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock    \u201cThe deal was that whichever of us got off would say \u2018It was me that did it\u2019 \u2013 in those days, thanks to double jeopardy you could not be tried twice for the same crime \u2013 but no one listened to him,\u201d says Boyle, back at his home in\u00a0Antibes. \u201cIt was the name of the game and we didn\u2019t fall out over it\u00a0at all. I\u00a0never even thought about it.\u201d Wilson is dead now, no longer at risk of\u00a0any earthly judgment. But given his desire to escape his past, why has Boyle decided to republish the book? \u201cI\u2019ve been the invisible man, but the publishers, Ebury Press, contacted my daughter, Suzi, and got in touch that way. It was quite a painful experience to go through the book again. To be honest, I still don\u2019t know if\u00a0it was the right decision, but it came at the time that they were stopping books from going into prison [the controversial decision by the former justice secretary, Chris Grayling, to restrict prisoners\u2019 access to books, which caused national outrage and was\u00a0eventually overturned in court]. It\u00a0really angered me \u2013 I would be dead now without books. It struck me as something worse than the old Soviet Union would have done, and that tipped me over the edge.\u201d    They\u2019ve totally given up on prisons. I hope the book might be part of a\u00a0debate about what has gone wrong    Other people\u2019s books featured heavily in his life inside. There was, perhaps inevitably, Dostoevsky\u2019s Crime and Punishment and some Dickens and Victor Hugo. Then, as his fascination with art began, he turned to Giacometti. He is dismayed by what has happened to the penal systems on both sides of the border. \u201cThey\u2019ve totally given up on prisons. There are drugs everywhere. They\u2019re spending a\u00a0fortune and achieving nothing. I suppose I would hope that the book might just be part of a\u00a0debate about all the things that have gone wrong.\u201d In many ways, A Sense of Freedom became a template for prison writing in\u00a0Britain. There have been many such\u00a0memoirs since. Some, such as\u00a0those of\u00a0the train robber Bruce Reynolds, (Autobiography of a Thief), Noel \u201cRazor\u201d Smith (A Few Kind Words and a Loaded Gun) and John Barker (Bending the Bars), have been self-reflective and well written, but too many have slipped into\u00a0vainglorious cliche. As it happens, republication of\u00a0A Sense of Freedom coincides with the arrival of Erwin James\u2019s also very powerful book Redeemable, about what\u00a0life and prison taught him. Both books should be on the bedside tables of Michael Gove and the Michael Matheson, Scottish justice secretary. Boyle wrote a subsequent memoir, The Pain of Confinement, and a novel, Hero of the Underworld, which is now being republished in Germany. There was a story many years ago that Disney had bought A Stolen Smile, a novel he wrote about the Mona Lisa being stolen and hidden on a Scottish housing estate. \u201cThe Sunday Times had the story that I\u00a0was being paid \u00a32m by Disney for it and I told them it was absolute rubbish but it made no difference,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u00a0was driving along one day with Kate [his wife, Kate Fenwick, the actor] and we had Riviera Radio on and it said that\u00a0I had sold the rights for \u00a32.1m. We\u00a0stopped dead, we couldn\u2019t believe it. But no, it was never sold and it\u2019s sitting in a drawer somewhere.\u201d His writing has, however, now become part of his art in that he is binding in leather everything he has written. \u201cI\u2019ve still got bits of writing from when I was first in trouble in 1967, tiny bits on pieces of paper the size of a\u00a0postage stamp. Everyone spills their guts these days in reality shows so I\u2019m doing the reverse and tying mine all up,\u201d he says with a laugh. Many of the characters who play a\u00a0part in the early edition of the book are dead now. Boyle attended the\u00a0funeral in 2007 of Ken Murray, the\u00a0visionary prison officer who played such a major role in the lives of both Boyle and the\u00a0long-defunct special unit, and he remains in awe of\u00a0his generosity and decency. He saw his boyhood pal, Padge Gallagher, with whom he would steal sweeties, just before he died of cancer. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Is that you, Jimmy? I\u2019m fucked\u2019.\u201d     Jimmy Boyle on release from prison in 1982. Photograph: ANL/Rex/Shutterstock    He keeps in touch with Britain by reading the Guardian, the Times and the Evening Standard online and starting his day with Radio 4. He is dismayed by what is happening politically; he made donations to the Labour party in\u00a0advance of the 1997 election but has since become disillusioned with them. \u201cI thought they did some good things and then the Iraq war killed it for me. The great hope was that they would do things for all the deprived areas but the Gorbals is now worse than it ever was, drugs everywhere. They were very arrogant.\u201d Not that he is a SNP supporter. \u201cI was never a nationalist. There\u2019s too much of that about.\u201d He rarely goes to the UK these days, now that his daughter is an interior designer in California and his son is\u00a0working in the financial sector in Singapore. He is happiest in Marrakech\u00a0where he spends most of his time\u00a0and has his studio. His gang nowadays is a\u00a0cosmopolitan bunch of\u00a0artists rather than knife-wielding heavies. As\u00a0for trying to be the invisible man, \u201cGoogle has changed all that. There\u2019s really no escape and you\u2019ve got\u00a0to live with it.\u201d In the original version of the book, there is a wonderful scene set in a pub called the British Lion on Hackney Road in east London. Boyle is on the run, under the protection of the Krays and having a pint when he notices a\u00a0lorry drawing up outside and the presence of a suspiciously large number of\u00a0men in overalls. They turn\u00a0out to be\u00a0plainclothes policemen and Boyle is\u00a0overpowered and taken back to Scotland for trial and punishment. Now the pub has become an elegant wine bar called Sager and Wilde. Where once there was a \u201cNo\u00a0Travellers\u201d sign in the window, now there is a notice announcing: \u201cTonight we are showcasing New World Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.\u201d New world, indeed. In the new A\u00a0Sense\u00a0of Freedom edition, Welsh \u2013 another working-class Scot whose writing transformed his own life \u2013 notes in his foreword that the great pleasure of going to the Cannes film festival these days is\u00a0that he gets to hang out with \u201cthis cultured, bookish man\u201d who lives nearby and whose life\u00a0is now \u201cfar removed not just from the impoverished circumstances which he\u00a0grew up in, but also, ironically, from\u00a0the grubby bedsit jakeyism of many of the redundant tabloid sleazebags who once hounded him\u201d. Now, far, far from Barlinnie, the former hard man of the Gorbals is reflective, his thoughts those of a 72-year-old who has seen life at its most savage and its\u00a0most compassionate. \u201cI ask myself what was that all about? All that violence, theft, anger and hatred for territorial gain when in\u00a0fact none of\u00a0us\u00a0own anything.\u201d \u2022 A Sense of Freedom by Jimmy Boyle is published by\u00a0Ebury.",
