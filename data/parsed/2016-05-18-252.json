  "body": "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m worried about the future that much\u201d, explains an ageing woman in Lucia Berlin\u2019s story A New Life. \u201cIt\u2019s my past that I can\u2019t get rid of, that hits me like a big wave when I least expect it.\u201d The waves of memory crash again and again in Berlin\u2019s work as she, and a variety of narrators who typically share many of the details of her biography, relate episodes that together form a body of work that is part memoir, part auto-fiction, and part single, extended story cycle.   Related: A Manual for Cleaning Women by Lucia Berlin review \u2013 an acute talent that deserves to be celebrated    Berlin died in 2004, but in 2015 a little over half of her 76 stories, written between 1960 and the early 2000s, were republished as A Manual for Cleaning Women. For most readers, a great short story writer with a substantial body of work simply appeared overnight; Berlin had commanded only a small readership when her stories originally appeared in collections in the 1980s and 90s, first through tiny publishers like Turtle Island, and later the somewhat larger Black Sparrow. The latter was also home to Charles Bukowski, who comes to mind now and then while reading Berlin\u2019s conversational, confessional, very funny and very sad stories about addicts of one sort or another, living in a chaotic semi-domesticity. Berlin\u2019s messy, complicated life provided rich compost for stories. She had a peripatetic childhood, moving from mining camps in Alaska and Montana before a job opportunity for her father saw the family transported into Chilean high society. Her parents divorced, she spent time with relatives in west Texas, married three times, gave birth to four sons and became an alcoholic (like her mother and several other members of her family). She worked as a high-school teacher, a switchboard operator, receptionist, cleaning woman and emergency room nurse (\u201cI like working in Emergency\u201d, she writes in the perfect miniature My Jockey, \u201cyou meet men there, anyway.\u201d) Work is very present in her stories, as are the ravages of daily life. A woman in a launderette \u2013 a recurring location in Berlin\u2019s fiction, and an indicator of where most of her characters find themselves on the social scale \u2013 looks down and thinks: \u201cI could see children and men and gardens in my hands\u201d. The tone, worldly wise and somewhat regretful, is a sort of hardboiled domestic.    Berlin instinctively recoils from moments that threaten sentimentality    When writing in this mode, Berlin is at her closest to Raymond Carver. \u201cI wrote like him before I ever read him,\u201d she said in a letter. \u201cHe liked my work, too \u2013 we had good talk. Recognised one another immediately.\u201d Other writers she shares at least a little DNA with include Grace Paley and Barry Hannah. Occasionally, in stories like Toda Luna, Todo A\u00f1o, her beautiful, relentless, evocative prose echoes that of James Salter. On a fundamental level, her closest parallel is Chekhov. His influence is explicit in several stories: Uncle Vanya provides the epigraph to A New Life, and Romance bears the acknowledgment \u201cafter Chekhov\u201d. But his spirit is detectable in many more, primarily through the deeply humane attitude both writers adopt towards their characters. No one is wholly bad in any of Chekhov\u2019s mature work, and no one is wholly bad in any of Berlin\u2019s; not even the drunken, dentist grandfather who sexually abuses Berlin\u2019s narrator and her sister in several of the stories. A good example of Berlin\u2019s universal empathy appears in the story Mojito:  I don\u2019t like Diane Arbus. When I was a kid in Texas there were freak shows and even then I hated the way people would point at the freaks and laugh at them. But I was fascinated too. I loved the man with no arms who typed with his toes. But it wasn\u2019t the no arms that I liked. It was that he really wrote, all day. He was seriously writing something, liking what he was writing.  This generosity of perception is a great strength in a realist writer, and it gives Berlin\u2019s characters tremendous life on the page. Even the cruel, alcoholic mother who appears in several stories is not a demon. \u201cShe was witty\u201d, the narrator\u2019s sister says in Mama. \u201cYou have to admit it. Like when she\u2019d give panhandlers a nickel and say, \u2018Excuse me, young man, but what are your dreams and aspirations?\u2019 Or when a cab driver was surly she\u2019d say, \u2018You seem rather thoughtful and introspective today.\u2019\u201d     A Manual for Cleaning Women, a collection of stories by Lucia Berlin published together in 2015. Photograph: Handout    \u201cShe hated the word love\u201d, we are told: \u201cShe said it the way people say the word slut\u201d. Getting good lines needn\u2019t equate to likeability, however, and empathy needn\u2019t entail forgiveness. Regretting that they didn\u2019t make up before her mother\u2019s suicide, the younger sister says: \u201cIf only I could have been able to speak to her. If I had let her know how much I loved her.\u201d \u201cMe\u201d, the narrator writes in response, \u201cI have no mercy.\u201d This closing exchange echoes an earlier story, and the animosity of an earlier generation. In Dr HA Moynihan, a young girl helps her grandfather (the abusive dentist) pull out all his remaining teeth (\u201cThe sound was the sound of roots being ripped out, like trees being torn from winter ground.\u201d) At the story\u2019s end the girl, wanting her mother to share the compassion she feels towards her recuperating grandfather, asks, \u201cYou don\u2019t still hate him, do you Mama?\u201d To which her mother replies, \u201c\u2018Oh, yes \u2026 Yes I do.\u201d Exchanges like these illustrate the way Berlin instinctively recoils from moments that threaten sentimentality. Tellingly, she once said that she loved Carver\u2019s work \u201cbefore he sobered up and sweetened his endings\u201d.    If Berlin is at her best when exploring character, she is at her weakest when concocting plot       However, Berlin does allow the bittersweet. The title of her story Del Gozo Al Pozo is a Mexican phrase that she translates as \u201cfrom pleasure you go to the pits\u201d. In a great many of her stories, happiness and misery don\u2019t simply follow on consecutively from one another: they repeatedly entwine. \u201cThere are things people just don\u2019t talk about,\u201d she writes in Dust to Dust. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the hard things, like love, but the awkward ones, like how funerals are fun sometimes or how it\u2019s exciting to watch buildings burning.\u201d In Emergency Room Notebook, 1977, she writes: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m morbid. I am fascinated by two fingers in a baggie, a glittering switchblade all the way out of a lean pimp\u2019s back. I like the fact that, in Emergency, everything is reparable, or not.\u201d It is this sensibility, this ability to show the interrelatedness of horror and hope: she writes truthfully about depressing situations without being depressing.  What does it mean that even when the narrators\u2019 names change (Lucia, Dolores, Claudia), the other details of their lives mostly stay the same? The abusive grandfather, the cruel mother, well-meaning but chaotic Uncle John, the bombshell cousin Bella Lynn, and most memorably of all Sally, the younger sister who is dying of cancer in Mexico City. In several stories \u2013 Wait a Minute, Mama, Grief, Fire, and Del Gozo Al Pozo \u2013 the final months of Sally\u2019s life are recounted in a variety of ways.   Related: A brief survey of the short story: David Foster Wallace    I think what Berlin is doing here has something to do with a way of thinking about life and literature that also preoccupied David Foster Wallace. Wallace often expressed the view that life is too profuse for fiction to adequately capture it. The narrator of his story Good Old Neon puts forward the most extreme version of this belief, complaining that even a small portion of our internal thought process \u201cis just too fast and huge and all interconnected for words to do more than barely sketch the outlines of at most one tiny little part of it at any given instant\u201d. Berlin seems to shares this view, that individual narratives aren\u2019t sufficient to capture certain episodes in life. As the narrator of Silence says of a piece of family lore: \u201cI know it is true that Grandpa shot him, but how it happened has about 10 different versions\u201d. It isn\u2019t just that different people have different accounts of the same event: our memories can be plastic, contradictory, vulnerable to reinterpretation. In the case of Sally\u2019s death, each time Berlin returns to it the angles are different, the focus has shifted, and yet the characters become more indelible. This isn\u2019t repetition, but a process of ongoing definition. If Berlin is at her best when exploring character, she is at her weakest when concocting plot. Plenty always happens in her stories but the events themselves are rarely the prime focus. When they come to dominate, as in the drug-smuggling-and-murder story Carmen, or Sombra\u2019s overstuffed account of a death at a Mexico City bullring, the result is melodrama. It\u2019s notable that these stories are the only places where Berlin\u2019s dialogue, one of the great strengths and pleasures of her work, becomes clunky. In her explorations of personal memory, however, Berlin is another writer entirely: one whose sure control of her material doesn\u2019t slip. Her conclusions are not comforting: the older we get, the work attests, the more our acts of remembrance become catalogues of loss. Relatives die, relationships fall apart. \u201cThe good parts are as hard to deal with as the bad ones,\u201d the ageing woman of A New Life concludes: \u201cThe point is, they are in the past.\u201d The final story Berlin wrote, BF and Me, about an old woman in a trailer home tethered to an oxygen tank, trying to get a tiler \u2013 at least as old, and almost as emphysemic \u2013 to renovate her bathroom, provides a fittingly unsentimental conclusion to her work. It invokes Proust, as several of her other stories do: one is called Temps Perdu, and in Lost in the Louvre, she visits his house at Illiers. Here, the \u201cpong\u201d of BF the tiler \u201cwas madeleine-like for me, bringing back Grandpa and Uncle John, for starters\u201d. Just as in Proust\u2019s great circular work, in Berlin the end becomes a pathway back to the beginning.",
