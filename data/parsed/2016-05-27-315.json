This isn\u2019t the stuff of fantasy if you work for Agent Marketing, a Liverpool-based consultancy specialising in behaviour change, founded 10 years ago by managing director Paul Corcoran. He is a passionate believer that happy, well-balanced staff do the best work \u2013 so making the workplace as human as possible is a no-brainer for him. \u201cIf you\u2019re coding for a new app or working on a 3D design, you can easily end up stuck at your desk for hours at a stretch. The traditional tea break\u2019s disappeared \u2013 people might leave off work for a bit, but then just sit and stare at their phones \u2013 so we wanted to try something different.\u201d They brought in yoga and meditation training, and a monthly massage, to encourage staff to take real, if brief, breaks. \u201cThey come back feeling amazingly refreshed,\u201d he adds.   Related: Does a pretty office make a productive workforce?    Agent doesn\u2019t just hand out the sweeties to its own people; it matches it with a strong commitment to volunteering and pro bono work. When the refugee crisis hit the headlines, Corcoran offered its services to the British Red Cross, helping organise With Love from Liverpool, a concert featuring Liverpool bands the Icicle Works and the Christians and comedian John Bishop that raised \u00a350,000 for refugee relief. He\u2019s adamant that all this makes good business sense, too. \u201cCompanies come to us because they\u2019re not looking for the same old, same old. They want to work with organisations that stand for something.\u201d He\u2019s now set up Agent Academy, a social enterprise that teaches unemployed youngsters good marketing and communication skills \u2013 along with the values Agent embodies. Before this all sounds too good to be true, Corcoran\u2019s quick to acknowledge that balancing the pursuit of wellbeing with the need to deliver work can be something of a balancing act.    Unless you embed it into your company and culture, then nine times out of 10 it\u2019s lip service    Take that six-hour \u201cScandinavian-style\u201d working day, which Agent trialled at the end of last year, in the full glare of cameras from BBC\u2019s The One Show. Although staff loved having time to do all their \u201clife admin\u201d \u2013 not to mention travelling home in daylight \u2013 they soon found that walking out of the door at 4pm meant deadlines were going out the window. And as Corcoran admits: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do good work, we won\u2019t have any clients, and then we\u2019ll have zero hours to the day. And not in a good way.\u201d So the company compromised, and is now piloting two six-hour days a week \u201cwhich so far seems to be working.\u201d But he insists that treating staff like humans, and spreading their skills to the wider community, will always be at the core of their work. \u201cYou have to walk it, you have to live it. It can\u2019t be an add on. All the standard CSR stuff, handing over a big cheque once a year, it\u2019s all well and good, but unless you embed it into your company and culture and it becomes part of what your business is, then nine times out of 10 it\u2019s lip service. And what\u2019s the point of that?\u201d Paul Corcoran is the 2016 winner of the leader of the year category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards.",
