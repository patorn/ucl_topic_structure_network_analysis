Related: How to break a Guinness World Record    The Guinness World Records reported on its website that 37-year-old Franky Zapata travelled 2.2km (7,388ft) off the French coastal town of Sausset-les-Pins on Saturday at a height of 50m (165ft) above the surface of the water. It said a Guinness World Records official was on hand for the flight and determined that it beat the previous record of 275.9m (905ft) by Canadian Catlin Alexandru Duru last year. After the successful flight, which was watched by more than 200 people, Zapata said: \u201cThis has really been a life\u2019s work\u201d.     Franky Zapata on the Flyboard Air.

You have to experience this moment in your life.\u201d Zapata, a jet ski champion, used a craft known as the Flyboard Air developed by his company Zapata Racing. According to the company, the Flyboard Air can fly for up to ten minutes and has a maximum speed of 150kph (93mph).
