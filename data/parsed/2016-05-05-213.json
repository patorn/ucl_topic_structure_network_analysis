  "body": "Sun managing editor Stig Abell may have left the paper for the heady heights of the TLS, but editor Tony Gallagher is clearly trying to steer it in a more literary direction.  In a review headlined \u201cAbbey to expose the truth: Downton star Hugh Bonneville plays hero in new play about press freedom\u201d, it gushes about the star\u2019s \u201cmarvellous\u201d performance in Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People.  \u201cActor Hugh Bonneville returned to the stage last night in a play about newspapers, cover-ups and lies,\u201d it begins, adding:  Hugh Bonneville ditches his safe family man image for a performance packed with passion and desire as he fights to reveal a corrosive secret in his first return to the stage in more than a decade. Forget the staid Earl of Grantham of TV\u2019s Downton Abbey fame; this Bonneville character throws himself headlong into the fiercest of battles against lies and deceit with admirable determination.  The truth and who deserves to hear it, no matter what cost to reputation and image, is an age-old question as relevant today as when Henrik Ibsen posed it in 1882, and the Norwegian playwright could have wished for no better advocate than Bonneville ... TV fans of Downton\u2019s slow-paced period drama might be surprised by the red-hot fervour the actor is capable of in his pursuit of satisfaction.\u201d  Editor Tony Gallagher responded to praise for the move on Twitter:    @NickCohen4 @TheSun happy to oblige.  One of my earliest calls was reviving the theatre critic's role\u2014 Tony Gallagher (@tonygallagher) May 5, 2016    Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph also opts to push the drama to the fore, printing a picture of a finger-wagging actor under the headline \u201cBonneville, champion of free speech\u201d.  Monkey looks forward to the Sun\u2019s commitment to drama continuing \u2013 perhaps \u201cShakespeare backs Brexit\u201d on tomorrow\u2019s front page?",
