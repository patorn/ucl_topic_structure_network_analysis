The Iona Community has launched an urgent appeal to raise \u00a31.5m to redevelop the buildings of St Colomba\u2019s monastery. Without the work, the community could become \u201cunfit for purpose\u201d within a few years. In a report to the Church of Scotland\u2019s general assembly, meeting in Edinburgh this week, the community said: \u201cSignificant needs have been building over a number of years \u2026 which, if not addressed imminently, will place the long-term sustainability of the centre at significant risk.\u201d It added: \u201cThe impact of this on the island community of Iona would be catastrophic.\u201d Although the abbey was rebuilt from ruins 50 years ago, it needs further extensive work to meet modern standards to accommodate pilgrims and tourists. The required work includes new electrical, plumbing and heating systems and updated and fully accessible accommodation. A complicating factor is that the abbey is a listed building of significant historical interest on a remote island. \u201cPiecemeal maintenance and sporadic upgrading of internal services, electrical, water, sewerage and heating have led to constant and uneconomic patchwork repairs,\u201d the report says. \u201cIf action is not taken now to improve the fabric of the buildings and the associated utilities, there is the prospect of the accommodation being unfit for purpose in five to seven years\u2019 time, which would in turn place the Iona Community\u2019s presence on Iona in serious jeopardy.\u201d An appeal for donations raised \u00a3275,000 by the end of last year, well below the \u00a31.5m needed. \u201cThis is the most demanding challenge the Iona Community has faced since the rebuilding of the abbey itself,\u201d the community\u2019s leader, Peter Macdonald, told the Herald. The community, founded in 1938 by George MacLeod, now runs three residential centres on Iona and the nearby island of Mull. In 1994, John Smith was buried in the cemetery of Iona Abbey after dying of a heart attack while leader of the Labour party. Thousands of people visited Smith\u2019s grave in the following year, causing serious damage to Scotland\u2019s earliest Christian settlement, according to locals. Smith was succeeded by Tony Blair. \u201cPeople from different walks of life, nationalities, faiths and circumstances encounter one another though being engaged in common tasks \u2013 preparing meals, washing up, creating music for a service in the abbey or breaking bread together,\u201d the director Rosie Magee wrote in the report. \u201cRelationships are forged, sometimes unlikely ones, which cross cultural barriers and recognise our common search for significance and meaning in a hurting world.\u201d The original monastic community was founded by Colomba, an Irish monk, almost 1,500 years ago.",
