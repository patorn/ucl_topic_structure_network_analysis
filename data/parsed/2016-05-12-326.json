They get stuck: at a certain height, in a certain mindset, in what they wear, listen to, and in what they read. In The Girl of Ink & Stars, the grown-ups have become stuck in what they think is possible. Isabella\u2019s theories about the strange occurrences on her island are discounted because she is a child, and a girl. Yet her open-minded approach to the world allows her to see the truth, and that makes her the only one who can save her home.  Young people tend to be the bravest readers. I\u2019ve met many adults who say \u201cI don\u2019t read children\u2019s books\u201d as if they are in a foreign language they never learnt. But many of them are teaching big, bold lessons disguised as beautiful, challenging stories. Here is a small selection of the many incredible books for children that adults would also do well to read, learn from, and enjoy. So if you like the sound of any of these books, try recommending them to the adult in your life. Tell them, \u201cGo on, grown-ups \u2013 grow a little.\u201d    Related: 10 wild facts about Maurice Sendak's Where The Wild Things Are     1. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak  You\u2019ve probably already heard of or read this classic story of Max, the boy who sails away from home to frolic with the Wild Things, ends with his dinner waiting, \u201cstill hot\u201d. You\u2019ll take away an adventure that ends with the comfort of home, and if you get your grown-up to read it, they will recognise that the frustrations of childhood emotions may become easier to articulate, but they never really go away. Told in sparing words and lush pictures with real emotional punch, you have to wonder why, as our vocabulary improves, we turn from imagery as storytelling.

Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman  Blackman\u2019s book taught me, and many people for whom it was not a daily reality, to see racism for the first time, in terms we could understand. \u201cPlasters were the colour of us Crosses, not the noughts\u2026\u201d The image of the black plaster on white skin has stayed with me as a simple and brilliant way of condensing the concept of privilege. Blackman\u2019s novel also gives blistering credence to the power of words \u2013 as Sephy says, \u201cWhoever came up with the saying \u2018sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me\u2019 was talking out of his or her armpit.\u201d An eye-opening book for any child that adults would do well to read, or re-read.  3. The Wave by Morton Rhue  Have you ever wondered how you would react when faced with evil? Based on Ron Jones\u2019 classroom experiment of 1979, The Wave follows Ross, a teacher who attempts to explain how Nazi Germany, and the Holocaust, was allowed to happen through creating a movement called the Wave. Of course it soon takes on a life of its own, with its followers\u2019 actions spiraling out of control. We all conform, and this book explores the consequences of that in extremis. Is inaction the same as complicity?   Related: The greatest Frances Hardinge quotes ever     4. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge  Aside from the lyrical writing and gripping mystery that sits at its heart, this book is an exploration of the fall-out from a major parental lie. Set in post-Origin of the Species Victorian Britain, Hardinge\u2019s heroine Faith finds herself constricted by being a girl, and by her father\u2019s expectations of her. \u201cListen, Faith. A girl cannot be brave, or clever, or skilled as a boy can. If she is not good, she is nothing.\u201d When he turns up dead, Faith must be brave, clever, skilled, and most certainly not \u201cgood\u201d.

It\u2019s often easier to be truthful through a skewed lens, and if your adult doesn\u2019t want to read a children\u2019s book, this would be a good place to start changing their mind. An epic story of light versus dark, and the shadows that slink in the gaps, it grapples with complex ideas around innocence, childhood, power, and the Authority. It\u2019s also an incredible adventure, with an ending that will probably make you cry (unless you don\u2019t have a heart).   Related: Why we need to be honest about OCD and teen mental health     6. Am I Normal Yet? By Holly Bourne  Be honest \u2013 how often do you use words like \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cmental\u201d, or \u201cinsane\u201d without thinking twice? A brutal and brilliant takedown of how we talk about mental illness, feminism, and friendship, this book is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. It follows Evie, and her friends Lottie and Amber, as they navigate their way through the minefield of school, boys, and periods. If you\u2019ve ever felt out of the ordinary, this is for you (ie everyone). It manages to be enjoyable without being flippant, incisive without being preachy. My first thought having finished it was \u201cI wish I\u2019d read this when I was a teenager\u201d, but in all truth I think it\u2019s just as valuable to have read it now. So have a read - I guarantee you and your adult will enjoy it. You\u2019re never too old to drop some stigma.    Related: Benjamin Zephaniah interview: To me it\u2019s not about black, white, Asian; it\u2019s about literature for everybody     7. Refugee Boy by Benjamin Zephaniah  This book is 15 years old, and more vital than ever. In a time when our government voted against accepting 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children, Alem\u2019s story will ring cringingly true. Not all people welcome him, or believe in his story. Some just don\u2019t care. Economics are this lack of care disguised as practicality \u2013 Alem realises people resent being asked to share even a small proportion of their wealth. Polemic aside, this is a beautiful telling of a desperate story. Phoenix by SF Said tackles similar themes of home and displacement in an intergalactic setting.   Related: My hero: Robin Williams by Anne Fine    \u00a08. The Tulip Touch by Anne Fine \u00a0Another cautionary tale on the consequences of inaction, The Tulip Touch was disturbing to me as a child and even more so as an adult. When Natalie befriends Tulip, their games soon escalate from the peculiar to the dangerous. Natalie\u2019s parents quickly distance themselves and their child from Tulip, without wanting to see what is causing Tulip\u2019s behaviour. Natalie is too young to recognise the hallmarks of abuse, but her parents are not \u2013 yet they do not act. Would you be able to recognise and help a girl like Tulip? Would you? 9. Panther by David Owen Derrick\u2019s heard reports of a panther in his neighbourhood, and attaches his happiness, and the happiness of his family, on finding it. This is not an \u201ceasy\u201d book, but depression is not an easy illness. In a time when the leading cause of death in males under fifty is suicide, Derrick\u2019s narrative feels like essential reading. Patrick Ness\u2019s A Monster Calls is another story worth reading for anyone who finds it hard to understand or communicate around such themes.

Asking For It by Louise O\u2019Neill As the next grown-ups, it\u2019s down to young people now to make the world a better place \u2013 and reading this book is a powerful way to start. \u201cThey\u2019re good boys really. This all just got out of hand.\u201d When terms like \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d dominate our language, a view of their effects is offered in this harrowing and masterful book. When Emma is gang-raped at a party, it is her peers\u2019 and adults\u2019 reaction that inflicts the deepest damage. An unflinching dissection of rape culture, Asking For It should be required reading for teenagers, all men, all women, and anyone in-between.
