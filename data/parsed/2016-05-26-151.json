  "body": "THE ASCII ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS MOURINHO  Who knew that each and every time in the last decade that you bought a Jos\u00e9 Mourinho-themed lace bodice, part of the proceeds went to Chelsea FC? And all those Mourinho-branded toys that you bought for your kids to throw from their prams at hard-working officials, well, they helped fund the purchases of Fernando Torres and Juan Cuadrado. Chelsea, you see, bought the trademark to Mourinho\u2019s name in 2005 and now the Portuguese wants it back even though Chelsea have valiantly resisted any temptation to attach it to a range of toilet paper or stink bombs.   Related: After-shave and napkin rings \u2013 Mourinho\u2019s image rights delay Manchester United appointment    In point of fact, it is Manchester United, rather than Mourinho himself, who want the rights now and their negotiations with Chelsea are the reason for the delay in announcing the appointment of Mourinho (\u2122) as their new manager. Because it just wouldn\u2019t be seemly for someone else to have a commercial interest in the manager of Chevrolet\u2019s Manchester United brought to you in association with Apollo Tyres, DHL, Aeroflot, etc and so forth. With millions of pounds at stake, it could be a while before the clubs thrash out a deal, although The Fiver fully expects Mourinho (\u2122) to find a way of wriggling free of these binds before that, possibly by taking inspiration from the late Prince and reinventing himself as a symbol. In these modern times something that can be typed out on a keypad would be ideal. Unicode 2646 (\u2646) seems perfect for any manager of United, although some may say that Mourinho (\u2122) would be better represented by Unicode 2623 (\u2623) or Unicode 261E (\u261e). The Fiver, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t be bothered finding out whether anyone already has a legal claim to Unicodes so reckons some appropriate ASCII art could provide the metaphorical laundry basket from which Mourinho (\u2122) can operate henceforth. So from now on, or for as long as we can sustain the mood, we\u2019ll be referring to the manager formerly known as Mourinho (\u2122) as:  .\u201c\u201d. .\u201c\u201d, | | / / | | / / | | / / | | / ;\u2013._ } ` _/ / ; | /` ) / /  | / /_/ \\_/\\ | / / |  ( \u2018 \\ \u2018- | \\ `. / | | | |     Assuming our system now fails to deal with it once launched.

But [Didier] Deschamps, he has a really French name. Maybe he is the only one in France to have a truly French name. Nobody in his family mixed with anybody, you know. Like the Mormons in America. So I\u2019m not surprised he used the situation of Benzema not to take him. Especially after [French PM, Manuel] Valls said he should not play for France. And Ben Arfa is maybe the best player in France today. But they have some origins. I am allowed to think about that\u201d \u2013 Eric Cantona with some strong views on the make-up of France\u2019s Euro 2016 squad.     Didier in the land of giants.

The core conceit of that movie was that the central character had to spend $30m in 30 days and have nothing to show for it. Eliaquim Mangala cost \u00a331.8m. Sounds like Manuel Pellegrini beat Pep to it. And then some\u201d \u2013 Derek McGee. \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters. I bet Rio Ferdinand enjoyed  Gary Mantle\u2019s piece\u201d \u2013Andy Korman. \u201cIn response to Jeremy Adams (yesterday\u2019s letters) where he talks about Woodstock, NY being stuck in the 70s \u2018before the internet was even born\u2019. Can I be the first of 1,057 pedants to inform him that the internet was \u2018born\u2019 in the 1960s\u201d \u2013 Jim Scragg (and no others). \u201cFollowing on from Lochlan McDonald (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) \u2026 if Noble Francis-Noble-Francis were to emigrate to Europe and have a child, giving that child the name Francis and also the middle name of his father, Noble, and said child went on to play for his national team, he could be referred to as: France\u2019s Francis Noble Francis-Noble-Francis. Even better if he were then to live in Grenoble\u201d \u2013 Karl Gibbons. \u201cI think we have all been duped. I have it on good authority that Noble Francis is in fact the alter ego of one Gerald Wiley\u201d \u2013 Mark Cosgrove. \u201cAmid all the unnecessary fuss, I\u2019d like to just wish Noble Francis a good day\u201d \u2013 Ahmed Aly. \u201cWith all this talk of Noble Francis it will be interesting to see when they decide to make their return. Will they write in nonchalantly like nothing ever happened at some unspecified time in the future, come storming back immediately with a Noble-Francisesque retort, or will they lay low for a long time waiting for the heat to die down?\u201d \u2013 Ross Wilson. \u201cIf it makes readers feel any better, I\u2019m off to Paris for a couple of weeks soon, so they should be OK for a while\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cIn answer to Chad Stoner\u2019s query (yesterday\u2019s letters), I now restrict myself to reading The Fiver when people wondered what happened to me. Which encouragingly is about every 12 months or so. It\u2019s like the mafia \u2013 just when you think you\u2019re out \u2026\u201d \u2013 Paul Jurdeczka. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

BITS AND BOBS Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been teasing hacks about his future at Sweden\u2019s pre-Euro 2016 training camp. \u201cThere is a lot being written about my next move, and I enjoy reading what you come up with,\u201d he cooed. \u201cOne day I am moving to this club, the next I am 90% sure to go there, and 10% sure to go there.
