  "body": "West Ham United face competition from Tottenham Hotspur in their efforts to sign Callum Wilson from Bournemouth, with Slaven Bilic\u2019s side expected to return with an improved offer in the next few days. Bournemouth\u2019s manager, Eddie Howe, confirmed after Tuesday night\u2019s defeat at Manchester United that the south-coast club had rejected a double offer for Wilson and the winger Matt Ritchie. That is believed to have been worth up to \u00a325m including add-ons for the pair, who were purchased by the club for a total of \u00a33.4m in 2014 and 2013 respectively.

However, they will face a significant fight for the signature of Wilson, who scored five Premier League goals before missing most of the season with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Mauricio Pochettino wants to boost Tottenham\u2019s attacking options for next season and the Argentinian manager is understood to be interested in the former Coventry striker. The Cameroon international Clinton Nji\u00e9 has yet to make an impact since joining last summer and Wilson fits the profile of a speedy striker to augment this season\u2019s Golden Boot winner, Harry Kane. Bournemouth have insisted that they do not want to sell one of their prized assets but it is thought that a bid of around \u00a320m could be enough to persuade them to sell. \u201cWe had a bid yesterday evening,\u201d Howe said on Tuesday. \u201cThe disappointing thing from my perspective is why the bid has come the day before a game. \u201cYou have the whole season to bid for players. I don\u2019t understand that. They were two players who were due to play and there\u2019s a lot of speculation surrounding their futures. That was bizarre. \u201cIt was rejected. We don\u2019t need to sell. We\u2019ve got a really ambitious owner. We want to improve our squad. Our biggest challenge is going to be keeping the players we have. We love the guys we\u2019re working with. We respect them as people.\u201d West Ham are still waiting to hear back from Marseille after lodging a club record \u00a331.5m bid for the Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi earlier this month. The 22-year-old is considered a more realistic target than Lacazette, with Lyon demanding almost \u00a340m for the France international. Liverpool\u2019s Christian Benteke is also on Bilic\u2019s shortlist as he searches for new recruits ready for the move to the Olympic Stadium.",
