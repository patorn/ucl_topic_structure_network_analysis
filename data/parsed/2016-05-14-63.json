Before taking the photographs from which he constructs his paintings, artist Toby Brown asks his subjects to describe how they feel when they are depressed. \u201cIn that split second, they kind of go back \u2013 and I take my snapshots to work from,\u201d he explained. On Thursday the Debut Contemporary gallery in Notting Hill, west London, will showcase the extraordinary results, almost exclusively featuring sufferers of mental ill health.   Related: Care for children with mental health problems is woeful, say GPs    The subjects of the portraits include family and friends, but Brown has also persuaded a number of well-known sufferers of depression to pose for him, including Tony Blair\u2019s former director of communications, Alastair Campbell, and an array of names from stage and screen. More significantly, however, Brown himself knows all too well how clinical depression feels. The former motorcycle courier has been blighted by depression on and off since 2008 when, as the recession hit, he found himself with a \u00a3120,000 mortgage, a \u00a330,000 credit card debt and letters from the bailiffs. With his life spiralling out of control, Brown started on a cocktail of anti-depressants, sleeping pills, the antipyschotic drug Olanzapine and illegal drugs. He was admitted to the Priory hospital in west London as his marriage collapsed, along with his family business. But at rock bottom, living in a caravan on an industrial estate, Brown, now 51, reinvented himself. \u201cEveryone had said to me: \u2018Why can\u2019t you just get on with your day?\u2019 So I decided to throw some paint,\u201d he said. \u201cI did three self- portraits to try to show what was going on underneath. That is where it all started.\u201d Brown\u2019s self-portraits were spotted by Samir Ceric, founder of the Debut Contemporary gallery, and an idea was born. \u201cBeing married to a designer of luxury handbags who has suffered on and off from depression and battles anxiety, his subject matter, his personal experience, resonated with me,\u201d said Ceric.     An unfinished portrait of Amy Winehouse by Toby Brown    It hasn\u2019t been easy. The project \u2013 involving 18 portraits, the largest of which is six feet by four feet \u2013 has been a year in the making. \u201cWe approached people, but they didn\u2019t want to open up, so that has been quite a difficult journey,\u201d Brown admitted. However, with the backing of the mental health charity Mind, people were persuaded, and after contacting Campbell through Twitter the two met recently to allow the artist to sketch and take snapshots. Campbell believes Brown has caught something. \u201cI was in a really good mood that day,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThe medication was working, Burnley had been promoted to the Premier League. All was going well. Toby asked me to describe what depression felt like. It is like being dead and alive at the same time.\u201d Campbell, who worked in Downing Street from 1997 to 2003, added: \u201cFiona [Campbell\u2019s partner] thinks the painting is quite good. My daughter, Grace, found it more challenging, although she has seen me depressed. I think when I\u2019m not active my eyes do go a bit dead. Toby concentrates on the eyes.\u201d The timing of the exhibition is poignant. Last week Sally Brampton, 60, the author, former fashion editor of the Observer and founding editor of British Elle, took her own life after a battle with depression. The circumstances of her death are unclear, but it is thought that she walked into the sea at St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex, near her home. \u201cKilling oneself is, anyway, a misnomer,\u201d Brampton had written in her acclaimed memoir on depression, Shoot the Damn Dog. \u201cWe don\u2019t kill ourselves. We are simply defeated by the long, hard struggle to stay alive.\u201d \u201cI knew her,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would do what she did. I don\u2019t know what was going through her mind. But I know what it is like to feel like things can\u2019t be any worse. And I think this cultural space is incredibly important \u2013 TV, radio, theatre, art. That is what drives the cultural change in attitudes [to mental health] that will lead to the political change.\u201d     Toby Brown    Among the other famous names who agreed to pose for Brown are the presenter and vocal coach Carrie Grant; the lead singer of the indie group Embrace, Danny McNamara; This Morning presenter Anna Williamson; former Coronation Street actress Georgia Taylor; and singer-songwriter Sandi Thom. All of them are fellow sufferers. Brown\u2019s painting of McNamara is set to go on the cover of Embrace\u2019s next album. The artist has also painted the singer Amy Winehouse, from a photograph that was found on her computer after her death in July 2011. \u201cThe photo came on for a split second in Asif Kapadia\u2019s movie about her,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI remember saying to my girlfriend that it would be amazing to have that in the show. I tracked it down. It is a kind of selfie.\u201d His paintings have a misty quality, Brown added, partly because he was born with a squint and with only 35% vision in his left eye. \u201cAlso, I don\u2019t really paint, I scrub the canvas,\u201d he said of his works, which will be on sale for prices ranging from about \u00a33,000 to \u00a310,000. \u201cI use quite big brushes, often decorators\u2019 brushes. It is quite aggressive.\u201d   Related: Family doctors fear a mental health scandal waiting to happen | Dr Nihara Krause    Brown, who will be donating 20% of Thursday\u2019s takings to Mind, added, however, that he uses more delicate brushes for the focus of his work. \u201cThe eyes of the subject are very detailed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eyes kind of tell you what is going on. People who suffer from depression might be smiling, but you just need to look at their eyes and it is kind of dead.\u201d",
