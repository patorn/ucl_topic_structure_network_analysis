  "body": "Hillary Clinton is entering uncharted territory in this presidential election. If she wins the White House, she would become the first female president, the first spouse of a former president to hold the office herself, and, possibly, the first president to have devoted time on the campaign trail to discussing UFOs. \u201cThere are enough stories out there that I don\u2019t think everybody is just sitting in their kitchen, making them up,\u201d Clinton said in a radio interview in April.  A month earlier, she had appeared on the Jimmy Kimmel show, correcting Kimmel\u2019s use of \u201cUFO\u201d to \u201cUAP\u201d \u2013 unidentified aerial phenomena. When Kimmel reminded Clinton that her husband, Bill, had looked for information while president and found nothing, she was defiant.  \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna do it again,\u201d Clinton said. The pledges \u2013 she also told the told the Conway Daily Sun that she would \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of whether the government has tucked away information on aliens \u2013 are exciting UFO enthusiasts. But they are puzzling some experts on the subject. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what she thinks there is out there,\u201d said Nick Pope, an author and journalist who used to investigate UFOs for the British government\u2019s ministry of defence. Pope ran the British government\u2019s UFO project from 1991 to 1994 (the investigation unit was wound up in 2009). But America\u2019s own dedicated UFO research effort, called Project Blue Book, ended in 1969, Pope said. Clinton\u2019s embrace of the UFO discussion has been credited to her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The New York Times reported that he ran an X-Files fan club while he worked under Bill Clinton in the White House, and wrote in a foreword for a book on UFOs that it was \u201ctime to pull back the curtain\u201d on the subject. Podesta was a counsellor to Barack Obama until February 2015. Upon leaving the White House, he lamented that no new information on UFOs had been released. \u201cFinally, my biggest failure of 2014: once again not securing the disclosure of the UFO files,\u201d Podesta tweeted. But Pope said there weren\u2019t actually any \u201cUFO files\u201d. Since Project Blue Book ended, the US has not had a formal unit investigating UFOs. And the files from Blue Book are already available in the national archives. \u201cPodesta\u2019s statements, like Clinton\u2019s statements,\u201d he said, imply something \u201clike in the Raiders of the Lost Ark movie, some kind of government warehouse where there\u2019s something above and beyond the old Blue Book files.\u201d \u201cAnd as far as I know,\u201d he added, \u201cthere isn\u2019t.\u201d Pope said that there may have been \u201cad hoc investigations done\u201d when pilots saw something unusual in the sky, but they were not part of a \u201cformally constituted research effort\u201d.  Ted Roe is the executive director of the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (Narcap), an independent body that collects reports from pilots and radar operators on unidentified aerial phenomena, the term apparently preferred by Clinton. Roe suspects the government may not be telling us everything it knows.     Clinton told Jimmy Kimmel she would seek information on UAPs as president. Photograph: Randy Holmes/AP    He recalled that Leslie Kean, a journalist who concentrates on UFOs, made a freedom of information request to the government regarding an incident in Pennsylvania. The government refused, and a lawsuit ensued. The government lost and was ordered to provide the files and documents relating to the Pennsylvania incident. \u201cThose documents were not forthcoming. She never did get them,\u201d Roe said. \u201cThey claim they\u2019re lost. So there may well be files that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d But if there are questions over what Clinton expects to be able to release, there are also questions as to why she would be discussing UFOs at all. \u201cI just can\u2019t understand what she\u2019s playing at,\u201d Pope said. \u201cI can\u2019t see there\u2019s any votes in it. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s some kind of swing vote middle ground that\u2019s desperately keen on this issue.  \u201cAnd it\u2019s an absolute gift to Donald Trump, because you can almost see him up at that podium saying: \u2018I\u2019m committed to American jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the economy and my opponent seems to be more interested in space aliens.\u2019\u201d Clinton\u2019s interest in UFOs during an election cycle has raised the issue high enough that Barack Obama\u2019s press secretary had to field questions on Area 51, the secretive Nevada air base, on Wednesday. Josh Earnest said he was \u201cnot aware of any plans the president has to make public any information about this\u201d.   Related: Clinton would consider declassifying government documents related to UFOs    Area 51 has become synonymous with UFOs and extraterrestrials among some enthusiasts. If there were UFO files, they would likely have information on anything stored in the base, and some conspiracy theories suggest the site contains parts of an alien vessel. Others suggest there could be actual alien remains. Pope was not optimistic. \u201cI would love there to be aliens,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world would be a much more interesting place if we did have a spaceship in a hangar.\u201d \u201cBut A, without wanting to sound too arrogant, I hope that I would have heard about it through having security clearance and need to know.  \u201cAnd B, yes, I know we can keep some secrets but in these days of whistleblowers and Wikileaks and Snowden and Manning and Assange, all of that, you\u2019d think there would have been something tangible by now.\u201d Roe, who has spent the last 16 years working with Narcap, patiently logging thousands of reports on unidentified aerial phenomena, is sceptical that any documents on alien life will be released any time soon. He said Clinton\u2019s quest for information was likely doomed. \u201cI don\u2019t know that a president is even in the need to know on certain aspects of security. This might be one of those subjects,\u201d he said. \u201cShe may not ever know about this stuff or ever get the access to it.\u201d And even if Clinton did come across evidence of extraterrestrial life, Roe warned that the knowledge would come with a heavy burden. \u201cThis is some serious, serious stuff and a lot of our best minds, like Stephen Hawking, have suggested that any exposure to an extraterrestrial civilisation would be catastrophic,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt could be an extinction-level event.\u201d",
