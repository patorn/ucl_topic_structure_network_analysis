  "body": "The chairman of the Republican party has called on Donald Trump to reassure conservatives worried about his presidential nomination by releasing more names of potential supreme court justices he would pick if elected. Speaking as the party reeled from the unexpectedly swift coronation of Trump this week, Reince Priebus also revealed that the New York billionaire had rung him \u201cwithin minutes\u201d of hearing that House speaker Paul Ryan was refusing to endorse him and asked: \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d Priebus, whose role as chairman of the Republican National Committee is to try to heal the rift before its convention in Cleveland this July, said he told Trump to \u201crelax and be gracious\u201d. Yet, like Ryan, Priebus urged Trump to reach out to help unify the party when the presumptive nominee meets Republicans on Capitol Hill next week. \u201cA smart thing for Donald Trump to do would to release five to 10 names of people that he would pull from: \u2018Here\u2019s 10 folks who I think would make great supreme court justices\u2019,\u201d Priebus said during a Politico breakfast discussion in Washington on Friday. \u201cThings like that would be helpful in recalibrating some people\u2019s minds as far as \u2018why do we need to support the Republican nominee?\u2019... I think we\u2019re going to get there.\u201d Trump has already floated at least two names of conservatives he might pick for the supreme court vacancy, but Priebus acknowledged that the swift turn of events this week was raising fresh questions in the party about his suitability. \u201cI am sure it is going to take some time to get into general election mode and out of primary mode,\u201d the RNC chair said when asked about some of Trump\u2019s more controversial outbursts during the bitterly fought contest. \u201cHe\u2019s trying. Honestly I think he\u2019s trying,\u201d added Priebus, to laughter, when asked what he thought about the latest controversy over a tweet from Trump eating a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo and claiming it showed how much \u201cloves Hispanics\u201d. But Priebus dismissed talk of fresh attempts to derail the nomination process in Cleveland with an alternative candidate, something he described as still \u201cpossible, but highly, highly unlikely\u201d. He also rejected the idea floated by Nebraska senator Ben Sasse that conservatives might rally behind an independent candidate running against Trump and Clinton. \u201cThe amount of time, energy, money,\u201d responded Priebus. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a guarantee to elect Hillary Clinton. When people take a breath and calm down they are going to understand that the supreme court is too important to let differences of opinions get in the way.\u201d Priebus also backed the House speaker on the issue of whether the party should rally behind Trump\u2019s controversial call to ban Muslims from entering the country. \u201cI\u2019m agreement [with Ryan] on the ban coming in. I had put a statement out on that already. It\u2019s not something that I believe in, or our party believes in. I believe that our party is the party of the open door. Our party is the party of opportunity and equality and it always will remain such.\u201d Priebus suggested the Republican party leadership might try to convince Trump to back down on this but had not discussed it yet: \u201cIt\u2019s been like three days, so we\u2019re not quite there yet ... [we\u2019ll] get the speaker on board and get into some of those details later.\u201d The RNC chair also bristled at suggestions of a \u201chostile takeover\u201d by Trump. Asked if it was his party now, Priebus replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the party\u2019s party.\u201d He acknowledged that in practice they would jointly organise the running order of the convention in July and that Trump would probably receive an entry card to party headquarters in Washington, but Priebus insisted he would remain in charge of the RNC, not the presumptive nominee. Nonetheless the RNC chair acknowledged recent tensions had strained relations between Trump and the party, revealing he had \u201cneedled\u201d Trump about his claim that the nomination process was rigged once it became clear he had won nonetheless. \u201cHe laughed,\u201d said Priebus, when asked what the response was. Later at a White House press conference, Barack Obama was asked about Ryan\u2019s refusal to back Trump. \u201cI think you have to ask Speaker Ryan what the implications of his comments are,\u201d the president said. \u201cThere is no doubt that there is a debate that\u2019s taking place within the Republican party about who they are and what they represent.\u201d He added of Trump: \u201cRepublican women voters are going to have to decide, is that the guy who I feel comfortable with, and representing me, and what I care about?\u201d Additional reporting by Tom McCarthy in New York",
