Share your thoughts about these city stories \u2013 and any others you\u2019ve seen \u2013 in the comments below. New York\u2019s Post-it battle Office buildings opposite one another in the Canal Street area in lower Manhattan are in the midst of what can only be described as a \u201cPost-it war\u201d, using nothing but multicoloured sticky notes and their windows. What is essentially just competitive procrastination seems to have turned in to a new form of street art.  The battle, as New York magazine explains, started out with a simple message spelling out \u201chi\u201d in sticky notes, but now both office blocks have extensive and elaborate messages and designs in their windows \u2013 from cartoon characters and aquarium scenes to Beyonc\u00e9 lyrics. The battle of creativity even has its own hashtag where you can follow the action, #canalnotes, where other people around the world are adding their own sticky note window art \u2013 from Manchester to Tokyo.

But it\u2019s not just airless inter-office tunnels: an open green walkway connecting rooftops has been proposed in Stockholm as a public park with views over the city.  Floating Tokyo Cities see new developments spring up all the time. But for every project that breaks ground there are others which are shelved, or even too unrealistic to be considered. King\u2019s Cross in London almost got an airport. In Tokyo, renowned architect Kenz\u014d Tange envisaged a floating extension of the city in 1960 with Tokyo Bay Plan. As Christopher Beanland explains in The Long + Short, Tange planned a grand axis across the bay: \u201ceach side of the axis (comprising freeways and services) would be platforms like oil rigs on which would sit crazy combinations of buildings stacked up and plugged in to each other\u201d. Although the project was cancelled, a similar project (perhaps inspired by Tange\u2019s designs?) has been proposed as a floating flood defence for the Japanese capital. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates with Leslie E Robertson Associates, the \u201cNext Tokyo 2045\u201d proposal involves the creation of a whole new city built on reclaimed islands in Tokyo Bay, arranged in a series of hexagons and including a mile-high skyscraper, to act as a flood barrier protecting Tokyo. Moving a city As we reported last year, the northernmost city in Sweden, Kiruna, is in the process of demolishing its city centre and rebuilding it two miles down the road, to avoid collapsing into the huge iron-ore mine that the city grew up around. But how exactly do you move a city? A new film from the Swedish Institute, This Is Kiruna, speaks to the architects, planners and the locals to find out what\u2019s going on now.
