  "body": "A downbeat Diego Simeone did not confirm whether he wanted to continue as Atl\u00e9tico Madrid coach on Saturday after enduring a second agonising Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid in three years. After Atl\u00e9tico came from a goal behind to take the game into extra time at 1-1, it was Real who prevailed 5-3 in the penalty shootout, adding to Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s pain of the 4-1 defeat against their city rivals in the 2014 final in Lisbon.   Related: Real Madrid twist the knife again to give Atl\u00e9tico the cruellest of nights | Sid Lowe    Simeone, who has won every major trophy with Atl\u00e9tico in his four and a half years in charge apart from the Champions League, cast his future at the club into doubt when asked if he had thought about resigning. \u201cDo I have to continue with Atl\u00e9tico or is it the end of a cycle? I have to think about that,\u201d Simeone told a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a logical question for you to ask after a defeat like the one we\u2019ve suffered today. \u201cI feel proud of my players. Quite frankly I love my players. It\u2019s obvious that they\u2019ve given everything that they have, and they always give everything they have. We had the chance to become champions, we didn\u2019t take that chance. \u201cWe need to continue working, I have to think things out on my part. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing now. What is clear to me is that nobody remembers the losers. Losing two finals is a failure. We have to get over this and heal our wounds.\u201d Although he offered his congratulations to Real, Simeone could not hide his disappointment at losing another final in such cruel circumstances. \u201cYou do your best, you try to do what you can, you get to two finals and you lose them both,\u201d he said. \u201cOne you lose 4-1, even though it was 2-1 for a long time, the other you lose on penalties. \u201cThis cycle for me at Atl\u00e9tico, two finals in three years, is actually a marvellous achievement, but I am not happy with what I have achieved.\u201d Atl\u00e9tico won the La Liga title in 2014, breaking Barcelona\u2019s and Real Madrid\u2019s nine-year stranglehold on the trophy.",
