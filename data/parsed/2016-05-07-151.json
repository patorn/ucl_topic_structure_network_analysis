  "body": "Ryan Reynolds, he explains in his advert for BT, is a busy guy. He can\u2019t even sign autographs any more, scrawling a straight line across multiple headshots of himself instead of dedicating three seconds to the devoted fans who make it possible for him to drive the Mercedes C63 he doesn\u2019t have time to park in a technically responsible manner. Reynolds\u2019s is a hectic schedule in which even reading a film script before accepting or dismissing it is too taxing. (Citation: Green Lantern, 2011) What he does make time for, of course, is filming an advert to plug BT\u2019s Infinity broadband service, which needs to be as fast as his lifestyle \u2013 up to 52 megabits per second, for those taking notes. At the nucleus of this advert\u2019s premise lies a troubling question that should haunt us all: just what, exactly, is Ryan Reynolds running from? Perhaps Reynolds fears the silence that would engulf him when alone, away from Hollywood\u2019s white noise and sycophantic applause. He fears that he would hear nought but the voices in his head. \u201cGreen Lantern,\u201d these voices shriek in piercing discord. \u201cGreen Lantern was a mediocre film at best.\u201d",
