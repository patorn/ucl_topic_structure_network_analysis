  "body": "The Coalition says Labor has created a $66bn \u201cblack hole\u201d with its spending promise that will grow to $200bn over 10 years.   Related: Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens says election winner faces 'years' of budget repair    It has demanded Labor explain how it\u2019s going to close that hole. Labor reacted angrily, saying the government\u2019s claims are rubbish. It has made its own counterclaims and accused the government of being deliberately misleading. How seriously should we take the government\u2019s claims?  The Coalition has made three main claims about the $66bn and $200bn figures that need to be unpacked. How did it come up with those figures?  It says Labor has promised $30.4bn in spending initiatives over the next four years. It says Labor has blocked \u2013 or is planning to block \u2013 $18.5bn in the Senate. It says Labor will restore $34bn in cuts that the Coalition has made (which the Coalition is calling savings).  It adds those three figures together to get $82.9bn, and then it subtracts $16bn in savings it says Labor has made or pledged.  That gives it $66.9bn, which is stretched over four years. It then uses that $66.9bn figure to make projections for Labor\u2019s spending over the next decade. By doing that, it says Labor\u2019s spending promise will blow out by $198bn within 10 years. Let\u2019s have a look at each claim. Claim 1: \u201cLabor has promised $30.4bn over the next four years.\u201d The majority of numbers in this $30.4bn figure appear to be correct, but there are many that aren\u2019t (we\u2019ve attached the government\u2019s supporting evidence for you to see for yourself).       And the government is criticising Labor, in some instances, for supporting Coalition policies \u2013 such as the small business tax cuts announced in the recent budget \u2013 without saying how it will fund its support for them. It\u2019s all very messy.  The government wants us to focus our attention on this claim because it stacks up the most.   Related: Coalition says 'black hole' calculations include statements that are not Labor policies    In a media conference on Tuesday, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, admitted that Labor\u2019s black hole \u201cwas at least $32bn and as much as $67bn. They are well behind\u201d. Claim 2: \u201cLabor has blocked, or is planning to block, $18.5bn in the Senate.\u201d They\u2019re playing a trick there. See that word \u201cplan\u201d? A plan is something that hasn\u2019t happened yet. It\u2019s something Labor hasn\u2019t committed to. Who knows what Labor\u2019s final plans will be?  By combining the policies that Labor has blocked in the Senate with policies that Labor may or may not block in the Senate, it allows the Coalition to produce a much larger number. In a paper accompanying the announcement, the Coalition lists every measure it says Labor is either blocking or has said it will block, but it doesn\u2019t say which is which. The Coalition\u2019s also assuming that all of those measures should go through the Senate unmolested. Claim 3: \u201cLabor will restore $34bn in cuts the Coalition has made.\u201d This is the most controversial element of the Coalition\u2019s attack, because it has included a huge figure \u2013 $19.27bn \u2013 which Labor is hotly disputing. The Coalition is claiming that Labor has pledged to restore the cuts to foreign aid that the government has made to the tune of $19.27bn. Its evidence? It\u2019s using a quote from the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Tanya Plibersek, from ABC radio on 30 July 2015. Plibersek said in that interview, when asked what Labor would do if re-elected next year, that Labor \u201ccertainly wouldn\u2019t continue with the aid cuts that are scheduled by this government\u201d. She clarified it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to restore the funding in the short term but Labor hoped to do so in the long term. The Coalition has taken that to be a pledge by Labor to restore the cuts completely. On Saturday last weekend, Labor promised to reverse a $224m cut to foreign aid in the 2016 budget, but it did not commit to restore $19bn in foreign aid over 10 years. The shadow finance minister, Tony Burke, reacted angrily on Tuesday to the government\u2019s use of that $19bn figure. \u201cHow much did the treasurer of Australia and the finance minister for Australia want to turn that [$224m] figure into today? They presented a figure of $224m, got out the liquid paper and said \u201cOh look, it\u2019s $19bn\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when asked how could you get it so wrong, they said \u201cBut Labor\u2019s got this policy of getting foreign aid to 0.5% of gross national income so they\u2019ve plugged those numbers in. Forgetting that on their own 2013 election policy documents, they claimed the same thing!\u201d  At any rate, read the document that the government distributed to the media on Tuesday.
