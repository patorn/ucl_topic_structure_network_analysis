  "body": "The Liberal party\u2019s candidate for Fremantle in Western Australia was absent from a press conference with Malcolm Turnbull on Monday after documents revealed that he had misdescribed his work history on his application for preselection. Sherry Sufi, 33, incorrectly described his work experience on his application for endorsement by the Liberal party. The revelation, broken by the West Australian, has thrown Sufi into the national spotlight in the second week of the election campaign, putting pressure on the Liberal party to back its candidate, just as Labor and the Greens had to do in Victoria and New South Wales last week.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, campaigning in Perth on Monday, was asked to explain why Sufi was not campaigning with him, given the city of Perth was so close to Sufi\u2019s seat. Turnbull said he was in Perth to talk about a $282mn contract with Austal to build 19 Pacific patrol boats, which was a national announcement. \u201cI\u2019m the prime minister and I hope he\u2019s out there engaging with the people of Fremantle and doing good door-knocking,\u201d he said. \u201cVery character-building. I\u2019ve done it myself.\u201d He was also asked by reporters whether he supports Sufi\u2019s views on same-sex marriage and the stolen generations. He said he did not believe same-sex marriage would lead to polygamy and he did not agree with Sufi\u2019s view that it would be politically divisive to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution.

Photograph: Facebook    \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that but this is an issue on which there is a wide range of views, but my own view is we should recognise our first Australians in our constitution,\u201d he said. Sufi wrote on his application for preselection \u2013 which has been seen by Guardian Australia \u2013 that he worked as a research officer for the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, when he only worked for WA politicians Liz Behjat and Michael Sutherland. He also said he worked for the Department of Finance and Deregulation when he only worked as a staffer for the the federal Liberal MP Dennis Jensen (who is now running as an independent) and for the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds. In both cases he has named the government department that paid his salary, rather than naming his effective employer. Sufi also says he has affiliations with the Institute of Public Affairs, a rightwing thinktank. Sufi would not answer his phone when contacted by Guardian Australia. Fremantle is held by Labor on a 5.4% margin but its sitting member, Melissa Park, is retiring. The Greens are targeting the seat with candidate Kate Davis. In 2013, Sufi wrote an essay for the Menzies House website arguing that same-sex marriage proponents in Australia were orchestrating a \u201cperfidious and futile attack on language.\u201d   Related: Labor commits to manufacturing jobs boost as Malcolm Turnbull sells defence    \u201cAustralia\u2019s gay marriage movement masquerades as a successor to yesterday\u2019s great social reform movements, but on closer look we find that any such comparison is an insult to the Suffragist and the Civil Rights movements,\u201d his essays said. \u201cIn the years ahead Australians will have to decide whether to preserve an institution that has served them well for many centuries, or to redefine that institution to satisfy a small minority of activists who are already blessed with equal rights.  In the Fremantle Herald last month, Sufi also former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd\u2019s apology to indigenous Australians had achieved little. \u201cRudd\u2019s apology was expected to be a real game changer for race relations in our nation. It has been, except in the opposite direction,\u201d he wrote. \u201cApart from convincing the activists they can pretty much get anything they want provided they make sufficient noise, it has achieved little else.\u201d",
