  "body": "France\u2019s CGT trade union has been accused of a \u201cscandalous\u201d attempt to lean on the press after it prevented almost all of Thursday\u2019s French national newspapers from being printed, as part of escalating nationwide strike action against the government\u2019s changes to labour laws. The union\u2019s strikers shut off printing presses and distribution and allowed only one newspaper, the leftwing daily L\u2019Humanit\u00e9, to be printed after it agreed to the union\u2019s demands to publish an opinion piece by the CGT leader, Philippe Martinez. This sparked accusations from newspaper editors of a \u201cshameful\u201d attempt to pressure the media.  It has emerged that CGT representatives contacted the French newspaper editors\u2019 union on Wednesday, saying they insisted that every daily paper run a pre-written communique by Martinez, in which he called for the government proposalsto be abandoned.    Related: Union revolt puts both Hollande's future and France's image on the line    L\u2019Humanit\u00e9, which was formerly the official publication of the French Communist party and which, although it has long been independent, retains strong ties to its political roots, was the only paper to publish the release.  All other daily papers were prevented from publishing by the union, which shut off the printing presses on Wednesday night.    \u201cThe CGT has decided to block the printing of newspapers who refused to publish, under constraint, a tract calling for the government to withdraw its labour laws,\u201d said Nicolas Beytout owner of L\u2019Opinion daily, in an online editorial. \u201cThis scandalous intrusion by the union into the content of the media must be denounced as a deplorable attack on democracy,\u201d he added.  Laurent Joffrin, the editor of the left-leaning daily Lib\u00e9ration told France Inter radio: \u201cWe\u2019ve never published a communique under pressure and we never will.\u201d He denounced a \u201cshameful and stupid\u201d demand by the CGT.    Related: France fuel strike leads to tourist anxiety ahead of bank holiday weekend    Didier Lourdez, from CGT, told France Inter that the union had made \u201cno demand, no diktat\u201d but that the CGT had proposed that all papers give space to Martinez\u2019s communique. \u201cThe freedom of the press and democracy have to work in both senses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s us who are being held hostage by the government which wants to apply this law.\u201d The newspaper editors\u2019 union, the Syndicat de la Presse Quotidienne Nationale, said in a statement that newspapers were being held hostage by the union in a political dispute with the government that had nothing to do with newspapers. \u201cOur readers are the victims,\u201d the statement said. During the last two months of protests against the law, newspapers have been stopped from printing and distributing on two previous occasions in March and April.  All French national papers were available free online on Thursday.",
