  "body": "Mario Balotelli is heading back to Liverpool after Milan confirmed they would not keep the misfit striker. The 25-year-old has been on loan at the San Siro this season but has failed to impress and did not make Italy\u2019s Euro 2016 squad. The Rossoneri welcomed Balotelli back last summer but, after just one goal in 20 appearances, and with Milan failing to secure a place in the Champions League, the former Manchester City forward looks set for a return to England. The Milan president, Silvio Berlusconi, said: \u201cThere will be several departures as the likes of Alex, [Philippe] Mexes, [Kevin-Prince] Boateng and Balotelli all have deals that will expire.\u201d The news will come as a disappointment for Balotelli who had hoped to secure a permanent move back to Italy. Last month he said: \u201cWhen it comes to my future I want to stay with Milan because I wasn\u2019t happy at Liverpool and I don\u2019t want to return there. And plus, Milan has the money. I\u2019ve been doing well in my last two games, there are another six for me to prove myself. I feel in good shape physically at last and am relaxed.\u201d   Related: Premier League finances: the full club-by-club breakdown and verdict    Liverpool paid \u00a316m for Balotelli in August 2014 but, in his one season at Anfield he scored four goals in 28 matches, including only one in the Premier League. The manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp is keen to offload him and there have already been inquiries from the Chinese Super League. His agent, Mino Raiola, has sounded out potential suitors for the troubled forward and clubs in China and Turkey have expressed a firm interest. The Chinese Super League outspent the Premier League in January and that expenditure, following a declaration by the president, Xi Jingping, that China should become a football powerhouse, has prompted agents such as Raiola and Pini Zahavi to explore further deals for the summer.",
