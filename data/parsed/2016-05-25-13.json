  "body": "1 Sign players with Championship experience Fulham\u2019s Ross McCormack could not stop scoring \u2013 or creating \u2013 goals for a struggling side last season and as a deep-lying, wonderfully thoughtful forward he would be an ideal fit for Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s preferred 4-2-3-1 system. Then there is Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s Beram Kayal, a very good central midfielder and a strong character who knows how to tackle. The Israel international could prove an ideal replacement for Cheik Tiot\u00e9. A left-back is urgently required so, should Hull City miss out on promotion, Andrew Robertson could fill a long-standing problem position at St James\u2019 Park before looking right at home in the top tier. Ben\u00edtez wants recruits who can help minimise the culture shock of the Championship for his newly relegated and mostly foreign team-mates, while providing the starting XI with a solid framework. He suspects Norwich City, bolstered by a nucleus of British players, may also be challenging for top spot and does not underestimate Aston Villa\u2019s potential for reinvention but is determined to ensure Newcastle are a cut above the rest. With Graham Carr set to retire from his once-powerful position as chief scout, the characters of potential newcomers should become more important than their propensity for fancy footwork, and the scrapping of the club rule barring the acquisition of players aged over 26 finally permits the introduction of some much-needed street-wise experience.  Love it or list it We are talking Newcastle\u2019s training ground in the suburb of Benton. Ben\u00edtez could do with some help from Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer, the presenters of the Channel\u00a04 property show in which Kirstie teaches home owners how to revamp a tired house and Phil attempts to persuade them to\u00a0move. A poor relation to Middlesbrough\u2019s and Sunderland\u2019s training grounds, Newcastle\u2019s base is cramped, dated, rundown and not exactly cutting edge. The Benton site is big enough to be radically redeveloped \u2013 and Ben\u00edtez is already drawing up plans \u2013 but what about Woolsington Hall? Situated amid green fields alongside Newcastle airport, it was originally envisaged by Sir John Hall as the squad\u2019s headquarters and the land remains undeveloped. Why not revive that grand vision and build a state-of-the-art base adjacent to a five-star luxury hotel, akin to Middlesbrough\u2019s partnership with the popular Rockliffe Hall near Darlington? Most Newcastle players live within a 10-minute drive of Woolsington so it could be a big selling point.  Choose wisely who to keep, and who to move on Ben\u00edtez wants to keep his better individuals but may struggle to hold on to arguably the team\u2019s brightest spark, England\u2019s Andros Townsend. Moussa Sissoko, Gini Wijnaldum and Daryl Janmaat seem eager to depart but may not be allowed to leave too easily. The manager should be able to keep hold of Chancel Mbemba, Vurnon Anita, Jamaal Lascelles, Jack Colback, Paul Dummett, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ayoze P\u00e9rez who, complemented by the right additions, could be effective at second-tier level. Then there is young Adam Armstrong, back in the attacking ranks after scoring freely for Coventry in League One. 4 Improve the dressing-room chemistry The shocking tackle of Mitrovic on Tottenham\u2019s Kyle Walker, for which he was sent off, served as a reminder that he is not a striker you can necessarily trust, so Ben\u00edtez possibly has a big decision to make over the Serb\u2019s future. Last season the dressing room proved a divided place with the sizeable contingent of Francophone players forming their own clique. It helps that Ben\u00edtez speaks French, but might moving on players such as Tiot\u00e9, Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and Sissoko create a better balance? And what to do about Fabricio Coloccini? The frequently injured centre-half has a year remaining on his \u00a360,000-a-week contract but seemed unhappy this past season, when he hardly helped Steve McClaren\u2019s cause. Might it be worth paying up his contract? 5 Ease the congestion in the treatment room Newcastle may have spent virtually the entire campaign in the bottom three but, for months on end, they topped the Premier League injury charts compiled by Physioroom.com. Sometimes an entire team queued up on the sidelines, leaving McClaren and Ben\u00edtez lacking a left\u2011back at vital moments. Worryingly, most of the problems were soft-tissue injuries \u2013 Newcastle players pull an awful lot of hamstrings \u2013 rather than impact wounds. Small wonder the Spaniard is anxious to conduct a full review of the medical department and conditioning procedures. Rolando Aarons, a bright young winger, caught the eye as a substitute during the 5-1 deconstruction of Tottenham but his progress has been thwarted by far too many hamstring issues. Kevin Mbabu, a promising young defender, has likewise spent far more time on the treatment table than the pitch, and Steven Taylor \u2013 whose contract has ended and who may be released \u2013 has been continually sidelined, along with Massadio Ha\u00efdara. It has not been lost on Ben\u00edtez that one of the reasons Sunderland escaped relegation was their consistently fit squad and a negligible number of soft\u2011tissue complaints. 6 Breathe new life into the academy Newcastle\u2019s under-21 and under-18 sides struggled last season, highlighting the lack of young players bridging the chasm between the junior ranks and the first team. Ben\u00edtez, whose overhaul of Liverpool\u2019s academy has paid dividends, is keen to oversee similar root-and-branch reform of junior scouting and coaching. 7 Do homework on the new Championship opponents Having secured promotions with Extremadura and Tenerife early in his managerial career, Ben\u00edtez is not fazed by the second tier. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the Premier League or the Championship, a coach\u2019s job doesn\u2019t change too much,\u201d he says. Even so, he has made a point of watching the play-offs and is analysing a stylistically surprisingly eclectic division which variously features David Wagner\u2019s Klopp-lite version of gegenpressing at Huddersfield, Brentford\u2019s obsession with analytics and the madness of life under Massimo Cellino \u2013 who makes Mike Ashley look like a poodle \u2013 at Leeds\u00a0United.
