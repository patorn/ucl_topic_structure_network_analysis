  "body": "When Diane Morgan graduated from the East 15 drama school in Essex, she couldn\u2019t find acting work, and nor could her friend Maxine Peake. They decided the problem was their northern accents, so got elocution lessons. \u201cMaxine got into Rada,\u201d recalls Morgan, \u201cthen got cast in Victoria Wood\u2019s Dinnerladies, and got a South Bank Show made about her. I couldn\u2019t get arrested.\u201d Was she jealous? \u201cYeah, but I couldn\u2019t take her entirely seriously. I was laughing when she played Myra Hindley.\u201d Morgan knew she couldn\u2019t do what Peake had done and become a straight actor. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to make people laugh,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been my only ambition, ever since my dad introduced me to the genius of the great comedians: Tony Hancock, Woody Allen, people like that. While other kids were into New Kids on the Block, I was into Harold Lloyd and Stan Laurel. I\u2019m still like that. I don\u2019t have any hobbies.\u201d Morgan went back north and, apart from a small role as Dawn in fellow Boltonian Peter Kay\u2019s Phoenix Nights, still didn\u2019t trouble the casting directors. Instead, she peeled spuds at a Bolton chip shop called Le Chipperie, packed worming tablets in a factory, and did time as an Avon lady. While working as a dental nurse, she inadvertently knocked some bloke\u2019s front tooth out.   Related: Philomena Cunk: \u2018Shakespeare has more Henrys than a Hoover showroom\u2019    And then she found her niche \u2013 in telesales. \u201cI was ringing people up to ask if they were happy with their accountancy services,\u201d she recalls grimly. \u201cPeople were like: \u2018I got out the fucking bath for this?\u2019 Her boss noticed that, after such dismal phone calls, she had quite the way with a laconic one-liner. \u201cYou should become a standup,\u201d he told her. \u201cI was nearly 30 and wondered what would happen to me if I didn\u2019t chance it. So I followed my boss\u2019s advice.\u201d For once, telesales have been good for something. With her gags about break-ups, singledom and wedding etiquette, Morgan quickly established herself on the circuit. She met Joe Wilkinson and they formed a double act. \u201cI still think he\u2019s the funniest person I know. We were united by hating standup.\u201d What did she hate? \u201cAudiences. Hecklers. Getting knocked off your stride.\u201d So the pair developed a sketch show, Two Episodes of Mash, that did well at Edinburgh for three years from 2008. One pleasure was that she was being someone else. \u201cI\u2019m always happier when playing a role.\u201d The BBC showed an interest. \u201cWe did a pilot and they took three years to reject it. I guess there are fashions in sketch shows.\u201d She does concede, however, that the material could be a little abstruse. \u201cWe had one sketch where Joe lost his peregrine falcon. It was hilarious but it didn\u2019t really go anywhere.\u201d And then she auditioned for the part that has made her famous: professional TV dimwit Philomena Cunk, whose investigations are a highlight of Charlie Brooker\u2019s Weekly Wipe series on BBC2. As Cunk she has investigated the vexing issues of our day: how time works, what feminism is, and why everyone goes on about Winston Churchill and/or Breaking Bad. \u201cCharlie had envisaged Cunk as posh but thick,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cWhat he definitely didn\u2019t want was someone with a regional accent because that would be like saying you\u2019re thick if you\u2019ve got a regional accent.\u201d When Morgan auditioned, though, she asked if she could perform in her native Bolton accent. Suddenly Cunk \u2013 with her Marty Feldman eyes, Ena Sharples surliness, Stacey Dooley imperturbability and Lancastrian vowels \u2013 was born.           Philomena Cunk: \u2018Did Shakespeare make up the word bumbaclart?\u2019    Cunk\u2019s interviews with experts are excruciating car crashes akin to the time Ali G asked Noam Chomsky how many words he knew. And, while her reports to camera look and sound like the work of learned TV presenters, they reveal her to be a wide-eyed simpleton trapped in philosophical puzzles of her own making. \u201cThis is the famous Marillion Line,\u201d Cunk explained as she reported from Greenwich. \u201cNamed after the band Marillion. Who were named after this line.\u201d So what\u2019s the point of Philomena Cunk? \u201cWe\u2019re sending up all the moves of TV presenters: the earnest expressions, the white gloves, sobbing over the manuscripts, all that \u2013 through the prism of someone who\u2019s very dim.\u201d Cunk can be insightful, though, albeit unwittingly. Here she is on Benefits Street: \u201cThey weren\u2019t claiming benefits like MPs do, but a different type of benefits that they weren\u2019t entitled to, because they were poor.\u201d Now Cunk is investigating Shakespeare. She asks the big question: \u201cDid Shakespeare write boring gibberish with no relevance to our world of Tinder and peri-peri fries \u2013 or does it just look, sound and feel that way?\u201d She interviews experts \u2013 actor Simon Russell Beale and director Iqbal Khan among them \u2013 and finds that the Swan of Avon was more than \u201cjust a bald man who wrote with feathers\u201d. There had been doubts that Cunk could sustain the gag for 30 minutes, but the show works, not least because it satirises the structure of a hosted BBC history documentary. \u201cI have to go on a journey,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cEverybody doing this kind of programme does. It\u2019s the law.\u201d Morgan revels in the role. \u201cIt\u2019s like wearing a suit of armour. If you\u2019re Cunk, nothing can harm you. I can say anything and it\u2019s fun. I have absolutely no social skills. I love creating awkward moments.\u201d For instance, Cunk argues with Paul Taylor, head of collections at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, when he fails to provide her with white gloves for examining a First Folio. \u201cSimon Schama gets to wear gloves,\u201d moans Cunk. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t get to wear them here,\u201d snaps Taylor. Morgan claims to be channelling the spirit of fellow Lancastrian Stan Laurel, who \u201cwould just sit happy in his own world\u201d. She recalls the scene in which Stan visits Ollie in hospital and eats a boiled egg, oblivious to Ollie\u2019s mounting fury. That sort of obliviousness is what Morgan courts. And she realises it best as Cunk. Is Cunk a role model? \u201cWell, she\u2019s not bothered about pleasing, which is a relief.\u201d   Related: 'Where is the money in a coin?': five times Philomena Cunk blew our minds    I was afraid that Morgan, now 40, would be as surly and unfeeling as Cunk. After all, there is an overlap: as evidenced by her recent appearances on such panel shows as Have I Got News For You, Morgan\u2019s humour is deadpan, terse and eviscerating, her gaze implacable, her smiles rare. But she\u2019s much better company in person. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do many panel shows,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a comic actor, not a comedian. There would be something wrong in Steve Coogan or Julia Davis doing panel shows all the time.\u201d Later this year, Morgan will appear in Motherland, a BBC sitcom about modern maternity by Catastrophe writer and star Sharon Horgan, comedian Holly Walsh, Father Ted writer Graham Linehan and his wife, Helen. \u201cThere are three mothers. I play the bad one who has no bond with her children at all. Typecasting \u2013 I don\u2019t like kids.\u201d Morgan is also about to be seen in Rovers, Craig Cash\u2019s Sky sitcom about the lives and loves of a rubbish football team, Redbridge Rovers FC. Morgan stars alongside Sue Johnston and Joe Wilkinson. \u201cI play Mandy, who\u2019s a goth slag and a plumber.\u201d One of the great pleasures for Morgan has been seeing Johnston at work. \u201cShe gives a masterclass in poignant acting. There\u2019s one bit where she wants to go up the Shard but realises she never will. I was crying my eyes out.\u201d Doesn\u2019t she yearn to play poignant roles like that? \u201cNah. I\u2019m happy doing what I\u2019m doing. I do think, though, there were great comic actors like Thora Hird and Max Wall who only got taken seriously when they did straight roles at the end of their careers.\u201d Would you like to emulate them? \u201cMaybe. But it\u2019s as though the comedy wasn\u2019t worth the attention. But it was.\u201d So where is your career going? \u201cTo the dogs,\u201d she laughs. \u201c I\u2019m grateful to get work, after all the shit jobs. I\u2019m glad to just get out of the house.\u201d \u2022 Cunk on Shakespeare is on BBC2 on Wednesday 11 May at 10pm \u2022 This article was amended on 12 May 2016.
