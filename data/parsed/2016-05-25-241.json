  "body": "Despite having been the chief executive of Google for 10 years where he oversaw the launch of Android, and now the executive chairman of Google\u2019s holding company Alphabet, Eric Schmidt uses an iPhone. Schmidt revealed at Startup Europe Fest in Amsterdam, where he shared the stage with Apple\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook, that he was an iPhone user, much to the audience\u2019s amusement. Schmidt tried to save the day saying that he also has a Samsung Galaxy smartphone \u2013 again not a phone made by Google, but at least it\u2019s an Android device: \u201cThe Samsung is better, has a better battery. Are we clear? And to those of you who are iPhone users, I\u2019m right!\u201d When an audience show of hands revealed more people had an iPhone than an Android, Schmidt said pointedly: \u201cSo much for the Android monopoly in Europe.\u201d Whether Schmidt has a personal dislike for the devices and operating system his company creates is unclear. As late as 2014 Schmidt was spotted using a BlackBerry, because he \u201cliked the keyboard\u201d. Did he switch from a BlackBerry to an iPhone? Surely that can\u2019t have coincided with BlackBerrys recent switch to Android.
