  "body": "When Barack Obama meets her on Wednesday in the city of Flint, Michigan, Amariyanna \u201cMari\u201d Copeny has an agenda. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give him a big hug and say what more can I do to help?\u201d Copeny said on Monday. In March, Copeny \u2013 known around the Rust Belt city as \u201cLittle Miss Flint\u201d \u2013 sought a few minutes of Obama\u2019s time, as she was headed to Washington DC by bus for a congressional hearing about her hometown\u2019s two-year water crisis. The hearing featured testimony from the Michigan governor, Rick Snyder, on his administration\u2019s response to the city\u2019s lead contamination problem. \u201cMy mom said chances are you will be too busy with more important things,\u201d Mari wrote at the time, \u201cbut there is a lot of people coming on these buses and even just a meeting from you or your wife would really lift people\u2019s spirits.\u201d There wasn\u2019t an immediate reply. But that changed last week, when Mari\u2019s mother, Loui \u201cLulu\u201d Brezzell, received a call, notifying her that Obama was so moved by her daughter\u2019s letter that he planned to pen a personal response. The next day, Brezzell received a follow-up call: actually, the president was headed to Michigan \u2013 and he wanted to meet Mari. Now, Little Miss Flint is the busiest third-grader in town: on Monday alone, she handled interview requests from more than a half dozen news outlets ahead of Obama\u2019s visit, and even met with Flint\u2019s congressional representative, Dan Kildee.  \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d she said, as laconically as one would expect of an eight-year-old who spent a day running around town in meetings. Mari\u2019s face time with Obama comes just over two years after Flint switched its water source to a local river, a decision with a disastrous, long-lasting impact, as state environmental officials didn\u2019t require the city to treat the new supply with corrosion control agents. The regulatory failure allowed the corrosive water to leach lead off pipes before flowing into households across the city.     Mari Copeny visited Washington amid Flint\u2019s water crisis. Photograph: Courtesy Loui Brezzell    Despite being told the water would be safe to drink, Brezzell said, she immediately stocked up on bottled water; the dirty reputation of the Flint river was enough to convince her otherwise. \u201cWe knew the treatment plant had not been used in so long,\u201d Brezzell, 26, said. \u201cAnd the river doesn\u2019t always have the best stories told about it so we kind of didn\u2019t trust its reputation.\u201d Still, Brezzell\u2019s family continued to cook and bathe with the water, sometimes using it to make Kool-Aid. When Flint switched back to using Lake Huron water last October, Brezzell and her children started breaking out with irritating splotches on their skin.  \u201cWe started getting rashes similar to chemical burns,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the switch, back when they started dumping all this stuff in to recoat the pipes, that\u2019s when we started having all the issues.\u201d Standing outside Kildee\u2019s local office in Flint, Brezzell showed a series of photos, showcasing the spots and bumps across her family\u2019s skin. \u201cWhen I say it looks like chemical burns?\u201d she said, pointing to the photos. \u201cYeah, it gets bad.\u201d The family, like many in Flint, is confined to using bottled water. Officials have yet to say when the city\u2019s water supply will be safe to drink without a filter. Brezzell said her kids still bathe at home \u2013 \u201cWe speed-shower: two minutes, in and out\u201d \u2013 and then they\u2019re rinsed off with donated bottled water. \u201cMy skin, it\u2019s terrible, her skin, my two younger ones with their skin,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d But the surprise announcement from Obama has been a welcome event for Mari, who\u2019s often seen at rallies donning a sash and wearing a tiara \u2013 a testament to her love for competing in pageants since she was a toddler. She likes to play the violin, watch television and, of course, eat candy. One day, she hopes to become Miss America and, later, a police officer, following in the footsteps of her \u201cBFF\u201d, former Flint police chief James Tolbert. \u201cThey\u2019ve been super, super close since last summer,\u201d Brezzell said. \u201cThe day we had to tell her that [Flint mayor Karen] Weaver fired him, she broke down in tears. I posted a picture online; it got back to Tolbert, and the other cops, they sent one of their police K-9 units over with a teddy bear to try to make her feel better.\u201d Mari\u2019s meeting with Obama won\u2019t be all about Flint, though. She also intends to lighten the conversation with a simple question. \u201cHow many dogs do you have?\u201d she said, gleaming with a warm smile. Brezzell laughed: \u201cYeah, she loves dogs.\u201d",
