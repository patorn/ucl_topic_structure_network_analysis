In the mid-90s when the game was turning professional he thought the recipe for nirvana was easy: sign up a few big names, recruit an alpha-male coach and watch the titles and the crowds pour in. Twenty years and tens of millions of pounds later he has learned the hard way that sporting fulfilment is significantly trickier to engineer. If he has one slice of advice for others, as his beloved club seek to become the first English side since 2004 to claim a domestic and European double, it is this: the quality of the players ultimately matters less than their calibre as human beings. \u201cIt took me a long time to understand that everything is about good people first and foremost,\u201d says Wray, reflecting on Saracens\u2019 odyssey from the park pitch at Bramley Road in Southgate to the Grand Stade de Lyon. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the people right you won\u2019t get anything right. In one way it\u2019s amazing what we\u2019ve achieved. In another way I\u2019m amazed it\u2019s taken so long.\u201d   Related: Three ways Saracens can beat Racing 92 to claim Champions Cup crown | Dean Ryan    Talk to anyone at Saracens from Wray downwards before their Champions Cup final against Racing 92 and they will also suggest this weekend may simply be the start. Two years ago they lost a brace of bruising finals to Toulon and Northampton within eight days and the pain of that double whammy was not entirely eased by last year\u2019s Premiership title. \u201cI think there are going to be many more finals and semi-finals,\u201d says Wray, echoing his director of rugby Mark McCall\u2019s prediction this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still all got to be done but these young guys could still be playing together in five years\u2019 time. It is amazing what they could achieve.\u201d There is an underlying narrative here, though, that goes far beyond the potential of Maro Itoje, Owen Farrell, Billy Vunipola, George Kruis et al, beyond Wray\u2019s enduring faith \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m one of the most impatient patient people I know\u201d \u2013 and beyond even the South African financial backing that has cushioned the club\u2019s heavy annual losses. Saracens have always been enthusiastic disciples of north American sporting trends but it is an academic study investigating the success \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 of franchises in professional basketball over a 30-year period that best explains the club\u2019s latest surge. The forwards coach, Alex Sanderson, mentioned it again the other day, pointing out similar principles apply in professional rugby and the NBA: \u201cThe winners weren\u2019t the teams with the best players, they were the teams that stayed together the longest and built [lasting] relationships.\u201d Sanderson sees similarities with the Wasps side who won two Heineken Cups in 2004 and 2007, the last time an English club conquered Europe: \u201cIf you look at our squad, with an average age of 24 or 25, it looks similar to that Wasps side with Lawrence Dallaglio, Joe Worsley and Josh Lewsey. They kept that squad together for a long time. \u201cOur performance director, Phil Morrow, has a graph about performance in a club environment. You\u2019ve got your young lads who are still progressing, then your England players at the top of this bell-shaped curve, then your 30 year olds, who aren\u2019t getting stronger in the gym and aren\u2019t as driven as those guys in the performance bracket. Our Six Nations guys have been really driving both the other two groups since they came back.\u201d The fact Saracens have lost only four times all season also highlights the worth of loyal servants such as Brad Barritt, Charlie Hodgson, Schalk Brits, Chris Wyles, Jackson Wray and Petrus du Plessis, who drive the culture even when they are not starting games. Wyles confirms this continuity has been central to the club\u2019s success: \u201cProbably the biggest factor in our success to date has been the consistency of squad and coaches. There\u2019s a big group of guys here I\u2019ve played with for seven or eight years.\u201d He also argues the much-publicised bonding trips abroad and imminent arrival of big names such as Schalk Burger remain secondary to the core values of humility and employee empowerment originally laid down under Brendan Venter and Edward Griffiths. The American international still shakes his head at Venter\u2019s inspirational powers. \u201cHe was unbelievable at motivating players \u2026 guys would run through brick walls for him. He was a force of nature and the foundations he laid are still in place seven years on.\u201d Despite the fact Venter, Griffiths, Paul Gustard, Steve Borthwick, Andy Farrell, Hugh Vyvyan, Mouritz Botha, David Strettle and others have all moved on, progress has been largely unaffected. \u201cI do feel that if we stick to the formula we have this club can continue to grow,\u201d Wyles adds. It is persuasive stuff, particularly when blended with the \u201cwolf pack\u201d defensive fervour, an increased willingness to run back ball through Alex Goode and Chris Ashton and McCall\u2019s sharp tactical ability. Racing, clearly, have impressive individuals but it is Saracens\u2019 cohesive whole that powers everything they do. The Wasps comparison is a fair one: for Dallaglio, Simon Shaw, Alex King and Fraser Waters read Vunipola, Kruis, Farrell and Barritt. In Dallaglio\u2019s opinion, though, previous defeats are not always compulsory: \u201cI lean towards the school that you can come into a final and win it first up. You don\u2019t have to have lost games to do that. When you\u2019ve got players like Maxime Machenaud and Dan Carter in your team you\u2019re going to have a very good chance.\u201d True enough. Few know more than Dallaglio, who will be back at Twickenham this month on promotional duties at the HSBC London Sevens, about grasping a European and domestic double in the month of May. \u201cI remember saying: \u2018We\u2019ve won the cake but the cake won\u2019t taste as good without the icing on it as well.\u2019 Winning one gives you the swagger and belief to win the other. You can\u2019t go into a Premiership final as European champions and lose, it\u2019s a simple as that.\u201d So can Saracens seal the deal? Wray is rightly hopeful but is all too aware table-toppers do not always become champions. \u201cImagine saying to Leicester City: \u2018Well done on finishing top, boys, you\u2019re now playing off against Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester City to see who wins the league.\u2019 There\u2019d be a riot. I don\u2019t agree with it but we all knew what the rules were.\u201d Neither is this European weekend any kind of certainty but Saracens have not come this far to squander such a huge opportunity. One last push and the old paupers of Bramley Road will be the new kings of Lyon.",
