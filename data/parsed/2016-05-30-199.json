  "body": "Two women have been attacked by a kangaroo while cycling in South Australia\u2019s wine country. Sharon Heinrich, 45, suffered cracked ribs and internal injuries while Helen Salter, 47, was concussed after being attacked along the Riesling Trail in Clare Valley.  \u201cJust out of the corner of my eye I\u2019ve seen this kangaroo up on this ledge. I thought \u2018he\u2019s cute\u2019 ... and then he jumped on top of me and used me to launch off and on to my girlfriend,\u201d Heinrich said.       \u201cWe flew probably one-and-a-half metres after he hit us. I was on the ground and couldn\u2019t breathe for about 10 minutes. I couldn\u2019t talk,\u201d she said. \u201cHelen got up and she stayed with me until I could breathe, got on my bike and rode to a business about half a kilometre away [at Penwortham].\u201d Heinrich believed the kangaroo was a male buck, judging by its size. \u201cI\u2019m 5ft 4in and he was taller than me, and so heavy,\u201d she told the Northern Argus newspaper. \u201cOnce he landed on me, he used me to launch off again, which caused more damage.\u201d Heinrich, who lives in the region, said she would require surgery to fix the injuries.   hh   \u201cWhen the surgeon saw me in Adelaide he said I was lucky to be alive \u2013 kangaroos are solid muscle and incredibly powerful,\u201d she told the Argus. \u201cWhen he landed he went completely through me, if he had become caught in the bike the outcome would be a lot different.\u201d Attacks by kangaroos on humans are extremely rare. But Guy Ballard, of the University of New England in Armidale, has researched the interaction of people and wildlife in Australia and said the distinction between human and animal territory was becoming blurred.  \u201cThe people live on the edge of rural land, and the kangaroos want to take advantage of natural resources like green grass and water,\u201d he told National Geographic this year. \u201cPeople need to give animals their space. But that\u2019s hard if you come around the corner of your house and there\u2019s one right in front of you.\u201d   Related: Young Australian describes vicious attack by two kangaroos    Heinrich and Salter, who both work at a local nursing home, paid tribute to passersby who helped raise the alarm. But Heinrich warned that tourists should be made more aware of the danger of kangaroos along the popular trail. \u201cI really think there needs to be signs placed along the trail to warn people about them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey jump without warning and at the last minute \u2013 people need to be careful.\u201d",
