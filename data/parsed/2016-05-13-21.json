  "body": "As Mauricio Pochettino seeks to knock Arsenal off their perch, his choice of lunch companion on Tuesday was appropriate and enlightening. Sir Alex Ferguson rated the manner in which he wrested supremacy from Liverpool as one of his finest achievements at Manchester United. For Pochettino, their meal together at Scott\u2019s in Mayfair was not only a \u201cdream come true\u201d but an \u201cinspiration\u201d. One of the principal storylines of the final day of the Premier League season concerns whether Pochettino and Tottenham Hotspur can finish above Arsenal, in second place. They need a point at relegated Newcastle United to make sure and it will probably be required as Arsenal have to be favourites to beat the similarly Championship-bound Aston Villa at Emirates Stadium.

A few weeks back it had been a straight fight between Leicester City and Tottenham to finish in first. But, following draws with West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea and a defeat against Southampton, Tottenham have raised the prospect of finishing third in a two-horse race. It is a big deal to the club\u2019s fans to finish above Arsenal and Pochettino accepted that it would provide an emotional lift. \u201cI recognise it would be a fantastic thing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor our supporters, for us and for the players.\u201d But Pochettino has broader goals and he made it clear that they take in much more than neighbourhood supremacy. If that is a product of being on top, then all well and good. But the priority was simply to be on top. \u201cIf it\u2019s impossible to be first we need to try to be second,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI don\u2019t care which is the club that fights with us. The supporters and their feelings are very important but we are professional and to move on, we sometimes need to put the emotions out. I want to be second not because we\u2019ll be above our enemy but because we are ambitious. It\u2019s fantastic to create and go our own way, because our objectives for the next few seasons are to fight for the title.\u201d There was a time when Ferguson v Wenger was the pre-eminent rivalry in English football and it might have been a topical subject for Pochettino at Scott\u2019s. We will never know because the Tottenham manager, unsurprisingly, refused to reveal any of the juicy details. What shone through, however, was how Pochettino drank in rather more than the \u00a3114 bottle of Brunello di Montalcino (2011). He said, with a smile, that he had only one glass and it was his assistant, Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez, who drank the rest. P\u00e9rez had organised the meal and paid the bill. \u201cMyself and Sir Alex spoke, and Jes\u00fas drank,\u201d Pochettino laughed, and P\u00e9rez did not disagree. \u201cI learned many things. It was two hours and it was very emotional. Every word, every sentence he told us, was a big lesson. \u201cOf course, it can help me to become a better manager. You can read books but there he was in front of us, with his charisma and personality. You understand why he is Sir Alex Ferguson.

When I started my career as a manager, he was always my inspiration, my reference, and when you can share two hours with a person who, for me, was the greatest manager in the world and the history of football, you can only enjoy it. I wanted to stop time but it was impossible.\u201d Pochettino and P\u00e9rez had bumped into Ferguson at the League Managers Association\u2019s president\u2019s dinner in March and they resolved to do lunch, when time permitted. \u201cWe had a short chat at the LMA dinner and we both said, and Jes\u00fas, that it would be good to meet one day,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cBoth of us were interested to know each other.\u201d Ferguson has described Pochettino as the best manager in the league and although the Argentinian signed a new five-year contract at Tottenham on Thursday, it is plain that he is on Ferguson\u2019s radar \u2013 and, by extension, that of United. Pochettino has invited Ferguson to visit him at Tottenham and he said that the Scot \u201cwould like to come\u201d. He also said that they had laughed at an old story in the media which had asked whether Pochettino would become the new Ferguson at Espanyol \u2013 his first job in management. Pochettino\u2019s new contract at Spurs features a change in his title from head coach to manager which, he said, better reflects the scope of his work. He talked about the need to improve the squad for next season, when Champions League football will present a new challenge, and how there was money to spend. Progress, though, can come via other avenues. \u201cWe need to improve our mental state next season,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cAlways, we have been better than our opponents but it\u2019s not always about playing well. You need to manage the mental side. We need to cross this line.\u201d First of all, Pochettino and Tottenham need to cross it ahead of Arsenal.",
