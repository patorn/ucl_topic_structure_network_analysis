  "body": "In a new series, starting tomorrow on Channel 4, the Turner prizewinning artist Grayson Perry explores what masculinity means today.  A self-described sissy, he enters three ultra-male arenas (the first is cage fighting) to explore what is expected of British men. He has a unique view on his own tribe, and raises interesting questions about what it means to be a man in the modern world. We want to hear whether you feel there are certain expectations you must live up to as man. Do you, like Perry, feel someone such as Bear Grylls celebrates a form of masculinity that is now useless? Have men been missold an ideal of masculinity that is a hangover from a more violent age? What do you think when someone tells you to \u201cman up\u201d? Do you think the gender expectations on men are positive or negative, and how have they influenced your life, health and happiness? And have they changed during your lifetime? Tell us by filling in the form below.",
