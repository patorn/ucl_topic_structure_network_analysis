  "body": "Roy Hodgson has admitted it would be a gamble to include Daniel Sturridge in his final 23 for the European Championship but the England manager seems minded to take that risk. Whereas Hodgson is prepared to give Sturridge the benefit of the doubt, he has told Fabian Delph it is virtually certain there will be no place for the midfielder in his final squad after the Manchester City player sustained a groin injury. Sturridge has been unable to train since joining up with England because of a calf problem, clearing the way for Marcus Rashford to make his England debut against Australia at Sunderland on Friday night, with Jamie Vardy temporarily absent and Harry Kane rested. However, Hodgson will leave a decision on the Liverpool forward\u2019s place in his travelling party for France until the last moment before Tuesday\u2019s midnight deadline and has indicated he will take him. \u201cI can\u2019t deny we\u2019re taking a player with a really unfortunate injury record but Daniel worked very hard to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately he\u2019s now picked up this calf strain; we\u2019ll assess it tomorrow. He\u2019s basically had it since he joined up and hasn\u2019t been able to train with us so far. If Sturridge is fit he plays but, at the moment Rashford looks like starting against Australia. \u201cI hope I get what I have seen from him playing for Manchester United. Marcus Rashford plays with confidence in his ability, he has qualities such as pace and directness I appreciate and an ability to get behind defences. I\u2019m really excited to see how that pans out on the international stage. I\u2019m confident he will be able to handle it. If he keeps his feet on the ground I\u2019m sure we have a very big player on our hands.\u201d Hodgson hopes Sturridge will be able to play some part in next Thursday\u2019s Wembley friendly against Portugal. Delph became the first England player to fall from Hodgson\u2019s plans. He was left behind in Manchester as England travelled to their overnight base in Gateshead on Friday. While Hodgson said the midfielder \u201cunderstood\u201d the situation, he wants to avoid holding \u201cdifficult conversations\u201d with those players he must exclude before deciding on the 23 who will cross the channel. \u201cI want to keep my powder dry,\u201d he said. Sunderland is a chance for \u201ctwo or three\u201d fringe contenders to audition for places in the final squad while others are rested. Fraser Forster, certain to travel as Joe Hart\u2019s deputy, will start in goal while Wayne Rooney - who has no fears about exclusion - will begin on the bench with the plan for him to come on in the second half. The central defender Gary Cahill misses out completely as he is resting after an injection intended to clear up a minor hip complaint but Newcastle United\u2019s Andros Townsend may make an appearance on the wing. Hodgson said Newcastle\u2019s relegation to the Championship should not affect Townsend\u2019s future international chances - \u201cWe\u2019re not that draconian,\u201d said England\u2019s coach - and said he would much rather such \u201ca talent\u201d was playing regularly for Rafa Ben\u00edtez than languishing in Tottenham\u2019s reserves. While Jordan Henderson - another who must prove his fitness - seems earmarked for a significant role on Wearside, the current local hero, Jermain Defoe did not even make England\u2019s long-list and is now on an unwanted holiday. \u201cDefoe went to Canada [to MLS Toronto, before joining Sunderland],\u201d said Hodgson pointedly. \u201cI\u2019m not saying for a minute he doesn\u2019t have the ability but we have other eggs in the basket and we don\u2019t want to break any of those eggs. We\u2019re really looking for players who are more akin to Vardy, Rooney, Sturridge, rather than a player who has made his name as a fox in the box finisher.\u201d   Related: Martin O\u2019Neill defends late call on naming Republic of Ireland squad",
