  "body": "\u201cBrazil is divided,\u201d declared writer-director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho at the Cannes film festival on Wednesday, where his new film, Aquarius, is competing for the Palme d\u2019Or. His comments, made to the Guardian at a press conference for the drama on Wednesday, come a day after the film\u2019s premiere, where the cast and crew used the opportunity to mount a protest against what they describe as a coup. Filho and his team are angered about the the recent impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff, the country\u2019s first female president, who was forced from office, as well as interim president Michel Temer\u2019s controversial decision to abolish Brazil\u2019s culture ministry. Temer has since sought to tamp down the criticism by appointing a culture secretary, but four potential candidates have reported refusing the job.

The film-maker added that the \u201cdramatic divide\u201d Rousseff\u2019s impeachment has brought to Brazil is \u201cterrible\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing out the worst in both sides - particularly the right side,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in congress saying women shouldn\u2019t work because they get pregnant - shocking ideas like that.\u201d \u201cAll this transition is going to be very hurtful for our democracy \u2013 that was hard to get in the first place,\u201d added Sonia Braga, Aquarius\u2019 lead actor. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to lose.\u201d The film features Braga as a fiercely resilient aging music critic eager to remain in her apartment despite developers\u2019 pressure. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called it a \u201ca densely observed and superbly acted portrait of a woman of a certain age.\u201d \u201cIt was very important to take this international platform here to expose what\u2019s happening in Brazil,\u201d Braga said of the red-carpet protest, echoing what Filho said. \u201cBecause of the biased media [in Brazil], and because of what people are feeling, Brazil is divided.\u201d     Protest at Cannes Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/Getty Images    Filho said the demonstration came together following discussions with fellow Brazilian film-makers and producers at the festival.   Related: Aquarius review: rich and mysterious Brazilian story of societal disintegration    \u201cWe liked the idea of doing something,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do something noisy, or something that would be in some way inadequate. So the idea that we decided to go for was: A4 pieces of paper with really short sentences, which expressed what is happening in Brazil. Cannes has many cameras and powerful long lenses, and it worked very beautifully.\u201d Banners, held by cast and crew on the steps of the Palais, and inside the theater by audience members, bore messages such as \u201cBrazil is not a democracy\u201d and \u201cThe world cannot accept this illegitimate government\u201d. The overtly political act was met with loud applause inside the venue. Asked if the seaside town Recife in north-east Brazil, where Aquarius takes place, was meant to come across as a crumbling location, Filho said he\u2019s \u201cnot into apocalyptic portraits.\u201d Said the film-maker: \u201cI think when you\u2019re critical of something, you also have to show its normality and beauty in some way. The city is where I live. It\u2019s far from perfect, but so is Paris.\u201d",
