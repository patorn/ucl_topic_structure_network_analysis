  "body": "\u2022 A review of a concert by Rufus Wainwright at the church of St John at Hackney, London, said that he had dedicated \u201ca musical reading of Thomas More\u2019s The Last Rose of Summer to Prince\u201d. It was the 19th-century Irish poet Thomas Moore who wrote The Last Rose of Summer, not the 16th-century statesman and Catholic martyr Sir Thomas More (\u2018He liked guns and other men\u2019: exuberant Rufus revamps Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets, 28 April, page 34). \u2022 The author of a Notebook column (29 April, page 33) wrote that she had been \u201cfeeling a little guilty about Melania Trump lately, after referring to her derisively as a \u2018Slovakian model\u2019\u201d. Trump, a former model, is not Slovakian. She was born in 1970 in Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia) and became a US citizen in 2006. \u2022 Several readers noticed a mismatch between the clue for 3 down in last Friday\u2019s quick crossword, \u201cGeneral Motors\u2019 German subsidiary (4)\u201d, and the solution required to fit the grid, Opal. The car manufacturer described in the clue, based in R\u00fcsselsheim, Hesse, is Opel, not Opal (No 14,344, 29 April, page 32, G2).",
