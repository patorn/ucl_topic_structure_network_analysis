  "body": "German medic Giulia Enders is on a mission to explain \u201cwhy the gut is so fascinating\u201d. This amusing and delightfully frank primer on our intestines, translated by David\u00a0Shaw, is crammed with amazing biological facts (\u201cthe surface area of our digestive system is about a hundred times greater than the area of our skin\u201d) and anecdotes from the scatological fringes of research: to discover the best position in which to poo, Japanese scientists fed volunteers luminescent substances then x-rayed them as they did their business. (Squatting, not sitting on the loo, is the easiest on the intestinal tract.) From the causes of food allergies, the \u201cgut gymnastics\u201d of digestion and the links between the gut and the subconscious (\u201can unhappy gut can be the cause of an unhappy mind\u201d), to its astonishing population of micro-organisms, the microbiome, which can weigh up to 2kg, Enders shows that far from being ashamed of it we should celebrate our gut. She observes that the movements involved in burping or breaking wind \u201care as delicate and complex as those of a ballerina\u201d. Her enthusiasm is contagious and will change your view of your intestines: \u201cThe more you know about the gut, the more beautiful it appears.\u201d \u2022 To order Gut for \u00a37.99 (RRP \u00a39.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
