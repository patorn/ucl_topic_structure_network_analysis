Joseph Boeckmann Jr resigned from his role as a district court judge in Cross County, a rural area about two hours north-east of Little Rock, on Monday after new allegations surfaced that he used his authority for the past 30 years to prey on young men charged with crimes who needed financial help or who were afraid of losing their children or jobs.  The civil lawsuit against him was filed on Tuesday and asks for damages, claiming Boeckmann abused his position of power to form improper relationships and take sexually charged photographs of men he had sentenced to \u201ccommunity service\u201d. Gary Green, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said that four men were part of the suit and more may join it. \u201cThey were all vulnerable because they were in his court,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing for 37 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d    They were all vulnerable because they were in his court. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this  Gary Green     The lawsuit comes after investigators allegedly found about 4,600 photographs of young men on home computers belonging to Boeckmann. Many of the images depict naked men in \u201cvarious poses inside the judge\u2019s home and outside in his yard\u201d, according to David Sachar, executive director of the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission. Many of the photographs are said to show naked young men from behind after they were spanked by a paddle belonging to the judge, who is accused of giving checks to defendants and people on probation and offering lighter sentences in return for sexual acts. One man lured to Boeckmann\u2019s home under the pretext of carrying out community service was allegedly offered $300 if he agreed to let the judge photograph him posing as Michelangelo\u2019s David. Boeckmann, a former prosecutor, became a Cross County district judge on 1 January 2009 after being elected the previous year. Authorities began investigating after a claim that he oversaw a case in which he had a conflict of interest. The discipline commission announced charges of ethics violations last November. Suspended since November, Boeckmann resigned by letter on Monday and promised never to work again as a public servant in Arkansas. Criminal charges could follow. Sachar told the Guardian that the commission has turned over its findings to state and federal agencies. \u201cThey\u2019re working on it,\u201d he said. Sachar said that 30 to 35 alleged victims had been identified. \u201cWe know there are more,\u201d he said. Boeckmann\u2019s attorney, Jeff Rosenzweig, told the Guardian that his client \u201cdenies all of the allegations. He resigned because it was not worth the stress of such a fight over an office which he was going to vacate in a few months anyway when his term would have expired.\u201d Rosenzweig said he did not want to comment on the lawsuit as he had not seen it. In a lengthy submission last December, seen by the Arkansas Times, Boeckmann, 69, rejected the commission\u2019s claims and said that \u201cany photography was solely for the purpose of recording proof of community service\u201d. Sachar said that though the sexual allegations dated back many years in some cases, they did not come to light until last August when the commission started examining rumors of reduced sentences benefiting young men. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s analogous to what we\u2019ve seen in church organizations, youth organizations or big football programs in America. Sometimes there\u2019s reasons, whether it\u2019s power or whether it\u2019s shame on behalf of the victims. I really don\u2019t know what dynamic kept it so unavailable to public scrutiny,\u201d he said.    I really don\u2019t know what dynamic kept it so unavailable to public scrutiny  David Sachar     A statement of allegations in January says that Boeckmann generally \u201cappears to act as employer, financer and, on occasion, intimate partner of some defendants appearing before him in the court in which he serves\u201d. Witnesses reported seeing criminal defendants, including one younger than 18, get into Boeckmann\u2019s car immediately after leaving his court. The photographs are said to be typically of men aged 18 to 40 who are holding bags of cans and bending over to pick up cans. One, known as RM, appeared before Boeckmann in 2014 because of a traffic ticket and was allegedly one of two young men \u201casked to stay after court to talk to Boeckmann about \u2018community service\u2019\u201d. The complaint states that he was told to collect two bags of cans to give to charity and handed a telephone number that he was to call when he had the cans. When he called he was given an address that turned out to be Boeckmann\u2019s home. RM said he brought the cans and was invited inside, where Boeckmann had a couple of drinks of whisky and repeatedly offered alcohol to his visitor. Boeckmann is reported to have told RM that he did not have to pay a $500 court fine but that the judge needed to \u201cget a picture\u201d of him before he left. Boeckmann allegedly told RM to take a can out of a bag and bend over as if he was picking it up, while spreading his legs farther and farther apart. Then he was offered money to pose as David. Another alleged victim known as AS who appeared in Boeckmann\u2019s court between 2009 and 2012 reportedly had some criminal cases against him dismissed without explanation. The alleged victim claimed that in 2013, when he still had outstanding fines, the judge paid him to pose naked for photographs and to carry out maintenance work at his rental property, as well as writing checks to pay AS\u2019s child support. A witness known as JJ told the commission that Boeckmann\u2019s abusive behavior started long before he became a judge. JJ said that he was personally monitored by Boeckmann after being sentenced to community service and the prosecutor took pictures of him picking up litter by the side of a road. Years later, when he owed Boeckmann money for representing him in a divorce case, JJ said that Boeckmann summoned him to his office, told him to pull his pants down and bend over, and was hit with a paddle and photographed while Boeckmann yelled \u201cyou\u2019d better have a hard-on next time\u201d. JJ said he did not come forward until seeing media coverage of the judge because he feared retribution. An alleged victim dubbed JM who was in the middle of a domestic dispute during Boeckmann\u2019s time as a prosecutor said that he was taken to the courthouse at night, ordered to strip naked and handcuffed. Boeckmann then allegedly told him, \u201cas best you can, spread your butt cheeks with your hands\u201d, took photos, gave him a $50 bill and said \u201cyou\u2019re free to go. Case is dismissed.\u201dThe Associated Press contributed to this report",
