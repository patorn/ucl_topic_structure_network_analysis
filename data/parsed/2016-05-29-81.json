  "body": "If challenged on his unconventional buildings, Oscar Niemeyer, architect of the Mac Niter\u00f3i art gallery which hovers above Rio de Janeiro like a spaceship, would quote Charles Baudelaire: \u201cStrangeness is a necessary ingredient of beauty.\u201d As an aesthetic philosophy, this sums up the Louis Vuitton catwalk collection staged on the snaking ramps of the gallery at sunset on Saturday. Out of the UFO curves of the building came models wearing parachute-silk cape-backed dresses with wetsuit zippers, or silk blouses inspired by Brazilian artist Aldemir Martins\u2019 paintings of Pel\u00e9. The famous Louis Vuitton box trunks were reincarnated as Copacabana beach ghettoblasters, complete with gold hardware and the LV monogram. In the front row, Catherine Deneuve watched imperious, while Brazilian supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio captured the moment for posterity with selfies. There is a strangeness to a fashion extravaganza on this scale being staged in a country which is in the grip of recession, with an impeached president, endemic corruption, a major health crisis looming over the Zika virus, and with the small matter of an Olympic Games to host in two months\u2019 time. Unsurprisingly, designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re took ample artistic licence in the image of Brazil he riffed on for this collection, focusing on a nostalgic Ipaneman glamour and Brazil\u2019s sporting heritage.  The new phenomenon of \u201ccruise\u201d season, of which this show is part, is taking fashion to another dimension. Four megabrands \u2013 Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Christian Dior and Gucci \u2013 have created an elite class of standalone fashion shows, which take place out of the cheek-by-jowl hustle of ready-to-wear fashion weeks. Each brand vies for the most exotic locations and the most prestigious venues. Three weeks ago, Chanel staged its cruise show in Cuba; in the next few days, cruise-fever will arrive in the UK with Dior\u2019s show at Blenheim Palace on Tuesday, closely followed by Gucci\u2019s at Westminster Abbey on Thursday. Where regular fashion weeks are rooted in a trade-show tradition, the cruise shows promote the more abstract modern art of branding. Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s Chanel is cruise\u2019s answer to pop art, all cartoon Cocos and Warholian colours. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s Louis Vuitton, meanwhile, is something more oblique. He is by instinct an avant-garde designer, and he brings an arthouse aesthetic to his blockbuster brand. If a Louis Vuitton cruise show was an art installation, it would be a Carsten H\u00f6ller slide, or a room of Martin Creed\u2019s white balloons. The heritage of Louis Vuitton is in travel, not clothes, and Ghesqui\u00e8re has made the venues for his cruise collections an integral part of their image, taking LV on a world tour of elliptically curved space age architecture. UFO-like buildings have become as much a part of Louis Vuitton\u2019s visual brand as those boxy brown-and-gold trunks were fifty years ago. The venue for last year\u2019s cruise show was Bob Hope\u2019s landmark 1970s-meets-the-future Palm Springs home. By commandeering the world\u2019s chicest spaceships as catwalks, Ghesqui\u00e8re keeps the fantasy element of the Vuitton lifestyle alive in an era where air travel has lost its glamour.  This was a sexier, more body-conscious Louis Vuitton. With their low-cut necklines and side cut-outs, the opening dresses had the look of very dressed-up swimwear. Where skirts were long they were cut to ribbons, for plenty of leg. The timelessly ethereal desert-sand shades of last year\u2019s Palm Springs collection were replaced by bold, attention-grabbing colours. Backstage after the show, Ghesqui\u00e8re said it was the integration of sportswear into urban style that he loved in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cI have always loved the clothes that women wear on city streets, and I am obsessed with sport and with movement. Here in Rio, beach life is urban life.\u201d The influence of Brazil\u2019s sporting heritage \u2013 and of a city about to host the Olympics \u2013 could be felt in the Pel\u00e9-print jerseys, in lightweight football shorts, and in scuba-fabric high-top shoes.  New LV muse Jaden Smith, teenage son of Hollywood actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, lavished praise on those scuba high-tops backstage after the show, saying he was hoping to wear them himself. The 17-year-old, whose appearance in a skirt in a Vuitton womenswear campaign caused a stir earlier this year, drew by far the loudest screams of the evening when he turned from talking to Ghesqui\u00e8re to wave to the Brazilian teenagers gathered outside the gallery. \u201cI loved that show,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it just looks like the future.\u201d",
