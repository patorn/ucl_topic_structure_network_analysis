  "body": "Any film dramatising the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust risks accusations of trivialising, misrepresenting or exploiting its awful subject matter. When L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes\u2019s debut feature, a harrowing drama set in Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944, premiered last year at Cannes, the New York Times critic Manohla Dargis dismissed it as a \u201cradically dehistoricised, intellectually repellent\u201d work in which \u201ctechnical virtuosity\u201d risked diverting the audience\u2019s attention from \u201cthe misery on screen\u201d. Focusing its tightly held, shallow-focus gaze on a single prisoner in whose face we see reflections of atrocities too hellish to depict, Son of Saul is indeed a stylistic masterpiece, a film of precise visual and aural design, executed with fearsome skill, precision and commitment. Yet far from being a \u201ctechnical\u201d triumph, the claustrophobic aesthetic that Nemes employs has a powerful moral raison d\u2019etre, seemingly born out of a desire to address a subject that arguably has no place in dramatic cinema. Feature first-timer G\u00e9za R\u00f6hrig is astonishing as Saul Ausl\u00e4nder, a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner forced to work on the Nazis\u2019 extermination production line as a member of the Sonderkommando, the special squad whose controversial legacy has inspired such narrative features as Tim Blake Nelson\u2019s The Grey Zone (2001). We first meet Saul emerging from incongruously leafy woodlands (Nemes has cited Elem Klimov\u2019s 1985 Come and See as a touchstone), shepherding new arrivals into the gas chambers where they will be poisoned, their bodies burned, their ashes shovelled into a river. Saul\u2019s expression is one of mortified catatonia \u2013 a silent scream within this ninth circle of hell. But when a young boy survives Zyklon B inhalation only to be summarily suffocated by a doctor, Saul claims the body to be that of his son, whom he resolves to bury with dignity. His mission is desperate and threatens to endanger a planned uprising among his fellow prisoners. \u201cWe will die because of you,\u201d one tells him, to which Saul replies: \u201cWe are already dead.\u201d     Exclusive trailer for Son of Saul   Even writing that brief synopsis feels almost obscenely prurient. Yet M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Erd\u00e9ly\u2019s camera consistently pushes the horrors that surround Saul to and beyond the edges of the film\u2019s 4x3 frame, the narrowness of the image somehow broadening the scope of its impact. In several sequences set within the gas chambers and furnaces of Saul\u2019s netherworld existence, only R\u00f6hrig\u2019s face is in focus, the Boschian landscape of suffering and death in which he dwells remaining expressionistic rather than explicit. Yet even as our eyes are turned away from the abyss, an incessant soundtrack of screams, barks, orders, gunshots, cries and whispers evokes a cataclysmic landscape of evil unbound. The effect is utterly overpowering. Writing about the impossibility of representing the Holocaust in dramas such as Spielberg\u2019s Schindler\u2019s List, the great French film-maker Claude Lanzmann (whose monumental Shoah eschewed archive footage for eye-witness testimony) famously declared that \u201cfiction is a transgression\u201d and spoke of his own belief in \u201ca ban on depiction\u201d. Yet, after seeing Son of Saul, Lanzmann concluded that it gave \u201ca very real sense of what it was like to be in the Sonderkommando\u201d, in a manner that was \u201cnot at all melodramatic\u201d and \u201cdone with a very great modesty\u201d. Lanzmann\u2019s most recent feature, The Last of the Unjust, revisited a 1975 interview with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last surviving president of the Jewish Council in Theresienstadt whom some had branded a collaborator, but whom Lanzmann found to be \u201cextraordinarily courageous\u201d. Although different in form, Nemes\u2019s fictional film (inspired by the real-life accounts recorded in the \u201cscrolls of Auschwitz\u201d) shares with Lanzmann\u2019s work a preoccupation with what Primo Levi called the Nazis\u2019 \u201cdemonic crime\u201d of attempting \u201cto shift on to others \u2013 specifically, the victims \u2013 the burden of guilt\u201d.     Director Laszlo Nemes, left, on the set of Son of Saul with actor Geza Rohrig.    Within the godless void of his enslaved existence, Saul\u2019s desperate search for a rabbi to recite the Mourner\u2019s Kaddish over the body of the child \u2013 who may or may not be his own (we are never sure and it never matters) \u2013 seems to represent an act of atonement, a cleansing ritual amid the stench of the Sonderkommando\u2019s mephitic existence. Accepting the Oscar for foreign language film, Nemes stated that \u201cthe hope of this film\u201d was to show that \u201ceven in the darkest hours, there might be a voice within us that allows us to remain human\u201d. Those dark hours (the film takes place over two days and one night) are as vividly, devastatingly portrayed as anything I have experienced in the cinema; I struggle to remember the last time a non-documentary film proved so profoundly, soul-shakingly distressing. This is as it should be \u2013 anything less would be immoral and irresponsible. Yet, unthinkable as it seems, there is a glimmer of light in this appalling darkness, infinitesimal yet inextinguishable. Ultimately, it is that glimmer that makes Son of Saul so traumatic. Days after watching it I remain haunted by Saul\u2019s face, his skin covered in the ashes of the dead, his eyes alert with anxiety and anguish, a recognisable trace of humanity in world beyond belief.",
