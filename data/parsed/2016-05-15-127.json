  "body": "Film festivals and awards juries should positively discriminate towards female films, a panel in Cannes said on Saturday.  Discussing the disappointing awards haul for Suffragette \u2013 the female-directed, scripted, produced and starring drama about the movement to secure women the vote in England \u2013 the panel said \u201cunconscious bias\u201d may have played a part.    Related: Female film directors must get equal funding \u2013\u00a0but they mustn't all be white    \u201cI think that\u2019s really depressing,\u201d said Ben Roberts, chair of the BFI Film Fund, about the film\u2019s complete lack of Bafta nominations. Festivals and awards present, he said, \u201copportunities to put a message out\u201d which are currently being neglected.\u00a0 \u201cAnyone who votes for Baftas shouldn\u2019t just think about what\u2019s best but what puts out some positive signals and celebrates our achievements in a different way. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of Bafta members to use that platform to demonstrate that we\u2019re proud of our industry we\u2019re progressive and we\u2019re going to lead from the front.\u00a0 \u201cThink about what you\u2019re saying on the night and what that is saying to the commercial sector the critical sector, to audiences to future film-makers.\u201d Roberts also sought to debunk the received wisdom that films directed by women are less easy to sell overseas. When he worked in sales, he said, some Japanese distributors had once told him: \u201cI love your film but it\u2019s good too many black people.\u201d He had discussed the issue with them and they relented. When faced by a similar prejudice in terms of female-directed films, said Roberts, \u201cI would say: \u2018That\u2019s just crap.\u2019\u201d Other members of the panel echoed the sentiment, describing the lack of commercial viability of female productions as a \u201cred herring\u201d. Amanda Nevill, BFI CEO, said research they had conducted found that \u201cpound-for-pound female-directed films are a better bet\u201d. Nevill said that although increased parity in public funding was important, both in the opportunities offered and message sent, other practical measures \u2013\u00a0such as childcare \u2013 were needed to encourage women to remain in the film industry.\u00a0   Related: BFI CEO: Without diversity, cinema will become irrelevant    Foster also added that \u201csystematic changes in behaviour need to extend to the private sector\u201d if progress is to be achieved. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting public funds you must address imbalances. Mandatory targets are really important as they help us to tell the world we are an open and equal and good creative environment.\u201d The Directors UK report, which led the BFI Film Fund to commit to 50/50 funding by 2020, was informed by the situation in other parts of the world. Although the gender split studying at film school in the UK is roughly equal, only around 3% of those employed on sets are women, while men are six times more likely to shoot a film.\u00a0 In the UK, 75% of those asked said they felt it was a problematically sexist industry; in France, that figure was just 35%.",
