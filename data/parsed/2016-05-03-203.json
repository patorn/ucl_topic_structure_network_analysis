  "body": "Conventional political wisdom will be turned on its head in Thursday\u2019s local elections. Normally the official opposition should be confident of making substantial gains, particularly when a governing party is bitterly divided. Labour will not do well. That is only part of a complex undercurrent behind this year\u2019s contests in 54 metropolitan and unitary councils, 70 smaller districts, plus four mayoral elections in England. The untold story, particularly in the shires, is the simmering resentment, verging on open revolt, between senior Conservative councillors and the government. They are aghast at arbitrary change being thrust upon their areas \u2013 from pushing new trans-council structures and elected mayors to regressive housing and planning reform \u2013 without any discussion. Ministers are edgy, listening.   Related: Tory local government leader asks Lords to block housing reforms    Then there\u2019s a tension \u2013 a yawning divide, say some \u2013 between pragmatic Labour councils and a radical, anti-austerity leadership that has failed to connect with the public. Some councils and groups of authorities in conurbations are doing deals with the government. Shadow ministers are hostile. Rarely are local elections being held at such a deeply turbulent time for local government. Whitehall support is uncertain as the government moves to abolish its funding of English local councils by 2020 and \u00a326bn of revenue is devolved from business rates. There\u2019s little indication of how authorities in poorer areas with low tax bases will be compensated with the scrapping of a formula designed to deliver at least a degree of equity across the country. So far, ministers have been unwilling to say exactly how the weak will be supported \u2013 leaving some senior town hall figures to warn starkly that the poorest town halls risk going to the wall, Detroit-style. If that isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s growing unease about the future structure of councils. Does the local government map as we know it risk being redrawn \u2013 call it by design, accident or a mixture of both \u2013 with an unelected politician pulling strings behind the scenes? Enter Lord (Michael) Heseltine, the former deputy prime minister, seemingly influential, stalking the corridors of power, and close to the chancellor, George Osborne. Heseltine has long advocated a unitary, or single-tier structure of local government throughout England (broadly similar to Scotland and Wales) and the abolition of 201 second-tier district councils \u2013 coupled with the imposition of elected mayors, particularly in conurbations such as Greater Manchester. Local Conservatives often don\u2019t like what they hear \u2013 particularly an elected mayor overseeing a disparate cluster of local councils. Now it seems other models \u2013 dismantling some counties with a mix of district amalgamations \u2013 are being covertly encouraged to create a new breed of unitary councils. Ministers accept that the Greater Manchester \u201cmetro mayor\u201d model \u2013 being replicated in some conurbations, but rejected in others \u2013 is hardly right for all the country.   Related: After the floods, local government is fighting to stay afloat | Peter Hetherington    As Ed Cox, director of the IPPR North thinktank has noted, many suspect that the insistence of these so-called \u201cmetro mayors\u201d has betrayed the fact that another key objective for the government in England is local government reform. He thinks many feel that the faltering nature of deal making, following Greater Manchester and a string of other places, has privileged some places over others \u2013 and with many big city deals largely sorted out, the Treasury, a key player, \u201cseems to have lost interest in striking deals with more peripheral places\u201d. The result, unsurprisingly, is growing uncertainty in English local government, compounded by a national government with no clear plan or sense of direction \u2013 apart from a view that the present structure is not fit for purpose. Next year, with polling due in 27 county councils \u2013 the traditional preserve of Conservatism \u2013 one question will override all others: will they be the last such elections? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.",
