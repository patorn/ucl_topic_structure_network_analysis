  "body": "Facebook will sponsor the Republican and Democratic national conventions this summer providing \u201cfinancial and other support\u201d \u2013 despite pressure from progressive organizations and CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s own veiled criticisms of presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric.  \u201cThis support allows Facebook to facilitate an open dialogue among voters, candidates and elected officials during the conventions, just as it has during other critical moments in the US elections and in elections around the world,\u201d Erin Egan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of public policy, said in a statement. Facebook maintains that its sponsorship of the GOP convention, which will reportedly include a \u201clounge\u201d, does not constitute an endorsement, but the announcement has angered a coalition of organizations that have launched campaigns urging technology companies and other corporations not to sponsor the party of Trump.    Related: Blame it on the Zodiac killer: did social media ruin Ted Cruz's campaign?    \u201cLifting up Donald Trump\u2019s fascist platform at the Republican National Convention is irresponsible and dangerous,\u201d said Murshed Zaheed, political director of the progressive activist network CREDO. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t possible for Facebook to financially support a Trump-led Republican convention without associating its brand with Donald Trump\u2019s hateful rhetoric.\u201d At Facebook\u2019s developer conference in April, Zuckerberg made guarded remarks about Trump describing \u201cfearful voices talking about building walls\u201d. \u201cI hear them calling for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, for reducing trade, and in some cases, even for cutting access to the internet,\u201d he added. Facebook employees have also had internal conversations about whether the powerful media platform has a \u201cresponsibility \u2026 to help prevent President Trump in 2017\u201d, according to Gizmodo.  Zuckerberg\u2019s comments may have raised expectations that Facebook would balk at sponsoring an event that will mark Trump\u2019s official nomination as the Republican presidential candidate, but the CEO and his company have stymied liberal hopes in the past.  In 2013, Zuckerberg\u2019s political lobbying group Fwd.us paid for political advertisements supporting the Keystone XL pipeline, in a convoluted (and unsuccessful) play to win Republican votes for immigration reform.  Recently, Facebook has been under pressure from groups such as Color of Change to improve the diversity of its staff and to crack down on harassment and hate speech on its platform.  \u201cWhen you put together those two things and add on the fact that they\u2019re choosing to sponsor a convention that is a coronation ball for a white nationalist who has said vile things about Latino people, Black people, Muslim people and women, it\u2019s troubling that Facebook would make a decision to host a lounge,\u201d said Arisha Hatch, managing director of campaigns for Color of Change. Hatch said Facebook had convened a conference call with her and other organizations on Thursday to discuss the decision to host the convention, but did not back away from its position.  \u201cFacebook, like Google, has a responsibility to support free speech, not the kind of chilling hate speech propagated by a Trump-led GOP convention,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, who has worked with Facebook to address the problem of harassment of racial justice organizers on the platform.  \u201cFacebook has expressed what I hoped was a genuine desire to ensure all its users were safe on its platform,\u201d she said, but its support of the convention \u201cdiscounts that work, and makes everyone, including Facebook users of color, less safe, less secure, and less supported online\u201d. Facebook is not the only tech company facing criticism for its sponsorship of the GOP convention.  On Thursday, CREDO released a video featuring clips of Trump\u2019s calling Mexicans rapists and calling for a total ban on Muslims entering the US and criticizing Google for its decision to sponsor the RNC.  The video will be advertised to more than 10,000 employees of Google, using micro-targeting \u2013 on Facebook.",
