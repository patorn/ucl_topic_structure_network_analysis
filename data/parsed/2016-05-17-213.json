The huge \u201cred tide\u201d has grown rapidly over recent weeks, in what has been described as the country\u2019s worst environmental crisis in recent years: dozens of people have been poisoned by the algal bloom which makes seafood toxic and has deprived thousands of fishermen of a living.   Related: Unprecedented 'red tide' crisis deepens in Chile's fishing-rich waters    Scientists attribute the unusually potent and widespread algal bloom to unseasonably warm water temperatures as a result of the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. But the spotlight is now being focused on the salmon industry amid allegations that the algal bloom may have been exacerbated by the dumping of rotting salmon in the open ocean and the massive piles of salmon faeces and salmon food now smothering portions of the seafloor. Chile\u2019s investigative police force confirmed that an investigation had been launched. \u201cI want to categorically affirm that we are investigating the possible criminal acts in regards to the dumping of dead salmon into the sea,\u201d announced regional prosecutor Marcos Emilfork.      People shout slogans as they listen to a speech during a protest on Chilo\u00e9 island, Chile. The sign in the background reads in Spanish: \u2018Salmon farms out! Free Chiloe.\u2019 Local residents blame large-scale salmon farms for the algal bloom. Photograph: Esteban Felix/AP    \u201cEnvironmental crimes are extremely serious and are a priority,\u201d said Emilfork, who emphasised that prison sentences would be appropriate for anyone found guilty. Chile\u2019s president, Michelle Bachelet, has named a scientific commission to investigate the environmental catastrophe \u2013 and examine suggestions that human activity may have worsened the red tide. Marine biologist Hector Kol said the algal bloom may have been triggered by nutrients which are dumped into floating salmon cages, and then fall to the sea bed. These underwater banks of nutrients, said Kol, may act as a reservoir for the toxic algae, providing refuge and shelter. \u201cThe problem we now have is a red tide of biblical proportions,\u201d said Kol. \u201cChilo\u00e9 has changed, the sea is toxic. Right now we have a red tide with symptoms of diarrhoea, amnesia and paralysis from near the Straits of Magellan to Valdivia\u201d \u2013 a stretch of more than 1,200 miles (2,000km) of coastline. Felipe Sandoval, president of the trade group SalmonChile, denied that salmon farming was to blame. \u201cThis is not a conflict about the salmon industry, which is one of the most regulated industries in Chile and the world,\u201d he told local radio. \u201cWe have high environmental standards \u2026 not just because of the local regulations but also because of the market [conditions] where the product is going.\u201d The unprecedented \u201cred tide\u201d comes after an earlier infection this year wiped out some 20% of Chile\u2019s multibillion-dollar farmed salmon industry. Beginning in late December, higher-than-normal ocean water temperatures resulted in death of at least 27m salmon. An estimated 50m pounds of dead salmon were then hauled from the water and ground up to make fishmeal for the healthy fish. Another 20m pounds was buried in dumps around the region. While detectives and scientists collect samples and evidence, animal carcasses litter the coastline of Chilo\u00e9 island after a string of mass die-offs: in June, 337 sei whales were found dead in one of the biggest strandings in history; earlier this month, 40,000 tons of dead sardines washed ashore at the mouth of the Queule river. Elsewhere, dead squid have washed ashore, while dogs have also perished after eating the poisoned shellfish.     Thousands of bivalves of the species Mesodesma donacium washed up dead in the Cucao beach in the island of Chilo\u00e9. Photograph: Damian Parra/EPA    Dante Montiel, the municipal secretary for Castro, one of Chilo\u00e9\u2019s most important cities, described the salmon industry as \u201ca missile that crossed Chilo\u00e9, disintegrated the community, the society, and handed out salaries that were very modest\u201d. \u201cWe now have the consequences: environmental and social disintegration,\u201d he said. Protests by local fishermen demanding economic aid from the government have brought commerce on the island to a halt. Another 150m salmon are now at risk of dying due to difficulties in feeding the fish and controlling diseases like the ISA virus and endemic sea-lice infections that spread from one densely populated offshore cage to another. Felipe Manterola, general manager of SalmonChile, warned that if the blockades continue, the remaining healthy salmon could resort to \u201ccompetition and cannibalism\u201d. In an interview with El Llanquihue, a local newspaper, Manterola said Chilean salmon farming was in such crisis that \u201cour days are numbered\u201d and suggested that the massive deaths were \u201ca shot in the head to the industry\u201d.",
