  "body": "It is probably too soon to expect Charlotte Edwards to appreciate the irony of her situation. The England cricket captain, who has given the past 20 years of her life to improving her national team, was told this week that she would play no further part in it. After a career spent campaigning for women cricketers to be treated like any other professional sportsmen she has rudely discovered what that means. Edwards\u2019s pursuit of excellence has been so successful that she is the first major victim of its new, all-business, only-victory-will-do incarnation. It is right and encouraging that we make increasingly high demands of our increasingly well-paid (or, let\u2019s be honest, just paid) representatives on the fields of cricket, rugby and football. Like the Flash\u2019s Speed Force offering glimpses of the future, the pace of progress in the women\u2019s game throws up these hints of what\u2019s to come. But it also offers us a fresh lens on to professional sport as a whole. Elements of men\u2019s sport that we have long since taken for granted, and allowed to become blurry as a result, return to focus as women encounter them for the first time. Unscrupulous football agents make unrealistic promises to young players. Fans (and, admittedly, sportswriters) forget that players are human and scrutinise them without mercy. England\u2019s women cricketers learned, for instance, that it is unwise to post pictures of themselves having a good time on tour if they\u2019ve just lost a match. It turns out Twitter doesn\u2019t like it. Then there\u2019s the idea that public funding \u2013 either in the form of ticket sales or government subsidy \u2013 demands ever better results and the results themselves justify the means by which they were achieved. Hence the sexism row surrounding Shane Sutton and the belief that if women want to compete on the same level as men, they need to, well, man up.   Related: England women\u2019s cricket will be a harsher world without Charlotte Edwards | Mike Selvey    If the British Cycling affair has taught us anything it\u2019s that women often have something different to say about what is and isn\u2019t acceptable behaviour in the bubbling cauldron of machismo that so often defines the sporting arena. They have brought a fresh perspective \u2013 not to say an emotional intelligence \u2013 to an industry that has long been noseblind to excess testosterone, that has tacitly endorsed bullying and come to treat vicious verbals as an unavoidable byproduct. Sutton\u2019s story is nothing new; if anything, he is a blast from the past. Women\u2019s sport has an uncomfortable history of domineering men, be it Soviet coaches grooming young gymnasts or tennis fathers living out their dreams through their progeny. Thankfully, we have safeguards to prevent exploitation. But macho culture is an inevitable part of an industry based on the adrenaline high created by warring opposites. In the fight for equality, it\u2019s natural for sportswomen to demand what their male counterparts have: the same opportunities, the same rewards. These have been a long time coming, but change is now rushing in with an almost unexpected swiftness and in the rush to replicate the professionalism of the men\u2019s game there\u2019s an inclination to ape it in every regard. To assume that men know better than women what it takes to compete, to win, to be sufficiently aggressive on the battlefield. Isn\u2019t it worth, at this crucial, formative moment, pausing to consider what we want, not just for women\u2019s sport but all sport? The exponential growth of women\u2019s sport is an unmissable opportunity to champion something new and to address elements that macho culture has damaged. To fashion an inclusive environment, maybe one that doesn\u2019t cheat and dive and swear at the referee or scream abuse at the very players whose names we have tattooed on our chest. One way to do that, I would suggest, is making sure that sportswomen aren\u2019t unthinkingly submitting to existing wisdom and methodologies on the basis that only men can teach them how to be professionals.

It\u2019s something Gianni Infantino acknowledged on Friday as the Fifa president appointed Fatma Samoura as the organisation\u2019s first female and first non-European secretary general. At a Sporting Equals event at the House of Commons, meanwhile, the head of UK Sport, Rod Carr, revealed that the government will soon announce the controversial inclusion of diversity targets (of both gender and race), including the raising of female representation at boardroom level from 25% to 30%. What was particularly striking\u200b at that event was the testimony of Annie Zaidi, reflecting on her mould-breaking career coaching men\u2019s football. She was once sent to St James\u2019 Park to train a group of \u201cboisterous\u201d Geordies, who were unimpressed to discover that their new coach was a young Asian woman. \u201cThey bruised me, they battered me,\u201d she said. But as the players came to understand that she knew what she was talking about, their attitude turned to respect \u2013 and so did their manners. Annie was, nevertheless, under no illusions about the rare position she is in. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anyone to look up to except Hope Powell, so I know I have a responsibility to inspire the next generation.\u201d Only 18% of the qualified coaching workforce in the UK is female. As Carr put it, \u201cwe\u2019re only at the start of the journey\u201d. The former England cricket captain Clare Connor has become a valued administrator at the England and Wales Cricket Board. Is it too much to hope that Edwards might become an equally respected national coach? If we want to change global sporting culture for the better, then having more women in positions of influence doesn\u2019t seem a bad place to start.",
