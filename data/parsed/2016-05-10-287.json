The budget airline said it took the decision to increase the proportion of earnings from 40% after a thorough review of its financial position. It said it was not a response to pressure from Haji-Ioannou.  Haji-Ioannou, who is easyJet\u2019s biggest shareholder, stepped up his criticism of the company in February, accusing it of a scattergun dividend policy that he said depressed its share price. Through his easyGroup holding company, he called for easyJet to pay out half of earnings to shareholders. Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cSir Stelios has been saying this for six years. It\u2019s not something he has raised recently. We always talk to easyGroup and all our shareholders. It wouldn\u2019t have had an impact on the decision today because it\u2019s something we\u2019ve known about for many years.\u201d     EasyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou and CEO Carolyn McCall.

Haji-Ioannou said the commitment to pay out half of profit made things clearer for shareholders but that easyJet\u2019s plan to increase the size of its fleet of 247 planes by 7% to 8% a year was wasteful and that some of the planes would not be profitable. He said: \u201cI think all shareholders like some profitable growth, not unprofitable growth. The company needs to find the right balance on growth rate in the fleet before the profits start going down again like they did in the previous decade. Remember the payout ratio is only a ratio after all.\u201d The budget carrier said it expected to meet market forecasts for the year despite swinging to a \u00a324m pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of March from a \u00a37m profit a year earlier.

The company said revenue per seat fell 6.6% after it cut prices following the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels to encourage wary travellers back on to planes.  Cancelled flights to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, after a Russian passenger plane was downed by a bomb, and currency movements also affected revenue per seat. This will fall about 7% in the current quarter, which ends in June, though bookings are back in line with a year earlier, the company said. In the period, passenger numbers rose 7.4% on the year to 31 million. McCall said passenger numbers were back to normal but that easyJet would have to keep prices low for a while longer rather than imposing sudden increases. \u201cDemand always comes back. We\u2019ve seen that with both the tragic events that have happened [last] year and we\u2019ve seen that in the past. If you are a consumer it\u2019s a very, very good time to fly because prices are 6% less than a year ago. EasyJet\u2019s first-half result was slightly better than analysts\u2019 average forecast for a loss of \u00a325.7m, according to Bloomberg. Analysts expect profit for the year that ends in September to be \u00a3721m, up from \u00a3686m last year. The company\u2019s shares, down about 17% this year, rose almost 3% to \u00a315 in afternoon trading.",
