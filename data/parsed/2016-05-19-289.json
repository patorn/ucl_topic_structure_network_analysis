Tempest delivered her impassioned critique in an opening address for the Sydney writers\u2019 festival. Speaking in front of international headliners, writers\u2019 festival guests and ticket holders, Tempest\u2019s talk took a surprisingly pointed turn towards Australian politics, inequality and racism:   I\u2019ve been out to Australia a few times now. I\u2019ve got family here, and I was here touring in January with my band, and I have to say this. I\u2019m very happy to be here, I\u2019m very honoured to be on this stage, but I have to say this: there is a damaging and poisonous racism at root in this country. And I know that I\u2019m not meant to say it. And the fact that I\u2019m not meant to say it in polite society is even more damaging.    Related: The Bricks That Built the Houses by Kate Tempest review \u2013 daring and vivid    Between performances of her poetry at the Roslyn Packer Theatre in Walsh Bay on Tuesday evening, Tempest delivered an unscripted speech about empathy, history, politics and the importance of storytelling.  \u201cI believe that if we want to make a change, we have to change the dominant cultural narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we realise the fault in a story we\u2019re telling, and we don\u2019t want that story any more, how do we change that narrative? I feel like we have to become aware of it \u2026 and only then can we stop it.\u201d           Poet Kate Tempest\u2019s powerful performance on ABC TV\u2019s Q&A on Monday night    Tempest added, over a breakout of audience applause: \u201cAs long as we can play nice and get on with our things while the people who are being most oppressed can not make the decision to pretend it isn\u2019t going on, the wound on the soul of the earth gets deeper and deeper.  \u201cThis is my history too,\u201d Tempest continued, her voice shaky. \u201cI\u2019m living it, it\u2019s happening. We are at the end of colonial history, British history. I want to say something to you, I want to be able to talk about it. Guilt is not good enough any more. Guilt is narcissism. Your guilt is about you. My guilt is about me. It\u2019s not good enough.  \u201cEmpathy. Empathy, humility, reparation and change,\u201d she urged.  Don\u2019t clap it. Don\u2019t clap it. Because then it\u2019s that: it\u2019s a good speech at a thing, it gets clapped. It\u2019s not that. This is from the bottom of my fucking pits. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever wanted to say and I have to say it right now, and I\u2019m terrified, because I know you\u2019re not meant to say it. I\u2019m fucking terrified. That is what I wanted to say; I wanted to bring it into the space and encourage you to just fucking have the conversation with each other. The conversations are being had, I\u2019m sure \u2013 I don\u2019t mean to patronise you, I\u2019m not here to blame you, I feel really fucking awkward and weird, but this must be said.  Tempest spoke about the importance of literature, and of listening to and engaging with the world around us. \u201cEngage with the reality, not just lip service \u2013 the reality of what this land is saying. Of what happened here. Of what continues to happen here. Talk to your children about it, talk to your friends.\u201d   Related: Writers' festival cheat sheet: how to bluff your way through the literary season    This is the second time Tempest has appeared at the Sydney writers\u2019 festival, after a smaller tour in 2013. In the years since she has won the Ted Hughes award for innovation in poetry; been nominated for the Mercury prize for her hip-hop album Everybody Down; and been selected as one of Poetry Book Society\u2019s 20 next generation poets \u2013 a prestigious list picked just once per decade. Tempest is currently on a global tour to promote her first novel, The Bricks That Built the Houses, and was invited back to the Sydney writers\u2019 festival as a headliner. The speech continued the conversation Tempest began with national audiences on Monday night\u2019s Q&A program on ABC TV. \u201cThere is an awful, awful interplay here between what we think of as an acceptable evil and a nonacceptable evil,\u201d she said during the show. \u201cWe can spot barbarity in our cultures, we can spot it in our past, but when it is in our midst we find it much harder to accept and own up to it. We are in the middle of a barbarous time and it\u2019s greed that\u2019s at the root of it.\u201d Tempest left the Sydney writers\u2019 festival audience with a plea: \u201cFor the rest of this week I hope that you have a beautiful and important time, but just stop it \u2013 stop pretending. It\u2019s real. This is real life \u2026 I know it sounds like I\u2019m getting a bit hysterical \u2013 and if you are recording it don\u2019t fucking broadcast it \u2013 I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s like: we can\u2019t keep pretending that everything is going to be OK.\u201d \u2022 Kate Tempest appears at Sydney writers\u2019 festival on 20 and 21 May; at the Avid Reader bookshop in Brisbane on 23 May; at the Byron Theatre on 24 May; and at the Wheeler Centre, Melbourne on 26 May. Tempest\u2019s novel, The Bricks That Built The Houses, is out now through Bloomsbury",
