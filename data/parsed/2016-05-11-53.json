  "body": "When asked if he agreed with David Cameron\u2019s assertion that Nigeria was \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d, the west African country\u2019s tall, austere president thought for a moment and then said softly: \u201cYes.\u201d Muhammadu Buhari came to office on a promise to fight Nigeria\u2019s legendary corruption, and he is admired and feared for his tenacity.  He has been in trouble for bad-mouthing his countrymen before, but Buhari, for all his faults, has a reputation for being scrupulously honest.  And, speaking in London on Wednesday after the British prime minister\u2019s embarrassing diplomatic gaffe, he was not about to gloss over the defining issue of his presidency.    Related: Nigeria not seeking a Cameron apology, but 'wants its assets back'    \u201cFrom a personal integrity point of view, nobody will question his personal commitment to dealing with corruption,\u201d said Manji Cheto, a west African risk analyst. \u201cBut there are questions about the way he\u2019s dealing with it. It almost feels like the end justifies the means.\u201d Buhari\u2019s government has made high-profile arrests and launched many investigations into former officials and politicians in the administration of his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan. However, critics say that those mandated to pursue the alleged thieves are under-funded and, rather than focus on painstakingly securing a few major scalps, use a scattergun approach of intimidation and trial by the public to implicate many. \u201cI fear none of these cases will stand up in a court of law,\u201d Cheto said. \u201cThe current tactics are undermining Nigerian institutions.\u201d Worryingly, Buhari\u2019s government appears to be relying on clawing back its stolen billions, squirrelled away in international banks or spent on expensive property in London, in order to plug the gap in its finances caused by falling oil prices.   Related: Nigeria calls on anti-corruption summit to back registers of ownership    \u201cClearly Buhari is hoping for more international support to counter oil theft \u2013 he wants legislation,\u201d Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, said. Nigeria loses billions of dollars worth of oil each month. It is unclear how realistic an aim this is \u2013 and how far western governments are willing to go to turn \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d Nigeria around. \u201cNigerians are saying thank you very much, Mr Cameron, for pointing it out, but you tell us what your government has done to stem the outflow of embezzled money into London?\u201d Cheto said. Buhari\u2019s adherents say that it was his first anti-corruption drive that led to his initial political demise in the 1980s. He was ousted in a military coup, because, according to his supporters, the coup\u2019s leaders were worried about becoming the targets of his investigations.  In his second presidency, there seems to be more of an appetite for his rigour. The question is whether, this time around, he can capitalise on this appetite, and set up institutions and international agreements to tackle corruption that will outlast his political career.",
