If it\u2019s true, why is the crime rate not significantly higher, as straight guys compete with each other to look \u201cbadder\u201d than their friends? In fact what do we mean by \u201cbad\u201d anyway? Are we talking bank robbers, or just your mate Clive who once dumped a girl via text?  Broadly published an article this week entitled Why Women Want To F**k Bad Boys, in which writer Diana Tourjee claimed that: \u201cEveryone knows men like these \u2026 (so-called \u2018bad boys,\u2019 or risk-taking men) \u2026 are desirable. Thanks to a recent study, this is now scientifically verifiable.\u201d Wow. If science really has confirmed that every woman on the planet will make an identical sexual choice, then surely someone\u2019s in line for a Marie-Claire-sponsored Nobel Prize. But is it true? Well ... like that guy in the club who \u201cguarantees\u201d you the best night of your life, you should familiarise yourself with the detail before making any decisions. The research Tourjee is referring to is The Young Male Cigarette and Alcohol Syndrome - Smoking and Drinking as a Short-Term Mating Strategy. It was published earlier this year in the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology. Already a few alarm bells are ringing, because evolutionary psychology is notoriously controversial. It\u2019s common for mainstream press articles to sex up their science reporting, but implying that \u201cscience has verified\u201d something based on an evolutionary psychology paper is as accurate as claiming that scientists have verified the deliciousness of Marmite. The second issue with the article is its conflation of \u201cbad\u201d with drinking and smoking. Sure, a twenty-a-day habit is unhealthy, not to mention it makes you smell like the bins outside Wetherspoons, but is it really the criteria by which we judge \u201cbad boys\u201d? In my experience, and relating to those phrases we hear so often (\u201cNice guys finish last!\u201d), \u201cbadness\u201d encompasses more than just unhealthy behaviour. A bad boy might ride a motorcycle (risky), but he may be \u201cbad\u201d in other ways too. When \u201cnice guys\u201d complain that they\u2019re always finishing last, usually what they mean is that other men (the ones their female friends are sleeping with) are simply not good enough. This could mean anything from not buying his girlfriend flowers on Valentine\u2019s Day to cheating on her, cadging money or saying rude things about her Mum.     You can tell a bad boy because they always smoke. Nothing attracts a woman more than stale tobacco smell and yellowed fingers. Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock    As ever, the way this has been reported probably isn\u2019t the fault of the researcher who published it, Eveline Vincke, who was pretty clear about her aims: \u201cWe aim to explore the hypothesis that male smoking and drinking behavior\u2014being risky physical consumption behaviors\u2014are used as a male short-term mating strategy.\u201d Let\u2019s look at the key questions as they relate to the \u201cbad boy\u201d theory. Firstly, do risky behaviours like smoking and drinking in young males correlate with more short-term sexual activity (one night stands and the like)? Secondly, does adopting a \u201crisk-taking\u201d strategy \u2013 i.e. smoking and drinking more \u2013 work to secure the approval of female peers? In layman\u2019s terms: do you actually get more action if you\u2019re a smokin\u2019, drinkin\u2019 bad boy? Vincke\u2019s answer to both of these questions is \u201cyes\u201d. But any layperson can spot that they don\u2019t support the grand assumptions made by Tourjee that \u201cwomen prefer bad boys\u201d, because there are complicating factors. Given that casual sex is often considered (or at least presented as) \u201crisky behaviour\u201d, it\u2019s unsurprising that men who are risky in other ways might also be risky in this one. What\u2019s more, my mother tells me alcohol has a slight impact on one\u2019s impulsive decision-making, so the addition of \u201cdrinking\u201d to the risk factors could simply imply that drunk people have more casual sex. We\u2019ve gone from Why Women Want To F**k A Bad Boy to Young Males Who Smoke And Drink More Likely To Also Have Casual Sex. When it comes to the conclusions on mating strategy, again the research says that, yes, men may be using this as a deliberate tactic to tempt women into bed. But Vincke touched on another key factor, which is absent from the Broadly article: women\u2019s agency. If young male \u201cbad boys\u201d have more casual sex, then a woman seeking casual sex should reasonably adopt a \u201cshag a bad boy\u201d mating strategy. Not out of desire necessarily, just sheer pragmatism. And even if there\u2019s no deliberate strategy from either gender, we\u2019d expect the results to look like that anyway. A better headline now would perhaps be Women Are More Likely To Have Casual Sex With Men Who Also Have Casual Sex. Which is trivially true - a woman is more likely to buy you a pint if you drink than if you\u2019re teetotal.     The original bad boy. Phwoaar! Eh, ladies? Photograph: Alamy    The research itself didn\u2019t set out to prove that \u201cwomen love bad boys\u201d \u2013 the conclusions just draw attention to the fact that playing up the riskiness of smoking and drinking isn\u2019t likely to be effective in getting young men to quit. But the way studies like this are reported matters greatly, for the same reason it matters when your friend unthinkingly tells you that \u201cnice guys finish last\u201d, or that \u201cWomen Want To F**k Bad Boys\u201d: it feeds into the myth that every human has the same needs and desires, and that consequently we should all adopt animalistic mating strategies in order to succeed. It\u2019s deeply unhelpful \u2013 particularly for young people who are constantly presented with messages on how they should behave, and the ways in which they should manage and deal with their growing sexuality. It\u2019s pretty damn irritating even for grown adults like me, who are still trying to navigate the complexities of sex and love without self-appointed sexperts appearing every five minutes with a new theory based on one study taken out of context. Taking simple conclusions and twisting them into a broad-brush argument that \u201cwomen prefer bad boys\u201d encourages people to change their behaviour \u2013 young lads to be \u201cnaughty\u201d if they want to get the girl, and girls to feel wrong or broken if they fancy the boy with the satchel instead of the motorbike. Ironically, this was pointed out to Tourjee in her article - Tristan Bridges, a professor of sociology at the College at Brockport State University of New York, explained that biological essentialism \u2013 the idea that men and women are \u201cprogrammed\u201d to desire certain things \u2013 has been largely discredited. Mainly, he says, \u201cbecause it relies on stereotypes of early humans, and the adaptive problems they faced that are historically inaccurate and fail to account for much of what we know about how early humans lived.\u201d Instead he points out that any preferences are likely down to socialisation \u2013 men are more likely to \u201cact bad\u201d, and women more likely to prefer them if society repeatedly tells them they should. That\u2019s why poor sex reporting matters, as well as in the more commonly debunked areas such as health and \u201cnutrition\u201d journalism. Each nuanced conclusion taken out of context and run through the headline generator adds more fuel to longstanding myths around sex, gender, and relationships. It\u2019s probably not Tourjee\u2019s fault either \u2013 a constant drive for clickworthy headlines means that any nuance gets swallowed in favour of a hook. But this article is a good example of why we shouldn\u2019t always indulge our desire for simple answers. The statement \u201cwomen prefer bad boys\u201d is tempting because it offers a simple solution for a question which is far more complicated. We hear the myth, it\u2019s reinforced, then repeated, and the cycle continues. By the time we\u2019ve heard these sex myths over and over, we\u2019re all f**ked. Not just the bad boys.
