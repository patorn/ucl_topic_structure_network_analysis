More than 800 volunteers took part in the training exercise at the Trafford Centre in Manchester on Monday night. The mock attack, which took five months to plan, was designed to be similar to the marauding-style Paris and Brussels atrocities. The assistant chief constable, Garry Shewan, released a statement on Tuesday, apologising for linking the exercise with Islam, after the police were criticised on social media following the drill. \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d means God is greatest in Arabic.

We recognise and apologise for the offence that this has caused.\u201d     The moment a mock suicide bomber detonates a fake explosive.

We need to move away from stereotypes if we want to achieve Real learning. A terrorist can be anyone.\u201d  The Community Safety Forum, an anti-Islamophobia organisation, said: \u201cThis sort of thing panders to stereotypes and further divides us. It will increase anti-Muslim hate crime.\u201d     Armed police officers during the exercise. Photograph: Sean Hansford/MEN/PA    Tony Lloyd, the mayor of Greater Manchester and the area\u2019s police and crime commissioner, said the simulated terror attack had been \u201ca very good exercise in preparing for a situation we never want to see, but must be ready for\u201d.  But, he added, it was frustrating that the operation had been \u201cmarred by the ill-judged, unnecessary and unacceptable decision by organisers\u201d to have those playing the parts of terrorists shout the phrase. \u201cIt didn\u2019t add anything to the event, but has the potential to undermine the great community relations we have in Greater Manchester,\u201d he said. The drill, the latest in a series of similar exercises across the country, started at midnight in the food court when a man dressed in black walked in and shouted at the crowd. An explosion was then heard before a masked gunman appeared and began firing shots. Neither the emergency services nor volunteers taking part knew the precise details of the scenario, called Exercise Winchester Accord. Volunteers, wearing ear defenders and safety glasses, screamed as if they were in pain as the exercise unfolded.  The drill lasted for six hours and the shopping centre was open as usual on Tuesday, although the exercise was due to continue unseen and at unspecified locations until Wednesday, when it will finish in Merseyside.",
