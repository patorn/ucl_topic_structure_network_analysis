  "body": "All the talk about who will or won\u2019t do post-election deals with independents and minor parties misses the point \u2013 they might reject formal \u201cdeals\u201d but neither Malcolm Turnbull nor Bill Shorten has yet ruled out leading a minority government reliant on winning enough crossbench support for each bill they try to legislate. Despite the spectacle of both leaders signing a \u201csolemn pledge\u201d drafted by the Daily Telegraph ruling out a \u201cdeal or alliance\u201d with the Greens, neither has ruled out seeking to govern in the event of a hung parliament if enough of the crossbench agreed to the two basic prerequisites \u2013 to support the money bills needed for the government to function and not to support a no-confidence motion moved by the other side. The idea of any formal agreement with crossbenchers was already unlikely because most of the non-Green independents with a reasonable chance of winning have categorically ruled out striking such a deal with either major party and both major party leaders have ruled out such a deal with the Greens (despite the Coalition\u2019s repeated claims that a \u201cLabor/Greens alliance\u201d is looming).   Related: David Leyonhjelm 'disappointed' by resignation of policy adviser Helen Dale    The \u201cformal agreements\u201d struck by Julia Gillard in 2010 were really just designed to give the electorate reassurance, because of the unfamiliarity of minority government. In 2016 the possibility of an informal arrangement is, at the moment, still live. With the polls tightening and a hung parliament at least a possibility, neither leader has been prepared to renounce the idea, or say that in the event of a hung parliament they would prefer another election to such an arrangement. And several crossbenchers who could be the other parties to such an arrangement have told Guardian Australia an informal agreement in which they agree to give one or other party confidence and supply, and then negotiate each bill on its merits, is exactly what they are contemplating in the event that neither major party wins enough seats to govern in its own right. Of course neither Turnbull nor Shorten want to talk about the possibility that they won\u2019t win in their own right on 2 July, so they are both choosing their words carefully. Turnbull said on Monday minority government was a \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d but only ruled out formal \u201cdeals\u201d. \u201cI have made it very clear before ... I am surprised you would have thought it was possible we would be doing deals with the Greens or independents,\u201d he said.   Related: Kristina Keneally on why the leaders' debate doesn't matter \u2013 Behind the Lines podcast    The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, made the reality clear in a recent interview on Radio National. \u201cWe are not interested in any Coalition agreements with any party,\u201d he said. \u201cI wrote about this in my book in 2013; Labor governs alone or not at all. Who parties vote for in a confidence vote is up to them. If there is a confidence vote after the election, and independents and other parties have to choose who to support, that\u2019s a matter for them. We will not be entering into any agreements, coalitions or deals with the Greens or anybody else.\u201d But many crossbenchers are happy to consider informal arrangements. Andrew Wilkie, who stands a good chance of being re-elected in this election in his Tasmanian seat of Denison, ruled out any formal agreement with either party but said in the event of a hung parliament he would \u201cweigh up the outcome of the election and the views of my Denison electorate and make a decision about who I would support on confidence and supply\u201d. \u201cOnce I made that decision I would stick to it as far as possible in the interests of stability,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cIn the end I don\u2019t think it makes much difference whether the agreement is formal or informal. I entered into an agreement with Julia Gillard and then, after 18 months, I ended it and it really didn\u2019t make much difference to how things operated.\u201d Tony Windsor, who has some chance of winning the NSW seat of New England from Barnaby Joyce, says he won\u2019t sign another formal deal but that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be possible to form a functioning parliament.  \u201cIf the election turned out to be dead even, then the prime minister could go back to the polls or assume the treasury benches and form a minority government and test whether Labor could get the numbers for a no confidence motion or could put together his own deal to form government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible for the crossbench to support the government on confidence and supply and deal with everything else on a case by case basis ... that\u2019s basically what we did after 2010. The pieces of paper we signed were really just to show the Australian people the whole thing could be stable.\u201d Windsor concedes an informal approach would mean he didn\u2019t get the sweeteners for his electorate that came with his deal with Gillard in 2010 but he says he wouldn\u2019t be giving up \u201cthe leverage that comes with a hung parliament.\u201d    Related: Liberals yet to finalise western Sydney candidates as Senate ticket hangs in balance    Bob Katter, who is seeking re-election in the north Queensland seat of Kennedy, has said he would present the major parties with the same demands he had in 2010. The sitting independent in the Victorian seat of Indi, Cathy McGowan, says she will do no formal deal, but would look at every piece of legislation that came up as she has done for the past two and a half years and consult with her community. In 2010 Gillard signed agreements with the Greens, and independents Rob Oakeshott, Tony Windsor and Andrew Wilkie. But the reality was not much different to Labor governing with only the basic assurances of supply and confidence. Wilkie ended his deal with Gillard in 2012 and the Greens ended theirs in 2013 and the government continued.",
