  "body": "On Ayumu Goromaru\u2019s own account, until September 19 last year, the nation of Japan \u201cdidn\u2019t even know about rugby itself\u201d. Goromaru, playing in the country\u2019s semi-professional rugby competition with Yamaha, was reportedly earning about the average annual Australian wage (A$80,000) working a day job in a 50 square metre office with 100 colleagues in the corporation\u2019s communications department, a role that included leasing motorcycles to media.  Cue the greatest upset in rugby World Cup history, with Japan\u2019s Brave Blossoms prevailing in a 34-32 cliffhanger against the Springboks in Brighton, UK. \u201cAfter winning against South Africa, the world is different,\u201d Goromaru tells Guardian Australia.   Related: Kurtley Beale reportedly signs \u00a31.5m deal with Wasps    Goromaru, who put 24 of Japan\u2019s points on the board in that sensational opening victory, was named full-back in the tournament\u2019s \u2018Dream Team\u2019 and Japan\u2019s first rugby superstar was born.  Rugby fever gripped that nation of 127 million overnight, with Goromaru\u2019s Jonny Wilkinson-inspired \u201ctrigger\u201d pose before kicking goal becoming a bona fide cultural meme. The pose begat TV advertisements, an official declaration of the man as a \u201cmaster of ninjas\u201d and soaring crowds to a Gifu temple where a 500-year-old Buddhist statue has attracted wry comparisons. Product endorsements made \u201cGoro-san\u201d reportedly the world\u2019s highest paid rugby player, pulling in $340,000 a month, standing bare-chested holding a baby in commercials for soap, while starring in others for fried rice, washing powder, and a new brew of Asahi beer called \u201cThe Dream\u201d. He appreciates it has all helped put rugby on the map in Japan, whose hosting duties for the rugby World Cup are but three years away. But it\u2019s the kind of attention that even the world\u2019s most established rugby stars would struggle to appreciate. \u201cIf it was only myself it would be easier, but with my family, when we were spending relaxing time at home, media or fans came to our home and asked for autographs or photos,\u201d the stocky, six-foot-one-inch Fukuoka native says. \u201cThere were little things that built up, both me and the family became very stressed.\u201d It came to a crescendo when Japan rugby\u2019s biggest fish left that pond for the elite Super Rugby competition with the Queensland Reds in February. \u201cOn the way to Brisbane from Narita, lots of media rushed to us at the airport, trying to take photos of us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got on to the airplane separately and lots of camera men were waiting for them with lots of flashes on my kids and wife, which really shocked and frightened the kids. We were living a stressful life.\u201d It is considered an unusual step for the family of a Japanese sports star to accompany him on the overseas stint, but his wife has lived in Australia on her own before and is reportedly fluent in English. They met while studying at the elite Waseda university in Tokyo. \u201cGoro-san\u201d has reputedly ticked all the marketing boxes for the Reds, his merchandise in the form of fans\u2019 jerseys selling nicely. But it is fair to say he has failed to set the world on fire in his own Reds jersey. A game ago he was dropped from the squad altogether, biding his time as a second-stringer, spending most games sitting forlornly on the bench. Some fans have questioned Reds management\u2019s treatment of Goromaru, saying he hardly has the chance to shine given the minutes he\u2019s been getting.  But Goromaru plays down his expectations. \u201cBefore coming to Australia, I didn\u2019t expect it would be that easy to play from the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cI appreciated and I was glad when I could play quite a bit in the second game, about 50 minutes. I know I need to do well in rugby and I want to meet fans\u2019 expectations, but I have been getting all sorts of good experiences even outside of rugby, so\u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t speak like a man who is crestfallen. Rather, after four years of juggling Yamaha and World Cup training duties that starved him of time with his wife and children, he seems to be rather enjoying his newfound anonymity in suburban Brisbane.  \u201cJapanese people do recognise me and come to talk to me but it doesn\u2019t happen very often as I don\u2019t go to town or where there are lots of people,\u201d he says. He shops locally, goes fishing on his teammate Greg Holmes\u2019s boat. The city itself is \u201cvery slow, relaxed. For example it took us one or two months to get our internet connection done,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes me feel Japanese are trying too hard, too speedy. After coming here, I found everyone had their own lives, not really caring too much about other people, it\u2019s a good atmosphere.\u201d \u201cI have been enjoying not only rugby but personal life here.\u201d  Meanwhile, Japanese media have been dissecting Goromaru\u2019s fortunes in the cauldron of elite rugby, recently declaring he was in the \u201cdai pinchi\u201d \u2013 the \u201cbig pinch\u201d of his career. A national TV panel explored in improbably forensic detail whether the difference between the smooth-surfaced rugby balls in Japan and the rough-textured ones in Super Rugby could be messing with his kicking radar, until expert testimony reminded them he did just fine with bumpy balls in the world cup. But the same segment seized on early comments at a media conference by a Reds coach about communication on the paddock being a critical factor where the import was concerned. For his own part Goromaru \u2013 an articulate and thoughtful communicator in his native tongue \u2013 does consider his command of English a key handicap to making his best fist of the world\u2019s top club rugby competition. Speaking to Guardian Australia through an interpreter after kicking practice at Ballymore this week (yes, he does the pose in practice, too), Goromaru says he never imagined those university English classes would be of much use. \u201cI was always sleeping during uni time,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think I would go overseas to live. I didn\u2019t ever dream of me needing English. I like Japan, Japanese food and life in Japan. But now I really feel I do need English.\u201d Having taken the plunge with the Reds, he says, \u201cI just imagined I could get by somehow, but the reality wasn\u2019t that easy\u201d. He now got a \u201cgood teacher\u201d from Bond university. On-field communication aside, his key obstacle to the number 15 jersey is Karmichael Hunt. Goromaru is regarded as an intelligent player who kicks well, passes well and could get a start with other teams. But in the words of one local observer, he is \u201cnot super quick \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have the gas\u201d of Hunt, who is playing his way into a Wallabies jersey. Nor does Goromaru have Hunt\u2019s versatility, which could have seen him carve out a spot elsewhere in the backline. Goromaru is a \u201cpure full-back\u201d and he\u2019s stuck been behind the code-hopper. Until this Saturday, that is. Hunt\u2019s groin injury has given Goromaru a surprise starting berth against the Hurricanes at Wellington. \u201cBeing able to bring a guy of Ayumu Goromaru\u2019s experience straight into the starting side is a big benefit for us,\u201d interim co-coach Nick Stiles said this week. \u201cThis is a good opportunity for him to step up and demonstrate what we know he is capable of.\u201d This hit-out comes none too soon for Goromaru \u2013 the Reds\u2019 home clash against Japan\u2019s own development side the Sunwolves follows on 21 May, a key moment for the expatriate, and probably rugby at large back home. Asked how badly he wants the minutes to prove his mettle against the Sunwolves, Goromaru says: \u201cI do love to play, especially for the many Japanese fans coming all the way to watch me play. I would like to play as long as possible, any minute counts, but it is totally up to the coaches, so\u2026\u201d \u201cBut I will try hard and keep doing what I can little by little.\u201d Goromaru nominates playing with the Sunwolves as an option next year, although he\u2019s still \u201cnot too sure\u201d. It would be good for Japanese rugby to keep himself and the Sunwolves in Super Rugby action, pitting themselves against the best in the world. Asked why he didn\u2019t team up with the Sunwolves, where he would surely be a walk up starter, he says after the success of the World Cup, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stay in the same warm, comfortable waters\u201d.   \u201cI wanted to try something different, to be considered just one player and not the super star. Overseas in a totally different environment,\u201d he says.  Goromaru also makes a classic \u2018east meets west\u2019 observation about the difference in rugby teamwork in Japan and Australia. \u201cIn Japan, everything is very detailed, they care about little things, good skill, good speed,\u201d he says. \u201cBut here, they care very much about individual skills. We are playing in the team together, but it feels also like we\u2019re playing against each other at the same time.\u201d He relishes this somewhat alien approach to team building. \u201cIf I was still in Japan, I wouldn\u2019t have been in this environment and wouldn\u2019t have experienced it this way,\u201d he says. Beyond the rest of this season, his designs on more quality time with family and on the field \u2013 and hopes of sharpening both his English skills and his big game performance \u2013 Japan and the 2019 World Cup still beckons. \u201cWe have just started with Japan rugby, the first step,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we could make a big step.\u201d",
