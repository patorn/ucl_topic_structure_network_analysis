  "body": "It was never going to be the easiest of school reunions. So it was probably just as well it took place on neutral Conservative territory at Grey Court school in Richmond. Love triangles don\u2019t come much more complicated than David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Zac Goldsmith. Dave hates Boris because Boris hopes to steal his job after the EU referendum. Dave hates Zac because Zac is in favour of leaving the EU and opposes a third runway at Heathrow. Boris hates Dave because Dave is in the way, but isn\u2019t really bothered about Zac one way or the other as he isn\u2019t really worth thinking about. Zac doesn\u2019t particularly dislike Dave or Boris but he really hates himself. Zac is embarrassed he hasn\u2019t had the cojones to stand up to Lynton Crosby\u2019s campaign management and now looks as if he doesn\u2019t want \u2013 let alone expect \u2013 to be the next London mayor. But needs must and sometime or other in the campaign the three men had to get together in the same place, and with just 48 hours before the polls open on Thursday, it was now or never. Dave, though, had been canny, timing his arrival carefully to be 30 minutes late in order to make sure he missed the Six O\u2019Clock News; it was bad enough having to spend time with Boris and Zac, but if he had to do so then he was going to make sure that as few people as possible got to witness his embarrassment. Apart from anything else, Zac was almost certainly going to lose and Dave didn\u2019t want to be seen hanging around with losers.   Related: So Dave\u2019s not so fond of Boris now. Can politicians ever be friends? | David Boyle    At 6.15, the three non-amigos unconvincingly fist-pumped their way through the crowd of bussed-in party loyalists and squeezed their way on to a cramped podium in the school theatre. \u201cYo,\u201d squeaked Dave, dredging up every millilitre of spare testosterone. \u201cYo,\u201d roared Boris, puffing out his chest. Silence. Dave and Boris both turned towards Zac. Zac blushed. \u201cOh yes,\u201d he said politely. \u201cYo.\u201d Dave was quick to get his insults in early. \u201cBoris has been an outstanding mayor,\u201d he said, not bothering to disguise the sarcasm. That was \u201coutstanding\u201d as in failing to build any houses, closing dozens of police and fire stations, making it impossible to drive from one side of the capital to the other and proving that being mayor was basically a part-time job that could be fitted in around some freelance writing and being an MP. \u201cZac will be equally outstanding.\u201d Zac winced. \u201cZac is a man with a plan,\u201d Dave continued. He wasn\u2019t exactly sure what it was, but it didn\u2019t really matter as it wasn\u2019t going to happen anyway. A voice rang in his earpiece. It was Lynton instructing him to insult the Labour candidate. \u201cThe only thing you have to know about Sadiq Khan is \u2026\u201d Dave left the sentence hanging, leaving the audience to fill in the blank of Muslim. By the time he finished the sentence by saying \u201ca member of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party\u201d, no one was listening.   Related: London mayoralty: Sadiq Khan urges voters to choose hope over fear    Next up was Boris, happy to say next to nothing of any value so long as he got more laughs than Dave. Having achieved this with ease, he announced he was going to introduce the next London mayor. Zac turned round to look for him. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d he whispered anxiously. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Boris. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a game of Let\u2019s Pretend. So just get up there and do your stuff.\u201d Zac shuffled his way to the front. \u201cEr, hello everyone,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cThank you all for coming here tonight, I\u2019m really grateful. I\u2019ve got a really good plan for this capital which is really, really exciting and is much better than anyone else\u2019s. And if you don\u2019t vote for me then you will probably all get blown up in a terrorist incident because that\u2019s the sort of thing that will happen if you vote for Sadiq Khan. So I want you to all campaign really hard in the last two days so that we can all say we did our best and when it\u2019s all over we can have a nice cappuccino together.\u201d It was not the most convincing of sales pitches, so Dave and Boris stepped in to try to outcompete each other in manly thumbs ups. Eventually Zac got the hint and gave an embarrassed thumbs up himself. The audience began a rallying cry of \u201cGo Zac, Go Zac.\u201d So he went.",
