  "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp believes his first seven months at Liverpool will provide the foundation for a major improvement next season. Klopp takes charge of his 50th game as Liverpool manager on Wednesday when Chelsea visit for the final home game of the season. The contest pits eighth against ninth in the Premier League, a far cry from recent title challenges by the two clubs, but the German insists he has gathered enough evidence to know that position will not be repeated next season. \u201cI\u2019m not too interested in when Chelsea can next win the title and I have no idea when we can but I promise we will try everything to build on the base of this season,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe can get sixth position. It isn\u2019t the biggest success in the history of Liverpool but everyone interested in Liverpool can see the good signs and we will build on it. We have to improve and I am sure we will. A lot of things need to be perfect for a really good season. I\u2019m really looking forward to next season, to pre-season, but this season we are still looking for what we can get.\u201d   Related: Uefa unbowed by Liverpool and Sevilla\u2019s need for a bigger Europa League boat | Barry Glendenning    Liverpool can still embellish their season with victory in the Europa League final against Sevilla and secure Champions League qualification with it but Klopp will not allow any letup in the remaining league games against Chelsea and at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday. He said: \u201cIf we lose the next two games, believe me I will go to Basel confident but it would feel better if we have won these two games. Sevilla changed 11 positions in the last game and all you read is that Sevilla is not ready for the final. They are already preparing for the final. We can\u2019t do this. We are not in a fixed position in the table like they are. That is their way but our way is to be focused on Chelsea and West Brom and to try to get sixth before the final. We will try everything for sure.\u201d Klopp confirmed the Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, has resumed light training after sustaining a knee ligament injury in the Europa League quarter-final at Borussia Dortmund. He expects the midfielder to be fully fit for England\u2019s European Championship campaign but will have to wait on Henderson\u2019s recovery in time for the Europa League final. \u201cThere is really good news on Hendo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to rest him with his injury for a long time and he could not do a lot. We tried everything to avoid surgery and the surgeon has said it is not necessary. Yesterday he trained, not with the team, and it looks good. It was only passing and running but it\u2019s looking good step by step. It\u2019s only nine days until the final, so not sure about that but 100% he will be fit for the Euros. That\u2019s good, but for our games we are not sure.\u201d Divock Origi, who has been sidelined since damaging ankle ligaments against Everton three weeks ago, has an outside chance of being fit to face Sevilla. Klopp said: \u201cOrigi is already training but not with the team. He is passing and running but we don\u2019t have to make a decision on him yet. He is quicker than we thought, like Emre Can. The physios and coaches have done a good job but we cannot force it. He is in a better way than we thought the day after the injury.\u201d",
