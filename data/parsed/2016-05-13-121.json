The deletion sparked accusations of censorship against the social network, which has often been accused of siding with the Turkish government in battles over free speech. But Facebook says it did not delete the page, and Zed Books has accepted the claim. Both companies say they are trying to discover how the page was removed from the site, and who by. Zed Books, an independent publisher founded in 1976, found its Facebook page deleted outright on Tuesday, without any warning or notification. It said its attempts to contact Facebook for an official statement on why its page was removedhad gone unanswered, and that it had been given no timeframe for recovering it. After the Guardian contacted Facebook over the issue, Facebook got in touch with Zed Books, and told the Guardian: \u201cFacebook has not taken Zed Books page down. We are in contact with them to help understand what has happened and to resolve the situation.\u201d Following Facebook\u2019s statement, Zed Books said \u201cFacebook have been in contact and told us they did not remove our page. We\u2019re happy to acknowledge that this is the case. We\u2019ve asked that our page be restored. \u201cWe\u2019ve also asked for clarification regarding Facebook\u2019s community standards; specifically, whether we can continue to promote academic titles on the PKK, post maps and images of Kurdistan, refer to Abdullah \u00d6calan and make posts that may contain criticism of the Erdo\u011fan government on Facebook. We\u2019ve not yet had confirmation that this content is permitted on Facebook.\u201d Zed Books recently published Turkey: The Insane and the Melancholy by Ece Temelkuran, a journalist who was fired from Turkey\u2019s Habert\u00fcrk newspaper in 2012 for criticising the government\u2019s killing of 35 Kurdish civilians. It has also published The PKK: Coming Down from the Mountains, a book by Paul White, which examines the evolution of the party. The deletion of its page followed a series of posts on both books, Zed says. In a statement, the publisher added: \u201cWe have requested further clarification from Facebook as to the reasons for our page\u2019s removal, but have thus far received no response. However, we are worried that the removal of our company\u2019s Facebook page may be part of a pattern of suppression against the distribution and promotion of academic research and books related to the current Turkish administration and their ongoing war with Kurdish separatists.\u201d Civil liberties groups have called on Facebook to reinstate Zed\u2019s page. Jo Glanville, the director of English PEN, said: \u201cThis appears to be an extremely disturbing instance of censorship. Ece Temelkuran is a highly regarded author and journalist, one of many to have fallen foul of the increasingly authoritarian regime in Turkey. \u201cThe government\u2019s assault on social media is part of its campaign to silence the Turkish population and allow no space for civil society or the media. We are now seeing a new trend: the censoring of criticism of Turkey within Europe. It is imperative that Facebook stands firm in support of free speech.\u201d Jim Killock, Executive Director of Open Rights Group said: \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan\u2019s attempts to silence his critics in Turkey are well documented. But this is a UK Facebook page for an academic publisher based in London\u2026 We hope that Facebook is not facilitating attacks on free speech.\u201d On Tuesday, Facebook removed the profile of a Dutch MP, Keklik Y\u00fccel, for several hours after she published a piece criticising the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The company denied that the account was removed because of her comments, telling the state broadcaster NOS: \u201cWe want to emphasise that temporarily taking an account offline has nothing to do with the MP\u2019s political comments.\u201d Under Erdo\u011fan, Turkey has become increasingly hostile to freedom of speech. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists described press freedoms as \u201cunder siege\u201d in March, in a letter to the country\u2019s prime minister, and called on him to \u201censure that your country meets its commitments under international law, including its commitments to free expression\u201d. New media has not been immune to Turkish repression, with Twitter reporting that more than 70% of its takedown requests in the first half of 2015 came from Turkish authorities. And back in 2012, leaked documents from a Facebook contractor charged with moderating posts revealed that Turkey was the only nation to have specific censorship rules put in place: \u201cMaps of Kurdistan (Turkey)\u201d and \u201cBurning Turkish flag(s)\u201d were two things which the company required moderators to escalate to a higher level of moderation, while \u201cPKK support and depiction\u201d is \u201cconfirmed\u201d as an abuse standards violation. The PKK is designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US State Department and as a proscribed group by the UK Home Office. \u2022 This story was updated at 6pm GMT on Friday 13 May to clarify that Facebook did not delete Zed Books\u2019 page itself, as an earlier version of this story claimed, following new information.",
