  "body": "Travel guide publisher Lonely Planet has released its annual list of the best places to visit in Europe, this year opting for a mix of the usual suspects (Venice, the Dordogne) and a scattering of off-the-beaten track places such as the Dutch island of Texel. Topping the list is the the Peloponnese, a region often overlooked by travellers to Greece, who tend to visit the islands or build a sightseeing trip around Athen\u2019s iconic Acropolis. The region is described as \u201can affordable enclave of magnificent ancient sights like Olympia, Mycenae and Mystra\u201d. The recently opened Menalon trail provides a new way to explore the region, which is popular with hikers.      Aarhus is praised for its contemporary architecture, such as the Aarhus Kunstmuseum    Second on the list is Aarhus in Denmark (which next year will be the European Capital of Culture and European Region of Gastronomy), praised for its contemporary architecture, new public spaces on the harbour front and Michelin-star restaurants. Third spot goes to tourist favourite Venice, which is commemorating the 500th anniversary of the Venetian ghetto this year.  Less obvious locations that make the top 10 include Lviv in Ukraine, home to dozens of festivals over the summer, and Extremadura in Spain, described as one of the \u201cleast known regions in one of Europe\u2019s best known countries\u201d.

Though the island\u2019s deserted sand beaches and dunescapes are popular with Dutch and German visitors, it remains relatively unknown further afield. The UK county of Warwickshire also makes it on to the list, with the Statford-upon-Avon\u2019s celebrations to commemorate the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare\u2019s death, deemed a good reason to visit this year.
