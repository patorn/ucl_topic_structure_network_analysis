  "body": "When the government released the latest education white paper in March, the plan to force all schools to become academies drew the most headlines. The Department for Education probably expected less pushback to the announcement that schools will no longer need to keep two spaces for elected parent governors. The one-sentence proposal, on page 51 of the document, states: \u201cWe will expect all governing boards to focus on seeking people with the right skills for governance, and so we will no longer require academy trusts to reserve places for elected parents on governing boards.\u201d But there was pushback \u2013 a lot of it. Education secretary Nicky Morgan published a blog on Mumsnet the day after the report\u2019s publication, and it quickly received 1,000 comments \u2013 the maximum a post can get.    Nobody wants to be governed by people\u200b they never see    The vast majority were less than impressed. One user wrote: \u201cEmpowering parents by removing parent governors. By denying parents choice. Classic double think.\u201d Another asked: \u201cIf you want parents to have a stronger voice, why are you doing away with parent governors? Why change from a system with democratically elected stakeholders, to a system with remote, skills-based governors instead, who represent business rather than the parents and the local community?\u201d Morgan did not respond, although David Cameron has since sought to defend the government\u2019s position, highlighting the \u201cfreedom\u201d offered by the change. So why are people so concerned? \u201cOur worry is that these boards will only bring in people they know and become very inward-looking,\u201d says Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governors\u2019 Association (NGA). \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a theoretical argument \u2013 we\u2019re seeing it start to happen in some academies already. When you look at the list of job titles, you think: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a high-powered board.\u2019 But they don\u2019t always govern well because they don\u2019t always understand the implications of decisions.\u201d What parent governors bring, she says, is a different perspective. They provide a unique angle on the issues affecting the school community, calling on knowledge and experience that other governors simply do not have.  Sarah Bamford, vice-chair of the board of governors at Redlands primary school in Reading, says parents\u2019 personal investment in the success of a school is key. \u201cWho cares more than a parent? This is why it seems bonkers not to have to have them on the governing board.\u201d  Just as crucial, she continues, is the fact that parent governors have a presence in the community, which can help concerns to come to light. \u201cIf you are a parent, in primary schools especially, you are quite visible,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be seen as part of a secret cabal \u2013 nobody wants to be governed by people they never see.\u201d    Related: Where are all the young school governors?    Knights agrees. \u201cThe government has neglected to think about the fact that schools are public services, they\u2019re not corporate,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve misunderstood the idea of collective attachment and collective ownership of a service. I think they saw it as a small, technical adjustment \u2013 I don\u2019t think they realised how this would be perceived.\u201d  This is not to say that there aren\u2019t issues with parent governors, of course. The NGA released a report last month to address arguments they hear against parent governors, including that some can be disruptive and divert focus from the issues at hand. Others argue that parents are bound to steer discussion towards issues that affect their own children.  But this is where good training is essential. Policing what issues are raised with the board is the job of the chair, Knights argues. Moreover, if parents have been properly briefed about their remit, Knights says, they should know that their role is to govern in the interests of the entire school, not just their own interests. Bamford has also encountered this misunderstanding: \u201cThe election process for parent governors can give the impression that you are putting someone forward to represent the people and that\u2019s not what the role is at all. I do see how they [parents] could be disruptive in that situation, but with good training, there\u2019s no reason that should be the case.\u201d  Appropriate training would also address the government\u2019s concerns about the current level of skill on governing boards. \u201cYou have to induct governors \u2013 it\u2019s a really complex, difficult role,\u201d Knights says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just invite people in and give them a bunch of papers and expect them to know what their responsibility is.\u201d The white paper proposes to empower parents in a different way. In her Mumsnet blog, Morgan writes: \u201cI am well aware that the education system can appear complex to many parents. I am dedicated to changing this once and for all, and putting the control firmly back in your hands.    Related: 10 top tips for effective school governance    \u201cI plan to introduce a new, online parents portal from as early as next year. This portal will enable parents\u2019 access to key information and allow you to support your child\u2019s learning.\u201d This was met with a less than rapturous response. One commenter asked: \u201cHow does giving us a portal which allows us to read information and support our children\u2019s learning give us a voice?\u201d The challenge of engaging parents in issues of governance is a long-running one. Knights highlights the fact that most schools already offer a parents\u2019 portal, and they are often underused. Others try to gather views through surveys, but response rates can vary. Even in schools where attendance at parents\u2019 evening is high, she says, it can be difficult to instigate meaningful discussion on topics such as curriculum changes and extra-curricular offerings.  There can be a number of reasons for this; some parents don\u2019t feel equipped to challenge the status quo, while many are just too busy. The NGA has been trying to update its briefings on the topic with examples of good practice, but is struggling to get hold of examples. \u201cWe\u2019ve put a call-out if people are doing parent engagement well, not in terms of individual children, but holding schools to account, and let\u2019s just say we\u2019re not being flooded with responses,\u201d Knights says. \u201cThe establishment isn\u2019t set up to help schools do this in a way that\u2019s meaningful rather than tokenistic. There will be some schools doing it well, but there isn\u2019t knowledge of how to do this properly across the system.\u201d The school governors series is funded by Zurich Municipal.
