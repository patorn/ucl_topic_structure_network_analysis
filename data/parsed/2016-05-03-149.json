  "body": "An interesting question is, what are you waiting for?  Global warming is the biggest problem we\u2019ve ever faced as a civilisation \u2014 certainly you want to act to slow it down, but perhaps you\u2019ve been waiting for just the right moment.   The moment when, oh, marine biologists across the Pacific begin weeping in their scuba masks as they dive on reefs bleached of life in a matter of days. The moment when drought in India gets deep enough that there are armed guards on dams to prevent the theft of water. The moment when we record the hottest month ever measured on the planet, and then smash that record the next month, and then smash that record the next month? The moment when scientists reassessing the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet have what one calls an \u2018OMG moment\u2019 and start talking about massive sea level rise in the next 30 years?   That would be this moment \u2013 the moment when 135 children have drowned in Thailand trying to cool off from the worst heatwave on record there. The moment when, in a matter of months, we\u2019ve recorded the highest windspeeds ever measured in the western and southern hemispheres.  For years people have patiently and gently tried to nudge us on to a new path for dealing with our climate and energy troubles \u2013 we\u2019ve had international conferences and countless symposia and lots and lots and lots of websites. And it\u2019s sort of worked\u2014the world met in Paris last December and announced it would like to hold temperature increases to 1.5C or less. Celebration ensued. But what also ensued was February, when the planet\u2019s temperature first broke through that 1.5C barrier. And as people looked past the rhetoric, they saw that the promises made in Paris would add up to a world 3.5C warmer\u2014an impossible world. The world we\u2019re starting to see take shape around us.   So there\u2019s a need to push harder. A need, as it were, to break free from some of the dogma that\u2019s surrounded this issue for a very long time. Yes, we need to have \u201ceveryone work together.\u201d Yes, we need a \u201cmulti-faceted, global effort.\u201d But you know what we really need? We need to keep oil and gas and coal in the ground, keep it from being burned and adding its freight of carbon to the global total.  Which is why, from one end of the planet to the other, people are taking greater risks this month. In one of the biggest coordinated civil disobedience actions the world has ever seen, frontline communities and climate scientists and indigenous people and faith leaders and just plain people who actually give a damn will be sitting down and sitting in and standing pat\u2014blocking, at least for a few hours, those places where the coal and oil and gas currently reside, in the hopes of helping keep them there.  In Australia they\u2019ll be taking to kayaks at the world\u2019s largest coal port in Newcastle, and in Brazil it\u2019s the fracking onslaught they\u2019re opposing. In Vancouver they\u2019ll be surrounding a new proposed oil terminal on the coast, and in Indonesia they\u2019ll be outside the presidential palace in Jakarta. Coal will be the target in the Philippines and Turkey and the UK; oil in Nigeria; gas in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado\u2014on and on around the planet, a swell of people saying the time has come.

The time has come to show that we understand we\u2019re in this together across borders and boundaries.  The time has come to take action commensurate with the scale of the problem. Yes, risking arrest is harder than signing a Facebook petition. But experience has shown it can often work\u2014that\u2019s what kicked the fight against the Keystone pipeline into high gear, turning it into the highest profile defeat of the oil industry in a generation. That\u2019s what made it impossible for Shell to keep drilling in the Arctic, and for Adani to find the funds they need to build Earth\u2019s biggest coal mine.  Not everyone can do it\u2014there are regimes that are too authoritarian for anyone to dare even peaceful civil disobedience of this kind. But for those of us who still live in places theoretically committed to freedom, it\u2019s time to put that privilege to use. The planet is well outside its comfort zone\u2014that\u2019s what it means when whole ecosystems are obliterated in a matter of days. Which means its time for us to be there too.",
