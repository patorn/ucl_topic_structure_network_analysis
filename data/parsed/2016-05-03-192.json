One is plagued by corruption and debt, and dotted with crumbling homes, abandoned by families for the imperial power nearby. The other is Cuba. Who won the cold war again? Within 24 hours on Sunday, Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, announced that the American territory would default on nearly $370m of debt, after years of failure to put the island\u2019s finances \u2013 or its relationship with the US \u2013 in order. The next morning a cruise ship full of tourists set sail for Havana, bringing American dreams, dollars and capitalist sense into Cuba\u2019s future. Once seen as parallel case studies in cold war politics, the islands have seemingly switched roles. For half a century, the US dominated Puerto Rico and Cuba after wrenching them away from Spain, but by the 1950s the islands parted ways. Cubans threw off a US-backed dictator, found new patrons in the Soviet Union and embraced communism. What nationalist fervor Puerto Rico had was quashed, and the colony stayed bound to US-controlled capitalism as a \u201cfree associated state\u201d.  \u201cWhen the cold war was going on they were like showcases for the world to see which system actually works,\u201d said Harry Franqui-Rivera, a researcher at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. \u201cA successful Cuba made the United States look bad and if Puerto Rico failed it would make the United States look worse.\u201d   Related: Smiles all around after Obama's Cuba visit \u2013 but which side got more out of it?    Twenty-five years after the fall of the Soviet Union, US textbooks usually say capitalism won and communism lost, and on a historic mission to Cuba last month Barack Obama said as much: \u201cI have come here to bury the last remnant of the cold war in the Americas.\u201d But experts and activists say the cold war had a murky end, at least in the Caribbean, and that the future for Puerto Rico and Cuba remains far from certain. The day of Obama\u2019s keynote speech in Havana, the mayor of San Juan tweeted: \u201cObama spoke of opening bonds of collaboration with the neighboring island of Cuba while he makes bonds of repression and control in Puerto Rico.\u201d       Franqui-Rivera, whose views do not represent those of his university, said that the fall of the Soviet Union ended decades of boosting Puerto Rico\u2019s economy. \u201cOnce the cold war ended that incentive was no longer there.\u201d Then Congress let corporate tax breaks expire, and Puerto Rico\u2019s economy ground to a halt, dependent on aid, restricted in trade, and increasingly unable to enforce its own laws. Last year its governor called the island\u2019s $70bn debt \u201cunpayable\u201d, and the supreme court and Congress will consider whether to give San Juan bankruptcy powers it lacks. The island also faces crises in education and healthcare, and suffered the first US death linked to the Zika virus last week.     Barack Obama and a monument to Che Guevara on Havana.

Pulitzer-winning playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda has called for help, while a group calling itself the Center for Individual Freedom has aligned itself with Wall Street firms holding the island\u2019s debt, and spent about $200,000 on ads urging Congress not to give the island bankruptcy powers. \u201cTheir economy is so much under the gun of history and US and foreign investor control,\u201d said Lillian Guerra, a historian at the University of Florida, \u201cthat there\u2019s no solution there on the island alone. \u201cThe US government, to the degree it has any interest in Puerto Rico, is interested in keeping it as stable as possible because 10% of the landmass is military bases.\u201d Guerra noted that the dysfunctional system of shared authority, in which San Juan ostensibly governs itself but relies entirely on Washington, has bred vast corruption. Dozens of officials in both parties and the police have faced corruption charges in the last 20 years, including those close to governors. The US Department of Justice has tried repeatedly to prosecute, to limited effect. \u201cThe US doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on in terms of its legitimacy over Puerto Rico,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cPoliticians are interested in primary voters there but have nothing to offer. The only thing that would help is massive revision of the nature of the existing state and that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d In Cuba, the Castro brothers have cracked open doors to Americans and wallets to their dollars, but some experts warn that diplomats\u2019 optimism puts an undue gloss on the real woes of the economy. For all its woes Puerto Rico still has a higher per capita GDP than Cuba, according to the World Bank, and Cuba\u2019s maze-like bureaucracy is made yet more complex by the use of two currencies. The communist island also depends hugely on support from Venezuela, itself near default, and the leniency of foreign creditors.

Rumors and reports have for years spread stories of Fidel Castro\u2019s wealth and the rewards doled out to dutiful communists and the \u201cmilitary oligarchy\u201d. Crackdowns on dissidents continue, and the state levies high taxes on entrepreneurs and private business. Tourism may represent Cuba\u2019s best chance for recovery, said Carmelo Mesa-Lago, an economist and the author of more than a dozen books about Cuba. But a \u201ctsunami of American tourists\u201d are coming and the island has virtually none of the room or amenities to handle them, he said. \u201cRa\u00fal\u2019s motto is \u2018go slow and steadily\u2019,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think they don\u2019t have the luxury to go slower. The only explanation is there is no unity in the party. It does something with one hand and the left does something else.\u201d The state has tried to keep tourism in a vise \u2013 especially its newer luxury resorts and cruise ship contracts. \u201cIf US corporations, like Royal Caribbean, continue to help Ra\u00fal create an enclave type of tourism, it\u2019s very unlikely that the majority of Cubans outside of Havana will benefit,\u201d Guerra said, noting that the exclusive hotels also help Castro control what tourists see of Cuba.

Reckless development on those islands has also damaged coral reefs and forests \u2013 the same sites that drive tourism. Puerto Rico, for instance, has recently tried to woo financiers with huge tax breaks, and in turn raised working class taxes to compensate. Millionaires have flocked to buy real estate and Puerto Ricans \u2013 all American citizens \u2013 have fled en masse to the mainland. \u201cThe population just feels abandoned,\u201d Guerra said, recalling recent trips to San Juan. \u201cThey\u2019ve just given up. They\u2019re saying \u2018es una mierda\u2019.\u201d  Cuba also has a population problem: its people are among the oldest in Latin America, have few children, and its educated professionals are leaving for better work abroad. Rich Villar, a Puerto Rican poet and activist, argued the islands appeared to be coming full circle. \u201cHistorically Cuba and Puerto Rico have both been playgrounds for large-scale US interests,\u201d he said, noting the arrival of hotel chains and cruise ships on one and hedge funds on the other. \u201cPeople are desperate for land of their own and watching outsiders claim land where you were born. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a land grab,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s history repeating itself.\u201d",
