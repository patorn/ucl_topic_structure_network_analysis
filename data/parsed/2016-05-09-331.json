  "body": "Ratchet & ClankPS4, Sony, cert 7 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 At a very base level, the 11th Ratchet & Clank game is a fairly conventional 3D\u00a0platformer, which sees its titular duo jump, smash and shoot their way\u00a0to\u00a0saving the galaxy. But this latest\u00a0in the\u00a0long-running series from the developer Insomniac \u2013 based on the forthcoming film, which is itself based on the\u00a0very\u00a0first\u00a0Ratchet & Clank from 2002 \u2013 offers a great deal more than the sum of its parts. It is, firstly, a quite beautiful game with abundant tongue-in-cheek charisma. Delivered as a playfully misremembered retelling of the first release, its pacing, personality, level design, audio and energy are superbly implemented. And while it is both linear\u00a0and familiar, there\u2019s plenty of\u00a0motivation to replay and explore each\u00a0nook and cranny. Ratchet & Clank\u2019s return does not reinvent the 3D platformer but why should it? The level of polish and craft throughout is striking, clearly demonstrating Insomniac\u2019s experience of \u2013 and love for \u2013 a genre that they have absolutely mastered. WF     Donkey Kong Country remains as innovative as ever.    Donkey Kong CountryNew 3DS, Nintendo, cert 7 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Nintendo\u2019s decision to re-release a number of classic SNES games on New 3DS (and only on New 3DS, unfortunately) does a great deal to highlight just how wonderful the 25-year-old console was. Donkey Kong Country was a revolution when it first launched in 1994. Renowned at the time for its smile-inducing soundtrack, compelling platform gameplay and visuals that were unmatched thanks to new technology that allowed characters to be rendered in 3D. Twenty-two years later, the title remains as innovative as gamers will remember. The variety in gameplay is a joy, with Donkey and Diddy swinging on ropes, bouncing on tyres, flinging barrels, riding rhinos (and, of course, swordfish, ostriches and frogs) and careering at high speeds on runaway mine carts. It\u2019s also a blast in co-op. To be fair, it\u2019s not perfect, the platforming isn\u2019t as tight as Mario, it\u2019s a short game and there are a number of difficulty spikes. Yet these are minor flaws. Donkey Kong Country is as essential today as it was back in 1994. CD     Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games is \u2018simplistic and lacking in depth\u2019.    Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games3DS, Nintendo, cert 7 \u2605\u2605 Arriving months ahead of the Wii U and\u00a0arcade versions this summer, the Sega-developed Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games hits the 3DS in ample time for players to brush up on their Portuguese pronunciation. It marks the fifth entry in the bizarre video game mascot to real-world sporting event crossover. The title bundles 14 of the expected Olympic sports from the 100-metre sprint, to cycling and swimming. Controls for these events are often questionable, and even the games that do \u201cwork\u201d are simplistic and lacking in the depth to reward repeat play. These are bound together by an RPG-lite hub world that has you collecting clothes and grinding experience points to level up the stats. It\u2019s functional, but lacks the finesse of the brilliant Camelot-developed Nintendo sports games. Sadly, this is a by-the-numbers cash-in on a lucrative licence with little entertainment value to all but the youngest audiences. RH",
