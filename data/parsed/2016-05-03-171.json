With just one full day of campaigning left before Thursday\u2019s elections, Ruth Davidson said her party\u2019s internal polling leaves her confident that the Tories will be returned as the official opposition to the SNP. \u201cWe know what the crossover point is, we know the percentage that we need to get past Labour, and we\u2019re there,\u201d she said.   Related: 5 May: your guide to this week's local and mayoral elections    With polling consistently placing the SNP at about 50%, the nationalists are expected to win the majority of constituency seats, with Labour and the Conservatives locked in an unprecedented battle for second place over the remaining regional list seats. Polling for the Daily Record published on Tuesday morning shows the parties are neck and neck, but Davidson told the Guardian she believes the Tories are marginally ahead.  Acknowledging that the Holyrood voting system, which selects the list seats proportionately, is difficult to predict, Davidson said: \u201cI think it will be close. I think you\u2019ll be able to count on the fingers of one hand the difference between us but I think our nose is in front. I think it\u2019s on.\u201d Conservative strategists have extrapolated from recent YouGov figures that up to 150,000 voters, who backed the UK in the 2014 independence referendum and then supported Labour or the Lib Dems in last year\u2019s general election, could switch to Davidson\u2019s party, which is targeting them with its core messages of strong opposition to the SNP and defence of the union.

Davidson\u2019s final week strategy is also based on an understanding that the constitution remains the defining faultline in Scottish politics. She believes the independence question is heavily informing voters\u2019 decision-making some 20 months after the referendum.  The Tory leader has underlined her party\u2019s unionist credentials throughout the campaign, pledging to oppose a second independence referendum no matter what the outcome of June\u2019s EU vote and directly matching the SNP\u2019s plans for a summer independence drive with her own initiative to state the positive case for the union. She has also baited the Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, over the strength of her pro-union leadership. Voters who backed remaining in the UK, according to Davidson, \u201cby and large want someone who will validate the decision they made just 20 months ago\u201d. She includes in this category many older, working-class Labour voters, \u201cwho look at Jeremy Corbyn and run a mile\u201d.  \u201cThere is also a frustration from people who don\u2019t support the SNP and just want someone to take them on. There\u2019s a lot there for any party that says \u2018we will stand up for the decision you made\u2019. For some people that\u2019s an attractive offer when they see a bit of chaos and confusion in the Labour party both north and south of the border.\u201d           How long can the SNP own Scottish politics?    Davidson is not precious about the fact that such voters may lend her their support on a short-term arrangement. \u201cThere\u2019s also that latent sense of Scottish fairness: \u2018We gave Labour two chances and the SNP are still rampant, let\u2019s give someone else a go.\u2019 And they look at me and think \u2018aye her, she\u2019ll do\u2019. I\u2019m not pretending these people love the Conservative party and are going to vote for us forever.\u201d Scottish Tory candidates, who describe themselves as \u201cwith Ruth Davidson\u2019s team\u201d rather than \u201cConservative\u201d on the doorstep, say their leader\u2019s personal popularity and promotion as the only woman to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon cuts through powerfully. One candidate also told the Guardian that animosity towards David Cameron and George Osborne was \u201cthe hardest thing to overcome on the doors\u201d. The prime minister has been notably absent in the final weeks of campaigning in Scotland, amid reports of fears that his dire approval ratings north of the border and recent questions over his tax affairs could damage Davidson\u2019s chances. Did she tell Cameron not to come to Scotland? \u201cNo,\u201d she says briskly, \u201cwe had a conversation and he gets that I\u2019m in charge of this. It\u2019s the first election that\u2019s wholly about me and he trusts me to get on with it.\u201d Davidson has worked hard to distance herself from the more elitist form of Conservatism that dominates. \u201cWe have huge support from working-class areas right across the UK. We used to have that in Scotland and we lost it and one of the things I\u2019ve been working hard to do is bring it back. We will never be as significant a movement in Scotland as we can be if we don\u2019t get it back,\u201d she says.",
