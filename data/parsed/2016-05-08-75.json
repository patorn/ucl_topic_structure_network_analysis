Related: What do Labour voters think of the party's election performance?    Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour\u2019s former deputy leader, said their heavy defeat, coming third behind the Tories, was chiefly because the party failed to represent the hundreds of thousands of former Labour voters who were still focused on the country\u2019s future in the UK.  Sarwar, who is expected to take a senior frontbench role after winning a Holyrood seat on Thursday, said finding a middle way between nationalism and unionism was the \u201cfundamental challenge\u201d still facing the party.  He added: \u201cWe tried perhaps too early to move past the referendum. [I] don\u2019t think the electorate is there yet. People are still thinking about the yes or no question.\u201d Ruth Davidson, now the darling of the Tories for overseeing a Scottish Conservative renaissance after nearly two decades as a marginal force in Scottish politics, hinted on Sunday that she would consider joining a future Tory cabinet in London or even bidding to be prime minister. She told Andrew Neil on the BBC Sunday Politics programme it was still appropriate for a Scottish Tory MP to take a senior role in a UK cabinet despite the substantial devolution to Scotland of tax and law-making powers and new Westminster rules restricting votes on English-only legislation. Davidson said it was conceivable that an MP from a Scottish constituency could be prime minister. Labour had Scottish MPs as chancellor, UK transport secretary, home secretary and health secretary after Holyrood was set up.

Talent will out.\u201d She claimed the Tories had deprived the SNP of a majority and had now killed off any realistic chance of a second referendum in the near future.  \u201cThey have slipped back,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cPeak \u2018Nat\u2019 has now passed and [now] they don\u2019t have this clear majority, that takes the idea of a second referendum off the table for five years and gives Scotland the stability it requires.\u201d  Nicola Sturgeon, who won 63 seats on Thursday, two short of the number needed for a majority, confirmed on Sunday she would press on with plans for a summer initiative by the SNP to reinvigorate the case for independence.  But she said her priority was to govern \u201cin an inclusive way\u201d by finding agreements with other parties. Sturgeon will now focus on striking deals with the two minority parties, the Scottish Greens and Scottish Liberal Democrats, to push through her manifesto pledges and her budget. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not prepared to do, given the scale of the SNP\u2019s mandate in the election, is to allow opposition parties to undermine our ability to implement that manifesto,\u201d she said.  Sarwar\u2019s intervention adds to growing pressure on Dugdale to agree that Scottish Labour should investigate home rule, a form of federal arrangement in which Holyrood has more control over taxation, welfare services and law-making.  Under that model, Westminster would chiefly control foreign policy, defence and perhaps some major spending areas such as pensions. In an implied criticism of Dugdale\u2019s strategy of sidelining the constitutional question by putting a 50p tax rate for the rich at the centre of Labour\u2019s manifesto, Sarwar told BBC Sunday Politics his party had failed to find a clear cause on the constitution. The SNP had independence and the Scottish Tories, now Holyrood\u2019s second-largest party with 31 seats, had made hardline unionism its cause. But voters were not \u201cready and willing to listen to us\u201d because it had no clear cause of its own on Scotland\u2019s future in the UK.  \u201cUp against the binary situation where we have unionism versus nationalism, that\u2019s a really difficult question for the Labour party,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is we are not comfortable nationalists and we are not comfortable unionists.\u201d Alex Rowley, the Scottish Labour deputy leader, openly called for the party to reexamine the case for home rule the day after the election; it is an idea broadly accepted by the UK Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, and one backed by senior trade unionists in Scotland. Home rule is already Liberal Democrat policy, but Davidson has promised to strengthen the Tories\u2019 unionist credentials by starting a party summer campaign to defend the union. In further developments, several Labour MSPs are emerging as frontrunners to become Holyrood\u2019s presiding officer, the equivalent to the role of Speaker in the Commons. Despite establishing the devolved parliament, Labour has not yet had a presiding officer. The former leadership contender Ken Macintosh is expected to confirm his candidacy, with the former Scottish leader Johann Lamont also named as a likely contender. The Scottish Tories are likely to offer John Scott, a recent deputy presiding officer and close ally of Davidson, as their lead candidate.",
