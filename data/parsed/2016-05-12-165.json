  "body": "Elgar\u2019s mature chamber music \u2013 the String Quartet and Violin Sonata, and especially the Piano Quintet \u2013 seems finally to be getting the more regular performances it deserves. But Donald Fraser\u2019s attention to the quintet has gone farther still, turning the work into a fully fledged orchestral piece, a three-movement symphony, in effect. The model for Fraser\u2019s arrangement was apparently Elgar\u2019s own orchestration of Bach\u2019s C minor Fantasia and Fugue, but it invites comparisons, too, with Schoenberg\u2019s orchestration of Brahms\u2019s G minor Piano Quartet. Kenneth Woods\u2019s performance with the English Symphony Orchestra certainly shows that it is a plausible orchestral work. As scored by Fraser, certain passages, such as the second subject in the opening movement, immediately connect with the world of the symphonies and the symphonic poem Falstaff \u2013 even if describing it as the wartime symphony that Elgar never wrote would be going too far. But while Fraser\u2019s work on the quintet does genuinely seem to give the music another dimension, his arrangement for mixed choir and strings of the song cycle Sea Pictures seems much less successful, losing the expressive identity of the familiar version with solo mezzo, and its range of orchestral colours.",
