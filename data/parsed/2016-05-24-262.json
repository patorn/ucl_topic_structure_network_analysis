  "body": "You will notice that the subtitle has been lifted from John Mortimer, creator of Rumpole, teaser of judges. For the novelist and critic Adam Mars-Jones\u2019s father was Sir William Mars-Jones, a judge whose cases would regularly make the news in the 1970s and 80s (for instance, the notorious ABC official secrets trial, or that of the\u00a0murderer Donald Neilson). The younger Mars-Jones\u2019s recent novels, Pilcrow and Cedilla, are marvels that rival Karl Ove Knausgaard for observation and detail. Those of us old enough to remember the beginning of Adam\u2019s career would experience an ecstasy of cognitive dissonance whenever his father\u2019s name appeared in the papers or on TV, often attaching itself to a controversial or audacious verdict. There was more than cognitive dissonance at home, as Mars-Jones senior was not just homophobic but \u201ca homophobe\u2019s homophobe\u201d, and Mars-Jones junior, as he has never taken any pains to hide from his public at least, is gay. There are differing ways in which a memoir of one\u2019s father \u2013 particularly if\u00a0that father is also vain, pompous, utterly convinced of his rectitude and combative to a degree unusual even in the courtrooms of the land \u2013 might pan out. You might have expected, say, a certain asperity, or an air \u2013 no, a howling gale \u2013 of grievance. As it is, there are moments when these take the stage, but what Mars-Jones (A) mostly goes for when discussing Mars-Jones (W) is humour \u2013 and, when describing his father\u2019s last days, tenderness. In the first half of the book especially, it is the humour you really notice; I can\u2019t remember reading anything so funny. The jokes are often paragraph length, so too long to quote here, but suffice it to say that the story ending with the line \u201cthirty bob and a box of Black Magic ought to do the trick\u201d had me unable to breathe properly for about five minutes. And a child\u2019s sex education is always a\u00a0rich mine. On literal, not figurative, arseholes: \u201cI knew my digestive system ended at a certain point, and I was willing to accept as a technicality of physical life that I possessed an anus, or I would have exploded long ago. But I had no visual information on the subject.\u201d (Note the way the legal \u201ctechnicality\u201d sneaks in there.) The vain and prickly make ideal targets, and sometimes all you have to\u00a0do is quote the butt of the joke, but what makes you realise this is a special memoir is that the author himself is often the one being mocked. Young Adam is a sensitive soul, carefully lifting the needle to avoid the Beatles song \u201cWhy Don\u2019t We Do It in the Road\u201d on the White Album because of its rudeness. The prudery may be, to a degree, inherited, but the physical delicacy is not. The tension between father and son\u2019s attitudes is exploited to maximum effect. Adam is conscious that his father is no longer around to answer the case (hence the kid gloves of the title, which are also what a town\u2019s assize court traditionally gave a\u00a0visiting judge when there were no criminal cases to be heard), and you feel a scrupulous adherence to fact \u2013 although it is rather clever of the young M-J to have heard the Beatles\u2019 \u201cShe Loves You\u201d on a car radio in 1962, when it wasn\u2019t composed until 1963. It is the underlying honesty \u2013 to his own, and to others\u2019 selves \u2013 that makes this book not just funny, but wise as well. The comedy comes from perception and insight, and a meticulous attention to language and meaning. As\u00a0for the style: to read the flow of his sentences is how I imagine a cat feels when it is stroked. To call him one of the best writers in the country seems a\u00a0pointless equivocation, for, at the moment, I can\u2019t think of anyone better. \u2022 To order Kid Gloves for \u00a37.99 (RRP \u00a39.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
