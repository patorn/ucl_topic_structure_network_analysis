Speaking at a Conservative policy convention on Thursday, Harper thanked the party faithful. \u201cWhile the election last fall did not yield the results we hoped for, the fact remains that our party has achieved remarkable success over the past decade,\u201d he told delegates.  The federal election in October saw the Conservatives plunge from 159 to 99 seats, handing a stunning majority to Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals and propelling them from third-party status to government. Harper announced his resignation as party leader in a press release soon after. On Thursday, Harper described what he called a \u201cproud record\u201d of cutting taxes, ushering in a tough-on-crime agenda and retooling party funding. \u201cAnd it was thanks to you that we were able to stand up as a country and take principled positions in a dangerous world,\u201d he told delegates.  He urged the party to move forward, highlighting its unity as members prepare to elect a new leader next year. \u201cThe past is no place to linger,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThe best is yet to come.\u201d  His remarks were met with a standing ovation from the more than 2,000 people who had gathered in Vancouver for the Conservative convention. Delegates feted Harper\u2019s leadership with a video tribute, encouraging supporters to join in with the hashtag #ThankYouStephenHarper. Some used it to genuinely express their gratitude. But the strategy soon went off the rails, as many others chimed in from across Canada with their own views of Harper\u2019s legacy. \u201c#ThankYouStephenHarper for muzzling scientists, shuttering projects, suppressing data, and making us a laughing stock in the sci community,\u201d tweeted one. \u201cFor denying an inquiry for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in spite of glaring statistics,\u201d wrote another.        The hashtag trended for hours as Canadians considered the lasting effects of their former government. \u201c#Thankyoustephenharper for holding Canada back 10 years on climate change,\u201d tweeted one.  Another said:        Others pointed to what they saw as the enduring outcome of Harper\u2019s time in office.        \u201c#ThankYouStephenHarper for inspiring me for the first time in my life to volunteer for a political campaign, P.S. it wasn\u2019t yours,\u201d added another.

Are you kidding me?\u201d Discussion of Harper\u2019s legacy comes amid reports that the former prime minister intends to resign as a member of parliament by autumn. Sources say Harper is contemplating several offers from US companies as well corporate boards. The former prime minister is also reportedly considering launching a foreign policy institute dedicated to the issues he championed during his time in office, such as advocacy for Israel and Ukraine. In December, the former prime minister registered a corporation, listing himself and two former staffers as directors of Harper & Associates Consulting Inc.",
