  "body": "A really excellent short story is a thing that refuses to be faced head on. It folds into itself, circles you back to its beginning and replays endlessly, while some part \u2013 the maddening, mesmerising part \u2013 remains impenetrable. The American writer David Means, whose four collections span 25 years, is the master of this kind of refusal. His stories, which evoke lives rather than the neat, lone epiphany that\u2019s become the form\u2019s standard, usually operate around an inner concealment, some careful reticence that reveals and compels grace. \u201cWhat you hope for,\u201d he offers, speaking in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, \u201cis that you radiate the past behind the story and the future in front of it. You want to end in a way that makes the reader go back and reread and pushes them forward into eternity or whatever the hell\u2019s out there. With a novel you actually have the opposite \u2013 you\u2019ve gotta wrap things up.\u201d Now, at 54, Means is a debut novelist with Hystopia, a mind-bending novel within a novel, that both does and does not wrap things up. A better word, in fact, than \u201cwrap\u201d might be \u201cenfold\u201d. Within the alternative history of the book \u2013 in which JFK, having survived multiple assassination attempts is serving his third term as president \u2013 the word is used to describe the process of repressing traumatic memory via a government-issued drug named Tripizoid. The government has tasked an agency called Psych Corps to deal with traumatised soldiers returning from Vietnam. It does so disastrously: bureaucracy and containment thwarting what these men require to become human again. Once enfolded, the only way to reverse the procedure is by immersion in very cold water or, more appealingly, \u201cfantastic, beautiful, orgasmic sex\u201d. The opposite, in other words, of systemising, state control. Among the unhinged veterans marauding the state of Michigan, enacting and re-enacting atrocities on civilians, is the psychotic Rake, who has drugged and kidnapped a young woman called Meg. A federal agent called Singleton is sent to find him and as he and another agent, Wendy, fall in love, they wonder if they are being manipulated by the agency into a forbidden relationship. This is a world created by Eugene Allen, a young soldier who has returned from Vietnam to write a novel called Hystopia, in which national and personal trauma fuse and spark. Much as they do for Means, who says he has wanted to write a Vietnam novel for 25 years, though the family trauma that inspired the book goes back even further. \u201cI used to be sort of reclusive,\u201d he says, \u201cbut when my dad died I was like, \u2018Fuck this, you have a lot of ideas, just start talking \u2013 it may not be coherent but maybe one out of every 10 sentences will be interesting.\u2019\u201d He talks about the intolerableness of those who speak in long, slow, perfectly formed pronouncements, and suggests that \u201cthe best speakers about ideas are comedians, because they can just make it all into a joke.\u201d In fact, Means has something of the stand up comic about him, with a demeanour of conspiratorial merriment. Which is not a phrase anyone has ever used about his work. He cares, as he puts it, about, \u201cpeople on the very edge of the human predicament\u201d: the homeless, suicidal, destitute and desperate. The quality of this caring, however, elevates his stories from the bleak into something sacred. As Jeffrey Eugenides described it, Means sees his characters, \u201cand life itself, from somewhere just beyond, in a position of maximum understanding and honourable detachment: a semidivine vantage point...\u201d   Related: Hystopia by David Means review \u2013 the virtuoso short story writer\u2019s tricksy first novel    Jonathan Franzen, who Means calls his \u201cclosest writer friend\u201d, recently described him as, \u201cremarkably kind, funny, well adjusted\u201d. Means, who in his own words is, \u201csomewhat religious in a hugely problematic way\u201d, believes in grace, both \u201cat the theological level but also at the sort of mechanical level too. If you\u2019re aware and you\u2019re human and you\u2019re alive and your attention is there, there is some moment after [atrocity] of grace.\u201d He once claimed that \u201call fiction is about the relation of the small moments in time to large ones\u201d and that relation is so often enacted in his work by omission. Sometimes the refusal to tell the story straight is literal, as in \u201cThe Blade\u201d, in which one vagrant in a huddle of men around a campfire withholds his \u201cknife story\u201d. With Hystopia, the withholding was a necessity of craft, as well as of familial respect. \u201cI had to work around it,\u201d he says, of his family story. \u201cAnd I had to use it as fuel, and I felt \u2013 and feel \u2013 that if I just came out with [it] that I\u2019d use it all up.\u201d In 2006, Means published \u201cThe Spot\u201d, a short story that features characters who appear in Hystopia: the captive Meg Allen and the soldier Billy-T. It would seem then, that the book unravelled itself from this story. In truth, there\u2019s a very Meansian chronological warping to the book\u2019s genesis. \u201cI took a year off to write a novel, and I chewed nicotine gum and I drank coffee and I wrote a manuscript, and I was almost done with the draft of the novel and then I said, \u2018Fuck this, I\u2019m going to write a story,\u2019 so I wrote \u2018The Spot\u2019.\u201d    With Vietnam it didn\u2019t take that long to not only ignore the war but act like we had actually won the war    Only years later did he return to that manuscript, which eventually became Hystopia. \u201cYou can\u2019t take a story and just stretch it out \u2013 that does not a novel make,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd I had done that! \u2013 I have written a couple of novels that I just couldn\u2019t put my name on. I always just thought it\u2019s better to look at the long run.\u201d Nonetheless: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be a story writer \u2013 no matter how much acclaim you get \u2013 and not write a novel.\u201d He pulls a note from Don DeLillo out of his backpack \u2013 proud and at the same time embarrassed by his pleasure and pride. They have been corresponding for years but have only met once, at David Foster Wallace\u2019s funeral in 2008. \u201cThe imperative is to keep doing stories,\u201d wrote DeLillo. \u201cIt takes a long time before the novel begins to reveal the deeper currents of the writer.\u2019\u201d Hystopia is prefaced with a quotation from Jonathan Shay, the doctor and writer whose work on PTSD Means deeply admires: \u201cTraumatic memory is not narrative.\u201d Trauma is not coherent, nor is war, hence, perhaps, our compulsion to tell ourselves stories about it. As Means sees it: \u201cWith Vietnam it didn\u2019t take that long to not only ignore the war but act like we had actually won the war. And now we lost the Iraq war, as far as I can tell, and we have people ...\u201d \u2013 he checks himself \u201c \u2013 I don\u2019t even want to say his name. I\u2019m trying to quickly guide us away from that.\u201d Five days after we meet, Trump wins the West Virginia and Nebraska primaries.   Related: Literary Mixtape: David Means's soundtrack for reflecting on the Vietnam War    \u201cHistory is delusional,\u201d Means says. \u201cNot just an illusion, it\u2019s a delusion. America is this giant country, so it has these big delusions, and history is where delusions play out. That\u2019s where our delusions of who we are take place \u2013 not in the present moment, not in the future, but in the past.\u201d In Vietnam, this happened on a micro level. As Means recounts with fervid incredulity, US generals would write the battle plan after the battle had happened, making reality a kind of retroactive fiction. In the novel, Singleton considers fictionalising his reports: \u201cHe\u2019d been hoping for a way into violence, for an apex of all narrative lines leading to Rake.\u201d \u201cAnything I write,\u201d Means stresses, \u201cis not even close to the absurdity and weirdness of Vietnam.\u201d He was careful to keep the book, for all its thematic and structural outlandishness, as straightforward as possible in its language. \u201cI really wanted to write the kind of book I wanted to read when I was 20. At some level I began to think, \u2018Wow I\u2019m writing a Young Adult novel for adults.\u2019 I had to realise that certain sentences are just going to move the novel along, and as a story writer you\u2019re not used to that, it seems cheap and too easy.\u201d Means was born in 1961 and grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where the primary industry was paper manufacturing. The Kalamazoo river, one of the most polluted in the world, snakes through several of his stories, including \u201cThe Spot\u201d and \u201cSleeping Bear Lament\u201d, in which the narrator watches, \u201cthe failing light falling dead on the hardened corrugation of sludge\u201d. Means was too young to serve in Vietnam \u2013 just two years old when TV news showed what would become one of the defining images of the war, the Buddhist monk Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c, seated at a Saigon intersection, burning himself to death. But Means was a teenager when his aunt, mother of five and principal of a high school, stopped her car on the way to work one morning, poured gasoline over her head and immolated herself. Her suicide features in his story \u201cAssorted Fire Events\u201d where again, trauma is enfolded, this time within the sentence\u2019s parentheses themselves: she was, he writes, a \u201cmember of a fine upstanding family with no deep-felt hardships (apparent from the outside).\u201d    We\u2019re a quick-fix country and we drive forward and we eat up what we have fast, in terms of natural resources and ideas    How does a person, or a family, or a nation, get over such things? The phrase \u201call cures are bogus\u201d is one of Hystopia\u2019s refrains, as in: \u201cthe cure was actually often effective, so that the claim of its bogus nature was itself partly bogus\u201d. \u201cWe believe in cures,\u201d says Means, \u201cwe\u2019re a quick-fix country and we drive forward and we eat up what we have extremely fast, in terms of natural resources and also ideas and intellectual property. We\u2019re kind of wilfully stupid a lot of the time, anti-intellectual.\u201d And then a lighter note strikes him: \u201c\u2018Bogus\u2019 is a great word that I feel hasn\u2019t been used enough lately. There are so many things from the 60s and 70s, like \u2018cosmic\u2019 and \u2018groovy\u2019, that are actually really useful and should probably be back in the mix. I mean, it\u2019s sad that we don\u2019t think in that way any more, or at that level \u2013 that we shut that all down. But I believe that it can be brought back round again. That dynamic dreaming that the 60s had. The good side of the 60s \u2013 we can find it again.\u201d Only a work as intelligently engaged with trauma as Hystopia is could allow a reader to glimpse that kind of optimism. Eugene Allen\u2019s novel ends with a section entitled \u201cRumors\u201d, in which he offers various versions of his characters\u2019 fates. Before these though, they are granted a hippie ending, more utopia than hystopia, in which the couples go back to the land to seek salvation in love and nature. \u201cLike all good delusions,\u201d Means writes as Eugene, \u201cit was fuelled by genuine hope and dedication to the truth.\u201d \u2022 To order Hystopia by David Means for \u00a312.99 (RRP \u00a316.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
