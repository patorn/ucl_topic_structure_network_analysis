You\u2019ll be able to buy a copy of Potter\u2019s newly discovered and much-hyped late book, The Tale of Kitty-in-Boots, or put your children in fancy dress as Mrs Tiggy-Winkle or Samuel Whiskers. And that\u2019s not forgetting the new 50p Peter Rabbit coin, which is already in circulation and selling on eBay for 40 times its face value. Coloured versions of the coin, originally costing \u00a355, are now changing hands for over \u00a3600.   Related: Unseen Beatrix Potter illustration to go on display for first time at V&A    But before we rush to condemn all this \u201cmerch\u201d as nothing but a tasteless desecration of childhood innocence, we need to remember that this is what Potter\u2019s world has always been about, from that moment in 1902 when she published her first animal tale. It\u2019s not simply that Potter was herself an eager marketeer, keen to sell the rights to her images for nursery wallpaper and christening beakers, so that when she died in 1943 she was a wealthy woman (and a public-spirited one too \u2013 she bought 4,000 acres of the Lake District and then gifted them to the National Trust). It\u2019s that the world Potter created so compellingly in those 23 little books comprises nothing less than a clear-sighted primer for navigating the amoral\u00a0world of mature capitalism. Writing at a time when the human cost and economic vulnerability that underlay Britain\u2019s imperial project could no longer be ignored, Potter shows us a world where there is one cardinal rule: eat or be eaten. On the very first page of her very first book, Peter Rabbit is sent out to play with the terrible maternal warning to be careful, because \u201cyour father had an accident; he was put in a pie by Mrs McGregor\u201d. Tom Kitten, meanwhile, is turned into a sausage roll, wrapped up in pastry by two triumphant-looking rats who are anticipating a particularly splendid dinner. Nor, in Potter\u2019s world, is there any point in looking to adult lawgivers to put things right and kiss things better. Jemima Puddle-Duck, an experienced mother, is obliged to stand by helplessly while her eggs are stolen by Mr Tod, \u201ca foxy person\u201d.     Beatrix Potter in 1913 at Hill Top Farm. \u2018When she died in 1943 she was a wealthy woman (and a public-spirited one too \u2013 she bought 4,000 acres of the Lake District and then gifted them to the National Trust) Photograph: AP    Private property is constantly under threat in Potter\u2019s world \u2013 at risk of being taken over by someone who is bigger and stronger. The Two Bad Mice break into a doll\u2019s house and, when they find that they can\u2019t eat the pasteboard food, take malicious pleasure in trashing the place. Mr Tod, meanwhile, is a profligate capitalistic landlord who has \u201chalf a dozen houses\u201d but is \u201cseldom at home\u201d, and as a result is constantly watching out for opportunistic squatters. Potter was writing as Darwin\u2019s earlier revelations about nature being a place of ceaseless, violent competition were being grafted on to the realisation that the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d applied as much to two-legged creatures as it did to those with tails and whiskers. Beneath our thin veneer of civilisation we are, Potter warns, nothing but beasts, red in tooth and claw. In The Tale of Tom Kitten, Tom and his sisters are told by their mother to \u201cwalk on their hind legs\u201d while wearing their best clothes like respectable, rational beings. Within minutes, though, they are scrapping in the dust, naked, while some thieving ducks make off with their clothes. Civilisation turns out to be an illusion, as much a matter of top-dressing as Diggery Delvet\u2019s velvet coat.   Related: Leave Peter Rabbit alone!    Unlike virtually any other classic children\u2019s author you care to mention, Potter didn\u2019t offer much in the way of happy endings. Although her heroes and heroines just about manage to escape with their lives, they mostly finish the story having lost something of value. (Squirrel Nutkin, indeed, is obliged to leave his tail behind on Owl Island.) Nor is there any sense of a moral lesson having been learned. Instead Tom Kitten, Jemima Puddle-Duck and their furry, feathered friends will, we are led to believe, repeat their adventures tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that. And at some point, they will almost certainly get killed and eaten. So when, this summer, you find yourself tutting over the way that your childhood memories of mice in pinnies and ducks in bonnets have been desecrated by the dead hand of commercial exploitation, remember this. The reason why we still care so passionately about Beatrix Potter is not because she offers us an escape from the random cruelties that are part of decaying capitalism, but because she has the moral toughness to show us exactly what it feels like to be powerless and afraid.",
