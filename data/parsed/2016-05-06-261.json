Nearly 16 years ago, my daughter\u2019s father and I, who had never married, separated. Although her primary residence was with me, she adored going to her father\u2019s cavernous studio apartment. At my house, there were rules and regular bath times. At Daddy\u2019s house, it was messier, looser, louder. Daddy let her throw water balloons out the window. Daddy never made her clean up her toys. Daddy was fun! Daddy was also sick. Although I didn\u2019t realize it when my daughter was born, her father was \u2013 and is still, of course \u2013 bipolar. He was hospitalized for the first time when she was three. I went to see him; we\u2019d already split up but remained committed co-parents, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 friends. At the end of that first visit, I watched him walk away from me down the hallway, head hanging, shuffling slowly along like an old man.   Related: MRIs terrify me. My cancer history means I must endure two a year, forever | Mary Elizabeth Williams    My heart tightened with pain. When it released, it was full of fear. My flower-faced daughter \u2013 who built houses for the worms in the garden, who sang Sun, Sun, Mr Golden Sun while she painted, who trilled, \u201cMommy, isn\u2019t it a glo-ri-ous day?\u201d \u2013 came from this man. Could his illness be lurking in her DNA? Was it lying dormant in her developing brain, nestled silently somewhere, waiting, invisible? I felt my hands shaking as I walked to my car. The fear only increased as, in the next few years, the episodes that led to his hospitalizations became more disturbing. There were maggots in the Christmas stockings. Dirty pots littered the kitchen floor, stinking and slick with mold. The floor of his living room resembled an archeological site; if you dug deep enough, you\u2019d likely uncover the remains of a pizza and Christmas wrappings from four months ago.  During one particularly bad week, he became psychotic because of a medication problem. He thought his watch was a camera and began seeing people who weren\u2019t there. He stayed up all night painting gold flames on his floor. He nailed cowboy boots to the ceiling, bought things he couldn\u2019t afford. The hospitalizations multiplied, largely as a result of a woefully insufficient and overtaxed mental health system that cycled people in and out of the few beds it had available without holding itself accountable for what happened next. There was no follow-through, no medication management, no consistency of treatment. In, out and back. Repeat. I didn\u2019t know how to navigate any of this \u2013 not the system itself, nor the complex and unwritten rules of how to co-parent with someone who was sometimes well enough to take care of a child and sometimes wasn\u2019t \u2013 but was always well intentioned, even when he couldn\u2019t accurately self-report. I never seemed to be able to predict the next breakdown, or see the warning signs clearly enough to act pre-emptively. One afternoon, in particular, stands out. I was sitting at my desk in the newsroom when my phone rang. It was my ex, and his voice was slurred almost to the point of incoherence. \u201cI can\u2019t find her,\u201d he mumbled. It was late afternoon. He was supposed to be watching our daughter at my house, after getting her off the bus. I felt panic and started to shake. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you meet the bus? \u201cI don\u2019t know where she is,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI must have fallen asleep.\u201d In the seconds it took me to absorb what he was saying and plan my next move \u2013 call the school, the bus company, the police \u2013 I imagined her in the back of some stranger\u2019s car, or locked in a room in one of the city\u2019s myriad brick apartment buildings, terrified and about to raped or murdered. By the time I found her \u2013 eating cookies in the principal\u2019s office and wondering why no one had met her bus \u2013 I was berating myself. I should have seen this coming. I should have known he had spiraled out of control again. I should have prevented it all from happening.    The chase began \u2013 the bat in the lead, me following, in some deranged circle of mutual fear    Fear of what the future would hold intensified. I took to watching my daughter sleep while I replayed her day in my head. Was her sensitivity a warning of the deep depressions that had engulfed her father \u2013 and also me \u2013 at times? Was her excessive enthusiasm at other times a signal of mania to come? Into this torpid mix of fear and illness crept the bat. One late summer night, as I was sitting on my couch after an especially long day at work, I heard the loud and insistent chirping of what I assumed was a cricket. I tried to ignore it, then realized it was in the house with me. In fact, it sounded like it was next to me. I turned my head slowly, like a person who knows what she will find, and there was the bat, lurching its way on to my shoulder. I screamed and jumped, which frightened the bat. It scuttled down the couch, on to the floor, and the chase began \u2013 the bat in the lead, me following, in some deranged circle of mutual fear. The bat was injured and it couldn\u2019t fly, but it was fast. Around and around the house we went \u2013 kitchen, dining room, living room, front hallway \u2013 until I realized the chase was futile.  I stopped. I thought about the night the mice had gotten into another home of mine, many years earlier. How I\u2019d lain in bed, frozen with panic, as I listened to them scampering around the cabinet under my kitchen sink. How I\u2019d steeled myself that night to confront the mice. How I\u2019d learned to catch them with a paper bag and a broom, and then release them into the woods near my house. I went for the bag and the broom and, after a few panicked, fumbling attempts (bats are creepier than mice), slid it into the bag. I let the bat go outside. It didn\u2019t happen overnight \u2013 and it certainly didn\u2019t happen in a rush of epiphany as I stared down that bat \u2013 but I eventually came to understand that my fear for my daughter, while understandable and atavistic, was a lot like that late-night chase around my house \u2013 it wasn\u2019t going to get me anywhere. Rather, replaying the same thoughts over and over again in my head in a loop was going to doom us, though not in the way I was imagining. I would rob her childhood of its joy, at the very least, and for what? It wouldn\u2019t solve anything, or prevent something bad from happening to her, or even help me cope with it if it did. As with the bat, the only way to deal with what scares us is to confront it directly. With that understanding came calm. My daughter\u2019s father, thankfully, is much better, largely as a result of his own remarkable determination. And our daughter, now 18 and a freshman in college, is a creative, maddening, amazing mix of her parents, her environment and herself. I don\u2019t know what her future will bring, but I find that I can contemplate that uncertainty with both excitement and a normal measure of anxiety.  After all, life offers us a seemingly endless number of opportunities, large and small, to have courage. She, like her parents, will eventually learn what a privilege it is to seize them.
