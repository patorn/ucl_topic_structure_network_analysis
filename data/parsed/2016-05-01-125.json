Lewis-Stempel has 70 acres spread over five lots, but this volume, the latest capitalising on the vogue for nature writing, tells the story of the acquisition of 15 new acres on a two-year farm business tenancy. The parcel included an arable field, and the author sets about, over the course of a year, sowing wheat and wildflowers. Where possible, he follows traditional ways, often deploying non-traditional methods to achieve his goals: he buys an antique seed fiddle on eBay for \u00a3150 and cuts his wheat into sheaves rather than bales.    I had no idea that the ploughman\u2019s lunch was invented by the Cheese Bureau in the 50s    The diary form of The Running Hare facilitates impressionistic and spontaneous prose as the rural year unfurls. Problems queue up for recognition, of course, but Lewis-Stempel ploughs on (sorry), sowing, among other things, to encourage the eponymous hare. And the animal comes. \u201cHave hares, have our national landscape.\u201d Readers who enjoyed the author\u2019s last book, Meadowland: The Private Life of an English Field, will find much in the same vein here: a mix of agricultural history, rural lore, topographical description and childhood memories. I learned a good deal. I had no idea that traditionally in the countryside sexual abstinence prevailed from Advent till Candlemas (2 February) in order to avoid heavy pregnancies at harvest time. Or that the ploughman\u2019s lunch was invented by the Cheese Bureau in the 50s.   Related: Meadowland review \u2013 John Lewis-Stempel's fascinating field study    At his best, Lewis-Stempel is a fine stylist, adroitly conjuring scenes in which \u201cmedieval mist hangs in the trees\u201d or \u201cfrost clenches the ground\u201d. He uses the dramatic present, always tricky, and on the whole pulls it off. The conversational tone can be less successful: I don\u2019t care for \u201cI kid you not\u201d in a proper book, or \u201csorted\u201d. Cliches sprout like the ears of wheat: \u201cYou can take the boy off the farm, but you can\u2019t take the farm out of the boy.\u201d But Lewis-Stempel quotes widely and judiciously from folk songs and literature (Gerard Manley Hopkins, John Clare, Edward Thomas). His passion for the Herefordshire countryside sings from these pages. He says that a bond he formed with a crow in his field was \u201cone of the greatest privileges in my life\u201d. There is a political dimension. Identifying as an \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d, Lewis-Stempel asserts his moral superiority over his neighbours \u201cthe Chemical Brothers\u201d and states that \u201cevery time one buys the lie of cheap food a flower or a bird dies\u201d. But the cheap food he so despises is all that is affordable to many. Regrettably, a whiff of class privilege hovers over these pages. That said, there are no glib solutions here to the problems we have created, and this is not a campaigning book. Lewis-Stempel is a realist. He thinks George Monbiot\u2019s \u201crewilding\u201d mission is an idea that should \u201cget into the fucking sea with the red herrings\u201d; it is \u201cat best, fiddling at the edges of Britain\u2019s environmental problems\u201d. Agreed; but what else can we do? The National Farmers\u2019 Union is worse, it turns out, than St Monbiot. When it boasts of its members\u2019 efforts to support birds, Lewis-Stempel writes: \u201cThat clapping sound? The ghost of Goebbels putting his hands together in awed appreciation of some real propaganda.\u201d Crikey.   The Running Hare is published by Doubleday (\u00a316.99).
