Keith Hackett\u2019s verdict 1) You can\u2019t allow the captain to get away with this: caution him, or show him a red card if you feel his action involved excessive force. After checking on the wellbeing of the injured player, and telling the physio in no uncertain terms to calm down, have a word with their captain too, making it clear that any time-wasting tactics will be dealt with firmly. As always, include full details in your post-game report. Thanks to Bongai Jinguri. 2) If you let this go with just a warning you\u2019ll be making the situation even worse for yourself. You have to show him a yellow card for dissent, because he\u2019s clearly undermining your authority. You need to have the self-confidence to stand by, and to defend, difficult decisions. Thanks to Daniel Small. 3) You have the option to award a dropped ball in the corner \u2013 but really, with the ball obviously out of play, it is better to make a clear decision and stick to it. Again, it\u2019s important in terms of game management to be clear, confident and decisive. You can make a case for either decision: the attacking team, whose restart it is, would obviously favour a corner, but a throw would be the safest, least controversial option. On balance, I\u2019d award the throw. Thanks to David Robertson.Last week\u2019s answers: No372: Kasper Schmeichel How this week\u2019s FA Cup special came together...",
