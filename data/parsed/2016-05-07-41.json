  "body": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who prides himself on the consistency Arsenal show in finishing in the top four throughout his two decades at the club, believes the days of the same cabal of elite clubs earning Champions League qualification are numbered. \u201cThis might be questioned in the future,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThe big question mark is what happened with Leicester could happen again with a different team.\u201d Such is the new opportunity symbolised by Leicester City\u2019s remarkable title win, and the enhanced financial power that has strengthened the transfer market position for those outside the traditional Premier League powerbase, Wenger found it difficult to imagine how many teams could be in contention next season. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the start of this season,\u201d he said. \u201cPredictions were: number one Chelsea will win it again. Number two, Man City. In the end any pundit who would have predicted Leicester would have met the response: \u2018Stop your job and do something else\u2019. And that is what can happen again.   Related: How West Ham struck the deal of the century with Olympic Stadium move    \u201cMaybe a team that nobody expects now will come next season and surprise everyone. All the English clubs have the money to buy now. You\u2019ve got West Ham moving into a new stadium with more potential with the finances that brings. Tottenham are creating a new stadium as well. So in a few years the potential in England will be much more shared than everywhere else and you can get more surprises. Let\u2019s not forget Leicester are not poor. If you go to the car park of Leicester, you will still see some nice cars. But they\u2019ve done extremely well with less resources and their efficiency level between money spent and results are by far the best in Europe, and you have to give them credit for that.\u201d Wenger has been struck by how there has been a kind of equalising effect in the Premier League this season. \u201cFirst of all every English team can buy players,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the difference in the market between those who are just a fraction better and the players who will go to lower clubs can be made up with a bit more spirit and a bit more fighting, a bit more support and a bit less expectation.\u201d While full of respect for Leicester\u2019s unprecedented achievement, Wenger admitted it has stung to see the way the title race ended up. \u201cIt hurts. If somebody is better than you, you have to accept it and Leicester were better than everybody else. Do you think Man City, Tottenham or Man United have no regret? That\u2019s competition.\u201d Wenger takes his Arsenal team to Manchester City knowing a win would tie up third place. After an unforgiving second half to the season, he is urging his team to finish strongly. \u201cWe have to be more ruthless,\u201d he said.",
