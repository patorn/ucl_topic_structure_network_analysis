  "body": "I love this book because it\u2019s a funny interactive story. What is different about this book is that it\u2019s like an activity book. You are allowed to doodle in the book, rip a page, fold a page to go into warp speed and most importantly choose your own path through the story. There is lots in this book that makes me laugh, such as the page with the control panel where you have to choose between Crash, Explode and Land. If you choose explode there\u2019s a note at the bottom asking, Are you crazy?. This book is very entertaining. It kept me intrigued because I didn\u2019t know what I would have to do next. Once I started I didn\u2019t want to stop because I really wanted to know what new things I would get to draw and what choices I would have to make. I think the book\u2019s secret weapon is its funniness.          I would recommend this book to doodle-loving fun-loving children everywhere (even adults might enjoy this one).
