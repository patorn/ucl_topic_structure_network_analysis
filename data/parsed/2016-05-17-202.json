  "body": "Author and illustrator PJ Lynch has been announced the fourth Laureate na n\u00d3g, Ireland\u2019s laureate for children\u2019s literature. He is passed the baton by outgoing Laureate na n\u00d3g Eoin Colfer.   Related: The Boy Who Fell Off the Mayflower \u2013 in pictures    So let\u2019s find out a bit about PJ Lynch. He was born in Belfast and has illustrated over 20 beautiful books. PJ is two times winner of the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal, first for The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey (Walker Books) written by Susan Wojciechowski and again for When Jessie Came Across the Sea written by Amy Hest. He\u2019s also been awarded the Christopher medal (which is massive in the US) three times. PJ is a big lover of folklore and traditional stories so legends and fairy tales have been a recurring subject of his work.  Check out this gorgeous gallery he made for us about his book The Boy Who Fell off the Mayflower (Walker Books) for a real flavour of his gorgeous illustrations and writing.     An illustration from The Boy Who Fell off The Mayflower by PJ Lynch: settlers are hampered by bitter winter storms. Illustration: PJ Lynch, Walker Books    As he was crowned Laureate na n\u00d3g today PJ Lynch told us about his laureate plans: \u201cBeing named the new Laureate is one of the proudest moments of my career. I want to explore the magic that happens when words and pictures come together. My theme as Laureate na n\u00d3g will be \u201cThe Big Picture\u201d \u2013 I plan to do a regular podcast involving live drawing or demonstrating techniques and I\u2019ll invite guests to talk about their drawing passions. I would also love to create a landmark image in a prominent place or places in Ireland as a permanent reminder of the power of pictures to incite the imagination.\u201d    Related: How to draw\u2026 with charcoal    We\u2019re really excited about what PJ is going to do as Laureate na n\u00d3g, and if this drawing lesson he made for us  is anything to go by, it\u2019s going to be a very fabulous laureateship indeed. Perhaps PJ will get together with the UK children\u2019s laureate Chris Riddell in a drawing project or two! Sheila Pratschke, chair of the Irish Arts Council which awards the laureateship, revealed a bit more about the achievements of the three Laureate na n\u00d3gs who have gone before PJ: \u201cFrom Siobh\u00e1n Parkinson\u2019s Laureate International Library to Niamh Sharkey\u2019s Picti\u00far to Eoin Colfer\u2019s Once upon a Place \u2013 each Laureate has left a meaningful creative legacy and inspired a new generation of readers, writers and illustrators. We are so honoured that the esteemed author and illustrator PJ Lynch is our fourth Laureate na n\u00d3g. An extraordinarily gifted and revered picturebook maker, PJ Lynch has already touched the lives of so many young people and their families. We are excited to bring his work and his passion to even more people through this initiative.\u201d    Related: Celebrating the work of Irish children's laureate Niamh Sharkey \u2013 in pictures    So watch this space, we\u2019ll be bringing you more from PJ Lynch over the next year (and beyond). PJ\u2019s next book book Patrick and the President, his collaboration with Ryan Tubridy about John F Kennedy\u2019s visit to Ireland, will be published in 2017.",
