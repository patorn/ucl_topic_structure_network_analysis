  "body": "\u2022 An interview with Marvin Rees, the newly elected mayor of Bristol, said he was the UK\u2019s first black mayor. We should have described him as the UK\u2019s first directly elected black mayor. Allan Glaisyer Minns, who was mayor of the Norfolk town of Thetford from 1904 to 1906, is believed to be the UK\u2019s first black mayor (Once upon a time in the west, 23 May, page 6, G2). \u2022 An analysis piece (Why Gove\u2019s \u20185m\u00a0migrants\u2019 claim is absurd, 23 May, page\u00a07) said that in the event of Turkey joining the EU, \u201cBritain\u2019s membership of the Schengen area\u201d would create a barrier to the movement of Turkish workers to the UK. The writer intended to say that Britain\u2019s non-membership of the Schengen area would do so. \u2022 The name of Werner Faymann, who resigned as chancellor of Austria earlier this month, was misspelled several times as Feymann in an editorial (One leader\u2019s fall in Vienna, and the woes of a whole continent, 11 May, page 30). \u2022 Because of an editing error, we omitted the final letter from the surname of Rabbi Harry Jacobi, a co-signatory of a letter in Friday\u2019s paper (Give refugee children an education here, 20 May, page 32). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Women-only gyms are a world away from boys\u2019 clubs such as Muirfield",
