  "body": "On Saturday evening, I find my wife and Constance sitting in the garden. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Constance says, \u201cmy skin\u2019s fucked.\u201d \u201cStop swearing,\u201d my wife says. It is a lovely night, the warmest of the year so far. \u201cHey, handsome,\u201d Constance says. \u201cThanks for ruining my life.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I say. \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cYou wrote how much wine I drank the other week and made me sound like an alcoholic.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m usually pretty accurate about amounts,\u201d I reply. \u201cYou can\u2019t write about anything I\u2019ve been saying to your wife,\u201d Constance says. \u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d my wife says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t here.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d I say. \u201cCarry on.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare,\u201d Constance says. \u201cWill you stop swearing!\u201d my wife shouts. I used to avoid mentioning Constance in this column because I thought she liked it too much. On Saturday mornings, I would get texts from her that said, \u201cI love fame.\u201d Lately, though, she seems less charmed. Now, hours after she\u2019s been round, I get texts that say, \u201cKeep my secrets.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what I consider an appropriate response to being mentioned: mild alarm, perhaps. Only the previous evening, someone was asking me about the rules of engagement at a dinner party and I gave my stock answer: I avoid writing about my neighbours, because they didn\u2019t ask to live near me. But the truth is, I have no rules.      I tell Constance about a recent encounter. A few days earlier, I was sent to the corner shop to buy wine. There was another man buying wine at the till. He looked up as I approached, and smiled. \u201cI know you,\u201d he said. \u201cI read you.\u201d This could have meant a number of things. The man could have been saying, \u201cI can tell where you\u2019re coming from\u201d or, \u201cBy some power unknown to you, I am privy to your innermost thoughts.\u201d It seemed plausible, if a little arrogant, to assume that he just meant he read my column, but I wasn\u2019t going to commit myself to that interpretation. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou watch me,\u201d he said. It was not clear what he meant by this. Was he implying that I\u2019d gained a local reputation as a spy, a publisher of secrets? \u201cRight,\u201d I said. I searched his face, which was definitely familiar. I was sure we\u2019d met before, but I couldn\u2019t remember when. He introduced himself, a friendly reminder of his name, which was also familiar. We shook hands. I still couldn\u2019t place him. We chatted about the many different wines available in the corner shop, a subject on which I normally have a lot to say, but I became tongue-tied and wary, unable to understand the footing on which the conversation was taking place. Were we former colleagues? Did we have a mutual friend with whom one of us may have fallen out? The encounter spluttered to an awkward conclusion, and I left. I was halfway home when I realised that we\u2019d never met, and that the man had seemed familiar because he was the actor who plays Sharon Horgan\u2019s feckless brother in Catastrophe. \u201cI tried to apologise to him on Twitter later,\u201d I say, \u201cbut he\u2019s not on Twitter.\u201d \u201cWhat is this story about?\u201d Constance says. \u201cIt\u2019s about him being recognised in a shop by an actual famous person,\u201d my wife says. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cThe problem is, I didn\u2019t find out if he lives round here.\u201d \u201cLook how pleased he is,\u201d my wife says to Constance. \u201cDoes he count as a neighbour or not?\u201d I ask. The next morning, I\u2019m in B&Q when I receive a text from Constance. It says, \u201cIf you put anything about me in your article, I will sue you. OK love you.\u201d",
