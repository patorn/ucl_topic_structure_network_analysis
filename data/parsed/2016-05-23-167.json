When I came out as gay to my straight housemates they were fiercely supportive; there were no negative reactions, no patronising comments or questionable jokes made in the name of \u201cbanter\u201d. I didn\u2019t have to hide any aspect of my personality, nor any of the guys I brought home. I never experienced homophobic abuse of any kind during my time there. And so I consider myself lucky \u2013 but not everyone can say the same.   Related: No straight people allowed:\u00a0students share views on LGBT-only halls    Verbal and physical hate crimes are still a common reality for a significant number of young LGBT people, many of whom see university as a chance to escape their tormentors and mix with like-minded people. Housemate compatibility is a lottery, though, and moving into student halls to live with total strangers is a daunting process, even for the most tenacious undergrad. But while most will fret over the potential differences in interests, cleanliness or bad habits, LGBT people have the additional concerns: will my new housemates fundamentally disagree with my right to exist, for instance. Students at the University of York and University of Central Lancashire want to introduce LGBT-only housing. Placing vulnerable students with shared experiences together seems like a pragmatic, sensible move, after all. But critics \u2013 both gay and straight \u2013 have labelled the measures unnecessary, backwards, a barrier to integration and, somewhat inevitably, as leading to heterosexual discrimination. Stonewall\u2019s own tepid comments on the issue suggest even they remain unconvinced; universities should instead focus on building an inclusive and accepting culture.    Many young LGBT people see university as a chance to escape their tormentors and mix with like-minded people    Except our culture is neither of those things, and abstract statements from equality charities will do little to change that. Abuse and discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity is a reality for many LGBT people, crimes which are rising in frequency, crimes which often go unreported. And it\u2019s people who are the most visibly queer and don\u2019t pass as straight who are most at risk, especially those living outside liberal metropolitan bubbles or the more progressive universities campuses. Feeling safe in your own home is a pretty basic expectation, and LGBT-exclusive housing gives these students a space where they can be themselves, totally free from judgment and bigotry. They don\u2019t need to panic about unprovoked, aggressive reactions if they come out to flatmates, or check themselves for fear of being a bit too queer (there\u2019s no such thing). It\u2019s especially important for the trans community, which contends with the some of the highest levels of violence and discrimination.   Related: LGBT students on lad culture: 'Will I be safe on campus today?'    Sana Iqbal, student council chair at the University of Central Lancashire, suggested it would be better to raise awareness of LGBT issues to protect vulnerable students, rather than provide their own housing. Why not do both? Providing vulnerable students with separate accommodation doesn\u2019t negate the need for universities to educate their students about different identities. Nor would it coincide with the creation of an impenetrable divide between the queer and straight student communities. Integration doesn\u2019t stop with student accommodation; housing LGBT students together won\u2019t prohibit them from mixing with the wider community. It isn\u2019t a case of segregation \u2013 it\u2019s about choice. There are plenty of LGBT students who would probably reject the opportunity to stay in separate accommodation, as is their right. But no one stands to gain from forcing vulnerable students into a situation that makes them uncomfortable. University can be the perfect space for LGBT people to discover themselves; it was for me, and the support I received from my housemates was an invaluable part of that. But some people arrive at university already bearing the scars that come with years of homophobic, biphobic or transphobic torment. The opportunity to guarantee their own safety and live with like-minded people should be afforded from them. It won\u2019t protect them from prejudice in wider society, but it will offer them a reprieve. No one should consider themselves \u201clucky\u201d or grateful simply because their university experience was free from abuse.",
