  "body": "If Christian Fuchs was running the risk of taking things a little too far when he gatecrashed the press conference after Leicester City\u2019s 3-1 defeat of Everton and tipped a bottle of champagne over Claudio Ranieri\u2019s head, the Austrian\u2019s next act was much more in tune with his manager\u2019s thinking, providing a straightforward response to the question of whether this remarkable team can stay together. \u201cListen, we\u2019re playing Champions League football next season,\u201d Fuchs said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a good enough reason to stay at this club? I think all the lads know what this team is all about. So why not stay?\u201d   Related: Leicester City\u2019s triumph: the inside story of an extraordinary season | Stuart James    It is a question that applies to some of the staff as well as the players, and at the other end of the corridor at the King Power Stadium the man recently described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \u201cthe most influential person in the Premier League\u201d was giving the newly crowned English champions the best possible answer in that respect. Steve Walsh, Leicester\u2019s joint assistant manager and the head of recruitment, confirmed that he would be staying at the club along with Craig Shakespeare, another of Ranieri\u2019s three No2s, for the foreseeable future. \u201cWe\u2019ve not signed [the new contract] but it\u2019s all agreed,\u201d Walsh said, holding a glass of bubbly in his hand. Walsh, with that knack of unearthing rough diamonds, has his fingerprints all over this Leicester team and there was a broad grin on his face when he was asked whether N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who has been such a revelation this season, is the pick of the lot. \u201cI keep telling the same joke over and over again,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cNo matter who we\u2019re playing we play three in midfield, we play [Danny] Drinkwater in the middle as a holding player and we play Kant\u00e9 either side.\u201d While it remains to be seen whether Leicester can keep the indefatigable Kant\u00e9, Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy at the club now that the Champions League anthem has been added to the playlist at the King Power Stadium, a clear message has already been transmitted from the dressing room to Walsh about the type of players he seeks to bring in over the summer. \u201cThe players have said to me: \u2018We don\u2019t want any Bertie Big,\u2019\u201d Walsh said, leaving out the expletive. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to bring in people who fit in.\u201d Targets were being drawn up a long time ago with a view to adding quality as well as depth to a squad that, as Ranieri acknowledged, will have a far greater workload compared with this season because of their involvement in Europe. \u201cI hope we can find good players and make some replacements because next season there will be three cups and the Premier League and it will be important to be able to make good changes and give some rest to the players,\u201d Leicester\u2019s manager said. The draw for the Champions League group stage takes place on 25 August \u2013 almost eight years to the day since Leicester beat Tranmere Rovers 3-1 at home in League One \u2013 and Ranieri can already sense the mood in Monaco when his club\u2019s name appears on that little slip of paper plucked from among the first seeds. \u201cI believe when they make the draw for the Champions League a lot of teams will want to play against us because we are in [this competition] for the first time and they think we are underdogs,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cWe are underdogs but we are dangerous.\u201d For all that football never stands still, in some ways to focus on the future seems a little unfair in the immediate aftermath of an occasion as uplifting and emotional as Saturday. So many images are seared into the mind, from the sight of Ranieri proudly standing alongside Andrea Bocelli as the Italian tenor produced such a spine-tingling performance, to that wonderful and surreal moment later in the evening when Wes Morgan and his 64-year-old manager thrust the Premier League trophy into the night sky to a backdrop of fireworks and tears. They were extraordinary scenes to try to take in and digest, for the players as well as the fans. \u201cWe won it on Monday night at Jamie\u2019s house. But to actually see it there, walk up and put the medal round your neck and see your skipper lift it, it hits you,\u201d Danny Simpson said. \u201cThe medal\u2019s not coming off for weeks.\u201d There is no time to rest and let everything soak in. The club\u2019s annual awards dinner is on Tuesday evening, Vardy is in London on Thursday night to collect his Football Writers\u2019 player of the year trophy, Ranieri returns to Stamford Bridge on Sunday in what promises to be another special occasion and the following day the open-top bus winds its way through the streets of Leicester for one more party. English football may never be the same again. \u201cI think we have proved that anything is possible,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cYou can go through the group individually. But it\u2019s a team game and that is what we have proved this season. We are a team. Every single one of us has a little story, for whatever reason at other clubs. We\u2019ve all come to Leicester, a great family club, and we have gelled as a group. Every one of us has excelled.\u201d Man of the match Andy King (Leicester City)",
