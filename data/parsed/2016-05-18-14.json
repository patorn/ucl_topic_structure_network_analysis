  "body": "An exclusive kiteboarding club on a tiny island \u2013 just a 15-minute helicopter ride away from Silicon Valley \u2013 has been threatened with a $4.6m fine by a California state water agency, which is accusing the club\u2019s owner of damaging tidal wetlands. Since purchasing the tiny island, the Point Buckler Club, in 2011, John Sweeney, a former professional sailor and advertising executive, has rebuilt levees, added two helipads, and built a lounge area featuring dark green shipping containers, AstroTurf, a wood-burning stove, and bright orange styling to achieve what he describes on Facebook as a \u201cSunset Magazine look circa 1960s\u201d. \u201cThe work I\u2019ve done is completely legal and within the law,\u201d Sweeney said on Wednesday, the day after the state agency fired the latest shot in a two-year legal battle over the fate of the land. Point Buckler Club consists of 51 acres of land situated between the open waters of Grizzly Bay and the brackish Suisun Marsh, about 50 miles east of San Francisco. The Suisun Marsh includes about 140 privately owned and managed wetlands \u2013 plots of land known as duck clubs, where owners use pumps to flood ponds and maintain the proper vegetation to attract ducks during the winter hunting season. Sweeney took it up a notch by turning his property into what he calls \u201cthe most exclusive kiteboard and duck club in the world\u201d. The club has just eight member/owners now, he said, but is looking to add two or three members this summer, at a price in the \u201csix figures\u201d.

Photograph: John Sweeney    That might sound steep for your average duck hunter, but kiteboarding \u2013 a high-velocity sport that involves riding a surfboard across the surface of the water while propelled by a kite sail \u2013 has become known as the \u201cnew golf\u201d for Silicon Valley elites.  \u201cIt\u2019s the number one sport for all Silicon Valley VCs and CEOs,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to do deals and enjoy a sport together.\u201d  Bill Tai, a venture capitalist and founder of MaiTai \u2013 which Sweeney describes as \u201cTedTalks for kiteboarders\u201d \u2013 has attributed kiteboarding\u2019s popularity among the tech set to Google founders Sergey Brin\u2019s and Larry Page\u2019s public adoption of the sport in the early 2000s.    Related: Richard Branson's kiteboard record attempt blown off course    Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Dropbox\u2019s Drew Houston are all reported to be part of MaiTai\u2019s invitation-only circuit, but Sweeney will not disclose the names of his club\u2019s members.  \u201cWe have non-disclosure agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a business; it\u2019s private.\u201d  How far Sweeney\u2019s rights as a private property owner extend are in dispute, however, thanks to the state agencies charged with protecting bodies of water and wildlife habitats.    There was no application for permits, and as such, the work that was done was highly destructive to the ecosystem  Dyan White     Dyan White, the head of the California regional water board\u2019s prosecuting team for the area, said that the $4.6m proposed fine would be the largest ever levied. (The agency calculated that Sweeney\u2019s total base liability was actually more than $11m but recommended reducing the penalty.) \u201cThere was no application for permits, and as such, the work that was done was highly destructive to the ecosystem,\u201d White said. \u201cAt the time [Sweeney] purchased the island, it was fully functioning as a tidal wetland. He built a levee around it, he cut off all tidal flow, and he dried the levee out.\u201d  Among the species damaged by these actions, White said, are salmon and delta smelt, which are protected.

Photograph: John Sweeney    White said that if Sweeney had applied for permits, the state would have cooperated with him to ensure that the work was done in an environmentally responsible manner. \u201cWe do this all the time,\u201d she said. But Sweeney claims that his property is covered by the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act, a 1977 state law that codifies the rights and responsibilities of private landowners in the wetlands.  That law \u201cprotects each duck club in perpetuity and gives each duck club a manual for how to fix its levees,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cAll we did was fix our levees.\u201d Sweeney successfully challenged a previous abatement order from the water board in December 2015, and in March he sued the water board, seeking an injunction to stop the agency from issuing any more abatement orders.  That case has a hearing scheduled for 28 July, while the proposed fine will go before the state\u2019s appointed water board on 10 August.  In the meantime, Sweeney appears confident that he will prevail over the state regulators.  \u201cThe water board can issue press releases all the time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re the ones suing them.\u201d",
