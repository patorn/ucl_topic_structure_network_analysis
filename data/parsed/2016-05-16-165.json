  "body": "Simon Mignolet has said Wednesday\u2019s Europa League final against Sevilla represents a chance to save Liverpool\u2019s debut season under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Liverpool must win in Basel to qualify for European competition next season after finishing eighth in the Premier League following Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw at West Bromwich Albion. Klopp\u2019s team would qualify for the group stage of the Champions League with victory over Sevilla, who are attempting to win the Europa League for a third consecutive season, and Mignolet admits the final will define Liverpool\u2019s season. The goalkeeper also revealed Kolo Tour\u00e9 predicted the campaign would end on a high after the shootout defeat by Manchester City in February\u2019s Capital One Cup final.   Related: J\u00fcrgen Klopp has Liverpool united behind him for Europa League final    \u201cWe know we can save our season by winning this trophy, especially as we would qualify for the Champions League,\u201d the Belgium international said. \u201cWe went to the final of the League Cup this season and lost in the cruellest way but now we have a great chance to win the Europa League and qualify for the Champions League, which would be a massive boost for the club, and for the young players in the squad. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had the experience of a shootout in a final this season but I don\u2019t want to think about this one going to penalties. But Kolo did say to me after the League Cup final that you have to go through these experiences before you win. He is the most experienced voice in the dressing room, so you listen to what he says and he usually sits next to me on the coach. The first thing he said to me on the coach after the League Cup final, when we were all so disappointed, was the experience would help us going forwards.\u201d Mignolet believes Liverpool\u2019s progress to the final via Manchester United, the tournament favourites, Borussia Dortmund, and Villarreal has demonstrated the calibre and the importance of the oft-maligned Europa League. He said: \u201cPeople don\u2019t always speak about the Europa League in the highest terms but, for me, and for most people on the continent, it is a major tournament. Any Belgian player who can play in the Europa League final is delighted about it. The teams we\u2019ve played against on the way to the final \u2013 Manchester United, which is always an important derby, Borussia Dortmund, because of the gaffer, and Villarreal, who are a very good side and fourth in La Liga \u2013 they are all worthy of playing in the Champions League. That has made the Europa League a bigger competition this year. Tottenham were in it, too. There are only two teams left now and hopefully we can get the better of a very good Sevilla side.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s last major European triumph was the Champions League victory over Milan in 2005, when Jerzy Dudek replicated Bruce Grobbelaar\u2019s \u2018spaghetti-legs\u2019 routine against Roma in 1984 in the shootout. The goalkeeping tradition may not continue in Basel should the final be decided the same way, Mignolet concedes. \u201cOne of our rituals as a family in Belgium was to get together to watch the Champions League final,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI remember the weather was really good in 2005, so we put the television in the garden and I watched it until late with my brother and my dad. At half-time you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen for Liverpool but then they turned it around. Dudek didn\u2019t only make great penalties in the shootout but he made a few before that. \u201cThe final could have been finished before penalties but for his double save from Shevchenko. Then he put the strikers off in the shootout and delivered for his team and his club. I\u2019ve seen what Grobbelaar did against Roma, too, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got the shaky legs! Let\u2019s leave it there! There is so much pressure on the penalty taker, so I suppose anything that puts him off will help.\u201d",
