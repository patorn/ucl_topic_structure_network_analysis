Both sides have intensified the rhetoric as they vie for control of a country wracked by food shortages, looting, power cuts, spiralling violence, a shrinking economy and the world\u2019s highest rate of inflation.           Blackouts, looting and murder: Venezuela\u2019s state of emergency     Maduro, who says the country\u2019s problems are the result of a plot by rightwingers and foreign interests to destabilise the country and end his rule, decreed a state of emergency on Friday. But parliament refused to pass it, with opposition leaders instead pushing for a referendum to recall Maduro for mismanagement. They have collected enough signatures to trigger a broader recall petition under the constitution, but the president dismissed the referendum as \u201coptional\u201d.  For now, Maduro has the upper hand, because the supreme court and election authorities are broadly supportive of his government, and can overrule parliament on the state of emergency and obstruct efforts to organise a recall vote.    Either they solve this problem, or we\u2019re going to have to take to the streets  Wilson Fajardo, mechanic      If Maduro can put off a referendum until next year, losing would have a more limited impact. An ousting this year would trigger an election, while next year it would simply allow his deputy to take power.     Maduro addresses reporters at the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas.

There is deep frustration about Venezuela\u2019s slide towards chaos even among people who voted for Maduro or supported his populist predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. People are forced to queue for hours for basic goods, and still their children go hungry. \u201cThis is unbearable,\u201d Wilson Fajardo, 56, a mechanic whose three children ate only bread for dinner the previous night, told Reuters this week. \u201cWe voted for Maduro because of a promise we made [to] Ch\u00e1vez, but that promise has expired. Either they solve this problem, or we\u2019re going to have to take to the streets.\u201d Public servants are on a two-day week, there are regular rolling blackouts and the murder rate has soared. The number of people killed in Venezuela in the first three month of this year has outstripped the civilian toll of Afghanistan\u2019s war in all of 2015, the New York Times noted in an editorial damning Maduro\u2019s rule. Previous protests about the recall vote turned violent, with demonstrators throwing stones and police using teargas on protesters and pepper spray on Capriles, and Caracas is bracing for another day of unrest.",
