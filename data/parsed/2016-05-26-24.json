  "body": "Dan Cole believes his club-mate and new England call-up Ellis Genge has \u201can edge\u201d to him, saying he has been impressed with the new Leicester signing\u2019s attitude and physicality. Leicester confirmed the \u200bpermanent \u200bsigning of the 21-year-old prop on Thursday, with Genge having previously been on loan at the Tigers from Bristol. The Leicester director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, described him as a great prospect and Eddie Jones \u200brecently \u200bnamed the forward in his England squad for the Test with Wales on Sunday and the summer tour of Australia.   Related: Ten newcomers named in 39-man Wallabies training squad for England series    Genge is one of four uncapped players in the squad and having been a team-mate of his in recent months, Cole believes \u200bGenge\u2019s\u200b ball-carrying skills \u200bare a major asset. \u201cHe\u2019s a young loosehead and he\u2019s impressed everybody,\u201d said the England tighthead prop. \u201cHis ball carrying is there to be seen. He has fitted in seamlessly at Leicester and has impressed everyone with his general attitude and demeanour. Obviously Eddie has picked up on it here and he\u2019s training well and doing a very good job. \u201cGengey has got a bit of an edge about him, he\u2019s quiet but when he needs to be physical he is. I think he enjoys the confrontation of the set piece. He came on against Wasps in the Premiership and was always looking to carry the ball and dented them a few times, similarly against Bath. I think he has that extra bit to his game and it\u2019s good, it\u2019s what you need. \u201cI think if you look at the way he carries the ball I think he has a unique part to his game, which is probably his standout feature. Having seen him for the past three-four months at Leicester he\u2019s got that. The other parts of his game are solid.\u201d The England forward\u200bs\u200b coach, Steve Borthwick, added: \u201cI met him very early on in my time [at Bristol]\u200b and he was so keen for feedback on how he could get better. He wanted to look at his video, he wanted to do things and practise. What I saw was a guy who wanted to maximise what he had. He\u2019s come here and done really well this week. \u201cMy experience of Ellis, in my short time at Bristol and here, has been entirely positive. He is incredibly competitive, wants to be in the team, wants to carry the ball and scrummage well, and is desperate to learn. He\u2019s been a very good guy around the group.\u201d England\u2019s game \u200bagainst\u200b Wales on Sunday at Twickenhamis expected to be a sell-out, although there have bee\u200bn\u200b criticisms of the fixture, given the timing at the end of the season and the fact that many players will be \u200bunavailable because of the Premiership final between Saracens and Exeter on Saturday.",
