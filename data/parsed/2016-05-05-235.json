  "body": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is preparing for the biggest political event of his career \u2013 a once-in-a-generation coming together of the Korean Workers\u2019 Party, an institution described as the \u201cbackbone of the state\u201d. As with other events of great national pride \u2013 like the annual Pyongyang marathon, or any basketball game associated with Dennis Rodman \u2013 130 international journalists have been invited to report on the spectacle otherwise know as the seventh party congress.  But while the regime seems happy to allow a foreign tourism industry to operate and to grant visas to the occasional overseas student, journalists asking questions about the numbers held in prison camps or interviewing ordinary North Koreans is not an option. Yet the world is thirsty for any drops of information from North Korea, so how do reporters who are granted access balance the need to scrutinise with staying in the favour of their regime minders? As news reports from the BBC, The Washington Post and Reuters have demonstrated this week, describing the country as \u201creclusive\u201d or \u201coppressive\u201d is OK, but trying to get a quote from someone you shouldn\u2019t isn\u2019t. Martyn Williams, editor of North Korea Tech, a blog monitoring media output from the country for more than 20 years, explains that it\u2019s all about treading a delicate balance \u2013 while remembering that the DPRK\u2019s propaganda machine isn\u2019t as sophisticated as we might think. \u201cThe minders will readily ask a cameraman to delete a certain picture they don\u2019t like, but will [also] quite happily provide TV crews with a shot sure to make them look bad \u2013 [such as] the hand going over the camera lens,\u201d he says.  As for reporting the really critical stuff? You wait until you get home, he suggests.    My North Korean minder just gave me a \"reporter\" armband - as if I might go unnoticed through Pyongyang without it pic.twitter.com/kLk0IdCgG3\u2014 Anna Fifield (@annafifield) May 4, 2016    Talking about the challenges of reporting from North Korea, The Washington Post\u2019s Anna Fifield has previously written of the \u201cthrill\u201d of getting \u201can elusive visa.... yet so maddening when you realise that you\u2019re moving through a kind of real-life Truman Show.\u201d Fifield is one of the handful of journalists who landed in Pyoynang this week and, making use of the \u201csurprisingly fast internet\u201d, has since taken to Twitter to share snapshots of the country. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned so far:  Reporting starts at the airport Visas maybe difficult to come by but some might argue that the hardest thing about getting to North Korea is getting on the plane: Air Koryo, the government carrier, has been ranked the world\u2019s worst airline four times in a row.  For others, the airport is the place to start documenting their rare trip, from the departure lounge onwards.  The BBC\u2019s Rupert Wingfield-Hayes used his seemingly smooth landing in \u201cone of the most isolated, impoverished and repressive places of earth\u201d to introduce his first news piece.  In a testament to North Korea\u2019s erratic visa process \u2013 which has previously approved celebrities from American rapper Pras from the Fugees to feminist activist Gloria Steinem \u2013 the BBC team has been joined by three Nobel laureates and Prince Alfred of Liechtenstein.

On Wednesday, the BBC was greeted at Pyongyang\u2019s Kim Il-sung university by a group of students pledging to \u201cglorify\u201d their country just as their \u201cfounding dictator intended\u201d.  When a student was asked about his views on nuclear weapons, his reply seemed to come straight from the government\u2019s propaganda-heavy hymn sheet, claiming that the US and South Korea are trying to eliminate the DPRK, so they need their nuclear arsenal for self-defence. A few days earlier, Wingfield-Hayes\u2019 team had attempted to speak to two bystanders at a hospital who presumably had not been given the OK to talk, and they quickly ran away. Slices of life  Other journalists made use of their internet access to share the narrow prism of daily life the government is happy for the world to see, from a daycare centre to the streets of the capital where only the elite are allowed to live.

According to Williams only a handful of citizens have internet access and \u201cthe so-called elites have access to a domestic network that looks like the internet but only connects to websites run by official institutions.\u201d Celebrations will be revolutionary With just a day until the congress kicks off and citizens preparing for the celebrations, NK News reported that KCNA, the state\u2019s main broadcaster, had run an editorial using terms including \u201cbattle\u201d, \u201cvictory\u201d, \u201cachievement\u201d and \u201crevolution\u201d more than 100 times.

Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters    With the minders of international journalists sure to have been briefed along similar lines, how much can the world hope to learn from their reports?  \u201cEven if movement is controlled and information rationed, nothing beats building understanding of North Korea than being there,\u201d says Williams.  \u201cThe more reporters get to see under the surface, even just a little, the more likely we are to get more nuanced coverage and more understanding that goes past the propaganda.\u201d",
