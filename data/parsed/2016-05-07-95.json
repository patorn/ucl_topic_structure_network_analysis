  "body": "In an electrifying exchange on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, repeatedly refused to answer presenter Sarah Montague\u2019s question over whether London would be safe with Sadiq Khan as its new mayor, in the light of remarks made by Fallon during the course of the election campaign. The full exchange ran as follows:  Sarah Montague Given what you said then, are you now worried about London\u2019s safety?   Michael Fallon Well, let me first of all congratulate Sadiq Khan on winning. He won an impressive majority last night and we look forward to working with him, working with a Conservative government to continue the investment and growth in this great capital city of ours that Boris Johnson managed so successfully by working alongside a Conservative government. But yes, I congratulate him.   SM But my question was whether you are \u2013 given what you\u2019ve said about him \u2013 whether you are now worried about London\u2019s security?   MF Well, questions were asked about the platforms that he\u2019d shared with various extremists, and those questions were asked during the election not just by us but by the media too on your own programmes. He answered those questions. Now he is elected the mayor we must work with him, and we want to work with him for a successful London by investing more in transport and housing and making sure London continues to grow successfully for all Londoners.   SM OK, so the questions were asked. And your answer to the question about whether you are worried about London\u2019s security, can you answer that one?   MF Well, we would have preferred Zac Goldsmith to win. He was the Conservative candidate: we wanted him.   SM Sure. So therefore, is London now\u00a0\u2013   MF We would have wanted him [Goldsmith] to win, but, you know, the result is there. We absolutely accept the result, more than that \u2013   SM Forgive me. I\u2019m so sorry for interrupting, but this is the third time I\u2019ve asked you. Because you said he was unfit and cannot be trusted, I\u2019m not surprisingly asking the defence secretary of this country if he\u2019s worried about the safety of London. You haven\u2019t said that you are not.   MF Well, I\u2019m hoping that we can work with Sadiq Khan. Stuff gets said during elections, questions get posed. I hope you\u2019re not suggesting that people\u2019s records, the platforms they\u2019ve shared, the policy positions they have, shouldn\u2019t be properly scrutinised and tested and challenged during the election.   SM I\u2019m not suggesting that. I\u2019m asking if you\u2019re worried about the safety of London now that we have Sadiq Khan as its mayor \u2013 and you can\u2019t say that you\u2019re not.   MF No I\u2019m not saying that at all, I\u2019m saying that we\u2019re going to work with Sadiq Khan not just to keep London safe but to go on investing in London and its growth and its housing and its transport infrastructure, as we did with Boris Johnson.   SM It seems striking \u2013 forgive me for not leaving this subject \u2013 but it seems striking that you cannot say London is safe now under its new mayor.   MF London is safe with a Conservative government working with the new mayor of London, yes.",
