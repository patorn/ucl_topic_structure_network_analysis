Related: Claudio Ranieri: an apology | Marcus Christenson    Preceded by a man dressed as a samurai and flanked by dozens of police on motorbikes, the blue-painted bus with manager Claudio Ranieri and team cruised along Sukhumvit Road, which cuts through the capital. \u201cI took off work to come,\u201d said Oi Oi, a 30-year-old woman who stood with a blue hat on a T-shirt saying \u201cForever Fearless\u201d, one of the club\u2019s slogans. Others had blue transfer tattoos of the club\u2019s emblem as well as blowup batons to wave as the bus drove by. \u201cThere\u2019s a Thai owner and a Japanese player. So this is Asia\u2019s team,\u201d said Lin Nu, a 50-year-old hospital employee who came with several friends from Leicester City\u2019s Thai fan site.  On Thursday morning, the team posed for a photo in the royal palace in which they all stood on their knees, a sign of respect for the much-revered Thai king Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world\u2019s longest serving monarch.

Some players, including strikers Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, did not come. Slightly dazzled after a red-eye from London, the team arrived to cheers of \u201cchampions\u201d and fans at the airport placed flowered garlands around their necks. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some special receptions when we\u2019ve arrived in Thailand in the past, but nothing like this. This is incredible,\u201d said team captain Wes Morgan. \u201cWe\u2019re always extremely proud to come here and we know how much it means to the owners, who have done so much for us and for the entire club in the last six years.\u201d     Leicester City parade the Premier League trophy in Bangkok. Photograph: Jorge Silva/Reuters    Owner Vichai has made huge efforts to bolster the visit and there were King Power employees with \u201cstaff\u201d written on their shirts arranging the crowds along the streets during the victory tour. Some foreign tourists had also stopped to watch.  When Leicester City players visited Thailand a year ago, it ended in scandal as three players were caught in a racist sex tape and were later fired, including the son of former manager Nigel Pearson. The team have been warned by Vichai\u2019s son, Aiyawatt, that they should behave. \u201cI want them to see the Thai people, how welcome they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are massive now and they want to say thank you to the Thai fans.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe players need privacy as well, but I\u2019ve talked to them and they know they need to treat everything well.\u201d",
