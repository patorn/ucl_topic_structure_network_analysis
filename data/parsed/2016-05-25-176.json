Maybe too easy, in fact, because to laugh is to dismiss it, denigrate it \u2013 ignore the fact that many of us have found comfort and joy in pretending to be animals at some point in our lives. Secret Life of the Human Pups is a sympathetic look at the world of pup play, a movement that grew out of the BDSM community and has exploded in the last 15 years as the internet made it easier to reach out to likeminded people. While the pup community is a broad church, human pups tend to be male, gay, have an interest in dressing in leather, wear dog-like hoods, enjoy tactile interactions like stomach rubbing or ear tickling, play with toys, eat out of bowls and are often in a relationship with their human \u201chandlers\u201d. In the documentary, we see Tom, AKA Spot, take part in the Mr Puppy Europe competition in Antwerp, a mix of beauty pageant, talent show and Crufts; David, AKA Bootbrush, talk to camera in a leather dog mask; two pups walk through London pretending to wee on lampposts to raise awareness of their identity; and lots of men jumping up for \u201ctreats\u201d, barking and wagging their mechanical tails. When I speak to Tom, he is keen to point out that puppy play is about more than just outfits and surface-level power games: it\u2019s about being given licence to behave in a way that feels natural, even primal. \u201cYou\u2019re not worrying about money, or food, or work,\u201d says Tom, who works as an engineer in a theatre. \u201cIt\u2019s just the chance to enjoy each other\u2019s company on a very simple level.\u201d     Spot, Hexyc and Tibo. Photograph: Richard Ansett/Channel 4    Tom\u2019s discovery of puppy play came about gradually. He knew he liked sleeping in a collar, had a fetish for skin-tight clothing \u2013 Lycra, rubber, even off-the-peg cycling shorts \u2013 then came a dalmatian zentai suit he found on eBay, a \u00a31 orange lead from Pets at Home until, eventually, a man in a club walked up to him and said: \u201cOh right, so you\u2019re a pup.\u201d The realisation was not without its repercussions: it led to a breakup with his former fiancee Rachel and a move into a gay relationship with his new handler. Colin.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was the catalyst, but it was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d says Tom. \u201cThen I had this moment of panic because a puppy without a collar is a stray; they don\u2019t have anyone to look after them. I started chatting to Colin online and he offered to look after me. It\u2019s a sad thing to say, but there\u2019s not love from the heart in me for Colin \u2013 but what I have got is someone who is there for me and I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d For David, a writer who works in academia, puppy play is an escape from the analytical world. \u201cIt\u2019s so totally non-verbal,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s pre-rational, pre-conscious. It\u2019s an instinctive, emotional space. But within every puppy is a person. This is part of my identity, but it\u2019s only part. I\u2019m also a vegetarian, play the piano; I have a parrot. I was planting tomatoes on my allotment this morning. I can go months without going into pup space.\u201d  The psychiatrist Carl Jung argued that our conscious minds contain intuitive, emotional, sensation and thinking archetypes. Are the sort of men drawn to puppy play simply exploring their intuitive self? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says David. \u201cPuppy play is exactly that \u2013 play. There is an immense amount of pleasure from gambolling around in a club playing with squeaky toys because you\u2019re making people laugh, you\u2019re being a cute little puppy. The gay scene can be very serious, scary and offputting. But if you\u2019re going in with a little puppy hood, ears and a tongue, you look cute. You\u2019re allowed to bound around and be enthusiastic, mischievous and friendly.\u201d         Watch the trailer for Secret Life of the Human Pups.     Kaz, another pup, argues that for some, being a puppy isn\u2019t just a fun mask to try on \u2013 it\u2019s how they identify; it\u2019s who they are. \u201cEven when I worked in PC World I would sometimes walk up to people and nip at their shirt,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI got in trouble once; someone walked into the PC repair centre and I had part of their dad\u2019s computer in my mouth. But the other staff knew I was like that to everyone. They didn\u2019t find it weird.\u201d For Kaz, pup play can be summed up in the phrase: \u201cBe dog\u201d. He will socialise as a pack, enjoy physical closeness with other pups and always eats out of a dog bowl at home. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice, it makes me feel comfortable,\u201d he explains, before adding \u201cBut I always eat with a knife and fork and at a table. Otherwise it\u2019s time-consuming and you can\u2019t watch TV.\u201d What is the attraction, for pups and their handlers? \u201cYou are trying to grasp the positive elements of the archetype of the dog; the loyal companion,\u201d says David. \u201cSome pups are solo, of course, but for me the puppy identity is focused on the bond between me and Sidney, my handler. I\u2019ve been collared to him for 10 years. If anyone comes near him I growl like a little bull terrier. And I\u2019m a people-pleaser in my human life. I get a great deal of pleasure from making other people happy.\u201d Then, of course, there is the sex. Puppy play is often part of a larger sexual practice that crosses over with leather folk, furries and BDSM. But, as Kaz is keen to point out, not always. \u201cPeople automatically jump to the conclusion that this is gear we wear to have sex. I used to get asked awful questions like, if I liked having sex with dogs. But it\u2019s certainly not that, and it\u2019s not always sexual. Members of my pack, we spend a lot of time together at home just being dogs. There\u2019s nine of us and my partner is our handler. A big part of it is a feeling of family and belonging; we\u2019re there to look after each other.\u201d Whether we see it as a kink, an identity, a reaction to an early experience, a form of escapism or a fetish, the main thing, says Tom, is that we see it at all; that we know it\u2019s there and accept it. \u201cIt feels like you can be gay, straight, bisexual, trans and be accepted,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I want is for the pup community to be accepted in the same way. We\u2019re not trying to cause grief to the public, or cause grief to relationships. We\u2019re just the same as any other person on the high street.\u201d \u2022 Secret Life of the Human Pups is available to view on All4 now.",
