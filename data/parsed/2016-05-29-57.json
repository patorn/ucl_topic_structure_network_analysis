  "body": "So is your glass half full or half empty? That was the question asked of Katarina Johnson-Thompson after she achieved Olympic qualification at the prestigious G\u00f6tzis Hypo-Meeting in Austria on Sunday. The 23-year-old smiled back and insisted she is always a glass-half-full person and had seen \u201cglimpses\u201d of form that had delighted and excited her. Yet her score of 6,304 \u2013 nearly 400 points below her personal best \u2013 and particularly two very scratchy performances in the shot and the long jump were a jolting reminder that she has plenty to work on, too. \u201cThis is why people do a heptathlon before the big one,\u201d she said after finishing sixth behind the Canadian Brianne Theisen-Eaton, who won with 6,765 points. \u201cYou need to put one together to see exactly what you need to work on and I know I\u2019ve got another two metres in my shot put, another height in my high jump, definitely another 70cm in the long jump and my javelin I need to work on as well.\u201d Yet there were enough snatches of Johnson-Thompson\u2019s almost limitless potential, in particular personal bests in the 100m hurdles and a brilliant 22.79sec 200m on Saturday, to suggest that she could leave Rio with a gold medal round her neck. Certainly she believes there is plenty more in the tank. \u201cMy goal is definitely a gold medal still in Rio,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to work on between now and then but this is my first time back after surgery and I know exactly what I need to work on.\u201d With two months to go before the Olympics begin Johnson-Thompson is clearly fit and very focused. But while there is little wrong with her body, she confesses her mind is still a work in progress.   Related: Jessica Ennis-Hill withdraws from G\u00f6tzis heptathlon meeting    Johnson-Thompson started day two knowing the 6,200 points needed for Olympic qualification would be almost a certainty if she could land a half-decent long jump. But she was carrying baggage. At the world championships in Beijing in August last year she had fouled three times while in contention for a gold and the memories were still vivid. Her first effort was understandably tentative and she took off long before the board. When the scoreboard flashed a distance of 6.13m, nearly 80cm below her best, she seemed to laugh in embarrassment when the crowd whooped in appreciation. However, her subsequent two jumps left her grimacing and suggested that those mental demons from Beijing have not yet been fully exorcised. She was red\u2011flagged on her second jump and stuttered again before her third leap, which was only 6.17m. No wonder she had her head in her hands afterwards. \u201cI was sick especially in the first jump,\u201d said Johnson-Thompson, who was also wearing strapping on her left thigh as a precaution. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to push and injure myself. After what happened last year I just wanted to stay uninjured. \u201cThe feeling is one of relief more than anything else. But I\u2019m not going to lie. There will be mental worries with the long jump before Rio but I know I can get through it. It\u2019s just getting my confidence back. I know I have a big jump in me. But the shot put is more of a concern. It\u2019s just the mental pressure of competition.\u201d Johnson-Thompson took it steady in the javelin, producing a below-par throw of 36.66m for 603 points before jogging round the 800m in 2min 16.81sec for 867 points. That was understandable. What she does here will be forgotten when Rio rolls round. There was less cheery news for Morgan Lake, Britain\u2019s other competitor in G\u00f6tzis. She, too, had been hoping to qualify for Rio but withdrew from the competition after the first day following a disappointing performance. She is still young at 19 and has time to improve but it will worry her and others in British Athletics that she has appeared to have stood still since bursting on to the scene two years ago. \u201cIt was always a gamble coming to G\u00f6tzis after missing a block of training due to injuries,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThis is not a reflection of where I know my potential and form is and I\u2019m sorry to let so many people down. \u201cDisappointed doesn\u2019t even come close to how I feel right now but it has made me even more determined to get the qualifying score and fight for my place in Rio.\u201d",
