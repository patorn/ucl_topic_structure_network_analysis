  "body": "The justice minister Dominic Raab has said the European Union is in \u201cviolation of international law\u201d for failing to take steps required by the UN to tackle corruption. Raab, a high-profile Brexit campaigner, said the EU had so far failed to take the first step in implementing the UN convention against corruption, despite approving it in 2008.   Brexit explained: intelligence sharing   He pointed to a statement by Transparency International, an NGO, which said the EU should be \u201cmildly embarrassed\u201d given that it had claimed to be at the forefront of this debate. The group said: \u201cEight years after ratifying the convention they have failed to implement the first step, which is an assessment of its own anti-corruption rules and capacities. This baffling delay does not help its cause when engaging with its member states on anti-corruption matters.\u201d Raab also pointed out that there had been a huge increase in the amount of EU money linked to irregularity or fraud.  The European anti-fraud office (Olaf) identified \u20ac901m (\u00a3685m) to be recovered in 2014, the most recent figures available, compared with \u20ac194m in 2011. Raab said it represented \u201csystemic fraud\u201d. The most recent year also had a record 1,417 fraud allegations, he said. Raab argued that the figures ought to raise serious concern given Britain\u2019s net contribution to the EU, which he said was \u00a310bn. \u201cWe are pouring huge amounts of money into the EU, huge sums that could be spent on schools and hospitals and whatever else British elected lawmakers decide. People ask, understandably, why are you pouring it into the EU, which has got these rising reports of fraud?\u201d he said. \u201cWhile you\u2019ve got systemic fraud within the EU, Transparency international have put their hand up and said: hold on a minute, the EU has signed the UN convention against corruption and eight years after having ratified it and approved it, it hasn\u2019t done the first step which is to have a systematic analysis of its practices.\u201d The NGO itself, which is neutral in the referendum debate, sought to play down its recent statement on the EU\u2019s lack of action. A spokesman described it as an \u201cembarrassment rather than an issue of overwhelming significance\u201d. He added: \u201cBut it does suggest that the EU has not prioritised assessing its own compliance with the world\u2019s most wide-ranging anti-corruption convention.\u201d  The spokesman indicated that Transparency International was not keen to be drawn into the debate over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, adding: \u201cWe are a non-political organisation and this is a highly politicised debate, therefore we have no further comment at this time.\u201d Raab said the organisation had documented systemic risks of corruption at EU institutions and asked if it was now \u201cscared of a backlash from the establishment\u201d. He said: \u201cWith reports of fraud at the EU soaring to record levels, British taxpayers will view this is as more than just presentational embarrassment.\u201d A European commission spokesman said: \u201cWe have zero tolerance for fraud against the EU budget. Olaf\u2019s work is part and parcel of the efforts to uncover and prevent fraud in the member states, including the UK, and to get money returned to the taxpayers.\u201d A spokeswoman for Olaf said its job was to seek the recovery of EU funds defrauded in the member states, or to prevent additional amounts being disbursed. \u201cTypical examples of Olaf investigations relate to public procurement fraud, evasion of customs duties or smuggling of goods,\u201d she said. \u201cAs member states are in charge of managing most of the EU budget, they are responsible for recovering any money which has been subject to irregularity or fraud from the beneficiaries. It is important to note that this money will progressively be recovered.\u201d She argued that the very large sums identified for recovery in 2014 were linked to complex investigations, suggesting the rise in numbers wasn\u2019t simply down to a spike in fraud. A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe described Raab\u2019s intervention as \u201cdesperate stuff\u201d. The spokesman said: \u201cHe is trying to pull to wool over people\u2019s eyes. Even the organisation he cites admits this is not a significant issue.\u201d",
