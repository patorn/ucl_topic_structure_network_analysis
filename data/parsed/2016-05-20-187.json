  "body": "1: Wrecking Ball Action Hero\u2019s latest show is a clever and coolly manipulative look at what is real and what is constructed, how authority is made and how easily we can be influenced. Set in a studio where a sleazy photographer is doing a shoot with a celebrity, this is a show that seduces even as it questions our beliefs. Bristol Old Vic, Sat & Sun 2: Tonight I\u2019m Gonna Be The New Me   Love is very much a performance in Made In China\u2019s smart and distinctly discomfiting show in which Jess \u2013 seen on stage throughout \u2013 appears to be dissecting her relationship with partner Tim, who operates the lights and sound behind the scenes. The notion of control is constantly under scrutiny here, in a piece that undercuts gender stereotypes even as it appears to reinforce them. This is a short, sharp punch of a production that\u2019s so unflinching you almost feel guilty for enjoying it. Norwich Arts Centre, Mon 3: Boy It\u2019s your last chance this week to see Leo Butler\u2019s big, compassionate and conscience-pricking journey around the capital in the company of Liam (the brilliant Frankie Fox), a lonely teenager with no money and no prospects. In Sacha Wares\u2019s fluid staging, he passes through London like a ghost, occasionally bumping up against authority. It\u2019s a production that doesn\u2019t let its audience off the hook, challenging our willingness to only see the version of the world we want to see. Almeida Theatre, N1, to 28 May 4: People, Places And Things Denise Gough\u2019s Olivier-winning performance as Emma, an actor hooked on drink and drugs, has deservedly been praised to the heavens. But Duncan MacMillan\u2019s drama \u2013 set largely in a residential rehab centre \u2013 is very clever and slippery, too, and the whole thing is neatly packaged by director Jeremy Herrin. An enthralling, often viciously funny evening that makes you question notions of identity and addiction. Wyndham\u2019s Theatre, WC2, to 18 Jun 5: Matilda The Musical It\u2019s rare for a page-to-stage adaptation to surpass the original material, but that\u2019s the case with Tim Minchin and Dennis Kelly\u2019s witty version of Roald Dahl\u2019s tale of a girl with a brilliant mind and parents from hell. This vibrant production by Matthew Warchus will have you cheering her all the way in the fight to take control of her own story and defeat the fiendish Miss Trunchbull. Cambridge Theatre, WC2, to 28 May 2017",
