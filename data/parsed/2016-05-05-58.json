  "body": "\u2022 A feature about Sutton Coldfield\u2019s town council elections began with a description of one of the candidates, Terry Johnson, but named him as another independent candidate, Terry Leeson. The online version of the article went on to say that a group of independent councillors met in a local pub until the landlord \u201csigned up as a Conservative candidate and chucked them out\u201d. In fact it was the group\u2019s choice to meet elsewhere (Will it be independents\u2019 day at England\u2019s biggest parish council?, 4\u00a0May, page 40). \u2022 A subheading in early editions of Wednesday\u2019s paper referred to an extremism bill that had been trailed in last year\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech going through dozens of \u201cdraughts\u201d. That should have been \u201cdrafts\u201d. In addition, the Queen\u2019s speech was in May last year, not October (Legal fears stall new laws to tackle extremism, 4 May, page 7). \u2022 A letter which referred to the book The Spirit Level gave the authors as Kate Wilkinson and Richard Pickett; they are Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson. The mistake was ours, not the letter writer\u2019s (Spirit Level\u2019s lessons, 4 May, page 34).",
