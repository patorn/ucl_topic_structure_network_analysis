  "body": "An application to hold a retrial of the murders of three Aboriginal children in Bowraville, New South Wales, more than 26 years ago will be put before the NSW supreme court. The attorney general, Gabrielle Upton, who received the application from NSW police on Tuesday, said she decided to refer the matter directly to court, rather then wait for the opinion of an independent assessor. \u201cAfter careful consideration, I have decided that there should be no further delay in bringing this matter to court,\u201d Upton said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cThe best and most transparent way to deal with this tragic case is to make an application for retrial to the NSW court of criminal appeal.\u201d The children \u2013 four-year-old Evelyn Greenup and 16-year-olds Colleen Walker and Clinton Speedy-Duroux \u2013 disappeared from Bowraville within five months during 1990 and 1991. In separate trials a local man, Jay Thomas Hart, was found not guilty of murdering Clinton and Evelyn, whose bodies were found in bushland on the outskirts of town, but the commissioner, Andrew Scipione, sent a submission to Upton, calling for Hart\u2019s retrial on Tuesday. Colleen\u2019s clothing was pulled from a nearby river but her body has never been found. Upton said it was in the public interest that the court be allowed to decide if new evidence presented by police was sufficiently \u201cfresh and compelling\u201d to warrant a new trial under the state\u2019s double jeopardy laws. The application is also for all three murders to be heard as a single trial, which has been rejected by the court before. \u201cWhile there can be no certainty whatsoever about the outcome, this is the course of action that promises a sense of closure for all involved,\u201d Upton said. Colleen\u2019s brother Lucas Craig told AAP he was overwhelmed and happy at the decision. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up seeing my mum being let down so many times, and to see her face change this afternoon ... it feels like we\u2019re finally being heard,\u201d he said on Tuesday evening. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to take it all in. \u201cThis is a step forward that we needed.\u201d The case will be argued by Wendy Abraham QC, the former South Australian director of public prosecutions. Lucas Craig was eight when his sister Colleen disappeared. He was pleased police had made the referral but was not confident it would result in a trial. The application has been rejected twice in recent years. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to get our hopes up so soon because we have been let down so many times,\u201d Craig told Guardian Australia. \u201cSeeing what they say put into action is when we will probably start feeling better about it. It\u2019s just you get your hopes up all the time and then get let down; you just kind of give up on the words that they say. It\u2019s like they just say it to make themselves look good.\u201d In an 18-volume brief of evidence, Scipione\u2019s submission reportedly alleges Hart is linked to all three killings and details new evidence unearthed in a fresh investigation by DCI Gary Jubelin. The new evidence, according to the Australian, is the evidence of two delivery drivers who claim they saw a white man, matching Hart\u2019s description, standing over an Aboriginal teenager who was lying on the road outside Bowraville the morning Clinton disappeared.

Lawyers for the families have previously argued that because the cases had not been heard in a joint trial before, evidence for each murder could be considered fresh and compelling from the perspective of the other murders.  But previous applications, which have been decided by two former attorney generals and the director of public prosecutions, have ruled on a narrower definition of \u201cfresh\u201d evidence, meaning that anything which has been included in a brief of evidence by the prosecution, whether it was admitted by the court and put before a jury or not, could not be considered \u201cfresh\u201d evidence. In 2014, after a 12-month investigation, a NSW parliamentary inquiry found flaws in the way police had investigated the crimes. At the time, Jubelin, who has worked on the case since 1996, said families had been let down by the justice system. He told the inquiry that race had affected how the murders were investigated, and said there were overwhelming links between the murders and that they must be heard in a single trial. Upton previously said any application would be independently reviewed.     Media coverage of the case, including a five-part podcast made by the Australian, which described the deaths as Australia\u2019s \u201cleast-known serial killings\u201d, has brought it back to public attention. On the podcast Jubelin said: \u201cOne thing I found unique about this investigation, and I have been doing homicide for a long time and I get the sense of things that attract the public\u2019s attention, is here we have three kids murdered living in the same street and I am absolutely gobsmacked by the amount of people that have never heard of it.\u201d The podcast also included an interview with one of the delivery drivers, Michael Scaffidi, who told reporter Dan Box that he saw \u201can Aboriginal juvenile \u2013 18, 17, 16, in his late teens \u2013 laying on the road\u201d and that another man, who he described as \u201cCaucasian, white\u201d emerged from the side of the road. Greens MP David Shoebridge, who pushed for the parliamentary inquiry, said referral to the court of criminal appeal was testament to the unrelenting campaign waged by the families of the victims. \u201cThe families came time and again to parliament, demanding justice,\u201d he said. \u201cThey petitioned, they called, they wrote letters, emails and pleas. In short they never gave up. Today their efforts have borne fruit.\u201d Additional reporting by Australian Associated Press",
