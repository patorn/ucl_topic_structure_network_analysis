Helicopters landed on the side of the road and greeters darted across. At a farmers\u2019 market with overflowing baskets full of raspberries, watermelons, and focaccia, I asked for a mango, and the farmer started cutting it in half for me: \u201cThat\u2019ll be $7.\u201d This weekend, outside Las Vegas, a group of Burning Man veterans put on a festival called Further Future, now in its second year. Across 49 acres of Native American land over three days, with around 5,000 attendees, the event was the epitome of a new trend of so-called \u201ctransformational festivals\u201d that are drawing technologists for what\u2019s billed as a mix of fun and education. While tickets started at $350, many attendees opted for upgrades to fully staffed accommodation and fine dining. While Burning Man\u2019s hidden luxury camps on the edge of town are criticized by old time Burners who value labor on the desert, Further Future is a splinter group that\u2019s unapologetic about wanting a good, hard-labor-free time. \u201cUnabashed luxury,\u201d the website reads, in reference to its Lunar Palace accommodation. Burners are judged for using Wi-Fi or having private chefs; Further Future advertises its connectivity and personal festival assistant service. Nobu hosted a $250-a-seat dinner on the first night of the festival. Partiers included Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet; Clear Channel CEO Bob Pittman; and top Facebook executive Stan Chudnovsky.    This is a high percentage of San Francisco entrepreneurs, and they tend to be winners  Eric Schmidt, Alphabet executive chairman        Further Future festival: \u2018We\u2019re shaping the future.\u2019 Photograph: Tomas Loewy    \u201cIt\u2019s the Burning Man 1%,\u201d said Charles, a documentary filmmaker with spikes pierced through his ears and a brainwave meditation startup. \u201cIt\u2019s curated.\u201d Eric Schmidt was backstage leaning against a tower of pallets and wearing an ornate top hat and a vest made of mirrors. He said he was at Further Future mostly because these were his friends. \u201cIt\u2019s well documented that I go to Burning Man. The future\u2019s driven by people with an alternative world view. You never know where you\u2019ll find ideas. \u201d This was the cream of the Burning Man crop, he said. \u201cThis is a high percentage of San Francisco entrepreneurs, and they tend to be winners. It\u2019s a curated, self-selected group of adults who have jobs,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cYou can tell by the percentage of trailers.\u201d Did they provide the costume for him? \u201cMy own, of course. What do you think of it?\u201d he pressed the glass panels and smiled.     Top of the crop: Eric Schmidt in his party hat. Photograph: Tomas Loewy      Party planners at Burning Man are careful to hide their luxury dwellings behind large walls dressed as art projects, but Further Future had no such pretension. Behind a chain-link fence was the VIP neighborhood with airstreams ($5,000) and Lunar Palaces ($7,500) \u2013 200 sq ft, 9ft high, custom-made luxury domes with wooden flooring and furnished to sleep four. These included something called an entourage concierge \u2013 \u201ca personal, dedicated lifestyle manager and assistant ready to help you with any requirements or desires you may have. No request is ever unattainable.\u201d The lifestyle assistant, who makes sure you have the soap you like, will work with you on everything \u201cfrom the green juice you enjoy every morning to the old-fashioned cocktail you sip on in the evenings\u201d.    In a shipping container converted to control room, I found Russell Ward, the general show runner and publicist who\u2019s the mastermind behind the most popular \u201ctransformational festivals\u201d. \u201cThis is top-league networking and business folks are all here in the guise of having fun. It\u2019s designed around the music, but it\u2019s about the business,\u201d Ward said. \u201cA ton of business will get done here. Entrepreneurs will get funded, investors will find their trajectories, service companies will meet and mix it up.\u201d Before running the tech world\u2019s hot new trend, Ward had an online gaming hedge fund. \u201cThe problem was it got hairy. It\u2019s a dodgy industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing anything illegal, but we got raided by the government, and I got spooked. So I had to decide where to plant my next seed, and I found this knack for festivals.\u201d    It\u2019s designed around music, but it\u2019s about business ... Entrepreneurs will get funded, investors will find trajectories  Russell Ward, Further Future coordinator     The aesthetic of the festival was \u201csteampunk futurism\u201d (latex underwear, fur coats, platform boots, metal headpieces). Ward was wearing a Hawaiian tank top, clear Gucci sunglasses, and a silver-coated bobcat claw on a chain. \u201cBurning Man, and we have great reverence for Burning Man, but there\u2019s always an element of arduousness. Here, we have spa treatments and green juice,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s already enough in life that\u2019s tough.\u201d Further Future is only one of several \u201ctransformations\u201d Ward runs, and they all overlap somewhat, especially MaiTai, the billionaire kiteboarding community centered around Virgin founder Richard Branson\u2019s island. \u201cKiteboarding is the new golf,\u201d Ward said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing it. Branson, Elon, Sergey.\u201d Justin Shaffer, an early Facebook employee and now an investor, says he wants Further Future to answer a new set of questions: \u201cWhat happens post-capitalism? Even post-democracy? What about post-employment, when we have universal basic income? \u201cPhysical proximity will become more important in a world where the first time you see the pyramids is in VR.\u201d     Keeping fit at Further Future. Photograph: Tomas Loewy    In the Wellness Tent, there\u2019s a fitness class with people jumping up and down in unison. Nearby, one woman advertises psychological services as \u201ctools and technology broken down for busy professionals\u201d. Another advertises \u201csmudging aura cleansing\u201d. To the side of the main wellness stage, a man is getting a transfusion in his arm from a bright yellow bag of fluid (a liter of saline and vitamins called Push IV). The patient reclines, half asleep, until someone accidentally knocks the bag over, jolting the needle in his arm. An espresso line stretches 45 minutes long for lavender lattes. During a wellness panel on \u201cAdventure Travel: Journey As Wellness\u201d, someone asks the instructor Fabian Piorkowski about privilege. \u201cWe\u2019re so privileged to come to these spiritual places \u2013 Further Future, Tulum \u2013 but not everyone can,\u201d the audience member says, asking Piorkowski how he should reconcile that.  \u201cIt\u2019s all about balance. We are the ones meant to be the air, not the earth,\u201d Piorkowski said. \u201cSo you have this group who can travel. The purpose can never be to enable everyone to travel because that would create imbalance.\u201d On stage, entrepreneur Lo\u00efc Le Meur is wearing a whole fox as a headpiece and interviewing Schmidt, who answers questions about blockchain (he\u2019s for it), eugenics (he\u2019s opposed), and cellphones (he\u2019s worried about addiction). Schmidt is beloved. The woman behind me shouts that he should run for president. Someone else says: \u201cMarry me, Eric.\u201d It was his birthday just a couple of days before, and everyone sings Happy Birthday. At dinner that night, everyone gets a slice of birthday cake.

The dinner party included a beer tasting, and the bartender was frustrated because the foie gras torchon was too fatty for a proper beer pairing. Schmidt and his pack headed out into the night. Robert Scott, the 42-year-old cofounder of the festival, said you don\u2019t need to sweat to have an epiphany.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways to find an epiphany. Being in the desert under hard conditions is one way to bring yourself into a receptive state, I suppose, but here, all these things are putting you in the same place gently,\u201d he said.  We sat at a table after a rainstorm, his shaggy brown hair disheveled.  \u201cIt\u2019s important what we do here,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we keep saying. We\u2019re shaping the future. These are the people who not only can do it, but these are the only people who can.\u201d  This article was amended on 24 May 2016 to clarify that the \u2018unabashed luxury\u2019 of the Burning Man camps advertised on Further Future\u2019s website referred to the Lunar Palace accommodation.",
