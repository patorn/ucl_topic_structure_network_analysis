For the past three months, 17 Boots stores have been offering a mole-scanning service to customers concerned they might have malignant melanoma, or skin cancer, which is diagnosed in more than 13,000 people every year. It costs \u00a335 per mole.   Related: Boots staff under pressure to milk the NHS for cash, says pharmacists' union    Sore-throat testing and treatment has been available in London and Leicestershire for 18 months. Boots says the consultation is free; but if the customer wants a swab to find out whether they have \u201cstrep A\u201d \u2013 a streptococcus bacterial infection that can be treated by antibiotics \u2013 it will cost \u00a37.50. They can then take the prescription to the GP or pay privately. Pharmacists have been encouraged to play a bigger role in the NHS, giving people advice and recommending over-the-counter treatments for minor complaints, such as eye infections. In a controversial move, they are permitted to offer emergency contraception, including to underage girls. Sore-throat testing could benefit the NHS if fewer people subsequently ask for antibiotics, but the notion of cancer screening has alarmed the British Medical Association. \u201cGPs welcome the opportunity to work with pharmacists collaboratively, which ultimately benefits the patients we jointly serve, but we need to be careful not to promote or develop systems that have the potential to fragment care and undermine the registered practice list system that is the bedrock of safe, high quality and cost-effective primary health care,\u201d said Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the BMA\u2019s general practitioners committee.  \u201cIn addition, whilst pharmacies can play an important role in supporting practices deliver NHS minor ailment schemes we should avoid the slippery slope that ends up with patients having to pay for things they would otherwise get free on the NHS. \u201cWhat we really need is significant investment in general practice to allow an expansion of the workforce, including the employment of pharmacists in the practice, to enable easier access to appointments.\u201d      Dan Hurley, an in-house pharmacist at Gale Farm GP surgery in Acomb, York. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian    Vautrey\u2019s comments came as NHS England announced that community pharmacists would again be commissioned to offer flu jabs on the NHS. GPs have reservations, saying that makes it hard for their practices to decide how much vaccine to order. Last year they were left with fridges full of vaccines, they say, as the numbers attending the GP practice for a jab dropped by 6%. Suspicion about the commercial motivation of Boots is already running high. Managers have recently been exposed for pressuring their pharmacists to carry out unnecessary reviews of patients\u2019 medicines and lifestyles to make the store more money. A Guardian investigation revealed that some managers were instructing pharmacists to do the reviews on other staff or patients who did not need them. But the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, which represents pharmacists, says the new services can help relieve the pressure on the NHS. Sandra Gidley, chair of the society\u2019s English pharmacy board, said the NHS had limited funding and limited capacity because of it. Some people already bypass the NHS to get faster access to minor treatment and checks. Gidley, a former Liberal Democrat MP who works as a locum pharmacist, said she has seen parents in urban Southampton go to their GP to get pain-relieving syrup for their children, which working parents in Winchester will buy from the chemist. \u201cIt is quicker and easier for them, if they can afford it, to buy it from their local pharmacist,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we already have a system where people could get the item if they chose to for free, but choose not to because it\u2019s not convenient. This [skin cancer screening] is another product in that category. There are those who have a concern who would go to the GP and those who might find it difficult to get to a GP and think, \u2018I might just pop along to the pharmacist and put my mind at rest.\u2019 \u201cIf that is taking some of the pressure off the NHS, I don\u2019t see a problem with that.\u201d She said patients in some parts of the country suffered long waits to see a GP, and gave the example of increasing numbers of women using over-the-counter pregnancy tests rather than going to a GP, as technology had evolved to make the kits easy and reliable.  However, Gidley said, might it be more sensible for the NHS to commission and pay for pharmacy services as required? Boots said it was committed to the NHS and that its pharmacists were \u201cpartners\u201d alongside GPs and other primary care professionals. A spokesperson said: \u201cPharmacists in community pharmacy have a professional expertise that can be used to help relieve pressure on the NHS and offer patients more choice and access to services to help them stay well, get the most out of their medicines and manage long-term conditions. \u201cAs part of their professional duty of care, a pharmacist will always make it clear to a customer if an NHS service is available that they are eligible for.\u201d There are bound to be concerns, however, that people will be more likely to buy products from the pharmacy out of a sense of gratitude or obligation to the pharmacist who gave the recommendation. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, added: \u201cI agree that pharmacists are an under-utilised resource \u2026 but we\u2019ve got to be careful and scrutinise private providers creeping into the NHS. When they see an opportunity, is the opportunity for the patient or for their own gain?\u201d",
