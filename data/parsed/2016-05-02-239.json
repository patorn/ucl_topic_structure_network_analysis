But this soon turned to resignation when she accepted that the unaffordable hike would mean she had to move to another flat \u2013 her eighth move in eight years. \u201cThe contract was coming up for renewal and we were told the rent was increasing to \u00a32,800 a month [from \u00a31,800],\u201d says the 34-year-old, who shares a two-bedroom flat in Camden with a couple. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad as I loved it, and the landlord let us get two cats only a few months ago. I\u2019ve only been there around a year, and the last rise was only about \u00a370, so this was a total shock.\u201d Miller\u2019s frustration at the price of renting is common, and has led to calls for the introduction of European-style rent controls whereby caps are put on how much landlords can raise prices. In her case there was no explanation for the increase. Although the tenants disputed it and got the price reduced by 15%, it still remained too much and she will have to move. \u201cMy friends are facing similar situations,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes sense that rents rise in line with inflation \u2013 but more should be done to stop insane rises.\u201d She is not alone in her wish for stiffer regulations. According to a poll conducted by Spareroom.com, 65% of renters support some form of controls. Dan Wilson Craw from Generation Rent, a group which campaigns for professionally managed homes, says: \u201cWe need rent control not for the sake of it, but because the housing market is broken. Demand for housing should encourage greater supply, and result in rents that are affordable \u2013 but that isn\u2019t happening.\u201d           Exploitation, Exploitation, Exploitation: a property show for millennials    Laws in other European countries have put the brakes on soaring rents. Since June 2015, landlords in Berlin have been prevented from raising rents for new tenants to more than 10% above the local average. The aim is to keep the city affordable, with the model being copied in Hamburg and hundreds of other towns and cities around the country. \u201cEngland has regulations in place, but they are incredibly weak and ineffective,\u201d says John Bibby, a policy officer at housing charity Shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for landlords to impose excessive rent increases, with tenants able to choose between paying up, or moving out.\u201d Labour pledged to introduce rent controls in its 2015 election manifesto. Former leader Ed Miliband said rises should be limited to inflation over a three-year period, and tenancy lengths of three years should become the norm. A report from the London Assembly\u2019s housing committee in March produced strong reactions, but politicians failed to reach agreement on what various measures \u2013 such as capping rises and providing longer tenancies \u2013 would achieve.    Regulations are in place, but they are weak and ineffective. It\u2019s easy for landlords to impose rent rises  John Bibby, Shelter     There are pitfalls to hardline caps, according to commentators. \u201cRent caps are the most onerous of regulations,\u201d says Bibby. \u201cConcerns include landlords withdrawing from the market, and this could trigger evictions.\u201d Property analyst Kate Faulkner says rent controls may actually penalise some tenants. \u201cThe biggest problem is they haven\u2019t been proven to work anywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cIt risks landlords selling up, and doesn\u2019t tackle the main problem \u2013 a lack of stock.\u201d She says landlords often have an interest in keeping good tenants and rents fixed. \u201cContractually, landlords may be more likely to put rents up in line with whatever the cap allows \u2013 penalising the very people they are designed to protect.\u201d Germany is often held up as the model of stabilisation, with many people living in the same property for life. Kath Scanlon, a researcher at the London School of Economics, authored a 2011 report entitled Towards a sustainable private rented sector, and said it would be difficult to replicate the system in the UK. \u201cThe Berlin system requires a sophisticated database of private sector rents, and that\u2019s an area where statistics in this country are very poor. Imposing rent caps would be perceived by landlords as the final nail in the coffin after the reduction in mortgage interest rate relief and the new stamp duty surcharge,\u201d she says. In Scotland a private tenancies bill was passed in March. This will introduce powers for local authorities to implement rent controls, and is expected to come into force over the next parliament. Rent increases will be limited to the CPI measure of inflation plus 1%, with additional allowances where improvements have been made to the property. Shelter, meanwhile, is calling for landlords to be barred from raising rents above inflation, and establishing longer five-year tenancies. \u201cBoth have to be done at the same time to work effectively, and prevent landlords simply evicting people as a way to put rent up by more than inflation,\u201d Bibby says. \u201cThis is how much of the rest of Europe organises its rent regulation \u2013 England is an outlier.\u201d The campaign for a fair rents will continue. Meanwhile, the landscape is changing dramatically. Experts at accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predict that by 2025, 7.2 million households will be in rental accommodation, compared with 5.4 million today and just 2.3 million in 2001. \u201cIt\u2019s about time the system is made fit for purpose,\u201d says Bibby. \u201cPrivate renting is no longer just a stepping stone for young adults \u2013 it\u2019s where a quarter of families in England have to live.\u201d Despite the support for intervention, political parties have been reluctant to introduce controls. The likelihood of any being put in place under the current government is slim, say experts. \u201cI believe the government would argue that the introduction of controls would choke supply \u2013 big changes are a long way from happening,\u201d says Scanlon. John Dickie, a 48-year-old civil servant, found out at Easter that the rent on his Bermondsey studio flat will go up by 38% from November. He currently pays \u00a3765 a month and is not able to afford the increase to \u00a31,050, forcing him to move outside of London having lived in the same place for the past nine years. He says rent stabilisation to prevent such increases would be a welcome development. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to look for somewhere cheaper, so realistically \u2013 I am single and haven\u2019t had a pay rise worth the name in a few years \u2013 I am either going to be looking at moving outside London, and then having to factor in travel costs, because at the moment I walk to and from work; or I\u2019m going to have to look at sharing,\u201d he says. WHAT RENTERS SAY Londoners have been sharing their renting nightmares on social media in an attempt to highlight the issue during the mayoral elections, writes Shane Hickey. Under the #ventyourrent hashtag on Twitter, people have been revealing exactly what you get for your money in the capital. \u201c\u00a3750. Double room in Hackney. Landlord was a total bully! He would enter property without notice. He did not even bother knocking! Took me four months to get deposit back!\u201d said one. \u201cRent: \u00a3700. Location: Wapping. Landlord continues to refuse to treat mould-infested flat. I\u2019d move but I can\u2019t afford to (Also, the landlord insists we pay our rent in cash),\u201d reported another. The campaign was launched by Generation Rent in the run up to the mayoral election, which takes place on Thursday. Among the complaints were pictures of mould growing (titled \u201cFancy Decoration\u201d) and a picture of a beetle (\u201cPets included. Leyton \u00a3780\u201d). Another wrote: \u201cWalthamstow. \u00a31,150 (one-bedroom flat). Leaky mouldy sink, saggy curtain rail, people openly piss in the street.\u201d Generation Rent said renters should make their complaints heard via the ballot box this week. \u201cThe candidates for mayor describe London as the greatest city on earth, but as long as growing numbers are paying huge sums to live in squalor they\u2019ll have a lot of work to do to make that a reality. The hashtag #ventyourrent is unearthing the scale of common problems like damp and mice, all the way up to the most shocking experiences like poisoning, ceilings falling in and bullying landlords and letting agents,\u201d said policy manager Dan Wilson Craw. CONTROLS ACROSS EUROPE Most European countries have longer tenancies than the UK and give renters some degree of certainty about how much rents will rise during their lease, writes Shane Hickey. \u25a0 Germany Around 50% of householders rent privately, with standard leases offered over a lifetime. \u201cYou can live in the property until you die,\u201d says Kath Scanlon, a researcher at the London School of Economics. This compares to normal tenancy agreements lasting just six-12 months in the UK, with either the landlord or tenant able to terminate a contract after that period.\u201cAs a tenant in Germany you make a big investment,\u201d says Scanlon. \u201cIt\u2019s common for properties to come with far fewer facilities than in the UK \u2013 often, they don\u2019t have a kitchen, so you have to install your own.\u201d Before rent caps were enforced, landlords were able to set initial rents at whatever they wanted. Caps were put in place to protect new tenants and to respond to concerns about rents rising too fast amid a housing shortage. But the new system has attracted criticism from tenants\u2019 rights groups who say the burden of enforcement relies on renters, and rogue landlords aren\u2019t penalised for busting the cap. \u25a0 Sweden Rents are set through negotiations between representatives of landlords and tenants. In 2014, the rent rise for Stockholm was set at 1.12%. However, the system has experienced pressures, with a shortage of properties creating a thriving rental property black market. \u25a0 Holland The rent charged depends on the number of \u201cquality points\u201d houses rack up. \u201cThis depends on attributes including size, whether they have a garden and double-glazing \u2013 but not location,\u201d says Scanlon. \u201cThere is a maximum that can be charged depending on this, although at the top end \u2013 for properties with rents above \u20ac700 a month \u2013 they can be freely set.\u201d \u25a0 Denmark There are two control systems. \u201cThey depend on when the property was built \u2013 but both hold rents below market levels,\u201d Scanlon says. Properties built since 1991 are free of rent controls. \u201cThis was to encourage more properties to be built \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d \u25a0 France A controversial set of controls came into force in Paris in August last year. Rents must be no more than 20% above or 30% below the median rental price for the area. The rules prompted anger among property agencies and landlords, who claimed they would deter investment.",
