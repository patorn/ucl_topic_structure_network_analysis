  "body": "Hometown: Ypsilanti, Michigan.  The lineup: Daniel Wilson (vocals, instruments).  The background: Daniel Wilson was named one of Time magazine\u2019s 15 Musical Artists to Watch in 2015. Time magazine! They usually only report on political upheavals and wars (and the occasional seismic musical phenomenon). We did mention this 25-year-old Ypsilanti singer, songwriter and producer before, but there has been a substantial advance in terms of his compositional abilities, and we struggled last time to contain his excellence in a 100-blurb, so here\u2019s a 700-word one instead. Besides, that last Guardian Music cameo caught his emergence, blinking, into the light, whereas this sees the full flowering of his talent.  It would appear to be his breakthrough moment: his latest (third) EP, Sinner of the Week \u2013 the follow-up to 2014\u2019s Young Rubbish and Boy Who Cried Thunder \u2013 features studio enhancements from such production luminaries as Matt Hales (Disclosure, Lianne La Havas), Jimmy Harry (Madonna, Weezer), and Jimmy Hogarth (James Bay, Sia). Each adds lustre to what are essentially lo-fi laptop recordings made using his mother\u2019s vintage tape recorder and a bunch of budget computer software (his own, not his mum\u2019s). As a result, there is \u201chefty rotation\u201d (technical music industry jargon) on both Radio 1 and Radio 2 for the EP\u2019s lead single, Wedding Daze.        There\u2019s a good reason for that: Wedding Daze is fabulous, gleaming electronic soul with a gritty big-band sample, like the (retro-)modern equivalent of those Fairlight orchestral stabs Trevor Horn used to splash all over records by ABC and Art of Noise. There\u2019s also an attention-grabbing lyric (\u201cI\u2019m getting married, mama, if it\u2019s the last thing I\u2019ll do\u201d) delivered by a falsetto warble, and a memorable melody of the sort that could, in the nicest possible way, have enlivened any pop song of the last 50 years. Hence the interests from Radios 1 and 2: this is the kind of tune that could appeal equally to fans of Dusty In Memphis and Dev Hynes, Motown and McAlmont & Butler. With his voice, steeped in the church and (original) R&B, you can imagine the bookers at Later\u2026 drooling over Daniel Wilson, a music production autodidact who spent 10 years in a gospel choir. But there are enough \u201cindie\u201d, idiosyncratic sonic details to appease listeners who prefer their R&B stripped-down and synthetic.  Of the other tracks on the new EP, Give You Away features Wilson in quavery voice mode, like a eunuch Bryan Ferry warbling \u201cI\u2019m missing a part of you\u201d ahead of the more harshly sung chorus, \u201cI\u2019ll give you away\u201d, the latter paraphrasing the misunderstood philosopher Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner who once decreed that \u201cif you love somebody, set them free\u201d. Chasing and Ways betray Wilson\u2019s gospel roots, but it\u2019s the title track that confirms his greatness: this is an 80s-style electro-pop song with a shimmering production and melody, pure Jam & Lewis circa Saturday Love by Cherrelle. If Wedding Daze becomes Wilson\u2019s debut hit, this will surely be the one they rush out to immediately replace it in the charts. Classy and classic.  The buzz: \u201cHis voice can work equally well accompanied by simple piano or all out synthpop euphoria\u201d  The truth: Doo-doo-doo-doo, let\u2019s sing it together  Most likely to: Cause an outbreak of dancing  Least likely to: Cause a political upheaval  What to buy: His new EP, Sinner Of The Week, is released in June by Zap File next to: Dev Hynes, Kele Okereke, Tunde Adebimpe, David McAlmont  Links: https://soundcloud.com/danielwilson  Ones to watch: ArchiveX, Lecaud\u00e9, Maps & His Mothball Fleet, Golden Age, Lyra",
