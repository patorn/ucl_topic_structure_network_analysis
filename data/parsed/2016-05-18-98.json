Related: 'Brazil is not a democracy': Cannes contender's cast stage red carpet protest    News of the outside world, with all its dreary politics, is almost unbearably dull and irrelevant, and sends you into a mild panic as you realise this is the world to which you must soon return. Too little sleep, too much ros\u00e9 and too few regular meals send everyone close to the edge of madness. For me peak Cannes arrived when the trade press it was reported that Colin Firth and his wife Livia had hosted a private lunch with the super-posh watchmaker Chopard; according to the press handout the point was \u201cto celebrate the journey to sustainable luxury\u201d. To \u2026 to \u2026 what? All over town, journalists and delegates grabbed their heads and realised that they couldn\u2019t take it any more. Well, Chopard is a luxury brand \u2013 all gold and diamonds. It yearns for sustainable practices. Don\u2019t we all? I bet they were scraping the canapes off the ceiling at the end of that celebration, and Mr Firth was stretchered back to his hotel, exhausted after his sustainable \u201cjourney\u201d. Somehow I suspect that this celebration resembled the kind of super-rich corporate Cannes events that took place in the days before people cared about sustainability. Perhaps what they were trying to sustain was the luxury itself. When Harry met Rodrigo           The branding of Rodrigo Duterte \u2013 video      There can hardly be anything more worrying than a politician with an affectionately ironic \u201cnickname\u201d. The new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, is a guy who luxuriates in his own publicity \u2013 the righteous tough guy keen on whacking criminals and deriding liberal bedwetters who whinge on about due process. When mayor of Davao City he announced: \u201cYou want a taste of justice, my style? Come to Davao \u2026 and do drugs in my city. I will execute you in public.\u201d The president has been nicknamed \u201cDuterte Harry\u201d, probably by himself. But even Clint Eastwood, in his own political career as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea in California in the late 80s, was smart enough not to engage in this crass posturing \u2013 probably because he knew it would make him look like just another psychopathic gangster. Clint\u2019s great creation, Inspector Harry Callahan, is asked about his nickname and he replies: \u201cBecause I get every dirty job that comes along.\u201d There is a touch of real sorrow there, and I sense that President Duterte figures that the burdens of office entitle him to violence. And maybe also a streak of sentimental self-pity surfaces as he looks at the Dirty Harry poster pinned up on his office wall. Boo la la   Here at Cannes, the dreaded B-word has asserted itself. There are some people who love to stand up and boo, and in doing so clearly expect to be cheered and applauded for how courageously sceptical they are. This treatment was given to Olivier Assayas\u2019s crazy and brilliant film Personal Shopper, starring Kristen Stewart as a fashionista assistant who is also a medium, trying to contact her dead brother. It received a storm of booing \u2013 or rather the French form of booing, which removes the \u201cb\u201d and becomes the mass hooting of a lot of very cross owls. \u201cOoooo!\u201d they say, or perhaps it is \u201cWoooo!\u201d. It is more derisive than the \u201cBooo\u201d, more a sort of Gallic \u201cOooo, get her!\u201d. Antonioni\u2019s L\u2019Avventura, Haneke\u2019s Funny Games and Malick\u2019s The Tree Of Life have all had the hooting. For me, though, both \u201cBooo\u201d and \u201cOooo\u201d are equally tiresome.",
