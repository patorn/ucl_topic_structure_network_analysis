  "body": "The tickets to Singapore had been issued and the club\u2019s owner was waiting but Pako Ayestar\u00e1n insisted he was not going anywhere until he made a call. It was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d, he admits, but he picked up the phone and rang Gary Neville. The opener was awkward: I\u2019ve been offered your job. The reply was automatic: take it. In fact, Neville had already put in a good word. And so it is that when Valencia play Real Madrid on Sunday afternoon, it will not be Gary Neville standing on the touchline at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u but the man he had brought in to help him. Neville was sacked at the end of March, four months after taking his first managerial post. If that was expected with Valencia six points from the relegation zone, having won three of 16 league matches, few expected the former Liverpool assistant manager, who had joined his staff in mid-February on the recommendation of Jamie Carragher, to replace him. Not even Ayestar\u00e1n expected that. He says: \u201cWe even put a clause in the contract that stated that if Gary went I would go too.\u201d   Related: Madrid given another derby day as Real match Atl\u00e9tico in Champions League | Sid Lowe    Yet here he is, sheltering from the wind in the stands at Valencia\u2019s training ground, the first-team coach preparing for the final two games of the season knowing Valencia are safe but not yet knowing his own future as he looks to build a managerial career after two decades as an assistant and physical coach. It is clear England attracts. Valencia was a huge, if unexpected and uneasy opportunity, handed to him by the club\u2019s owner Peter Lim, but it is also one he may not be offered beyond the end of the season. \u201cI\u2019m proud that I refused to go until I spoke to Gary,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n says. \u201cHe gave me his blessing. He said: \u2018I\u2019ve told them you are the best man for the job\u2019. It was uncomfortable because Gary was excellent with me and he was ultra-professional \u2013 from the moment he arrived he gave everything for Valencia, even though it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d The question is simple: why not? \u201cSometimes the circumstances are not right,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n says. \u201cIt was a difficult project that started badly. The project doesn\u2019t fail in February because the coach has failed; it fails because mistakes are made from the previous May. It begins with decisions about what kind of club you want, what kind of people, what kind of coach, what kind of players. When a team is successful everyone asks: \u2018What are they doing differently?\u2019 But it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s many. And they fail it\u2019s because many things were wrong.\u201d Not just Neville, who replaced Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo at the start of December, joining a club with serious faultlines and flaws. But things did not improve under him; they got worse. And in a season in which Neville was sacked from Valencia and David Moyes was fired at Real Sociedad, British coaches have been seen as a failure here. Indeed, English football in general has. A Spaniard who worked in England with Rafael Ben\u00edtez and in Spain with Neville, a man who won the Champions League as an assistant and the Israeli league as head coach, Ayestar\u00e1n has his own analysis. When it comes to environment and \u201cfootballing cultures\u201d, he believes the differences are significant, helping to explain why Spaniards have made a greater impact in England than Britons in Spain. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about English football. It is a country that lives and breathes the game and has a powerful club culture, which we find harder in Spain. In England, they make you feel part of the club very quickly. I remember walking down Victoria Street and this gentleman crossed over and shook my hand: \u2018Thanks for coming\u2019. I thought: \u2018Bloody hell, I haven\u2019t done anything yet.\u2019 There are things that can be improved but it\u2019s a welcoming place for any professional.\u201d Once there, much can be achieved. Ayestar\u00e1n talks about shifts in diet and physical preparation, and describes Spanish coaches as \u201cmore methodical, [with] more attention to detail\u201d. \u201cWe believe we can have more input, whereas in England they give more importance to the player,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that sense, Spanish coaches are more proactive. In Spain over the last 15 years, coaches have also opted for a positional game, ball to feet, emphasis on playing between the lines. \u201cWhen the football is so different, you have to understand it. It\u2019s important to adapt but also to add. When the Spanish footballer arrives in England, he offers something that doesn\u2019t exist, which is why he\u2019s successful. I remember a coach talking about David Silva when he was at Valencia, saying: \u2018He\u2019s a good player but he has to get stronger\u2019. And I said: \u2018What do you mean stronger? He doesn\u2019t need strength: his skill is avoiding contact, he does something different\u2019.\u201d Then there is another, vital issue that is especially pertinent to Neville and Moyes. \u201cCommunication is crucial,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n says. \u201cThe biggest problem Gary had was not being able to express himself. It is not the same through a translator: you can\u2019t transmit the same passion, the same emotion. There\u2019s a coach here in Spain who\u2019s worked abroad who said: \u2018If I had another chance to go without being fluent in the language, I wouldn\u2019t take the job.\u2019 That\u2019s how important it is. You have to be able to reach the player.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s that scene [from The Damned United] where Brian Clough arrives at Brighton and he\u2019s there by the sea with Peter Taylor,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n continues, switching to English, a Clough accent. \u201cAnd Clough says: \u2018We\u2019re close to France! But we\u2019re northerners!\u2019 His point was that you have to be able to really understand people, reach them. The first thing the Jesuits did when they tried to evangelise people was wear the same robes as the peasants. If you don\u2019t reach players, it\u2019s difficult to coach them. That\u2019s crucial.\u201d Valencia is a huge, complex club where the pressure is intense and the demands enormous. Not exactly the ideal place to begin a coaching career. \u201cNo,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n agrees. \u201cBut not because of the level. I\u2019m convinced Gary had the ability, the knowledge to take an English club of Valencia\u2019s level and it would have gone better. Strategically, Valencia wasn\u2019t the best starting point but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find his feet.\u201d It did not help Neville went alone. \u201cI think that\u2019s a mistake and Gary has said as much. He realised he should have brought someone; these days coaches [usually] go with teams of three, four, five.\u201d Phil Neville was already there \u2013 he still is, but has been relegated from matchday duties now, a decision Ayestar\u00e1n justifies as being based on the need for clear instructions from the coaching staff, rather than multiple messages \u2013 but otherwise Gary had no backroom staff. That was why Ayestar\u00e1n came. When he arrived in February, it was to help out Neville. He had not intended to be an assistant again but a conversation with Carragher \u2013 who \u201clives and breathes football\u201d and a man Ayestar\u00e1n is convinced will be a coach \u2013 initiated the contact and they ended up working together. Two months and one phone call later, he has replaced him.",
