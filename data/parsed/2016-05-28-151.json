  "body": "My maple tree, about which I wrote a poem saying it would outlive me, is suddenly half dead and soon might be fully so. Yesterday, looking like a demoralised triffid, it was taken away in a van to a clinic for sick maple trees. Its chances are not great. Meanwhile, squadrons of trolls are preparing their epigrams about my presumptuous misreading of the future. Embarrassing? Totally. But having guessed wrong about my immediate death, I must be careful about forecasting the same fate for the tree. Perhaps it can be fixed. The treatment, however, will cost a few bob. I have considered writing another poem on the subject, but poems don\u2019t make much money. This fact is well known in my native Australia, where the Council for the Arts is a haven for progressive intellectuals self-tasked with the mission to redistribute the money of taxpayers, who might waste it, among creative \u201ccommunities\u201d, which are sure to. Careful provision is made for the community of poets. Since the market for poetry is so small, even the best poets would be in career trouble without the odd grant or award. I have never had much official help myself, but I got the beginnings of a free education, so have nothing to complain about. And anyway, most council grants go to institutions, not individual artists. My illustrious compatriot Les Murray pays for the groceries with his royalties. As poetry editor of Quadrant, he publishes all the serious poets in Australia, myself included. But now he, and we, find that the council has denied Quadrant its small grant. The reasons for this might well have something to do with Murray\u2019s antiquated insistence that those he publishes must show some sign of skill. This elitist criterion highlights the question of what can be done for the country\u2019s abundant supply of poets who not only have no skill at all, but sincerely think that, were they to acquire any by accident, it would inhibit the free flow of their imaginations.   Related: Clive James: \u2018I can\u2019t mock Donatella Versace, because I am no stranger to the plastic surgeon myself\u2019    But the council has thought of them by giving a huge grant to an outfit calling itself the Red Room Company, whose proclaimed mission is \u201cto make poetry a meaningful part of everyday life\u201d. One of Red Room\u2019s initiatives was billed as Toilet Doors Poetry, featuring six poets reading their work in \u201ca cubicled reading space built for the occasion\u201d. But the bit of Red Room\u2019s prospectus that caught my eye was this: to help poets, it has paid the bill for \u201ccreative opportunities\u201d not only \u201cacross Australia\u201d but \u201cbeyond our shores\u201d. Zowie! My application for an offshore grant will be on its way tomorrow, and soon my maple tree will breathe again.",
