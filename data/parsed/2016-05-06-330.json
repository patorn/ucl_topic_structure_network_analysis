  "body": "Hamza sits at a sewing machine in a gloomy warehouse in southern Turkey, where he works 12 hours a day, six days a week. The Syrian can perform most of the roles on the assembly line: he knows how to mould leather into the shape of a shoe, or attach its sole with glue. Today Hamza threads its different parts together with the machine, and his boss looks on approvingly. \u201cHe can make 400 shoes a day,\u201d says the factory manager. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man.\u201d Only he\u2019s not. Aged just 13, Hamza is in fact a child. And so are more than a third of the workers in this sweatshop. This is no anomaly. According to Unicef, more than half of Turkey\u2019s 2.7 million registered Syrian refugees are children \u2013 and nearly 80% of them are not in school. Across the wider region, Unicef estimates that half of school-age Syrians \u2013 2.8 million children \u2013 have no means of accessing education.     A small boy makes shoes in the factory.

In the southern city where Hamza lives, extensive surveys by local aid groups suggest that the city\u2019s Syrian schools have capacity for just 21,000 school-age Syrians, well under a third of the local total.   Related: Homesick, lonely, sleepless \u2013 and these are the lucky child refugees    \u201cThe other two-thirds are definitely all working,\u201d says Kais al-Dairi, director of the Syrian Relief Network, the coalition of aid groups that conducted the research. \u201cAnd of the 21,000, according to the teachers, many of them sometimes leave school early. They say: \u2018I have a job, I must support my family.\u2019\u201d With this situation replicated in hundreds of cities across the Middle East, Dairi says the harm done to vast numbers of Syrian children \u2013 some of whom have spent half a decade out of school \u2013 is by now irreversible. \u201cEven if everything stopped now and we had peace, we would just be doing damage control,\u201d says Dairi. \u201cWe have lost a generation. We are trying not to lose a second one.\u201d Hamza\u2019s life is a good example of why this is all happening. Two years ago, his father was reportedly beheaded by Isis fighters in northern Syria, so his family fled to Turkey. There, his mother works as a housekeeper for the family\u2019s elderly landlords, in exchange for a lower rent. But with Hamza\u2019s father dead, the family has no other means of earning a money. So to put food on the table, he and his younger brothers, Tarek and Hammouda, work in this local shoe factory. Their daily wage is less than $10 \u2013 lower than the retail price of every pair of shoes they make. \u201cI would love to go to school, I miss reading and writing,\u201d says Hamza. \u201cBut if I go to school, nobody is going to bring food to my home.\u201d     Shoes made in the factory. Photograph: Ahmed Deeb    At their spartan one-room home nearby, Hamza\u2019s mother nods in agreement. \u201cThey have to work,\u201d she says of her children. \u201cIf they don\u2019t work then we can\u2019t live.\u201d For researchers at Hayata Destek, a Turkish non-governmental organisation that works with Syrians, Hamza\u2019s predicament is familiar. According to their surveys of Syrians in Istanbul, 60% of Syrian families have a household income between 500 and 1,500 Turkish lira (\u00a3120-\u00a3360) a month. \u201cBut when you look at what they spend per month, it\u2019s around 1,600,\u201d says Gonca Girit McDaniel, a programme coordinator at Hayata Destek. \u201cThey\u2019re spending more than they earn, and so they have to borrow money \u2013 or let their children work.\u201d Syrian adults\u2019 wages are so low because they don\u2019t have the default right to work in Turkey, so employers can get away with paying them far below the minimum wage. New labour laws enacted in January were meant to help solve this situation \u2013 but in reality little has changed. Rather than giving Syrians the blanket right to work, the law instead only allows those with contracts to apply for work permits \u2013 but for most people this is not a realistic prospect. Most employers don\u2019t want to give out contracts. \u201cWe can\u2019t get a work permit,\u201d says Zakariah, a 37-year-old Syrian working in an Istanbul sweatshop. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. If [employers] helped us get a work permit, they\u2019d have to pay us like Turkish workers \u2013 and they would never want to do that.\u201d As a result, Zakariah still earns less than the minimum wage, which makes it impossible for him to feed his six young children without additional income. So he has reluctantly sent his eldest son, 12-year-old Sayed, to work in a separate sweatshop. \u201cI wish he could be educated,\u201d says Zakariah. \u201cIf we were in Syria, I wouldn\u2019t have let him work under any circumstances. But my salary is only 1,200 Turkish lira, and we can\u2019t survive on that.\u201d     Hamza at work. Photograph: Ahmed Deeb    Sometimes children work because it is easier for them to find jobs. Research by Hayata Destek suggests that in nearly half of Syrian families in Hatay, a city in southern Turkey with a huge Syrian population, the only breadwinner is a child. \u201cThere is a huge lack of employment for adults,\u201d explains Sezen Yalcin, a child protection programme manager for Hayata Destek. \u201cBecause adults are less vulnerable than children, employers want younger employees who they can pressure more, and who they can exploit more.\u201d   Related: First laughs since Syria: the clowns getting refugee children smiling    A lack of access to education is another indirect cause of child labour. Syrian children have the theoretical right to an education in Turkey \u2013 but the reality is sometimes different. Interviewees report months-long delays in processing their paperwork, which in turn means their children lack the identification documents necessary to enrol in school. Loopholes in the law also give Turkish headteachers the right not to admit Syrians if their presence would conceivably affect the learning of Turkish students. Last year Bouchra, a Syrian single mother in Istanbul, tried to enrol her son in a local Turkish school \u2013 but was rebuffed by the headteacher. He told Bouchra that she would need to pay the equivalent of two months\u2019 salary for a service that legally should be given to her free. Three months later, Bouchra\u2019s son was finally admitted to a new school, specially built for Syrians \u2013 but only after she had presented local officials with a list of 500 local Syrian children who were out of education. The Syrian Relief Network reports a similar problem in Gaziantep. Only a handful of Syrians are enrolled in Turkish schools. There are 42 newly built Syrian-only schools \u2013 but with an average capacity of just 500, there is still no space for more than 70,000 school-age Syrians in the city. All this will have terrifying consequences, campaigners warn. In the short term, working children are being exposed to frequent abuse. \u201cSexual harassment is very common, and so is physical abuse,\u201d says the Syrian Relief Network\u2019s Kais al-Dairi. \u201cI have interviewed kids and they say in their innocent way, \u2018this guy held my hand, this guy tried to lead me here, this guy tried to touch me here\u2019.\u201d     Children in the factory. Photograph: Ahmed Deeb    Zakariah\u2019s son reports being beaten by his sweatshop manager. \u201cThe boss beats me with a screwdriver, metal, whatever is in his hand,\u201d says Sayed. \u201cOnce he told me to turn off the radio, and then I don\u2019t know why, but he threw a bottle at me.\u201d Asked about child abuse in the city where Hamza lives, his manager agrees it is rife in other sweatshops. But he says his factory is different, all his child employees are treated with respect, and that he sometimes organises lessons for them. \u201cI\u2019m not employing these kids because I need their work,\u201d says the man, who was a civil servant before he fled Syria. \u201cInstead, I\u2019m letting them work here because they need to help their families.\u201d In the long term, campaigners fear that rocketing child labour and school dropout rates will create a frustrated, uneducated generation that has little means of playing a productive role in society, in Syria or elsewhere. At best, many may struggle to integrate \u2013 and at worst, some may turn to violence.   Related: Quarter of child refugees arriving in EU travelled without parents    \u201cA trend of particular concern is the increase in child recruitment [in the Syrian civil war],\u201d Unicef announced recently. \u201cChildren report being actively encouraged to join the war by parties to the conflict offering gifts and \u2018salaries\u2019 of up to US$400 a month.\u201d According to Dairi, at least some of these child soldiers are returning from Turkey, unable to build a life there. \u201cThis is really happening,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen tens of cases. They are very frustrated, they are humiliated every day, they have no future, so they want to go back to Syria. And the only thing they can do in Syria is hold a gun.\u201d And while this complex dynamic persists, some Syrian parents say that Europe inevitably remains an attractive option for them, regardless of recent restrictions on refugee movements. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me, it\u2019s for my children,\u201d says Zakariah. \u201cI want all my children to go to Europe so that they can go to school.\u201d Some names have been changed.
