Related: Why is the cost of hosting refugees falling on the world's poorest states?    William Lacy Swing, veteran head of the International Organisation for Migration, has spent more than five decades working across some of the world\u2019s worst troublespots but believes the scale of current challenges dwarfs anything he has grappled with before. \u201cThe system as it stands now is pretty much overpowered, overwhelmed by the demand for assistance,\u201d Swing told the Observer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound pessimistic, because I am really not, I\u2019m sure there is a way out, but I just don\u2019t see it yet. \u201cI have not known any time in my half century in this business in which we have had this many simultaneous, complex and protracted crises, of no solution right now. And a lack of engagement in the resolution of them.\u201d Speaking on the eve of the first world humanitarian summit (WHS) in Istanbul, which has been billed as a chance to end \u201cthe greatest humanitarian crisis of our lifetime\u201d, Swing described a pressing need for help across an \u201carc of instability\u201d from west Africa to Asia. The gathering in Turkey will bring together more than 5,000 people from governments, charities, businesses and international organisations such as the UN to try to create a more effective system to help those in the most desperate need. At present, victims of conflicts from Yemen and Syria to Afghanistan are in a grim race for limited funds to cover even basic needs such as food and shelter, Swing said. Adding to the pressure are natural disasters such as the earthquake in Nepal last year, and epidemics from Ebola to more recently Zika and yellow fever. \u201cWe have to do something about humanitarian financing, because the money is simply not there, because you simply find each crisis is competing with the other,\u201d he said.

In Burundi killings, abductions, torture and a failed coup attempt have sent more than a quarter of a million people flooding out of the country, often with little more than the clothes on their back, but a UN appeal to support them has so far only raised one in every $10 needed. The gathering in Istanbul aims to provide more support for groups from those refugees, to Ebola victims or Syrian exiles whose food rations were cut as aid funds shrank. But it has already been damned as a futile talking-shop by Nobel prizewinning health group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, which pulled out last week, saying they \u201cno longer have any hope that the WHS will address the weaknesses in humanitarian action and emergency response, particularly in conflict areas or epidemic situations\u201d. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has been particularly frustrated by flagrant disregard for laws meant to protect civilians, a concern echoed by Swing who said he fears \u201ca certain erosion of international moral authority, in terms of respecting international humanitarian law\u201d. Last year 75 hospitals managed or supported by the group were attacked, from Afghanistan and South Sudan to Yemen and Syria. \u201cThe summit has become a figleaf of good intentions, allowing these systematic violations, by states above all, to be ignored,\u201d M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said in a statement. Still, Swing sees some glimmer of hope in the scale of the current crisis that might perhaps force change. \u201cI do think the timing for the Istanbul summit is good, because the context is so overwhelming at the moment.\u201d     A hospital in Sierra Leone, which has been hard hit by the Ebola virus. Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images    At the heart of many problems within the current aid system are bitter arguments about who should bear the costs of supporting people who have fled these conflicts. Syria\u2019s neighbours are so overwhelmed by the millions of people who have sought refuge inside their borders that they are struggling even to feed some of them. Last week Kenya announced that it would close the world\u2019s biggest refugee camp, to protect the country\u2019s security after a string of terror attacks by al-Shabaab, and send more than 330,000 Somalis who live there back to their war-torn homeland or on to other countries. And Europe in April effectively closed its borders to people hoping to reach the continent from Turkey. Swing, whose organisation reaches tens of millions of migrants and refugees directly or indirectly each year, said those governments need more support but politicians worldwide also need to take a more constructive attitude to migration. \u201cWe keep trying to help everyone to understand it\u2019s not an issue to be solved, it\u2019s a human reality that has to be managed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are drivers of migration, both voluntary and forced migration, that do not seem to register with governments or wider populations.\u201d Even if political efforts to resolve some of the current conflicts are successful, and international groups can improve their handling of epidemics and their response to natural disasters, there is another threat looming on the horizon that will keep millions on the move. Rising sea levels recently claimed five islands in the Pacific, and as temperatures increase the world will have to grapple with how to support climate refugees. Many may just move inside their countries, but the worst affected, in low-lying island nations, will have no country left. \u201cWe are only starting to think about what to do about it. It will be a new form of statelessness, when we physically lose the state.\u201d  This article was amended on 17 May 2016 to correct the name of the head of the IOM to William Lacy Swing",
