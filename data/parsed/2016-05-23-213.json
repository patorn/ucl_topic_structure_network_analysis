When you wake up the police have been called and you find yourself being escorted back to your hotel. That\u2019s what happened to one individual in Manchester this weekend in what has been described as a case of somnambulism (AKA sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism or noctambulism). The person in question is said to have seen the funny side of their nocturnal adventures, asking for a selfie from the officers who found them. One in 50 adults are believed to suffer from episodes of sleepwalking. We want to hear from others who have experience this. What\u2019s the weirdest situation you\u2019ve found yourself in? How do you cope with sleepwalking? How does it affect your life?",
