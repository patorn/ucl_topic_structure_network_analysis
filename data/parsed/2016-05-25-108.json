  "body": "Related: 'Tom Perez has guts': US labor secretary being eyed as Clinton's running mate    Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will soon have to begin whittling down the list of potential vice-presidents. We asked you who you thought would be the best candidate for the job that is, traditionally, a heartbeat away from the Oval Office. Some 484 of you responded with choices that ranged from the wildly unlikely to the inspired. Hillary, if you\u2019re reading this, look no further \u2026 Bernie Sanders: 125 picks      You said: \u201cBecause it\u2019s the best way to lend her credibility and keep Sanders\u2019 supporters on her side.\u201d \u2013 Grayson McDaniel Richard Wolffe says: \u201cSanders draws to him millennial voters that Clinton struggles to connect with. But would they stay with him if he jumps into the VP slot? It would be hard to maintain his authenticity (and electoral value) while reversing his position on her judgment as commander-in-chief.  The tougher challenge for Clinton is whether she can stomach four or eight years of seeing her tormentor around the West Wing. It\u2019s not clear that she can play the role of Barack Obama inviting the team of rivals \u2013 or at least a socialist senator \u2013 into the inner circle. Nor is it clear that Sanders is disciplined enough to play second fiddle on the campaign trail and stick to his talking points.\u201d Kate Aronoff says: \u201cAt this point, Sanders is greater than the sum of his platforms. He\u2019s a symbol for the kind of new politics that\u2019s swaying the 51% of millennials who don\u2019t support capitalism \u2013 and many, many more.  Sanders as veep could leave his movement with a neutered champion. The office comes with little power as is. And it\u2019s doubtful Clinton would grant him anything more than a token spot.  There are plenty of reasons why Sanders shouldn\u2019t seek a third-party run, but just as many for why he shouldn\u2019t \u2013 and hopefully won\u2019t \u2013 accept any invitation from Clinton to join her as vice-president.\u201d Elizabeth Warren: 92 picks      You said: \u201cIt would bring in the young revolutionaries and unify the Democratic party\u201d \u2013 Allan Shickman Richard Wolffe says: \u201cThe non-Bernie version of Bernie Sanders, Warren can fire up the younger, better-educated rabble with her calls to rein in the big banks, and her support for a strong public sector.  Warren has proved adept at that useful veep role played so well by Nixon\u2019s number two, Spiro Agnew: the attack dog. Warren has already baited Donald Trump in the political arena known as Twitter, and could happily tie him down for months in 140 characters or less. She would also combine with Clinton to form a strong and historic all-female ticket. But she is Bernie without all the baggage. It\u2019s a fine move if the party isn\u2019t united. But if it is, why bother?\u201d Kate Aronoff says: \u201cThere\u2019s an argument to be made that a two-woman ticket could prove too much too soon for America, and tilt fence-sitting misogynists toward the Republican party.  An all-female ticket, though, could prove a boon against Trump, whose attacks on women have generally panned. But Warren is a poor VP pick for an entirely different reason: it\u2019s a waste of her talents.  A chief architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Warren has built a career on taking Wall Street to task. If she\u2019s to take any post in a Clinton White House, it should be as secretary of the treasury.\u201d Julian Castro: 28 picks      You said: \u201cThe Democratic party needs to represent the current and future population of this country. Diversity is very important!\u201d \u2013 Helen Grunewald Richard Wolffe says: \u201cFrom mayor of the great metropolis of San Antonio to housing secretary to vice-president: Castro\u2019s pick would represent a meteoric rise. But in an era when an unelected reality TV star can be a presidential nominee, maybe establishment credentials are overblown. Castro\u2019s rise would allow Democrats to reclaim some bragging rights about Latino politicians, after the Republican party promoted both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio to the final tier of presidential candidates. While he could do nothing to swing the state of Texas towards the Democrats, Castro would underscore powerfully the contrast for Latino voters. Do you want to vote for a young veep called Castro or an old president who wants to deport 11 million US residents and thinks Mexicans are rapists? He\u2019d be a great contrast to Trump, but it\u2019s unclear how he would perform under the bright lights of a presidential election.\u201d Kate Aronoff says: \u201cBoasting a thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Castro also lacks the kind of populist charisma or views that might win over Sanders voters. As housing and urban development secretary, he\u2019s been targeted (successfully) by Warren, the Working Families Party and other progressive groups over HUD\u2019s selling of delinquent mortgages to Wall Street banks.  \u201cI think a lot of the progressive movement would not be in support of a Castro ticket if he fails to make traction here,\u201d one organizer of the push against Castro told Politico. Though he has since conceded, the former part-time Texas mayor remains weak where Clinton needs him ironclad.\u201d Al Franken: 15      You said: \u201cHe\u2019s smart, liberal, progressive, really cares about his constituents, and is funny; we definitely could use some more humor right now.\u201d \u2013 Jill Spriggs Richard Wolffe says: \u201cCould a comedian-turned-senator be the perfect fit for a contest against the great orange hope? Franken has disappointed those who wanted him to fire a constant barrage of Saturday Night Live-style one-liners against Republicans in the Senate. Instead, he has proved a serious policy wonk on Sanders-style issues: going after Wall Street and strongly supporting net neutrality. Still, this is the man who penned the seminal book lampooning the conservative echo chamber: Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them. He proved his campaign chops by winning a confident re-election in 2014 in purple state Minnesota, after squeaking the narrowest of victories first time around. It might take a comedian to attack a joke nominee. But his SNL past is easy fodder for an attack ad that makes him look less than presidential.\u201d Kate Aronoff says: \u201cThis may well be the first presidential election where being an acerbic New York Jew is an asset. Occupying progressive legend Paul Wellstone\u2019s seat, Franken has an irreverent populist charm to counter Clinton\u2019s calculated stiffness.  A comedian by training and able to play to an audience, he would likely fare well in spats with Trump. And \u2013 representing Minnesota \u2013 Franken could win over supporters in the midwest states where Trump has dominated through primary season.  While hardly as progressive as Sanders or Warren, there\u2019s one key factor that would make Franken a strong left-of-center choice for VP: he might actually say yes.\u201d Cory Booker: 13      You said: \u201cHe\u2019s very socially conscious, very popular and a good age contrast with Hillary\u201d \u2013 Mary Smith Richard Wolffe says: \u201cA media darling, the New Jersey senator is relatively young and is a reminder of Clinton herself in her Senate days: with a reputation for reaching across the aisle, Booker can play nice with the Republican party while also championing liberal causes like criminal justice reform. Booker would represent a clear shot at holding on to the Obama coalition, and not just because he is one of the very few African Americans in Congress. As a former mayor of Newark, he took on the corrupt old guard and won, focusing on the city\u2019s chronic urban issues. On the other hand, he also took a lot of Wall Street campaign contributions, so he\u2019s not exactly a natural fit for Bernie bros. In some ways, he\u2019s perfectly suited to this cycle, not least in his love of social media. Yet he\u2019s not a natural attack dog, and his opposite number as Trump\u2019s veep might just be his best buddy: Chris Christie. Booker is a serious-minded contender who can appeal to the Obama coalition. But then again, Obama will be doing that himself.\u201d Kate Aronoff says: \u201cOn policy, Clinton would find an ally in Booker \u2013 and that may not be good for the rest of America. Though progressive on social issues like marriage equality, Booker is a deficit hawk with cozy ties to Wall Street.  He raked in more money there than any candidate in the 2014 election cycle, Republican or Democrat. Fittingly, the hallmark of his time as mayor was partnering with Chris Christie and big banks to privatize Newark\u2019s school district, aiming to transform it into the \u201ccharter school capital of the nation\u201d. Like Clinton, Booker is a neoliberal candidate in a progressive suit.\u201d Sherrod Brown: 10      You said: \u201cIt would be nice to have a liberal on a national ticket for a change.\u201d \u2013 Mark McGrath Richard Wolffe says: \u201cOne of the most liberal members of Congress, the Ohio senator is a male version of Elizabeth Warren: he wants to break up the big banks and restore Glass-Steagall. He opposed the Iraq war from the outset, unlike Clinton. He loves labor unions and is a strong supporter of LGBT rights. He is generally an affable, easy-going senator, but he can also be, well, intemperate. That might help in this cycle for populist rabble-rousers, but could make him tricky to work with. Among his strong declarations: he has no interest in serving as vice-president.The downside? He\u2019s 63 and does not exactly represent a new generation of Democrats. Plus there\u2019s this: if he leaves the Senate, his replacement will be selected by the Ohio governor: a Republican by the name of John Kasich. The same, of course, goes for Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, who also represent states with Republican governors. Strong appeal to Rust Belt Democrats with a Sanders-like appeal, but doesn\u2019t grow the base.\u201d Kate Aronoff says: \u201cBrown carries the kind of progressive credentials Clinton lacks. \u201cHe looks, sounds and acts like a real, as opposed to faculty club, leftist,\u201d conservative pundit George Will once warned.  Having opposed the Iraq war and the Patriot Act alike, he\u2019s won friends in labor fighting back against SB5, Ohio\u2019s Wisconsin-style right to work legislation, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Brown may not have Sanders\u2019s celebrity, but \u2013 as a white man who can go toe-to-toe with Trump on free trade in the Rust Belt \u2013 would balance the ticket in the ways Clinton\u2019s camp might hope\u201d \u2026 and the runners up Bill Clinton, Tusli Gabbard, Joe Biden and Robert Reich Richard Wolffe says: \u201cBill Clinton is Not. Going. To. Happen. Constitutional scholars generally agree (although not unanimously) that the 12th and 22nd amendments effectively stop this notion in its tracks. Vice-presidents need to be eligible to serve as president, but you can\u2019t get elected president more than twice. There are other reasons not to choose William Jefferson Clinton: the current attacks on Hillary (See: Lewinsky, Monica) are suddenly justified if she picks him to join her on the ticket. Kate Aronoff says: \u201cGabbard, an Iraq war veteran representing the country\u2019s most diverse state, made a splash this winter when she stepped down from DNC leadership so she could take sides in 2016. \u201cBernie Sanders is that candidate who will not take us \u2026 into these interventionist wars,\u201d she said. \u201cHillary Clinton \u2026 has proven that she will continue that.\u201d  It\u2019s unlikely Gabbard would accept a VP offer from Clinton. And, like all elected officials, she has her flaws. But as a stalwart on a host of progressive fronts, Gabbard would be a powerful and needed anti-interventionist voice in an otherwise hawkish White House.",
