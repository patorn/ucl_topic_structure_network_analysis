  "body": "The Institute of Public Affairs is preparing to run an aggressive public campaign against the Turnbull government\u2019s superannuation changes similar in style to its campaigns on climate change and section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. IPA executives held a meeting on Tuesday morning to plan their campaign, saying their members were furious at the raft of super reforms revealed in Scott Morrison\u2019s budget. Liberal MP Craig Kelly has told Guardian Australia voters with high super balances are concerned about the issue.

I have [a] philosophical objection to any retrospective legislation, I just think it\u2019s wrong. But I\u2019m not sure it is [retrospective].\u201d John Roskam, IPA executive director, told Guardian Australia the government\u2019s proposed super changes had become an \u201cabsolute firestorm\u201d among Coalition supporters and IPA members, and the government\u2019s claim that the changes won\u2019t be retrospective had made people \u201ceven more angry\u201d. \u201cAt every level, this is diabolical,\u201d Roskam said. \u201cWe are going to go as hard on this as we went on the Labor party and media regulation, or Tony Abbott and 18C, or climate change. \u201cIt is an absolute matter of principle about retrospective law.\u201d The Turnbull government\u2019s budget revealed plans to introduce a number of changes to super taxes and concessions. It plans to introduce a $500,000 lifetime limit on the amount of after-tax contributions someone can make to their super, which dramatically reduces the current limit of $180,000 a year. It also wants to limit the amount of superannuation from which retirees can derive tax-free income to $1.6m, meaning income generated by balances above $1.6m will be subject to tax of 15%. Morrison has said the $500,0000 limit on after-tax contributions is not retrospective because it applies from budget night and people who have already contributed more than that will not be asked to withdraw the excess from their accounts. On ABC radio in Adelaide on Tuesday the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, repeated government claims the tax treatment of balances over $1.6m was not a retrospective change because it applied to \u201cthe tax rate on future earnings\u201d. She promised the government would \u201cget feedback on any unintended consequences\u201d after it had drafted legislation but denied this amounted to back-pedalling on the policy in the face of backlash. Simon Breheny, IPA director of policy, said the government was being \u201ctoo clever by half\u201d to claim that its measures weren\u2019t retrospective. \u201cOn the $500,000 lifetime limit, they\u2019re taking contributions into account since 2007. If you take into account contributions made between 1 July 2007 and now, or before those changes were announced, that is clearly retrospective,\u201d he said. \u201cThe $1.6m limit is potentially even worse, because people have made those contributions over their working life thinking that money would be there for them in retirement. And what the government\u2019s doing here is very tricky, because they\u2019re saying \u2018no, no, no, it\u2019s not retrospective because no retirement income will be taxed\u2019.  \u201cBut they\u2019re also actually saying there was no definition of retirement income previously, and now there\u2019s a new definition of retirement income \u2013 which means up to $1.6m.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a clever political argument. \u201cI think this will be very significant. We\u2019ll keep fighting for prospective law, for the rule of law. It\u2019s a matter of principle for us. Our members are very fired up about it.\u201d The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, warned in his budget reply speech that he had \u201cvery grave concerns\u201d about the retrospective nature of the government\u2019s plans. In comments after the budget reply Shorten and the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, have warned voters hate retrospective changes and they could undermine confidence in the superannuation system. Kelly acknowledged concerns from the IPA and constituents: \u201cyeah look, naturally a few people have expressed concerns\u201d.   Related: Malcolm Turnbull's budget turns younger voters off Coalition, poll shows    \u201cIf you look at this thing in isolation, there\u2019s a reason why people are complaining \u2013 nobody likes to pay more tax. But if look at it overall, we\u2019re still borrowing $100m a day as a nation. That is completely unsustainable.\u201d Kelly backed the superannuation changes, toeing the government line that they were not retrospective because they changed the tax treatment of future income, albeit on current balances. He said Bishop\u2019s comments that unintended consequences would be examined were \u201csensible\u201d. Kelly said that a retired couple with $2m of superannuation each could expect to earn $200,000 a year, assuming a 5% return. Since they would only pay 15% tax on the earnings from the last $400,000 in their accounts, under the government\u2019s changes the couple would only pay $6,000 in tax on an income of $200,000, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an effective tax rate of 3% ... that\u2019s not an unreasonable thing to ask.\u201d",
