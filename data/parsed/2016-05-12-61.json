  "body": "Prince Charles has proposed a solution to the growing crisis of antibiotic over-use in animals and humans, telling an international gathering of scientists and government officials in London that he treats his own cows and sheep with homeopathy. In front of the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, who once told a parliamentary committee that homeopathy in humans was \u201crubbish\u201d and that she was \u201cperpetually surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS\u201d, the prince explained to delegates from 20 nations and organisations why he had turned to homeopathic remedies for animals. \u201cIt was one of the reasons I converted my farming operation to an organic \u2013 or agro-ecological \u2013 system over 30 years ago and why we have been successfully using homeopathic \u2013 yes, homeopathic \u2013 treatments for my cattle and sheep as part of a programme to reduce the use of antibiotics,\u201d he said. The prince did not give details or stay for questions, but Clarence House later said: \u201cHomeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics.\u201d The prince\u2019s belief in homeopathic medicines for humans has long been known, as well as his support for homeopathy in the NHS. It has sparked clashes with doctors and scientists who say the remedies, which involve a drop of active substance diluted in so much water that only \u201cthe memory\u201d of the substance remains, are not evidence-based. There have been some experts, however, who have conceded that homeopathy could have a placebo effect for those who believe it will help them. Cows and sheep are unlikely to experience this benefit, although a group called HAWL (Homeopathy at Wellie Level) which trains farmers in its use and is funded by the prince, said it can help animals that are stressed. \u201cIt is now well accepted that problems come at times of stress (weaning, transportation, seperation etc), and giving animals remedies at these times may well avoid disease, but it may also improve production,\u201d its website stated. It acknowledged, however, that scientific evidence for homeopathic remedies in animals is scarce.   Related: 'Black spider memos': Prince Charles lobbied over NHS homeopathy funding    There are 500 farmers trained in homeopathy and 38 homeopathic vets, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. A spokesperson for Defra said animal remedies \u201cmust be registered in accordance with the Veterinary Medicines Regulations to ensure they are safe and labelled appropriately before they can be sold in the UK. Animal owners should always discuss the best treatment option with their vet and seek their professional advice.\u201d But the British Veterinary Association, the leading representative body for vets in the UK, dismissed homeopathy out of hand. \u201cBVA cannot endorse the use of homeopathic remedies, or indeed any products making therapeutic claims, which have no proven efficacy; the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment because of the lack of therapeutic effect, which would be counterproductive to best animal health and welfare,\u201d said John Blackwell, its senior vice president. The prince\u2019s categoric condemnation of the over-use of antibiotics in farming and in humans, however, will be universally welcomed.  \u201cGiven the potentially disastrous scenario we face, I find it difficult to understand how we can continue to allow most of the antibiotics used in farming, many of which are also used in human medicine, to be administered to healthy animals,\u201d he said. \u201cWould we, I wonder, advise adding antibiotics to our own food or water on a daily basis, just in case we became ill?\u201d   Related: Antibiotic use in food fuels resistance to vital drugs \u2013 report    Davies, the chief medical officer, who has twice visited the prince\u2019s farm to admire its sustainable approach and minimal use of antibiotics, said she was delighted that he had agreed to sponsor the London meeting.  \u201cHe\u2019s an organic farmer who has cared all his life for animal welfare and he hardly uses antibiotics,\u201d she said. \u201cHis sponsorship means we have a very senior set of people here from around the world.\u201d Asked what she thought of his use of homeopathy, she answered: \u201cI\u2019m not a vet.\u201d",
