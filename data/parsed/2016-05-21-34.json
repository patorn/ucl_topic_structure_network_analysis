  "body": "We\u2019ve seen who\u2019s in the US roster for Copa Am\u00e9rica. But who is out? And what does it mean for them and for J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann\u2019s plans for 2018? Well, let\u2019s look at who didn\u2019t make it out of the provisional 40-man roster \u2013 where the two biggest surprises were the exclusions of NYC FC\u2019s Mix Diskerud and Seattle Sounders w\u00fcnderkind Jordan Morris. Diskerud has had a better start to 2016 after an underwhelming 2015 earned him the unwanted title of \u201cmost overrated\u201d player in the league, as voted on anonymously by his peers. Perhaps he falls somewhere between the utilitarian values offered by Kyle Beckerman or Perry Kitchen, and the creative X-factor of Darlington Nagbe. That\u2019s not to mention the additional overshadowing presence of Jermaine Jones, who has blindsided his way back into the picture with his forceful performances for surprise MLS leaders Colorado Rapids.   Related: USA coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann names Christian Pulisic in Copa Am\u00e9rica roster    Morris, on the other hand, might have noted the loss of Jozy Altidore to injury and assumed that, even with Christian Pulisic stealing his thunder as the next great American hope, there would now be room for him to take another step in his professional apprenticeship. Perhaps if Klinsmann was not under the degree of scrutiny he has found himself under after an abject 2015, that might have been the case. But with the relative callowness of Bobby Wood and Gyasi Zardes in the roster, the coach has gone for the experience and current domestic form of Wondolowski. So Morris will have to settle for showing his worth for Seattle while Clint Dempsey steps up for USA in the Copa. Another notable omission, who might have hoped his recent career choices would have arrested a plummeting national reputation, is Omar Gonzalez. Gonzalez left the LA Galaxy for Mexico\u2019s Pachuca in the off-season and looks to have sharpened up on his sometimes infuriating lack of focus. But the solidity of his erstwhile defensive partner during 2014 World Cup qualifying, Matt Besler, has earned the Sporting KC man a spot, while there\u2019s also no place for \u201cthe next Omar Gonzalez\u201d, Matt Miazga. He now faces the lottery of seeing what a new club coach wants to do with his fringe players at Chelsea next season. No other huge surprises in defense \u2013 Steve Birnbaum had taken his national team chances when they came, while Edgar Castillo hadn\u2019t. Ditto Geoff Cameron and John Brooks (in), and Ventura Alvarado and Kellyn Acosta (out). Acosta\u2019s time will come, but you wonder if we\u2019ve seen the last of Eric Lichaj and Tim Ream. Ream has been a perennial fringe player, who\u2019s been diligent and dogged in his English Championship career, and similarly careful and solid in his international appearances, without ever quite making a compelling case for himself. Lichaj on the other hand, just feels as if he has too many players ahead of him in the pecking order. Spare a thought perhaps for Brad Evans. The Seattle man has been the type of player who you\u2019d always imagine to be pushing for a place as a kind of Swiss Army knife option in defense, but evidently Klinsmann feels he has the coverage there. Ethan Finlay need not be too disheartened at missing out on a call-up that\u2019s still a little early for the particular trajectory he\u2019s on. Danny Williams, on the other hand, was probably a few injuries to other players away from ever making the final 23, and Alfredo Morales, likewise would have raised more eyebrows than hopes if he\u2019d parlayed his various cameos into a roster slot.    Related: Underwhelming results becoming alarmingly routine for Klinsmann's USA    Nick Rimando, who along with David Bingham of San Jose, was one of two goalkeepers to miss out. The perennial third choice behind Guzan and Howard, Rimando has had the misfortune to be a strong player in a heavily contested position at national level, and it\u2019s sad for him that he\u2019ll be missing out on a tournament farewell, even if he\u2019d have likely watched most of it from the bench. Beyond the provisional roster It\u2019s also worth looking at the some players who are in the roster for the time ever for this weekend\u2019s friendly against Puerto Rico. Paul Arriola, Amando Moreno, Fabrice Picault, Caleb Stanko, and Zack Steffen will be intriguing fringe prospects to assess over the next couple of years. They were always ineligible for the Copa, by dint of not featuring in the 40-man provisional roster, but could shape the team before the 2018 World Cup arrives.  Arriola and Moreno are different versions of \u201cthe one that got away\u201d. Both ended up in Tijuana from MLS teams \u2013 Arriola\u2019s defection from the Galaxy youth ranks actually helped institute the LA II team up in Carson, as the Galaxy belatedly realized that unless they offered credible paths to bridge youth prospects to the first team, they would lose them to their ambitious neighbors to the south. Moreno, meanwhile, was a talented but immature player when the Red Bulls got rid of him a couple of seasons back. It\u2019s to his credit that he\u2019s found a toehold in a more challenging playing environment. Whether either sees the field this weekend it\u2019s good to see them noticed. Picault (St Pauli), Stanko and Steffen (both at FC Freiburg) are all on the German-American conveyor belt that has shuffled players forward for consideration in Klinsmann\u2019s time in charge. Whether any or all of them go further than this team camp is another matter, but Stanko and Steffen will have plenty of chances to prove themselves at the highest level next year, after Freiburg\u2019s promotion to the Bundesliga. Other credible contenders never got as far as this weekend\u2019s roster or the provisional 40. Some are understandable \u2014 you could compile a compelling highlight reel of Brek Shea contributions to games, but it\u2019s harder to justify any claim that he\u2019s mastered the role of attacking full-back. But the continued absences of New York Red Bulls midfielders Dax McCarty and Sacha Kljestan from team camps, and now the Copa, suggest that the window has closed on the industry of McCarty and the intelligence and forcefulness of Kljestan. The continued presence of Mix Diskerud at the expense of the latter, is one of the abiding minor mysteries of Klinsmann\u2019s reign, though of course Diskerud too finds himself on the outside looking in after this weekend. Others have come and gone. Just as he was at the World Cup, Aron Johannsson might have been the default option to replace Altidore, were it not for the fact that Johannsson is injured himself right now. Some of these players will emerge in the wake of Copa America, some will drift permanently out of contention. But for now, every one of these players will have a summer to fret about the fact that the national spotlight is currently focused elsewhere.
