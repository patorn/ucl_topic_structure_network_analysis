  "body": "Name: Britflix. Age: Not yet. Appearance: Not yet. This has all the hallmarks of British entrepreneurial endeavour about it. I\u2019m guessing someone thought of a play on \u201cNetflix\u201d and is now casting about for a concept to retrofit to it. Oh ye of little faith! It\u2019s actually \u2026 Yes? Well, it\u2019s going to be \u2026 Yes? Umm \u2026 a sort of \u2026 I wait with bated breath. A sort of British Netflix. You don\u2019t say. Coming to a screen near you. Sometime. Probably.   Related: BBC gets green light to launch Netflix rival    \u201cBritflix and chill.\u201d Doesn\u2019t have the right ring, does it? Sounds more like people shivering on the sofa refusing to put a cardigan on because \u201cwe\u2019re halfway through May!\u201d It\u2019s just a rumoured working title. It\u2019ll be great. The government has given the go-ahead for the BBC to develop a subscription streaming service and it\u2019s going to partner with ITV and loads of others to make it happen. This is part of the push by culture secretary John Whittingdale to dismantle Auntie\u2019s current funding model and make it compete with commercial rivals, then? No, no. Yes, yes. Whittingdale says that the BBC welcomes this greater freedom to supplement the licence fee and viewers will simply revel in the chance to pay for some bits of their viewing separately. Let us, temporarily, agree to differ on this point. What will Britflix look like? It\u2019s an exciting time to speculate. NBC Universal is involved. Apparently the BBC archive will be available. And it will be able to commission its own original series. Making a Cup of Tea? Murdering a Cup of Tea? Unbreakable Kirsty Allsopp? Orange is the New Colour of Huw Edwards\u2019s Tie and I Don\u2019t Like It? NBC Universal owns Downton Abbey so there might also be \u2026 Downton Abbey. I won\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t be able to find anything on it anyway. If the US hasn\u2019t figured out a way to make the thing navigable, there\u2019s not a search button\u2019s chance in hell that we will. Scrolling through random lists of offerings ranging from possibly watchable to why-TF-are-you-recommending-this-to-me is the glue that holds 85% of modern relationships together. And the other 15%? They\u2019ve got Amazon Prime. Do say: \u201cIf it will give me a full Victoria Wood retrospective, back-to-back Alan Bleasdale and Jack Rosenthal seasons (alongside daily showings of The Monocled Mutineer and Bar Mitzvah Boy), the full Dennis Potter archive and Play School: the Brian Cant Years in constant rotation, sign me up.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cMore mindless scrolling? Is this what I\u2019m not paying my licence fee for?\u201d",
