In fact the chief reason might not be so\u00a0complex after all. The very existence of private schools in this country has been the elephant in the room of educational policy and practice for decades. Successive governments have been dazzled into believing that the solution to state schools\u2019 problems is simply to make them a bit more like private schools. Successive generations of highly skilled teachers and potentially influential parents have been absolved of all responsibility for improving the educational outcomes of the majority of British children, and the alumni of the private schools have been anointed with a hollow sense of privilege and entitlement which now seeps through the whole of our society. The boldest and most radical move we can make to build a truly inclusive and democratic education system would be to remove the charitable status of private schools, as a first step to abolishing them altogether. Only then will there be enough political will and parental engagement to make the whole system fit for purpose.Andrew ColleyHalstead, Essex \u2022 It may well have been political expediency that caused Nicky Morgan to redefine the government\u2019s totalitarian academisation mandate (Osborne\u2019s plan to force schools to turn into academies dropped, 7 May). However, the resultant \u201crattling of the chains\u201d by academy trusts, associations and alliances is betraying their \u201cprofit motive\u201d philosophy. Possibly, just possibly, Friday\u2019s decision by Morgan will give some overdue courage to headteachers, school governance and classroom teachers that united they do have the necessary political capital to create an educational, \u201clearner-centred\u201d rather than \u201cscore-centred\u201d agenda for education. Perhaps we can then support teachers and teacher-trainers in developing effective learning for life and employability, rather than the current model of coaching for short-term grading in our schools.Professor Bill BoyleTarporley, Cheshire  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
