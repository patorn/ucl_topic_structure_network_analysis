Yet this headline \u2013 and the accompanying 6,000-word article attacking debt-fuelled growth \u2013 has sparked weeks of speculation over an alleged political feud at the pinnacle of Chinese politics between the president, Xi Jinping, and the prime minister, Li Keqiang, the supposed steward of the Chinese economy. \u201cThe recent People\u2019s Daily interview \u2026 not only exposes a deep rift between [Xi and Li] \u2026 it also shows the power struggle has got so bitter that the president had to resort to the media to push his agenda,\u201d one commentator said in the South China Morning Post.    Related: Is 2016 the year when the world tumbles back into economic crisis?    \u201cClear divisions have emerged within the Chinese leadership,\u201d wrote Nikkei\u2019s Harada Issaku, claiming the two camps were \u201clocking horns\u201d over whether to prioritise economic stability or structural reforms. The 9 May article \u2013 penned by an unnamed yet supposedly \u201cauthoritative\u201d scribe \u2013 warned excessive credit growth could plunge China into financial turmoil, even wiping out the savings of the ordinary citizens.  As if to hammer that point home, a second, even longer article followed 24 hours later \u2013 this time a speech by Xi Jinping \u2013 in which the president laid out his vision for the Chinese economy and what he called supply-side structural reform.  \u201cTaken together, the articles signal that Xi has decided to take the driver\u2019s seat to steer China\u2019s economy at a time when there are intense internal debates among officials over its overall direction,\u201d Wang Xiangwei argued in the South China Morning Post. Like many observers, he described the front page interview as a \u201crepudiation\u201d of Li Keqiang-backed efforts to prop up economic growth by turning on the credit taps. China\u2019s economy stabilised in the first quarter of this year as a record 4.6 trillion yuan (\u00a3477.3bn) of credit was released, leading some to question Beijing\u2019s commitment to structural reforms.  China watchers have been left bamboozled at the mystifying way in which top-level policy making debates have played out in the pages of the party newspaper.  Some read the articles as a sign relations between Xi and Li are breaking down and predict the latter could be replaced next year by the president\u2019s current anti-corruption tsar Wang Qishan.  As evidence they point to the widespread suspicion that the first People\u2019s Daily article was the work of Liu He, a Harvard-educated economist who went to school with Xi during the 1960s and is now one of his closest advisers.  Others believe the articles suggest major policy changes are imminent or are designed to remind provincial officials that a massive new stimulus campaign \u2013 similar to that seen during the global financial crisis in 2009 \u2013 is off the menu.  \u201cThe very fact that this gets played out in the People\u2019s Daily leaves us all thinking, \u2018What is going on?\u2019\u201d said Fraser Howie, the co-author of Red Capitalism: the fragile financial foundation of China\u2019s extraordinary rise. \u201cYes, it\u2019s indicative of something \u2013 but like so much in China we are not exactly sure what it is indicative of.\u201d Bill Bishop, the publisher of Sinocism, a newsletter about China\u2019s politics and economy, admitted he was also struggling to untangle the \u201ccrazy speculation\u201d. \u201cWe all have to start exercising our atrophied Pekingology muscles to figure out what is really going on.\u201d  Bishop said one plausible scenario was that Li would be sidelined from economic affairs at next year\u2019s 19th Communist party congress and replaced by Wang Qishan in a bid to advance painful but necessary economic reforms.  \u201cFrom the perspective of reform, Wang has got a great reputation and in many ways would be much more effective within the bureaucracy. Certainly people are afraid of him.\u201d During a tour of China\u2019s northeastern rust belt this week, Xi reaffirmed his commitment to reforms. \u201cIf we hesitate in making decisions and do things halfway, we will lose this rare opportunity,\u201d he said, according to China\u2019s official news agency.  Howie said he saw the battles over economic policy less as a boxing match, in which red and blue teams traded punches, and more as a raging forest fire where police officers and fire fighters were tripping over each other as they tried different techniques to extinguish the flames of a rapidly fading economy.  \u201cThere is this mismatch of endeavours. They all understand they need to solve the problem. I just don\u2019t think they fully appreciate the coordination that is needed to solve it,\u201d the financial markets expert said.

Howie said Li could not have been thrilled about having his policies rubbished so publicly by the president\u2019s team. \u201cClearly\u2026 [Xi] is saying: \u2018What\u2019s gone before isn\u2019t working. We can\u2019t continue to do it.\u2019 This is hardly rousing support for Li Keqiang and what has gone before.\u201d But he rejected the idea that a Tony Blair-Gordon Brown-style feud was playing out between China\u2019s two most powerful men. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is that vitriolic or open or contentious,\u201d he said. Bishop said he also believed there was more consensus over the economy than many outside observers admitted.  \u201cThe idea that the leadership doesn\u2019t understand how bad the problems are and that foreign experts have a much better idea of what is going on in the Chinese system I think are hogwash. I think they are very clear how bad it is.\u201d Whatever the truth, the saga has underlined how under Xi, a centralising strongman president dubbed the \u201cChairman of Everything\u201d, China\u2019s already intensely secretive political system has become even more opaque.  \u201cThe fact that we are even speculating about this is quite remarkable because frankly nobody has any idea,\u201d said Bishop. \u201cAnd I guarantee you that most people at the top level of Chinese government probably have no idea what is going to happen.\u201d",
