I assumed this was deliberate, calculated to reassure Radio 4 listeners who took fright when the former Footballers\u2019 Wives producer was put in charge of their beloved show three years ago. Now in its 66th year, The Archers is the longest running soap opera in the world \u2013 but many among its five million fans who favour the term \u201cserial drama\u201d took a dim view of Sean O\u2019Connor\u2019s appointment. Accusations of sensationalism and \u201csexing up\u201d beleaguered his first year; one critic memorably accused him of turning The Archers into \u201cEastEnders in a field\u201d. Instead, he has transformed the show into a national conversation. Longstanding fans previously embarrassed to own up to their addiction to \u201cthe everyday tale of farming folk\u201d have been engaged in fevered debates with the newly converted, all mesmerised by a storyline based around the new criminal offence of coercive control. They have listened in horror as a hitherto tepid character, Helen Archer, fell for the deceptive charms of a suave hunting\u2019n\u2019shooting type, Rob Titchener, who proceeded to undermine, isolate, bully and control her. The story, plotted painstakingly over 900 episodes, reached its climax last month when Helen finally snapped and stabbed Rob with a kitchen knife, delivering that rare soap-opera alchemy when fiction transitions into real life. The stabbing made the front page of almost every national newspaper, while more than \u00a3100,000 has been raised for the domestic violence charity Refuge, and, in the pages of the Times, barristers have been pitching the defence case they would make for Helen. The recent announcement of O\u2019Connor\u2019s departure from The Archers this summer for EastEnders is now being lamented by many of the very listeners who had previously bombarded online forums demanding he be sacked.    'The show is successful because it uses the prism of farming to talk about Britain in all of its difficulty and glory.'    O\u2019Connor could be forgiven for saying, \u201cHa! I told you so,\u201d but if that\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking, he isn\u2019t letting on. His manner is an appealing hybrid of scholarly and luvvie, and he talks about The Archers in the literary terms of the English undergraduate he once was. On his original application form for the editor\u2019s job, he tells me, he simply \u201cignored the questions\u201d and wrote what he felt the show was really about. \u201cI said I thought it was about who we were, who we are, and where we\u2019re going. The show is so successful because it uses the prism of farming to talk about Britain in all of its difficulty and glory. In Genesis, Adam is told he\u2019s going to have to till the soil for the rest of his life, so it\u2019s a very ancient culture. But farming is also uniquely modern, because it\u2019s about European directives, or it\u2019s about drones. Ultimately, farmers live with that strange knowledge that fate invades their lives in the way that it does in Thomas Hardy. There\u2019s something more important to you, and that\u2019s the farm, and no other soap opera has the same structure. It\u2019s unique. And so every day, incrementally, you are adding another layer to a piece of ongoing social history, so it\u2019s a work of art in the making. I was trying to get across that it was more than just a programme. As real fans know, it\u2019s not just a drama.\u201d Had I not been listening to The Archers for 40 years, I might suggest this sounded a little pretentious. But if I did, O\u2019Connor says he wouldn\u2019t care. Without self-consciousness, he references A Doll\u2019s House by Ibsen, Patrick Hamilton\u2019s Gas Light, The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad, and, above all, Hardy\u2019s Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles as inspirations for the Rob and Helen storyline. One of the show\u2019s writers researched the new offence of coercive control, and together the team crafted a relationship that appeared to those around Helen to be a loving one, but which was, in private, a textbook case of the kind of abuse made illegal last year. Home Office guidelines offer a long list of examples of coercive control \u2013 humiliation, rape, denigration, threats of violence \u2013 all of which would be instantly recognisable to Archers\u2019 listeners. Realism, however, has its limits. For months, listeners had been waiting in dread for Rob\u2019s violence to escalate, so O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision to have Helen wield the knife came as a surprise. Some have complained that the denouement was absurdly unrealistic; abuse victims very seldom commit violence against the perpetrator. \u201cYes,\u201d O\u2019Connor concedes. \u201cBut if Helen was killed by Rob then there would be no story, and all we would be doing then is following a realistic plot. Ultimately, the point of the story is to really investigate her as a character, as a central Archers family member.\u201d Another criticism came from a perhaps unexpected quarter. Erin Pizzey, the founder of Britain\u2019s first women\u2019s shelter, which evolved into the charity Refuge, wrote in the Daily Mail: \u201cHelen fans have bombarded Twitter, saying Rob deserved his fate. But does anyone actually deserve to be stabbed, however badly they\u2019ve behaved?\u201d I ask O\u2019Connor if he thinks Rob deserved it, and he looks uncharacteristically uneasy.

Photograph: Pete Dadds/BBC/PA    \u201cWell, it\u2019s a very complicated question, because the issue that we\u2019re dealing with at the moment in the show is, who is the victim? The five million people who listen to the show know that Helen is the victim.\u201d Does he agree? He becomes cagily non-committal. \u201cErm, well ... She shouldn\u2019t have stabbed him, but it\u2019s interesting, the audience are very partial in their responses to the show. They jump up and down cheering when Rob\u2019s being stabbed, but, you know, she did nearly murder him and that\u2019s not right. We don\u2019t solve the issue of domestic violence by killing the perpetrator. But I would say, there was a little boy involved [Helen\u2019s five-year-old son witnessed the attack], and she believed that he was maybe in danger, and that\u2019s also self-defence if it\u2019s your child. So it is ... we believe at the moment it\u2019s going to be an act of self-defence.\u201d Is he saying that the boy was in danger? By now O\u2019Connor looks contorted with spoiler anxiety. \u201cEr ... I believe that she believed that at the time \u2013 \u2018he said\u2019,\u201d he adds, smiling, \u201c\u2018thinking about what the lawyers keep telling me\u2019. Which is fascinating. Because ultimately, you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019ve got two adults who are saying this happened or that happened, and the only witness is a five-year-old.\u201d What complicates Helen\u2019s defence, O\u2019Connor explains, is the parallel real-world uncertainty about the coercive-control legislation. He has employed a barrister who is currently drafting an entire prosecution and defence case, to assist the scriptwriters. O\u2019Connor still hasn\u2019t made up his mind what the jury\u2019s verdict will be. \u201cWe talked to lots of lawyers who said: \u2018Well, this might happen, that might happen, but we can\u2019t be clear with you because the law is changing.\u2019 Most of the lawyers said it would be so much easier if you just killed Rob. But I think that\u2019s quite a soapy way of the story ending, and what we have now is ... well, we think in dynastic terms in The Archers. And fundamentally, we\u2019ve got two children [Rob had been given parental responsibility for Helen\u2019s son during their marriage, and she is pregnant with his child] and as long as those kids are alive, Rob and Helen will be tied together. And I think it\u2019s a much more realistic dramatisation of what happens in real lives; these couples have to find a way of living around each other.\u201d And presumably no one wants to kill off radio gold? O\u2019Connor grins conspiratorially. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t. I mean, Rob is a great character.\u201d He\u2019s also the only character O\u2019Connor does not like. Among his favourites are Brian and Jennifer Aldridge, and he reveals that he\u2019s already cueing up a \u201ctitanic struggle\u201d when Brian\u2019s illegitimate 13-year-old son, Ruairi, comes of age. \u201cBrian always wanted a son, he doesn\u2019t want his wife\u2019s lovechild, who happens to be gay. Brian\u2019s Lear-like positioning of Ruairi is going to be one of the great shows of the future.\u201d He has more immediate plans for another of his favourites, Shula Hebden. My eyebrows shoot up at his affection for such a pious bore, but he chuckles knowingly. \u201cShula is the audience. She\u2019s exactly the right age. And one of my jobs, if I can try to do it, is to recalibrate Shula.\u201d He\u2019ll have his work cut out livening her up, I suggest. \u201cWell, the doctor is there for a reason,\u201d he offers archly. But, of course, he won\u2019t reveal more. \u201cReal fans\u201d won\u2019t want to know what\u2019s coming, so we will have to wait to find out what he has planned for Shula and the recently returned Dr Locke. A team of 11 writers, which O\u2019Connor calls \u201ctiny\u201d, work on the show. Each takes turns to write a week\u2019s episodes, which sounds rather like a game of consequences. \u201cIt is unlike any other show I\u2019ve ever worked on. It\u2019s very collegiate. There are no rows.\u201d Really? \u201cNo, honestly. It\u2019s extraordinarily respectful. In other meetings, in other shows, people are throwing things across the room, shouting and walking out. It doesn\u2019t happen on The Archers.\u201d Even over the Rob and Helen story, \u201cthe biggest and most intense discussion we had was about whether Helen should lose her maiden name or not\u201d. (O\u2019Connor takes the view that any man who insists on his bride taking his name is one she \u201cprobably should not marry\u201d.) O\u2019Connor, 48, is married to a man he met 16 years ago, who works in the City; the couple live in south London. O\u2019Connor has been listening to the Archers since his teens, but admits he has never lived in the countryside \u2013 although he quite fancies the idea of moving to a village in East Sussex. After growing up on the Wirral, he studied classics and English in London and worked in the theatre before joining The Archers as maternity cover in the 1990s, going on to produce EastEnders, Hollyoaks and Footballers\u2019 Wives. \u201cPeople think, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s just a slum producer that does slummy shows like Footballers\u2019 Wives.\u2019 But actually, it\u2019s just about storytelling. It is exactly the same. When I was on Footballers\u2019 Wives, I would talk to the writers about it being like the later Roman empire. So the audiences are quite different, but fundamentally, my approach to all the things I\u2019ve done has been the same, and it is to make a show that I would watch or listen to.\u201d That said, he is \u201cheartbroken\u201d to be leaving The Archers for EastEnders. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it.\u201d But after the current high drama, he acknowledges: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do a story of this magnitude again for a few years, and the show needs to return to a much gentler way of telling the stories for a while.\u201d But when he left in the 90s he always knew he would be back, and is sure he will return again. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever leave. I don\u2019t think I can leave.\u201d (As for the new job, he\u2019s not allowed to talk about it.) I wondered whether he might at least be glad to see the back of Archers\u2019 fans. The original job advert, O\u2019Connor recalls, read something along the lines of \u201c\u2018How would you like to work for five million bosses?\u2019 And that\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d Last year, for example, there was minor uproar over fans\u2019 suspicion that the writers had invented an extra bedroom in one of the farmhouses. O\u2019Connor has the air of a man still recovering from it. \u201cBut if we went online and said, \u2018No, no, no, we\u2019re right, you\u2019re wrong,\u2019 all they would do is complain about everything. So we had to sit there and say nothing, which is very frustrating, but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, because otherwise you\u2019d need another five staff in the office.\u201d But he insists he loves the fans. One told him her husband had been in a vegetative state for 13 years, but the consultant noticed that his pupils dilated when The Archers theme tune came on the radio, so she has been playing the show to him twice a day for more than a decade. \u201cWhen people say that to you, that makes up for anybody that says, \u2018Oh, there are only three bedrooms at Brookfield.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter, because you know it touches people so profoundly.\u201d He didn\u2019t wear the tweed suit to ingratiate himself with his five million bosses, he adds as he leaves. \u201cIt\u2019s just the only suit I\u2019ve got that still fits.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2016 to clarify that, in the Archers, Rob Titchener was given parental responsibility for his stepson, rather than legally adopting him.",
