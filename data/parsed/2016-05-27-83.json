Speaking to the Guardian from the Labour In For Britain campaign bus in Doncaster on Friday afternoon, the party\u2019s leader said: \u201cThe media has framed the whole debate around Tory free market [ideas] versus the views of Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. \u201cOur argument is a fairly straightforward one: tThere have been gains in the European Union on working conditions and environmental protection, but there is much more to be done and we want a reformed Europe.\u201d   Brexit explained: vote leave   Senior Labour MPs, including the former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw, are among those to have expressed concern that the Labour leader is failing to make the case for staying in the EU with sufficient passion. Asked if he thought his party\u2019s pro-European message was failing to get through, Corbyn said: \u201cWell, there are two kinds of cut-through. One is the world of the media, with TV and print, and the other is the world of social media, and on social media we have an enormous presence and an enormous following. \u201cFor example, an abbreviated version of my contribution in parliament after last week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech got 2m views on Facebook. We are getting enormous cut-through on social media and I think sometimes the national debate is framed around the political media circle that often ignores the reality of how many people get their information.\u201d Corbyn, a long-time critic of the EU who voted against Britain\u2019s continued membership of the European Economic Community in 1975, denied he was a Eurosceptic or that his historical position weakened his current argument in favour of staying in the EU.  \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed as a party on a strategy and a position. We\u2019re following that strategy and that position. I\u2019m leading the party in that and I\u2019m on this bus at the moment and a very nice bus it is too,\u201d he said.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    Asked if he thought the EU pursued an economic agenda that was too neo-liberal, Corbyn said: \u201cI think the neo-liberal pressure on [the] Maastricht [Treaty] and the Single European Act, although we\u2019re not signed up to the eurozone, is an issue. But it has to be challenged and it\u2019s not going to be easier to challenge it outside than it is to challenge it inside. Exiting won\u2019t help.\u201d   Related: Ed Miliband warns Britain could leave EU if young people don't vote    Appearing alongside the party leader at a rally in Doncaster, his predecessor, Ed Miliband, argued that Corbyn\u2019s Eurosceptic past put him in a good position to persuade Eurosceptic Labour voters. \u201cI think the very fact that he has expressed in the past some doubts about the European Union actually makes him a more compelling advocate for the remain position,\u201d said the Doncaster MP. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s had those doubts, but has decided that the right decision is to stay in, is actually where quite a lot of the country is.\u201d Miliband said Corbyn had not arrived at his current position on Europe because of pressure from the party. \u201cI think it\u2019s very interesting how the Labour party\u2019s position has changed on this over the years. In 1983 our position was to get out of the European Union and now it\u2019s hard to find, apart from a handful, Labour MPs who are in favour of getting out. Why? I think it\u2019s because we recognise that problems cross borders today.\u201d Miliband said the focus on internal Tory party feuds demonstrated the need for a separate Labour campaign. \u201cThe message can get obscured \u2026 it\u2019s really important, with events like today, that we get across that it\u2019s not just a row about the Tory party, it\u2019s a choice about the future of the country.\u201d He denied that his appearance with Corbyn was a sign that he was preparing to return to frontbench politics. \u201cThis is about me supporting the leader. I\u2019m a backbencher and I\u2019m happy getting on with being a backbencher,\u201d he said. Corbyn\u2019s trip to Doncaster came on the day after his 67th birthday. He said he celebrated the day by going for breakfast in Finsbury Park, north London, with his wife, before having cake and balloons in his office and going for dinner with his staff and family in central London.",
