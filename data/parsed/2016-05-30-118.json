In a mischievous twist on this year\u2019s theme, Reporting from the Front, the Uruguayans are encouraging visitors to forage for items from rival exhibitions, while dressed in plastic \u201cinvisibility cloaks\u201d, and bring them back. The reward is a vacuum-packed bag of soil dug from a hole in their gallery floor. All items will be taken back and exhibited in Montevideo, they say, as a way of \u201creporting back from Venice\u201d. Confused? You will be by the end of a day in the giardini. The bizarre Uruguayan swap shop sets the tone for one of the more surreal collections of national exhibitions the architecture biennale has seen for some time. Australia has built a paddling pool in the middle of its new building, as a celebration of Aussie pool culture. You can sit on a bench and listen to famous Australians whispering sweet nothings into your ear about their love of swimming. The Dutch have installed a big sandpit and palm trees in the middle of their space, bringing a desert vibe to their exhibition about UN peacekeeping missions in Africa.     Swimming lessons ... the Australian national pavilion. Photograph: Oliver Wainwright    The Serbian pavilion has been fitted with a gigantic blue half-pipe and electrical sockets, where weary biennale-goers can recharge, while the Swiss have conjured a dreamy, climbable landscape in the form of a lumpy concrete cloud-cave. At times it can all feel like a souped-up pre-school playground \u2013 and, appropriately enough, this year\u2019s biennale seems to be crawling with more toddlers than ever.    So much architecture is boring \u2013 I wanted to make a space that feels like it is exploding in all directions  Christian Kerez     As the architectural equivalent of the Eurovision song contest, the Biennale giardini is always a ragbag of the kooky and curious, with one-liner installations deployed as a way of capturing visitors\u2019 attention before assaulting them with reams of meaningless wall text and dense diagrams. This year is no exception, but there are a few stand-out gems amid the cacophony. The Belgian pavilion triumphs once again with a show celebrating architecture of the everyday, curated by Architecten De Vylder Vinck Taillieu, interior architects Doorzon, and photographer Filip Dujardin. They have rebuilt select fragments of a dozen buildings and structures in Belgium \u2013 from a pair of brick gateposts to an air-conditioning duct penetrating a door frame \u2013 revealing the care and attention given to such simple, seemingly mundane moments. The combination of these \u201csampled\u201d elements, displayed like freestanding sculptures next to Dujardin\u2019s unsettling manipulated photographs, celebrate architecture as the simple act of making, freed from the weight of thornier issues tackled elsewhere.     Gloopy ... visitors circling Incidental Space in the Swiss pavilion Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images    The Swiss pavilion also has a refreshingly narrow focus, given over to the experiments of architect Christian Kerez and his students at ETH Zurich in generating what they call \u201cincidental space\u201d. The pavilion is filled with a a gigantic white nugget of concrete that turns out to be a hollow shell you can climb inside to explore its gloopy cave-like interior. It is the result of endless tests manipulating lumps of wax, sugar and sawdust and casting them in plaster to see what weird and wonderful volumes emerge from the mould. \u201cSo much architecture has nothing to offer in terms of its spatial experience,\u201d says Kerez. \u201cSo much is boring. I wanted to make a space that feels it is exploding in all directions, forever shifting in ornament and detail.\u201d The casts were optically scanned and enlarged around 40 times, then moulds were CNC-milled from foam blocks and sprayed with concrete reinforced with glass fibres, forming a rigid shell just two centimetres thick. The resulting shape-shifting mass is beguiling, teasing your perceptions of scale and mass, solid and void, object and interior.

Germany has knocked big holes in the walls of the Nazi-era building, removing 48 tonnes of brick in a symbolic gesture of welcome. \u201cIt will be open day and night for anyone to come in, reflecting Germany\u2019s open borders,\u201d says a gallery assistant, forgetting to add the giardini locks its gates at 6pm. Austria\u2019s offering is more thoughtful, although once again it makes for a frustrating exhibition, the real meat of the project documented in an accompanying newspaper. Rather than spending money on a lavish installation, the commissioners used their budget to fund three projects in Vienna to improve migrant living conditions. The Polish pavilion nearby shines a spotlight on an equally overlooked subject \u2013 the labour conditions of the people who actually build architecture \u2013 featuring first-person footage of contractors at work and voiceovers of their experiences of exploitation. The future of living is the subject of the British pavilion, Home Economics, curated by a young trio who studied architecture but who now variously write, teach, edit, plan and regenerate. Their backgrounds are evident in the eloquent prose and provocative statements in the accompanying leaflet, but also in the fact that the physical installation doesn\u2019t quite share the power of their words. The exhibition looks at the future of the home, variously reimagined in timescales of days, months, years and decades.     Future living ... the Months room at the British Pavilion. Photograph: British Council / Cristiano Corte    The days room, by young art collective \u00c5yr, has a pair of inflatable \u201czorbs\u201d and a Wi-Fi network, for nomadic life in the smartphone bubble (geddit?). Months, by Dogma and Black Square, is a take on the boarding house, featuring a small tower with a bed above a kitchen. Years, by Julia King, suggests a house sold as a shell with no interior fittings, to cut down the house-builder\u2019s margin on what you don\u2019t need; while decades, by Hesselbrand, suggests a home of adaptable, flexible spaces, rather than predetermined functional rooms. If this all sounds familiar, it is. Wi-Fi-working spaces, temporary co-housing, shell construction and flexible interiors already exist, so it\u2019s hard to tell what point is being made here.   Related: Housing: rethinking inside the box\u2026    \u201cLife is changing,\u201d says the leaflet, which is peppered with interesting nuggets (likein 2014 the bed overtook the sofa as the most-used piece of furniture in the home); \u201cwe must design for it.\u201d But design feels like the one task the team has studiously avoided, creating minimalist room-sets that feel like a cross between a sterile Thomas Demand sculpture and a lifestyle concept store, a sense confirmed by the odd inclusion of some JW Anderson clothes in a Perspex wardrobe. My advice: read the catalogue instead; it\u2019s brimming with thoughtful ideas that simply don\u2019t come across in the show. The neighbouring Korean pavilion takes the opposite tack, with a didactic display of the urban effects Seoul\u2019s strict building codes have had on dictating the form of buildings in the city. If you ignore the acres of data and dense diagrams plastered across the walls and focus instead on the table of models, it provides a fascinating window on to the peculiar outcomes of FAR (floor area ratio) zoning codes. With specific rules about set-backs, rights to light, ceiling heights, underground floors and allowances for extra storeys if the building has voids below, Korean architects are forced to perform a \u201chigh-wire balancing act\u201d, squeezing the maximum profitable area out of this cat\u2019s cradle of restrictions. It is an elegant demonstration of some of the invisible forces shaping our cities. Let\u2019s just hope the models are well glued down. There may be a plastic sack-wearing mob on the way.
