  "body": "David Cameron is under pressure to justify Zac Goldsmith\u2019s London mayoral campaign, after the leader of Muslim Conservatives called it a disgusting and risible attempt to smear Labour\u2019s winning candidate, Sadiq Khan. Mohammed Amin, the chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum, joined other senior Tory figures in condemning the attacks on Khan by Goldsmith. In an article for ConservativeHome, Amin objected to Goldsmith\u2019s efforts to paint Khan as a \u201ccloset extremist\u201d and said the attempts to smear him had \u201cprobably increased our risks of suffering terrorism\u201d.    Related: Michael Fallon declines to confirm London is \u2018safe\u2019 under Sadiq Khan    \u201cIsis [Islamic State] are perpetually seeking to radicalise and recruit young British Muslims to their cause. At the margin, I believe there is a risk that young impressionable British Muslims who witnessed Khan being smeared in this manner will thereby be made more vulnerable to radicalisation\u201d. Amin said he voted for Goldsmith by post a week before polling day because he disliked Khan\u2019s transport policies, but he could not bring himself to campaign for the Tory candidate. \u201cI was disgusted (I considered milder words, but decided to be frank) with the tone of his campaign and his repeated and risible attempts to smear Sadiq Khan,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy wife, who has been a Conservative party member for about 10 years and attends each party conference with me, was if anything even more outraged. She could not bring herself to vote for Zac at all, and exercised her democratic right to vote for Khan. She did, however, vote Conservative for the Greater London assembly.\u201d Labour had repeatedly claimed the attacks on Khan were dog-whistle racism aimed at suggesting London was not safe in the hands of a Muslim mayor.  Cameron himself joined in with Goldsmith\u2019s attempts to link Khan to alleged Islamist extremists with whom he had shared a platform while working as a human rights lawyer.   Related: The politics of fear and division isn't dead quite yet in Sadiq Khan's London    Many Conservatives kept quiet about their concerns until after the polls closed but, as it became clear Khan was going to win by a landslide, a string of senior figures spoke out. Sayeeda Warsi, the former Tory co-chairman, said it was \u201cappalling\u201d, while Andrew Boff, the leader of the Conservatives in the London assembly, and Roger Evans, the deputy mayor to the outgoing Boris Johnson, raised concerns it could set back community relations in London. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, said it was now clear the campaign was a mistake. Michael Fallon, the Tory defence secretary, defended Goldsmith\u2019s campaign on Saturday morning, saying it was part of the \u201crough and tumble\u201d of politics. However, that is unlikely to be enough to insulate Cameron from questions about why he and Goldsmith were drawn into a campaign to paint Khan as a security risk. Speaking on the Today programme, Fallon pointedly refused to say London would be safe in the hands of Khan, simply stressing that it would be fine being run by a Conservative government alongside a Labour mayor.   Related: Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory won\u2019t end Islamophobia, but it offers hope | Homa Khaleeli    Concerns about whether Goldsmith\u2019s campaign was attempting to divide communities first arose over leaflets targeting Hindu voters suggesting that Khan would tax jewellery. As it progressed, Goldsmith repeatedly questioned Khan\u2019s judgment in associating with alleged extremists before he became an MP.  He was particularly criticised for an article in the Mail on Sunday illustrated with apicture from the 7 July 2005 bombings and headlined: \u201cAre we really going to hand the world\u2019s greatest city to a Labour party that thinks terrorists are its friends?\u201d The tactics appeared to backfire when the prime minister linked Khan to a Muslim man called Suliman Gani, claiming he supported Islamic State. Gani turned out to be a Conservative supporter who had shared platforms with leading Tories as well, and who has threatened to sue anyone repeating the claims outside the House of Commons. He is on record as supporting an Islamic state, not the terrorist group of that name. After Fallon repeated Cameron\u2019s claims on Radio 4, Gani tweeted on Saturday: \u201cI am seeking legal action against the defence secretary and would like a public retraction of his comments.\u201d           Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor",
