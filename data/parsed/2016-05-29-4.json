  "body": "\u2018Welcome to Top Gear,\u201d whispers Chris Evans, almost apologetically. He looks a little nervous. He should be \u2013 he\u2019s been given the keys of a security van with 50 million quid of BBC money in it.  And a lot of people on the road already hate him and are giving him the finger and want him to crash. Not so much because of who he is, but because of who he isn\u2019t. Here\u2019s \u201cthe new improved audience\u201d, some of who are now on a balcony. And the staff of Chris\u2019s local Indian restaurant. Is it a bit TFI Friday? (Yes.) TG Sunday.  Why are the Indians there? To represent a tonne of downforce, which is what you get from the rear spoiler on a Dodge Viper, of course. And so that Chris can get in an inevitable reference to catering. Catering, steak, biff \u2026 remember?      Sabine Schmitz, one of Top Gear\u2019s co-presenters. Photograph: Mark Yeoman/BBC Worldwide    Quick introduction to Matt LeBlanc, not enough to detect any tension \u2013 or any warmth for that matter \u2013 between them. Later they\u2019ll give each other \u201clove taps\u201d in three-wheelers, presumably to dispel the rumours, though they\u2019ll never look like they go for a drink after filming, which \u2013 love them or loathe them \u2013 was such a big part of the success of You Know Who and The Other Two.  Then to the US Naval Air Station Fallon in the Nevada desert, also known as Top Gun (Top Gear, Top Gun, I see what they\u2019re doing), where Evans tests that Dodge Viper.  He laughs at the power as he drifts around corners, there\u2019s something familiar about it, also about what he says and how he says it: \u201cIt\u2019s about as cutting edge as a rusty crossbar.\u201d    Related: Jeremy Clarkson's Amazon show to be called The Grand Tour    If it was a game of Guess Who, you\u2019d get it immediately: Evans appears to be trying to be Jeremy Clarkson, and that\u2019s not a good idea. Those uncharacteristic nerves are still there, possibly because of that anticipation, the buildup, and the 50 million quid, possibly because this kind of scripted stunt isn\u2019t suited to him \u2013 he\u2019s a chatterbox, not an actor. Sometimes it sounds like he\u2019s reading it. The stunt itself \u2013 pitting the Viper against speedy German Sabine Schmitz \u2013 in a Top Gun-style dogfight, again could have come straight from old Top Gear. Everything about it; the location, the muscle cars, the guns, the enemy (a German), the script. Quite fun though, if only to hear Fr\u00e4ulein Schmitz (mis)quote the movie, saying: \u201cYou can be any time my wing man.\u201d Very little has changed, format-wise. Minor tuning, not stripping down. Star in a Reasonably Priced Car has become two stars in a rallycross car \u2013 Gordon Ramsay and American actor Jesse Eisenberg in a Mini. (I think that a US audience may be being courted.) And Evans starts to come into his own here \u2013 chat, audiences, sofas (car seats actually, the same ones), and he does very well.     Gordon Ramsay and Jesse Eisenberg in the studio. Photograph: BBC Worldwide    To another desert, this time in Morocco, where LeBlanc is arsing about off-road in something called a Nomad. \u201cHonestly it\u2019s the most fun you can have in the car,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, the most fun you can have with your clothes on. I remember one time I was with this, er ... well two of them actually \u2026\u201d How you doin\u2019 Joey? Yeah, pretty good. It\u2019s hard not to like LeBlanc. He is an actor, relaxed, not bad at this. That wasn\u2019t you driving on to the Stig\u2019s truck at the end was it Matt?           Watch: Top Gear\u2019s The Stig: the Guardian\u2019s hard-hitting interview    It\u2019s not a disaster. It\u2019s polished, the stunts (so many of them!) are fun, the tweaks are improvements. But it is a shame there wasn\u2019t more in the way of refreshing the show itself. It\u2019s just new people doing same old same old.  The rest of the new cast we haven\u2019t seen enough \u2013 or any \u2013 of yet. M LeB should carry on being M LeB, he\u2019s quite good at it. CE needs to relax and stop trying to be JC. Both are very eager to show off their car nerd credentials, presumably to fend off some of the mob vitriol.  They \u2013 the members of the mob \u2013 won\u2019t be happy though, and won\u2019t forgive them for not being their predecessors. And the lack of format change isn\u2019t going to help that either. When something is so very closely associated with someone, or even with three people, say, it\u2019s hard \u2013 when suddenly there are other people doing it \u2013 not to feel that something is missing.  Jesus, did I just admit to missing Jeremy Clarkson, in the Guardian? No! I mean James May, honest \u2026",
