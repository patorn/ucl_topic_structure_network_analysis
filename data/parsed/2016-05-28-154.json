  "body": "Hi, welcome to Cathy\u2019s Crafts, where today I\u2019m going to show you how to make a decorative, retro-style toilet-roll concealer in less than a weekend! If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve probably got cupboards full of old dolls \u2013 well, now\u2019s the chance to upcycle them and sort out next year\u2019s Christmas presents! Imagine your friends\u2019 and family\u2019s reaction when you present them with one of these lovingly handcrafted pieces! All you\u2019ll need is a doll, with legs narrow enough to fit inside the loo-roll hole, and some scraps for the beautifully cross-stitched crinoline you\u2019re going to drape over an old sunhat and decorate with whatever trimmings take your fancy. See, I\u2019ve used rickrack and thrift-shop lace here, on red gingham, along with a scattering of sequins, for a Scarlett-O\u2019Hara-cum-shepherdess look, with a wide-brimmed hat made from a reclaimed Nespresso pod crown and takeout cup lid, and decorated with feathers and handcrafted flowers using date-expired lentils spray-painted and arranged as petals around a bead centre. I\u2019ve gone for orange, to\u00a0pick up on her sash, but it\u2019s up to you. Just express yourself! All you\u2019ll need from your craft station is a glue gun, pliers, a craft knife to customise the hat, a rotary cutter and blades, plus a sewing machine and your embroidery kit and a magnifying glass and tweezers.

Make\u00a0the frame, then sew this there, put that on that, hem, cross-stitch all over, stick this to this, carefully make 50 of those, spray, leave to dry, repeat, dye the feathers, glue this on\u00a0that, weave the wicker basket. All\u00a0you need for a finishing touch is a miniature crocheted muff, or one of the decorative crooks we made from a coffee stirrer, with ribbons to complement the bathroom. Et voil\u00e0! I can promise you, there isn\u2019t a\u00a0single person who wouldn\u2019t be delighted with one of these. Next time, I\u2019ll show you how to make a\u00a0matching bidet cover and towel-tidy, using just a discarded tyre, a\u00a0shower curtain and some preloved asbestos. Happy crafting!",
