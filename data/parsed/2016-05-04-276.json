Four-month-old Fudge, who was small enough to fit in the palm of a hand, was swooped upon by crows while outside her owner Heather Sinden\u2019s home in Melbourne\u2019s outer east on Wednesday afternoon. Sinden\u2019s daughter Melinda Pride told the Lilydale & Yarra Valley Leader that the dog spent most of its time indoors but had been let outside to urinate. Her mother had seen the crows at the Astor Court address and \u201cwas quite concerned\u201d, said Pride. \u201cThen she heard [Fudge] screaming and she was gone.\u201d    BREAKING: Woman collapses in shock as this pup snatched by a crow from backyard. #findfudge https://t.co/FNvgboFL6v pic.twitter.com/of3iehssSk\u2014 Leader Newspapers (@LeaderOnline) May 4, 2016    Sinden \u2013 who has lung cancer, and was given the puppy for companionship two months ago \u2013 \u201ccollapsed from shock\u201d, said Pride. \u201cMum was only saying a week or so ago \u2018if anything happens to this little dog I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do\u2019 ... she was very attached to the little dog.\u201d Pride was hopeful that Fudge landed safely. In an interview on local radio, she said members of the community were scouring the area for Fudge. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people walking around everywhere; it\u2019s just amazing the feedback we\u2019re getting ... people are going to parks and everything, trying to find her, but there\u2019s no sign of her at all. \u201cWe\u2019re just hoping that she may fall from the bird and land safely enough for her to be okay,\u201d Pride said. Calls for Fudge\u2019s safe return have also been made on social media, with Chihuahua Rescue Australia sharing the story on its Facebook page.

Lauren Jackson\u2019s story had a happy ending, with her chihuahua picked up by a crow while at the park \u2013 then dropped about 500 metres away. Chihuahua Rescue Australia founder and president, Natalie Brabham, said she had warned chihuahua owners about the risk, especially if they live in a rural area. \u201cThere are hawks, eagles \u2013 you hear stories in the US frequently about chihuahuas taken by wedge-tailed eagles, bald eagles, even crows.\u201d She said she had trained her own chihuahua, Valentine, to dislike birds: \u201cHe will always bark when they come on to the property. I have that fear ... we have magpies in Victoria that swoop.\u201d Brabham said that at four months old Fudge could weigh as little as 700g, and that her chances of survival depended on whether she\u2019d been dropped, and where. A \u201csmall puppy police patrol\u201d coordinated by Chihuahua Rescue Australia was in the area looking for her. \u201cHopefully we can use social media and people-power to look for her ... time is of the essence if she has been dropped and she is injured.\u201d   Related: Crows' reasoning ability rivals that of seven-year-old humans    Crows are known to be extremely intelligent and are the only non-primate species known to create tools, such as sticks and hooks which they use to get grubs from logs and branches. A study of wild New Caledonian crows by the University of Auckland two years ago found the birds to be as good at reasoning as a seven-year-old child, with some understanding of causal relationships.",
