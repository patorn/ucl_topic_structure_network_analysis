  "body": "Below is this week\u2019s playlist \u2013 picked by a reader from the comments on last week\u2019s blog. Thanks for your suggestions. Read more about the weekly format of the Readers recommend series at the end of the piece. I had no idea what was expected from me as I turned up for duty on Thursday armed only with enthusiasm and a clear weekend ahead of me. \u201cYou\u2019re to track down spies, round up 12 of the best and send them to my office by Wednesday morning,\u201d I was told.          The YouTube playlist. Click here if you prefer Spotify.    Love was a theme running through suggestions this week. Or was it just sex? It seemed pretty grubby at times, what with the \u201cAnd in a bathroom stall off the National Mall/How we kissed so sweetly/How could I refuse a favor or two/For a trist in the greenery\u201d of the Decemberists\u2019 The Bagman\u2019s Gambit. Or Aidan Moffat\u2019s seeming stalker obsession and video for Arab Strap\u2019s Love Detective.              barbryn    28 April 2016 8:36pm  The Decemberists like a spy drama.  The Bagman's Gambit involves trysts in the greenery in exchange for documents and microfilm, being purloined in Petrograd and paying off bureaucrats. Valerie Plame is about the CIA agent cynically unmasked by the Bush administration.      Even the Cadillacs\u2019 sweet-sounding doo-wop in Peek-a-Boo has a sinister ring to it: \u201cWhen ya do the thing you shouldn\u2019t do/Peek-a-Boo a-watching you\u201d. Mistrust and suspicion fill the air in Was (Not Was)\u2019s Spy in the House of Love as well. Jamo Thomas is pretty upfront about his spying activity, something that reminds me of an old drunk I used to know. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me,\u201d he had a habit of saying, \u201cI\u2019m in the Secret Police.\u201d \u201cNot so secret now, old fellah,\u201d I\u2019d return. Jamo\u2019s blown his cover too with I Spy (for the FBI), I fear:             BeltwayBandit    28 April 2016 10:57pm  Jamo Thomas - I Spy for the F.B.I Classic bit of mid 60s Soul I got an x-ray camera hidden in your houseThat sees what I can't seeAnd that man you were kissin' last nightDefinitely was not me, oh babyI spy for the FBI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S--k_QsBszo      One whose cover wasn\u2019t blown until a lot of damage had been done was Rory Gallagher\u2019s Philby, who we\u2019re told little of except that he\u2019s an alcoholic loner who seems to fit a pattern that has been repeated over the years. Another real-life spy, James Jesus Angleton, is the subject of the Fatima Mansions\u2019 Brunceling\u2019s Song: a retired CIA spymaster reduced to selling sunlamps door-to-door and ranting drunkenly at his driver, the song\u2019s narrator. Loneliness is also central to the narrative of Lori and the Chameleons\u2019 Lonely Spy. A cold, lonely snowbound existence seems to await them behind the iron curtain.  Another one on his own is the Superjesus\u2019s Secret Agent Man. But he\u2019s happy: home alone is the way he likes it. It was a nice slice of 1990s indie from Down Under that stood out for me this week. And where would spies be without their gadgets? Hidden under the dashboard Bauhaus have found the unseen mechanised eye, the Spy in the Cab. King Creosote\u2019s Spystick deals with \u201cinappropriate internetting\u201d according to Shoegazer\u2019s nomination. I\u2019ll take his word for it. I\u2019m never really sure with Kenny\u2019s lyrics.       And now I\u2019m out of here. Make like you haven\u2019t seen me, please. I\u2019m catching a Night Train to Munich in the company of one of music\u2019s greatest storytellers, Al Stewart. I can see the smoke swirling on the platform as I write, a man in a dark homburg peering over my shoulder. Just as well I\u2019m using invisible ink! New theme  The theme for next week\u2019s playlist will be announced at 8pm (UK time) on Thursday 5 May. You have until 11pm on Monday 9 May to make nominations. Next week\u2019s playlist will be compiled by a reader who posts in the comments as chippiparai. Here\u2019s a reminder of some of the guidelines for RR:  If you have a good theme idea, or if you\u2019d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions and write a blog about it, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com or add it here via GuardianWitness. There\u2019s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \u201czedded\u201d, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of \u201czedded\u201d, \u201cdonds\u201d and other strange words used by RR regulars. Many RR regulars also congregate at the \u2019Spill blog.",
