The Food and Drug Administration is due to announce by Friday whether it will approve the treatment Probuphine, which is implanted in a recovering addicts\u2019 arm.  Each day, 80 Americans die from an opioid overdose. And yet there are only three opioid abuse treatment drugs: methadone, buprenorphine and naloxone, and access to these medications is extremely limited. More than half of people who need treatment cannot access it because of a lack of providers or because they can\u2019t afford it, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.

The proposed implant is intended to minimize the risk of the treatment being resold on the black market and abused \u2013 as can happen with a pill version of opioid treatment drugs \u2013 or ingested accidentally by children who find it in their homes. But opponents are raising doubts about the scientific support for the implant, and say that addiction would be better addressed by improving access to the already-approved drug treatments. \u201cAnything that has the potential to help, has the potential to help,\u201d said Jonathan Craig Allen, a psychiatrist and and addiction treatment specialist at Hartford HealthCare. \u201cI think this is a good medication, there are a lot of positive benefits.\u201d The proposed treatment awaiting approval by the FDA would dispense a small, steady dose of buprenorphine over six months while implanted in the patient\u2019s arm. Buprenorphine treatments provide relief from the withdrawal symptoms that can come from dropping the use of an opioid outright. They are often combined with naloxone but can also be used as a solo medication..  But the rise in buprenorphine use has been met with a rise in abuse of the drug, according to state law enforcement agencies across the country. And from 2005 to 2010, emergency room visits involving buprenorphine jumped from 3,161 to 30,135 visits, according to government estimates. An FDA advisory committee voted 12-5 in favor of approving Braeburn Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Probuphine in January. But Judith Kramer, the FDA advisory committee\u2019s acting chairwoman, was one of five members of the committee to vote against the treatment\u2019s approval out of concerns about Braeburn\u2019s analysis of its product.  \u201cI just thought, what are we doing? Are we really helping?\u201d Kramer said. \u201cIt would be better to increase the number of patients with the existing product.\u201d To prescribe buprenorphine, doctors must obtain a certification, and even then, can only prescribe it to 100 patients. The Obama administration, however, has proposed that the cap be doubled to 200 patients. Most supporters of medication-assisted treatment think the ceiling should be even higher. Obama\u2019s plan also includes $11m for states to distribute naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses and is typically administered in emergencies by either a family member, paramedic or police officer. But supplies of the drug are dwindling as clinicians respond to the epidemic. Those that settle on methadone as their best treatment option must go to a clinic daily, though the other treatments can be injected monthly or obtained as a prescription that can be kept at home. And people in rural areas are much less likely to have easy access to treatment clinics or doctors who have the certifications to prescribe buprenorphine.  Dr Carl R Sullivan, a professor and director of addiction services at the West Virginia University Medical Center, said his clinic, the longest-running medication-assisted treatment center in West Virginia, currently serves about 450 people \u2013 but 538 more are on a waiting list.\u201cFor me, the tragedy is that even for people who want treatment, it\u2019s nearly impossible to get it,\u201d he said. Kramer emphasized the need to improve access to existing treatment options, while listing her considerable concerns about how Braeburn did its clinical trials, which she said were \u201cnot very rigorous\u201d.  The trial only showed that the treatment is not worse than the pill form of buprenorphine, she said. And the implant has only been tested for six months of use \u2013 it is unclear how it will affect patients after that period has passed and multiple advisory board members expressed concerns about the definition of what patient the drug is intended for.  Because Kramer, who has spent the last 30 years working in clinical trials, has no confidence in the pharmaceutical company\u2019s scientific method, she could not resolve other issues she had with the product and voted no.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do something if it\u2019s no better than we have got,\u201d said Kramer. \u201cWe need more treatment with the existing treatments.\u201d  Kramer\u2019s criticism was echoed by Tracy Rupp, director of public health policy initiatives at the National Center for Health Research, a Washington DC-based thinktank. Rupp told USA Today that the results could be skewed because some missing urine tests were counted as negative, even though people addicted to opiates often avoid urine tests. \u201cIs Probuphine effective? We still don\u2019t know because the study was poorly designed and missing data,\u201d Rupp said.  But Behshad Sheldon, executive director and CEO of Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, said the company\u2019s analysis fulfilled the FDA\u2019s desire to see that the implant delivered the correct amount of medicine and that the procedure is safe. \u201cIt [buprenorphine] has already been in millions of people, there\u2019s no doubt really about its efficacy or safety if used appropriately,\u201d Sheldon said.  She said more than 4,000 doctors have signed up on Braeburn\u2019s website to be trained in administering the drug and if it is approved, the company plans to hold 253 training sessions in 52 cities across the US for doctors hoping to prescribe the drug. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be very mindful that not everyone lives in LA and New York and that people who live in rural areas have even more needs for a product like this,\u201d Sheldon said.  Meanwhile, FDA advisory committee members, and addiction specialists who work to treat opioid addiction, emphasized that the scale of the problem needs more treatment options, even ones like Probuphine, which are only meant for already stable patients.  \u201cCertainly, I think that there\u2019s more benefit than risk at this point for this approval, and that\u2019s what really swayed me,\u201d Adam Gordon, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and member of the advisory panel who voted in favor of the drug, told the meeting.  Carol Falkowski, a former director of the Minnesota health department\u2019s alcohol and drug abuse division who now works for a private drug abuse prevention group, said in an email that while there is no \u201cmagic pill\u201d to treat addiction, every effort should be made to expand medication assisted treatment. \u201cThe more people who have access to them the better,\u201d Falkowski said.  Though local and federal governments have proposed donating millions to combat the crisis, Hartford HealthCare\u2019s Allen said he expects opioid-related death rates to increase this year and he is not confident that the opioid addiction epidemic has reached its peak. \u201cPeople are dying every day in this state from opioid-related deaths,\u201d said Allen. \u201cWe are not out of the woods.\u201d",
