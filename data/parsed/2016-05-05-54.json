  "body": "This week we want to hear about music about sinners \u2013 repentant or otherwise \u2013 taking into account song titles, lyrics or deeper meanings wither you have interpreted or musicians have spoken about.  Nominate and tell us why in the comments. You can find a list of all songs previously picked and so ineligible here. You have until 11pm on Monday 9 May to post your nomination and make your justification in the comments. A regular RR contributor (this week, chippiparai) will then select a playlist from your recommendations. If you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions \u2013 and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian \u2013 please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com, or make yourself known in the comments. Here\u2019s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:  Tell us why it\u2019s a worthy contender. Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song\u2019s words. Provide a link to the song. We prefer Muzu or YouTube, but Spotify or Soundcloud are fine. Listen to others people\u2019s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist. If you have a good theme, or if you\u2019d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com. There\u2019s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \u201czedded\u201d, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of \u201czedded\u201d (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), \u201cdonds\u201d and other strange words used by RR regulars. Many RR regulars also congregate at the \u2019Spill blog.   We\u2019d like to learn a bit more about you and what you love. Each week, alongside RR, we\u2019ll be asking you to tell us more about the songs you\u2019ve nominated through our GuardianWitness page. We want to hear the stories, see the photos \u2013 of gigs, of moments, of your record sleeves \u2013 that you associate with the songs you have nominated. You can also share your theme ideas.",
