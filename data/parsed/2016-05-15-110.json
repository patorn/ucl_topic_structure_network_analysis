  "body": "Don DeLillo\u2019s late period work, which we can date from 2001\u2019s The Body Artist, has been marked by novels that are slim, stark, conceptual, and that seem designed to provide as few of the traditional satisfactions of the form as possible. Endings are left untied, characters nameless and one-dimensional, plots thin and haphazard. After maximalist, wholehearted novels such as Libra, White Noise and Underworld, DeLillo\u2019s austere, mindful, laconic late novellas feel, like those of Philip Roth, as if they\u2019re trying to deconstruct the machinery of fiction, to back away from the world. Zero K initially seems like a break from the abstruse and impressionistic recent work. We are plunged into a vividly realised world: an underground cryonics laboratory called the Convergence, situated in a place where Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan meet, a \u201charsh geography, beyond the limits of believability or law\u201d. The narrator of nine-tenths of the novel, Jeffrey Lockhart, is the 34-year-old son of one of the Convergence\u2019s backers, Ross, who\u2019s in his 60s and a financier of fabulous wealth. Ross\u2019s second wife, Artis Martineau, was an archaeologist, but is now dying of complications from MS and has come to the Convergence to be frozen.   Related: Don DeLillo: \u2018I think of myself as the kid from the Bronx\u2019    Towards the end of the novel, Jeffrey refers to cryonics as \u201ca form of visionary art\u201d, but this also seems to me to be a good description of DeLillo\u2019s writing. He doesn\u2019t tell stories, he summons visions. The Convergence is perched at the cusp of reality, science fiction and dreamscape, and we\u2019re never sure what in the novel draws on DeLillo\u2019s extensive research into the world of cryonics (the KrioRus site outside Moscow is clearly one model for his unheimlich body warehouse), and what springs from the author\u2019s visionary imagination. DeLillo is a seer \u2013 we know this from his uncanny prediction of 9/11 in Players, his proleptic portrait of the 2009 financial crash in Cosmopolis \u2013 and Zero K again feels like a demonstration of the way a great novelist moves one or two steps ahead of the real, constructing pathways into the future. White Noise turned around the paralysing death-angst suffered by Jack and Babette Gladney. When Jack is exposed to the deadly but slow-acting Nyodene D, the abstraction of his death becomes concrete, prompting an existential crisis that propels the novel towards its violent ending. Here, it is not fear of death that appears to drive Ross and Artis in their attempt to overthrow mortality, but rather a kind of philosophical project, even a wish to construct their lives as works of radical art. \u201cYou are completely outside the narrative of what we refer to as history,\u201d one of the amorphous Convergence employees tells a group of those about to be frozen, the \u201cheralds\u201d. \u201cThere are no horizons here. We are pledged to an inwardness, a deep probing focus on who and where we are.\u201d   Related: The 100 best novels: No 98 \u2013 Underworld by Don DeLillo (1997)    The novel is sliced in two by an extraordinary passage, a chapter of luminous poetry told from Artis\u2019s post-frozen perspective. We realise that the preserved brains, liberated from their bodies, exist in a kind of Beckettian netherworld, a life, as one of the Convergence staff describes it later, \u201cin touch only with yourself\u201d. It is a horrifying picture of a conscience locked in on itself, freed from the final release of death, deprived of sensation, merely waiting. \u201cOn and on. Eyes closed. Woman\u2019s body in a pod.\u201d After this bravura performance, the novel begins to drift into more predictable territory. We join Jeffrey in New York, where he wanders into a host of DeLillo-ish careers \u2013 \u201ccross-stream pricing consultant\u201d and the like \u2013 applying for jobs he doesn\u2019t want, becoming increasingly obsessive about the locking and unlocking of doors, the turning on and off of his stove. He is haunted by a figure who seems to be praying in public, meets a woman, Emma, and her adopted son, Stak, a Ukrainian who, at 14, is learning Pashto and speaks as if he reads a lot of Don DeLillo novels. When Ross, who in the wake of Artis\u2019s not-quite-death has suffered a crise d\u2019\u00e2ge, suggests to Jeffrey that it is time for him to join his wife, and that Jeffrey should come to witness his father\u2019s freezing, it comes as a relief. At the Convergence, Jeffrey reacquaints himself with characters from his earlier visit \u2013 a monk of no fixed religion who ministers to those about to be frozen and tells obscure, suggestive stories about his early, evangelical life; a pair of twins who act as evangelists for the project, uttering bold statements about the world into which the reanimated, cyberhuman patients will emerge. As in Point Omega and Libra DeLillo uses film to convey atmosphere, to subtly play with our experience of time within the novel. These ekphrastic images are projected on screens, which descend as Jeffrey makes his way around the underground warren of the Convergence, and move from Bill Viola-ish meditation-scapes to montages of monks self-immolating, wars in which children are killed by jackbooted soldiers, women in tears. It is as if the Convergence is seeking to convince its heralds of the need to retreat from the Earth, to hibernate until they \u201cemerge in cyberhuman form into a universe that will speak to us in a very different way\u201d. This is a book that is both beautiful and profound, certainly DeLillo\u2019s best since Underworld, and will reward repeated reading. Like Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s Never Let Me Go and Atul Gawande\u2019s Being Mortal, it forces us to confront the spectre of our own mortality, to ask deep questions of our motives in wishing to prolong our span on Earth. We finish the novel with a sudden recognition of the kindness of death, the balm of a bounded life. Zero K is published by Picador (\u00a316.99).
