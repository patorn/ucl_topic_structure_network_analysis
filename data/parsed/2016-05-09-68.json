  "body": "How did Sir Philip Green manage to give away BHS, complete with a huge deficit in its pension fund, to a bunch of retailing amateurs ill-equipped to revitalise the chain of department stores? The short answer is the Pensions Regulator did not think it was its job to stop him \u2013 and, indeed, it may have been unable to do anything even if it had wanted to stick its nose in. Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, told MPs she found out about the sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions for \u00a31 in March 2015 by reading about the deal in the newspapers. This was despite the regulator having concerns about the funding of the BHS scheme as far back as 2012. \u201cYou\u2019re not much of a regulator are you,\u201d jabbed one MP. Titcomb, naturally, didn\u2019t agree, but the description was surely fair. The impression created by Monday\u2019s hearing is that the Pensions Regulator is stuffed with theoretical powers that it rarely bothers to use. Instead, it likes facilitation, engagement and flexibility \u2013 anything, in fact, to avoid throwing its weight around.  In the BHS case, this hands-off approach was doubly amazing since the warning signs were obvious in 2012 when the pension fund trustees signed off an arrangement whereby the company would take 23 years to attempt to close a deficit that then stood at \u00a3200m. That period was \u201catypical\u201d, conceded Titcomb, but no consequences followed at the time. Instead, after learning that BHS had been sold, it opened an anti-avoidance inquiry that has still not reached any conclusions. Green \u2013 probably \u2013 will still end up being roasted by the MPs, as he should be. But what we learned on Monday was frightening. It seems the Pensions Regulator\u2019s role is to wait until things go wrong and then launch a leisurely inquiry.  Princely sums at VW  Finally, somebody with a stake in Volkswagen\u2019s future has said the way the top brass in Wolfsburg pay themselves is ridiculous. The fact he is hedge fund manager Chris Hohn, who in a previous German outing found himself branded a \u201clocust\u201d by the chairman of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, may not advance the cause. Never mind. The spiky head of TCI Fund Management, who says he speaks for a 2% interest in the carmaker, is correct when he says payments of \u20ac400m (\u00a3316m) over six years to nine members of VW\u2019s management board represent \u201ccorporate excess on an epic scale\u201d. Indeed, the most striking figure in Hohn\u2019s blistering letter is the detail that VW\u2019s head of trucks made \u20ac15m in 2015 whereas the entire eight-strong executive board of Swedish lorry firm Scania, before it was absorbed into VW in 2014, received a combined \u20ac7m. Hohn argues that excessive pay for management, unlinked to clear performance targets, has \u201cencouraged aggressive management behaviour, contributing to the diesel-emission scandal\u201d. That is hard to prove definitively but is a reasonable thesis since VW\u2019s post-scandal stance on pay has been to carry on as if nothing had happened. The management board received \u20ac63m last year, only a modest reduction from 2014, and the basis for awarding bonuses was as unfathomable as ever. Hohn suspects a cosy stitch-up, going back years, in which management knew they could get away with paying themselves princely sums as long as they protected jobs and increased wages, and thus didn\u2019t upset the trade union representatives on VW\u2019s supervisory board. Again, he\u2019s probably right. Whatever the explanation, it would be a good thing if the few shareholders outside the VW\u2019s tight circle of control \u2013 the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families, the state of Lower Saxony, the Qataris and the unions \u2013 joined Hohn in making a fuss over corporate governance.  Sausage rolls on a roll It wasn\u2019t Greggs\u2019 greatest few months of recent years but a 3.7% increase in like-for-like sales was better than most of the high street is managing. The reinvention of a chain of bakeries as a food-on-the-go merchant continues apace, even if the corporate musing about the wonders of the teriyaki chicken noodles was an unnecessary adornment; one suspects the sausage rolls are not about to be replaced. Indeed, Greggs\u2019 success makes you wonder why the supermarkets, as they tried to enter this territory, didn\u2019t try to copy the cheap-and-cheeful offer. Instead, Tesco gave us Harris + Hoole, which was pitched at the \u201cartisan\u201d end of the market, complete with obligatory references to being \u201cpassionate\u201d about coffee. Greggs no-nonsense style was the one to imitate.",
