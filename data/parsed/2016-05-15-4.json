In fresh Tory divisions over the referendum, the former London mayor drew criticism from remain campaigners for saying the EU and the Nazi dictator had the same aim of political union in Europe even though they used \u201cdifferent methods\u201d. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Johnson, seen as the de facto leader of the leave campaign, said the past 2,000 years of European history had been dominated by doomed attempts to unify the continent under a single government to recreate the \u201cgolden age\u201d of the Romans.   Guardian Explained: Conservatives and Brexit   \u201cNapoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut fundamentally, what is lacking is the eternal problem, which is that there is no underlying loyalty to the idea of Europe. There is no single authority that anybody respects or understands. That is causing this massive democratic void.\u201d But some in his own party said the remarks were inappropriate. George Freeman, a science minister, said Johnson had \u201chit a new low\u201d in the EU referendum debate and the comparison with the Third Reich \u201creally is too much\u201d. Nicholas Soames, a Conservative MP and grandson of Churchill, said he had \u201cgone too far\u201d, and described Johnson as the \u201cunchallenged master of the self-inflicted wound\u201d. Sir Eric Pickles, the Conservative former communities secretary, drew a comparison between Johnson and Ken Livingstone, another former London mayor, who was suspended from Labour for suggesting Hitler supported Zionism. He said: \u201cIf the last few weeks tell us anything: it is rarely a help to mention Hitler in support of an argument by an ex-mayor of London.\u201d   Related: Boris Johnson has pressed the big red button marked \u2018Hitler\u2019. Watch out | Matthew d\u2019Ancona    Johnson is not the first to invoke the second world war in the context of the EU referendum deabate. Cameron has warned that Brexit puts peace in Europe at risk, highlighting the role the EU has had in bringing countries together after the bloodshed of 1945. Michael Heseltine, thea former Tory deputy prime minister and remain campaigner, intensified that warning on Sunday night, as he urged voters to judge the leave campaign by their \u201cfriends\u201d Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. \u201cThey are playing with fire. We have been here before. The same themes echoed through the 1920s and 1930s. Every time I hear those who proclaim the desirability of independence and national sovereignty, I shudder with the memory of 1940,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were sovereign. We were alone. Our convoys sank in the Atlantic. Our finances bled. Our overseas armies faced isolation. That was real sovereignty and we were powerless until America entered the war. Peace was hard won. Europe came together to ensure it must never happen again. \u201cEvery world friend we have knows this, warns us of the danger of forgetting it, begs us to maintain our leadership in preserving the framework of stability.\u201d Johnson had previously come under fire for suggesting that Barack Obama\u2019s \u201chalf-Kenyan\u201d heritage was behind the president\u2019s supposedly anti-British sentiment. But Johnson\u2019s position was backed by a number of Tory grandees campaigning for Brexit, including Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, and Chris Grayling, the leader of the Commons.    Related: German readers say Johnson's EU-Hitler comments are just 'British hysteria'    Defending Johnson\u2019s use of \u201chistorical parallels\u201d, Duncan Smith said: \u201cHe talked about this nonsensical idea of trying to drive these different countries [together]. It\u2019s a historical fact of life that if you go through Napoleon, Hitler, everyone else \u2026 I think the whole process of trying to drive Europe together by force or by bureaucracy ultimately makes problems.\u201d The Conservative former chancellor Norman Lamont also came to Johnson\u2019s defence, saying it was a \u201cfact there were fascist theorists who believed very strongly in a united Europe\u201d.  Lord Lamont said the headline for Johnson\u2019s comments was misleading, telling Murnaghan on Sky News: \u201cI don\u2019t think [Johnson] was saying people who favour the European Union were comparable to Nazis. \u201cHe was simply saying that, historically, from the Romans, Charlemagne, Napoleon, there have been all sorts of attempts to dominate Europe and these have all floundered because Europe is not naturally one entity.\u201d Sources in Vote Leave, the official campaign group for exiting the EU, also claimed his comments had been taken out of context, saying it was \u201cquite clear he was providing an analysis that consolidation of power in Europe has failed throughout history\u201d.  Others said resorting to a comparison with Hitler suggested the out campaign was struggling. Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \u201cLeave campaigners have lost the economic argument and now they are losing their moral compass. \u201cAfter the horror of the second world war, the EU helped to bring an end to centuries of conflict in Europe, and for Boris Johnson to make this comparison is both offensive and desperate.\u201d   Related: Boris, the EU and Hitler: bad taste, bad judgment | Michael White    The former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper, a member of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, accused Johnson of playing a \u201cnasty, nasty game\u201d.  \u201cThe more he flails around with this kind of hysterical claim, the more he exposes his shameful lack of judgement, his willingness to play the most divisive cynical politics and the emptiness of his arguments,\u201d she said.  Lord Bramall, a former chief of the defence staff, who took part in the Normandy landings, said: \u201cI know only too well, this comparison of the EU and Nazi Germany is absurd. Hitler\u2019s main aim was to create an empire in the east and violently subjugate Europeans. Any connection between that and the EU is simply laughable.\u201d  Johnson made the comments in a newspaper interview after touring the south-west on a Vote Leave battlebus. Vote Leave will try to turn the debate to the economy on Monday as its UK tour continues, releasing research that the group said shows the single market is failing British exporters. It claimed that Eurostat figures show that over the past decade the value of British exports of goods to the EU has fallen by 18.15% \u2013 a worse performance than every member state other than Luxembourg. Despite the uproar among remain campaigners about Johnson\u2019s remarks, speculation is growing that he will make a move for the Tory leadership if Cameron resigns in the event of a British exit from the EU or narrow remain vote. On Sunday the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, backed Johnson to succeed Cameron if this happens, describing himself as a \u201cBoris fan\u201d and comparing him to the former US president Ronald Reagan.    Related: Brexiters maintain stubborn mood in face of chilling EU warnings    Cameron has always insisted that he will carry on regardless of the result, but many MPs believe he will have no choice but to resign if the country rejects his call to remain or only narrowly votes to stay.  In comments clearly designed to stoke tensions within the Conservative party over the referendum, Farage said he could even envisage a situation in which he would work for Johnson in government. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Farage rejected suggestions that Johnson would not be serious enough to be prime minister if Cameron were forced to stand down. \u201cBoris goes on surprising people. They say he can\u2019t do this, he\u2019s a joker \u2013 it\u2019s like Ronnie Reagan. Could he do it? Yes. If you\u2019d asked me six months ago, I\u2019d have said no, but I\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d he said. Asked if he would like to work for Johnson if there were a vote to leave the EU, Farage said: \u201cI love Boris, respect him, admire him; I\u2019m a Boris fan. Could I work for him? Yes. Could I see a scenario if he was PM and he asked me to do something? I wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\u201d",
