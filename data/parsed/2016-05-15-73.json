  "body": "This match was illuminated by two brilliant goals, first by Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and then by Jordon Ibe, but the brightest points for Liverpool were the returns from injury of Jordan Henderson and Danny Ings. The draw meant J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team finished eighth in the Premier League but their season will end in glory \u2013 and qualification for next season\u2019s Champions League \u2013 if they beat Sevilla in Wednesday\u2019s Europa League final. Henderson, who had been out of action with knee trouble since early April, is now in contention to feature in that game, and most of the players in line to start in Basel spent Sunday training at Melwood while a largely second-string held their own in a keenly contested conclusion to the domestic campaign at The Hawthorns. Divock Origi also trained at Melwood as he continues his recovery from an ankle injury but seems unlikely to be fit enough to feature on Wednesday.

You cannot change this. If the situation is that [if] I come here with those players everybody thinks I\u2019m silly, and if I don\u2019t come here with those players everybody thinks I did not do the right job, then obviously it\u2019s not possible for me to do the right thing.\u201d The German was pleased that Henderson and Ings showed no ill-effects of the knee injuries that had kept them out of action \u2013 for five weeks in the case of the captain, for 224 days in the case of Ings. Klopp suggested that fielding the striker was \u201cabout giving this really nice lad something before the break, being able to say: \u2018I am back and able to play football again,\u2019\u201d whereas Henderson could play on Wednesday. \u201cI haven\u2019t made a decision yet about the lineup for Wednesday but it\u2019s nice to have the option,\u201d he said. After a well-judged tribute by Albion to the victims of the Hillsborough tragedy, sporting hostilities at The Hawthorns got under way, and with slightly less ruggedness than when the sides met at Anfield in mid-season, when Klopp was angered by Albion\u2019s approach. Tony Pulis\u2019s side had no intention of making things easy for the visitors here but it was magic rather than muscle that inflicted the first wound on Liverpool in the 13th minute. Jonathan Leko, a 17-year-old with thrilling dribbling skills, seized on a slack ball by Joe Allen before skedaddling past three defenders and flipping a clever pass through to Rond\u00f3n. The Venezuelan smashed a low 10-yard shot in at the near post. The drive was ferociously struck but Adam Bogdan, making his first appearance since January, might have done better.

The winger made Jonny Evans seem oafish as he feinted his way past him on the right and then glided 20 yards forward before racing into the box, past Jonas Olsson, and firing into the net despite an attempted block by Craig Dawson. If you are going to wait until the final game of the season to score your first Premier League goal, best make it a beauty. Liverpool, Ibe included, offered little by way of attacking threat thereafter even if they retained possession quite well for the remainder of the first half. Albion refocused during the break and almost regained the lead soon afterwards, Rond\u00f3n darting between Christian Benteke and Allen to head a free-kick by Craig Gardner against the post and then skew the rebound over the bar from a tight angle. Rond\u00f3n went close again in the 61st minute after another fine run by Leko, who offloaded for Dawson to fizz a cross from the right into the near post. Rond\u00f3n got to it first but glanced his header wide. Four minutes later the Venezuelan was presented with yet another chance but miskicked when left free at the back post. He shanked his second effort wide. Lamenting his side\u2019s failure to win here and ignoring grumbles about the dull style of his team throughout most of the campaign, Pulis declared this a triumphant season for Albion. \u201cYou can\u2019t become blase because you just have to look at the teams that have gone down this year and look at what we have done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be the only West Midlands club in the Premier League next year and that\u2019s the first time in 138 years, so I think that\u2019s something to be proud of.\u201d Man of match Craig Gardner (West Bromwich Albion)",
