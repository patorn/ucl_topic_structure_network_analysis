  "body": "The question was phrased gently enough but Diego Simeone could feel the dig. It was put to the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid manager that Pep Guardiola, his vanquished Bayern Munich counterpart, had said there had been contrasting styles at play during the Champions League semi-final; different footballing cultures. Guardiola had just highlighted how Bayern had played to win in Tuesday\u2019s second leg with their trademark front-foot football, and against \u201cvery defensive\u201d opponents but, despite doing so 2-1 on the night at the Allianz Arena, it was not enough to avoid an away-goals exit. Guardiola did say that Atl\u00e9tico had played well and deserved to go through, while he talked of the pride he had in his players and the essential purity of their game. It was simply one of those occasions when the margins went against him and Bayern. It was football.   Related: Diego Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u2013 a tale of heart, guts and togetherness | Jacob Steinberg    So, what did Simeone think? Did he feel the same about the culture clash? \u201cI don\u2019t understand your question,\u201d Simeone replied. \u201cIs this about a short passing game or what? What is your question? What are you trying to get at?\u201d Simeone knew perfectly well but the question was repackaged for him. \u201cWe tried to play with the characteristics that we have, with the players that we have available to us and I think that we have now played against two of the best three teams in Europe,\u201d he said, referencing the quarter-final victory over Barcelona that had set up the Bayern tie. \u201cWe have knocked them both out and we have got through to the final. That does show that we have really given good performances, especially at home. In Barcelona and in Munich, we had to suffer but we could react to that and I\u2019m very proud about that.\u201d Simeone was pugnacious to the last. And so were his players. He and they had suffered, particularly after Fernando Torres\u2019s penalty miss in the 85th minute that could have soothed their nerves. Instead, Simeone appeared close to meltdown during the five added minutes, although it is easy to see this as his default touchline setting. Atl\u00e9tico always suffer. Their matches are often tight. But few teams know how to cope with the tension of a slender advantage better than them. And although Bayern hogged the ball and the statistics showed that they had 35 attempts on goal, 12 of them on target, the reality was that there were precious few moments in the second half when they blew big chances. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s progress was testament to the streetwise qualities that Simeone has instilled, to how this team is more than the sum of its parts. Moreover, the manner in which he has instilled a freshness has been impressive. New players have been integrated, including exciting young ones, but they have bought wholesale into the basic tenets of Simeone\u2019s style \u2013 the drive and intensity that have underpinned his glorious four-and-a-half year tenure. It is remarkable to think that from the 18-man matchday squad for the Champions League semi-final, second leg against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in 2014, which Atl\u00e9tico won 3-1 to advance to the final, there were only four survivors for the Bayern tie on Tuesday. It would have been five but Tiago is out injured while Gabi, the captain, was unavailable at Chelsea. The quartet were the defenders Diego God\u00edn, Juanfran and Filipe Lu\u00eds, and the midfielder, Koke. Gone are Thibaut Courtois, Arda Turan, Diego Costa, Toby Alderweireld, Diego and David Villa. Simeone has introduced and created new stars such as the goalkeeper Jan Oblak, the centre-half Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez, the wingers Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez and Yannick Carrasco, and the striker Antoine Griezmann, who is the veteran of the bunch at 25. The others are 23 or under. Renewal has been a principle theme of the Atl\u00e9tico story. \u201cWhat has changed since that Chelsea semi-final is that we\u2019ve got a lot of new players,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cI would say it\u2019s about 10 new players. We had more experience back then. We had Costa, [Jos\u00e9] Sosa \u2013 players who were 28, 29 years old. Now, we have a lot of young players who have learned and really improved. Sa\u00fal, for example, has shown what he can do and that is something that makes me very proud. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard in the last four and a half years and we have improved as a team. It\u2019s not just a coincidence that we\u2019re doing so well. It just shows the ambition of the club. We have a lot of players who are really behind us. Juanfran, Koke, Filipe Lu\u00eds, Fernando [Torres], Griezmann \u2013 players who have really played well and have adapted well to this team. It\u2019s fantastic to see this. The truth is that we love the way we play.\u201d The victory over Chelsea was a decisive point in Simeone\u2019s growth and that of the club. Even though he had already won the Europa League, the European Super Cup [in which Atl\u00e9tico hammered Chelsea 4-1, with that hat-trick from Radamel Falcao] and the Copa del Rey, the step into the final of Europe\u2019s elite competition brought further confidence. A few weeks later, God\u00edn\u2019s equaliser at Barcelona would bring them the last-day point they needed to win La Liga. They almost won the Champions League final, too, with only the stoppage-time equaliser from Real\u2019s Sergio Ramos denying them. Real would win 4-1 in extra time. Atl\u00e9tico now have another shot at their first European Cup. The success in the second leg against Bayern offered the latest illustration of Simeone\u2019s tactical intelligence, his ability decisively to alter the flow of a game. Bayern had controlled the first half and they might have been further in front than 1-0. Simeone brought on Carrasco at half-time and he switched from 4-4-2 to 4-5-1, with Griezmann moved from striker to right winger and Carrasco on the left. Atl\u00e9tico began to get up the pitch with more assurance and when Griezmann streaked away for his one on one with Manuel Neuer in the 54th minute, the greatest compliment you could pay him was that you knew he would score. It was the Frenchman\u2019s 31st goal of the season in all competitions. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cThe way that we performed, also in the last minutes \u2013 it\u2019s just unbelievable. It was great to see how my team played with such intensity. We had a good chat at half-time, we discussed what we wanted to achieve and we won the game. We were really good defensively and we have seen that we\u2019re a very strong team.\u201d As in 2013-14, La Liga is coming down to the wire for Atl\u00e9tico; they are level on points with the leaders, Barcelona, with two matches to play. Two seasons ago, they had to play the Champions League final against Real seven days after the title decider at Barcelona. This time, there will be a two-week period between the end of the league season and the showpiece European final. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s remaining games are against Levante (away) and Celta Vigo (home). Simeone senses opportunity. \u201cThere is another possibility for us to win the Champions League final,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last time, we had to play against Barcelona and then Real Madrid but now, we\u2019ve got a fortnight to prepare for the final. Of course, I\u2019m very, very happy and I don\u2019t think about avenging. These are new possibilities.\u201d",
