  "body": "Eric Cantona turned 50 on Tuesday and is still doing what he has always done best: playing the part of Eric Cantona to a T. For Manchester United fans still digesting the end of the soured Louis van Gaal era and the imminent arrival of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, he has a simple diagnosis of what has gone wrong. \u201cThey miss me,\u201d Cantona says, playful but serious at the same time. \u201cI think they have lost something. You can feel it. But it\u2019s difficult to come after someone who has been at the club 25 years. Even if you are a great manager, the fans still feel the philosophy of Ferguson.\u201d   Related: Eric Cantona believes Didier Deschamps may have left out France players on racial grounds    But while Van Gaal\u2019s departure after two disappointing seasons was finally confirmed on Monday night his successor does not fill one of the club\u2019s most celebrated former players with optimism, either. \u201cI love Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, but in terms of the type of football he plays I don\u2019t think he is Manchester United,\u201d Cantona says. \u201cI love his personality, I love the passion he has for the game, his humour. He is very intelligent, he demands 100% of his players. And of course he wins things. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the type of football that the fans of Manchester United will love, even if they win. He can win with Manchester United. But do they expect that type of football, even if they win? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Cantona, back on the small screen this summer as the face of ITV\u2019s marketing campaign for its sports coverage, believes Mourinho\u2019s once and future nemesis would have been a much better fit. \u201cGuardiola was the one to take. He is the spiritual son of Johan Cruyff,\u201d he says, praising the late Dutch master for having overseen \u201ctwo revolutions\u201d \u2013 one as a player at Ajax and another as a coach at Barcelona. \u201cI would have loved to have seen Guardiola in Manchester [United]. He is the only one to change Manchester. He is in Manchester, but at the wrong one.\u201d It is 19 years since Cantona delivered one more shock to a football world electrified by his presence, by announcing his retirement from the game at just 30. Which means it must be two decades since he willed Manchester United to the 1995-96 double, his goals reeling in Kevin Keegan\u2019s Newcastle entertainers and weaving him ever more tightly into the mythology that is now relentlessly sold back to the club\u2019s global fanbase.           Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?    This month Cantona returned to Old Trafford for their draw with Leicester City. And needless to say, his name was sung more lustily than ever. Looking relaxed and trim over a glass of red (of course) in a favoured hotel bar on the narrow streets of his recently adopted Lisbon home, he talks convincingly of his eternal bond with Manchester, its people and its culture. The mercurial Frenchman has carved out a career as an itinerant documentary maker, actor and artist since leaving football behind. Yet he says he would be open to an unlikely return to Old Trafford \u2013 but only as manager. \u201cI do many things and I\u2019m very happy. But if they asked me to become the manager of Manchester United, I would. Because Guardiola is in Manchester City and they want someone to win things with wonderful football? It\u2019s me,\u201d he says. Ask him if he is serious and the smile returns: \u201cYes, I\u2019m serious. I say that just because it\u2019s like when you are in the pub or the club. When you say you don\u2019t care, all the girls want you. Maybe if I say I don\u2019t care about that job, they will ask me. If they asked me I\u2019d work very hard, of course.\u201d He has now been out of professional football for longer than he was an uneasy, unbelievably gifted part of it. But his feeling that he quit at the right time has never wavered. Regret remains a four\u2011letter word in the Cantona lexicon. \u201cWhen I was around 20 years old I gave an interview in France in which I said I was very passionate about the game and that when I lost that passion I would retire,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course, no one believed it. When I felt I lost the passion, I retired. I didn\u2019t regret it.\u201d Not that it was easy. \u201cWhen you stop playing football it\u2019s very difficult. Football is like a drug. Sport is like a drug. Physiologically, it\u2019s like your drug. And you need it. You need something,\u201d he says, carefully, pointedly. \u201cI think a lot of players have depression after football because they miss something. But it helped me a lot to live in my imagination. If I don\u2019t have this opportunity, I die.\u201d     Cantona controls the ball against Liverpool in the 1996 FA Cup final at Wembley, the year he led Manchester United to the double. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    He remains a curious, endlessly compelling mix. Willing to send himself up for advertising campaigns but taking his art extremely seriously, Cantona has at times been repulsed by the media (most obviously in his post-Selhurst Park suspension phase but also in a more recent altercation with a paparazzo in north London) but also used it to his advantage.   Related: Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in Manchester: let the rivalry recommence | Sid Lowe    His imperial phase in England straddled the dawn of the Premier League era, taking in league titles on both sides of the Pennines either side of its birth, and he was one of the advance guard of exotic imports who set the template for what was to come. In his relationship with Nike and his knowledge of his own self worth, Cantona pointed the way to the world of super agents and globalisation. He has always claimed not to be guided by money and is one of the few former players willing to prod and probe on whether modern football has lost something along the way. In open, expansive mood he suggests governing bodies should mandate clubs to make 25% of their tickets affordable in return for their share of television income. \u201cFootball is a popular sport. So it\u2019s important that the working-class people can go to the stadium. Players, young players, 95% of them come from working-class backgrounds \u2013 everywhere in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThey need to go to the stadium and see the matches live, not only on television. Television is great. In the pub, you can see lots of people together. But it\u2019s not the same, you see different things in the stadium than on TV.\u201d To illustrate his point Cantona recalls Frank Rijkaard\u2019s Barcelona side and how their trio of attackers \u2013 Eto\u2019o, Messi and Ronaldinho \u2013 would stay on the halfway line when defending a corner in order to deprive their opponent of bodies in the box. \u201cThe federation should sell the rights under certain conditions. It\u2019s very dangerous to exclude the working-class people who are the soul of the sport, to exclude the kids who will maybe go on to become a professional.\u201d         Eric Cantona\u2019s preview for ITV\u2019s Euro 2016 coverage.    Ask him now about the impact of the Glazers and overseas owners on the game and, with a wave of his hand, he says they are \u201call the same\u201d. Politicians, businessmen, Fifa executives \u2013 all get similarly short shrift. \u201cToday you have almost all overseas owners, coming from all around the world. It depends how you direct the club. If you don\u2019t have an American businessman, you will have an English businessman,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an English businessman, you will have a Chinese businessman or a Malaysian businessman. They are all the same. It\u2019s a business. The difference is that maybe an English businessman knows more about the soul of the club and the community.\u201d He worries, too, about the potentially corrosive effect of too much money too soon on young footballers and their families. \u201cEven when I was young I heard people saying that footballers earned too much money,\u201d he says, recalling his formative years with Auxerre. \u201cBut the difference is in my time, I never heard my father say to me or make me think that I had to play for money. It was only about passion, only about the dream.\u201d What has changed? \u201cMaybe the media. It\u2019s the reality TV generation. It\u2019s all about shit, I think \u2013 cars, celebrities, all these kinds of things that we don\u2019t really need. In my time it was very different. It\u2019s a very interesting subject. Now the parents want their kids to earn money, to be famous.\u201d Cantona\u2019s grandparents on his father\u2019s side fled the Spanish civil war and spent a year in a refugee camp in Argel\u00e8s and he has recently sought to deliver on a promise to help those similarly afflicted through a French charity. \u201cI give a small house, it\u2019s not a castle. But it\u2019s in a great part of Marseille, with around 200 square metres of garden,\u201d he says. \u201cWe renovated it, we had it painted. We bought all the furniture, all the plates. I didn\u2019t take a picture with them and put it on Facebook or Twitter. I\u2019m not this kind of person. If you hadn\u2019t asked, I wouldn\u2019t have told you. But I said I would do that, in the hope that other people who can do it will do it. Some of the people who like to speak, the actors and so on, they are all from the left side but they don\u2019t give anything to anyone.\u201d     \u2018It\u2019s the reality TV generation. Now parents want their kids to earn money, to be famous. In my time it was only about passion, about the dream.\u2019 Photograph: Sebastian Nevols/ITV    As a player, Cantona had a famously complex, combustible relationship with the French federation and successive national coaches. So it is perhaps no surprise that the man who once said he would well up at God Save the Queen but felt nothing for La Marseillaise is willing England to win this summer \u2013 even if he thinks their mentality is wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t care about France,\u201d he says, emphatically. \u201cI don\u2019t care at all about France. In terms of football, I am an Englishman. I have in my veins the English blue blood.   Related: David Squires on \u2026 Louis van Gaal's Manchester United swansong    \u201cThe managers of English players, they don\u2019t need to go away for a month before the start of a competition,\u201d Cantona continues. \u201cThey lose all their energy. They are all together, they are fed up. The English mentality is to turn up three hours before the game, play the game and enjoy the game. If I am the manager of England, I wouldn\u2019t bring all the players together for one month. The Germans can do it, the Italians can do it. But the English should just turn up and play. If you remember Denmark when they won the European Championship, they were all on holiday a week before. Some cultures, they can spend two months together. But the English, no. It does not mean they are not professional. They are very professional. But it\u2019s not in their mentality.\u201d Equally, he quite fancies the idea of Portugal triumphing \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo deserves it, he says, and besides he could join in the celebrations. Cantona couldn\u2019t be happier with life in Lisbon, where he now lives with his family. \u201cI feel alive here,\u201d he says. A Croatian film, Anka, will come out later this year and he is also planning one in Chinese, learning his lines phonetically. Looking back on his own football career, it doesn\u2019t rankle that he never lit up the biggest stage for his country. \u201cI tried my best. I did everything I could do. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I tried my best. I have no regrets. If you say that to everyone before the game \u2013 try your best, give everything you can and after you lose, no regrets. Then you can sleep. Like a baby. I sleep like a baby.\u201d",
