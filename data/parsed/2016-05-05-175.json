  "body": "Kronenbourg 1664: \u2018The Alsace-tians\u2019 (starts at 00:04) - UK Eric Cantona demonstrates that his zoological knowledge extends beyond seagulls and sardines as he introduces us to the Alsace-tians in the latest instalment of an excellent series of adverts for Kronenbourg 1664.Agency: Ogilvy & MatherDirector: Matthijs van Heijningen Currys PC World: \u2018Box Room\u2019 (starts at 01:08) - UK The Christmas commercials for Currys PC World featuring Jeff Goldblum have been picking up lots of advertising awards so agency AMV/BBDO are determined to maintain the comedy momentum. No Hollywood star for this advert pushing new TVs ahead of the European Championships this summer but plenty of laughs nonetheless.Agency: Abbott Mead Vickers BBDODirector: Michael Downing Co-op: \u2018BBQs\u2019 (starts at 01:51) - Switzerland With the sun finally shining after a dismal spring, we can all enjoy the prospect of renewing our relationship with charred sausages as we gather around the family barbecue to watch dad behave as though he\u2019s just discovered fire. This lovely Swiss commercial imagines barbecues returning from warmer climes and bringing joy into all our lives.Agency: ContextaDirector: JJ Keith P&G: \u2018Rio\u2019 (starts at 03:13) - US Don\u2019t panic when you watch this advert for P&G ... you haven\u2019t forgotten Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s on a different date in the US and this emotional commercial is designed to make us all appreciate what our mums do by depicting how maternal devotion gave this summer\u2019s Olympians the self-belief they need to win gold medals. Not all of them obviously, most will go home with nothing... but their mothers will still love them!
