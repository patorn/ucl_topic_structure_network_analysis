  "body": "Two goals wrongly disallowed, one questionable penalty conceded and Sam Allardyce still ended the game with a smile and a wave. This was a world removed from the great majority of Sunderland\u2019s season, a day in which the sun shone, the fans sung incessantly and the manager could make nine changes, give debuts to three promising young players, leave the man credited with single-handedly saving their top-flight status, Jermain Defoe, on the bench and still enjoy a convincing, and very nearly match-winning, performance.   Related: Controlled explosion at Old Trafford after Manchester United abandon final game    Allardyce was too relieved to criticise the match officials furiously, although he did appear tempted. \u201cWe\u2019re very glad those decisions had no bearing on where we finished in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019d needed three points today we\u2019d have been in serious trouble, with offsides we didn\u2019t think were offside and a penalty we didn\u2019t think was a penalty.\u201d He explained his team selection by saying: \u201cThe players who worked so hard to get us safe had no need to come out and exert themselves any more, and put themselves through the mill.\u201d However, the decision to field a starting XI featuring a left flank, in the left-back Tom Robson and the winger Rees Greenwood, populated entirely by 20-year-old debutants, carried with it a risk that a wildly promising conclusion to the season would end on a slightly downhearted note. Instead, they offered only further encouragement. \u201cThese were 11 players who don\u2019t play on a regular basis, yet they matched a Watford side that was at full-strength on their own ground,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cIf you consider we averaged two points per game over the last six games, that\u2019s top-six stuff. If we can start where we\u2019ve left off, we can have a better season than this one. Next season let\u2019s get 12 points from the first six games, not the last six.\u201d Watford\u2019s season, on the other hand, ended precisely as it began: with a 2-2 draw. For all their reliance on the match officials, they fashioned many more opportunities than their opponents, ending with a 21-6 advantage on shots taken, although many of them were sent from distance either into the hands of Jordan Pickford or, more frequently, into the crowd. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores ended his final match as Watford manager \u201ccompletely happy\u201d \u2013 both with the game and his single season in charge. \u201cI think the first year [after promotion] is the most difficult year,\u201d he said. \u201cTo build a squad in pre-season was completely difficult because players want security and Watford was new in the division. Watford is now established in the Premier League, so next year is coming more players, more quality.\u201d The home side made the better start, with Almen Abdi, Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl, Odion Ighalo and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado coming close in the opening half-hour, but Sunderland proved much more clinical, scoring from their first significant opportunity. Pr\u00f6dl\u2019s slip on the halfway line allowed Dame N\u2019Doye to run unhindered down the left before passing inside to Jeremain Lens, whose drive was well saved. The ball was immediately worked back to Lens and this time his low centre was turned into a now totally exposed goal by Jack Rodwell. From there, Sunderland could have had the game won by half-time. Two minutes later Duncan Watmore had a goal disallowed, even though Nathan Ak\u00e9 appeared to have played him onside, and two minutes after that N\u2019Doye was denied a fine chance by Pr\u00f6dl\u2019s last-ditch challenge.

When Watford won another corner two minutes later O\u2019Shea wasn\u2019t taking any chances, with both arms around the giant Austrian defender as the ball came in. It was cleared, Sunderland broke and moments later Watmore played in Lens, who turned inside Ak\u00e9 and scored from 10 yards. Sunderland might have felt those two incidents evened themselves out but eight minutes later they were cursing. Sebastian Larsson\u2019s right-wing free-kick was headed in by a diving Lens at the far post \u2013 but again it was disallowed for an extremely marginal offside. Watford took the free-kick, sped up the other end and promptly won a rather soft penalty, after O\u2019Shea and Lamine Kon\u00e9 simultaneously ran into Jurado, the referee blaming the former as he blew his whistle. Deeney swept in the spot-kick as Pickford dived the wrong way. Man of the match Duncan Watmore (Sunderland)",
