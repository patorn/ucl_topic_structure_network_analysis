The world\u2019s fifth-largest tobacco producer, Indonesia has more than 500,000 tobacco fields feeding the national and international tobacco markets. While international and domestic laws prohibit minors from performing hazardous work, thousands of children continue to work in tobacco fields says Human Rights Watch, which interviewed 130 children about working conditions on small-scale farms across the country.

Despite this, Human Rights Watch says that its researchers found children as young as eight being routinely exposed to nicotine, toxic pesticides, extreme heat and other dangers as a result of their work cultivating and harvesting tobacco leaves.  Children interviewed for the report in four of Indonesia\u2019s tobacco growing regions complained of vomiting, nausea, headaches and dizziness \u2013 side-effects that the group says are consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, which occurs when nicotine is absorbed through the skin while handling tobacco, and could have lasting adverse effects on a child\u2019s brain and physical development. As well as exposure to nicotine poisoning, children interviewed by the human rights group came into regular contact with pesticides, fertilisers and other chemical agents without adequate protection. Only a few children said they wore any protective equipment while handling tobacco or using dangerous chemicals.  Indonesian tobacco companies and multinational firms purchase tobacco grown in Indonesia. Although the majority of tobacco grown in Indonesia is used for domestic production, in 2013, Indonesia exported tobacco worth about $200m (\u00a3137m).  Tobacco grown in farms across the country often enters domestic and international supply chains through a complex chain of middle-men, tobacco leaf-buyers and farming co-operatives. Human Rights Watch says that the failure of domestic and international buyers of Indonesian tobacco to monitor and track their supply chains meant that it was impossible for them to ensure that their products were not made with hazardous child labour.  \u201cTobacco companies shouldn\u2019t contribute to the use of hazardous child labour through their supply chains,\u201d says Margaret Wurth, children\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWhen tobacco companies don\u2019t even know where the tobacco they purchase has come from, there\u2019s no way they can ensure children haven\u2019t put their health at risk to produce it.\u201d   Related: Carrying bricks, picking potatoes: all in a day's work for Syrian children in Lebanon | Nick Grono    The International Labour Organisation (ILO) defines hazardous work as \u201cwork which \u2026 is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children\u201d. The UN body estimates that there are up to 1.5 million children working in Indonesia\u2019s agricultural sector, which includes tobacco as well as rubber and palm oil. According to the World Bank, just under 12% of Indonesia\u2019s rural population lives below the national poverty line. Many of the children interviewed by Human Rights Watch for its report said that they worked in the tobacco fields to contribute to the family income.  Human Rights Watch is calling for the Indonesian government to update its list of hazardous occupations for children to explicitly prohibit any work that involves direct contact with tobacco.",
