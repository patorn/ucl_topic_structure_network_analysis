  "body": "The arts community has come out fighting in support of Melbourne critic Philippa Hawker, who was one of 30 journalists to be made forcibly redundant by Fairfax Media this week. A petition to the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Mark Forbes, to retain Hawker, who has been writing about film and the arts since 1997, has been signed by hundreds of readers, including actor Geoffrey Rush, writers Helen Garner and Christos Tsiolkas, comedian Magda Szubanski and broadcaster Phillip Adams. \u201cPhilippa Hawker is one of the most astute and engaged of the critics working in Australia. Her dismissal is a stupid and short-sighted decision driven by panic not sense,\u201d said Tsiolkas. Garner said: \u201cThis is a crazy waste of a fine talent and decades of experience.\u201d The Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review are losing more than 80 journalists in this round of cuts, 30 on the AFR alone. Artists have been particularly hard hit \u2013 the SMH\u2019s Rocco Fazzari, the Age\u2019s John Spooner and the Fin\u2019s Rod Clement are all leaving. Among those writers taking a package are aviation journalist Jamie Freed, careers specialist Fiona Smith, SMH national affairs editor Tom Allard, Age environment editor Tom Arup and Sunday Age senior writer Jill Stark.  Greg Hywood\u2019s paper cut  In the same week he was losing some of his best talent, Fairfax Media CEO Greg Hywood was in talks to merge Fairfax\u2019s New Zealand business with APN News & Media and was involved in a pow-wow withindustry rivals to talk up the newspaper business. Newspaper Works \u2013 representing News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, West Australian Newspapers and APN News & Media \u2013 not so subtly changed its name to NewsMediaWorks on Tuesday, dropping the word \u201cnewspaper\u201d along the way. It all points to Hywood pulling the plug on printing the Monday to Friday papers, perhaps as early as February next year. News Corp\u2019s Logies logic   Related: The reason News Corp has it in for Waleed Aly? Not sure, sorry    No one seems to care when The Block host Scott Cam or Today\u2019s Karl Stefanovic win the Gold Logie, a publicly-voted award for the most popular person on television. But when Waleed Aly won it on Sunday night all hell broke loose in some quarters. Almost as if on cue News Corp Australia columnists Andrew Bolt, Miranda Devine and Rita Panahi devoted their columns to how \u201cludicrous\u201d Aly\u2019s win was. Panahi even called for an end to the Logies: \u201cThis cringe-worthy affair has long been mocked as a lame irrelevancy but it well and truly jumped the shark last night and not just because the top award at TV\u2019s \u2018night of nights\u2019 went to a divisive co-host of a lowly rating program\u201d. In her piece titled \u201cWaleed Aly Mustafa screw loose somewhere\u201d Devine blamed it all on the \u201cself-loathing of the left and their relentless need to elevate themselves above the mob\u201d. Bolt said that Aly\u2019s success \u201cis a walking contradiction of claims that Muslims or people from Middle Eastern families are invariably the oppressed\u201d and The Project co-host should just have said \u201cthanks\u201d.           The Project\u2019s Waleed Aly wins the Gold Logie    The Bolt Report: is there anyone out there? The first 11 episodes of The Bolt Report, Andrew Bolt\u2019s new show at 7pm weeknights on Sky News, averaged 23,254 viewers nationally. On Sky News alone, even Alan Jones (36,122) and Paul Murray (30,186) are more popular. Meanwhile over on The Project on Channel Ten Aly and Carrie Bickmore get about 700,000 viewers in the five major capital cities alone, rising to close to a million when the regional numbers are added in. Just saying. Mark Colvin on the road to recovery The ABC\u2019s PM host Mark Colvin is taking a few weeks off work after cancer surgery and radiation treatment. After a nasty skin cancer was removed from his head Colvin continued to broadcast his daily program on RN and local radio but radiation therapy has taken its toll and he is now very tired, he tells Weekly Beast. After his final treatment next week he will take a month off to recover. Colvin assures us the prognosis is good and he is looking forward to finishing off the last few chapters of his book and returning to work in late June.     Malcolm Turnbull campaigns in Melbourne. Buzzfeed editor Mark Di Stefano has a book deal covering the federal election campaign. Photograph: Michael Dodge/Getty Images    What a time to have a book deal  We are only in the first week of the federal election campaign but already one of the journalists on the campaign trail has signed a book deal. BuzzFeed\u2019s political editor Mark Di Stefano is writing a book for MUP titled What a time to be alive: That and other lies in the 2016 campaign. MUP describes it as \u201cthe ugly and un-sanitised diary behind the curtain of the double dissolution election campaign\u201d. The former ABC reporter will document the day-by-day activities of an election campaign and what goes on behind the scenes.  Good Weekend\u2019s murder mystery We\u2019d love to know what went on behind the scenes at the Good Weekend when its cover story \u201cSue Neill-Fraser and the murder that divided Tasmania\u201d was published in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age on 7 May.  Written by Greg Callaghan the story was about a trial in Tasmania in 2010 in which Neill-Fraser was found guilty of murdering her partner, Bob Chappell, on board the couple\u2019s yacht on Hobart\u2019s River Derwent. The story has been covered by multiple outlets as it has been labelled a miscarriage of justice on the scale of a Lindy Chamberlain. But the Callaghan story completely disappeared from the website shortly after it was published.  GW editor Amelia Lester wasn\u2019t giving anything away when we asked what happened. \u201cWe are reviewing the story and during this time it won\u2019t be available,\u201d Lester said.   Related: Chris Graham on editing New Matilda: 'I have pissed off a lot of people'    Betting the house on independent media Pleas for financial support from independent media are common and we\u2019ve become used to emails from Crikey and New Matilda asking us to support them by subscribing. But one email from NM publisher Chris Graham on Sunday certainly stood out. \u201cBuy A House And Boost Independent Media!\u201d Graham said.  \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever thought about buying a house to fund help fund independent media that doesn\u2019t kowtow to corporate and government interests, now\u2019s your chance,\u201d Graham wrote under a picture of his $719,000 Canberra house. \u201cNo kidding! I\u2019m selling my house in Canberra. You can view it in all its Mawson loveliness here. It\u2019s not an entirely random and shameless free plug \u2013 the proceeds from the sale will be invested into New Matilda, to keep our journalism fierce and independent.\u201d",
