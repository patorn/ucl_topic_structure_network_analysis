Malfunctioning teams make people unhappy, demotivated and unproductive at work, and are a common cause of people leaving their job. For Alistair Shepherd, co-founder of London-based people analytics startup Saberr, this is a costly problem that technology can help alleviate very simply and very cheaply \u2013 it\u2019s just a case of doing the maths. \u201cMore than 80% of startups fail to deliver a return to their investors, and two thirds of that is down to team dynamics,\u201d he says, citing Professor Noam Wasserman, author of The Founder\u2019s Dilemmas, who taught him at Harvard Business School. \u201cI wanted to look at what was behind that.\u201d     Alistair Shepherd, co-founder of people analytics startup Saberr.    Shepherd\u2019s background is in aerospace engineering (which he took to PhD level in the UK) and entrepreneurship (he studied this in the US at Harvard and the MIT Sloan School of Management). Today he is still an engineering researcher and entrepreneur in residence at the University of Southampton. Saberr, his third startup, founded in 2013, taps into his fascination with what makes a good project team. Much of HR is about recognising and managing individuals when it\u2019s how people function in teams that makes the biggest difference to their performance, Shepherd says.  \u201cHistorically, all of the psychology and psychometric profiling (eg Myers-Briggs) looks at who you are, but this can\u2019t predict what will make people work well together,\u201d he says, adding that if we could crack the formula, businesses and communities \u2013 the world \u2013 could achieve so much more. Innovation cycles would accelerate, breakthroughs would happen sooner. The key lies deep in data science. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just a case of whether you\u2019ve got certain personality types in a team; it\u2019s more subtle than that,\u201d Shepherd explains. Companies use Saberr\u2019s sophisticated online analytics software in a bid to make better recruitment decisions and to address under-performing teams \u2013 from sales to software development. It is already well documented that shared core values produce high performance, but Saberr\u2019s algorithm has gone a step further, demonstrating just how consistent this needs to be across a team \u2013 the way each person is motivated and how they react if a colleague needs more freedom or rigidity in the way they work. Inspired by the techniques used by online dating sites, which are continually refining how they match people to improve outcomes, Saberr has arrived at a formula that predicts whether a team will succeed or fail based on individuals\u2019 responses to a profiling questionnaire.    Related: It's a game changer: recruiters make a play for ideal jobseeker    Early on, Shepherd put this to the test at a business plan competition at the University of Bristol. Prior to the week-long event, Shepherd asked all members of participating teams to complete his questionnaire. He hadn\u2019t met any of the contestants and knew nothing of their business plans, skills, experience or demographics.  He crunched the numbers and predicted the rankings of the eight teams, placing details in a sealed envelope. At the end of the week, the predictions were found to have been 100% accurate. \u201cWe precisely matched all eight positions,\u201d Shepherd says. The probability of foretelling this outcome was one in more than 40,000. Saberr was on to something. Saberr\u2019s predictive ability, available to any business as a cloud-based software facility, aims to reduce the risk that new recruits will disrupt the status quo or be a poor match for the company culture. The business was accepted into Seedcamp, a large seed-stage investor, in late 2013, and has received \u00a31.8m equity funding in three rounds. It now employs 10 staff and its client base includes some big names (Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, Capco, Virgin and Bank of Ireland) as well as fast-growing startups, all keen to create and develop high-performing teams. Because it\u2019s still early days for the business, one of the most striking ways it can demonstrate its potential is to retrospectively identify high and poor performing teams, without having seen performance data. Where companies have already done the hiring, and have run into team stalemates, Saberr also provides a service. This is now a growing focus for the business. In April Saberr raised \u00a31m led by Angel CoFund, which will drive the next phase of development. \u201cWe have a brilliant tool for hiring and designing better teams. The next opportunity is to fix a malfunctioning team without having to swap out individuals,\u201d Shepherd says. Here, Saberr will provide a \u201cdigital team coach\u201d. One of the qualities Saberr measures through its questionnaires is an individual\u2019s ability to tolerate an alternative set of values in their colleagues. The \u2018coaching\u2019 solution helps shape and improve that tolerance, by prompting changes in awareness, thinking and behaviour. \u201cHumans are very adept at learning if they are helped,\u201d Shepherd explains. \u201cWe\u2019re packaging that and delivering it to people wherever they are. \u201cWe know that frequent interactions strengthen a relationship so it could be something as simple as prompting an individual to have a coffee with someone they\u2019re due to work with in a fortnight.\u201d Saberr\u2019s team optimisation tool democratises the kind of skills companies are buying into when they hire expensive team coaches to restore harmony to underperforming teams, he claims. \u201cCompanies no longer need to reserve this luxury for the C suite. Parachuting in an executive coach can cost \u00a33,000 a day. We\u2019re an order of magnitude cheaper, offering companies a way to benefit from the same sorts of insights at lower levels of management which are currently badly underserved.\u201d Broadening the focus of its analytics will expand the markets Saberr can target.  Commenting on Saberr\u2019s proposition, Andrew Marritt, founder of international people analytics practice OrganizationView, says: \u201cSaberr has taken a contemporary, big-data approach to an area that all organisations have struggled with \u2013 making teamwork part of the selection and review process. It is pioneering with this type of approach.\u201d Marritt believes the company is wise to broaden its techniques to improving existing teams, noting that recruitment has become a hot topic for HR technology, accounting for 50% of associated startup activity.  \u201cTheir model stands up to scrutiny and they are doing a good job,\u201d he says. \u201cMy advice to the company would be to stay focused and resist the temptation to broaden into other areas.\u201d He added that it is important for a young business to avoid diversifying too much and to focus on what it is best at. \u201cIn Saberr\u2019s case, that\u2019s designing and transforming teams,\u201d he says.
