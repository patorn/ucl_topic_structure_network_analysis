She was delivering the closing Arthur Miller Freedom to Write lecture of the PEN World Voices Festival. In the past, this lecture has been delivered by figures as diverse as supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor, the novelist Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and the essayist Christopher Hitchens. This year the honour went to the cultural critic Gay. PEN American executive director Suzanne Nossel introduced her as someone who \u201cmay be a Bad Feminist, but a perfect Arthur Miller Freedom to Write lecturer\u201d, in reference to the Gay\u2019s popular book of feminist essays.

After evoking the Hold Up-based image of wanting to shatter glass with a baseball bat, Gay went on to say how \u201cAL \u2013 after Lemonade\u201d, \u2013 the 12-track visual album with its nods toward infidelity, British-Somali poet Warsan Shire, and \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d that Beyonc\u00e9 dropped a week ago \u2013 the game has changed.

She talked about stalling on her upcoming memoir Hunger, which she is still working on, for fear of what vulnerabilities she is exposing in herself. \u201cThough by the power of Beyonc\u00e9, I will overcome my fear,\u201d she said to overwhelming laughter. Gay, who described herself \u201ctaking up a lot of space\u201d, has publicly chronicled her battles with her body. \u201cIt would be easy to pretend I am just fine with my body as it is \u2013 I am a feminist after all,\u201d she said after an evocative passage in which she described her body as a cage, \u201cand I believe in diverse body types \u2013 but then I have to leave my apartment and face the world.\u201d Gay was raped as a 12-year-old. \u201cThe past is written on my body,\u201d she said, talking further about how she often denied herself many basic pleasures such as wearing bright colors because she \u201cdid not feel I had the right\u201d. Gay closed her speech by describing the self-compassion she does allow herself \u201ceven though the world thinks I should [hate myself]\u201d. \u201cThe truth makes me uncomfortable too,\u201d she said of her body, \u201cbut I\u2019m also saying here\u2019s my heart \u2013 what\u2019s left of it.\u201d Saeed Jones, Buzzfeed\u2019s executive editor for culture, then joined \u201cQueen Roxane\u201d for a conversation about separating valid criticism from human beings, and not being put on a pedestal. \u201cSomeone critiqued one paragraph from the publishing marketing copy,\u201d Gay said, referring to a review she\u2019d found online, even though she had not herself turned in the manuscript yet. They \u201cextrapolated some interesting thoughts about the book as a whole\u201d she added, to a wave of laughter. Gay also spoke of her belief that Beyonc\u00e9 brought peers whose bodies had been shamed into her Lemonade videos, as \u201cmoney has never bought a black person freedom from being a target\u201d. The topic of literary gatekeepers was also raised. \u201cWhen white men write about themselves, people are like, oh my god that\u2019s groundbreaking, like Knausgaard. When a woman does it it\u2019s self indulgent,\u201d Gay said to the clapping of the crowd. She called on publishers to \u201cstep up\u201d. \u201cPublishers need to hire people of color and pay them a living wage,\u201d she said to another deafening round of applause.",
