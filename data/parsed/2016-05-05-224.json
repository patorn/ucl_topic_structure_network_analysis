  "body": "Mexican author Yuri Herrera and his translator Lisa Dillman have won the Best translated book award for Signs Preceding the End of the World, which tells the story of a young woman crossing the Mexico border into the US. The novel charts how Makina sets out in search of her brother, striking a bargain to deliver a package for a local gang leader in return for safe passage across the Rio Grande. Maya Jaggi\u2019s Guardian review hailed it as a \u201cmarvellously rich, slim novel\u201d that works \u201con many levels\u201d. Herrera is the first Spanish-language author to win the $10,000 (\u00a37,000) award for fiction, which is split equally between writer and translator, seeing off a shortlist including literary stars such as the bestselling Italian author Elena Ferrante and the Brazilian short story writer Clarice Lispector.

She reads carefully, she asks lots of questions and she makes the right decisions... Translators deserve much more recognition, and, of course, much better payment.\u201d Judge Jason Grunebaum also praised Dillman\u2019s translation, saying she had \u201ccrafted a dazzling voice in English\u201d. \u201cThis novel of real pathos and unexpected displacement in self, place, and language achieves a near perfect artistic convergence of translator and author,\u201d Grunebaum said, \u201cwhile giving readers an urgent account from today\u2019s wall-building world.\u201d The Portuguese poet Ang\u00e9lica Freitas and her translator Hilary Kaplan won the best poetry category with Rilke Shake. Freitas and Kaplan each won $5,000, for a collection warmly endorsed by judge Tess Lewis:   Related: Reading Mexico - books podcast    \u201c[Kaplan captures] the many shifts in tone in and between the lines, from playful to wry to sardonic to pathetic, even sentimental, to deadpan and back to playful, sometimes within a single poem,\u201d she said. \u201cFor all of Freitas\u2019s lyric clowning, it\u2019s clear she takes poetry too seriously not to dismantle it and use it to her own purposes.\u201d Freitas and Kaplan won the award ahead of a shortlist of six poetry collections, including China\u2019s Liu Xia \u2013 the wife of the imprisoned Nobel peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo \u2013 for her collection Empty Chairs, and Load Poems Like Guns, the work of eight Afghan women poets. The awards are administered by the University of Rochester\u2019s Three Percent blog, and funded by Amazon.com\u2019s literary partnership programmes.",
