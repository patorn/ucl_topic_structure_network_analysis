  "body": "My first visit to Wales for these pages was such a blast that a press release arrives at an opportune moment. The Hotel at Portmeirion has kicked up its culinary offering a\u00a0few notches with an ambitious tasting menu using the finest local produce. I\u2019m keen to see what an ex-La B\u00e9casse chef can do. But more\u00a0than anything, I\u2019m keen to see\u00a0Portmeirion. This candy-coloured village on the Snowdonia coast in north Wales is the folly to end all follies. Built by architect Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis between 1925 and 1976, his \u201chome for fallen buildings\u201d became famous during the 1960s as the setting for TV\u2019s cult spy show, The Prisoner. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s rammed with tourists in summer, but in blustery, off-season weather \u2013 the brightly painted houses empty and blank-faced, the waters of Afon Dwyryd glittering like mercury in the distance \u2013 the little place casts a\u00a0powerful spell. How I wish I could say the same for our dinner. The village\u2019s hotel is equally lovely, and equally oddball: the website tells us it has been patronised by \u201cpoliticians, tycoons and other swindlers\u201d. The curvilinear, parquet-floored room is\u00a0pretty and serene, and the tasting menu promises enchantments to match the location: smoked duck soldiers, crab raviolo, burnt pear, lemon verbena yoghurt. Sadly, few of the (sometimes insanely) ambitious dishes reach the dizzy heights they\u2019re aiming for. Things kick off well enough with\u00a0a\u00a0soft-boiled egg on a marshy hummock of mushrooms with toast\u00a0soldiers sandwiching more mushroom and smoked duck, truffled (both oil and fungus) to within an inch of its life: fun and funky. But then things go awry. Scallop with \u201cceleriac and truffle risotto\u201d arrives in its shell on a bowl of seaweed-strewn pebbles over which our server pours liquid nitrogen to billow out chilly fog (\u201cYou don\u2019t eat this.\u201d Thank you: helpful). I\u2019m guessing those inverted commas on the menu are because this bears no resemblance to risotto: it\u2019s a minuscule dice of the root bollocksed by more truffle oil. Spurted around are pea puree, shaved truffle, peashoots and \u2013 argh! \u2013 white chocolate. It\u2019s the living definition of trying too hard. Or wait: maybe that accolade should be reserved for a chunk of excellent venison obliterated by a\u00a0damp anorak of blue-cheesey crumbs, and blobbed by an acrid, juniper-flavoured puree that\u2019s a bit like syrupy Marmite. Oh, and a cube of opaque, green wobbly stuff: because being jellied is what broccoli has been crying out for. Amazingly enough, it tastes of unseasoned broccoli jelly. There\u2019s an overcooked fish dish presented as though it were a\u00a0Faberg\u00e9 egg. And one of those chocolate desserts that collapses in a\u00a0molten faint at the approach of its sauce. This isn\u2019t food to revel in, it\u2019s food designed for a breathy, titillated voiceover on mainstream television. Many dishes arrive on slate. Dear\u00a0God, enough with the slate: the screeching of the cutlery, the inability of the staff to clear tables with any kind of grace, the inevitable seepage and leakage. One dessert includes basil sorbet. I don\u2019t like basil desserts at the best of times, and this one is way too sweet, but that\u2019s my personal taste and I\u2019m happy to leave it. Of course, it melts inexorably off its slate, creating an ectoplasmic mess on the tablecloth, as though it had been vomited on by Slimer from Ghostbusters. Throughout dinner, a harpist tinkles away mournfully, a suitable soundtrack to my mood. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to enjoy delivering this verdict. A lot of people are working very hard here, and the staff are hugely sweet; the poor things are still there the next morning, serving us our (excellent) breakfast.

It\u2019s sacrilege\u2019 \u2013 restaurant review    The sad fact is that this is what you get when overweening, slightly pompous ambition is outstripped by actual ability. But if you\u2019re wowed by melting domes of chocolate, puddles of dry ice and \u201ctransparent\u201d ravioli with all the appeal of sheets of gelatine stuffed with tinny-tasting fish, this might reasonably blow your mind. I wish the chef would chill out and celebrate the area\u2019s bounty without resorting to dated, overblown theatrics. The village outside may be a creative fairyland, but our meal is sad evidence of what happens when creativity is taken just that little bit too far. \u2022 The Hotel Portmeirion, Minffordd, Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd, 01766 770000.
