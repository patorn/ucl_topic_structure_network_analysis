Maybe it will take me back to being an innocent 16-year-old playing guitar in my bedroom while Alex, Geddy and Neil hammered through their 1976 concept album. It may make me cry, it may make me want to jump up and down. I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that it will make me feel. And it is there I began my journey of writing a play about dementia choirs, Before I Leave, for this year\u2019s Festival of Voice Cardiff.   Related: The one-man crusader improving lives with dementia    Two and a half years ago I found myself in a battered rugby club in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales. I had been asked to run a writing workshop with a choir of people living with dementia and their carers. My uncle had recently died after a battle with vascular dementia; my father had fallen and broken his pelvis; my personal life was in crisis and I had been writing about the darker side of humanity. I decided to sit in on their choir practice. Some members had been led in, some were in wheelchairs, their skin almost translucent in the afternoon light. Others sat in silence, some looked gravely ill. I sat at the back of the 50-strong group and watched and listened as the Cwm Taf Choir blasted out their repertoire of \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d, \u201cThe Young Ones\u201d, \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d and \u201cCalon L\u00e2n\u201d. By the end I was a shuddering mass of tears and goose pimples. I knew this story had to be told. I had seen people come alive, voices soaring, feet tapping and smiles connecting. Everyone in that room had felt those songs permeate through their dementia-damaged bodies and the result was awe-inspiring. According to the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, with numbers set to rise to more than 2 million by 2051. Around 225,000 people will develop dementia this year, that\u2019s one new case every three minutes. More and more families are affected by the disease \u2013 70% of people in care homes have dementia or severe memory problems \u2013 and the fact that choirs are playing such an important part in managing dementia led me to want to write the play.         Listen to 2112 by Rush    In a time of benefit cuts, library and communal spaces closures, zero-hours contracts, food banks and an economic policy that parades as moral imperative in one of the most deprived areas in Britain, I saw people living with dementia getting together to sing and to support each other. I said thank you to the Alzheimer\u2019s Society support workers and choir leaders, got in my car, drove home and started writing. Within a week I had sent a rough treatment to National Theatre Wales. They bravely gave me a development commission and I spent the next six months visiting the choir, sitting in on the carers\u2019 group on the Gurnos council estate in Merthyr, hearing what they thought was important to say in the play, running writing sessions at dementia care units around Wales and immersing myself in all things dementia-related. What is it about singing that makes songs, lyrics and melodies remain accessible in our brain long after we lose other vital functions? Many factors are at play, I think. As with my relationship to Rush, what I\u2019ve witnessed all over Wales is that listening to music is an emotional moment. For centuries humans have created and listened to music. What is new is that recent neuroimaging research has shown that the emotion and reward centres of the brain \u2013 the amygdala and nucleus accumbens \u2013 are activated when we listen to music. The academic researcher Nicholas Simmons-Stern explains: \u201cIn part due to its emotionality, music increases attention, and for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s, who often develop severe attention deficits as a result of the disease, this may create stronger and longer-lasting memories.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe also know from neuroimaging studies that musical processing involves a wide range of brain areas, including many that are affected minimally by the degenerative effects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, especially in its early stages.         Listen to Before I Leave \u2026    \u201cMusical memory may as a result be less hindered by Alzheimer\u2019s than non-musical memory, which relies only on standard memory areas, such as the medial temporal lobes, that are some of the first parts of the brain to be affected by the disease. In other words, music may provide a form of \u2018backup\u2019 memory, one that Alzheimer\u2019s patients can rely on when their normal memory systems fail.\u201d     \u2026 by Manic Street Preachers\u2019 James Dean Bradfield and Nicky Wire. Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns    As well as putting on the play, National Theatre Wales\u2019s TEAM programme has been running a community project called I\u2019ll Sing This Song, in which musician Ben Tinniswood, film-maker Kym Epton, photographer and designer Paul Thomas and I have worked with three Alzheimer\u2019s Society-affiliated community choirs around Wales. The project\u2019s title is a line from a new song written specially for the play by Nicky Wire and James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers. Each choir learned and performed it, as well as creating their own song that was captured on film and will form the centrepiece of a digital resource \u2013 a toolkit for community groups, choirs and schools \u2013 to help others with dementia. We witnessed many transcendental moments. The painfully silent woman in Wrexham who, when prompted, walked into the middle of the 60-strong choir circle and sang a note-perfect rendition of \u201cEdelweiss\u201d then quietly walked back to her seat after having reduced us to tears. Or Ruth, the choir leader, who, together with the members created a song from scratch in 10 minutes. In Brecon, with a group led by voice coach Sarah Harman, I watched people living with dementia perform the trickiest vocal warm-ups and choral pieces without a mistake. Their eyes lit up, their bodies were animated, their voices took flight. One member, who was initially reticent about joining in, would bring me a poem every session. At the last one, he took to the small stage and gave a perfect rendition of a poem on the theme of never being afraid to try. Asked why she attended the group, one female member said: \u201cSinging brings me back to life.\u201d What more can you say? It is hoped that the digital resource will not only help those living with dementia, but will more widely promote a greater understanding of the condition. Users will be encouraged to interact with the material already created and participate by uploading videos and images of their own sessions, performances and memories. This contributor content, from all over Wales, will feed an interactive hub for the I\u2019ll Sing this Song project and the notes will reverberate on and on.

Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images    When writing the play, I found that whenever I mentioned the combination of dementia, choirs and the south Wales valleys, people said: \u201cAwww, that\u2019s lovely.\u201d But I wanted to tell the hard truth. I developed six main characters whose journeys are fictional representations of real testimony. A former policeman and an ex-miner who haven\u2019t seen each other since the miners\u2019 strike in 1984 are brought together by their dementia. A man in his early 50s, diagnosed with early-onset dementia, with his wife and carer. Ignored by their friends, their dreams on hold, they cling to each other. One older woman is neglected by her carers at the nursing home. The library where they meet is being closed, the social services funding is under threat and there is a trip to Britain\u2019s Got Talent auditions. Through it all, singing is keeping them alive. They really are all in it together. All of us can remember a song that meant much to us at a certain point in life. First love, lost love, the best summer or the loneliest winter. In the fog and confusion of dementia, hearing a particular song can ignite a forgotten flame that, for a moment, lights the way forward. After working with and visiting many choirs, I can say I never failed to shed a tear, see my own life reflected, burst into laughter or share a common humanity with its members. My favourite playwright, Arthur Miller, said he wrote plays to make people \u201cfeel less alone\u201d. These community choirs all over Wales and Britain, week after week, do the same. \u2022 Before I Leave is at Sherman theatre, Cardiff, from Friday until 11 June as part of Festival of Voice. nationaltheatrewales.org.",
