  "body": "For Hillary Clinton, the week that Donald Trump finally sealed the Republican presidential nomination should have been a triumphant one.   Related: Endless war: Trump and the fantasy of cost-free conflict    After a final few delegates nudged him past the official finishing line on Thursday, here at last was the candidate Democrats always dreamed of running against: unpopular, undisciplined and ostensibly unelectable in November\u2019s general election. Yet in the Alice in Wonderland world of American politics in 2016, nothing is what it seems. Clinton supporters would instead have to stomach six impossible things before the week was out. The first was the sight of the former secretary of state falling behind her Republican opponent in an average of national opinion polls.  Though by a wafer-thin \u2013 and probably temporary \u2013 margin, the breaching of this symbolic threshold could yet become self-fulfilling, if it normalises the once unthinkable prospect of a Trump White House. Then came a damning report by an independent inspector at the state department, who contradicted Clinton\u2019s claims that she had been allowed to use a private email server for official business while serving as the nation\u2019s chief diplomat.  Once again, things were not quite as simple as they appeared. Clinton allies argued the report showed other former secretaries of state up to the same tricks. But only one is running for president. With the FBI still investigating whether Clinton broke federal law, this is an old wound that could open again before the contest is over. Some Democrats, such as the progressive champion Elizabeth Warren, show signs of rallying round their beleaguered captain. But the FBI investigation also complicates the ability of the party\u2019s most influential cheerleader to come to the rescue.  At a press conference in Japan, the normally loquacious Barack Obama flat-out refused to take a question from a journalist who asked whether the email scandal undermined Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness.  In part, the ringing non-endorsement reflected the president\u2019s need for political as well as legal neutrality. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the race so far is that it is the Democrats \u2013 not the Republicans, who started with 17 candidates \u2013 who have not yet decided their nominee.

The next surprise blow to Team Clinton this week was new opinion polling in California, where the penultimate and largest Democratic primary takes place on 7 June. It showed Sanders virtually neck and neck, forcing Clinton to schedule extra appearances to try to avoid the humiliating prospect of winning the national nomination race on the same day as she loses the largest state. To make matters worse, Sanders responded to Clinton\u2019s decision to pull out of a scheduled televised debate by taking up a subsequently rescinded offer to face Donald Trump instead. Though establishment Democrats fumed at the disloyalty of such a stunt, few doubted it would have drawn giant audiences. Somewhat less attention was drawn to the final shock news of the week: a federal investigation into campaign contributions to a longtime Clinton confidant, Governor Terry McAuliffe of Virginia. With the FBI investigating both the candidate and the elected official with perhaps the closest ties to her family, Trump may have more ammunition for his \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d taunts than even he expected. \u2018Bernie is going to be in her rear-view mirror very, very soon\u2019 Whether these surprise developments in one week in May add up to lasting consequences in November is, of course, another matter. Some strategists in Washington believe Clinton should simply sit tight and ride out a storm that will pass quickly. \u201cThe polls are showing the race effectively tied, but Trump and Clinton are at very different points in their campaign,\u201d said veteran political analyst Charlie Cook.  \u201cThe Republicans have come back in line faster than a lot of people thought, but Sanders will be out of [Clinton\u2019s] way in a week and a half, and her natural lead will return to three or four points.  \u201cIn November, it is not going to matter a whit if he won California. Bernie Sanders is going to be in her rear-view mirror very, very soon.\u201d Cook argues that scrutiny can only get harder for Trump, while Clinton may have been through the toughest phase.

I would rather be her than [Trump]. There are too many things that have to go right for him. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in a terribly challenging place.\u201d Certainly, to envisage Trump\u2019s national poll improvement bearing fruit requires some heroic assumptions about the state contests that actually decide presidential elections. Not only would the New York billionaire probably have to transform previously safe Democratic territory in the rust belt, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and the more finely balanced Ohio. He would also have to stop Clinton holding more diverse states like Virginia and Colorado and possibly winning back Arizona and Georgia. Other experts, such as Larry Sabato of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, suggest Clinton\u2019s struggle to conclude the Democratic race could make for a bumpy party convention in July. \u201cHow she handles Sanders is key,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cIf she does it skilfully, it will be crucial to motivating younger voters, who are very hard to get out to vote if they are not enthusiastic.    She can\u2019t control the FBI. She started that ball rolling and will have to live with the consequences  Larry Sabato, Center for Politics at the University of Virginia     \u201cIf he wins California, it guarantees he will go forward to the convention trying to turn every last delegate and it could be very damaging for her. It is a turning point.\u201d Just as importantly, Sabato argues, Clinton needs to go on the offensive and set her own agenda over the next few weeks.  \u201cSome things she can\u2019t control,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can\u2019t control the FBI. She started that ball rolling and will have to live with the consequences. She has to demonstrate how she is going to attack Trump. They are all over the map at the moment because there is an embarrassment of riches, but there is devilry in that in a way.\u201d Right now, most pundits agree that it all makes for a noisy political environment in which it is hard to judge who is really winning. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, professor of communications at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, believes the best approach is for Clinton to try to define her own news agenda, rather than respond to that of her critics. \u2018The news environment matters,\u201d she said. \u201cThe email news could have been much worse if it had fallen in a quieter week. She has benefited this week from the fact that there has been a cluttered news environment.\u201d   Related: Travelgate to Furnituregate: a guide to the Clinton scandals of the 90s    But Jamieson, who founded factcheck.org to help hold politicians to account, is scathing of the tactics adopted by the Clinton campaign regarding the emails, which she believes distort the degree to which the rules have changed since previous secretaries of state were in office. \u201c[Clinton] is making the best she can of it, but she is doing it by misrepresenting the facts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be smarter not to offer misleading inferences.\u201d Beyond all else, this suggests it is the ongoing furore over her emails, rather than Sanders or Trump, that could really spoil the party. \u201cCalifornia is not likely to come back to haunt her,\u201d Jamieson said. \u201cThe damaging thing is the report by the State Department and how it fits in the ongoing narrative.  \u201cThis speaks to a central part of her campaign \u2013 her experience \u2013 and calls into question her judgment. The question now is what is the next shoe to drop.\u201d",
