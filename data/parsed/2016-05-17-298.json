This year the Dadaab refugee complex is 25 years old: young for a city, but old for a camp that was only ever supposed to be a temporary sanctuary. Dadaab was built in 1992 for 90,000 refugees fleeing the war in Somalia. Today it is home to an estimated half a million people, 350,000 of them registered refugees \u2013 an urban area the size of Bristol, Zurich or New Orleans. Last week Kenya announced plans to close it by May of next year, to the unhappiness of many who live there. Noor Tawane, now a middle-aged father of seven and businessman in the camp, was one of Dadaab\u2019s first residents. Over the past four years, while researching a book about the camps, I have learned his story. He arrived in Dadaab on a donkey cart in 1992, at the age of seven, with his mother and father: a thin, wizened man with hennaed hair and light eyes called Idris. The family had fled the violence that engulfed southern Somalia following the collapse of the government of Siad Barre. Idris was a prosperous farmer with a lot of land on the banks of the Juba river that he was reluctant to abandon. \u201cThe most beautiful land ever is that place,\u201d Tawane says proudly \u2013 but he cannot remember directly. This is his father\u2019s memory talking.     Noor Tawane, one of Dadaab\u2019s first residents. Photograph: Ben Rawlence    One day, Tawane\u2019s elder brothers had gone to work on the farm outside their home town of Jama\u2019ame. When they didn\u2019t return, Idris went looking for them \u2013 and discovered his two boys lying dead amid the maize stalks, a bullet in each of them. So the rest of the family ran. Refugees were massing at the border with Kenya and a town of tents and huts sprang up \u2013 a bit like the \u201cJungle\u201d camp in Calais today. These waves of new arrivals prompted the Kenyan government to make a more permanent (but still temporary) arrangement: it invited the UN\u2019s refugee agency to build three planned camps around the small dusty border town of Dadaab, 90km inside Kenya. And it was into one of these, a camp called Hagadera, that Tawane, his parents and his remaining brothers and sisters were shown one morning in late 1992.   Hagadera, in Somali, means \u201cthe place of the tall trees\u201d. It was also a place of sandy gullies formed by sporadic streams in the rainy season, where nomads brought their camels. Twelve kilometres to the north was the town of Dadaab \u2013 hitherto a tiny settlement of 5,000 semi-nomadic people \u2013 where the UN and the other aid agencies made their own camp of tents next to the police post. To the north of Dadaab were two more camps, Ifo and Dagahaley; like Hagadera, each was designed to hold 30,000 people.  There was no fence around each camp; only, in every direction, the unremitting desert. \u201cIt was very dry, very hot!\u201d Idris told me.

Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters    North-east Kenya is lonely country and the government wanted the refugees penned in as far away as possible from everyone else. It stopped the refugees from moving further into Kenya with a roadblock on the road south and another at the Tana river in Garissa town, 100km to the south.  The UN planners designed the three camps on a grid pattern, arranged in lettered sections and numbered blocks bisected by roads wide enough for police patrol cars. The principles that have always guided the camp architecture are visibility and control, a bit like a prison \u2013 the camp follows the structure of punishment, but there has been no crime. Tawane\u2019s family was shown to a rectangle of sand in block E5 of Hagadera. The size of a plot corresponds to the number of people in each family: a UN unit of measurement (also used to calculate rations) known as \u201cfamily\u2013size\u201d.      Family plots in the sand are often marked out by thorn fences. Photograph: Ben Rawlence    Tawane\u2019s family was given a tent, and they set about planting thorn cuttings along the perimeter of their plot for a fence. Every two weeks, a truck would arrive with food for the distribution of rations: maize flour, wheat, beans. \u201cThe children couldn\u2019t adapt to the relief food,\u201d Idris recalled. \u201cFor six months they were always getting sick; I was always taking them to the hospital.\u201d  Water arrived by truck, too, every few days, before the drilling machines came and boreholes were dug. In those early days, water was only 20 metres below the surface of the desert \u2013 but by 2016, a new borehole struck water only after going down 400 metres. Half a million people use a lot of water.  Soon after they were settled in Hagadera, a group of volunteers built a school out of wood and corrugated-iron sheets. Tawane\u2019s earliest memories are of running down the sandy alleyways between the blocks, then across the open expanse in front of them, to the little school. \u201cI learned my ABC there, in Arabic,\u201d he said, \u201cwriting lessons on a narrow wooden board.\u201d In each camp, in the centre of the grid, the UN planners marked out an area for a market, with plots for stalls. The new arrivals had arranged themselves in their sections and blocks, appointing community leaders to liaise with the UN, the Kenyan government, and agencies that had suddenly appeared to run the camps\u2019 clinics.     Water is in heavy demand in the camps: a new borehole only struck a source after going down 400 metres. Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images    In many cases, those who had been in positions of authority back home, such as Tawane\u2019s father, slipped easily into leadership roles in the camps. As a businessman with some assets, he was among those invited to set up a shop in the market. The UN rations are dry and many people would wish to sell them in order to buy other things including vegetables, meat, tea or sugar. But Tawane\u2019s father refused the offer: \u201cWe\u2019ll be going home soon,\u201d Idris told them.  \u201cI never had the expectation of staying in this place,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI know I have the name of \u2018refugee\u2019, but I never accepted settling here as a permanent solution.\u201d Idris died earlier this year, after 25 years in the camp, still waiting to return to his farm. He had, though \u2013 after some years of resistance \u2013 invested in a butchery business, and bequeathed his sons a network of shops around the camp, plus three donkey carts with insulated steel boxes on their back, each sporting the word \u201cMEAT\u201d in red paint.    The government recently required the UN to dismantle some new homes because they \u201clooked too much like real houses\u201d    In time, of course, the economy of the camp grew. People would go hungry for years in order to save the capital to start a business \u2013 but these days, in the market, you can buy everything from an iPhone to an ice-cream. In time, too, the UN formalised the ad-hoc appointment of block and section leaders into municipal elections. Each camp has an elected chairman and woman, plus an overall chair who represents the three camps in discussions about everything from the siting of boreholes and problems with refuse collection, to communal relations between the different groups in the camp. After finishing high school, Tawane ran for office as youth chairman of Hagadera: \u201cI am different because I have been to trainings on democracy and I know what it is about,\u201d he said. Tawane won \u2013 and used his two terms to preach a message of inclusivity and gender mainstreaming, buzzwords he had learned from UN workshops. \u201cWomen have more choice in Dadaab,\u201d he said. \u201cNGOs teach them about female genital mutilation and forced marriage and so on. Dadaab is a more free place for women than Somalia.\u201d     A 12-month-old girl is buried at Dadaab\u2019s Ifo camp after dying of malnutrition during the 2011 famine. Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP    These days, Dadaab is a veritable melting pot, with Sudanese, Ethiopians, Congolese, Ugandans and even a lone Rwandan refugee from the 1994 genocide adding to the mix. The camp is not a democracy, more a kind of consultative autocracy, with the Kenyan government and the UN the ultimate overseers \u2013 in some areas content to operate a kind of laissez-faire governance, but in other respects fierce about enforcing restrictions.  The perversity of these restrictions has grown more acute as the camps have aged. Tawane\u2019s home for a quarter of a century is made of mud and sticks because the refugees are not allowed to pour concrete or make permanent structures. He has been through the Kenyan school system and acquired diplomas by distance learning, yet he is not allowed to work for the UN or the agencies that run the camp because he is not a Kenyan. \u201cSometimes I wonder, why has God left me like this?\u201d Tawane complains.  But he has not accepted his fate lying down. While the government has always forbidden proper sanitation and electricity in the camp, to avoid this giant slum becoming \u201cpermanent\u201d, Tawane and his friends have invested in a generator and provide power, illegally, to nearly 400 households for a monthly fee. Tawane\u2019s ingenuity exemplifies both the triumph and the tragedy of the camp system in dealing with large-scale refugee flows. Underlying their foundation is a fiction of temporariness \u2013 a fiction the Kenyan government is willing to enforce with bulldozers if necessary.     A Somali girl sings to her classmates at Illeys primary school in the Dagahaley refugee camp. Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP    The government recently required the UN to dismantle some newly built homes because they \u201clooked too much like real houses\u201d, and it has torn down illegal power lines too. If the refugees were allowed to work, to make their businesses prosper, to pay tax even \u2013 it seems clear that everyone would be better off. As Tawane himself complained: \u201cWhat could I have achieved if I hadn\u2019t been born a refugee?\u201d Despite the restrictions, however, Dadaab is working after a fashion. And even though Mogadishu appears to be stabilising, for people such as Tawane, who have made a life \u2013 and a living \u2013 in the camp, the uncertainty of life back in Somalia is not an attractive alternative. \u201cThe UN and Kenya government are saying: \u2018Go back home\u2019,\u201d said Tawane, \u201cBut for me, go back where? The house we had has been taken by other clans \u2013 and Al-Shabaab is still in control.\u201d Moreover, the economic reach of the Dadaab camps has become a part of the national landscape: powerful interests have taken root. Many Kenyans are coming to work here \u2013 for the agencies in running water, education and health services; as security guards, hoteliers and drivers; and also working for refugee businesses in the camp market that long ago outgrew its allotted space: metalworkers, tailors, computer technicians, traders of everything from sugar to sportswear. This is the largest market between Nairobi and Mogadishu, turning over $20m-$30m a year.

Some members of the police, nominally in charge of security in the camps, are paid bribes to look the other way. By day, a government spokesman might blame Dadaab refugees for terrorist attacks in Kenya and call for the camp to be closed; by night, however, this illicit trade is pouring cash into the campaign coffers of some politicians, although the government has denied this. \u201cThe Kenyans are very good at smuggling,\u201d said Tawane. \u201cThey prefer money rather than maintaining a good security in the camp.\u201d For these reasons, and because of the remoteness of a durable peace across much of southern Somalia, Dadaab seems very likely to remain, despite last week\u2019s announcement of its impending closure.  This sprawling urban slum in the middle of an inhospitable desert \u2013 the most inappropriate place for a city \u2013 is sustained by a curious mix of political intrigue, bureaucratic inertia, and the simple fact that for two generations now, it has become \u201chome\u201d. While this refugee complex does not appear on any official atlas of Kenya, the Dadaab camp is, so the saying goes, very much \u201con the map\u201d.
