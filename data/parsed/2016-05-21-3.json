  "body": "The future is here and it works. Importantly, it is not a conservative future. Boulder, Colorado, is not as famous as San Francisco or even Palo Alto \u2013 but this city of some 100,000, where the high plains end and the Rocky Mountains begin, is the leading American urban area of the 21st century. It is a bewildering alchemy of 1960s hippy culture, frontier technologies, thoughtful urban planning and burgeoning service jobs ranging from diet counselling to advanced road bike maintenance. Boulder has become the exemplar of how rich and satisfying urban life can be. It is also a Democrat stronghold. It has been voted the US\u2019s brainiest city, its happiest city, the country\u2019s foodiest place and the number one city for health. It is a standing reproach to Donald Trump, and indeed Britain\u2019s rightwing Brexiteers who ape his thinking. The place is booming around values and principles to which they are hostile \u2013 but attracting families, entrepreneurs and innovators from all round the US because it is such a delightful place in which to live and work. Who wants to be in neighbourhoods that incorporate the values of Trump-style populists or their first cousins, the Brexiteers, where intolerance and hostility to others are the new normal? One Boulderite told me that after her five-year-old started using Trump\u2019s turns of phrase she now turns off the TV when he appears \u2013 she wants her daughter to be no part of anything he represents. No presidential candidate should say of his woman rival \u201c if she can\u2019t satisfy her husband, what makes her think she can satisfy America\u201d or of a heckler: \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face.\u201d Five-year-olds pick up on such language fast. For Boulder above all is tolerant, the precondition for embracing the new \u2013 the cultural legacy of the hippy colonies who came here in the 60s. It doesn\u2019t regard climate change and concern for the environment as leftwing conspiracies, as Trump says \u201cbullshit, tax and a canard\u201d: it does all it can to make its city liveable \u2013 it was the first US city to levy a carbon tax in 2007. And while there is a vibrant entrepreneurial culture, nobody is so stupid as to think it\u2019s the result of being freed from suffocating government and regulation, as the ultra right insist. Whether it\u2019s the national agencies investigating quantum mechanics, the atmosphere, technology standards or astrophysics, Boulder is living proof of the thesis that wealth is co-created \u2013 between the public and private sectors. There are objections aplenty. Even fully paid-up admirers acknowledge that the place is a bit too pleased with itself. Trump would doubtless dismiss Boulder as the people\u2019s republic, scorning its efforts as political correctness gone mad: these are Bernie Sanders Democrats. Others would argue that too much from which Boulder benefits \u2013 its beauty, its access to one of the great open air wildernesses in the world, its plethora of high-tech public agencies that have attracted so many companies and its counter-cultural legacy \u2013 are all one-offs that can\u2019t be generalised into wider economic and social policies. Boulder itself is worried it is becoming a prisoner of its own success: house prices are soaring, for instance, and how does it ensure that the wealth is shared around? And yet. With so much pessimism that the west\u2019s economic model is broken, with economies bifurcating into a superclass of highly qualified high-tech professionals presiding over the mass of the population whose jobs are being automated and whose real wages are falling, Boulder and many towns like it provide hope that it can be different. The US\u2019s future, no more than Britain\u2019s, is not going to be relaunched on millions of blue-collar jobs in factories, even if Trump extends 500% tariffs to all Chinese manufacturing imports, renegotiates every US trade deal and forcibly repatriates 11 million illegal immigrants. The industrialised world is in the middle of an unprecedented digital revolution that is reinventing the way goods are made and services delivered: blaming the Chinese for \u201craping our country\u201d is not to confront the reality that manufacturing in the future is becoming ever more robotised \u2013 machines making machines. Moreover, as Martin Ford argues in The Rise of the Robots, robotisation is coming to white-collar work too: the thinking computer is in its infancy but already it can figure out standard legal agreements and even write articles in newspapers. Journalists and lawyers are as much at risk as truck drivers and factory workers. To compel Apple to make every iPhone in the US, Trump\u2019s answer to the challenge, is to miss completely the scale and profundity of what is happening . Which is why Sanders has done so well. You can either pull up the drawbridge, build 2,000- mile long walls and blame everything on foreigners \u2013 or try to shape the forces unleashed by digitalisation so they benefit everyone, which requires much more decisive and proactive public intervention than even Hillary Clinton contemplates. After all, there is plenty of wealth and infinite human need to be satisfied: what is required is to ensure the wealth is more evenly distributed. It\u2019s not only the rich who want to eat great food, hike along trails, wear attractive clothes, stretch their minds, stop worrying, live sustainably and not be lonely: it is everyone \u2013 and the jobs of the future lie in meeting these myriad needs. Some will even be done by immigrants. But this requires overhauling the way the US finances its infrastructure and nurtures its people. The country needs to repurpose its companies so they serve great needs rather than hoard $1.7tn in cash overseas. It can\u2019t allow its bridges, damns, tunnels, roads and water systems to decay in front of its eyes for fear of levying the taxes to pay for better. It can\u2019t permit its cities to become hazards to health and wellbeing. It must house its people. Public policy cannot be organised around looking after the interests of plutocrats: wealth creation requires well-funded public agencies alongside repurposed companies, together with consumers with the capacity to express their personal needs. It is time to tax \u2013 and time to spend. Trump will address none of that: Barry Goldwater began a rightwing insurgency 50 years ago. It will be Trump\u2019s destiny to end it. He is opposed to all the good that a city like Boulder represents, and whose success \u2013 with the right national policies \u2013 could be reproduced more widely. In elections, the candidate who can own the future wins. Trump cannot own Boulder, or any of the culture or values that make it what it is. The US may flirt with Trump, but ultimately it will vote for more Boulders. It\u2019s the only possible future.",
