  "body": "Ulrike Lunacek, the vice-president of the European parliament, has called on EU member states to do more to support female and child refugees arriving in Europe and prevent gender-based violence. In a debate on female political leaders\u2019 policies in the face of the growing refugee crisis, Austrian Green MEP Lunacek said the numbers of women and children being displaced from their homes had increased. \u201cA year ago, there were more men, but that has changed,\u201d said Lunacek. By January 2016, UN figures showed women and children accounted for 55% of those reaching Greece to seek asylum in the EU. EU guidelines passed in March state that women and girls seeking asylum have different concerns from men and that women and LGBTI people are subject to specific forms of gender-based persecution.  According to the EU, the most basic facilities put in place to try to prevent gender-based violence \u2013 separate bathrooms and sleeping arrangements for women \u2013 are not being provided in EU reception or transit facilities for refugees. The guidelines state that \u201call asylum policies, including the assessment of asylum claims, should be gender sensitive\u201d, including women\u2019s right to make their own asylum applications. \u201cWomen who travel alone, who are not married, or who are lesbian also need to be taken into account,\u201d said Lunacek, calling on EU member states to prioritise access for women to education and healthcare, as well as ensuring they have safe physical spaces.    Refugees are not a crisis; they are human beings. We have a crisis of solidarity  Ulrike Lunacek     Speaking at the global summit of Women in Parliaments, the independent organisation that campaigns for a greater number and greater influence of women in political life, Lunacek criticised the creation of internal borders within Europe against refugees. \u201cRefugees are not a crisis; they are human beings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a crisis of solidarity, of not living up to our joint responsibility, which should have all 28 member states on board.\u201d On Wednesday, the UK prime minister David Cameron, climbed down over a previous decision not to accept unaccompanied refugee children already in Europe. At the Women in Parliaments summit in Jordan, the president of Malta, Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, called on female political leaders to find a way to deal with the growing numbers of vulnerable people being displaced around the world.  Recent figures from the UN show that 184,678 people have tried to arrive in Europe by sea across the Mediterranean so far this year, 43% of them from Syria. So far, 1,361 people are dead or missing.     Women in Parliaments global summit in Jordan on 5 May 2016. Photograph: Jane Dudman    \u201cIn light of these horrible facts,\u201d said Coleiro Preca, \u201cwe must bring the uniqueness of our position as women leaders to respond to those who argue that borders and fences are the only way to deal with the growing numbers of vulnerable people.\u201d She said governments needed to find policies to promote the resilience and empowerment of vulnerable people. \u00c5sa Regn\u00e9r, Sweden\u2019s minister for children, the elderly and gender equality, said Sweden, a country of 10 million people, had taken in 160,000 refugees last year, two-thirds of them men. But 70,000 of the refugees were children she said, of whom about half were unaccompanied minors, almost all boys. To put that in context, Regn\u00e9r said about 100,000 children were born in Sweden each year. Last November, Sweden announced a sharp reversal of its open-door policy towards people fleeing war and persecution and Regn\u00e9r said that, given the difficulties facing all governments as a result of the large numbers of displaced people, working together would be vital. She also said gender equality should be included in all refugee policies from the start.    Related: 'We need a public education project about what it means to be European'    In December, the Swedish government set up a network of female mediators, to increase the number of Swedish women in international peace processes. It argues that almost half of all peace agreements collapse within five years, but research has shown that women\u2019s participation in peace processes increases the change of agreements being reached and kept to. Kholoud Khatatbeh, a member of the Jordan house of representatives, said this country, with a population of 7 million people, has taken in more than 1.5 million refugees from Syria. \u201cSyrians are automatically included in Jordan\u2019s society,\u201d she said. \u201cOur people have shared their loaf of bread and their school seats.\u201d But Khatatbeh said the situation was putting pressure on the Jordanian economy, already suffering as a result of the world economic crisis and the rise in oil prices, and had changed the demographics of the country.  There were some places, she said, where the numbers of refugees exceeded the indigenous population. Khatatbeh said Jordan was asking the world to help, \u201cbut we have not shirked our duties\u201d.
