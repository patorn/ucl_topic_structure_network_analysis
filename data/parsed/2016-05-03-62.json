  "body": "Parents kept children out of primary schools on Tuesday in a national \u201cstrike\u201d in protest at tougher tests, although the numbers involved appear to have been small. There were scattered protests across England, especially around Newcastle, where the idea for the protest first originated, and in Brighton, where several hundred people gathered in a park to support the day of action. A Whitehall source said the number of children involved may have been as few as 1,000, a small fraction of the more than 1 million state school pupils in years two and six, the groups scheduled to sit new tests of grammar, spelling and punctuation and maths.

Related: Five reasons parents are boycotting primary schools over Sats    \u201cWe had 30 children with us, but we believe another 15 to 20 children were taken off by their parents to go to museums or do other things,\u201d said Theresa Quarmby, who has three children attending the school. \u201cWe had a fantastic time, we went to a local meadow and went pond-dipping and built forts, and had fun in general.\u201d Quarmby said parents with children in year six had already approached the school with concerns about the end-of-year tests when they heard about the national boycott via Facebook. \u201cMy daughter is fairly robust but she has friends who are stressed and are crying themselves to sleep. It\u2019s just wrong and the government isn\u2019t listening. I can\u2019t get my head around how they think this benefits anyone at all,\u201d she said. Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector of schools, came out in support of the government\u2019s position, saying: \u201cThose who oppose this testing need to consider England\u2019s mediocre position in international rankings. \u201cIf by the age of seven a child has not mastered the basic skills of reading, writing and mathematics, the odds will be stacked against them for the rest of their lives. This is especially the case for poorer children. \u201cI understand testing can sometimes be stressful but I am also confident that most schools do everything they can to minimise the stress that children experience in preparing for and sitting these tests.\u201d The children\u2019s laureate, Chris Riddell, told a group of about 500 families in Brighton that allowing children to question government policy was \u201can important lesson\u201d, and he ridiculed the education secretary, Nicky Morgan\u2019s claim that taking part in the strike would harm children\u2019s education. Around 20 people delivered a petition \u2013 which organisers claimed had 40,000 signatures \u2013 to the Department for Education\u2019s head office in Westminster.     Nick Gibb, the schools minister. Photograph: Alastair Johnstone/SWNS.com for the Guardian    Nick Gibb, the education minister closely identified with the new tests, defended the government\u2019s policy, saying: \u201cThere should be no pressure on six- and seven-year-olds taking these tests. These tests have no consequences for the children involved, they are about to holding the schools to account.\u201d Gibb himself failed to correctly answer a question on grammar from the latest key stage two test. The BBC\u2019s Martha Kearney asked him whether the word \u201cafter\u201d in the sentence \u201cI went to the cinema after I\u2019d eaten my dinner\u201d served as a subordinating conjunction or a preposition. Gibb incorrectly identified it as a preposition. David Cameron\u2019s official spokeswoman weighed in over the error, saying: \u201cIt reflected the fact that what we are about is equipping future generations with a better grasp of reading, writing and maths skills.\u201d No 10 said tests in primary schools were \u201cnot a new concept\u201d, and the government had made them more rigorous to reflect the higher standards being taught. \u201cThis is about improving the curriculum, improving the education of our children in schools. It\u2019s part and parcel of how we want to make sure that their child is getting the best education,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman said.",
