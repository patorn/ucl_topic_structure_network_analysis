  "body": "So, voters, an election campaign is upon us and we have a choice about how we approach it. We can swallow the spin and amplify the angry. We can tune out \u2013 which could perhaps be tempting after eight weeks of campaigning. Or we can consider the evidence and think for ourselves. If you\u2019ve ever read this column you won\u2019t be shocked to know I prefer the latter course. Especially this time, when the parties\u2019 slogans and their actual policies are particularly out of whack. According to the government and many columnists and editorial writers, Labor\u2019s election platform is a \u201cclass war\u201d and a \u201cwar on business\u201d. \u201cLabor is setting itself up for a war on business; they are setting themselves up for some kind of class war,\u201d the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said during this week\u2019s budget melee, apparently finding a taste for the kind of slogans he once derided. And, according to Scott Morrison, we are already weary of this conflict, totally over \u201cclass warfare\u201d and the \u201cpolitics of us and them\u201d.   Related: One year in, Richard Di Natale faces first verdict on Greens' new pragmatism    Except, judged on the actual policies we\u2019ve seen so far, the whole \u201cclass war\u201d meme is nonsense. Labor is actually backing the government\u2019s tax cut for everyone earning over $80,000 but continuing on with the much larger \u201cdeficit levy\u201d tax hike on those earning over $180,000, which was due to expire next year. Progressive leaning tax policy, for sure, but hardly class warfare. Nor can shaking up superannuation tax concessions to make them fundamentally fairer be the class war the critics have in mind, because there both major parties are manning the barricades in their own way.  And the \u201cwar on business\u201d can\u2019t refer the crackdown on multinational tax evasion because both major parties are doing that too. So it must Labor\u2019s decision to spend money on education and hospitals and the like rather than extending small business tax cuts to the rest of the corporate world. But surely not giving a corporate tax cut is just a political choice rather than a declaration of mortal combat. The only place class warfare creeps in is in Bill Shorten\u2019s rhetoric, all that talk about \u201cMalcolm\u2019s millionaires\u201d and a budget for \u201cbillionaires not battlers\u201d and all the little gratuitous digs about Goldman Sachs. Because the reality of the Coalition\u2019s policies is a bit more complicated than the slogans, too.  The aforementioned superannuation shake-up is, in fact, likely to upset the very wealthy, who will have to try to seek out other tax advantageous investments. The limit of $1.6m per person in retirement accounts means about 90,000 of them will reportedly have to actually withdraw money they already have socked away. And it\u2019s Labor who are so outraged by this retrospective hit on the wealthy that they are lining up to oppose the measure. Wait ... that doesn\u2019t fit either party\u2019s script.   Related: The Shorten redemption: MPs tunnel their way out of chaotic parliament    And the \u201cdeficit levy\u201d is going but that is exactly what was legislated when Labor voted in favour of it as a temporary measure in 2014. There are some budget policies that could fit the charge \u2013 pausing the indexation of Medicare benefits schedules even further, for example, which Labor and the doctors say will dismantle bulk-billing by stealth. And there are a lot of \u201czombie\u201d Abbott-era policies lurking quietly in the budget\u2019s basement, neither dead and removed from the bottom line, nor a live part of the policies that the government wants to talk about, which makes its cumulative effect regressive, things like the cuts to family tax benefits. And, bizarrely, the government is going to the election without a policy on higher education but rather an \u201coptions paper\u201d, except the 20% cut in university funding remains in place whichever option a re-elected coalition government chooses.  In reality both parties are using similar tax measures to fund different things they hope will achieve higher economic growth \u2013 Labor\u2019s emphasis on spending to reduce inequality and improve education and hospitals and the Coalition\u2019s insistence that company tax cuts are the best recipe. And this is a live debate, upon which opinions differ.  Recently an open letter from 50 prominent Australians, including the former governor of the Reserve Bank Bernie Fraser, respectfully suggested that, since Australia is struggling to pay for things like hospitals and schools, and since inequality is already rising, it might be a bad time to think about cutting the taxes that companies pay. And, as I have written previously, there is an increasing consensus that spending in a way that slows increasing inequality is actually essential for growth and that widening inequality hurts it. I go along with the idea that spending on schools and universities and hospitals and employment programs are economic, as well as social, investments.  But some, like economist Chris Richardson, think the tax cuts are \u201cabsolutely the right policy for the long haul\u201d.   Related: Want to understand budget week? It's all about the election pitches | Lenore Taylor    \u201cCompany tax cuts may be on the nose for voters but those same voters will be the biggest single beneficiaries of the eventual lift in living standards this policy shift brings with it,\u201d he says, and while the $49bn price tag over 10 years sounds big \u201cthat\u2019s pretty cheap given the growth dividend it will eventually deliver\u201d. But he cautions that this \u201cgrowth dividend\u201d could take quite a while, because \u201cthe boost to living standards from those sorts of tax reforms then takes a further decade to fully mature\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s a decade past the decade over which the tax cuts will be delivered. This factual debate is being overshadowed and warped by the slogans, which are all about the politics of the election campaign that will officially start on Sunday. Labor thinks its strategy of painting Turnbull as an out of touch toff pandering to the needs of his millionaire mates is working in poorer outer suburban and regional electorates and the Liberals are convinced that better-off marginals are swinging their way. As ever, the facts are way more useful.",
