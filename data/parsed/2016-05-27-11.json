The miniskirt became a metaphor for the women\u2019s lib movement in the 60s, the slip dress synonymous with subversive sexuality in the 90s, and Roland Mouret\u2019s Galaxy dress became an identifier of mid-noughties celebrity culture. In 2016, the Azaelea dress is acquiring the mantle of the dress for the selfie generation.     The dress of the selfie generation? Photograph: PR image    If that seems like a grand claim, what is not in doubt is that it is shaping up to be the dress of the summer. As a brightly coloured, reasonably priced, catwalk-standard lace dress that suits a range of body types and ages, the Azaelea is the Holy Grail of summer dresses \u2013 something that is reflected in its popularity. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible sales,\u201d says Suzanne Pendlebury, buying manager at MatchesFashion.com. \u201cWe\u2019ve reordered this style across the seasons.\u201d  Made by London-based label Self Portrait, the dress has an instant accessibility. The style \u2013 a sharply cut lace embroidered dress which falls beneath the knee \u2013 has an instantly identifiable classicism, while the silhouette references the 1950s hourglass shape, with the in-bloom skirt and scooped-in waist.  At the same time, it has a dynamism absent from the rest of the high street. Hope Lawrie, a freelance stylist who has worked with TV presenter Caroline Flack, says: \u201cThe laser-cut lace has an edge that the romantic froufrou frills seen elsewhere this summer lack.\u201d     Daisy Lowe in the Azaelea by Self Portrait.   This modern feeling carries over to the fact that the dress looks great under any Instagram filter. \u201cIt is the dress of the season for the selfie generation,\u201d says Lawrie. \u201cIt is easily dressed up with a sexy heel or worn with pointed flats and under a cropped biker jacket for a more tomboy approach.\u201d  Search for #Azaelea on Instagram and you can see its versatility; worn as a wedding or bridesmaid dress or dressed down with a denim jacket. And yet there is an undeniable cross generational appeal to the dress suggested by the range of colours it comes in. \u201cThe colours are feminine in ice cream shades of lemon meringue and strawberry cheesecake,\u201d says Deborah Brett, editor-at-large at Wardrobe Icons, at the same time though the black version of the dress is very Victorian and gothic. Its ubiquity is partly due to its accessible price point: \u00a3240 - expensive for the high street, cheap for the catwalk. Cheaper versions have appeared in shops (\u00a395 from Topshop, \u00a375 from M&S and \u00a320 from Oasis) \u2013 a surefire signifier of its ubiquity. This is a conscious decision by the Malaysian born, St Martins educated designer Han Chong. \u201cBeauty shouldn\u2019t only be an option for the privileged few,\u201d he told Elle. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for me to create something that makes women feel special but that doesn\u2019t break the bank.\u201d     It combines a perfect storm of elements.   This female-friendly focus bleeds into the way it is designed, too. It is both post-body con and post-Kardashian. \u201cIt is flattering, neatly hiding most women\u2019s least favourite part of their body \u2013 their bum and tum,\u201d says Lawrie.  The dress has been popular among fashion It Girls such as Gigi Hadid, Jourdan Dunn and Miranda Kerr, who introduced it to the red carpet. Although the silhouette calls to mind classic outfits worn by Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly, it combines a perfect storm of elements that other dresses lack.  \u201cIt is show-stopping, and features the very of-the-moment midi length, showing just the right amount of skin,\u201d says Lawrie. \u201cIt\u2019s the cool girl\u2019s interpretation of a red carpet dress.\u201d",
