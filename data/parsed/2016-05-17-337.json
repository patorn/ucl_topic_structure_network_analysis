  "body": "China\u2019s Communist party-controlled press has broken its silence on the 50th anniversary of Chairman Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, urging readers to consign the decade of turmoil to the history books and claiming it gifted the country a \u201ccertain immunity\u201d from civil unrest. Beijing almost completely ignored Monday\u2019s anniversary, fearing that any discussion of the party\u2019s responsibility for those disastrous years might undermine its grip on power.    Related: China marks 50 years since Cultural Revolution with silence    No official memorial events were held to remember a period during which up to 2 million lives are thought to have been lost as Red Guards ran riot and the army battled to restore order.  However, on Tuesday, two short editorials in the party-run press did address the previous day\u2019s anniversary. One, published on page four of the party\u2019s mouthpiece newspaper, The People\u2019s Daily, urged citizens to move on from the decade of upheaval, which officially began on 16 May 1966 and ended with Mao\u2019s death in September 1976.       The editorial claimed party leaders had already given a \u201cclear answer\u201d with regards to Mao\u2019s responsibility for the decade of chaos and said it was time to look to the future. \u201cHistory has shown that the Cultural Revolution was utterly wrong, in both theory and practice,\u201d argued the People\u2019s Daily article, which was headlined \u201cLearning lessons from history in order to better move forward\u201d.  A second editorial, published in the state-run Global Times tabloid, said: \u201cThe decade of calamity caused severe damage, leaving permanent pain for many Chinese. Completely denying the values of the Cultural Revolution is not only an understanding throughout the party, but also a stable consensus of the whole of Chinese society,\u201d added the article, entitled \u201cSociety firmly rejects Cultural Revolution\u201d. The Global Times also claimed Mao\u2019s mass mobilisation \u2013 which was designed to help the elderly dictator reassert power over his party but plunged China into virtual civil war \u2013 had in fact bestowed a positive legacy on the country.  \u201cOver the past few years, many developing countries have experienced civil strife, but not China,\u201d the party-run newspaper claimed. \u201cA significant reason is that the lessons the Cultural Revolution taught us has given the nation a certain immunity. Nobody fears turmoil and desires stability more than us.\u201d Qiao Mu, an outspoken journalism professor from Beijing\u2019s Foreign Studies University, said the Communist party\u2019s decision not to address the anniversary until 24 hours after it had passed underlined its discomfort.  \u201cChina had to show its stance but it was worried that if it published something on the exact day it would trigger so-called social disorder or encourage people to reassess the reasons and political basis for the Cultural Revolution,\u201d he said.  While the two editorials punctured the official silence surrounding Monday\u2019s anniversary, they offered no hint that the Communist party was changing its stance on Mao\u2019s calamitous final decade in power. Both articles parroted a 1981 Communist party resolution that conceded the Cultural Revolution had caused \u201cdomestic turmoil and brought catastrophe to the party, the state and the whole people\u201d but skirted over Mao\u2019s central role.

The newspaper said Chinese citizens now needed to look to the future, throw their support behind President Xi Jinping and \u201cunswervingly take the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d. The Global Times said the 1981 evaluation represented \u201cthe authoritative conclusion of the utter denial of Cultural Revolution\u201d. \u201cWe have bid farewell to the Cultural Revolution,\u201d it added. \u201cWe can say it once again today that the Cultural Revolution cannot and will not come back. There is no place for it in today\u2019s China.\u201d In a comment left beneath an online version of the Global Times\u2019 editorial, one reader expressed scepticism that Beijing, which continues to stifle academic research into the Cultural Revolution, might allow its citizens to learn from the country\u2019s history. \u201cAs most information on this half-century-old historic tragedy still remains largely limited and censored, how could present-day Chinese people sincerely learn serious lessons from it?\u201dAdditional reporting by Christy Yao",
