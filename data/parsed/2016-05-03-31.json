Related: Zinedine Zidane expects Real Madrid to suffer against Manchester City | Sid Lowe    Ronaldo has recovered from the thigh injury that ruled him out of the first leg at the Etihad Stadium and Pellegrini admitted that would make it even harder for City to overcome the 10-times European Cup winners and reach their first final. The City manager believes his team might suffer if they place too emphasis on stopping one man. \u201cCristiano will always be a different player,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cHe has scored a lot of goals in his six years here but I don\u2019t think Real Madrid is just Cristiano. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t play, they have other options. If he does, we must cope with it. We must defend and attack as a team, not just against Cristiano but against Real Madrid.\u201d Following the goalless draw in Manchester last Tuesday, City will progress to the final in Milan if they win, or manage a scoring draw, against Zinedine Zidane\u2019s team. Waiting in the final on 28 May at San Siro will be Diego Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, who defeated Bayern Munich on away goals despite losing their second leg 2-1 at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday night. Pellegrini said: \u201cThe pressure is always high in the Bernab\u00e9u so it is important we are focused. But we have the personality, mentality and the football to be able to deal with that. This team have done very well away from home this season and in all my three years. We beat Roma in Rome, Bayern Munich away and we had a very good draw in Paris in the last round. This is a big game for the club and I know how lucky we are because it isn\u2019t every season that you play in the semi-final of the Champions League. It is a special moment for the players and club but the moment will only be really special if we go through. We\u2019re ready for it and we\u2019re looking forward to making history.\u201d Zidane said before City\u2019s arrival that Madrid failing to reach the final would represent a \u201cdisaster\u201d and Pellegrini is hoping that means there will be extra pressure on the home team. He said: \u201cThe Real Madrid history and Manchester City history is very different. For me, it would be a failure only if the team didn\u2019t put in the performance they could. If Madrid overwhelm us we will congratulate them but I hope it will be us going through. \u201cOur motivation is to try to reach a final that we haven\u2019t reached before, playing against a great team like Real Madrid in a beautiful stadium. That motivates me more than anything. We trust ourselves and we hope we can prove it.\u201d",
