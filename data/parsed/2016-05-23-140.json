  "body": "HARD BOILED So farewell then, Louis van Gaal. To paraphrase Vince Lombardi, the Iron Tulip has ended his reign at Manchester United just as he began it: fired with enthusiasm. Departures don\u2019t get much more predictable and yet the manner in which this one is being conducted seems unnecessarily cruel and chaotic ... much like the dismissal of his predecessor. It\u2019s almost as if Louis isn\u2019t entirely the problem and not the only high profile figure at Old Trafford who isn\u2019t up to the job. Now the Fiver doesn\u2019t clamber atop its soapbox with megaphone in hand too often but we\u2019re happy to denounce events at Old Trafford as fairly shabby treatment of an entertaining and eccentric fellow who masterminded an FA Cup final victory just two days ago. And this morning? There he is, packing his things into a cardboard box while reduced, thanks to one dressing room mole, to the status of buffoonish imbecile for the apparently heinous crime of sending underperforming players helpful video clips via email and then taking steps to find out whether or not the lazy sods had actually watched them. (In related news from the Manchester United sieve, it seems Matteo Darmian certainly didn\u2019t pay much attention to this one. Now the Fiver can think of plenty of valid reasons why Manchester United might have wanted to offload Van Gaal, the often excruciating and moribund style of football he forced upon his apparently mutinous charges being the main one. But when a football manager is being ridiculed from within for genuinely trying to improve those under his command, then he really is on a hiding to nothing. For all that, the rumoured \u00a35m pay-off he\u2019ll trouser for doing that particular nothing will almost certainly help soften the blow to his not inconsiderable ego. Reportedly paid \u00a34m just to wait in the wings and ignore other suitors before taking over his old friend\u2019s job is one Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who has been cackling fiendishly through steepled fingers since December. Among those likely to be particularly pleased by Mourinho\u2019s arrival at Manchester United are resident spectres at the feast Sirs Alex Ferguson and Bobby Charlton, who can\u2019t stand the sight of the man but will presumably feel duty-bound to pretend to be pleased by his appointment. Blogging\u2019s Juan Mata is another club employee likely to be unimpressed, having previously been bounced out of Stamford Bridge by his old \u2013 and soon to be new \u2013 boss. Similarly, those United players from the \u201cdelegation\u201d reported to have voiced their misgivings about Mourinho\u2019s appointment are equally unlikely to be pleased with the new appointment, while anyone under the age of 23 with no particular inclination to go on loan to Zulte Waregem or Genk will also be swallowing nervously. Oh yes, even by the standards of a man fabled for his ability to start an argument in an empty room, the levels of friction Mourinho appears to have already caused from boardroom to training ground has been mightily impressive, due in no small part to fevered speculation over the future of Ryan Giggs. Reports from Manchester suggest he will be offered a role \u201cin some capacity\u201d, which covers a multitude of possibilities from giving stadium tours all the way up to a role as one of Mourinho\u2019s inner circle of designated fourth official-botherers. With neither likely to appeal to a man who had his eye on the Big Chair, our money\u2019s on Giggsy severing 29 years worth of ties with United and following Louis out the door. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWhat unfolded on Saturday cannot and must not be put down to exuberance. That is a complete insult to Rangers, our supporters, and those individuals who were intimidated and attacked. Rangers finds it incomprehensible that no one, either from within the Scottish FA or Hibernian Football Club, has condemned Hibernian\u2019s supporters following the violent scenes at the end of [the] Scottish Cup final when Rangers players and members of our backroom staff were physically and verbally assaulted\u201d \u2013 the Pope\u2019s O\u2019Rangers send a sternly worded letter in the direction of the Scottish FA following Hibs\u2019 fans decision to stage an historical reenactment of Scotland fans\u2019 dismantling of Wembley in 1977 after they won the Scottish Cup for the first time since 1902.     Pretty accurate. Photograph: Jeff Holmes/PA    FIVER LETTERS \u201cThe Dark Side wins and Alan Pardew impersonates a young Elvis. Any innocence from my childhood that remained has been nuked\u201d \u2013 JJ Zucal. \u201cCongratulations to Manchester United for seemingly doing the impossible, making us all feel sorry for Louis Van Gaal. They couldn\u2019t even let him enjoy winning the FA Cup for even one hour could they?\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. So, I finally get a letter published in The Fiver, and you give credit, and photo credit to Steven Chicken, after he\u2019d already won the letter o\u2019 the day the previous day. I\u2019ve wasted even more time that I cannot get back after writing this email. But that\u2019s okay, after the upset of Pope\u2019s O\u2019 Rangers losing to Hibs on Saturday, I was treated to watching Iron Maiden in Johannesburg. Pity about the Euros and Copa Am\u00e9rica coming up, with all the cup finals being played, I was hoping the STOP FOOTBALL campaign could get back up and running. Or even better\u2026 STOP THE FIVER!\u201d \u2013 Gavin Simmonds.  \u201cHang on, that wasn\u2019t me that wrote in on Friday. Now it looks like I spent Thursday afternoon ego-googling something I wrote, then writing in complaining that I should have made it easier to find, when in reality I only did the ego-googling.Sorry about that broken link, by the way. Obviously not intentional and I can\u2019t see how to fix it. Ho-hum\u201d \u2013 definitely Steven Chicken. \u201cRe Noble Francis\u2019s postscript (Friday\u2019s letters) suggestion: some of us are the kind of  erudite, sociable and friendly folk  losers who already have Economist accounts\u201d \u2013 Jack Stokes.  Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s prizeless letter o\u2019the day winner is \u2026 JJ Zucal. JOIN GUARDIAN SOULMATES Chances are that if you\u2019re reading this tea-timely football email, you\u2019re almost certainly single. But fear not \u2013 if you\u2019d like to find companionship or love, sign up here to view profiles of the kind of erudite, sociable and friendly folk who would never normally dream of going out with you. And don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s not the rejection that kills you, it\u2019s the hope. BITS AND BOBS Well this is a surprise. Romelu Lukaku would quite like to play football somewhere other than Everton. \u201cWhen things are broken between the manager and the players, it become difficult \u2026 in my head I know where I want to go. You will know when it is concluded,\u201d said his knowing head.     Romelu Lukaku\u2019s head knows. Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP    Mr Roy has no problem with Jamie Vardy skipping England\u2019s match against the Flamin\u2019 Socceroos to get wed. \u201cHe had to cancel his wedding last year when I called him up,\u201d sighed Mr Roy. \u201cSo it was more difficult for me than it would have been otherwise to complain about this week\u2019s date.\u201d Meanwhile, PSG\u2019s 4-2 defeat of Marseille in the French Cup final was overshadowed by safety concerns involving overcrowding and firecrackers being thrown around the Stade de France. \u201cWhen the system was under pressure, it collapsed at a certain number of points,\u201d said a local official.  Chris Coleman has scrawled Chris Coleman all over a contract tying him to the Wales job until the World Cup in 2018.  And Liverpool fans will be delighted to hear that Mario G\u00f6tze has dumped his Mr 15% and committed his future to Bayern Munich. \u201cI look forward to the new season in Munich and will do everything possible to be in top shape for my first training session under Carlo Ancelotti,\u201d he roared.
