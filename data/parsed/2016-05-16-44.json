Related: The Vegetarian by Han Kang review \u2013 an extraordinary story of family fallout    Han, who will share the \u00a350,000 award equally with Smith, took the award for The Vegetarian, a three-part novel described as \u201cconcise, unsettling and beautifully composed\u201d and an \u201cuncanny blend of beauty and horror\u201d by judges. It tells of \u201ca completely ordinary wife\u201d who decides to become a vegetarian as she seeks a more \u201cplant-like\u201d existence. The controversial decision provokes cruelty from her husband and from her father, and obsession from her sister\u2019s husband, as the woman, Yeong-hye, dreams obsessively about becoming a tree. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an outlandish story - a story that could topple over into crude horror or melodrama, or just over-emphatic allegories, but it has extraordinary poise and tact and control,\u201d said chair of judges Boyd Tonkin. \u201cAnd that\u2019s done both by Han Kang and by this amazing translation from Deborah Smith \u2026 The point about this prize is that it\u2019s totally equal between the author and the translator, and we feel this strange and brilliant book has absolutely found the right voice in English.\u201d Smith, who is 28, decided to become an English-Korean translator when she completed her undergraduate degree at the age of 21, and saw the lack of translators in the field. She had not learned any foreign languages before, but moved to Korea to achieve her dream. She has subsequently founded the non-profit publisher Tilted Axis Press, and has translated Han\u2019s novel Human Acts.  At the prize ceremony, held at the Victoria & Albert museum in London on Monday night, Han told the Guardian she felt \u201cextremely honoured\u201d. She added: \u201cIt is a very precious thing \u2013 winning this prize, my friendship with Deborah. This book and this prize has bought me many things.\u201d On stage, the writer, whose next novel will be published in Korea next week, admitted winning a prize for a book she wrote a decade ago felt \u201cvery weird ... I want to share this joy with my family and friends, but they must be fast asleep in Korea right now.\u201d Han, an award-winning and successful author in South Korea, was one of the first authors Smith discovered in Korea.   Related: Han Kang: \u2018Writing about a massacre was a struggle. I\u2019m a person who feels pain when you throw meat on a fire\u2019    \u201cThe thing that kept me interested in it was something you can really tell from Kang\u2019s books: the novels they write in Korea aren\u2019t really similar to those from the US or the UK because in Korea everyone officially debuts by writing short stories,\u201d Smith told the Guardian earlier this year. \u201cYou do a couple of collections, then you move on to doing a novel. The \u2018linked novel\u2019 is regarded as a literary form in its own right.\u201d The Vegetarian was one of 155 books submitted for the Man Booker International, with judges chaired by Tonkin selecting a shortlist which also featured the final novel in Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan series, The Story of a Lost Child, and Orhan Pamuk\u2019s A Strangeness in My Mind. This is the first year the Man Booker International has been awarded to a single book, rather than a body of work, following its merger with the Independent foreign fiction prize. Previous winners of the Man Booker International include Philip Roth, Chinua Achebe and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai. Tonkin called The Vegetarian \u201can unforgettably powerful and original novel that richly deserves to win the Man Booker International prize 2016\u201d. \u201cTold in three voices, from three different perspectives, this concise, unsettling and beautifully composed story traces an ordinary woman\u2019s rejection of all the conventions and assumptions that bind her to her home, family and society,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a style both lyrical and lacerating, it reveals the impact of this great refusal both on the heroine herself and on those around her. This compact, exquisite and disturbing book will linger long in the minds, and maybe the dreams, of its readers. Deborah Smith\u2019s perfectly judged translation matches its uncanny blend of beauty and horror at every turn.\u201d   Related: Translated fiction sells better in the UK than English fiction, research finds    Last week, research conducted on behalf of the prize revealed that the sales of translated fiction in the UK have grown from 1.3m copies in 2001 to 2.5m in 2015 against a falling market. It also showed an \u201coutstanding\u201d increase in sales of translated Korean fiction, up from 88 copies in 2001 to 10,191 in 2015. \u201cKorea has a very strong fiction culture, with lots of good writers and a thriving literary scene. It would be a very good outcome if we saw a bit more of that reflected in this country,\u201d said Tonkin, who was joined on the judging panel by the writers Tahmima Anam and Ruth Padel, and academics David Bellos and Daniel Medin.",
