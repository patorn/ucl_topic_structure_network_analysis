  "body": "This week, the wife of a Republican legislator did something you might find shocking: she wrote about having an abortion. Stephanie Chatfield, who is married to Michigan\u2019s state representative Lee Chatfield, posted on Facebook about ending a pregnancy in high school after she was sexually assaulted at a party. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I desperately wish that I had the courage as a teenage girl to accept and welcome my child into this world,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t, and I made a decision that I\u2019ve thought about and regretted nearly every day since.\u201d Chatfield\u2019s disclosure was certainly brave, and I have sympathy for what is clearly a painful issue for her. But regretting a decision doesn\u2019t mean that no one else should have the right to make it. The truth is that if women\u2019s feelings after abortion were to determine the legality of the procedure, those who want to ban abortion would be sorely disappointed. More than 95% of American women who have had ended a pregnancy aren\u2019t sorry that they did. Enlisting women to talk about the abortions they regret, however, has become a major component in anti-choice strategy \u2013 and part of a broader shift by the movement to seem more woman-friendly than its \u201cmurderer\u201d-screaming counterparts. Founded in 2003, the \u201cSilent No More\u201d campaign encouraged women to hold signs saying \u201cI regret my abortion\u201d and pushed the idea that abortion causes breast cancer (it does not). It\u2019s a tactic that\u2019s moved from activists on the streets to policy-makers on the Hill: In a country that largely opposes overturning Roe v Wade, framing anti-choice legislation as protective of women is a lot more palatable than admitting a law would limit their rights. By placing women\u2019s experiences and feelings at the center, the hope is that the anti-choice message will seem less extreme \u2013 especially now, in the wake of multiple arsons at clinics, sustained harassment of doctors, and a shooting at Planned Parenthood that left three people dead. But there\u2019s no escaping the very real consequences of legislation that limits access to abortion. In addition to curtailing women\u2019s right to medical care, anti-choice policy is being used to arrest pregnant women and imprison women who have had miscarriages. A major study also showed that women who sought out abortions but were unable to obtain them were twice as likely to end up in poverty. And last year, researchers found that somewhere between 100,000 and 240,000 women in Texas \u2013 where abortion restrictions are stark \u2013 have attempted to self-abort. The facts make it clear again and again: denying women reproductive care harms them. Still, it\u2019s hard not to feel for Chatfield \u2013 especially since she suggests that someone was threatening to out her as having had an abortion. It\u2019s understandable to be angry that a person would limit a right that they availed themselves of, but there is never an excuse to leak someone\u2019s medical history. Women\u2019s privacy needs to be protected at all costs, an idea I sincerely hope Chatfield and her husband ponder before supporting more anti-choice legislation. Even though the vast majority of women who have abortions won\u2019t regret them, there will always be some women who wish they didn\u2019t end a pregnancy \u2013 that\u2019s just the reality. But it\u2019s better to regret a decision than never having the option to make it in the first place.",
