  "body": "Alabama\u2019s notorious supreme court chief justice, Roy Moore, has been suspended pending charges that he abused his authority, and he recently called a news conference to identify his enemy. \u201cAmbrosia Starling,\u201d he said, then leaned into the microphone for emphasis. \u201cA transvestite.\u201d The pair have been locked in an ideological war this year that started when Moore ordered the state\u2019s lower judges to ignore the US supreme court\u2019s ruling that legalized gay marriage. Starling headed to the capital, Montgomery, and the fight began: court and corset. Black robes versus a miniskirt. The judge against the drag queen \u2013 and the drag queen is winning. After Starling and companions filed complaints against Moore, the state\u2019s disciplinary board for judges removed Moore from power on May 7, charging he had \u201cflagrantly disregarded and abused his authority\u201d and \u201cabandoned his role\u201d as chief justice. Multiple times in recent days Moore has named Starling as his nemesis and once said, \u201cWhen I started in 2013, if this would\u2019ve happened then, this person and the people around her, or some of the people around her \u2013 him \u2013 would have been said to have a mental disorder.\u201d   Related: Meet the Alabama  judges who refuse to issue marriage licenses \u2013 gay or straight    The two personalities could not be more opposite, or more unexpected. The judge, instead of being known for reserved reflection, is infamous for bombast. And the drag queen, by contrast, speaks with the demure bearing of an Old South debutante. \u201cThis is the \u2018land of the free and the home of the brave\u2019,\u201d Starling said. \u201cBut right now there are people who are free, and others who are brave. I believe we can all be free.\u201d Starling prefers \u201cshe\u201d and speaks with the soft, rounded vowels of someone raised in the wiregrass of south-east Alabama. Her harshest words come when talking about Moore\u2019s professed Christianity. He was removed from the bench once before, in 2003, for refusing the US supreme court\u2019s order to remove the Ten Commandments from his courtroom. \u201cHe shoves hate and fear into God\u2019s mouth,\u201d Starling said. \u201cHe puts the devil\u2019s words on God\u2019s tongue. Very rarely am I met with rudeness or unkindness when I go buy panty hose and I\u2019ve got a beard going, or I go in the Christian donation store to pick out a dress. These people are not as hateful and spiteful as the politicians are pushing them to be.\u201d Starling doesn\u2019t reveal her real name, for fear of reprisal. But she was born and grew up in Dothan, Alabama, where she still lives. It wasn\u2019t an easy upbringing, and Starling found comfort in the kitchen with her grandmother. \u201cI learned to cook, and I learned my manners,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a southern child between ages five and six, you\u2019re going to learn your manners. I was busted three times in one meal for not saying \u2018Please pass the ...\u2019 and I slammed down my fork and crossed my arms. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t like good manners.\u2019 \u201cMy grandmother very calmly put down her fork and looked at me. She said something I\u2019ll never forget: \u2018Manners are free. Around the world, war and bloodshed and chaos begin because someone didn\u2019t have respect for someone else.\u2019\u201d Starling\u2019s first schoolyard fight came when she told a boy: \u201cMind your manners.\u201d It\u2019s a fight that, in her mind, she carries on to this day.  \u201cRoy Moore simply is not using good manners. He is being rude,\u201d she said. \u201cIn his mind the south won the war, and we don\u2019t have to pay any attention to the federal government.\u201d Moore is widely speculated to be aiming for an elected position \u2013 governor or senator \u2013 and if so, shaking his fist at the nation\u2019s government is a time-tested political move in Alabama.  After he ordered probate judges to not issue marriage licenses to gay couples, though, Starling contacted friends about making a trip to Montgomery to protest. They reached out to advocacy groups Equality Wiregrass, Human Rights Campaign and the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cIn no time we had a public address system set up, tables, chairs,\u201d Starling said. She burst out laughing. \u201cif you want to throw a party, just call us!\u201d On arriving in the capital \u2013 in full drag, with a towering wig \u2013 Starling and company realized the system for filing judicial complaints was complex, and required organizations to be represented by attorneys. Individuals, though, could file the lengthy paperwork without a lawyer.  \u201cI said, hey! I know some individuals!\u201d Starling said.  The papers were eight to 10 pages each, and required specific legal claims and notarization, and so forth \u2013 but Starling and 40 friends filed them.  Chris Jimenez-Cherry, head of Equality Wiregrass, said Starling emerged as the natural \u2013 if heavily made-up \u2013 face of the movement. \u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t plan it,\u201d he said. \u201cAmbrosia is just very articulate and free to speak her mind.\u201d Now that Moore\u2019s fate rests in the hands of the disciplinary board, Jimenez-Cherry said the coalition is preparing for the next fight on the Alabama horizon: transgender bathroom rights.  \u201cAlready there are politicians out talking about it, grandstanding for political reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cCorruption in the state is what\u2019s harming the citizens. Not this bathroom business.\u201d Starling agreed.  \u201cThere are bridges falling into the river!\u201d she said. \u201cVeterans healthcare is almost universally underfunded. Our economy is still not good. But don\u2019t pay attention to that. Look, everybody: who\u2019s in that bathroom?\u201d Then she returned to coy decorum.  \u201cIs it shocking for people to see a drag queen get up and call for justice and liberty? Yes. It is,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what\u2019s even more shocking is that a drag queen has to.\u201d",
