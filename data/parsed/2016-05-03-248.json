Related: London mayor: who says Sadiq Khan's fare freeze figures can't add up?    Khan, the Labour candidate bidding to be the first Muslim mayor of London, has repeatedly had to fend off accusations of links to extremism made by the Tory campaign for Zac Goldsmith. In his last speech before Londoners go to the polls on Thursday, Khan outlined his vision for a better London. Contrasting his oft-referenced humble origins with those of the billionaire Goldsmith, he reiterated his pledge to freeze fares on public transport and promised that by 2020 50% of new homes would be genuinely affordable. By contrast, he said, a London led by Goldsmith would see higher rents, more children living in poverty, more rough sleepers and a deterioration in public services.  \u201cI ask Londoners today to choose hope over fear,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to give me the chance to ensure that all Londoners get the opportunities that our city gave to me and my family. So that I can be a mayor for all Londoners.\u201d Khan told reporters afterwards that he had run a positive campaign. He said that when Goldsmith was first chosen as the Tory candidate, he had welcomed the nomination of someone he considered \u201ca nice guy\u201d \u2013 charming, principled and independent-minded.

It\u2019s been negative, it\u2019s been divisive and it\u2019s been increasingly desperate.\u201d Alluding to the notion that Goldsmith\u2019s tactics have been the work of the Australian strategist Lynton Crosby, Khan said: \u201cA good candidate says no [to their advisers].\u201d Introducing Khan, the bookmakers\u2019 favourite, at the Southbank Centre, the Labour MP Harriet Harman said people should \u201cvote to reject the nasty and divisive Tory campaign\u201d. Much of Khan\u2019s speech was given over to housing, ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s Commons vote on the housing bill, which the former lawyer warned would lead to the forced sale of family-sized council homes in London, many to overseas investors and buy-to-let landlords, with no guarantee they would be replaced by genuinely affordable homes.  \u201cThe Tories and Zac Goldsmith do not want to build more genuinely affordable homes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis bill is a disaster for affordable housing in London, and Zac Goldsmith has defended it at every step of the way.\u201d",
