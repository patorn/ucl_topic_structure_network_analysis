  "body": "EastEnders\u2019 Queen Vic is a crowded place and pub-dwelling family the Carters are operating a one-in, one-out policy. Johnny has been accused of plucking his eyebrows while in Italy, but in fact he\u2019s returned with a whole new head. Linda\u2019s little sausage followed his lover Gianluca to warmer climes; now he\u2019s back and, in great soap tradition, no one has noticed he\u2019s being played by a new actor (Sam Strike has been replaced by Ted Reilly). New Johnny\u2019s entrance was well-timed. If he\u2019d turned up five minutes earlier he\u2019d have been at risk of hearing Phil\u2019s daughter Louise belting out Taylor Swift\u2019s Bad Blood at karaoke. She\u2019s only 14, but that\u2019s not too young for a Mitchell to start making trouble, as her attempt at the old five-finger discount on a bottle of the Minute Mart\u2019s finest wine demonstrated. And it turns out that the mysterious Linzi is her school friend, a revelation that ushered in the most unsavoury of storylines, considering Linzi was also Jay\u2019s new squeeze. Sure, he could pass for 12, but ultimately their love affair is as awful as one of those selfie sticks Fat Elvis flogged Martin. Meanwhile, Phil was whining \u201cI neeeeeed a drink\u201d after discovering Abi faked her pregnancy and indeed her miscarriage, which means he hasn\u2019t actually killed his son Ben\u2019s unborn baby. You got that? Keep up, you big melt. Fleeing this daily chaos were athleisure advocate Nancy and strangely lovable charisma vacuum Tamwar, who set off on their round-the-world trip. Nancy\u2019s been sporting a Peru Two bun for years, but what about the rest of her gap year attire? \u201cIt\u2019s like Bear Grylls meets Nicki Minaj,\u201d said Mick. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very strong look.\u201d     Nut job\u2026 Gail\u2019s cake in Coronation Street    Birthdays are a tricky matter in Coronation Street. As Michelle hit 40, Steve was apparently still in Spain, so instead she headed off to ex Will\u2019s bachelor pad dressed like a steaming hotpot of glamour. Who can blame her? Will\u2019s so smooth he still listens to Sade and has a mezzanine level in his flat. You don\u2019t get that at The Rovers. Michelle\u2019s signature move is to roll her eyes at Steve, but now she has such a genuinely sweet flirtation with Will, the only thing rolling is her impressive cleavage. While she was lost in a world of poached salmon and mood lighting, blundering latecomer Steve finally burst into the pub with a straw donkey under his arm, like the anti-Will. Elsewhere, the words \u201cMy pyjamas are stopping on tonight\u201d don\u2019t bode well for Tim, who\u2019s firmly under Councillor Sally\u2019s thumb: she\u2019s threatening to withhold her hot lovin\u2019 if he doesn\u2019t deliver leaflets for her. Sally\u2019s transformation from snobby busybody to the knicker factory\u2019s answer to Hillary Clinton is now complete and she always has one eye on boosting her political profile. That includes ordering a cake from that fancy new bakery for Gail\u2019s surprise party. Sadly, it was delicately iced with the message: \u201cHappy Birthday Gail. No Nuts.\u201d Beautiful stuff. As Shiraz-lipped sage of the Street Carla says: \u201cLife\u2026 just as you\u2019re about getting the hang of it, it\u2019s half over.\u201d     Just one last thing\u2026 Crime-cracker Mercedes in Hollyoaks. Photograph: Lime Pictures    Seven murders in and Hollyoaks\u2019 Gloved Hand Killer is running out of people to pin their crimes on. It takes a brave soul to confront a serial killer, but sleuth Mercedes had no problem engineering a face-off with syringe-happy doctor Lindsey Roscoe. \u201cShe were remorseful all right,\u201d pouted Mercedes, a woman who only has to raise one on-fleek eyebrow to garner a full confession. \u201cRight up until the point she lamped Cindy one with a great work of literature.\u201d Poor Joe had just proposed, unaware that the real father of Lindsey\u2019s unborn child is his brother Freddie. Yes, Freddie who woke up in the boot of Trevor and Grace\u2019s Range Rover after a tussle with Lindsey, and a character who\u2019s clearly too boy band-hot to kill off. \u201cI\u2019ll remember the smell of that boot for the rest of my life,\u201d he trembled, misty-eyed.     Reunited\u2026 Aaron and Robert in Emmerdale    In more romantic news, Emmerdale\u2019s Robron, that couple beloved of soap \u2019shippers everywhere, got a happy ending after Aaron\u2019s dad was banged up for abuse. At least now Robert can concentrate on important things, like being annoyed with the way Aaron slurps his cereal straight from the bowl. Oh, they\u2019ve killed a few people along the way and Robert\u2019s had his fair share of entanglements with the ladies of Hotten, but this is the real deal.",
