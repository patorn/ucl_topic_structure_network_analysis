  "body": "At the Siobhan Davies dance studios this weekend, a cross-disciplinary festival of performances, What Remains \u2026 Anatomy of an Artist: 10 New Works, investigated the different ways in which artists can plunder, reinvent and take colour from the work of others. Writers, film-makers, choreographers and an anonymous sculptor contributed short works about their responses to other works or makers. Some were sketchily experimental, and some \u2013 such as Julie Cunningham\u2019s We Shall See the Sky, danced to the poetry of Kate Tempest \u2013 were a thrilling dialogue between art forms. Anyone who has seen Cunningham dance, and admired her meticulous accuracy and classical grace, might be surprised to see her tackling the ferocious furnace of language, hip-hop rhythms and archaic prosody that characterise the poetry of Tempest. Yet it\u2019s from that absolute contrast of aesthetic that the work\u2019s special beauty develops.     We Shall See the Sky, at the What Remains festival. Photograph: Stephen Wright    Cunningham and her three dancers (two men, one woman) are uniformly dressed in black, and at first their classically stretched limbs, poised balances and precisely graduated shapes seem to occupy a more rarified space than the passionate, full-on delivery of Tempest\u2019s recorded voice. Gradually though, we come to see how Cunningham\u2019s scrupulously sensitive reading of the poems doesn\u2019t limit but amplifies their force. Initially, it\u2019s the choreography\u2019s responses to the rhythm and vocal music that are most striking: moments where the force of Tempest\u2019s quasi-rap delivery sends a current of spiking energy through the dancers\u2019 footwork, or where passages of more melodious lyricism float them on longer phrases of movement. When Tempest\u2019s voice rises in intensity, the four dancers move in more concentrated unison, and the patterns that they form and re-form seem to map out the space in which the poetry\u2019s emotions lie. There are moments, too, of more figurative interpretation. The dancers revolve on the spot as planets spin in the poetry; they touch the floor; they move with softness or with hard resistance; they clench their fists or gently touch each other in response to specific images. When Tempest declares that she feels herself becoming \u201cbigger than all the buildings\u201d, Cunningham stands in a long ecstatic balance, one leg extending upwards, arms reaching out to embrace the world. This sounds more literal on paper than it appears in performance, where over the course of 30 minutes, the dance steadily becomes more deeply and passionately embedded in the choreography. Julie Cunningham is still at a very early stage in her choreographic career, yet We Shall See the Sky is a wonderfully crafted, original work, which could easily expand to a larger stage.   Related: Fred Herko:\u00a0the life and dramatic death of an avant-garde hero    A very different encounter with language comes in Jamie Atherton\u2019s Possibilities for a Pleasant Outing, a \u201cperformance memoir\u201d of dancer Fred Herko who, while almost forgotten now, was once a bright-burning star of the New York avant-garde. Back in the 1960s, Herko\u2019s contemporaries saw him as a man overly blessed with talents \u2013 beautiful, clever, a gifted musician and an even more gifted dancer, who performed in everything from experimental Judson Church events to commercial television. Yet early in his career, Herko became addicted to drugs. A friend once had to rescue him from a downtown diner, where he was dancing crazily on the counter, covered in filth. A few days later, he jumped from the window of a fifth-floor apartment, naked, with the sound of Mozart\u2019s Coronation Mass blaring from the gramophone. Some thought the 28-year-old was hallucinating as he died, imagining the perfect, Nijinskyan leap; others believed this was the \u201csuicide performance\u201d that he\u2019d always promised to dance. Andy Warhol, who was fascinated by Herko, believed it was the latter and was said to have lamented that he hadn\u2019t been present to film it. Warhol did, however, catch him on camera before that, in the 1963 film Roller Skate, in which Herko attempted to dance all over New York on one roller skate. The film is now lost, but Atherton reimagines it in his own 35-minute solo, dressed in the same WMCA Good Guys sweatshirt that Herko wore in the film; executing his own one-skate \u201cdance\u201d while simultaneously reading aloud extracts from memoirs and biography that related to Herko\u2019s life.     Possibilities for a Pleasant Outing by Jamie Atherton. Photograph: Stephen Wright    It\u2019s a curious, chancy little solo. Perhaps in tribute to Warhol\u2019s trademark style of blurring art and life, Atherton makes no effort towards a polished performance. Hunched, wobbling and tense, he scoots aimlessly around the studio, sometimes pausing to balance awkwardly on his one skate, at one point attempting a half-baked imitation of the classical attitude in which Herko glided through New York, his leg gracefully lifted behind him, according to Warhol, his \u201chead lifted\u201d his \u201cthroat free.\u201d Atherton\u2019s vocal delivery is just as casual as his physical style. The material he\u2019s assembled is riveting, portraying Herko\u2019s New York as a place of skuzzy apartments and glamorous parties, of artistic ferment and promiscuous gay sex. Yet Atherton doesn\u2019t attempt to make any kind of theatrical impact with the story \u2013 on the contrary, he stumbles and mumbles his words and occasionally drops the paper he\u2019s reading from. What might seem like wilfully irksome defects in another context, however, make a kind of sense here. Herko was attempting the impossible in Warhol\u2019s film \u2013 towards the end of his marathon performance he was apparently hobbling and bleeding, and his pain was said to have been as interesting to Warhol as his most dancerly flights. Like Warhol too, Herko identified himself with a culture that rejected the polish of high art for the novelty of the pedestrian and raw. And most interestingly, to Atherton, Herko was also part of a gay community whose history remains largely untold, so what\u2019s known about him now has been gleaned from fragments of gossip and anecdote. Atherton\u2019s fragmented, half-achieved solo attempts to honour all these elements. And even though, as a standalone work, it\u2019s too awkward and tenuous to succeed in a theatre, it takes on a convincing resonance in this festival context \u2013 lodged among works exploring parallel ideas, among artists making parallel journeys.",
