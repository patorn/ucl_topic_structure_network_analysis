  "body": "A few generations after their\u00a0forefathers came to this country to work as labourers and then to open restaurants, a new generation of Chinese kids, born into extreme wealth, is arriving on these shores. Well, in London. And a bit in Selby (we\u2019ll come to Selby later). They come because they like it here, and like what they can get. They come over here, buy our luxury goods, pump money into our economy \u2026 they\u2019re Britain\u2019s Billionaire Immigrants (Channel 4). Wendy Yu is one. Poor Wendy. Well, not poor financially, obviously; Wendy is the daughter of the biggest manufacturer of wooden doors in the whole of Asia, and she lives in a luxury flat in Knightsbridge, with her huge collection of designer Barbie dolls. But I am finding it hard not to feel a little bit sorry for her. Wendy tries really hard to do the right thing, and to please her father. She\u2019s not screeching up and down Sloane Street in diamond-encrusted Lamborghinis, she always presents herself in the right way, signs up to the\u00a0London season, goes on courses to learn how to be a lady, how to wear a\u00a0tiara, walk and fire a shotgun with dignity. OK, so she isn\u2019t crowned Debutante of the Year, and her father is\u00a0understandably disappointed about that. But she does invest her money wisely, in online ventures such as China\u2019s answer to Uber, and she is named Young Achiever of the Year. That\u2019s got to make the old man a bit proud, surely? Well, if he is, he \u2013 stereotype alert! \u2013 isn\u2019t showing it. It\u2019s just a very small thing in life\u2019s long journey, he tells her, and she should be more focused on what she is going to achieve. Quite tough, I think, being the\u00a0only daughter of Asia\u2019s biggest door\u00a0manufacturer. Sean, who lives in Mayfair, is from a\u00a0more modest background in China. \u201cThere\u2019s no conflict in being a communist and consuming luxury products,\u201d he explains. Sean deals in jewellery for\u00a0Chinese billionaires, and now he is setting up a concierge business for when they visit London. \u201cIf you want to have dinner with David Beckham, we can organise this,\u201d he tells the chairman of the China Horse Club, Mr Teo. Really Sean? But Mr Teo is more interested in actual royals; can Sean sort that? Of course he can. There you go, ladies, start saving up for a night with Prince Harry \u2013 Sean can sort it. Actually, it\u2019s a Brit who provides most of the LOLs in this. Anthony at Savile Row tailor Henry Poole & Co has\u00a0heard that the Chinese market is one that is worth getting into, but isn\u2019t\u00a0quite sure how to go about it. \u201cFee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of a\u00a0Chinaman \u2026\u201d he begins, then laughs nervously, suddenly realising that might not be the best way to go about it, or to express himself on camera. Anthony is struggling with technology, too \u2013 he has downloaded the WeChat app but doesn\u2019t seem to be making any friends with it. What? You can\u2019t do a post just by shouting at the phone \u2013 you have to type the words in? Poor Anthony, I think he\u2019s struggling with the 21st century, to be honest. There\u2019s something rather nice about the way roles have been reversed, and now the posh English chap is making clothes for young Chinese. Well, he\u2019d like to, if only he could connect with them \u2026 And Selby? Taiwanese popstar Jay Chou filmed a romantic wedding video in the abbey and now everyone else wants to do the same. Selby isn\u2019t complaining. Ker-ching. Kay Mellor\u2019s In the Club (BBC1) is back, for a second series, and a few second babies. My problem with the first series was that all the characters were going through pretty much the same kind of things \u2013 scans, scares, worry etc. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m just not that interested in pregnancies I don\u2019t have some connection with. Maybe Mellor saw this as a potential problem, which is why, interspersed with the antenatal stuff, came sudden moments of high melodrama. Quite fun, if a little implausible. And it\u2019s much the same kind of thing here, though the base-level goings-on include post- as well as antenatal stuff. So it\u2019s about having no libido, and no life, and no sleep, nappies zzzz \u2026 and suddenly here\u2019s an ABANDONED BABY\u00a0in the toilet. And a BIG BARNEY at a christening. And Rosie and Jude are STUCK IN THE LIFT, with baby No\u00a01, and suddenly baby No 2 is on its way. Call it Otis, obviously \u2026 Oh, it\u2019s a\u00a0girl. Schindler?",
