  "body": "What was the first ever record/CD you bought? An LP of Brahms first symphony with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and Marek Janowski. I was 11 or 12 when I went to hear them play it live, and came out of the concert on such a high that I just had to take home the souvenir. What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert? The format itself is fine, but the visual presentation of music could sometimes benefit from a little more thought. I wish we could do away with white tie and tails - it looks a bit silly to me, and it feels cumbersome to wear when you\u2019re playing. I got rid of my tailcoat in 2003, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s still hanging up there in the charity shop.    I wish we could do away with white tie and tails - it looks silly, and it feels cumbersome to wear when you\u2019re playing    What\u2019s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member? Nothing can top hearing my eldest daughter play Away in a Manger on the violin at her school nativity play. She was eight at the time and reduced me to a heap. I\u2019ll have to wait for grandchildren before a live experience of that distinction happens again. What\u2019s your musical guilty pleasure?            Paralyzed, by the Legendary Stardust Cowboy. Isn\u2019t that everybody\u2019s? How do you mostly listen to music? Usually in my head, as long as it\u2019s calm enough in there. I can only really listen to music if there are no distractions, and finding a quiet enough place for that when you\u2019re on the road is not always easy. If I try to listen in the car or on a plane, whatever I\u2019m listening to just turns into background music, which drives me nuts.    I fantasise about walking back on stage at the end of a recital and delivering an encore nobody was expecting.    If you found yourself with six months free to learn a new instrument, what would you choose? The Highland Bagpipes. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to do for decades. I fantasise about walking back on stage at the end of a recital and delivering an encore nobody was expecting. Which conductor or performer of yester-year do you most wish you could have worked with? I\u2019d find it difficult to choose between Carlos Kleiber and Leonard Bernstein.            Is applauding between movements acceptable? Any show of appreciation is more than acceptable! I\u2019d much rather people feel free to show their enthusiasm spontaneously than routinely applaud in the \u201ccorrect\u201d places because they feel obliged to. Having said that, restraint is sometimes a good discipline, especially if you\u2019re someone who can\u2019t resist clapping while the final chord of Beethoven\u2019s last sonata op 111 is still sounding. We\u2019re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why? About a century on from now. I\u2019d be interested to see what\u2019s happening in the music world in 2116, and very curious to know how history had defined what was important about our current era. I\u2019d rather not go back in time - that would just destroy too much mystery! What, in your opinion, is the best new piece written in the past 50 years? Impossible to say, really - but in terms of piano music, the Ligeti Etudes would have to be somewhere near the top of the list. What\u2019s the most overrated classical work? - is there a warhorse whose appeal you really don\u2019t relate to? If I\u2019m allowed to replace the word \u201coverrated\u201d with \u201cworst\u201d, the answer would be a cadenza I wrote about 20 years ago for the last movement of Mozart\u2019s D minor concerto K466. I still occasionally write my own cadenzas, but apply a little more quality control to what gets beyond the end of a pencil these days. It\u2019s late, you\u2019ve had a few beers, you\u2019re in a karaoke bar. What do you choose to sing? I\u2019d rather stick pins in my eyes. Paul Lewis performs at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on 11 May and at the Proms on 18 July. His recording of Brahms\u2019s First Piano concert with Daniel Harding and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra is out now on Harmonia Mundi.",
