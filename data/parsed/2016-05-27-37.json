  "body": "What will the death of Citizen Thiel look like? I picture the tech billionaire lying in seclusion, still beyond the reach of the politicians and military chiefs who had long effectively functioned as his junior personnel, perhaps on one of the post-law, floating sea-steading platforms he\u2019s been dreaming of building. Let\u2019s call this one Xanadu. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s actually dying as we used to understand the term \u2013 maybe he\u2019s just uploading into the cloud.   Related: Billionaire's revenge: Facebook investor Peter Thiel\u2019s nine-year Gawker grudge    A snowglobe \u2013 virtual or otherwise \u2013 falls from his hand as he breathes his final word, a reference to his last happy place, the prelapsarian idyll before his mania for controlling the world and destroying his enemies took over. Where was that? The closet? I hope Peter Thiel\u2019s last word won\u2019t be \u201ccloset\u201d. But first, a flashback. This week it was revealed that the PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member has been secretly funding the wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s sex-tape legal battle against the New York gossip website Gawker, having paid lawyers for years to find lawsuits against Gawker that he could back, with the aim of destroying the company. Whether a gay journalist writing for the Gawker media blog Valleywag should have published a positive item stating Thiel was gay back in 2007, when he was only out to family, friends and colleagues, is a matter of ethical opinion. I hope we can all agree that it is a shame Thiel reportedly still felt the need to keep it on the down-low, for fear of putting off conservative investors. At the time of Citizen Kane, incidentally, some people thought Orson Welles was disgustingly invasive and cruel for the whole Rosebud device, after he mischievously alleged the word was Randolph Hearst\u2019s nickname for his mistress\u2019s clitoris. Gore Vidal maintained that this unconscionable prurience accounted for Hearst\u2019s rage against the movie, and a significant reason he did everything he could to destroy the film\u2019s chances of ever opening. He made threats, he banned mention of all RKO pictures from his papers for a while, he mounted legal bids against it, and he set out to destroy Welles. Yet the passage of time and progress of social liberalism have made that sly Rosebud in-joke seem rather tame, just as \u2013 we might hope \u2013 the passage of time and progress of social liberalism will render the outing plot-point in Thiel\u2019s nine-year secret battle to close down Gawker an ultimately inoffensive period piece.         The Rosebud scene in Orson Welles\u2019 \u2018Citizen Kane\u2019 (1941)    What will endure is an irate billionaire mogul\u2019s ability to potentially close a media organisation he doesn\u2019t like \u2013 for the fantastically cheap (to him) price of $10m in legal fees \u2013 and the mirthless joke of his calling it \u201cphilanthropy\u201d. After years of covert legal trawling, his golden ticket came in the form of Hogan. Thiel has declined to reveal whether he is paying Hogan on top of backing him. But it is hard not to think that Hulk, a man who made his name as a puppet in the plotlines of WWF overlord Vince McMahon, has now graduated to a similar role in a show in which the stakes are slightly higher than a chance to bodyslam The Undertaker. Meanwhile, for all its dress-down Mars colony ideas, the so-called New Establishment has never looked more depressingly like the old establishment. Thiel might disagree with this assessment \u2013 he certainly regards himself as operating under far more tiresome restrictions than turn-of-the-century philanthro-capitalists. Women getting the vote has been a big problem for the advance of libertarian ideals, he once explained. He is against net neutrality, naturally \u2013 indeed, he can scarcely open his mouth without giving Silicon Valley\u2019s endless pleas to \u201cself-govern\u201d the flavour of a dystopian disaster movie. Still, on Thursday it was announced that Palantir, a secretive firm he also co-founded, has won an exclusive contract to provide intelligence analytics software to US Special Operation Command.    For all its dress-down ideas, the so-called New Establishment has never looked more like the old establishment    Yet, to my outsider\u2019s ears at least, men like Thiel are still mostly interviewed in the admiring tones reserved for eccentric inventors, despite the fact they are obviously far more powerful than most politicians and often possessed of rather more chillingly questionable views. \u201cI no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,\u201d Thiel has mentioned. As my former colleague Emily Bell reminded me this week, Silicon Valley is the place where they clap at press conferences; and for rather too long it seemed the primary aim of many technology journalists was to beat Apple to its own press releases. Gawker and its subsidiary sites were providing an irreverence desperately needed in the Valley. It\u2019s fine to view them and various of their editorial decisions with distaste; but people even remotely tempted to sympathise with Thiel\u2019s imperious \u201cphilanthropy\u201d claim should wonder if they\u2019ll apply the same designation when the next angry billionaire follows his lead and sets out to destroy a media outlet they respect. It is certainly possible to imagine, say, a defeated Donald Trump embarking on a round of score settling. Thiel has given him the road map. The reality is that in Thiel\u2019s hands, philanthropy has become one of those words that also means its opposite, like cleave or trim. He is usually credited as the model for the empathy-incapable investor in the sitcom Silicon Valley. But I happened to be watching an episode of it last night in which Thiel\u2019s sensibility seemed most perfectly distilled in another character, the boss of the world\u2019s biggest search engine. \u201cWhy is it,\u201d this guy was screaming at his staff, \u201cthat when I type my own name into my own company search engine, the internet rains shitbolts down on me? I want this to STOP!\u201d   Related: Nick Denton fires back at Peter Thiel over tech billionaire's Gawker crusade    Like many of the loftier web industrialists, you get the feeling that Thiel didn\u2019t invent this thing to be disrespected on it. (And yes, I\u2019m aware he didn\u2019t literally invent the internet.) There is, perhaps, also something of Jack Nicholson\u2019s lawless colonel in A Few Good Men to this man, sneering at the impertinence of Tom Cruise for asking questions. Gawker\u2019s CEO, Nick Denton, wrote an open letter to Thiel on Thursday in which he asked him to debate the issues with him in a public forum. I can only imagine Thiel declining: \u201cI have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it.\u201d It\u2019s turning out to be a funny sort of freedom, isn\u2019t it \u2013 but then, Thiel is a funny sort of libertarian.",
