  "body": "Amazon Prime Preacher This darkly funny and, at times, almost psychedelically odd drama is adapted from Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon\u2019s comics. It stars Dominic Cooper (pictured) as a bad-boy preacher, just about keeping it together in bizarro small-town America. But that\u2019s the very least of it. Preacher also features vampires, exploding holy men, a manic Joseph Gilgun and a kid called Arseface (you\u2019ll understand when you see him). It\u2019s hard to describe \u2013 but in a good way. We\u2019d recommend just watching it. Available now Lucky Louie Very much a portrait of the comedian as a young(er) man but, even so, this sitcom contains many of the embryonic elements that Louis CK would sharpen in his subsequent show Louie. Once again CK plays a lamer, less successful version of himself, but here he\u2019s stuck in the testy domesticity he would escape in Louie. The laugh track gives it a surprisingly traditional feel, but it\u2019s still full of sharply bleak wit.  Available now Vice.com Locked Off Did the illegal rave scene die in the 90s? Maybe, but as traditional clubs close and youngsters get priced out of the kind of lairy fun that used to be their birthright, it\u2019s undergoing a heartening rebirth. This hugely entertaining film goes in search of the new generation of nitrous oxide-huffing, bolt-cutter wielding hedonists and \u2013 from the heart of London to the wilds of Wales \u2013finds that the kids (along with a few old ravers getting 1988 flashbacks) are once again doing their righteously boggle-eyed thing. Available now Netflix Hibana     Hibana on Netflix. Photograph: YD Creation / Netflix    Netflix\u2019s first Japanese original is a comedy-drama following two manzai performers as they stumble around Tokyo attempting to make their name. Manzai is a genre of Japanese standup based on the \u201cfunny man, straight man\u201d premise. That this seems to be an act with two straight men is, of course, part of the wider comedy and also prompts a certain melancholy \u2013 witness their endless polishing of a not particularly funny routine about a parrot for proof of hilarity drifting into longueurs. Available from Thursday BBC iPlayer Hillsborough This gruelling, brilliant documentary feels like the definitive TV take on the 1989 tragedy that turned into a source of national shame, thanks to 27 years of political inaction, police cover- ups and media lies. The film hears from survivors, cops, bereaved families and Phil Scraton, whose book Hillsborough: The Truth is now accepted as the last word on the subject. Unflinching and extremely necessary television from the BBC. Available now All 4 Man vs Nature Just in time for summer, All 4 have collected a series of films about extreme cold. There\u2019s the story of Aron Ralston (127 Hours), who was forced to amputate his own arm to escape from a ravine. There\u2019s the icy nightmare of Touching The Void. There\u2019s The Beckoning Silence, in which Joe Simpson returns to mountaineering. And there\u2019s Walking The Himalayas, in which \u2013 for once \u2013 nothing traumatic happens. Phew.
