Related: Michael O\u2019Neill picks Will Grigg for Northern Ireland Euro 2016 squad    Four years ago, Coleman was omitted from the Ireland squad that made an ill-fated appearance in Poland and Ukraine because the manager at the time, Giovanni Trapattoni, did not trust him. The Italian likes his full-backs to defend first and foremost; Coleman, then 23, always felt the need to bomb forward. Coleman watched Euro 2012 as a fan, at the family home in Donegal. \u201cI had the Ireland shirt on,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t go on holiday and I stayed at home, just like I did before I would meet up [with the squad]. I would have been at the housing estate, with the little kids knocking on the door, just like they were this week, and I would have watched the games with my friends. It didn\u2019t feel nice but, as I\u2019ve said before, that wasn\u2019t Giovanni Trapattoni\u2019s fault.\u201d The image of the local kids knocking on his door is a nice one: \u201cIs Seamus coming out?\u201d But he will not be around now and it is easy to cast him as being on a mission to avenge at the upcoming European Championship in France. These days, Coleman is one of the first names on Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s team-sheet and he has come to know when to hold and when to overlap. Greater maturity has brought balance and there is a confidence about him, in spite of his toils during Everton\u2019s dismal season, when they finished 11th and sacked Roberto Mart\u00ednez. Perhaps there is a liberation on international duty.   Related: Marcus Rashford\u2019s impact on debut is felt by his new England team-mates    Coleman is a part of a tight Irish defence that has kept six clean sheets in 11 matches and a team that are not only difficult to beat but carry a goal threat, particularly at set pieces. It is a recipe for success and Coleman believes that it can be different for them at these finals. In 2012, they lost their three group ties. \u201cWe\u2019re going to France with a completely different mindset,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a hard team to beat and we can score goals. Everyone wants to work hard for each other and a lot of that comes from the manager. He gives us time away from the hotel now and again and we appreciate that. It\u2019s like you want to reward him for how well he is with us. \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone references Leicester City, and what a fairytale that was. Every one of them got back into position and it was a lesson for all the talented teams. There might be more talented players at club level but I\u2019d rather have lads that work hard.\u201d Everton might have more talented players but they unravelled this season. \u201cIf you\u2019re finishing 11th, for a team of Everton\u2019s standards and players, it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cNot many of us can say we kept our standards to what they should be. \u201cIt\u2019s a results business and, unfortunately for Roberto, we hadn\u2019t been getting them. But it\u2019s not just Roberto who takes it on the chin \u2013 that comes from the players as well. It\u2019s not a nice feeling to see someone lose their job and it\u2019s not like anyone was happy about it.\u201d Coleman talked about how his attacking enthusiasm had been curbed under Mart\u00ednez. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t get to bomb on as much as I would have liked but Gerry [Deulofeu] was setting up Rom [Lukaku] week in, week out. You can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019m a team player and it\u2019s a team game.\u201d",
