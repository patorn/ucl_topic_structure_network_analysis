  "body": "Having just turned 40, with three young sons and a mission to change the future for Indigenous business in Australia, Glen Brennan says he is \u201ca man in a rush\u201d. His executive job in Melbourne is a long way from kicking a football as a youngster in Narrabri in northern New South Wales, where he was born and is proud member of the Gomeroi people. But after playing league with the Canberra Raiders and working in sports administration, in 2005 Brennan completed an MBA from Melbourne Business School, wanting to make a real difference.  \u201cI wanted to do work where we could see the potential in Indigenous Australia, not the negative stereotypes,\u201d he says today as head of Indigenous business development for the National Australia Bank.  \u201cAt the heart of what I hope is that we can do this in an honourable business-like way. It\u2019s got to be good for Indigenous Australia and also good for business. \u201cWe see Indigenous business as a source of potential. It\u2019s a real opportunity to back new customers and talented people.\u201d    We have high expectations of Indigenous business and they have high expectations of us and that\u2019s the way it should be.    Brennan is passionate about creating what he calls a \u201cnew deal\u201d of shared value between corporate and Indigenous Australia, one that will be good for his people as well as for business. Shared value is a business initiative that delivers social benefits as well as financial returns. His work has shown him how reciprocity, mutual respect and trust provide the way forward when dealing with the banking needs of Indigenous customers to help them flourish and prosper. \u201cThat\u2019s where the rubber hits the road,\u201d Brennan says. \u201cWe need to see the opportunity. Shared value is the way to engage and to do business with Indigenous Australia.  \u201cThe work is really paving the way to assure corporate Australia that it\u2019s OK to approach Indigenous business from this perspective. It\u2019s not all about philanthropy or cheque book charity. Corporate\u2019s should stick to their knitting and do what they do best. \u201cIt\u2019s a leap of faith \u2013 but no more than we do with any other business. It\u2019s got to be \u2018profitable\u2019.  \u201cWe have high expectations of Indigenous business and they have high expectations of us and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d Brennan says his approach has come from values instilled in him growing up with parents Gerald, a retired builder from Moree, and Delma. As well as football, his family taught him the importance of honour, independence, education and taking personal responsibility for his future. \u201cMy mum and dad told me from my earliest years that I could be whatever I wanted so long as I worked hard,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the deal. They saw the importance of schooling and they had high expectations of their kids.\u201d      While playing with the Raiders, in what Brennan jokingly refers to as \u201ca truly mediocre and erratic\u201d fashion, he became the first in his family to go to university, studying sports administration. His first job was with the Indigenous sports program at the Australian Sports Commission. This led to him meeting and working with the late Indigenous leader Charles Perkins, and gave him the drive to better the deal his people were getting. \u201cWe hit it off from day one,\u201d Brennan says of mentor Perkins. \u201cThere has to be a little bit of chemistry to be really good friends with someone. I think Charlie saw a little bit of himself in me. His networks are my networks now. So when I walk in to a meeting I usually know someone.\u201d Brennan says NAB is already able to offer great products and services and it is essential to address the issues that matter to Indigenous business. \u201cOur micro finance programs in particular resonate with Indigenous organisations \u2013 the banking services and products are bang on,\u201d he says. The work involves providing access to appropriate and tailored advisory, investment and wealth management services \u2013 with a clear market gap to fill for Indigenous business. Brennan says his mission is for NAB to lead the way.  He also works on future-proofing for Indigenous organisations \u2013 helping to invest money from native title settlements for their next generations. \u201cWe want future entrepreneurs to grow. With that in mind we want to help these organisations manage their money and outperform the market and secure the future of their kids. Brennan has also been instrumental in growing various programs in the bank as part of NAB\u2019s Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP), nationally renowned for its strength and impact since its inception in 2008. The strategy is now capitalising on this reputation to develop a series of shared value initiatives to create positive impact for Indigenous people while looking for the business opportunities in this significant market. The four key pillars of the RAP are financial inclusion, Indigenous careers, business partnerships and cultural understanding and leadership. As part of the work, NAB has been a member of the Indigenous organisation Supply Nation, the country\u2019s leader in supplier diversity, since its inception in 2009.  Brennan says he wants his sons \u2013 aged 12, 11 and seven \u2013 to have the best possible future, along with all Indigenous Australians.  \u201cI don\u2019t want another generation of Indigenous kids growing up seeing a bank and thinking that\u2019s where white people work,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to be a CEO you have every opportunity to do that based on talent not race. \u201cIf those kids grow up and in 25 years we\u2019ve gone backwards I would think: \u2018What have we done?\u2019 \u201cMy time in government taught me that government was part of the solution \u2013 but not all of it. The answers are not going to come from government alone. We need new models and new players and not just to go and write a cheque out of sympathy. That just creates more dependency and does nothing to empower people to take control of their own destiny. \u201cThe new deal is where reciprocity reigns supreme. It\u2019s got to be good for Indigenous Australia and also good for business. If ever those two priorities didn\u2019t match up you would find one of the parties walking away.\u201d Whatever comes next for him, Brennan\u2019s ambitious goal is to use shared value to \u201chelp Indigenous businesses to be millionaire factories\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with encouraging Indigenous Australia to accumulate wealth in whatever they choose to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI want Indigenous businesses, Indigenous Australians to be the best we can be.\u201d",
