  "body": "The Obama administration announced on Thursday new rules to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry almost in half \u2013 tackling a powerful climate pollutant in the president\u2019s final months in the White House. The rules, stronger than earlier proposals, are aimed at reducing methane emissions from the US by 40% to 45% over 2012 levels by 2025 by requiring companies to capture gas from oil wells, and find and plug pipeline leaks. America is currently the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer. \u201cWe are really getting at a strong contributor to climate change. We are really getting at a source of toxic emissions that affect public health,\u201d Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told reporters.  However, McCarthy indicated it was now unlikely the administration would have time to put in place rules on nearly 1m existing oil and gas wells and other facilities before Obama leaves office.  The regulations apply only to new and modified oil and gas infrastructures.    Related: US and Canada continue climate alliance with move to curb methane emissions    Even so, administration officials cast the new rules \u2013 which had been in the works for over a year \u2013 as a sign of Obama\u2019s comprehensive plan to fight climate change. Those efforts include the first rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants as well as measures reducing tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. \u201cWe think these are tremendous steps forward to reduce methane emissions. We are going to keep moving forward as this president wants us to do,\u201d McCarthy said. Mark Brownstein, who heads the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund, said curbing methane emissions was an important part of that effort.  The climate pollutant is more than 80 times as warming as carbon dioxide over 20 years, and on its own responsible for about a quarter of global warming to date. \u201cIt means the United States is really doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an important first step in addressing global emissions.\u201d The US and Canada agreed to act jointly to cut methane emissions at a White House meeting in March. \u201cWith the US and Canada you have got the world\u2019s first and fourth producers now committed to addressing this issue,\u201d Brownstein said.  The new rules require companies to put more efforts in detecting and repairing leaks in oil and gas wells, pipeline and other infrastructure \u2013 with quarterly inspection reports. Companies will also have to carry out such inspections at low-producing sites \u2013 a provision that was not in earlier drafts, and was hailed by some campaigners. \u201cThe Obama administration improved the methane rule after facing intense pressure over the weak initial proposal,\u201d Anna Moritz of the Center for Biological Diversity said. \u201cBut there are still some missed opportunities for reducing the oil and gas industry\u2019s massive pollution problem.\u201d The 350.org campaign group welcomed the rules but added: \u201cOne thing remains clear: no amount of regulation can make fracking safe.\u201d The American Petroleum Institute, the main oil and gas lobby, maintained that the industry was plugging leaking wells and pipelines anyway \u2013 and that the new rules would stifle innovation. \u201cImposing a one-size-fits-all scheme on the industry could actually stifle innovation and discourage investment,\u201d the lobby group said in a statement.  The White House admitted the administration had at first underestimated the scale of methane emissions from the thousands of new wells put into production during the fracking boom \u2013 which transformed the US into an energy superpower.  The US has also experienced devastating methane leaks from ageing oil and gas infrastructure \u2013 such as the Aliso Canyon storage site in California. The leak was the single largest source of climate pollution in California last year.",
