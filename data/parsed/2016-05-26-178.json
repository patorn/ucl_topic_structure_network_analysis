  "body": "Truth, justice and the American way \u2026 are all out the window this week, as Marvel comics revealed that Captain America, their stalwart upholder of everything red, white and blue, is a sleeper agent for Hydra: a fascist, terrorist organisation.  In the first issue of Steve Rogers: Captain America \u2013 written by Nick Spencer, with art by Jesus Saiz \u2013 one of Marvel\u2019s best-loved characters, who this year celebrates his 75th year of publication, comes out of the closet as a flag-bearer for his long-time enemies, sending the internet into a mini-maelstrom that could be summed up as a collective: \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d     The cover of Steve Rogers: Captain America #1 by Nick Spencer and Jesus Saiz. Photograph: AP     Here\u2019s a re-Cap (heh) of Captain America\u2019s history: during the second world war, weedy Steve Rogers was given a shot of super soldier serum, turning him into the shield-slinging Captain America. Taking on terrorist group Hydra \u2013 then led by the Nazi Red Skull \u2013 sees Cap frozen in an iceberg for a few decades, until the Avengers defrosted him and he resumed his butt-kicking adventures in the present day. Recently in the comics, Rogers\u2019s super soldier serum wore off, turning him into a grumpy pensioner and forcing his pal Sam Wilson (aka The Falcon) to take over as Captain America. Steve eventually gets his youth back and slips on the ol\u2019 underoos, agreeing to a job-share with Wilson.

In the latest Captain America comic, a series of flashback sequences show Steve as a dirt-poor kid with an abusive father in the 1920s and we see a mysterious woman encourage Steve\u2019s put-upon mother to attend a meeting of a \u201ccivic league\u201d that \u201clooks for ways to help the community\u201d \u2013 the New York Chapter of The Hydra Society. The seeds have been retroactively sown for Steve Rogers\u2019 extreme rightwing tendencies \u2026 effectively chucking out the baby with three-quarters of a century\u2019s worth of red, white and blue bathwater. And the reaction has been \u2026 not great: #SayNoToHydraCap sprang up on Twitter almost immediately, under which thousands of fans vented their rage. Petitions sprung up asking Marvel to reverse the storyline. Writer Spencer has received death threats (\u201cI can\u2019t respond to to 9,000 tweets per second, but if I could, I would say I admire your passion,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday). Even Chris Evans, the actor who plays Captain America in the Marvel movies, was nonplussed.    Hydra?!?!? #sayitaintso\u2014 Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) May 26, 2016    Ever since his creation, fascism has been abhorrent to Captain America \u2013 his very first appearance in 1941 depicted him socking it to Adolf Hitler, after all. This move feels like a bit of a kick to Captain America\u2019s creators, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby \u2013 both of whom were Jewish. When Simon was coming up with the idea for Captain America, it was the villain who came first. Before his death in 2011, he told writer Christopher Irving: \u201cI picked Adolf Hitler as the ideal villain. He had everything that Americans hated, and he was a clown with the funny moustache, yet guys were ready to jump out of planes for him. He was the first choice, and his antagonist would have to be our hero, and we\u2019d put a flag on the guy and have Captain America.\u201d     Detail from the cover of Captain American #1 from March 1941. Photograph: Courtesy of Marvel     But now, it appears Captain America is on Hitler\u2019s side. Still, Marvel is sticking to its guns: one of its editors, Tom Brevoort told Time magazine: \u201cWe try to write comics in 2016 that are about the world and the zeitgeist of 2016, particularly in Captain America. Nick Spencer, the writer, is very politically active. He\u2019s a Capitol Hill-head and following this election very closely. So we can talk about political issues in a metaphoric way. That\u2019s what gives our stories weight and meat to them. Any parallels you have seen to situations real or imagined, living or dead, is probably intentional but metaphorically not literally.\u201d   Related: DC Rebirth: Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman get rebooted \u2026 again     The thing to remember is: nothing is ever set in stone in comics. Characters die and are resurrected with alarming regularity; so much so that comics used to routinely slap \u201cNot a hoax! Not a dream! Not an imaginary tale!\u201d on covers of comics featuring portentous events, as a guarantee to fans that they weren\u2019t going to duck out of the story, Dallas-style (until eventually they\u2019d do just that, with a deus ex machina plot device). What will be the next big revelation in this new Captain America storyline? In the first issue we see Cap\u2019s old enemy (and, as Hydra figurehead, presumably his new best friend) the Red Skull, holding forth at a secret Hydra meeting about America\u2019s culture being \u201cunder siege\u201d and \u201ccriminal trespassers making a mockery of your borders\u201d. So if in a future issue, the Red Skull tears off his mask to reveal Donald Trump underneath \u2026 you read it here first.",
