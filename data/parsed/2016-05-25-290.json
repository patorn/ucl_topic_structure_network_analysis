  "body": "La Trobe has become the first university in Australia to commit to a complete divestment from fossil fuels, the university council endorsing a plan to do so over the next five years. It is a significant win for staff and students who have campaigned for the outcome on campuses around the country. In a statement, the university said: \u201cThe change was in response to suggestions by a group of student and staff passionate about reducing the impact of climate change and lobbied university leaders to change its investment strategy.\u201d Divestment campaigns on campuses in Australia and elsewhere have been led by the activist group 350.org, which welcomed the announcement on Wednesday. \u201cThey have shown other universities that it is possible, and I look forward to other institutions following their lead,\u201d said 350.org\u2019s national campus divestment coordinator, Ray Yoshida.   Related: Staff demand Australian National University finishes divestment from fossil fuels    La Trobe\u2019s vice-chancellor, John Dewar, said the university believed that profitability and sustainability were compatible. \u201cWe are committed to divesting from the top-200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies, ranked by the carbon content of their fossil-fuel reserves, within five years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, we will disclose the carbon exposure of our investments and provide annual reports of our divestment progress over the next five years.\u201d The chief financial officer, Gary Seach, said the university had a relatively small portfolio, and so used a managed fund and wasn\u2019t able to pick-and-choose exactly which companies it invested in. But he said they were working to avoid investment in the top-200 fossil-fuel companies over five years, and the overall aim was complete divestment. By doing that, they hoped to help create a managed fund that was free of fossil fuels. Seach said: \u201cThere is a growing list of like-minded investors who want to make sustainable investments and we look forward to working with them and pooling our funds to help deliver on our commitment to a triple bottom line.\u201d The La Trobe student and \u201cFossil Free\u201d campaigner Michaela Carter said: \u201cWe know that fossil fuels are directly contributing to devastating climate change, so the moral imperative for tertiary institutions to divest is strong. How can universities purport to be future-focussed organisations when their investments are directly funding the climate chaos? Today\u2019s decision vindicates years of work to get the university to take a responsible attitude toward their investment portfolio.\u201d La Trobe\u2019s move follows the move towards partial divestment by the Australian National University in 2014. ANU divested from seven resource companies, selling about $16m worth of shares.  The move attracted a torrent of criticism in editorials in the Australian financial press, and even the country\u2019s treasurer at the time, Joe Hockey, weighed in, describing ANU as \u201cremoved from the reality of what is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment\u201d. In March this year hundreds of academics and other staff at the ANU called on the university to divest completely from fossil fuels, in an open letter addressed to the ANU council. The letter, signed by 450 academics and general staff, commended the university for withstanding pressure from critics, and called on it to divest all its holdings in fossil fuel companies.",
