  "body": "A propaganda campaign run by the British government hid from the public its funding of a London Olympics documentary shown on 15 TV channels and watched by 30 million Muslims worldwide. Journalists who made the documentary also say they were not told about the government funding, a claim denied by officials. One journalist says his life could have been in danger because he was sent to work in two dangerous countries without being told about the government\u2019s involvement. The film \u2013 titled My 2012 Dream and featuring Muslim athletes competing in the London Olympics \u2013 is one of a series commissioned by the campaign aimed at combating Islamic terrorism. The Research Information and Communications Unit (Ricu), a counter-terrorism agency, has outsourced the production of many of these films to Breakthrough Media Network, a communications firm. The film is part of a broader propaganda effort by the Home Office\u2019s Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism, aiming to bring about \u201cbehavioural and attitudinal change\u201d among young British Muslims by producing anti-Isis messaging \u201cat an industrial pace and scale\u201d.

In confidential papers seen by the Guardian, Breakthrough said the documentary was broadcast more than 80 times by channels including al-Jazeera and the British\u00ad-based Islam Channel, \u201creaching an estimated 1 million Muslims in the UK and 30 million globally\u201d. According to the documents, Breakthrough won a contract in 2012 from Ricu to make a film that \u201cchallenged the narrative that the Olympic Games, hosted in London, were un\u00adIslamic due to the event coinciding with the holy month of Ramadan\u201d. Some Islamic extremists were spreading the idea that Muslim athletes would have to discard their obligation to fast during the Games, the documents say, and there was a risk that the Olympics \u201cwould be labelled \u2018un\u00adIslamic\u2019 and used to fuel grievances\u201d. My 2012 Dream\u00ad was targeted at Muslims in the UK via mainstream channels as a means of \u201cdelegitimising the Olympic Games as a target for terrorism\u201d. The film was transmitted in six languages on channels \u201cpopular with our target audience\u201d \u00ad\u2013 young Muslim men who could decide to become jihadis. The documentary followed athletes from Afghanistan and Pakistan as they trained for the Olympics.

One of the film-\u00admakers, who did not wish to be identified, said he interviewed athletes in Afghanistan and Pakistan without being told that the British government was funding the documentary. He said he was furious when he discovered the identity of the funders after returning to Britain. He believes if he had been kidnapped, he could have been killed had it emerged that he and his colleagues were effectively in the pay of the British government. He also said he would not have gone had he known the truth. The film-maker said Breakthrough initially told him that the documentary was commissioned by al-\u00adJazeera. He said he was aware there was an unidentified funder, who he thought did not have a significant role in the documentary. Later, when the film was being edited, he said Breakthrough wanted a stronger emphasis on the importance of the athletes\u2019 religion.     One film-maker said Breakthrough revealed the Foreign Office was funding the film after he resisted changes Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian    The film\u00ad-maker said he resisted what he saw as unjustifiable changes. He felt uncomfortable and wanted to know the identity of the funder. He said Breakthrough disclosed that the money was coming from the Foreign Office, and that the firm had been trying to sell it to al\u00adJazeera. He said: \u201cI went ballistic because they sent me to Afghanistan and Pakistan. I had gone to two places where the risk of kidnap is quite high obviously, and without knowing that the people funding the project were the British government. If I had been kidnapped, and it emerged that I was effectively working for the British government, they would probably have cut my head off.\u201d He asked for an assurance that the government\u2019s involvement would be declared in the credits of the film \u2013 something that did not happen. He also asked for his name to be removed. A fake name, Richard Tyler, was used instead. Another journalist who worked on the documentary said he had no idea it had been funded by the British government until the Guardian contacted him. He said he believed it had been commissioned by Channel 4. The government and Breakthrough acted as though Richard Tyler was a real person when the Guardian asked questions about the documentary. A spokeswoman for Breakthrough said: \u201cMy 2012 Dream was a really exciting project for the company to work on and we\u2019re proud to have produced such an inspiring film. Everyone working on the project, including Richard Tyler, was aware of the government\u2019s involvement.\u201d A government spokesman said: \u201cIt is our firm belief that all those involved with the film were aware throughout that it had public funding and were informed of the specific sources of support in the later stages of the project. \u201cMy 2012 Dream was an uplifting film about the experiences of Muslim athletes from Pakistan and Afghanistan. It was a unique project made at a moment when the eyes of the world were on London and told the inspiring personal stories of individuals competing in the Games.\u201d  Reporting team: Ian Cobain, Alice Ross, Rob Evans, Mona Mahmood, Nick Fielding and Safak Timur",
