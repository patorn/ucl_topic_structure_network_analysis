  "body": "As Les Dawson proved with such precision, any fool can play the piano badly, but it takes real skill to play it brilliantly badly. Similarly, Morecambe and Wise knew that the perfect way to mangle \u201cGrieg\u2019s piano concerto by Grieg\u201d was to play \u201call the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order\u201d. Now, to the august list of superbly maladroit comedic musicians we may add Meryl Streep, who takes centre stage in this very likable, frequently hilarious, yet still poignant tragi-comedy from director Stephen Frears. Streep plays the titular songbird, a New York socialite and eager patron of the arts whose enthusiasm for a good tune is matched only by her inability to sing one. Not that it stops her from trying. Inspired by the \u201cprofound communion\u201d of a performance by soprano Lily Pons, Madame Florence resumes her own singing lessons, her private recitals leading to 78rpm recordings and even an October 1944 concert at Carnegie Hall, which has since passed into legend. The real Florence Foster Jenkins was one of those larger than life characters you just couldn\u2019t make up. No wonder, then, that she has inspired numerous theatrical and cinematic productions. Preparing to play the \u201cdiva of din\u201d on stage in Peter Quilter\u2019s 2005 play Glorious!, Maureen Lipman called her story \u201cone of triumph over embarrassment\u201d, and insisted that one must \u201clearn to sing well before you can sing badly\u201d. Earlier this year, Catherine Frot won a best actress C\u00e9sar for playing a fictionalised version of \u201cthe first lady of the sliding scale\u201d in Marguerite, a film whose central character\u2019s name, \u201cMarguerite Dumont\u201d, alludes to the longstanding comic foil of the Marx Brothers\u2019 movies. Frears himself says that Jenkins \u201creminded me of Margaret Dumont\u2026 just preposterous, but touching at the same time\u201d, an assessment that perfectly sums up both Streep\u2019s performance and the overall tone of Frears\u2019s film.           Florence Foster Jenkins: exclusive clip from Meryl Streep comedy \u2013 video    Working from a screenplay by Nicholas Martin, Florence Foster Jenkins stays fancifully faithful to true events, following Jenkins\u2019s rehearsals with pianist Cosm\u00e9 McMoon in the run-up to the big show, which will fulfil her lifelong ambition. As McMoon, The Big Bang Theory\u2019s Simon Helberg is perfectly cast, an accomplished pianist whose nervous laugh not only echoes Tom Hulce\u2019s cackle in Amadeus, but also weirdly mirrors the shriek with which Streep hits a high C. Hugh Grant is on career-best form as Florence\u2019s partner/manager St Clair Bayfield, a self-proclaimed \u201ceminent actor and monologist\u201d (he has performed Hamlet many times, although sadly \u201cnot as yet in the principal role\u201d) whose recitals provide an appetiser to Jenkins\u2019s own thrillingly bonkers tableaux vivants \u2013 winged set\u00a0pieces mounted for the \u201cVerdi Club\u201d. For years, Bayfield has protected Florence from \u201cthe mockers and scoffers\u201d, soothing her anxieties about the shortage of chives in her potato salad (\u201cunconscionable I know, but they tell me there is a war on\u201d), and ensuring that any criticism of her singing is couched in euphemism (\u201cOne word \u2013 authenticity!\u201d). But when Carnegie Hall looms, so too does the spectre of the \u201choodlum element\u201d, not to mention the New York Post columnist Earl Wilson, superbly thumbnailed by Christian McKay.           Stephen Frears on Florence Foster Jenkins: \u2018Killed by critics! A feeling I know well\u2019    There\u2019s a touch of Woody Allen in Frears\u2019s unfussy handling of the period setting (Liverpool doubling handsomely for 1940s New York), but I was also reminded of Tim Burton\u2019s Ed Wood, another film rooted in affectionate admiration for a much-mocked subject. Just as Wood became celebrated for directing Plan 9 From Outer Space, labelled \u201cthe worst movie ever made\u201d, so Jenkins is called \u201cthe worst goddamn singer in the world\u201d by those who scorn her atonal appeal.   Related: Florence Foster Jenkins: we may laugh, but to be this bad took talent    But Burton evidently loved Wood, and Frears has clearly fallen for Jenkins too. And who wouldn\u2019t? As played by Streep, she is a heroic figure, made physically fragile by syphilis (a wedding gift from her former husband) but strengthened by a love of music which turns a deaf ear to her own shortcomings. Like Streep\u2019s later-life Thatcher in The Iron Lady, Jenkins becomes \u201can eloquent lesson in fidelity and courage\u201d, whatever one may think of her work and legacy. Amid the joy, there are hints that Jenkins\u2019s friends are only in it for the money. In one pointed exchange, David Haig\u2019s ever-so-slightly slimy vocal coach Carlo Edwards conspiratorially tells Bayfield: \u201cShe spoils us all, doesn\u2019t\u00a0she?\u201d But while the more formally adventurous Marguerite posited the absence of a husband\u2019s love as central to its heroine\u2019s madness, Frears\u2019s film affords Grant\u2019s silver fox an air of love and devotion to his \u201cbunny\u201d, even as his extracurricular \u201csport\u201d takes him away from her. At times I found myself wiping away a tear, genuinely moved by their \u201cvery happy world\u201d. More rigorous critics may sneer \u2013 I say \u201cBravo!\u201d",
