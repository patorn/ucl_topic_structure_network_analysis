  "body": "When car dealership boss Iain Harris got the call from David Cameron\u2019s security team that the prime minister was about to call in to buy a used blue Nissan Micra, he thought it was his mates winding him up. Harris, owner of Witney Used Car Centre, said he was asked if he would mind staying open for an extra half an hour on Friday night so the prime minister could look over the secondhand car, which cost \u00a31,495.  He was in two minds, he told the Guardian, in case his friends turned up instead and thought he was gullible. \u201cI thought, well I\u2019ll stay here just in case, because the security guard said they\u2019d arrive at 17.32 and I thought, well, that\u2019s a bit precise,\u201d he said. \u201cNext thing I know, Mr Cameron and his security guards turned up, and I thought, this is actually happening.\u201d The car dealership, based in Minster Lovell, Oxfordshire, specialises in \u201cquality pre-owned cars at affordable prices\u201d.  Harris said he believed Cameron was buying the blue Nissan Micra, which had 92,000 on the clock, for his wife Samantha. \u201cHe looked it over just like any bloke off the street, but not someone with mechanical knowledge,\u201d he said.  \u201cI think he must have seen it on the internet, a British-made car, five-door hatchback, not too expensive, within 10 miles of his constituency. And he found this one.\u201d Harris said he had even joked that the colour of the car was right for Cameron and said he was lucky it was not red, but that was as political as the conversation went. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked him about politics,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to start a political argument with a customer asking them about their political beliefs and they say: \u2018Hold on, I\u2019d rather not buy the car from you\u2019.\u201d Cameron told Harris he would return the next morning to buy the car, and returned to pay just after 10am. \u201cI didn\u2019t give him a discount, he paid the screen price, got the log book, went to the post office to pay the tax and off he went,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I thought, I\u2019ve just sold a car to the prime minister.\u201d Harris said he did not give Cameron any special treatment. \u201cI think his security team thought it was odd I was just treating him like a normal customer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like he was buying a \u00a320,000 car, then it might have been different.\u201d",
