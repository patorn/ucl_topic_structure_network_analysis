S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal told ministers from 170 countries at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi that climate change was linked to conflicts, which in turned caused migration. \u201cClimate change issues lead to conflict, and when we analyse wars and conflicts that have taken place over the last few years we see some are linked to an extent to climate change, drought is linked to food security crises,\u201d she said. \u201cThe difficulty of having access to food resources leads to massive migration, south-south migration [migration within developing countries]. The African continent is particularly hit by this south-south migration.

The Italian navy rescued 550 migrants from the water.  The latest incident served to highlight the flow of people from Syria and North Africa into Europe. The International Organisation for Migration estimates that 39,000 people have been pulled from the sea since the beginning of the year. Royal is not the first high profile public figure to link conflict, migration and climate change. Ahead of the Paris climate summit last year, Prince Charles said that drought exacerbated by climate change had played a role in Syria\u2019s civil war, a claim supported by some researchers. Royal also called on countries to start implementing last year\u2019s historic Paris deal. \u201cThe Paris climate change conference was an important turning point, and today it is your responsibility to contribute towards implementing it,\u201d she said. \u201cActing for the climate is acting at the roots of these [humanitarian] issues.\u201d Uhuru Kenyatta, the Kenyan president, said that Kenya was already tackling emissions through a renewable energy push that includes wind, geothermal, hydro and, in the future, solar power. But he warned: \u201cWe have to be ready and willing to make selfless sacrifices today if we want to leave our children and grandchildren a viable and better world tomorrow.\u201d     S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal (centre right) stands next to Kenya\u2019s president Uhuru Kenyatta in a group photo at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi.

Rachib Firadi, head of international cooperation in the Moroccan environment ministry, said that he wanted to speed up the ratification of the Paris deal, and that adaptation to climate change would be a big focus of the Marrakech summit. \u201cWe have to restore the balance between adaptation and mitigation. We need to take adaptation seriously. We also hope Marrakech [the next summit] will provide some money, some fast start financing, for adaptation for developing countries,\u201d he said. Morocco faced a danger of internal migration because of rising temperatures in its deserts, he said, and its desert peoples should be treated as though they were at the same risk as those on small island states threatened by sea level rises. \u201cThere is a risk of displacement of those people in the desert,\u201d he said. That internal movement of people would be on top of the existing migration from sub-Saharan countries, he said. \u201cYou can see migrants in all Morocco cities right now, and it has a social and economic impact. The government is trying to integrate them, but it\u2019s not easy.\u201d Morocco has ambitious wind and solar power plans, and in February switched on the first phase of what will be the world\u2019s largest concentrated solar power when complete, capable of providing power for 1.1m people.
