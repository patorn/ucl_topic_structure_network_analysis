Brexit explained: industried affected   Speaking to the Guardian, the pro-Brexit minister said a leave vote in the 23 June referendum would free up a \u00a32bn green dividend that could be spent on insurance schemes and incentives for farmers. Environmental laws that have helped protect endangered species and clean up dirty beaches are seen one of the key achievements of the EU, but Eustice sought to reassure green-minded voters that the UK could develop better protections by going it alone.  \u201cThe birds and habitats directives would go,\u201d he said, referring to two key pieces of European environmental law. \u201cA lot of the national directives they instructed us to put in place would stay. But the directives\u2019 framework is so rigid that it is spirit-crushing.

Through the EU we have improved more than 9,000 miles of rivers since 2010 and our water environment is in the healthiest state for 25 years,\u201d he said.     George Eustice, the farming minister.

From tackling harmful chemicals that damage the ozone layer to cracking down on the black-market ivory trade, the UK has a strong track record in driving up environmental standards across Europe.\u201d Environmentalists said they feared a developmental free-for-all on sites shielded by the EU\u2019s Natura 2000 scheme, including Snowdonia, the Lake District, the Thames estuary, the North Yorkshire Moors, Scotland\u2019s Flow Country and Dartmoor. One of the original authors of EU environmental legislation was Stanley Johnson, Boris\u2019s father, who now co-chairs Environmentalists for Europe. He said of Eustice\u2019s proposal: \u201cI am absolutely shocked and horrified at what looks like a no-holds-barred attack by the Brexiteers on an agreed consensus that the environment benefits from a common approach. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that a new Brexit-led British government is going to put environmental regulations at top of its pile on June 24. It is not going to happen.\u201d  The European commission is reviewing the birds and habitats directives \u2013 which define Europe\u2019s conservation strategy \u2013 and is under unprecedented public pressure not to water them down.

Photograph: Environmentalists for Europe    The origin of the \u201cfitness check\u201d lies in a domestic review instigated by George Osborne in 2011, when he told parliament that the \u201cgold-plating\u201d of EU habitat rules was imposing \u201cridiculous costs\u201d on business.  Martin Harper, the conservation director of the RSPB, said: \u201cThese nature directives have been the cornerstone of nature conservation in Europe since coming into force. Not only have they improved the fortunes of threatened species but they are essential if we want to meet our international biodiversity commitments.\u201d   On pesticides, Eustice  said the EU\u2019s precautionary principle needed to be reformed in favour of a US-style risk-based approach, allowing faster authorisation.  \u201cA precautionary approach is the right thing to do but it should be based on realistic assessments of risk and not just theoretical hazards,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the wrong way to go about it.\u201d   The principle has underpinned bans on GM foods, neonicotonoid inseciticides linked to bee colony declines and endocrine disrupting chemicals.    Brexit explained: the cost to UK businesses of EU regulations   The marine strategy directive would also be scrapped, Eustice said. He cited a dispute with Brussels over the UK\u2019s failure to designate protected marine areas for harbour porpoises as an example of over-regulation, when dolphin-repelling electronic devices could have been used on nets instead.  However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society said electronic pingers could already be used under current EU nature laws, which also protect porpoises from trawling, dredging, pile driving and noise from military sonars.   Clive Lewis, the shadow energy and climate change spokesperson, said: \u201cIt is absurd to suggest that Brexit could be good for the environment when the major challenges we face, not least the risk of catastrophic climate change, are international by their nature.\u201d",
