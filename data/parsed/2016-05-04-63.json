  "body": "The government has dropped its mental health champion for schools after she publicly criticised current education policies, in particular the testing regime, which she claims is detrimental to children\u2019s mental health. Natasha Devon was appointed by the government last August to raise awareness of and reduce the stigma surrounding young people\u2019s mental health, as part of a wider \u00a31.25bn drive to improve care. On Wednesday, however, it emerged that the high-profile role had been axed, raising concerns that the government was attempting to silence her. The Department for Education denied this, saying Devon would remain on their mental health steering group, which would be making recommendations in the summer. Supporters said they were not surprised she had been let go as she had become \u201ca thorn in the flesh\u201d of the DfE after speaking out against government policies. Last week, at a conference of headteachers in London, she highlighted the academic pressures facing young people, saying she knew her opinions would not be popular in some circles, but felt she had to be brave and speak out. \u201cTime and time again over recent years young people \u2013 and the people who teach them \u2013 have spoken out about how a rigorous culture of testing and academic pressure is detrimental to their mental health,\u201d she said. \u201cAt one end of the scale we\u2019ve got four-year-olds being tested, at the other end of the scale we\u2019ve got teenagers leaving school and facing the prospect of leaving university with record amounts of debt. Anxiety is the fastest growing illness in under 21s. These things are not a coincidence.\u201d The DfE denied that the axing of the role was connected to Devon\u2019s criticism of government policy, or that she was being silenced, but said it was because a new cross-government mental health champion was being appointed, which made Devon\u2019s role obsolete. Luciana Berger, mental health shadow minister, said Devon had spoken out \u201copenly and honestly about the challenges facing children\u2019s mental health under this Tory government. \u201cIf she has been silenced then this raises serious questions over the government\u2019s commitment to listening to the evidence and acting in the best interests of young people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing.  \u201cMinisters must explain themselves as a matter of urgency. Nicky Morgan [the education secretary] claims to be in \u2018listening mode\u2019 but it would appear that this does not extend to those that do not agree with her.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said Devon had done \u201ca great job of helping us to raise the profile of young people\u2019s mental health since her appointment last year. \u201cSince that time, the independent NHS taskforce report has been published, which recommended that a cross-government mental health champion be created \u2013 for this reason we have had to reconsider the department\u2019s own role. \u201cWe have asked Natasha and others who have been involved in our work to empower schools and young people to promote good mental health to continue to work with us as we prepare to launch our activity later this year.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cNatasha will remain a full member of the DfE\u2019s mental health steering group, which will be making recommendations this summer. Natasha will stay closely involved with all our work.\u201d Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity YoungMinds, said: \u201cWe are very surprised and sad that Natasha\u2019s role as mental health champion has ended. She\u2019s done a superb job of drawing attention to the crucial importance of mental health and wellbeing in schools.\u201d News of Devon\u2019s departure came the day after hundreds of parents chose to keep their children at home on Tuesday in a day of protest against tougher primary school tests, which they claim are causing stress anxiety in schools. But Devon\u2019s criticism went beyond mental health in the classroom. In a column for the Times Educational Supplement she accused the government of engineering \u201ca social climate where it\u2019s really difficult for any young person to enjoy optimal mental health\u201d. She said parents \u201cwork every hour God sends\u201d, which reduces quality family time, while spiralling poverty had pushed a million young people into dependence on food banks. On Wednesday Devon told the Guardian she was assessing her options. \u201cI can confirm that I am no longer authorised to comment as the government\u2019s mental health champion for schools. \u201cThe DfE have extended an opportunity for me to continue working on the peer-to-peer project they were seeking my advice on.\u201d  She was also in talks regarding another offer, adding: \u201cEither way I\u2019m not going anywhere and will continue to campaign for the rights of young people and those who teach them.\u201d While Devon\u2019s role with the government was unpaid to enable her to be completely independent and objective, the new cross-government mental health champion \u2013 which will be advertised shortly \u2013 is expected to be salaried. Appointing her as the first ever mental health champion for schools, education and childcare, minister Sam Gyimah said: \u201cNatasha is an inspiration to many young people and I\u2019m delighted to have her on board as our first mental health champion.\u201d She is the founder the Self-Esteem Team and Body Gossip, organisations that deliver mental health education to young people and visit three schools a week, delivering classes to more than 50,000 teenagers, as well as parents and teachers. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \u201cThe department has got rid of a thorn in its flesh. Natasha has been a completely trenchant and very brave campaigner and advocate for children\u2019s and young people\u2019s mental health. \u201cShe has spoken forcefully about teenage and children\u2019s mental health and she has said really important things. Firstly that resources available for dealing with young people\u2019s mental ill-health are inadequate. \u201cShe has also said that the current government\u2019s \u2013 and previous administration\u2019s \u2013 education policies and the increase in testing have led to an increase in stress and pressure in schools. \u201cThat will have really annoyed the department. I\u2019m not surprised they\u2019ve let her go.\u201d",
