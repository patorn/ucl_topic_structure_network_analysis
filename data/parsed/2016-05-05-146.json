  "body": "One might think the major sources for the history of the Third Reich had all long since been brought to light, but new finds keep turning up. The latest is the diary of Alfred Rosenberg, self-proclaimed chief ideologue of the National Socialist movement and author of its most important pseudo-intellectual text after Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf \u2013 The Myth of the Twentieth Century. Rosenberg was more than just a writer: from 1923 onwards he edited the party\u2019s daily newspaper, and in 1928 he founded and\u00a0ran a crusading organisation, the Fighting League for German Culture, dedicated to rooting out \u201cdegenerate\u201d art, books, plays and other cultural products from the German public scene. During the war he headed up the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Task Force, which began by collecting Jewish artefacts for a projected museum for the study of what he hoped would soon be an extinct race, but quickly graduated to looting artworks, manuscripts and other treasures from Jews sent to the camps. According to the task force itself, bureaucratic in its precision, its loot filled 1,418,000 railway trucks. Following the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Rosenberg was made minister for the occupied eastern territories, in which capacity he put his\u00a0theories of an irreconcilable antagonism between Jews and \u201cAryans\u201d into practice by taking a leading part in the expropriation, imprisonment and murder of the millions of Jews who fell\u00a0into his area of competence. Not surprisingly, after he was captured by allied troops at the end of the war, he was tried for his crimes and executed. While he was in prison, Rosenberg wrote an autobiography, published in 1955, in which, far from showing any sign of remorse, he reasserted his belief\u00a0that \u201cNational Socialism was a European answer to the question of this century \u2026 It was a genuine social world view and an ideal of blood-conditioned cultural purity.\u201d He still believed Hitler was a great man. Taking their cue from this admission, some historians wrote him off as a mere tool of the F\u00fchrer. Others dismissed him as a man without influence, whose ideas were too vague and bombastic to be taken seriously by anyone, least of all Hitler himself, who said that The Myth of the Twentieth Century was \u201cwritten in a style too difficult to understand\u201d. As Ernst Pieper, his first serious biographer, argued in 2005, it was not so much the book as his less pretentious activities as a journalist, speaker and organiser that lent Rosenberg his influence. A Baltic German exiled by the Bolshevik revolution, in the early 20s he played a key role in bringing Hitler round to the belief that Bolshevism was the creation of a Jewish world conspiracy, despite all the evidence to the contrary (including Josef Stalin\u2019s own antisemitism). The regime supported Rosenberg in bringing the Catholic community to heel in the mid-30s. And if the ministry for the east eventually lost out in the struggle for power with Heinrich Himmler\u2019s SS, it was still able to wreak murderous havoc on the populations of the area for which it was responsible. It has long been known that Rosenberg, unlike almost all the other leading Nazis \u2013 men of action in their own minds, not men of words \u2013 kept a diary. Extracts were published in 1956 under the editorship of another Baltic German, the librarian Hans-G\u00fcnther Seraphim. They had found their way from the documentary collection assembled for the Nuremberg trials into the library for which he was responsible at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. But this left unresolved the question of the whereabouts of the rest of the diary. Seraphim knew that it had been taken away by Robert W Kempner, a\u00a0German-Jewish lawyer who had been deprived of his citizenship and exiled by the Nazis, and had returned from the US to play a leading part in the prosecutions at Nuremberg. Believing he was authorised to remove the full diary for research purposes, Kempner took it back to his home in America, intending to publish it or use it as the basis for a book. But he still hadn\u2019t done this by the time he died in 1993, and when researchers for the recently founded US Holocaust Memorial Museum arrived at his house in 1997, they found it had disappeared. Tangled up in disputes over Kempner\u2019s will, the diary had entered the murky world of dealers in Nazi memorabilia, and it took many more years until a\u00a0police raid was able to recover it, leading to its publication in 2015. Now the man who recovered the diary \u2013 Robert Wittman, the FBI\u2019s first full-time art investigator \u2013 has teamed up with the journalist David Kinney, hitherto best known as the author of The Dylanologists: Adventures in the Land of Bob, to write an account of the affair. Neither the sensational title nor the tabloid style in which the book is written succeeds in making the book interesting, not least because the contents of the diaries scarcely justify their description as revealing \u201cthe stolen secrets of the Third Reich\u201d. When taken together with his articles and speeches, the diaries show how unremittingly Rosenberg (who denied this at Nuremberg) drove on the deportation and extermination of the Jews, lending further weight to the argument that the Holocaust was masterminded and prosecuted centrally, rather than evolving through inputs from the periphery of the Nazi machine. The diaries underline Rosenberg\u2019s consistently ideological approach to every question, and bring out his monstrous lack of empathy towards human suffering, including that of the Germans. The almost total destruction of Hamburg by\u00a0allied bombing raids on 31 July and 1\u00a0August 1943, with the loss of 40,000 lives and the flight of over a million people from the stricken city, appeared to him principally as an opportunity for the fulfilment of his \u201cblood and soil\u201d concept of the future \u201cAryan\u201d society \u2013 \u201ca chance as never before for the rediscovery of the rural\u201d, as he put it, \u201ca hint from Fate not to allow the creation of similar world-cities in future\u201d. He continued steadfastly to believe in victory almost to the end, and in Hitler beyond it. There\u2019s no hint of criticism or disillusion, in sharp contrast to the doubts frequently expressed in Joseph Goebbels\u2019 diary. What one does find is ample evidence of the petty and quarrelsome nature of the author, who time and again antagonised his fellow Nazis and undermined his capacity for manoeuvre in the internal power struggles of the regime. Most obvious was his hatred of Goebbels, whose control over the propaganda apparatus he resented and whose private tolerance of modernist art he excoriated, eventually with success. The propaganda minister was ideologically superficial, he ranted, he only played at being a minister. Rosenberg felt he had to rouse people \u201cagainst the poisoning of the party by the vanity of Dr G\u201d. It was all to no avail. Hitler made fun of his \u201cchief ideologue\u201d in private, and Goebbels later won major posts such as plenipotentiary for total war. Overall, Rosenberg emerges from the diaries as weak, vain and petulant, as well as morally blind and indifferent to the suffering he caused. The authors of The Devil\u2019s Diary bring out these qualities well, with a wealth of telling quotation. It is difficult to understand, however, why they are so hostile to the man who kept them under wraps for so long, the prosecutor Kempner. In many ways the book is a parallel biography of the two men, and the authors lose no opportunity to denigrate Kempner\u2019s moral authority, not least by sneering at his complicated private life. It\u2019s as if, for the FBI agent, he was yet another criminal who looted artefacts from Nazi Germany and spent decades concealing them from the authorities. This does not do him justice. For all his\u00a0failings and foibles, Kempner, the German-Jewish scourge of Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg trials, was surely one of history\u2019s heroes. \u2022 Richard J Evans\u2019s The Third Reich in History and Memory is published by Little, Brown.
