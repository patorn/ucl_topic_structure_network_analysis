  "body": "Austria\u2019s social democratic chancellor has resigned suddenly, becoming the first major political victim of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis after accusations from within his own party that he had caved in to rightwing populist demands to build fences on the country\u2019s borders. Werner Faymann, whose Social Democrats (SP\u00d6) suffered heavy losses in the first round of the presidential election last month, had initially taken a sympathetic approach to German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s policy to support newcomers to Europe. But with opinion polls consistently showing that the Freedom party (FP\u00d6), a rightwing populist group whose success is built on anti-immigration views and and fears of Islamisation, was topping the popularity stakes, the 56-year-old did an abrupt U-turn. He joined his coalition partners from the centre-right People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) in deciding to erect fences on Austria\u2019s borders and, working in tandem with Balkan states on the migrant routes, encouraged them to do the same.   Related: Austrian far-right party's triumph in presidential poll could spell turmoil    Faymann\u2019s standing within the party plummeted. At recent May Day celebrations in Vienna, normally a deeply symbolic day for the party which has had a strong position in the city since the end of the second world war, Faymann was booed and jeered, with SP\u00d6 supporters holding up placards demanding his resignation, which he obliged on Monday. Faymann, who had been in office for nearly eight years, admitted at a press conference in the chancellor\u2019s office that he had lost the support of his party and would also be stepping down from his role as head of the SP\u00d6. \u201cThis country needs a chancellor whose party is totally behind them,\u201d Faymann said. \u201cThe government needs a fresh, forceful beginning. Anyone who doesn\u2019t have this support is not up to the job. \u201cA lot is at stake. This is about Austria,\u201d he said, adding he was \u201cvery grateful to have been allowed to serve this country\u201d. His resignation deepens Austria\u2019s domestic political crisis, which came to head last month when neither the SP\u00d6 nor the \u00d6VP, the country\u2019s most established parties, managed to garner even a quarter of the popular vote after the first round of presidential elections, for the first time since 1945. The parties\u2019 poor showings have been put down to anxieties fuelled by the migration crisis, which has led to a rightwing shift. The success of Norbert Hofer of the FP\u00d6 who secured 36.4% in the first round of the presidential vote, only increased the feelings within the SP\u00d6 that by giving in to the FP\u00d6\u2019s demands for tighter border controls, he had boosted their standing. But in his resignation speech, Faymann took the opportunity to defend his controversial decision to end the policy welcoming refugees. In March, Austria imposed a cap on 80 asylum applications a day and erected a fence along part of the border with Slovenia.     Norbert Hofer, of the Freedom party, secured more than 36% in the first round of the presidential vote.

Some within the SP\u00d6 were angry about Faymann\u2019s tough asylum policy, while others objected to his adamant opposition to forming coalitions with the FP\u00d6, whose candidate, Hofer, won the first round of the presidential vote on an anti-Islam and Eurosceptic platform. The minister for the chancellory, Josef Ostermayer, suggested on Saturday that the party could cooperate with the FP\u00d6 on the provincial and municipal level \u2013 where much of the political power is held in federalised Austria \u2013 but keep separate at the national level. \u201cIt could go in this direction: the different levels \u2013 municipalities, provinces \u2013 decide for themselves if cooperation makes sense,\u201d he told the tabloid \u00d6esterreich. While the president of Austria is mainly a ceremonial role, Hofer has threatened to make use of a right to dissolve parliament before the 2018 elections, warning other candidates in a television debate that \u201cyou will be surprised by what can be done [by a president]\u201d. A youthful 45-year-old who is partially paralysed after a paragliding accident, Hofer has campaigned for disability rights and is seen as having lent a friendly face to a party that balances virulently anti-immigration and Eurosceptic messages with leftist stances on welfare issues Faymann\u2019s resignation came two days after hundreds of protesters gathered at the Brenner Pass, on the border between Austria and Italy, to demonstrate against Austria\u2019s crackdown on refugees and asylum seekers. Reinhold Mitterlehner from the \u00d6VP will serve as caretaker chancellor, according to a spokeswoman for President Heinz Fischer, until a parliamentary election is held. The mayor of Vienna, Michael H\u00e4upl, a staunch Faymann supporter, will take over the SP\u00d6 leadership until the next party conference. The second round of the presidential elections will take place on 22 May, when Hofer and Alexander van der Bellen from the Green party will face each other in a tight runoff. Faymann\u2019s resignation is being seen as a further sign of how strong the challenge from the FP\u00d6 has now become and of how divided the established parties are over how to tackle its rise. The FP\u00d6 has existed since 1955, but first came to true prominence in 1986 under its charismatic leader J\u00f6rg Haider who led his party to second place in the 1999 parliamentary elections. The threat of the FP\u00d6 joining government then led to a boycott of Austria by several of its EU partners. Haider died in a car crash in 2008 and some predicted his party would perish with him. But as issues such as migration and the economy have risen in importance, it has found itself surge from strength to strength.",
