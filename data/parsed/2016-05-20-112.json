  "body": "In a writing career that has spanned more than half a century, Thomas Keneally has published more than 30 novels alongside 13 works of non-fiction. Now 80, the prolific Australian shows little sign of slowing down. Napoleon\u2019s Last Island, inspired by a\u00a0museum exhibit Keneally chanced upon in Melbourne, takes him\u00a0to St Helena, the island to which Napoleon was exiled after his defeat at Waterloo. After Elba the British were taking no chances. This outcrop of rock some 1,200 miles off the coast of Africa in the\u00a0middle of the Atlantic Ocean was \u201cthe deepest pocket they could find to\u00a0put the Universal Demon in\u201d. Arrangements were hurriedly made, but on arrival Napoleon\u2019s residence was still under construction. He was billeted temporarily in a summer house at The Briars, home of William Balcombe, superintendent of stores for\u00a0the East India Company. Over the months that followed, Napoleon charmed the Balcombe family, inspiring their deep affection. Thirty years later, the younger of the Balcombe daughters, Betsy, published a journal purportedly written during that time, and it is from these recollections, along with other contemporaneous diaries, that Keneally spins his tale. Though by his own admission he plays somewhat fast and loose with the historical facts, filling the gaps with inventions of his own, the novel seeks to shed light on an afterword of history and so on the Corsican Ogre himself: to tell, in its author\u2019s phrase, \u201cthe truth by telling lies\u201d. Keneally has built much of his fiction on the reworking of real-life historical events, most prominently with the Booker-winning Schindler\u2019s Ark in 1982. His portrait of Oskar Schindler, the flamboyant Nazi industrialist, war profiteer and drunken womaniser who\u00a0provided safe haven for more than\u00a01,000 Jews in his factories, was a\u00a0masterful depiction of a man of deep contradictions. It is not difficult to see\u00a0why he was drawn to the equally paradoxical Bonaparte, the tyrant who\u00a0introduced the enlightened Napoleonic Code, the leader who declared himself emperor in order to save the Republic, the diminutive figure who was both England\u2019s fiercest enemy and an \u201cextraordinary man of destiny\u201d. Written from Betsy\u2019s point of view, Napoleon\u2019s Last Island presents a first-person account of the man by the wayward teenage girl who became his\u00a0\u201cintimate friend and annoyer\u201d. Betsy is\u00a0impetuous, reckless, defiant, a\u00a0girl in\u00a0whom \u201cobduracy was like a disease\u201d. From the start she refuses to\u00a0kowtow to the Universal Demon, attracting his attention and his admiration. A dogged friend and unforgiving critic, Betsy gives us a changeable Boney who is both inexhaustibly curious and quickly bored, an exuberant man prone to depression, a charmer who can laugh at himself but possesses an emperor\u2019s arrogance and self-absorption. An enthusiastic partaker in\u00a0tricks and games, he plays not as an\u00a0adult but \u201cfully as children play, inflicting pain as children do, and with the same fierce intent of children\u201d. Like Betsy, he\u00a0can be cruel. The outspoken Betsy is a terrific character, a force of nature and source of pride and appalled anxiety to her devoted family. But though Napoleon and his entourage increasingly become the centre of her world, the man himself eludes us. Betsy\u2019s age and sex restrict her to the margins. Her perspective is too narrow to accommodate his ambiguities; her girlish preoccupations keep him off stage so that too often his\u00a0character and actions come to us second-hand. While Betsy barrels off the page fully formed, the Great Ogre remains frustratingly opaque. For all the questions Keneally raises about Bonaparte\u2019s complexities, he never quite creates a real man. There are nevertheless some glorious moments in\u00a0this novel, lit with Keneally\u2019s trademark impish humour. He is a magpie, as preternaturally inquisitive as Napoleon himself, and the book has a\u00a0cast of characters to rival Dickens. It\u00a0is\u00a0crammed with detail\u00a0on everything from Napoleon\u2019s S\u00e8vres porcelain to the obscure flora and fauna of St Helena, but it is also much too long. Keneally\u2019s digressive style bogs down the narrative and, like\u00a0many\u00a0real-life diaries, the book suffers from a\u00a0surfeit of the everyday mundanity of living. Not until the arrival on\u00a0the island of Sir Hudson Lowe, the new\u00a0and punitive governor, some 250 pages in, does the story develop real tension. As\u00a0Lowe\u2019s vindictive regime sets Napoleon\u2019s supporters against one\u00a0another, the suffocating smallness of\u00a0the island really begins to\u00a0tell. Only then does it begin to become clear how\u00a0high a price the Balcombes will pay for their friendship with \u201cthe\u00a0small\u00a0man in the boarding house who\u00a0was somehow taller than the\u00a0pyramids\u201d. \u2022 To order Napoleon\u2019s Last Island for \u00a315.19 (RRP \u00a318.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
