In 2008 it was replaced by a limited company with the same core purpose of the original trust: to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity, while its subsidiary aims are to champion its principles and to promote freedom of the press in the UK and elsewhere. Other than to cover expense, The Scott Trust takes no dividend from the Group\u2019s businesses, whose profits are instead reinvested to sustain journalism that is free from commercial or political interference. The Trust Board is chaired by Dame Liz Forgan and currently consists of executives within GMG, external members, a member of the Scott family and a member of Guardian News & Media\u2019s editorial staff.",
