  "body": "For almost 20 years, Lionhead Studios was a beacon of the UK games industry. In a medium where big budgets tend to shrink ambitions, here was a group of experimenters, inventors, and craftspeople who always produced something curious, whether that was creative oddity The Movies or the hugely successful Fable series. Formed in Guildford in 1996, the studio was independent for a decade before Microsoft acquired it. Another decade later, on 31 April 2016, the lights were turned off for the final time. Lionhead made games with big choices, and it was ended by a cruel one. For much of its history, the studio was synonymous with Peter Molyneux, the idiosyncratic game designer who co-founded seminal Guildford studio Bullfrog in the 1990s. There, he oversaw a string of classic sim titles \u2013 Populous, Powermonger, Syndicate, Theme Park \u2013 before selling up to Electronic Arts in 1995. That publisher\u2019s subsequent mishandling of the studio, which would flounder and then close six years later, is a foundation myth of the games industry; a stark cautionary tale on what can happen when big money meets creative genius. Usually, one of the two doesn\u2019t make it out alive. \u201cWhen EA acquired Bullfrog there were, like, 35 people, and within nine months there were 200,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cAnd any feeling of culture and inventiveness was diluted by that. So while at Bullfrog, Mark Webley, Steve Jackson, Paul McLaughlin and myself met in a pub, and decided to start up Lionhead. Indeed, I said I\u2019ll fund it, thinking that at that time it would be maybe be a couple of hundred thousand but actually it was a lot more in the end. And then we set out.\u201d     Black & White Photograph: Lionhead    The idea was to search for a \u201ccrazily inventive\u201d game concept and a small team of 30-35 people who could build it. This loosely conceived ambition became Black & White, an open-world strategy adventure in which the player became a god controlling a society of primitive villagers. The game also featured an adaptive AI \u201ccreature\u201d, which would learn from and reflect the player\u2019s actions. At the time, B&W was the most hotly anticipated game in the world \u2013 think No Man\u2019s Sky \u2013 but a small team and the pioneering nature of the work led to a series of delays. \u201cI can still remember working late one night with [AI design lead] Richard Evans, not entirely sober, when we first got the creature to wake up,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cThe animations and the model were in, and we\u2019d been working on the AI and desires \u2013 and we got the creature to come alive. It felt a little bit like Frankenstein, you know, we were wondering what to do. \u201cThe creature stood up, this magical moment, and one of the strongest desires we\u2019d given him was to find food. The first thing he did was start swiping his arm down through his legs. Of course, we had encoded everything with a food value, including the creature\u2019s body, and so he\u2019d decided his own legs were the most nutritious things available.\u201d B&W\u2019s creature stole the headlines, then and now. Even if the complexity of the AI wasn\u2019t always obvious to players, Lionhead was essentially trying to make a new kind of game. It was experimenting with every facet of the design process. \u201cSome of it even made it in,\u201d says Georg Backer, the network programmer. \u201cThe weather system for B&W looked up where you were and replicated that weather in-game. It had an interface where, if you chose, it could check your emails and have a little villager named after the sender wander up saying \u2018hey email!\u2019 At some point you could even send text messages into and out of B&W, we had it working but then we realised it would be cost-prohibitive to do it on scale and globally, so we didn\u2019t. But we weren\u2019t afraid to try it out and get it working.\u201d B&W\u2019s long-awaited release in 2001 saw the development time vindicated with great reviews and enormous sales \u2013 a level of success that, over the next few years, Lionhead would struggle to cope with. \u201cIt was an unmitigated disaster,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t chaos, it was worse than chaos. The compressed version of what happened is that we made B&W, it was a huge success, and we were very happy. And what we did was we listened to some financial advisers who told us absolutely that if we didn\u2019t float on the stock market our company was going to die.\u201d  The founders agreed to go for the public listing. \u201cThe most stupid thing that ever happened,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cBecause when you go for an IPO what happens is, these advisers go \u2018you can\u2019t just have 30 people, go and hire more; you can\u2019t have just one product, you need three or four.\u2019 And that\u2019s where the Movies comes from, that\u2019s actually why we got so distracted, because there was all this corporate stuff going on, it was just insanity.\u201d Post-2001, Lionhead expanded rapidly and worked across several projects, but the stock market listing wasn\u2019t happening and \u2013 having staffed-up in order to look more attractive \u2013 the founders instead turned to private investors in order to complete the games without going under. Three of the projects would see release \u2013 Fable (2004), B&W2 (2005), and The Movies (2005) \u2013 while others like BC and Unity disappeared.     Fable Photograph: Lionhead    Fable became synonymous with Lionhead, and would dominate the studio\u2019s later years, but it began elsewhere. Big Blue Box Studios was another group of Bullfrog veterans setting up anew in Guildford. \u201cIt was the result of a desire to leave EA and the sadly ravaged corpse of Bullfrog it had left behind,\u201d says co-founder Dene Carter. \u201cMy brother Simon, Ian Lovett and I were desperate to do something by ourselves, away from a big corporate structure, and hopefully recreate some of the magic we\u2019d seen dissipated by the takeover.\u201d Funded by Lionhead, the small team at Big Blue Box began building a new kind of role-playing game. \u201cFable was always about three things,\u201d says Dene Carter. \u201cFairytales rather than fantasy, humour rather than pomposity, [and] accessibility rather than byzantine complexity.\u201d But after four years of development the scope had grown beyond what a small team could handle and, after Lionhead\u2019s acquisition of Big Blue Box as part of the finance dance, the Xbox-exclusive was brought in-house. Resources are great, of course, but have their downsides. \u201cI remember a ludicrous focus group in Staines,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWhere one of the group said \u2018Why\u2019s it set in, like, \u2018istory, and not, like, space?\u2019\u201d Thanks to a brutal crunch period, Fable was eventually finished \u2013 and was not only something interesting and new and fun, but the commercial success Lionhead needed. B&W2 and The Movies were not, however, progressing so smoothly. The Movies was an idea ahead of its time \u2013 allowing players to build, direct, and share their own animated motion pictures using a huge library of assets and characters \u2013 but without the execution to match. Perhaps the most forward-thinking feature, around a year before Youtube existed, was The Movies Online, a website hosting user videos. \u201cThat was the thing, we had a conversation back then thinking \u2018surely people will want to share these movies,\u2019\u201d says Georg Backer. \u201cAnd it was like, yep, let\u2019s just build it. Whatever you need Georg.\u201d     The Movies Photograph: Lionhead    Despite this, the Movies was \u201ca disaster\u201d according to Molyneux, who attributes this to a lack of focused playtesting. Still, at least it was released. \u201cThe Movies nearly didn\u2019t ship because there was a massive concern raised by Activision lawyers which internally we called \u2018pantygate,\u2019\u201d says Stuart Whyte. \u201cThere was some gouraud shading around the character models\u2019 legs, which looked like pubic hair.\u201d Subsequently, female models with white or pink underwear could be perceived as having transparent pants. The Movies was only teen-rated and the recent Hot Coffee scandal involving GTA: San Andreas (which saw publisher Rockstar sued by the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office) loomed large. \u201cFrom memory, the first 300,000 disks of the game had to be destroyed at the factory and an emergency patch created,\u201d says Whyte. \u201cIt meant that the poor lead character artist and the lead producer and the head lawyer of Activision were looking through hundreds of screenshots of various actresses to try and see if there was anything that could be salvaged. I believe that\u2019s why, in the final version, everyone was wearing black underwear.\u201d At this time Lionhead employed more than 300 people (Eurogamer has an excellent article on the working culture at the company). \u201cThe studio was getting so large it felt like an entity,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cMicrosoft was interested, Ubisoft was, and also I think people wanted the safety and security of being part of something bigger.\u201d Microsoft had a good working relationship with Lionhead during Fable\u2019s development, and it won the day \u2013 acquiring the studio in April 2006, almost exactly 10 years before it would close.  The first game Lionhead made as a Microsoft first-party studio is what many consider its finest work: Fable 2. Many of its innovations, though, were a target of scorn before people got their hands on it. The game introduced a one-button combat system, and removed player death from the game entirely. They\u2019re not big sexy groundbreaking ideas, but they rank among the studio\u2019s most pure gaming insights, sitting alongside the fact that the Fable 2 world is simply a joy to play in.     Fable 2 Photograph: Lionhead    Only Kinect It was post-Fable 2 that something seemed to change at Lionhead. Fable 3 was developed in only eighteen months, and unsurprisingly felt rushed and lacked the magic of its predecessor. Certain heads had also been turned from Fable by a new Microsoft technology. \u201cWay before Kinect was ever public they asked for my take on it,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cI saw the device and the way it was sold to me was that you could be in a room with lots of other people, and this device can pick you out, it knows it\u2019s you, it will recognise your voice, your gestures, finger movements, the whole shebang. My first reaction to seeing that early tech was thinking that the last thing you\u2019d want to do with it is make a first-person shooter.\u201d Instead, Molyneux thought of Dmitri, one of Lionhead\u2019s experimental \u2018see where it goes\u2019 projects that, since B&W\u2019s release in 2001, had existed in various (very different) forms. \u201cAt this time my son was seven or eight, and all parents find this, when your kid is that age it\u2019s just amazing being a parent. You can see you\u2019re inspiring this little person that looks at you and you can feel the wonder in their eyes, and that to me just felt incredible.\u201d Project Dmitri became Milo & Kate, a game about interacting with and talking to a child \u2013 who would \u201crecognise\u201d you, \u201cremember\u201d you, and \u201clearn\u201d from you.       Milo made a sensational debut during Microsoft\u2019s E3 2009 stage show, in a pre-recorded presentation that showed the boy recognising a human player, \u2018taking\u2019 a drawing from her through the Kinect scanner before commenting upon it, and holding a plausible conversation. Even at the time people wondered how much smoke and mirrors was involved, but the technology behind Milo was real if limited \u2013 players who tried to break it could do so easily, but those willing to accommodate its quirks were rewarded. Many at Lionhead wondered if Milo would make for a coherent and fun experience, sure, but this is pretty standard for a partially complete game. The problem was, to many observers, the demo felt like a lot of interesting jigsaw pictures that didn\u2019t quite seem to make a whole picture. \u201cThe nail in the coffin for Milo was that the marketing people saw Kinect as a party device, about having fun, about being better than Wii Tennis, and Milo just didn\u2019t fit into that picture,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cThe trouble is, they call Redmond the mothership, and that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like. If you\u2019re not in the mothership they completely forget about you. I saw the writing on the wall, they were committing to Kinect, I mean serious amounts of money, scary money, and y\u2019know when they took the decision to make it a party device I started thinking \u2018oh God, this is going to be tough.\u2019\u201d Milo was cancelled in a drawn-out manner over 2010-11, with Molyneux clearly going out of his way to sell the game in public \u2013 including giving a TED talk about it \u2013 while Microsoft backed away. The studio had begun to change internally, reflecting Microsoft\u2019s perception of wider industry trends, and after a spate of senior resignations in early 2012, Molyneux also left Lionhead later in the year.     Fable: The Journey Photograph: Lionhead    Some of Milo was re-purposed for Fable: The Journey, a Kinect-focused side-entry that took the player on a horse-mounted adventure. \u201cWeirdly my fondest memories are of finishing Fable: The Journey,\u201d says designer Ben Brooks. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say my best moments were on Lionhead\u2019s motion-controlled horse simulator but it was like... Peter\u2019s gone, we\u2019re making a Kinect game and the tide has turned against Kinect a bit and people were maybe looking at us a little askance. \u201cAnd actually, the team really pulled together amidst that and there was a great sense of camaraderie about finishing that thing off. I\u2019ve often referred to it as the best seated core Kinect game-slash-horse simulator that\u2019s out there. There was a time I think at Gamescom 2013 when someone came to the Fable Anniversary booth, and said \u2018Fable the horse is my favourite Fable\u2019 And that\u2019s lovely. So as a developer you can want millions of people to buy and love what you\u2019ve made, but as long as a couple of people really get it and enjoy it\u2026 that can do.\u201d Fable Anniversary (2014), a warmly-received HD remake of Fable: The Lost Chapters, would end up being Lionhead\u2019s final full release. This was not least because Microsoft didn\u2019t want any more \u2018normal\u2019 Fable games. \u201cFable Legends got concepted then greenlit in around July-August 2012 time,\u201d says Stuart Whyte. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there at that point, but certainly talking to the studio head Mark Webley they tried to pitch Fable 4 and were very much told that if it isn\u2019t GaaS [games-as-a-service] it isn\u2019t gonna fly \u2013 we need to pivot to support that.\u201d In other words, Microsoft didn\u2019t want another self-contained, single-player-focused adventure. It wanted something that could be expanded with downloadable content, something social, that it could build a longer revenue stream around. The resulting project was Fable Legends, designed for five players: four acting co-operatively as heroes raiding a dungeon, one playing as the villain, exerting control over all the enemy forces. The idea was to provide a more traditional Fable combat experience for the co-operators and an RTS-style of play for the baddie. David Eckelberry, who had experience from D&D Online and LOTR Online, was hired as lead designer, one of many new additions as the studio began to staff appropriately for the GaaS future. Fable Legends had a closed beta from late 2015 until mid-April and according to Eckelberry, it was effectively finished. \u201cIn software definition terms we were truly there by the end of the closed beta, basically content complete,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had a few bits more that we wanted to finish in terms of the 15-part story arc, but there are two bits of that the world will never see.\u201d This is because, after an enormous investment that a senior source claims was \u201cat least $75 million,\u201d Microsoft not only closed Lionhead but cancelled Fable: Legends. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy to me, no offense to Microsoft or anyone else, but...\u201d Eckelberry trails off for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on incubation teams before where you work on projects for a few weeks or months and then end up killing them for all kinds of reasons. I\u2019ve never seen a project go on for three-and-a-half years then be killed, not with these production values.\u201d     Fable Legends Photograph: Lionhead    There are any number of possible reasons for Fable Legends\u2019 cancellation, and the wider closure of Lionhead, but Occam\u2019s razor points to the sales failure of the Xbox One hardware \u2013 there simply isn\u2019t the installed base to support this kind of game, which depends on volume of players. \u201cSo the leadership team, which I was on, was told on the morning before the announcement was made to the studio,\u201d says Stuart Whyte. The date was 7 March 2016. \u201cThe announcement was made to the studio at about the same time it was announced to the press, and that was to ensure there were no leaks or whatever. It was very much a surprise. We weren\u2019t expecting it. Maybe the idea of there being some redundancies because we were coming to the end of Fable Legends... we were starting to think about concepting on our next title which was actually going to be Fable 4, we had a pitch around that. We all found out that morning.\u201d \u201cThey were fairly clear with us about what was happening,\u201d says Ben Brooks. \u201cI mean, legally, you can\u2019t just chuck everybody out, you have to go this process of making sure it\u2019s the right thing to do. I think once that process started we were all fairly clear about where it was going, and there was no attempt to disguise that.\u201d The only lingering sore point is that, while Microsoft wasn\u2019t prepared to back Lionhead in creating Fable 4, it wouldn\u2019t let Fable go either. Several sources say that during the consultation period there were potential buyers for Lionhead, but Microsoft\u2019s insistence that it retain the rights to Fable was a deal-breaker. A group of Lionhead employees tried to salvage Fable Legends, too, attempting to secure funding in order to run the game under license from Microsoft (who at this point had already written-off the cost of development.) \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating in hindsight,\u201d says one of those involved. \u201cThe team was trying to see if we could salvage anything from the ashes, and we heard Sony had given the Evolution management a bit of a heads-up as to what their intentions were [the Evolution team was hired by Codemasters shortly after Sony closed the studio]. Maybe if we\u2019d had the same it could\u2019ve ended differently, but there you are.\u201d The lion sleeps \u201cThere were a number of us at Lionhead who started in work-experience and rose up through the ranks,\u201d says Ted Timmins, who began in QA and worked on every Fable game before directing Fable Anniversary. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t exclusive to game designers either, it saw testers, artists and producers all rise up. Lionhead was a very supportive place to work in that respect, I once heard it referred to as a university where leaving the studio is simply you graduating.\u201d Lionhead no longer has a future but, for dozens if not hundreds of young talents, it helped create theirs. From the outside, the team that came to work on B&W might look like luck. Sean Roberts for example, responsible for the animation-blending system that made the creature move with then-incredible grace, was working as a deliveryman \u2013 for a company called Black and White motorcycle couriers. \u201cSo obviously when he walked in for an interview we\u2019d already decided you\u2019ve got the job,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cFate was speaking.\u201d Maybe it was fate, because no-one\u2019s this lucky. Jonty Barnes was hired as a 16 year old \u201cwith an incredible work ethic,\u201d and is now the executive producer on Bungie\u2019s Destiny. Daniel Deptford came from work experience too, and is now Microsoft\u2019s principal software engineer on HoloLens. Demis Hassabis followed Molyneux and co. from Bullfrog to be B&W\u2019s AI lead, though he\u2019s now better known for his company DeepMind which last year achieved an AI breakthrough with the grandmaster-smashing AlphaGo. Richard Evans, another of the AI experts behind the creature, currently researches in the field for Google. Then there are Alex Evans and Mark Healey, who co-founded Media Molecule and are now making a game, Dreams, that really is insanely ambitious. Lionhead is gone, but it\u2019s inventive legacy lives on. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to talk through all the happy memories,\u201d says Molyneux. \u201cIt\u2019s tough today because I did look out of the window, and from my office I can see the Lionhead building, and it\u2019s so terrible to see the windows dark. It really is. All I am and all I have ever been is the frontman for the genius people I\u2019ve worked with, and there were a lot of geniuses there that just did incredible things and were unbelievably devoted. It\u2019s a sad day.\u201d",
