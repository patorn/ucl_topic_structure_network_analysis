  "body": "Alan Rusbridger, Chair-elect of The Scott Trust, has decided not to take up the post in September and to resign as a Trustee. The Trust has reluctantly accepted his decision, although it was its unanimous hope that he would stay on the Board. Alan Rusbridger said: \u201cThe Scott Trust plays a crucial role in nurturing and protecting Guardian and Observer journalism. The economic climate facing all newspapers has changed drastically in the last 12 months. It\u2019s obvious that new business models will have to be created and I can understand why a new team would want a new Chair. I send my former colleagues every possible good wish for the future.\u201d Liz Forgan, Chair of The Scott Trust, said: \u201cAlan Rusbridger\u2019s contribution to the Guardian over 20 years as editor-in-chief is immeasurable. He has been the creative leader of this place and an inspiration to generations of journalists. His decision reflects his enormous integrity and his dedication to the Guardian\u201d. Liz Forgan remains as Chair while The Scott Trust embarks on an open and transparent process to appoint her successor. -Ends-",
