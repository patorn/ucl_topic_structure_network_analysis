  "body": "American authorities preparing for the extradition of the alleged drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n to stand trial in the US appear to have quietly scrapped plans to prosecute him for a series of brutal murders committed inside Mexico. A detailed list of a dozen specific killings that were previously tied to the notorious Sinaloa cartel leader has been dropped from Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s charge sheet by federal prosecutors in New York without any official announcement. Legal experts said the move could make it easier to secure convictions on the many drug trafficking charges against Guzm\u00e1n, and to avoid disputes over the authority of US courts to rule on crimes in a foreign country. Guzm\u00e1n is being held in Mexico after his recapture in January following a second prison escape. The Mexican government announced on Friday it had approved his extradition to the US, where he faces dozens of charges in a series of US cities that were allegedly blighted by the multibillion-dollar operations of his Sinaloa cartel.

Attorneys for Guzm\u00e1n said on Friday, however, that they would be filing \u201cmultiple legal challenges\u201d against his extradition. Friday\u2019s ruling covered an extradition request from a Texas federal court related to charges of conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and marijuana, money laundering, arms possession and murder, and another extradition request from a federal court in California. But federal prosecutors in New York\u2019s eastern district, where Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s network allegedly sent almost four tonnes of cocaine in 2002-03, are reported to have won the right to try him after competing with rival cases including Chicago, San Diego, and El Paso for the justice department\u2019s approval. \u201cIt is a calculus that involves a lot of different issues, but what it boils down to at the end of day is: who\u2019s got the best charges and who\u2019s got the best evidence,\u201d said Theresa Van Vliet, a former chief of narcotics at the justice department. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d A grand jury indictment filed in Brooklyn in September 2014, when the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, was the district\u2019s top federal prosecutor, charged Guzm\u00e1n and an ally with 12 murders that were carried out in Mexico between 2000 and 2008, along with two attempted murders and multiple murder conspiracies against rival cartels.

Guzm\u00e1n was also accused of the murders in 2005 of six \u201cJohn Does\u201d, whose identities were disclosed to grand jurors but kept secret from the public. But a new indictment, which was filed in Brooklyn last week and supersedes previous charges against Guzm\u00e1n, now features only one paragraph accusing him and his co-defendant \u2013 fellow drug lord Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda \u2013 of a murder conspiracy against unspecified \u201cpersons who posed a threat to the Sinaloa cartel\u201d. Asked whether this meant that Guzm\u00e1n was no longer accused of murder, Nellin McIntosh, a spokeswoman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, said: \u201cNo comment.\u201d McIntosh confirmed that no public announcement of the new indictment was made. Several legal analysts pointed to the possibility that the removal of murder charges could make it easier to have Guzm\u00e1n extradited from Mexico, which does not allow the transfer of suspects who may face the death penalty. The Mexican foreign ministry\u2019s statement on Friday said: \u201cThe US government provided sufficient assurances that the death penalty shall not apply if Mr Guzm\u00e1n Loera were extradited and tried in that country.\u201d \u201cThe are many life sentences that can be found in the narcotics counts,\u201d said Kendall Coffey, a former US attorney in Miami, who handled major drugs cases. \u201cIt makes plenty of sense to adjust the indictment.\u201d           El Chapo arrest: Mexican marines\u2019 raid ends in shootout    Although Friday\u2019s ruling by the Mexican government related to charges in California and Texas, former senior prosecutors said Guzm\u00e1n could yet end up in any of the jurisdictions where he is indicted, including Brooklyn. The US attorney in Miami, another district with a case against Guzm\u00e1n, has been added as a special counsel on the Brooklyn case, indicating that the two teams are combining efforts. Prosecutors previously argued that despite being committed in Mexico, the murders could be prosecuted in Brooklyn because they took place in the \u201cextraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States\u201d. This same phrase was also used repeatedly in the 2014 indictment to describe the locations of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s alleged drug trafficking offenses. The phrase has, however, been wiped from the new indictment against Guzm\u00e1n. Asked whether American authorities now intend only to prosecute Guzm\u00e1n for alleged offenses on US soil, McIntosh again said: \u201cNo comment.\u201d The \u201cextraterritorial jurisdiction\u201d formulation has been used in the past to prosecute foreign nationals for offenses such as killing Americans \u2013 particularly US government officials \u2013 in other countries. Its deployment for cases of foreign murders involving foreign suspects and foreign victims is, however, highly unusual if not unprecedented. Professor Anthony Colangelo of Southern Methodist University said prosecuting Guzm\u00e1n this way could be \u201cproblematic for a number of reasons\u201d starting with the principle that \u201cextraterritorial jurisdiction\u201d is presumed not to apply to a US law unless specified in the relevant statute. \u201cAnd constitutionally, it\u2019s just not clear to me what would authorize Congress to enact a law that applies to a foreign defendant and a foreign victim in a foreign location,\u201d said Colangelo.   Related: El Chapo entered US twice while on the run after prison break, daughter claims    The new indictment against Guzm\u00e1n signals that prosecutors will instead focus on proving that Guzm\u00e1n was responsible for offenses such as illegal drug sales and money laundering within the US. Newly added lines specify repeatedly that drugs were sent \u201cinto the United States\u201d by \u201cboat and submarine crews, pilots and truck drivers\u201d and that money was funneled \u201cfrom the United States back to Mexico\u201d. The new indictment may also be thought to allow Mexican authorities to save face, as authorities in Brooklyn are no longer explicitly claiming to have authority over actions on their territory. Mexico was previously reluctant to extradite Guzm\u00e1n. An allegation in the 2014 indictment that Guzm\u00e1n and Zambada\u2019s campaign of violence dissuaded Mexican police officers, troops and other public officials \u201cfrom enforcing Mexican drug laws and disrupting the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s activities\u201d has also notably been removed from the new indictment. Van Vliet, the former chief of narcotics at the justice department, described it as \u201ccommon sense\u201d that the new form of charges would be preferred in Mexico. The new charges could also prevent complications that might jeopardize a conviction, according to Colangelo. \u201cIf they botched it up by including allegations that led to statutory or constitutional problems and an acquittal, he couldn\u2019t be prosecuted again because of the principle of double jeopardy,\u201d said Colangelo. \u201cTalk about killing your career as a prosecutor.\u201d",
