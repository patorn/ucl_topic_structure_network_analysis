But you can also choose to take a wider focus by demanding industry-level change from big polluters and advocating bold shifts in government policy. Both have their drawbacks: the former can seem insignificant; the latter, insurmountable. But there is a middle ground: grassroots organization, where individuals come together to address the unique environmental challenges faced by their own communities, neighborhoods and social groups.  Organizations like these marry the power of individual agency with the strength found in numbers, to remarkable effect. Loud enough to be heard, small enough to be responsive; put plainly, these groups get things done. We all need a little inspiration sometimes, in between feeling ineffective or outmatched, but it can be hard to find among the doom and gloom of climate news. I\u2019ve rounded up a brief profile of three groups to provide a glimpse at the good that\u2019s being done out there.

Based in Vancouver and Montreal, the Binners\u2019 Project works to legitimize binners, destigmatize the work they do and recognize the thousands of pounds of waste they help divert from landfills.  Their results: By providing easily identifiable shirts, nametags and carts, the project has changed bottle picking from an activity tinted with shame to a proudly activist endeavour. Additionally, in an effort to draw attention to the issue of non-recyclable waste, the Binners\u2019 Project began the annual Coffee Cup Revolution. Each year, for one day, binners receive 5 cents for each coffee cup returned to organizers. At the 2015 event, more than 31,000 cups were collected and diverted from landfills in just a few hours. How you can get involved: In Vancouver or Montreal, head to their site to receive a binner\u2019s hook you can install in your back lane, or to schedule regular pickups of recyclables. If you live in an area without a Binners\u2019 Project, you could consider saying a simple \u201cthank you\u201d to the next binner you see.  Greening Forward What they do: Founded in 2008 by a then 12-year-old Charles Orgbon III, Greening Forward is now the largest youth-driven environmental organization in the United States. Providing grants, planting trees, spearheading recycling initiatives, diverting over 200 tons of waste from landfills and, above all, engaging today\u2019s youth in environmental issues, this organization is poised to become a powerful agent for change.  Their results: Through initiatives such as their Earth Savers club, which offers support, resources and financial assistance to partners the world over, Greening Forward allows young people to participate in a process often left to adults. By connecting teens with resources and equipping them with leadership skills, Greening Forward is building the next generation of educated environmentalists. Perhaps most importantly, it\u2019s an organization made up of young people who give a damn \u2013 anyone who\u2019s ever complained about the apathy generation should sit up and take notice.  How you can also make a change: Head to their website to join Greening Forward, donate or apply for a grant, or consider attending their International Young Environmentalists Youth Summit on 13-14 May in New York. Details here.  Women\u2019s Environmental Network What they do: Founded in 1988, WEN explicitly recognizes the unique role women can take in the environmental process, acknowledges the disproportionate ways climate change can affect women and empowers women to campaign for positive change. WEN capitalizes on the fact that women are statistically more likely than men to change consumer behavior due to environmental concerns and to be involved in grassroots action to tackle climate change, and also addresses issues (such as waste from menstrual products) often ignored by mainstream enviro groups. Their results: Currently zeroing in on the issue of food production, WEN has built 15 community food gardens and offers free training courses on growing organic food. These initiatives not only increase access to fresh food in low-income areas, but facilitate connection, support and community between participants.  How you can also make a change: Chapters of WEN have sprouted up all over the globe \u2013 a quick internet search will find one in your area. Join to get involved in local initiatives, or spearhead a few of your own.  These are three organizations of literally thousands and they prove that change is possible, at any level and on any scale you wish to create it. If you\u2019ve ever doubted that we\u2019re capable of great things, you\u2019re simply not looking hard enough.",
