Donald Trump, the real estate tycoon once known primarily for his mop of orange hair, perma-tan and catchphrase \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d, has become the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican party. The country, including many top figures within the GOP itself, is struggling to come to terms with the unthinkable, the unconscionable, the downright preposterous: in theory, Trump is now one short hop away from the White House. To say that the news has unsettled the party of which he is now the nominal head would be a gross understatement \u2013 thunderstruck, flabbergasted or devastated would be closer to the mark. On Wednesday the final opponent to the former reality TV star, the governor of Ohio John Kasich, suspended his campaign following on the heels of Ted Cruz, the senator for Texas, who concluded he had no way to compete with Trump in the wake of the Indiana primary the day before. The Republican race was over. When asked by the Guardian to describe the impact on the Republican party of Trump\u2019s now-inevitable nomination, Rick Wilson, a prominent conservative strategist who worked on the presidential campaigns of both George Bushes, replied: \u201cWhat Republican party? The party I grew up in is done, it\u2019s over. As long as Donald Trump is the definition of our brand, it\u2019s dead.\u201d     Trump announces that he will run for president of the United States, in the lobby of Trump Tower, New York, 16 June 2015. Photograph: Richard Drew/AP    Charlie Sykes, a popular conservative radio host in Milwaukee, said: \u201cDonald Trump represents the antithesis of everything I have fought for in the last 30 years. He is a neo-fascist buffoon.\u201d  Influential conservative pundits are calling on party members to work to keep Trump from securing the most powerful job on earth. George Will in the Washington Post exhorted conservatives to help Trump lose in all 50 states, while Mark Salter, a strategist for the 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, went as far as to say on Twitter that he would vote for Hillary Clinton, tweeting: \u201cI\u2019m with her.\u201d  Countless other Republicans are flocking to the anti-Trump website nevertrump.com, whose pledge has more than 30,000 signatories. How did it come to this? How did an event that many pundits predicted could and would never happen come to pass? A look back at how Trump ran his primary campaign throws up more questions than answers. It is easier to list the things that he has done wrong in the past year than those he has done right. In the 11 months since he declared his candidacy for the presidency, he has insulted a wide range of ethnic and religious groups, ignored age-old wisdom about how to run a political campaign and taken policy positions way beyond the mainstream. And, in ways that people are only beginning to accept and understand, it has worked. Even his son Eric, speaking to the Guardian at the victory party on Tuesday night in Trump Tower, the candidate\u2019s gauchely glittering Manhattan home, expressed surprise at how his father had pulled it off. \u201cHe\u2019s done an amazing job, for a man who has never been a politician and has self-funded his campaign.\u201d When Trump first announced his candidacy in June, it was to sneers among many in the chattering classes. Everything about him was uncouth, ranging from his entrance on an escalator in Trump Tower to his accusation that the Mexican government was deliberately sending rapists across the border into the US. His nearly hourlong stream of consciousness was broadcast live in its entirety on cable news as an apparent freak show \u2013 but it touched a chord with voters. In droves, they embraced Trump\u2019s message and bought his branded hats (\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d). They didn\u2019t need to have their attitudes measured in polls or groomed through sophisticated targeted advertising. They were mad as hell and they weren\u2019t going take the mainstream Republican party any more.

Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP    Trump proved to be pretty entertaining, too \u2013 if visceral attacks against rivals such as Jeb \u201clow-energy\u201d Bush and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz were your sort of entertainment. The unlikeliest of presidential candidates began to attract huge crowds across the south and the north-east. As the no doubt bloody and enduring post-mortem begins, many fingers of blame are being pointed at the media, which afforded the candidate copious amounts of free air time in return for stellar viewing figures and web clicks. As long ago as March, the New York Times estimated that Trump had been showered with almost $2bn worth of media attention without spending a dime of his own money. Trump also proved to be adept in whipping up the crowd on social media, with a Twitter feed that today attracts nearly eight million followers. As with so much of his campaign, the normal rules of presidential electioneering didn\u2019t seem to apply to him \u2013 he could retweet white supremacists, repeat conspiracy theories and spout blatant untruths in ways that would have destroyed previous candidates yet seemed to wash off him without effect. As the in-fighting within the Republican party intensifies in the wake of Trump\u2019s coronation, some had harsh words about culpability. Rick Wilson said that the conservative media, and the established media generally, had questions to answer about how they gave him a pass. \u201cHe was let get away with things that would disqualify any other candidate. The media just shrugged its shoulders and said: \u2018It\u2019s Donald being Donald.\u2019\u201d Charlie Sykes laid some of the blame on his fellow talkshow hosts on the national stage \u2013 for example, Rush Limbaugh, who has been effusive about Trump. \u201cWhen we undertake the inevitable reckoning, the role of talkshow hosts in dumbing down and distorting the debate, misleading listeners and enabling Donald Trump will be a major factor, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d But such substantial criticisms of the media should not let the Republican party itself off the hook. As Sykes puts it, there was a \u201cfailure of principle, a failure of nerve, a failure to coalesce around a credible alternative candidate\u201d. To some extent, the extreme rightwing policies that Trump has made his own were merely reframings of populist slogans laid down by his supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d predecessors. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out criminal and rapist \u201cillegals\u201d was anticipated by Mitt Romney\u2019s earlier pledge to force the \u201cself-deportation\u201d of undocumented immigrants \u2013 which made Romney\u2019s later denunciation of Trump somewhat duplicitous.

Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images    The 16 other GOP presidential candidates who lined up against Trump at the start of the campaign also made a pact with the devil in which they largely agreed to look the other way until it was too late. Wilson has calculated that Jeb Bush devoted 10 times as much money fighting his fellow Floridian Marco Rubio than he did battling the real estate billionaire while Cruz spent \u201cnine months cozying up to Donald Trump and then the final month saying he was a monster. That lacked a certain amount of credibility\u201d. At his victory speech on Tuesday night, Trump bragged that the Republican establishment spent $8m in its desperate attempt to stop him, including 60,000 negative TV ads which he called \u201cabsolutely false and disgusting\u201d. But he added: \u201cThe people are so smart they don\u2019t buy it. They get it.\u201d \u201cThe people\u201d to whom he was alluding were the preponderantly older white male voters who tend to dominate Republican primary elections. With Trump posting a 67% unfavorability rating among Americans generally \u2013 the worst showing of any presidential nominee of either main party since at least 1984 \u2013 the people may prove not to be so \u201csmart\u201d, by Trump\u2019s definition, when the wider electorate gets to have its say in November.  (Clinton, however, has her own troubles with favorability. More than half of voters also say they view her negatively.) But all that lies ahead. For now, there is Trump\u2019s unstoppable nomination to deal with, and the shattering recognition it brings that the Republican party has given birth to a candidate who, for many Americans, embodies their darkest fears.
