  "body": "Susan Sarandon: porn mogul? The Oscar-winning actor suggested as much at the Cannes film festival, saying she\u2019d consider a sideways move into the adult film industry to make erotic movies which embrace a female point of view.    Related: Susan Sarandon blasts Woody Allen and Donald Trump at Cannes    According to the Times, Sarandon, who was in Cannes to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Thelma & Louise with her co-star, Geena Davis, argued that female directors are more comfortable with exploring the emotional undercurrent of a sex scene on film: \u201cWhat the scene is supposed to tell you about these people.\u201d Sarandon said that the porn industry could therefore benefit from the female gaze. \u201cI have threatened, in my 80s, to direct porn,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t watched enough to know what the problems are. Most pornography is brutal and doesn\u2019t look pleasurable from a female point of view. So I\u2019ve been saying that when I no longer want to act, I want to do that.\u201d Sarandon\u2019s career has required her involvement in a fair number of sex scenes in films such Bill Durham and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Speaking in Cannes, she revealed that she has long fought to make such sequences more meaningful through collaboration with her male directors. She cited her experience making Tony Scott\u2019s 1983 vampire film, The Hunger, as a fruitful example. One scene involves an encounter between Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve.

You have to be drunk to get into bed with Catherine Deneuve? I don\u2019t think so. Isn\u2019t it more interesting if it is voluntary?\u2019\u201d Sarandon added that it is the before and after in such scenarios, rather than the intercourse itself, which most interests her.  \u201cA lot of people know what\u2019s in the middle,\u201d said Sarandon. \u201cBut what makes a sex act really interesting is how that first touch happens, how that first kiss comes, so in The Hunger Tony allowed me to come up with an idea about the T-shirt and then the kiss. Those moments need to be looked at.\u201d",
