  "body": "The chief minister of the Northern Territory should resign over comments he made that a Labor parliamentarian was dyslexic, the NT Speaker has said. The chief minister, Adam Giles, made the remarks in parliament on Thursday morning, on the final sitting day before the NT goes to the polls in August. Talking of a future Labor government, Giles said: \u201cLet us hope the dyslexic member for Nightcliff is not the minister for education.\u201d He then defended his comments.

Kezia Purick, the NT Speaker and former member of the governing Country Liberal Party, labelled his comments \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cthe lowest of low\u201d. \u201cIt is time that he resigned,\u201d Purick wrote on Facebook. \u201cMr Giles I have a sister who has dyslexia so your comments are outrageous and on behalf of all people who have or love a person with dyslexia you should publicly apologise and, if not, resign.\u201d Fyles said the comments were \u201chighly offensive, disrespectful and hurtful to many Territorians\u201d. She said they sent the wrong message to people who were proving every day that having a learning difficulty was not a barrier to success. \u201cThe chief minister needs to apologise or resign,\u201d Fyles said. She dismissed the suggestion that the NT parliament \u2013 which has seen no shortage of controversies and personal spats in this term \u2013 regularly manufactured outrage instead of debating policy.

There was no vote and the process will now have to restart with a new bill in the next government. The federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, who was in Darwin campaigning for the upcoming federal election, said having dyslexia or any other condition did not define a person. \u201cOur leaders in public life have an obligation not to single out individuals or groups of people or minorities and pillory them or make fun of them,\u201d he said. \u201cAdam Giles should get off the back of people, focus on what he\u2019s not doing, rather than worrying about other people.\u201d",
