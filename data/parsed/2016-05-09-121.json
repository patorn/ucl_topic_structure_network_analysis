Instead, we\u2019re dividing them into four distinct demographic categories, each with its own name. What four categories? Well, there are the Smarties (senior market town retirees) \u2013 old people who retire to market towns, instead of the traditional seaside. I\u2019m going to take your word for it that this is a thing. Then there are Diamond Days (affluent, mortgage-free suburbanites), Senior Security (well-off but risk-averse), and the Vintage Value (not so well-off). Those aren\u2019t very good names. Don\u2019t blame me, blame the credit-checking company Experian, in whose report these demographics are profiled. I disagree with Experian\u2019s patronising assessment of seniors. Not to mention their patronising assessment of my creditworthiness. I\u2019m afraid this is only the latest attempt to demolish broad stereotypes of the elderly, and replace them with slightly more specific stereotypes with cute names. What were some of the others? You will recall Grey Panthers and Silver Surfers. In the US, they are wont to divide pensioners into the Elders (retirees living in senior accommodation), Silver and Gold (old and wealthy) and Rustbelt Retirees (old couples who stay put in industrial cities). Pensioners can\u2019t enjoy being stereotyped in this fashion, can they? Probably not, but they don\u2019t really like being called \u201cpensioners\u201d, either. Or \u201celderly\u201d. A 2012 survey found that their top pick was \u201csenior citizen\u201d. Well that\u2019s that. Senior citizen it is. Except it doesn\u2019t really address the increasing demographic spread as people live longer. So, we need to distinguish between the medium old, the well old and the bare old? Exactly. A couple of years ago the term \u201cReal Senior\u201d was introduced to specify the 85+ bracket. That\u2019s not just terrible, it actually bespeaks of prejudice against the not-very-old. Who came up with that? A bunch of old people - but to be fair to them, they were choosing from a list that included the Very Oldies, the Long Lived, Wisdom Warriors and the Venerables. Do say: \u201cOf course we need terms that convey the range of diversity among the over-65s. But we also need some kind of government vetting procedure for the names.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the Solbios \u2013 Seniors Outside Lidl Before It Opens.\u201d",
