  "body": "\u2022 With Sir Martin Sorrell able to calmly repel insolent questions about his \u00a370m pay package by pointing to healthy sales growth at WPP, Monkey is concerned that he\u2019s not being interrogated about the marked lack of innovation and improvement in one area \u2013 the ever-changing metaphors for his company or the economy for which he was once renowned. The Napoleon of hype first invoked swans when weighing up an acquisition in 2004 (\u201cat this stage it is not a beautiful swan or an ugly duckling\u201d), before channelling Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Donald Rumsfeld as he contrasted unforeseeable black swans with the \u201cfour grey swans\u201d of known threats to global growth in 2012. And ever since then they\u2019ve reappeared as he answers press posers \u2013 last week the terracotta-tanned titan deployed the metaphor yet again, noting that \u201cthe grey swans or known unknowns haven\u2019t got any whiter and the black swans or unknown unknowns are still there\u201d. But how does Mystic Martin know that unknown unknowns are there? \u2022 Another Sunday Times Rich List, and once again a certain plutocrat has unaccountably gone missing (although he is allowed into the World, as opposed to British, Rich List, where family wealth estimated at \u00a38.3bn earns him a lowly ranking of 92nd). According to the \u201cRules of Engagement\u201d small print at the back, \u201cwe exclude Rupert Murdoch\u201d, the chairman of the paper\u2019s parent company, \u201cas he is a US citizen and based in America\u201d, although these rules also state that even foreigners who merely possess \u201cstrong links to Britain\u201d are included. Turn to the top of the chart and you oddly find at No 3 music-to-metals magnate Len Blavatnik, likewise a \u201cUS citizen\u201d, likewise an owner of luxury residences in New York and London, and someone \u2013 like other non-Brits on the list \u2013 with less strong links to Britain than the ultimate owner of three of its national newspapers and Sky. Among those also deemed eligible, with real or theoretical residence abroad evidently not disqualifying them, are the Monaco-based Barclay brothers at No 12 and Viscount Rothermere (who reportedly has non-dom status) at a surely disappointing No 117. Richard Desmond, a rare instance of a British and British-based press baron, comes between them in 48th spot, his \u00a32.25bn estimated fortune more than twice Rothermere\u2019s \u00a31bn. \u2022 Was the choice of estate agencies to flog TV Centre flats (top price: \u00a37m) to fatcats entirely wise, Monkey wonders. No problem with Knight Frank, but given what once went on at the former BBC home of shows such as Top of the Pops (as exposed in the Dame Janet Smith Review earlier this year), there is said to be disbelief in some quarters that another agency wasn\u2019t picked instead of Savills. \u2022 Prone to drop off with the help of the nightly tedium that earned Newsnight its \u201cSnoozenight\u201d nickname? You\u2019re not alone. \u201cI watch Newsnight in bed,\u201d Kirsty Wark tells the Radio Times. \u201cSometimes I fall asleep and watch it on iPlayer the next morning.\u201d No clue, sadly, as to which of her fellow-presenters, Evan Davis or Emily Maitlis, is more likely to act as televisual Nytol. \u2022 As he limbers up for next weekend\u2019s launch of ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday \u2013 at 10am, up against newly promoted John Pienaar on Radio 5 Live rather than Andrew Marr on BBC1, and wooing politicians with an Evan Davis-mimicking pledge of non-aggressive interviewing \u2013 Robert Peston has retweeted a first unveiling of its logo with the question \u201cwhatcha think?\u201d Faced with an image that combines the host\u2019s initials, what Monkey thinks is that Pesto might be wise to reconsider the way one leg of the \u201cR\u201d juts out (possibly meant to be a tongue or jaw) so that it resembles, er, something male, dangling and limp in a blue condom. And the lack of Arsenal colours is disappointing too. \u2022 The centrepiece of the first tranche in 2012 of the BBC\u2019s Shakespeare adaptations, The Hollow Crown, was Henry IV parts 1 and 2 \u2013 a perfect match, with Jeremy Irons as the weary, ageing Henry, for the end of the BBC reign of Mark Thompson, then a few months away from moving on. And as the second tranche beginning next weekend opens with Henry VI, it\u2019s pretty clear that we\u2019re meant to see Thommo\u2019s hapless short-lived successor George Entwistle in the feeble, disastrous titular king. Where, though, will the corporation find a Shakespearean counterpart for Lord Hall, who was anointed after Entwistle\u2019s abdication? Monkey hears that the Roman plays may be next for the telly treatment, but which of them contains a ruler whose friends keep on either deserting him or behaving so embarrassingly they are obliged to quit the court? Perhaps a batch of comedies should be considered instead.",
