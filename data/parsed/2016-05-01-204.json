  "body": "Ahoy, my ageing hearties. Increasing numbers of mega liners are being built. These monster ships can carry, entertain and feed 5,000 passengers at a time. Meanwhile research from Tourism Concern shows that the older vessels are responsible for 36 times as many greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometre than Eurostar and three and a half times more than a long-haul flight. And this is just the start of a long ethical rap sheet. So here are the questions to ask before setting sail that nobody does\u2026 \u201cWill I visit real places?\u201d Tourism Concern says that cruise lines create their own economic fiefdoms, even off-ship. When cruisers disembarked on a magical Caribbean resort, it was really a bit of Haiti rented by the cruise line. As food and drink were bought using cruise-liner credit cards, money stayed in the system and the quite desperate local economy got little from the visit \u2013 apart from the full force of cruise pollution. So\u2026 \u201cHow clean is your ship?\u201d Many run on bunker fuel (a cheap byproduct from refineries), with 2,000 times the sulphur content of diesel. Legally, a cruise ship can release 30,000 gallons a day of human waste three miles beyond shore. \u201cDo you pay a living wage?\u201d Many cruise ship employees work long hours for less than the minimum wage, with unionisation punishable by sacking. And finally: \u201cThis ship flies a Liberian flag \u2013 are we visiting Africa?\u201d Probably not. Flying \u201cflags of convenience\u201d allows transnational status, lower regulations and little or no tax obligations. Tourism Concern suggests that the greenest cruise is no cruise. At least until 2020, when a Japanese NGO launches the Peace Boat, a sustainable cruise liner featuring solar-panel sails. Get on board. The big picture: Skateistan Skate School, Kabul     Peace on wheels: skateboarders in Kabul. Photograph: Hamdullah Hamdard    Action sports such as skateboarding and surfing can speak to the young like nothing else. Professor Holly Thorpe, of the University of Waikato in New Zealand, has published research into the potential for these activities to help international development. There are now 150 Sports for Development and Peace-related organisations around the world. The skateistan.org skate-school project is one. The project photographed here by Hamdullah Hamdard is in Kabul. A new skate school is also being built in Johannesburg. Well dressed: Mafia bags     Flying high: the Tubo bag.

Since 2014 they\u2019ve been producing them in California and incorporating ex-windsurfs and boat sails with kitesurfs, recycling more than 750 sails a year. Their range of everything from messenger bags, duffels and totes to full rucksacks hugely popular in the US and Japan, and lately in the UK. No two bags are the same \u2013 they\u2019re from upcycled sailcloths, after all \u2013 but all are handmade in California to resist wind and water exposure and perform in extreme weather conditions. They come with a lifetime guarantee \u2013 and, of course, they\u2019re infused with the spirit of extreme adventure from their past life. Mafia Bags are available online or at their concession in Topshop.Rucksacks from \u00a385; totes from \u00a330 mafiabags.com Email Lucy at lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @lucysiegle",
