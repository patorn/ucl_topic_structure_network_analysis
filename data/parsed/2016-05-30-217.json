  "body": "Hollywood is no stranger to snatching talent from Australian shores. And with the runaway success of horror-doused psychological thriller The Babadook, director-writer Jennifer Kent\u2019s 2014 debut feature film, it became her instant invitation into the Los Angeles film industry elite. But Kent doesn\u2019t bite so easily. She won\u2019t divulge exactly which movies, only that many were offered, and were consequently turned down by her. Any big-budget superhero flicks on that list? \u201cPossibly,\u201d she says, slyly. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, when I hear people crying about, \u2018Oh, female directors are never offered these big tentpole films ... what about Jennifer Kent? She\u2019s not doing anything!,\u2019 I sort of read it and chuckle because, well, you have no idea what\u2019s going on at my end \u2013 what I\u2019m actually saying no to.\u201d Initially reluctant to sign with an agent (\u201cSomeone described it at Sundance as an \u2018agent derby\u2019, with me running and them all running after me,\u201d she says), her American representation has helped her politely decline all manner of scripts. She navigates the offers by asking herself one, simple question: what would David Lynch do? \u201cI remember David Lynch saying, \u2018Just be very true to yourself and people will respond to that and give you money to do more,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cPeople like him and Lars von Trier were my mentors by proxy when I was being offered all this stuff.\u201d   Related: The Babadook review \u2013 a superbly acted, chilling Freudian thriller | Peter Bradshaw    Being a writer as well as a director has allowed Kent more creative independence, and among the many nos she has given a resounding yes to writing and directing a film adaption of Alice + Freda Forever, a book handed to her by a producer on the Warner Bros studio lot. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this dark strange lesbian gothic love story,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Yeah, I wanna do that one!\u2019\u201d Written by Alexis Coe, it chronicles a 1892 true crime story of teen lovers in Memphis, Tennessee. But before that, Kent will be working on a second Australian film called The Nightingale, funded by Screen Australia and Screen Tasmania, with a 2017 release date. It\u2019s set on the Australian island state of Tasmania \u2013 a place Kent describes as \u201cthis strange island off an island at the arse end of the world, there\u2019s great beauty there and a lot of sadness\u201d \u2013 in 1829, during a particularly brutal period of colonial history which all but annihilated Tasmania\u2019s Indigenous peoples.     Jennifer Kent\u2019s debut feature film, The Babadook. Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex    \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a horror film,\u201d she says, comparing it with The Babadook, \u201cbut it\u2019s a pretty horrific world.\u201d The Nightingale is about the \u201cpointlessness of revenge\u201d, Kent says. A 21-year-old Irish convict called Claire chases a British soldier through the rugged Tasmanian wilderness, bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence he committed against her family. She enlists the services of an Indigenous tracker called Billy, who is also marked by trauma from his own violence-filled past. Although not based on a true story, she wanted the film to adhere closely to the reality of the era. Any concern that her imagined stories were too heinous or over-the-top were quickly mitigated by a trip to the history section of her library, she says, where she learned of the island\u2019s comparably gruesome past. She discovered the British empire\u2019s worst repeat criminals were sent to Tasmania \u2013 the rapists, murderers and everyone they \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle\u201d on the mainland. \u201cIt was seen as hell-on-earth at the time,\u201d she says.  Female convicts were brought in by the shipload to address the Tasmanian penal colony\u2019s severe gender imbalance; a roaring \u201cwife\u201d trade saw them sold for as little as \u00a35 and a gallon of rum. Some of these women would disappear into the bush, never to be heard of again, while others were raped and sentenced to hard labour for the crime of pregnancy. \u201cIt was a really crazy time for women,\u201d Kent says, and it\u2019s one rarely told in explicit detail. \u201cWe only hear the sanitised version and I wanted to explore it for real.\u201d     Jennifer Kent: \u2018I couldn\u2019t go down to Tasmania \u2013 which was the worst place, the worst attempted annihilation of a culture \u2013 and not do this the right way.\u2019 Photograph: Jennifer Kent    It is not the only aspect of Australia\u2019s colonial history that has been sanitised, of course. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go down to Tasmania \u2013 which was the worst place, the worst attempted annihilation of a culture \u2013 and not do this the right way,\u201d Kent says. \u201cI feel we\u2019re grown up enough now to look at it and accept it as part of our history.\u201d  The film\u2019s other key character, Billy, was born into a world untouched by white people; when his family was attacked by settlers, he was an adolescent. His father and other family members were murdered, his mother disappeared and Billy was left to cope with this terrible loss alone. \u201cImmediately I felt for him as a character,\u201d Kent says. \u201cI think he\u2019s incredibly resilient. He hates white people. So would I.\u201d  By the time he meets Claire, Billy is in his early 20s. \u201cWhen we meet him he\u2019s very damaged, but in the journey of the film I hope to give him back his dignity. It\u2019s very important to the story. It\u2019s as important as Claire\u2019s story.\u201d Neither character is perfect, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the noble, mystical savage and the sweet Irish convict girl. It\u2019s kind of the opposite: they start out both really quite racist, hating each other and fearful of each other.\u201d Kent says there was \u201cno way\u201d she would embark on such a story without meaningful Indigenous consultation; she has been working closely with the Tasmanian Aboriginal elder Jim Everett, and spending time with him on Cape Barren Island. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Jen, this is a shared story,\u2019 and in a way I felt this gave me the permission to tell it.\u201d Kent is seeking Everett\u2019s guidance in every stage of the film, from the script, to upcoming casting and shooting. Everett will be on set and working closely with Indigenous actors to make sure all cultural protocol is respected. \u201cWe are committed and we go in humbly asking for help.\u201d Rolf de Heer, the great Dutch Australian film-maker famed for working intimately with Indigenous communities (Ten Canoes, Charlie\u2019s Country), also lent his support. She says he advised her to trim back her crew and make more time: \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a story like this in the wilderness, with a different culture that works on a different time, give yourself that time.\u201d     Engraving by Gustav Dor\u00e9 from Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, circa 1850. Photograph: Hulton Getty    Rather than using stylised \u201cmovie violence\u201d, or graphic, gratuitous scenes, Kent is hoping for an authenticity that will make the film shocking. This has the film\u2019s financiers a touch nervous, Kent says, but it\u2019s integral to her aim: to show the huge repercussions of all types of violence, and pose the question, \u2018How should a person respond?\u2019 Unlike other Australian \u201cwesterns\u201d that play out on the vast open spaces of desolate desert canvasses, Kent\u2019s film is set in the enclosed woodlands of Tasmania. \u201cI want it to feel like it was almost like there was no sun, ever.\u201d With her director of photography, Radek Ladczuk (who also worked on The Babadook), they have been looking at the mythic illustrations of Gustave Dor\u00e9 for inspiration. That claustrophobic atmosphere was also present in The Babadook, which was mainly set in a creepy and decrepit Victorian house, but Kent says where that film was \u201cvery formal\u201d, The Nightingale will have more movement. \u201cThey\u2019re going into the centre of hell, and going out the other side.\u201d From psychological monsters to frontier violence and obsessive love, Kent is clearly drawn to dark material, but says only when there is \u201csome light running through the centre\u201d. She is committed to developing complex female characters and in all of her films begins with the question: \u201cHow do we remain human when we\u2019re surrounded by inhumanity and darkness and violence?\u201d  That story of surviving grief is too often told from a male perspective, she says. \u201cAnd the answers are usually the same: eye for an eye. With this, it\u2019s not my answer. I don\u2019t have an answer but I wanted to explore what the fallout of violence is and what are the options. What are the other options?\u201d",
