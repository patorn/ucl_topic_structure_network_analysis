  "body": "Much of the recent discourse around classical music and its troubles has contained a subtext of glee at the notion that a privileged class is getting its comeuppance. The perception of classical music as a posh activity is outdated and wrong, as the success of the brilliant BBC Young Musician Sheku Kanneh-Mason (a pupil at a comprehensive school in Nottingham) illustrates (Letters, 18 May). Love of classical music is not dependent on class, but as music education focuses more and more on having a go rather than mastering a skill, it is less and less likely that young people will even have the chance to fall in love with it. Trumped-up issues of class and accessibility are distracting us from the real possibility that if classical music continues to be\u00a0sidelined we\u00a0may lose something very precious. It\u2019s misleading to say that as long as people are involved in some sort of music-making, it does not matter what sort it is. All music-making is certainly beneficial, but western art music\u00a0demonstrates a complexity and depth which few other musical genres have attained. To play it and appreciate it requires skill, devotion\u00a0and understanding, which is why such long training is necessary. There is no shortage of gifted young musicians wishing to undertake this training, but they must wonder why their achievements are largely ignored or even sneered at. It is hard to understand why classical music\u00a0is\u00a0such a scapegoat when other\u00a0heritage art forms\u00a0continue to be widely supported. Letting classical music dwindle away for the sake of \u201cdemocracy\u201d is the equivalent of throwing out traditional literature and filling our bookshops with comics, axing traditional\u00a0drawing and painting courses, or instructing the RSC to abandon Shakespeare and just improvise plays instead because everyone would understand the language straight away. Lovers of art and literature wouldn\u2019t stand for such nonsense, so why should lovers of classical music?Susan TomesEdinburgh \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
