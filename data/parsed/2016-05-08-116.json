  "body": "Do you know the story of the Giant Turnip? Well, this is the classic with a twist! When Hermione finds a crumpled envelope full of seeds, she and Musgrove decide to plant them in Kensington Park Gardens behind the statue of Peter Pan. Day after day, they come back and wait for the seed to grow, and just when all hope seems lost, a little shoot pops out of the ground.  Hour by hour, the turnip grows until it\u2019s so big that everyone can see it! But when Hermione and Musgrove decide to pull it out, it won\u2019t budge. How many people will it take to pull it out?          This book made me giggle, have curious ideas and it really made me feel like a part of the story. My favourite character is Hermione because of how creative she is and the way that she improvises and always finds something positive in life.  I would give this book a 5/5 rating because I love the idea of a rat as an alternative nanny and also the way that Hermione and Musgrove get on so well together as well as having amazing adventures every day!  Me and my family would strongly recommend this book for 4-7 year olds. I enjoyed reading this book very much! Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read?
