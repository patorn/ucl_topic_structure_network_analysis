  "body": "France is to set up a dozen deradicalisation centres across the country to identify would-be extremists and prevent them from joining jihadi groups. The introduction of \u201creinsertion and citizenship centres\u201d in each region is part of an 80-point plan to combat home-grown terrorism, unveiled by the socialist government on Monday. The two-year plan includes a raft of anti-terrorism measures aimed at combatting the increasing number of young people in France drawn to jihadi groups, and at establishing an early warning system to pick up those tempted to join. The prime minister of France, Manuel Valls, said fighting the appeal of \u201cdeadly\u201d doctrines was the greatest challenge the country faced in more than 70 years. He said there had to be a \u201cgeneral mobilisation\u201d of all sectors of society to fight the problem following the terrorist attacks in Paris last year.   Related: 'There was nobody to help me stop my son joining Isis'    \u201cRadicalisation and terrorism are linked. We are faced with a stubborn phenomenon that has widely spread through society and which threatens it because it could expand massively,\u201d Valls said. \u201cThe radicalisation of part of our youth, seduced by a deadly antisocial model, is in my view the most serious challenge we have faced since the second world war because it deeply damages the republican pact.\u201d The strategic document that focuses on detection and prevention of radicalisation was unveiled by Valls in the presence of several ministers in France\u2019s socialist government including those responsible for justice, defence, education, health, culture, youth and sports. The Inter-ministerial Committee for the Prevention of Delinquency and Radicalisation (CIPDR) will oversee the programme, which calls on public, private, religious and secular groups to join forces under the umbrella of a national coordination group. An anonymous freephone number for members of the public to report extremist suspects to the police and help for families of those who have been radicalised, both set up in 2014 under a previous deradicalisation plan are to be extended. Measures to protect sensitive and vulnerable sites and facilities, including nuclear plants and public transport, against terrorist attacks are to be tightened.

France\u2019s intelligence and security services are to be given more staff and money. The deradicalisation centres will house young people who \u201ccould have repented and who we will test the sincerity and willingness to be reintegrated back into society for the long term\u201d, Valls said. He said the aim of the centres would be to stem the flow of young people to Syria and Iraq and begin the process of deradicalising them. At least half of the new centres will hold those deemed by a judge to be at risk of radicalisation but cannot be placed in detention, Valls added. France estimates there are more than 9,000 radicalised people or would-be jihadis in its midst. About 2,000 French nationals or residents are believed to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamic State.",
