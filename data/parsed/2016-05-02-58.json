Why are they not encouraged to move into the workplace?\u201d (Letter, 28 April). But in my view this doesn\u2019t just extend to Asian restaurants (Report, 22 April). I\u2019ve been thinking about this point with regards to the shortage of chefs in the restaurant industry as a whole \u2013 since it was highlighted to me by Sat Bains, a near neighbour, who recently went up to working a four-day week in order to deal with a shortage of talented and hardworking chefs locally. If restaurateurs were able to be more flexible and more open-minded they would find an incredible pool of talent among the women who cook for their families and friends on a daily basis in UK society in general. I\u2019m sure there are many women (myself included) who would be delighted to transfer their skills, and gain much needed confidence, by entering the workplace once again to work for top-class restaurants.Zoe SheltonNottingham \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
