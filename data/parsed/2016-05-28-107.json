  "body": "Barack Obama\u2019s former White House counsel, human rights groups and families have made a final push to pressure the US and Canada over three men who have been detained in the United Arab Emirates for nearly two years. The three men, two American Libyans and one Canadian Libyan, face a verdict on Monday in their trial before the UAE\u2019s highest court. In March, prosecutors suddenly dropped charges that the men supported terrorist groups, but charges remain that they provided supplies to groups in a foreign country and collected donations without permission.  Before that, the men were held in prisons for 505 days without charges, and family members have alleged torture including beatings, electric shocks and sleep deprivation. All three dual citizens are businessmen who had for decades traveled to and worked in the UAE without incident. \u201cIt\u2019s been nowhere close to a fair trial,\u201d said Amal Eldarat, 27, whose father Kamal and brother Mohammed are Americans who have been detained since August 2014. \u201cYou cannot just have a new charge sheet put in without any evidence and not reset a trial. They\u2019re using the old case file for the new charges.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve tried everything in our capacity,\u201d she added. \u201cNow we\u2019re just waiting for the UAE to do the right thing and to bring them home.\u201d    Related: My brother is being illegally detained in the United Arab Emirates | Mohamed Alaradi    \u201cAnyone who has looked at the case file has said confidently and publicly that there is no option but an acquittal,\u201d Marwa Alaradi, the 18-year-old daughter of Canadian Salim Alaradi, told the Guardian. \u201cAny other verdict on Monday will be a travesty.\u201d She added that after almost two years of campaigning, she hopes \u201cI can return to school and [we can] be a normal family again.\u201d  \u201cI am hoping that May 30 will represent a new light for the UAE\u2019s human rights record and a new chapter for our family.\u201d Drewery Dyke, a researcher for Amnesty International, said the UAE has presided over a trial \u201cstrewn with a catalogue of flaws and shocking human rights violations\u201d, including imprisonment for a year without charge or access to counsel. \u201cThe government seems eerily determined to convict despite expressions of concern from the UN, the governments of Canada and the US,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we will see on Monday how the UAE courts acquit themselves \u2026 Justice in the UAE is in the balance here.\u201d Eldarat said that if the court acts independently, \u201cthen my dad and my brother are going to be acquitted, without a shadow of a doubt\u201d. Even with this outcome, she said: \u201cI keep wondering if they\u2019re going to be the same father and brother that I used to know, because they\u2019ve been through so much. We have a long road ahead of us with my dad and my brother\u2019s recovery.\u201d Greg Craig, former White House counsel to Obama, has taken up the Eldarats\u2019 defense, and Canadian attorney Paul Champ represents Alaradi. The pair have appealed the men\u2019s case in a letter to Obama, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and UAE president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan.

They added that each man has suffered increasingly poor health since August 2014.  \u201cUnder any circumstances, it would be an injustice to extend their incarceration. It would, on the other hand, be a great act of mercy for you to grant their release.\u201d The US state department declined to say whether Obama raised the Eldarats\u2019 case with Nahyan, whom he met on 21 April for the US-Gulf Cooperation Council summit.  The leaders also spoke a day earlier about terrorism and stabilizing Libya. Canada\u2019s office of foreign affairs said senior officials have \u201ctaken every opportunity to raise Mr Alaradi\u2019s case\u201d with counterparts, but a spokesperson declined to comment on any action by Trudeau. Human rights groups have campaigned nearly as long as the Alaradi family for the men\u2019s release. Nick McGeehan, the regional researcher for Human Rights Watch, said that with the verdict looming, western countries had to exercise their influence on their partner in the Middle East. \u201cIt would appear these men have been subjected to a horrendous ordeal at the hands of a state that has become emboldened to the point where detaining and torturing other people\u2019s citizens isn\u2019t viewed as a diplomatic faux pas,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s time for the US and Canada to flex a little muscle of their own and insist on their release in view of the manifest unfairness of the trial.\u201d Joining the activists and lawyers are a coalition of 44 prominent international attorneys and academics. The group similarly warned that the men \u201care in present danger of serious medical complications\u201d, and said the UAE has violated basic human rights with arbitrary arrest.   Related: Two Americans detained in UAE to go on trial after 505 days without charges    \u201cMohamed has already lost full hearing in his left ear, Kamal is suffering from spinal injury and loss of motion in his body, and Salim is suffering from serious heart, kidney and prostate complications,\u201d they wrote. The General Union of Libyan lawyers and members of the Libyan community in Britain have published similar open letters to Nahyan and prime minister David Cameron. Earlier this year the UN special rapporteur on torture condemned the UAE, saying the men were tortured into confessions, and called for their unconditional release. The UAE\u2019s embassy in the US has said the men \u201care entitled to all of the due process guarantees under the constitution and laws of the United Arab Emirates in accordance with international fair trial standards.\u201d Embassy personnel declined to comment on specific allegations \u201csince the case is ongoing\u201d.",
