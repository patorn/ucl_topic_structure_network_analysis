  "body": "And so to occasional Lost in Showbiz series You\u2019re A What, Now?, which celebrates recherch\u00e9 employment arrangements. Our focus today is \u2013 would you believe \u2013 on another individual connected to the royal family. Last time it was Duchess Fergie, who had announced she was the \u201cambassador for a lifestyle app\u201d. This week, we spotlight Kate Middleton\u2019s brother James, who is CEO of a \u201cprinted marshmallow business\u201d. If you are able to say the words \u201cprinted marshmallow business\u201d without casting a Harry Hill-style sideways look to camera, I congratulate you. I also congratulate James\u2019s firm Boomf, named because of \u201cthe noise a marshmallow makes when it drops through your letterbox\u201d. (You know \u2013 THAT noise. It\u2019s literally the all-time number one search in the BBC sound effects archive.) Boomf may care to know that they are in receipt of the first ever, by-appointment Lost in Showbiz warrant, as Purveyors of Extreme WTF-ery. A look at the Boomf website finds James described as \u201cWonka in chief\u201d \u2013 nearly right \u2013 and I find myself wondering whether this is printed on the presumably marshmallow business cards he hands out to the various US breakfast shows understandably fascinated by this landmark product. And any other information he may care to share in the promotion of it. Anyway, this week\u2019s news is that after a bafflingly dicey few months, Boomf has now received almost all the investment it needs to keep trading. Far East sales are up 600%, they say \u2013 though 600% on what is unclear \u2013 and the latest innovation is a pop-up street kiosk in Hong Kong, for those moments when you need personalised marshmallows en route and you need them fast. All that remains to be said is that Boomf is fast becoming my favourite tenuously royal enterprise since Prince Edward\u2019s Ardent Productions. Nine marshmallows retail at \u00a315.",
