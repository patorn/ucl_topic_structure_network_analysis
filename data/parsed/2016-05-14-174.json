  "body": "The nine stories in Mark Haddon\u2019s debut collection are exuberant, lusty exercises in juxtaposition: intimacy and estrangement, exoticism and domesticity, innocuousness and malevolence, the cataloguing of minute detail and the expansiveness of\u00a0the zoomed-out lens. Such contrasts not only power each piece but also act as a form of call and response across them. Haddon\u2019s protagonists attempt to escape isolation while remaining intensely, covertly committed to it; his\u00a0landscapes bustle and resonate with the impact of human affairs but,\u00a0naturally, remain almost entirely indifferent to them. And the title story\u00a0suggests another of the book\u2019s recurring concerns: the collapse\u00a0of a structure representative of\u00a0imperial solidity, grandeur, leisure, prosperity. Viewed another way, it\u00a0suggests complete uselessness. \u201cThe Pier Falls\u201d freeze-frames a seaside afternoon in 1970, in a resort town apparently untouched by the seismic social shifts of the 60s and with the equally transformative events of the Thatcher era still to come (there is nothing overtly historico-political about this, and yet Haddon\u2019s prose is\u00a0redolent with the tensions and particularities of England\u2019s recent history). As promenaders eat pineapple fritters against the backdrop of paint-peeling balustrades, \u201ca rivet fails\u201d, and a catastrophe begins. Its inexorable unspooling \u2013 minute by minute, death by death \u2013 is recounted in a way that captures the lightning speed and agonising slow motion of disaster, the way in which it is simultaneously filmically recognisable to us\u00a0and utterly aberrant. Those on shore stare in bewilderment, fear mixing with a frisson of excitement; on the pier, an elderly woman who has suffered a fatal heart attack appears simply to have nodded off. The narrative proceeds by simile, as\u00a0though plainly stated fact is not sufficient: the\u00a0stricken pier issues a\u00a0noise like \u201ca\u00a0redwood being felled\u201d; a\u00a0woman shakes her unconscious husband \u201cas if he has overslept and is late for work\u201d; a hypothermic teenager sinks repeatedly beneath the water, until finally \u201cthere is so little left\u00a0of his mind that he lets it\u00a0go as easily as if it were a book falling from\u00a0his sleeping hand\u201d. Death can be humdrum, even when it is spectacular. The characters in \u201cThe Pier Falls\u201d remain almost entirely unknown to us;\u00a0elsewhere, we get a little closer. In\u00a0\u201cBunny\u201d, a morbidly obese\u00a0young man is kept company by his models of\u00a0the Afrika Korps and view of\u00a0next door\u2019s motorhome. Love appears to flourish when Leah, one\u00a0of\u00a0several grown-up children in\u00a0the\u00a0collection who return to an unsatisfactory parental home, hoves into view armed with junk food and ready meals. Its ambivalent exploration of appetite and satiety \u2013 and its highly ambiguous conclusion \u2013 make it\u00a0a horribly disquieting read. It also speaks to two other stories, \u201cThe Gun\u201d and \u201cBreathe\u201d, in which small-town, post-industrial England butts up against its more rural past. In\u00a0the first, two boys stray to the edge of their estate and into some woods \u2013 \u201cThe bubbling runs of a blackbird\u2019s call. An empty pack of pork scratchings trodden into cracked and powdery earth\u201d \u2013 in an ill-conceived adventure that ends with a deer being butchered on the top floor of a council tower-block. In \u201cBreathe\u201d, a woman on the run from a\u00a0relationship gone wrong returns from the US: \u201cThe train clatters\u00a0north from Euston. The deep chime of\u00a0the familiar. Chained dogs in\u00a0scrapyards, level crossings, countryside like\u00a0a postcard, all her history lessons written on the landscape, Maundy money and \u2018Ring a\u00a0Ring o\u2019\u00a0Roses\u2019.\u201d \u201cBreathe\u201d, a pained exploration of mother-daughter relationships and the danger of equating the feminine with nurture, gives way to a wonderfully imagined Victorian story of derring-do that foregrounds masculinity. Other stories, too, take us far away from the everyday \u2013 to space, to an island that bears a close resemblance to Naxos, where Ariadne was abandoned by Theseus \u2013 to probe deeply into the strangenesses of solitude and the unpredictability of inner resources. But nowhere do all these themes come together more brilliantly than in the collection\u2019s centrepiece, \u201cWodwo\u201d, a story that extends to more than 60 pages and earns every one of them. A\u00a0notional Christmas story \u2013 middle-class siblings and their families converge on their recently retired parents\u2019 countryside home for decent wine, smoked salmon quiche and competitive bickering \u2013 becomes a loose reworking of Gawain and the Green Knight. The heart of that medieval story is the idea of repaying a\u00a0debt of violence, and of the courtly ideal tested against something altogether wilder. Haddon\u2019s updated version highlights even more strongly issues of masculinity, of parental expectation and filial inadequacy, of\u00a0contemporary society\u2019s obsession with class and race (his \u201cGreen Knight\u201d is a black man with a shotgun and an assumption-confounding accent that is\u00a0neither Trinidad nor Hackney). It is one of the best new stories I\u2019ve read for\u00a0years; and if I were its publisher, I\u00a0would bind it up in a special edition and sell it to families at Christmas to make them feel better about their own\u00a0problems. \u201cWodwo\u201d, like many of the pieces here, also disrupts narrative time by throwing forward to characters\u2019 fates, undercutting our investment in their present with a chilly wave to the future. My favourite such example, in\u00a0\u201cThe Gun\u201d, could almost stand as a\u00a0capsule review of this terrifically compelling collection: \u201cHalfway through the meeting a cow will fall through the roof and it won\u2019t be anywhere near as funny as it sounds.\u201d \u2022 To order The Pier Falls for \u00a312.99 (\u00a316.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
