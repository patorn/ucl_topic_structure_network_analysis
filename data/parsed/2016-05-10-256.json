The publicly owned broadcaster, which appears to have successfully fought off an attempt at full privatisation by the government, increased its total revenues by more than 4% to a record \u00a3979m. Digital revenues grew 30% to \u00a382m following the relaunch of its video-on-demand service as All 4. Channel 4\u2019s main channel, which in 2014 saw its audience share hit a 31-year low, bounced back to report its first increase in audience share since 2006.   Related: Government drops full Channel 4 privatisation \u2013\u00a0but may sell off stake    Hit shows such as Gogglebox, and reality series Hunted and The Island with Bear Grylls, helped the main channel to a marginal audience share increase, from 5.87% to 5.92%. However, the broadcaster\u2019s overall portfolio, including channels such as E4, Film4 and More4, saw its share of audience decline from 10.9% to 10.6%. Nevertheless, the broadcaster\u2019s performance was deemed good enough by its board to award almost maximum payouts for its top executives, 34% of a possible 40% of their salaries under its remuneration scheme. Channel 4\u2019s top four executives, including chief executive, David Abraham, and creative chief, Jay Hunt, received \u00a3595,000 in bonus payouts. Abraham received a total salary of \u00a3881,000 \u2013 almost double the \u00a3455,000 taken home by BBC director general, Tony Hall \u2013 including a \u00a3188,000 bonus and \u00a3138,000 in cash paid out in lieu of money put into a pension scheme. Hunt received a total of \u00a3612,000, including a bonus of \u00a3139,000 and cash in lieu of pension top-up, of \u00a362,000. Channel 4\u2019s top four executives, who include sales chief, Jonathan Allan, and marketing and communications chief, Dan Brooke, took home \u00a32.5m last year. Because of Channel 4\u2019s unique status its remuneration committee does not award bonuses on the metrics most other companies use, such as looking at factors including total shareholder returns. Instead bonuses \u2013 or variable pay \u2013 are linked to \u201ccreative achievement and financial sustainability\u201d. \u201cWe are doing all this in a climate of some uncertainty about the future of Channel 4, as the government considers options for our future,\u201d said Abraham in a statement in the broadcaster\u2019s annual report published on Tuesday. \u201cWhatever the outcome of that process, the Channel 4 team and I remain focused on ensuring we run the organisation in a way that best delivers our remit and maintains our financial stability, building on all the success of 2015.\u201d The government is still looking at potential plans for Channel 4, including selling a minority stake, and potentially moving its London HQ to Birmingham or Manchester. Channel 4 spent a record \u00a3629m on all programming and content last year, with\u00a3455m of that on original content. It made a post-tax surplus of \u00a326m \u2013 it is a not-for-profit broadcaster \u2013 and said that \u00a320m of that would be allocated to the \u201ccontent reserve for future creative investment to protect the long-term delivery of our remit\u201d. The broadcaster said it has increased its total cash fund reserve by \u00a330m to \u00a3252m. Channel 4 saw its total revenues from ad sales, including for third parties such as Dave and Gold owner, UKTV, and BT Sport, increased to \u00a31.17bn.",
