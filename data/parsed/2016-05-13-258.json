But don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a plan \u2013 some of the best careers are decided off the cuff.  Take recent University of Exeter graduate, Joanna Freeman, who didn\u2019t know what she wanted to do until after she graduated. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose my career,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to go into marketing but ended up doing a graduate scheme at a communications company. I fell into it. I was lucky that it turned out to be exactly what I was looking for, because I hadn\u2019t heard of internal communications before.\u201d Whether you have your entire career mapped out, or don\u2019t know where to start, here\u2019s our guide to having confidence in your future and getting where you want to be.

For others it isn\u2019t so clear cut and graduating can feel like a step into the unknown. \u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d says Hannah Morton-Hedges, founder of Momentum Careers Advice. \u201cThese decisions can take a long time to make and get right. Think long and hard about your career values and what you want. How important is money, for example? Or helping others in your work? Would you benefit from a very structured role or do you crave the freedom to work your own way? Choosing a job that clashes with your values is unlikely to keep you satisfied for long.\u201d Start by looking at activities you enjoy doing, says Jon Gregory, a graduate careers adviser and coach. \u201cIf that\u2019s reading magazines, work out what about that is interesting to you. Is it fashion related, travel, film appearances, the public or social opportunities? What jobs would lead you into that world? Perhaps clothing or cosmetic design, event management, public relations or marketing.\u201d Graduate careers adviser Corinne Mills adds that you need to try out different careers before you know for certain what you want to do. \u201cThe reality of the job and the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day work is often different to the idea. So my advice is to speak to people who do jobs that interest you and try to get as much experience as you can.\u201d Building up your CV and experience Once you\u2019ve narrowed down your graduate job hunt to a particular role or industry, you need to build up the skills that would be appealing to a potential employer. \u201cAnything you can do to show that you understand what the job you\u2019ll be applying for is really like will be a major bonus,\u201d says Gregory. Another (often dreaded) part of looking for a graduate job is having the confidence to network. \u201cAt university there should be opportunities to meet employers, attend workshops and find out about the world of work,\u201d says Morton-Hedges. \u201cStart by thinking about the people around you \u2013 friends and family \u2013 who may be able to help you get a foothold into their industry.\u201d Once you have a little bit of experience on your CV, doors will open more easily.

Confidence comes from knowing \u2018I did this and it went well\u2019,\u201d says Mills. Once you\u2019ve managed a project or demonstrated these skills it will boost your confidence. Morton-Hedges agrees that having experience of successfully using your skills will grow your confidence when job hunting. \u201cBe proactive and seek out opportunities to gain experience and get involved. Don\u2019t forget that we are developing transferable skills all the time, whether through our studies, through responsibilities we take on or through any part-time jobs. It is also really important to remember that employers won\u2019t be expecting the finished article at this stage in your career so try not to worry about not meeting expectations.\u201d Ultimately, you need to be kind to yourself and not pile on too much pressure to find a job when you graduate. \u201cStay realistic,\u201d says Morton-Hedges. \u201cDon\u2019t pressurise yourself to choose a career for life. Sometimes jobs work out for the long run, other times they don\u2019t. What\u2019s important is that we learn from our experiences. Career success can often be a case of the tortoise and the hare \u2013 those that get off to a flying start won\u2019t always reach the finish line first.\u201d Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents \u2013 and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.",
