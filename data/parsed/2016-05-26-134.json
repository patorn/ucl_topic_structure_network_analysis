  "body": "The mere mention of a bank holiday is enough to invite it to pour with rain this weekend, but let\u2019s assume, against our better judgment, that there might be some barbecuing, maybe even a picnic. What\u2019s the best kind of wine to drink outdoors?     Aldi\u2019s Touraine Sauvignon Blanc: serve with goat\u2019s cheese salad.    It has already been established that altitude affects our tastebuds, but what about the open air? I\u2019ve never seen scientific evidence that it does, and all I could find when I Googled the subject was \u201cwine and plastic cups is not a perfect pairing\u201d, but I\u2019m sure there must be an effect. It\u2019s certainly not an occasion to linger over a glass, analysing its every facet, rather one for enjoying a simple wine with bright, fruity flavours (ideally one sealed with a screwcap, because someone, usually me, is bound to have forgotten to bring the corkscrew). Sauvignon hits the spot. Bargain Booze, should you be able to bring yourself to walk through its doors, has the perfectly decent, crisp, citrussy Frontera Sauvignon Blanc 2015 (12.5% abv), from Chile\u2019s Central Valley, at \u00a34.49, while Aldi has a 2015 Touraine Sauvignon Blanc (12% abv), in its \u201cExquisite\u201d range, at \u00a35.29 (or \u00a331.74 for a case of six online), which makes a passable substitute for sancerre. (Free delivery, too, at the moment: Aldi\u2019s obviously keen to build up its mailing list.) The bright, breezy Bleasdale Langhorne Crossing Verdelho-Sauvignon (\u00a36.95 The Wine Society; 12.5% abv) would do the job, too \u2013 it\u2019s a \u201csuper everyday fridge door wine\u201d, as they describe it in winesocietyspeak. (Who uses the word \u201csuper\u201d these days?) If you\u2019re looking for a cheap and cheerful red for a bank holiday barbie, Aldi\u2019s Stellenbosch Cape Red 2015 (\u00a35.99, or \u00a335.94 by the case; 14.5% abv), a beefy blend of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon, grenache and mourv\u00e8dre, would fit the bill, as would Asda\u2019s exuberant Wine Atlas Cigales 2013 (\u00a35.97; 14% abv), which is a robust alternative to rioja. Cabernet franc is my own picnic red of choice. I normally head for the Loire section of the shelves, but the fragrant, juicy Domaine Mas Barrau Cabernet Franc 2014 (\u00a37.90 Booths, \u00a37.99 Palmer\u2019s Wine Store, Bridport; 13.5% abv), from the Pays du Gard, is tempting enough to steer me off my usual course (John Hattersley has the 2015 for \u00a37.95). Finally, if it is really hot outside, it\u2019s got to be ros\u00e9, hasn\u2019t it? If you like the Provence style, but not so much the price tag, try Les Calandi\u00e8res Mediterran\u00e9e ros\u00e9 (12% abv), a satisfyingly dry, savoury blend of cinsault, grenache, syrah, cabernet sauvignon and merlot. It\u2019s just \u00a36.99 from Wine Rack and Bargain Booze, and equally good indoors. matchingfoodandwine.com",
