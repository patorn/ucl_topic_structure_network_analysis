  "body": "Overwhelming and heart-breaking was how Rachel Notley, the Alberta premier, described the destruction left behind in the wake of a wildfire that continues to rage out of control in northern Alberta.   Related: Alberta wildfires leave Fort McMurray charred and desolate \u2013\u00a0in pictures    \u201cI was very much struck by the power of the devastation of the fire,\u201d Notley said after touring the city of Fort McMurray on Monday. \u201cIt was really quite overwhelming in some spots.\u201d Last week more than 88,000 residents frantically evacuated the oilsands city after shifting winds brought a nearby forest fire to the city\u2019s doorstep. The fire swept through the city in a seemingly random path, leaving behind piles of rubble and twisted metal, burned-out pick-up trucks and charred swing sets in some neighbourhoods. In others, homes sat untouched, their green lawns sharply contrasting with the grey of the city\u2019s worst-hit areas. Some 2,400 homes and buildings were destroyed or damaged by the fire, said Notley.   Fort McMurray fire damage   For the tens of thousands of residents now scattered across the province, many of them wondering whether they have a home to return to, Notley had good news. Some 85% of the city \u2013 around 25,000 structures \u2013 had been saved. \u201cThe city was surrounded by an ocean of fire only a few days ago,\u201d said Notley. \u201cBut Fort McMurray and the surrounding community have been saved and it will be rebuilt.\u201d But she cautioned: \u201cThat of course doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t going to be some really heartbreaking images for some people to see when they come back.\u201d The fire has not completely released its grip on the city, said Notley. \u201cThere are smouldering hotspots everywhere. Active fire suppression is continuing.\u201d The wildfire continues to grow in the region, albeit at a much slower pace. By Monday it had swelled to 204,000 hectares \u2013 an area more than 22 times the size of Manhattan \u2013 but winds were pushing it east, away from communities. It now sits some 25km from the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan.  Cooler weather helped crews continue to keep the fire at bay, away from Fort McMurray, Anzac and the Suncor Energy oilsands facility. Currently more than 700 firefighters are battling against the blaze, with another 300 expected to arrive in the area shortly. \u201cThis fire is burning out of control out there, it still is, but we are holding the line where we need to, at least for today,\u201d said Notley.

As the fire destroyed homes and engulfed neighbourhoods, Darby Allen described it as a \u201cnasty, dirty\u201d fire. On Monday the local fire chief added another adjective to the list: unprecedented. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the fire conditions and the way the fire behaves, no one\u2019s ever seen anything like this. They\u2019re rewriting their formulas on how fires behave, based on this fire.\u201d Allen singled out a local firefighter who fought the blaze as it consumed his own home and who continued working for another 22 hours, and a colleague who \u2013 with just a handful of people, a flashlight and some phone calls \u2013 managed to evacuate 450 residents in Anzac after the fire caught officials off-guard and swept into the community. \u201cThat is true heroism, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d said Allen. Earlier in the week, officials swiftly moved some 25,000 evacuees north of Fort McMurray to the province\u2019s largest cities in mass airlifts and convoys. On Monday, the first of a different kind of convoy made its way to Edmonton, reuniting owners with the pets left behind during the hurried evacuation.

On Tuesday the Alberta government will meet with meet key players in the province\u2019s energy sector to assess the extent of the impact and get a sense of how long production could be disrupted. The oil sands in Alberta rank among the world\u2019s largest reserves of oil, after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.  The past week has seen governments around the world \u2013 including the United States, Australia and Mexico \u2013 offer assistance in battling the wildfire. Last week the Russian government joined in, offering to send heavy water bombers and specialised firefighting crews. On Monday, Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said the aid would not be necessary. \u201cThe good news is from the support we\u2019ve seen from Canadians across the country \u2026 there is no need to accept any international assistance at this point, but we certainly thank everyone for their generosity.\u201d",
