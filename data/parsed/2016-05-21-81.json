  "body": "Related: Watching the watchers: Oakland seeks control of law enforcement surveillance    Olga Cortez was getting out of the shower and preparing for bed when she heard a loud banging outside. It was 9.30pm on 7 December, and the Oakland, California, mother saw a man she did not recognize furiously pounding on her front door. \u201cOpen the fucking door,\u201d he screamed, according to Cortez\u2019s account. \u201cLet me in!\u201d When her husband Nemesio cracked open the door to ask him to leave, the man, who smelled strongly of alcohol, allegedly kicked him in the stomach and grabbed Olga, who was wearing a bathrobe and fell to the ground \u2013 exposing her body. Another man came running out of their backyard and appeared to point a gun at the wife.  Their daughters, ages 11 and 13, stood in the doorway crying. The traumatizing incident, outlined in a claim to the city, got worse when the Oakland police department (OPD) showed up. The officer wanted the couple to \u201csanitize their story\u201d, asking them if the man \u201cwas simply knocking\u201d on the door and had inadvertently pushed Olga \u201cwhile falling down\u201d. The bizarre line of questioning only made sense when OPD lieutenant Roland Holmgren later revealed to Olga the identities of the two suspects: They were Oakland cops who, according to the lieutenant, were just \u201cbeing silly\u201d and \u201cmistakenly went to her house\u201d looking for a party, the claim alleges. The ensuing scandal is just one among numerous misconduct cases plaguing the police department in Oakland, the city across the bay from San Francisco that has long been at the center of contentious debates about crime, gentrification and race relations.  Although presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump recently called the city one of the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d places in the world, some say the real danger in Oakland is its police.  This week, four officers were caught up in a national controversy centered on accusations that a cop may have murdered his wife in a case that has exposed allegations of sexual misconduct by numerous officers, possibly involving sex with a minor. \u201cI was not surprised,\u201d Melissa Nold, the Cortez family\u2019s attorney, said of the latest scandal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying forever that there are systemic problems.\u201d The December assault was, however, particularly disturbing to Nold. That\u2019s because OPD sergeant Joseph Turner, who allegedly trespassed in the family\u2019s backyard, appeared to be out partying with cops that night \u2013 just two weeks after he had killed a man in a shooting many believed was cruel and unjustified. A notorious history Black residents began migrating in large numbers from the south to Oakland in the 1940s, but the police department did not adapt to reflect the city\u2019s diversity, and racial tensions escalated. In the 1960s, Oakland became the birthplace of the Black Panther movement after growing police harassment and brutality, and in 1968, anger at OPD boiled over when cops killed a 17-year-old member.

Photograph: Reuters    Although the unrest mirrored strife in urban communities across the US, OPD established itself as one of the most notorious law enforcement agencies in the country with a 1990s corruption scandal involving a group of cops known as the \u201cRiders\u201d. The officers allegedly planted drug evidence on black residents, falsified records and brutalized suspects, leading to a 2000 federal lawsuit and court oversight of OPD that remains in effect today. \u201cThe Oakland police department is corrupt in its roots,\u201d said Cat Brooks, co-founder of the Anti Police-Terror Project, a local community group.  Despite a settlement agreement, a federal judge said he was forced to take direct control of reform efforts in 2012. Since then, there have been improvements and OPD leadership has, in recent years, begun to seek proactive solutions, said Jim Chanin, a civil rights attorney who helped initiate the Riders lawsuit. \u201cThere are people in the department who are dedicated to achieving real lasting cultural change,\u201d he said. Still, OPD disproportionately stops and searches black residents, and a court-appointed investigator continues to issue scathing reports on the department\u2019s disciplinary procedures. Some of the agency\u2019s longtime critics say they\u2019re starting to develop more faith in OPD\u2019s top cops, but they say a steady stream of controversies in recent months point to a fundamental cultural problem within the department \u2013 one that allows police to get away with unjust shootings, bad behavior and possibly even murder. \u2018Like killing animals in the street\u2019 On 15 November, Ada Perkins-Henderson, 66, stepped outside her home in East Oakland and prayed for the person lying dead in the street one block away. She had heard that Oakland police had killed another man. \u201cI said, \u2018Lord, take care of that family. That family needs you,\u2019\u201d she recalled. Later, she got a call: Her youngest son Richard was dead. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was praying for my son.\u201d According to Oakland police, Richard Perkins, 39, approached cops with a toy pistol, prompting four officers, including Turner, to simultaneously fire at him. Police were in the neighborhood responding to the weekend\u2019s huge \u201csideshow\u201d \u2013 illegal events in Oakland that draw hundreds of cars to the streets for dangerous stunts.

Photograph: Perkins family    His grieving family has seen partial surveillance footage of the shooting \u2013 which police have shown them, but refused to publicly release \u2013 and they insist that OPD\u2019s account is wrong. \u201cHe never pointed a gun at any police officer. He would never try and fight,\u201d Perkins-Henderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like killing animals in the street.\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019t believe it. We know the type of person he was,\u201d added Regina Perkins, Richard\u2019s sister, clutching the last photo she took with her brother. \u201cIt hurts so bad.\u201d  Richard Perkins was the 1,000th person killed by law enforcement in 2015, according to The Counted, the Guardian\u2019s database of police killings. He was also the fifth black man fatally shot by police in Oakland last year, including a man killed while sitting in a car.    Related: San Francisco police chief resigns in wake of fatal shootings and scandals    Neighboring San Francisco\u2019s police department has been embroiled in scandals \u2013 numerous questionable shootings and cops\u2019 racist text messages \u2013 prompting the chief to resign this week. But OPD has struggled to stay out of the spotlight.  Two weeks after sergeant Turner fired at Perkins, he allegedly showed up at the Cortez\u2019s housewith officer Cullen Faeth, who allegedly attacked the couple. Turner, who is on paid leave and has not faced charges, declined to comment. Faeth was charged with battery, trespassing and public intoxication in April and pleaded not guilty. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment and neither did Holmgren. Weeks after Faeth\u2019s charges, news broke that another Oakland cop was facing criminal charges after he allegedly pulled a gun on a painter while off-duty. One month later, it was revealed that Oakland officer Brendan O\u2019Brien may have killed his wife in 2014 in a death police said was a suicide. Two bullets were fired from O\u2019Brien\u2019s Glock 45, and a coroner said the killing was \u201csuspicious\u201d, according to local paper East Bay Express.  O\u2019Brien subsequently killed himself, allegedly writing a suicide note that launched an investigation into potential sexual misconduct and led four officers to be put on leave. Two resigned on Wednesday. A judge said in recent court documents that the case has threatened the department\u2019s progress under federal oversight and raised \u201cmost serious concerns that may well impact [OPD\u2019s] ability to demonstrate their commitment to accountability and sustainability\u201d. \u2018The most dangerous place in America\u2019 Libby Schaaf, who was elected mayor of Oakland in 2014, said she was appalled to learn of the recent sexual misconduct allegations.  \u201cI\u2019m pissed off that these officers allegedly \u2026 did such a dishonor to their city, to their department and to their profession,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m very angry to hear that anyone who\u2019s taken on the mantle of being a guardian of the community could conduct themselves in this way.\u201d     Oakland protester Biseat Yawkal is pushed by police during a demonstration outside of the California Republican party convention in Burlingame last month. Photograph: Leah Millis/AP    Police chief Sean Whent said it was wrong to say there\u2019s a culture of impunity within OPD. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate when these things happen, but ... we absolutely do hold people accountable.\u201d  He said there was \u201cno type of coverup\u201d in the alleged assault in December, that he was \u201cvery confident\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s wife\u2019s committed suicide, and that the five killings last year were justified. He also noted that the recent cases stemmed from off-duty behavior, not on-duty misconduct. \u201cI don\u2019t follow cops when they\u2019re not at work.\u201d \u201cWe need to strengthen our system for monitoring off-duty conduct,\u201d Schaaf said. Schaaf and Whent have argued that the agency has become a leader in reform through training aimed at combating racial profiling, improvements in how police communicate with residents, and by overseeing a sharp drop in cops\u2019 use of force. Despite clear progress since the corruption of the Riders case, anxieties about racial profiling, misconduct and brutality have in some ways become more acute in recent years, with fears that police mistreatment of people of color is yet another force making a rapidly gentrifying Oakland unwelcoming to black residents. Black homeownership has dropped substantially in Oakland in recent years, with the overall proportion of African Americans declining by nearly 40% between 1990 and 2011. Over the last year, there have also been fresh concerns about white residents, without cause, calling the police on their neighbors of color and filing complaints that increase the risk that black residents will have harmful interactions with a department that has a record of racial bias and misconduct. \u201cThe police are the shock troops of gentrification,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThey come in with \u2026 arrests, violence and brutality in addition to rising rents and other forces that are pushing out black and brown people.\u201d  Some also worry that Trump\u2019s swipe at Oakland as one of the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d cities \u2013 which led Schaaf to tweet that the \u201cmost dangerous place in America is Donald Trump\u2019s mouth\u201d \u2013 fuels the same racist fears that drive unnecessary police harassment and shootings and encourage gentrification and displacement. Distrust of cops runs deep on the streets of East Oakland, said Latonya Perkins, one of Richard Perkins\u2019s sisters.  \u201cHow am I supposed to call you when I need help,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re the same person that killed my brother?\u201d",
