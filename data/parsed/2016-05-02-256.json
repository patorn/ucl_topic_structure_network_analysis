  "body": "Pop, the cultural revolution of the late 20th century, has touched art, poetry, fiction, and everything musical, with its hot white wand. In the beginning, in the 1960s, pop was sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll: a way of life. A lot of young journalists covered it, but very few transcended the genre to create a narrative that would outlive the generation that hoped it would die before it got old. Awopbop\u2026, however, a luminously clear, aerial survey of an extraordinary phenomenon, set the gold standard that others would follow.   Related: Awopbopaloomopalopbombom! Sometimes the best lyrics mean nothing at all    Nik Cohn\u2019s dispatch from the frontline of rock is about to turn 50 (its author is now in his 70s) and is still as evergreen and wild eyed as it was when it burst on to the scene, with a snarl and a stamping foot, in 1969. Since then, many Scandinavian forests have been laid waste to describe the pop revolution, with names such as Greil Marcus, Philip Norman and Jon Savage jostling for attention at the front of a crowded field, but Nik Cohn was the first. No one had taken the subject quite as seriously as he did. There was nothing before him and there has been nothing quite as raw or as memorable since. Different, yes; sweeter, for sure; more searching, possibly; but never as fearless, flashy or straight-out thrilling. Written in a white heat, like some of the best journalism, Awopbop\u2026 supplied the last word. Here, in 250 pages, was a new form: rock criticism. This was a new kind of critical discourse, the strange fruit of a personal and passionate love affair, smoking with teenage intensity. \u201cFrom the first blast of Tutti Frutti,\u201d writes Cohn, \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll had possessed me, body and soul.\u201d From 1956 to 1968, the year Cohn signed off, he covered the \u201cfirst mad rush\u201d of a phenomenon that would eventually morph into disco, heavy metal, grunge, glam, techno, punk and many bizarre sub-genres.

Eventually, he got a job \u201cpontificating on yoof\u201d for the Observer. The celebrated record producer (and manager of the Who) Kit Lambert recalls Cohn showing up \u201cabout 1963\u201d as a \u201cthin young man \u2013 he looked about 14 \u2013 wearing carefully dirtied-down sneakers\u201d. Cohn\u2019s approach was perfectly in tune with his subject. He writes: \u201cRock in the late 60s was still a spontaneous combustion. Nobody bothered with long-term strategies; hanging on once the thrill was gone was unthinkable. If anyone had told me then that the Stones or the Who would still be treading the boards in 30-plus years, I\u2019d have thought they were out of their minds.\u201d Cohn, the son of the historian Norman Cohn, author of a cult classic, The Pursuit of the Millennium, had grown up in Ireland, but escaped to London by 1963, \u201cthe year the Beatles broke through, and the climate seemed to change by the day\u201d. The metropolitan feeding frenzy he became part of was not confined to rock\u2019n\u2019roll. He writes that \u201cnewspaper editors, book publishers, fashion mags and film financiers were all caught up in the same fever. Almost overnight, being a teen degenerate was the hottest ticket around.\u201d By the time he was 22, these heady days were done. \u201cEven as I was pigging out on the moment,\u201d Cohn recalls, \u201crock and pop were already changing. The world I knew and savoured was basically an outlaw trade, peopled with adventurers, snake-oil salesmen, inspired lunatics. But their time was almost over. The scene was becoming more industrial. Accountants and corporate fat cats were fast driving out the wild men.\u201d Before long, rock had become \u201cjust another branch of commerce, no more or less exotic than autos or detergents\u201d. Cohn\u2019s account of this \u201cmad rush\u201d is at once an elegy, a retrospective and a lingering goodbye. In 1968, he took a publisher\u2019s advance and holed up in Connemara for seven weeks to write the first draft of what would become a kind of farewell to arms. \u201cMy purpose was simple,\u201d he said later, \u201cto catch the feel, the pulse of rock, as I had lived through it\u2026 I simply wrote off the top of my head, whatever and however the spirit moved me. Accuracy didn\u2019t seem of prime importance. What I was after was guts, and flash, and energy, and speed. Those were the things I\u2019d treasured in the rock I\u2019d loved.\u201d Awopbop\u2026 was the result: subjective, unruly and unintentionally definitive. Questions about good and/or bad were afterthoughts and accidental. Cohn was riffing off memories and impressions. \u201cDid Dion\u2019s Ruby Baby have any aesthetic value?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho cared ? What it had was dirty magic \u2013 the slurred, sex-drunk vocal, those shambolic handclaps, the whole glorious unmade bed.\u201d         Dion - Ruby Baby    From Bill Haley to Jimi Hendrix, Cohn runs the gamut of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, with chapters on Elvis Presley, the twist, Phil Spector, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Bob Dylan, even the Monkees. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve written about,\u201d he concludes, \u201chas been the rise and fall of Superpop, the noise machine, and the image, hype and beautiful flash of rock\u2019n\u2019roll music. Elvis riding on his golden Cadillac, James Brown throwing off his robes in a fit, Pete Townshend slaughtering his audience with his machine-gun guitar, Mick Jagger hanging off his mike like Tarzan Weissmuller in the jungle, PJ Proby \u2013 all the heroic acts of pulp.\u201d Cohn was never American, but the wild chords of 60s\u2019 new journalism had left their mark on his style, shaping it into the perfect medium for a new kind of reportage, the journalism of correspondents in motley and denim, not mufti or combat fatigues. Finally, the last war was over, replaced by peace and love and the illusion of immortality. A signature sentence \u201cAll that\u2019s left now is the image, the vision of Elvis as he was when he was 21, 22, strutting and swaggering, hanging his grin out, putting on the agony, and freewheeling through everything.\u201d Three to compare George Melly: Revolt Into Style (1970) Greil Marcus: Mystery Train (1975) Jon Savage: England\u2019s Dreaming: The Sex Pistols and Punk Rock (1991)",
