  "body": "Climate change is known for swelling the oceans and fueling extreme weather, but it may be also causing the curious emergence of a new type of bear in the Arctic. A bear shot in the frigid expanse of northern Canada is believed to be a grizzly-polar bear hybrid, a consequence of the increasing interactions between the two imposing bear species.   Related: US ceases efforts to end global trade of polar bear parts     Hunter Didji Ishalook originally thought he\u2019d shot a small polar bear but he said it was a \u201chalf-breed\u201d \u2013 a position backed by several bear experts. The bear was shot near the small community of Arviat, located on the Hudson Bay within Canada\u2019s Arctic region.  \u201cIt looks like a polar bear but it\u2019s got brown paws and big claws like a grizzly,\u201d Ishalook said. \u201cAnd the shape of a grizzly head.\u201d  Sightings of this hybrid species \u2013 which has been dubbed either a \u201cgrolar bear\u201d or a \u201cpizzly bear\u201d \u2013 have become more common in recent years as the Arctic has warmed at twice the rate of the global average.   Grizzly bears found in Alaska and Canada appear to be moving north as their environment warms, bringing them into contact with polar bears located on the coastline.   Polar bears are spending more time on land as Arctic ice diminishes, causing them to lose body weight and decline in numbers as they are unable to hunt for favored prey such as seals.  \u201cThe combination of warmer temperatures and vegetation growth means there is more overlap between the species and I\u2019d expect that overlap to increase,\u201d Chris Servheen, a grizzly bear expert at the University of Montana, told the Guardian.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t see it much in the past but we are now. The two species are very similar genetically so males of both species will be attracted to females, which is why we are seeing a mix-up in the breeding.\u201d  Polar bears evolved from brown bears around 150,000 years ago and are now the largest land carnivores in the world, weighing up to 1,600lb (720kg). Grizzly bears, known for the distinctive hump on their shoulders, are normally solitary animals but come together to feed or to mate.  As temperatures continue to increase \u2013 the world has just broken monthly heat records for 12 months in a row \u2013 the long-term prognosis could be more favorable to the pizzly than the polar bear.  \u201cPolar bears really depend upon sea ice, they\u2019ve evolved with it and they aren\u2019t built to live on the shore long-term,\u201d said Servheen. \u201cIf the sea ice disappears, some may be successful but a lot won\u2019t be successful.  \u201cWe are looking at an evolutionary change in the long term where overlaps are increasing and polar bears don\u2019t have a lot of options. But it will be hundreds of generations before we really see a new type of bear.\u201d",
