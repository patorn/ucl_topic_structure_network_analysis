  "body": "The final three years of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s 10-year company tax plan could cost the budget almost $40bn and the total revenue forgone over the decade could exceed $60bn, according to Parliamentary Budget Office costings of similar plans revealed by Labor.   Related: Australian budget 2016: the graphs you need to see    Both parties used the final days of the 44th parliament to test run their pitches for the election campaign the prime minister will almost certainly call at the weekend \u2013 pitting \u201cfairness\u201d against \u201cclass envy\u201d.  The government is suggesting that Labor was setting the scene for a \u201cwar on business\u201d and a \u201cwar on aspiration\u201d by opposing the tax cuts, and a \u201cclass war\u201d by proposing to retain the 2% deficit levy for people earning more than $180,000.  Labor claims the government is \u201cout of touch\u201d and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, will on Thursday night use his televised budget reply speech to highlight what he says is the disparity between the government\u2019s tax cuts for high-income earners and big business versus their embrace of Tony Abbott\u2019s cuts to payments and support for working- and middle-class families. The prime minister said on Wednesday that if re-elected he would immediately present legislation to implement the full 10-year plan of its company tax cuts \u2013 the centrepiece of Scott Morrison\u2019s budget, but the government has only released costings for the first four years - which would forgo $5.3bn in revenue. Labor has revealed separate PBO costings of various levels of company tax cuts \u2013 to 27%, 26% and 25%.  It shows that in 2024-25 a cut to 27% would cost $8.7bn, that a cut to 26% in 2025-26 would cost $12.45bn and a cut to 25% in 2026-27 would cost $16.45bn.  The costings are only an indication of the possible revenue forgone and do not cover the three years following the four estimates in which the government is proposing to gradually increase the threshold for the size of company that qualifies for the gradually reducing company tax rate. The treasurer repeatedly refused to reveal 10-year costings on Wednesday, saying costings were only ever provided over the budget\u2019s four-year forward estimates, but Labor insisted voters should know the cost of the budget\u2019s central promise. Labor has said it will oppose most of the government\u2019s company tax cut plan, which will reduce all business tax rates to 25% by 2026, as soon as possible if it is re-elected. The government promised to cut the small business tax rate from 28.5% to 27.5% and extend the eligibility to businesses with turnovers of up to $10m, also from 1 July. The lower rate will be gradually phased in for larger businesses until it covers all companies in 2023, and the government is promising to reduce the rate to 25% in 2026.

Asked whether the 10-year plan was aspirational and uncosted, as Labor suggested, Turnbull said: \u201cNeither of those points is correct. It is a commitment; it is a plan. \u201d Asked whether business tax cuts could be legislated for the full 10 years, Turnbull responded: \u201cAbsolutely, of course it can be. The legislation will enable us to deliver those cuts into the future. Obviously a future parliament could change that.\u201d Turnbull said on Wednesday high-income earners deserved to have the deficit levy lifted because they were being hit by the government\u2019s changes to superannuation concessions. Morrison has defended the budget\u2019s failure to offer any tax relief to families earning between $37,000 and $80,000 by saying they had retained the tax cuts offered as compensation for Labor\u2019s carbon tax, even after the carbon tax was abolished.",
