  "body": "Leaving the EU could put \u00a3250bn of British trade at risk, former chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling has claimed, saying negotiating new free-trade deals with key export markets could take an average of six years. Britain exports \u00a3637bn worth of goods and services to other EU member states and more than 50 countries with which the EU has free trade agreements (FTAs), according to analysis for Britain Stronger in Europe, the official campaign to keep Britain in the EU at the 23 June referendum. Switching to less preferential World Trade Organisation rules \u2013 the stopgap arrangement Brexit campaigners suggest would be in place while talks on new trade deals get under way \u2013 could jeopardise more than a third of that trade, or \u00a3250bn, as tariffs on British exports increased, the campaign claimed.   Related: Alistair Darling: Brexit would risk collapse of confidence in UK economy    \u201cThose wanting to leave the EU want to pull Britain out of the single market, which would mean introducing tariffs and barriers to our trade and putting billions of vital trade at risk,\u201d Darling said. \u201cThere is no trading arrangement outside the EU that gives us the free trade we rely on today. Leaving would put jobs, low prices and financial security at risk.\u201d Looking at all the FTAs negotiated by the EU since 1974, the average time taken to reach a deal was six years, the campaign found, underlining the challenge facing Britain if it sought to put in place new deals after leaving the EU. The deal with Albania \u2013 which has been cited by some in Vote Leave as an indication of the kind of relationship Britain might hope to achieve \u2013 took six years to negotiate; Israel\u2019s took eight years and Macedonia\u2019s almost five.   Brexit companion   The former chancellor is the latest in a series of politicians and economists, including Barack Obama, lined up by the remain campaign to encourage voters to reject the risks of ditching EU membership. However, Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott accused the remain campaign of underestimating the UK\u2019s ability to make its way in the world. \u201cBritain Stronger in Europe can\u2019t even be consistent or honest in their campaign to do down the British economy. Their underlying belief appears to be that Britain \u2013 the world\u2019s fifth largest economy and a nation with a great history of trading across the globe \u2013 would be an economic backwater if it wasn\u2019t for Brussels taking control of our trade deals. That\u2019s absurd.\u201d While the remain camp continues to focus primarily on the economic risks of Brexit, former EU commissioner Peter Mandelson accused leave campaigners of playing on fears about immigration, as they struggled to win over swing voters. Writing in the Guardian, Mandelson accused the justice secretary, Michael Gove, the chair of the Leave campaign, of \u201cputting truth to one side\u201d for an article he wrote in Saturday\u2019s Daily Mail warning of the risks of uncontrolled immigration, and the likelihood that Turkey will join the EU.   Related: Why is the Brexit camp so obsessed with immigration? Because that\u2019s all they have | Peter Mandelson    Mandelson said Vote Leave began the campaign determined to stick to the safer ground of the economy and leave migration to Nigel Farage, whose Ukip party has its own Leave campaign, Grassroots Out. But he claimed that as Vote Leave has struggled to win the argument, and the remain camp has edged ahead in the polls, they have decided to switch their tactics. \u201cFrom Johnson questioning President Obama\u2019s \u2018part-Kenyan ancestry\u2019 to EU immigrants being blamed for the problems in everything from British schools to our health service to our prisons, every recent Vote Leave intervention has had immigration at its heart,\u201d Mandelson said.",
