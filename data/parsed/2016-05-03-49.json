  "body": "From Girls and Outlander to Game of Thrones, showrunners are continually pushing the boundaries when it comes to sex on TV. However, Silicon Valley \u2013 on HBO, like many of the raunchiest shows \u2013 has perhaps become the first show to cause complaints with a scene of animal copulation.  Sunday night\u2019s episode featured a very graphic scene where two thoroughbred horses were seen mating on screen. In a statement subsequently released to press, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals likened the practice of mating race horses to \u201carranged rape\u201d.  Whether or not this as an appropriate term to apply to animals, the scene was startling regardless. In the episode, the show\u2019s protagonist Richard Hendricks goes to meet his company\u2019s new CEO at a horse ranch for an intense confrontation and is greeted by a stallion with an enormous erection mounting a mare.

At one point in the scene there even appears to be some bodily fluid landing on the floor of the horse stall where the two nags are going at it hammer and tongs.  Silicon Valley creator Mike Judge told the Hollywood Reporter that the equine coupling was not simulated and filmed at a horse farm in California where the process was going to happen anyway \u2013 they just allowed it to be captured for posterity. He says that HBO was not only fine with the act, but encouraged them to have more of it: \u201cI actually have an email from [senior vice-president of comedy programming] Amy Gravitt where she said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but can we have more screen time with the horses having sex?\u2019\u201d   Related: Silicon Valley: the whip-smart satire that's Mark Zuckerberg's favourite show    Putting Peta\u2019s objections to one side, the explicit depiction of equine ecstasy worked perfectly for the scene, making Richard uncomfortable and giving his adversary the upper hand. It was also funny, awkward and a daring moment for the show, even if it made many uncomfortable.  Fans had many different reactions on Twitter, from thinking it was hilarious to being slightly disturbed \u2013 but no one said that they would no longer pony up for their cable subscription.     So the wife & I watched this week's Silicon Valley last night & all she could say at the end....\"that poor horse, I can't unsee that\"\u2014 KC Bubba (@bdentrek) May 3, 2016      laughed myself horse watching latest episode of silicon valley\u2014 Ian McLaren (@iancmclaren) May 3, 2016      Whoa!
