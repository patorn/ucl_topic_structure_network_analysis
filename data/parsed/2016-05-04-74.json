  "body": "While labradors may be genetically more interested in food (Greedy labradors can blame it all on genes, 3 May), sadly we are seeing more and more overweight dogs of all breeds. Obese dogs are more prone to health problems such as heart disease and diabetes and by feeding them treats, we risk killing our pets with kindness. Other than for training, treats\u00a0are not essential \u2013 and a chocolate digestive for a Jack Russell is the equivalent of a portion of chips for a person. So resisting the soulful eyes is one of the best things you can do to keep your pet healthy.Caroline ReayChief veterinary surgeon, Blue Cross pet charity, Burford, Oxfordshire \u2022 While it\u2019s always good to see the Guardian speaking up for whistleblowers (Truly unauthorised disclosures are an act of resistance, 3 May), what a pity there was no room for a tip of the hat to Sarah Tisdall, who provided you with a major scoop about US cruise missiles arriving at Greenham Common back in the 1980s. What happened to her again?Tony HarcupAuthor of The Oxford Dictionary of Journalism, University of Sheffield \u2022 Re the letter \u201cHS2 should be run by the French\u201d (4 May), during a recent trip to Japan, I had a running joke that Japanese Railways should be invited to the UK to run anything \u2013 NHS, railways, whatever came to mind \u2013 such was the efficiency and punctuality of their trains. So just hand over the whole network to them, and enjoy.Se\u00e1n O\u2019ConghaileLondon \u2022 I was amused by Mike Rowe\u2019s account (Letters, 4 May) of his primitive cash card. I regularly, in the 1960s, I got cash on a Saturday by buying clothes in Marks & Spencer, paying by cheque, returning them virtually instantly, and getting a cash refund. Irene McKenzieOxford \u2022 If Milton Keynes is a perfectly planned paradise (Letters, 4 May), why doesn\u2019t it have a proper bus station like Bedford and Northampton, its unplanned neighbours?Bill TordoffBedford \u2022 The wild and unspoilt places in Britain will become less so if you publish supplements about them (30 April).Michael CunninghamWolverhampton \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
