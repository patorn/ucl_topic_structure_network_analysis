  "body": "Spoiler alert: this recap assumes you\u2019ve seen the fifth episode of Undercover. Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t.Maya Cobbina, the pinnacle of probity and the most prestigious lawyer in the land, just flashed her boobs at a raving unhinged racist for intel. We know you\u2019re desperate to crack the Michael Antwi case, Maya, but some decorum, please.  Aside from Boobgate, we did actually gain a fair whack of essential info in this week\u2019s penultimate episode \u2013 although 94% of us probably gave up caring about Antwi and Rudy Jones and Nasty Nick weeks ago. We learned that the raving racist Peter Mackie (in a brilliantly deviant turn by Ian Peck) was ordered by \u201cthe CIA\u201d to kill Antwi; that Antwi actually died from positional asphyxiation after being held down by the police, who took his struggle as resistance rather than a lack of oxygen \u2013 a scene with sinister echoes of Eric Garner. We learned that Trimble was the police officer who put Antwi in the cell with Mackie \u2013 though the man Maya should be going after is of course our mystery Scotsman, who has masterminded the 20-year cover-up. We learned that undercover cop Nick and Maya\u2019s life together seems as good as over, after she threw down the gauntlet (in one of a string of strong bedroom-bound two-handers) and called him a rapist who stole a dead child\u2019s identity and her entire life \u2013 fair assessments all. Nick\u2019s also being tailed by Julia\u2019s hardy journo sidekick Alex Brady, the only person who seems capable of blowing this whole thing open. And in case we hadn\u2019t gathered already, Maya twigs that the cases in London and Louisiana are (stop the press) connected.      The mystery Scotsman is into something huge and transatlantic. Photograph: BBC    So we\u2019re finally getting somewhere, and we know the mystery Scotsman and the minister of justice are into something huge and transatlantic \u2013 but is an hour enough time to reveal all, while still giving us a passably tense series end? Aren\u2019t we being drip-fed too slowly to expect a satisfying conclusion? Indeed, is there anything at this point that could give us one? My main worry is that it\u2019ll be so inconclusive the BBC will have to commit to a second series. Over in Louisiana, where Maya is trying to get Rudy a stay of execution, the wildly unconvincing legal scenes deliver a Bible\u2019s worth of fire and brimstone talk about heaven (\u201cmore beautiful than any one of us can imagine\u201d) and hell (\u201cwhich of us is going to burn?\u201d). Talk, I imagine, we all wish we\u2019d been spared. What happened to the Peter Moffat of Silk? While attempting to get a pardon for Rudy\u2019s life, Maya insisted to the judge that her relationship with him had a language \u201cnever diminished by cliche\u201d \u2013 then talked in a torrent of them (\u201clife is short\u201d, \u201che taught me how to find beauty in an eight-foot cell\u201d) to lay out her case.      A Bible\u2019s worth of fire and brimstone chat \u2026 Maya tries to get Rudy a stay of execution. Photograph: Sally Mais/BBC    It was only after we heard the prison guard lie creepily about Rudy being aroused by Maya\u2019s daughter Clem that we realised Rudy\u2019s saviour was sitting right outside. After Clem rushed from the courtroom, she was soothed by Vernon Early \u2013 Rudy\u2019s alibi for the murder of a white politician, who\u2019s come forward at last, after years of police threats, as if by magic. Maya may have lost her appeal \u2013 but, armed with this new ammo, she can go even bigger and take his case before the Supreme Court. Maybe she\u2019ll overturn the whole US constitution in the series finale!  Back in London, poor Dan is trying to do seven solid minutes of press-ups. When he fails \u2013 only reaching a downright heroic six and a half minutes \u2026 close, so close! \u2013 he realises his dad\u2019s a liar, follows him to the park, spots him with his handler, feeds the handler intel that gets Vernon Early killed, then meets a girl named Lola who simply must be another copper. His chat-up line (\u201cYou\u2019re white, really white\u201d) was especially sweet. Please don\u2019t break his heart, you undercover bint. \u2018Go big\u2019 speech of the week Maya brings out the big guns to Nick: \u201cYou\u2019re still doing it aren\u2019t you? You tell them everything and you tell me nothing. You have chosen. What kind of monster are you?\u201d Cue Nick trying to prove his true love for her by rushing downstairs, grabbing his dad\u2019s ashes from the kitchen cupboard and shaking them in her face while weeping.  Notes and observations     The axis of evil, who\u2019ve plotted a 20-year cover-up. Photograph: BBC    \u2022 Why did the minister of justice pick his pen up off the floor in such a bizarre way? And why are these the things my mind dwells on when it should be fixated on the storylines? \u2022 Why did Maya not go home from the airport with Clem to drop her bags off before she schlepped round Highgate Cemetery to find Nicholas Johnson\u2019s gravestone? And Nick \u2013 if you\u2019re going to steal someone\u2019s identity, don\u2019t pick a grave so close to the path. Go a few rows deep at least.  \u2022 Bless Trimble for having a VHS player at the ready to show Maya the only remaining tape of the day Antwi died. Why didn\u2019t she visit him, or Rose, or Mackie, years ago? What\u2019s been the hold-up?  \u2022 At last, someone calls Maya out on her driving! And yet \u2026 she does it anyway.  \u2022 So Lola is the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that our mystery Scotsman has taken out on the whole Johnson family. What could this mean? Is she a ninja assassin who\u2019s going to have sex with Dan then butcher the bunch of them? \u2022 Nick\u2019s even less convincing as a writer than we all thought if his prewritten and rehearsed lines to keep his wife are: \u201cNobody can know the truth\u201d and \u201cI have looked into the smiling faces of our kids and been terrified that they would find out.\u201d \u2022 If Maya\u2019s old boyfriend Big Ray turns out to be the crux of this whole thing, I\u2019m writing a letter of complaint.  \u2022 Ditto if Clem falls in love with the anti death-penalty man Mark and moves to America. \u2022 I couldn\u2019t believe Nick swore on both Rocco the dog and his own son\u2019s life that he\u2019d never lied about anything else. This was never going to end well for Dan.\u2022 A great pay-off line from Maya about the shock death of Vernon Early: \u201cYou did this. Who\u2019s next, Nick?\u201d Who\u2019s your money on for the finale? If Dan doesn\u2019t make it out alive, it will make me miffed above all else.",
