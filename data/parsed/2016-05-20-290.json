But this doesn\u2019t mean your branding has to suffer \u2013 you just have to make every penny count when developing your company\u2019s image, tone of voice and public persona. Jo Graham is a brand consultant and writer who helps companies define what they stand for, and make it meaningful for their customers, employees and other stakeholders. She says voice is very important when it comes to setting your business apart from others in a crowded market. The brands with the most unique voices \u201cunderstand how they can make their customers\u2019 lives better and focus everything around that \u2013 from what they do, to what they say, to where and how they say it,\u201d says Graham.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about being the quirkiest, or the loudest, or the coolest \u2013 it\u2019s about integrity, relevance and consistency.\u201d    Be brave and be original  Ellie Pamphilon     Human connection is the bread and butter of business, so whether you\u2019re selling shoe polish or opening a cafe, be clear about how what you\u2019re offering will enhance people\u2019s lives. See your business\u2019s size as an opportunity to develop even closer relationships with consumers, rather than a hindrance. \u201cBeing small is a massive opportunity,\u201d says Graham. \u201cDig deep within yourselves for the reason you created your business \u2013 the unsolved problem you identified, the gap you\u2019re aiming to fill.\u201d As your business grows, it\u2019s important to stay close to your consumers to ensure that your brand\u2019s voice and marketing remains relevant, Graham adds. \u201c[Stay acquainted with] what\u2019s going on in their world, how their needs, hopes and fears are changing, and what they\u2019re seeking from the brands they engage with.\u201d We spoke to three businesses with strong brand voices that fit in with their public image and story. Here\u2019s how they did it and what they learned along the way. Be authentic     \u201cWe\u2019re not old fashioned, homemade or rustic \u2013 our tone of voice reflects that honesty,\u201d say Bad Brownie founders Paz Sarmah (left) and Morag Ekanger.    Bad Brownie, a gourmet brownie company, began out of Morag Ekanger and Paz Sarmah\u2019s shared desire to create the most delicious brownies possible. They recently secured a \u00a360,000 investment on Dragon\u2019s Den. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on getting clear flavours across to customers, so we want to ensure all our communication is no nonsense,\u201d says Ekanger. \u201cWe\u2019re a modern brand that takes a classic product and brings it up-to-date in an unfussy manner and we want our voice to reflect that. We\u2019re not old fashioned, homemade or rustic \u2013 our tone of voice reflects that honesty and tries to be matter-of-fact. \u201dThe biggest difficulty comes from the fact both Paz and I come from branding and strategy backgrounds,\u201d adds Ekanger. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at what we\u2019ve done and thinking how to continually improve and change. We rebranded a year ago to bring all the elements of our brand presence together. We thought about what we stood for and what we wanted people to think when they saw Bad Brownie.\u201d  The entrepreneurs worked on the rebrand with Bloom London, an independent brand design agency, which helped keep their perfectionist tendencies to constantly revise in check. Sarmah advises fellow small business owners to think deeply about what they offer and what differentiates them from the competition. \u201cAre you modern or classic; loud or considered; quirky or safe? Write this in the brief or summary, so everyone who works with you \u2013 and for you \u2013 is clear on how to communicate.\u201d Be objective when it comes to your brand\u2019s design work, adds Sarmah. \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to base [it] on your own tastes but you have to understand that there might be something you don\u2019t like yourself but is right for the brand.\u201d Show personality     \u201cThe business is perceived as having a strong and original personality,\u201d says Ellie Pamphilon, owner and manager at Barber Streisand.    Ellie Pamphilon is the owner, manager and barber at Barber Streisand, a unisex barbershop in Clerkenwell, London. It\u2019s well-known across the capital for it\u2019s quirky name and witty voice. \u201cI haven\u2019t consciously developed a brand voice, but the business is perceived as having a strong and original personality, in terms of the name, shop environment, social media presence and website,\u201d says Pamphilon. \u201cThese evolved from having a definite idea of what I didn\u2019t want my business to be, rather than a clear idea of what it should be. On the website, for example, I didn\u2019t want photos of softly-lit washbasins and generic headshots of models lifted from the internet. I created a shop manifesto, asked the barbers to write up profiles for each other, and added a few shots of real customers and their haircuts. \u201cSocial media has been problematic,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a big Facebook user, and didn\u2019t have an Instragram or Twitter account. Our online voice has developed from me not knowing what to say, how to say it, or who I\u2019m saying it to. We have a few ongoing photo themes on Twitter. I find these fun as it requires less input.\u201d She advises against relying purely on market research when developing a brand. \u201cStart from scratch \u2013 don\u2019t be tempted to emulate existing formats just because they\u2019re successful. Don\u2019t compromise just because you get a few negative responses. Be brave and be original. If you truly like something, the chances are others will too.\u201d Seek advice      \u201cListen to your hunches,\u201d says Craig Allen, co-founder of Greedy Goat. Photograph: Tricia de Courcy Ling for the Guardian    Craig Allen is the \u201cchief goat herder\u201d at Greedy Goat, a goats\u2019 milk ice cream company making waves in the iced-dessert market. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to portray ourselves as a fun brand that doesn\u2019t take life too seriously and we\u2019ve achieved this through our colloquial tone of voice,\u201d Allen says. \u201cDespite our tone, we still try to get across important information, such as the health benefits associated with our product and the fact that we take flavour seriously. \u201cWe initially found it difficult focussing on our core market \u2013 adults interested in luxury \u2013 without alienating children, and it was difficult balancing an emphasis on flavour while also stressing the health benefits. We sought help from digital strategists Ten4 and a new marketing manager has helped streamline the product.\u201d Allen\u2019s advice to others looking to develop their brand? \u201cListen to your hunches. While you should always take on critiques and listen to customers, don\u2019t forget your gut feeling. You need to be proud of what you produce and that passion will shine through.\u201d This advertisement feature is paid for and produced to a brief agreed with NatWest, sponsor of the winning new business and business essentials hubs.",
