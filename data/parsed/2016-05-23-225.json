  "body": "The way humour reinforces national stereotypes is examined in this devised piece about an Englishman (Will Adamsdale), an Irishman (Lloyd Hutchinson) and a Scotsman (the Guardian\u2019s Brian Logan), who find themselves locked inside both a theatre and a joke. The only way to escape is by retelling the joke. But the more they tell it, the further the punchline recedes. It\u2019s a terrific conceit, and there is plenty of fun to be had along the way, as the group discover that they can\u2019t name a single famous person from Northern Ireland who isn\u2019t connected with violence, Logan\u2019s Fife-born Scotsman is urged to be more like Rab C Nesbitt, and Adamsdale\u2019s stiff English upper lip doesn\u2019t just wobble but has a full off-stage meltdown. The opening 10 minutes are deliciously clever and funny, setting up the absurdity of the situation and echoing Tom Stoppard\u2019s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, as well as Sean Foley and Hamish McColl\u2019s comedy classic Do You Come Here Often?     Pointing up the adsurdities \u2026 Brian Logan (Scottish), Lloyd Hutchinson (Irish) and Will Adamsdale (English) in The Joke. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    There\u2019s some lovely stuff in homage to the theatrical imagination, and some great gags featuring a plastic palm tree and confusion between a boy and a buoy. But the comic and the philosophical aren\u2019t sufficiently balanced in 80 likable but uneven minutes of a play that is seldom quite as funny as it could be or as thoughtful and perceptive as it must be to seriously engage with the complexities of cultural identity.   At Camden People\u2019s theatre, London, until 4 June. Box office: 020-7419 4841.",
