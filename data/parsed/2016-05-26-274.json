  "body": "When I helped out at a children\u2019s activity centre we were trained relentlessly to spot the signs of child abuse. Often the signs are subtle \u2013 shoes too small with toes clenched inside or callouses on young feet; regular complaints of a sore stomach when actually no breakfast or dinner was provided; handwriting never good enough, or lies told to avoid being reprimanded. But life is far more a series of little events that could be mistaken for anything and passed off as day to day. Warning signs for children at risk can be well hidden not only from our view but also from theirs.    Related: Volunteers and charity workers: tell us about the day you made a difference    A quiet child \u2013 the most significant pointer of something going wrong \u2013 is often overlooked. Quiet means good. A room full of quiet children allows you to be in charge. So I was unprepared when one of the quietest children finally couldn\u2019t keep quiet any longer.  It was written all over her face. All the spark had gone out of her eyes. She looked tired, as if she hadn\u2019t had any sleep. As I passed her table I casually asked if she was OK. A tear rolled down her cheek. I invited her to come outside where she could have some privacy.  I remember her looking down at the floor. I asked if there was anything I could help with. She shook her head and in fact she was correct. In that moment, I sensed whatever it was would not be revealed to me, so I gently said: \u201cIt\u2019s OK. You don\u2019t have to tell me anything. I\u2019m not nosy. But is there someone you do trust who you would like to talk to?\u201d Here eyes shot up and met mine for the first time. I\u2019ll never forget that look \u2013 it was a gaze of total empowerment. This was her chance to make it stop, once and for all and she took it. \u201cYes. I\u2019d like to speak to a social worker.\u201d   Related: Two days before he died, I helped a very sick child swim again    They talked for hours. She didn\u2019t go home that night. That was some years ago now. I saw her in town laughing with her friends the other day. I\u2019m so glad she found her happiness and sparkle again.  After that, I realised the importance of never ignoring my intuition. I could easily have overlooked that inward reticence or given up enquiring when she declined my help. I\u2019m often reminded of the motto of the group that trained me \u2013 \u201cwe will be and do for these children as we would for our own\u201d.  It moves me every time. I have no children of my own, but you can count on me to protect their wellbeing as if they were. A society with no tolerance for abuse looks like this: everyone\u2019s children are your children.
