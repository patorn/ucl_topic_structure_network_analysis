  "body": "Under the guidance of my A-level French teacher, in 1985, I read Emile Zola\u2019s short and brutish novel, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin. I can\u2019t claim to have been a very knowing teenager but, even so, I remember wondering then at the motivation of those who had set the syllabus. Did they intend simply to educate us in the ways of 19th-century naturalism or was it that, as seemed increasingly likely, they hoped to put us off adulterous sex for life? The murder of the milksop husband, Camille, by his friend, Laurent. The bite Camille gives Laurent\u2019s neck in the moments before he dies. The way guilt then destroys Laurent\u2019s relationship with Camille\u2019s wife, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, in spite of the fact that their relationship \u2013 she watched as Camille was drowned \u2013 has been bound \u201cby blood\u201d. These were not, I found, things it was easy to forget. I don\u2019t know if Stuart Urban, the writer of ITV\u2019s The Secret, is a fan of Zola. But it was of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin that I thought as I watched the final episode of his series on Friday. The similarities, as they\u2019ve been throughout, were striking. The Secret, too, is about lovers who conspire to murder, only to find that freedom has a price. Desire is the first thing to curdle and, soon after it, trust. In Zola\u2019s novel, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent cannot escape the gaze of Camille\u2019s disabled mother and her sinister cat, Fran\u00e7ois, whereas in The Secret it\u2019s the eyes of God that follow its devout protagonists around. Nevertheless, the consequences are the same: something has to give. In Th\u00e9r\u00e8se the lovers commit suicide. At the end of The Secret one of them confesses his crime to the police. There is, however, one very important difference between the two stories, which is that while Zola made his up, Urban\u2019s is based on real events. In 1991 Trevor Buchanan and Lesley Howell were killed in Coleraine, Northern Ireland, by Colin Howell and Hazel Buchanan (later Stewart), and their deaths made to look like suicide. For some years Howell and Stewart seemed to have got away with it. But in 2009, long after their relationship had ended, Howell finally admitted what he\u2019d done, first to the elders of his church, and then to police. Charged as his accomplice, Stewart pleaded not guilty. She was convicted the following year, in 2011. Both are now serving life sentences. The Secret, which detailed these events with some fidelity, was undeniably gripping television, and not only thanks to its gothic storyline; James Nesbitt and Genevieve O\u2019Reilly (as the killers) turned in performances that are likely to see them nominated for awards. All the same, it was not a series into which any viewer with half a conscience could sink indulgently, glass of Friday white in hand. A few days after the first episode screened, Howell\u2019s daughter, Lauren Bradford, wrote of her distress at the series, and at its producers\u2019 lack of concern for her family\u2019s grief. How to abandon oneself to the tension that threaded through every scene without feeling complicit in what she had called exploitation? ITV responded by saying that it believed it had been sensitive, that it had, for instance, offered the family a chance to see the series before it aired. But Bradford\u2019s circumspect, un-histrionic tone stayed with me. In its measured quietness was devastation. Following an intervention by her MP, David Cameron has agreed to see if more can be done to help families in cases like these. But what can be, really? The answer, probably, is nothing \u2013 for which, I am mostly grateful. Balance the need to protect victims\u2019 families against the need to understand, and the latter will always win; the idea of shutting down artistic investigation, regarding it only as salacious and invasive, is not one any sensible person can entertain. Think of Gordon Burn\u2019s book about Peter Sutcliffe or, more recently, Helen Garner\u2019s This House of Grief, an account of the trial for murder of Robert Farquharson, an Australian man who drowned his three children. The result of many years\u2019 work, both are restless, questing narratives that somehow bring the unfathomable and the horrifying momentarily to heel. Television can\u2019t be anything like as thorough or as lightly shaded, but it can, if it comes at these things from an angle, shed light on an aspect of a case, something ITV proved itself with its trilogy of dramas about the Yorkshire Ripper, the Moors murderers and Fred West (made in 2000, 2006 and 2011, respectively). In spite of the controversy they stirred at the time, it\u2019s hard to think of more careful films than these, no murders or sex to be seen, each telling its story not from the perspective of the perpetrator but from a minor character, someone involved but also a little apart. Turn back to The Secret, and it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to mount a similar defence. We were with Howell and Stewart almost all the time: inside their heads, their bedrooms, their underwear. The scene in which Howell, who was a dentist, sedated Stewart so he could have sex with her \u2013 a rubber mask over her mouth, she moaned with pleasure as he brought her to orgasm under the influence of gas and air \u2013 seemed gratuitous to me (and all the more so when it was duplicated moments later). As a result, the series brought no wider understanding, for all that, in seeking to understand how a man might keep such a dreadful secret. It emphasised, among other things, that Howell liked to keep his Bible in close proximity to his porn mags. The Baptist community, with its ecstatic hymns \u2013 \u201cDraw me nearer to Thy precious bleeding side!\u201d \u2013 was a mere sideshow, and an almost comical one at times. What had formed him? We never found out. Then there is the issue of time. How long is long enough? When ITV screened its film about the Moors murders, 40 years had passed; its Yorkshire Ripper drama was shown 19 years after Peter Sutcliffe\u2019s conviction, its Fred West series 11 years after his death. Five years does not seem, to me, to be very long at all in this context, and if this is a precedent, it is worrying. A bigger question, though, is why Urban could not have used elements of the Castlerock murders in some other story, thus rendering its protagonists and their families unrecognisable. In part, this may have to do with the flop-bound ITV\u2019s loss of faith in its ability to make a certain kind of drama right now. More likely, though, its roots lie in the belief that we live in a reality-led world, that audiences are more likely to fall for a story that is true. If this is so, do they have any idea how wrong they are? People like to say that the truth is stranger than fiction. Sometimes, though, fiction has a \u201ctruth\u201d that fact lacks. After all, Laurent and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se have lived and died in my mind\u2019s eye these past 31 years.",
