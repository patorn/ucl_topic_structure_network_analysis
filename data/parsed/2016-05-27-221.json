They\u2019ll be the ones worrying in the kitchen about whether their little darlings will ever leave. Purchases of single-family homes posted a whopping 16.6% jump during April over March\u2019s levels, the largest such one-month gain recorded in more than eight years, and the median price point hit a record $321,100. Prices and sales should be rising. Mortgage rates remain close to record lows, the private sector created 160,000 new jobs in April \u2013 and the national unemployment rate is now only 5%. Even taking into account all the debate over the ways in which that unemployment figure understates the actual rate (and fails to capture underemployment by swaths of the population), that\u2019s not to be sneezed at.   Still, there\u2019s one demographic group that, notably, isn\u2019t touring open houses or scouring online listings in search of their new homes. No prizes for guessing which one.  Yes, far from buying new homes, millennials increasingly aren\u2019t even renting. The proportion of this demographic \u2013 aged around 18 to 35 \u2013 who end up living with their parents has been on the rise steadily since the Great Recession, peaking at about 36%, according to the Pew Research Center.  Now, for the first time in 130 years, living with your parents has become the most common living arrangement for young men and women aged 18 to 34, Pew reported this week.    Related: Parents housing adult children: tell us about your nest that refuses to empty     No wonder voters are turning, in their millions, to \u201cprotest candidates\u201d such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, who promise (in very, very different ways) to upend the economic system as it exists today.  Historically, for the past century or so, American society has tended to favor nuclear family households: mom, dad, kids, dog or cat, etc. You\u2019d head to grandma and grandpa\u2019s for Thanksgiving and other holidays, but you didn\u2019t live there. Even if you lived on a farm and worked it with your family members, you might occupy a separate house, built when you married and established your own household. Adding a very elderly, widowed grandparent to the household when they could no longer live alone was so rare as to arouse astonished comment. Sure, it happened, but rarely.  The Great Recession has torn up the rule book. Parents lost their jobs, and sometimes their homes, and often saw their retirement savings dwindle or evaporate. Their millennial children may have been able to afford to attend college but probably graduated with a load of debt.  Where will they get the money for a down payment for a house? Their cash-strapped parents probably can\u2019t help. But where will they find the money for the monthly mortgage payments when they have outsize monthly student loan repayments to make?  Even if they didn\u2019t have student loans to deal with, the affordability problem remains. In those markets where prices have soared, making buying a home problematic even for millennials\u2019 older and more solvent peers, buying even a closet is simply out of the question. Apartment List, an online rental marketplace, ran some numbers and calculated that it would take an average of a decade for millennials to come up with the required 20% down payment to buy a home in the dozen or so most in-demand urban locales.  San Francisco distorts those results, of course: based on average starter home prices and average millennial savings rates, they\u2019d have to save for 28 years before being able to buy their first home. (By that time, of course, they\u2019d probably be worrying about financing their children\u2019s college tuition and just wouldn\u2019t bother.)      What, for instance, will happen to Home Depot if every millennial couple doesn\u2019t have their own kitchen to remodel because they\u2019re still sharing one with a bigger family unit or a group of their peers? Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    While millennials routinely answer polls as to why they aren\u2019t buying homes (or making other big consumption decisions) by saying that they are waiting until they get married, or until they can afford it (whenever that might be), what is just as striking in the Pew Research study\u2019s results is the explosion in the category referred to as \u201cother living arrangements\u201d to a level also not recorded since 1880. This is a category that Pew defines as sharing space with a grandparent, a sibling, a roommate or housemate, or living in some kind of other shared space, like a college dormitory. Instead of venturing off to live independently, or pairing up (married or just cohabiting), more than half of all millennials now opt for some kind of \u201cuntraditional\u201d living relationship once they reach adulthood, sharing their living space with a non-partner.  It\u2019s no surprise that the cities with the biggest affordability problem have been those to see the biggest boom in \u201cadult dorms\u201d, or \u201cco-living\u201d projects, in which residents have their own small rooms (sometimes shared) and then large, common spaces, such as kitchens and living rooms. Think of a cooler, millennial version of Friends.  One way or another, this is a challenge to the status quo. Politically, it serves as a constant reminder that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d simply isn\u2019t good enough any longer. Free tuition? (Forget for a moment the risk of unintended negative consequences, ranging from subsidizing wealthy students\u2019 tuition to the fact that there will be no incentive for students to graduate on time; university students in tuition-free Germany take, on average, until they are 26 to complete an undergraduate program.) Well, why not? That\u2019s just the most obvious of the populist proposals put forth by this year\u2019s presidential candidates who argue that the system itself is so flawed as to be in need of scrapping \u2013 Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. It\u2019s also a challenge to corporate interests. For every business that figures out a way to cater to this new way of living \u2013 millennials won\u2019t own cars, so Uber and Zipcar will thrive; millennials won\u2019t buy homes, so co-living projects such as those developed by WeWork might be the model of the future, not suburban developments of semi-detached houses \u2013 scores won\u2019t.  What, for instance, will happen to Home Depot if every millennial couple doesn\u2019t have their own kitchen to remodel because they\u2019re still sharing one with a bigger family unit or a group of their peers? What if, after yearning for one in their early 20s, they realize that they have existed just fine with their bikes and the occasional Zipcar rental and decide not to add to the air pollution haze?  And what if \u2013 gasp \u2013 they decide they actually like their current living arrangements and choose to find a way to remain in them, even when their economic position becomes less strained? This is, after all, the generation turning out in droves to support Sanders, and refusing to accept the political status quo. Why accept the economic status quo? Before you say, pshaw, it will never happen, stop and think. It already has, about four decades ago, when baby boomers \u2013 the last generation of this size \u2013 took both the political and the economic status quo, turned it on its head and shook it. The catalyst for what is happening today is quite different \u2013 an economic crisis rather than a war \u2013 but it\u2019s far from impossible that the combination of political and economic stressors could end up creating radically new rules of the road.",
