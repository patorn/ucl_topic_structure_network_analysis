  "body": "My wife prefers masturbation to sex\u00a0with me. This is devastating to me\u00a0and my self esteem. There are always a long list of excuses of why she doesn\u2019t feel like talking about it. She has cheated on me a few times, too, and I have forgiven her but never\u00a0forgotten. I brought up going to\u00a0see somebody to talk about it, but she won\u2019t. What should I do? Your wife is giving you a great deal of unspoken information, but it is hard for you to take in, probably because it\u2019s\u00a0painful. There must be specific reasons why you stay in a marriage with someone who not only rejects you\u00a0sexually, but also allows you to be\u00a0aware of her alternative sexual choices. If the positives of the relationship outweigh the negatives, then \u2013 like many other people in a similar bind \u2013 you may decide to continue. Plenty of people choose a sexless marriage, which is usually fine\u00a0if that\u2019s what both partners desire.\u00a0But others put up with a situation such\u00a0as yours because, deep\u00a0down, they do not believe they can ever have\u00a0a fair and equitable relationship. Think\u00a0carefully about what you truly want and need. How\u00a0important is sex to you? How important is having sex with her to you? Ask that she respect your perfectly valid and urgent need to talk\u00a0this through. Given the impasse between you, you have a right to insist\u00a0on counselling. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist specialising in sexual disorders. \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments). Each week, Pamela chooses one problem to answer, which will be published online and in print. She regrets that she cannot enter into personal correspondence.",
