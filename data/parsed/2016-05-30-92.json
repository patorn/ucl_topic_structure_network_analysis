Cook achieved the feat when he tucked Nuwan Pradeep for a boundary to midwicket from the sixth ball he faced as England closed on a series-sealing victory. The opener began needing just another five runs for his five-figure milestone, as his team set out to make just 79 to take an unassailable 2-0 series lead. A sparse crowd was there to witness his achievement, marked by Cook with a shake of partner Alex Hales\u2019 hand and then a raised bat.    The moment Alastair Cook reaches 10,000 Test runs with a classic glance off his pads. Look at that smile \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04 https://t.co/jgLHT68Xfh\u2014 England Cricket (@englandcricket) May 30, 2016    Already England\u2019s record run scorer, the 31-year-old has become the 12th player to join the 10,000 club having played 127 Tests for England and scored 28 centuries since making his debut against India in 2006. Sunil Gavaskar was the first man to reach the landmark in 1987, followed by Allan Border six years later. Steve Waugh, Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis, Mahela Jayawardene and Shivnarine Chanderpaul followed in their footsteps, with Kumar Sangakkara the last man to join the club in December 2012.

At 31 years and 157 days, Cook has displaced Tendulkar as the youngest player to reach five-figures in Tests. \u201cCook will be a top Test batsman and breaking records for a long time yet, there\u2019s no sign of him fading,\u201d said the former England captain Nasser Hussain. \u201cHis greatest thing is his stubbornness and taking the hard path. I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been an England player mentally stronger than Alastair Cook. \u201cWhen you first saw him on the field you didn\u2019t quite know who was captain of England. In these last couple of years, you watch England play and it\u2019s crystal clear. He\u2019s got an authority and aura about him now, his captaincy has gone from strength to strength and you can\u2019t argue with it. Cook\u2019s record for England is fantastic.\u201d Another former England captain Michael Vaughan was among thsoe to pay tribute to Cook on Twitter. \u201c10,000 Runs and still counting ... Unbelievable achievement from the England Skipper ... Cook,\u201d he wrote. BBC broadcaster and former professional cricketer Jonathan Agnew added: \u201cClear Cook would be a special Test player from the start. Flew round the world from Windies to Nagpur 2 days before debut: scored 60 and 104\u201d Even prime minister David Cameron got in on the act, describing Cook\u2019s feat as \u201can incredible achievement.\u201d    Congratulations to Alastair Cook on becoming the first Englishman to score 10000 test runs. It's an incredible achievement.\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) May 30, 2016",
