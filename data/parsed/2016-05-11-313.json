  "body": "I suspect that in the UK Baudelaire is more nodded to respectfully than actually read. This is a pity, because he could be\u00a0said to have been the first modern poet: TS Eliot thought so, saying he\u00a0was \u201cthe greatest exemplar in modern poetry in any language\u201d. It is as much a matter of his state of mind as anything else. Baudelaire was given to reverie and despair in more or less equal parts or, as he put it, \u201cSpleen et Id\u00e9al\u201d. He was very conscious of the way his mind was elsewhere, unsuited to quotidian existence. The idea of the\u00a0poet who is scornful or terrified of\u00a0everyday life pretty much begins with him. This famous sequence was first published in\u00a0France in 1857, and was swiftly condemned by the authorities as an offence against public morality, which did the poet\u2019s reputation no harm at all. In the second poem, he compares the Poet \u2013 that is, himself \u2013 to an albatross, captured by mocking sailors and removed from his natural element: \u201cexiled on earth, amid the jeering crowd, / With giant wings that will not let him walk\u201d. That\u2019s the translation given here, by Anthony Mortimer; and now you have much less excuse not to read Baudelaire than before, for this translation not only makes one of the best stabs yet at making him accessible to the monolingual English speaker, but comes with the original on the facing pages, so that even if all you have is school French, you can get some idea of what the poetry is really like. Translating Baudelaire is probably about as difficult as it gets. Not only do you have to keep as closely as is practical to the original verse forms \u2013 and Baudelaire was a master of these, toying with the classical structures of French verse, making it somehow both precise and fluid at the same time \u2013 you have to try to bring out his gift for nuance in the vocabulary. \u201cJ\u2019ai longtemps habit\u00e9 sous de vastes portiques / Que les soleils marins teignaient de milles feux\u201d is rendered here as \u201cI used to dwell beneath vast porticoes / That sea-born suns tinged with a thousand flames\u201d. You can\u2019t help feeling in the first line that \u201cj\u2019ai longtemps habit\u00e9\u201d has something more mysterious about it than \u201cI used to live\u201d, which is a\u00a0bit too precise and doesn\u2019t carry the suggestion of deep time that the French does (he gets round this, just, with the archaism \u201cdwell\u201d). But it doesn\u2019t matter: you now have the French to check it against, and you\u2019ll need to do so if you can, for Baudelaire\u2019s poetry is, in a sense, what the French language was made for. The structure and flow of the English language make it hard, if not impossible, to capture the essence of his genius. Eliot may have venerated him as a poet, but he knew better than to try to emulate his style, turning instead to the more formally inclined and ironic Jules Laforgue. And poetry in English can carry the burdens of its past in ways that are unavoidable and a bit unwelcome; it\u2019s hard not to sound like someone else. It\u2019s difficult not to notice the almost Kiplingesque rhythms of Mortimer\u2019s translation of \u201cLe Vampire\u201d (\u201cYou came like the blade of a dagger / To my heart that was humbled and sad\u201d), whereas Baudelaire\u2019s words slink like a cat through the verses (\u201cToi qui, comme un coup de couteau, / Dans mon coeur plaintif es entr\u00e9e\u201d). Then there\u2019s the shades of Thomas Gray in \u201cMany a flower casts away / Its sweetly secret fragrance on / The wastes of deepest solitude\u201d in poem 11, \u201cLe Guignon\u201d or \u201cThe Jinx\u201d. I\u2019m not doing this to nitpick; rather to prepare you for Baudelaire by illustrating the difficulties of translating him. You also get a useful essay about his life, helpful notes and a few other poems. This is, I think, the best way yet for us to enter the poet\u2019s dream-like world, producing, as his title says, beauty from the sordid world around him. \u2022 To order The Flowers of Evil for \u00a37.99 (RRP \u00a39.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
