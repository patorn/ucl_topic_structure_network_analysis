  "body": "Roy Carroll, the Northern Ireland goalkeeper, has said Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s team will enter the European Championships \u201con a high\u201d should they extend their historic unbeaten run over the next two matches. Northern Ireland host Belarus at Windsor Park on Friday before playing their final friendly before Euro 2016 against Slovakia in Trnava next Saturday. The Belarus friendly represents O\u2019Neill\u2019s last chance to evaluate fringe players before announcing his squad for France in Belfast on Saturday, but Carroll insists extending the 10-game unbeaten run will be a priority at Windsor.   Related: Martin O\u2019Neill will take Republic of Ireland selection right to the wire    The former Manchester United and West Ham goalkeeper played an influential role when O\u2019Neill\u2019s team created a Northern Ireland record in their last friendly outing against Slovenia. The 38-year-old, who this week signed a one-year contract with Linfield, saved a penalty on his return to the side to ensure Conor Washington\u2019s debut goal secured a milestone victory. And Carroll, pushing Michael McGovern for a starting role at Euro 2016 believes the unbeaten run could have an impact in France should it continue against Belarus and Slovakia. \u201cWe\u2019re on a high having finished top of the group,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to go there and win games and move on. We don\u2019t just want to be there. We\u2019ve got two friendly games and we don\u2019t want to lose either of them because the aim is to go to France on a high.\u201d Carroll\u2019s view is supported by the captain Steven Davis, who insists the transformation between Northern Ireland\u2019s struggle in their last World Cup qualifying campaign and success in reaching their first European Championship by winning their group demonstrates the importance of momentum. \u201cIt makes things a lot easier if you\u2019re getting positive results,\u201d said the Southampton midfielder. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible turnaround for everyone. This campaign has been so enjoyable and it has been a real pleasure to captain this side. \u201cUltimately, the campaign before wasn\u2019t that bad in terms of performances. Maybe we needed a bit better game-management. This time, everyone\u2019s bought into what Michael is doing and getting results has bred confidence. The first game against Hungary played a massive part. To come back and win 2-1 after being a goal down had a massive effect on everyone and the qualifying campaign snowballed from there.\u201d Northern Ireland open their Euro campaign against Poland in Nice on 12 June and Davis is confident O\u2019Neill\u2019s side can qualify from a group that also includes Ukraine and the world champions Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go there and believe that we can get out of the group, and we do believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know Germany is going to be a massive ask. Poland and Ukraine are more realistic targets for us. They\u2019re the ones that we\u2019ve probably got our best chance of taking points from. There is no doubt that there will be upsets.\u201d Northern Ireland (probable 3-5-2): McGovern; Cathcart, McAuley, J. Evans; McLaughlin, Davis, McNair, Norwood, Dallas; K Lafferty, Ward.",
