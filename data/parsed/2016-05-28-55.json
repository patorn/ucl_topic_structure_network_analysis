  "body": "The Republican party battlefield is strewn with Donald Trump\u2019s former competitors and critics, many of whom have risen only to rally to his side.    Related: 'Racists!' 'Illegals!' 'Scum!': Protesters v Donald Trump supporters    But Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s last nominee for president, has refused to capitulate, speaking forcibly against the billionaire even as he marched to the Republican nomination. On Saturday, in a possible allusion to Winston Churchill \u2013 or at least to William Manchester\u2019s three-volume biography of the wartime British prime minister, an influential work among US conservatives \u2013 the Wall Street Journal quoted an anonymous Romney confidant as saying: \u201cHe feels like the last lion.\u201d In an extensive interview with the Journal, conducted at his San Diego home, Romney said he never had any intention of mounting a white knight candidacy against Trump, as has been reported.  His motivation for confronting Trump so publicly, he said \u2013 despite warnings from his closest friends and advisers \u2013 was to set an example for his grandchildren.  \u201cI wanted my grandkids to see that I simply couldn\u2019t ignore what Mr Trump was saying and doing, which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world,\u201d Romney said.     What Mr Trump was saying and doing \u2026 revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world  Mitt Romney     Romney told the Journal he was not initially worried about Trump\u2019s prospects, believing the 17-strong Republican primary field was \u201ccapable\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d enough to fend off his populist appeal.  The former Massachusetts governor, like many Republicans, expected the Trump campaign to implode last summer, after he insulted Mexicans and said Arizona senator and 2008 Republican nominee John McCain was not a \u201cwar hero\u201d because \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d This year, days after Trump did not immediately disavow an expression of support from David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, Romney said one of his sons was driving him to an airport when he asked: \u201cWhen the grandkids ask \u2018What did you do to stop Donald Trump?\u2019 what are you going to say?\u2019\u201d            Romney launches extensive attack on Trump: \u2018A genius he is not\u2019    That, Romney said, was the final push. Defying advisers who warned against going to war with Trump, Romney started drafting a speech on the plane.  In March, in a speech to a Republican National Committee meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, Romney launched a blistering assault, calling Trump a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m no Ronald Reagan,\u201d he said then, \u201cand this is a different moment in time, but I believe with all my heart and soul that we face another time of choosing \u2013 one that will have profound consequences for the Republican party and, more importantly, for our country.\u201d Pundits wondered what impact the speech would have, and whether it was too late. In the end, it may have helped Ted Cruz win Utah, but it did little to slow Trump\u2019s progress to the nomination, which he sealed mathematically this week. And Romney became a constant target of Trump\u2019s.

I became his next target, and the incoming attacks have been constant and brutal.\u201d  Asked by the Journal about Romney, Trump stayed true to form, saying: \u201cOnce a choker, always a choker. I\u2019ve got a store worth more than he is.\u201d      Trump calls Romney a \u2018choker\u2019 during a rally with supporters in Anaheim, California. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters    Trump also dismissed Romney\u2019s assertion that he was speaking out of concern for the future of the country.  \u201cIt has to do with me. I\u2019m the one who forced him out\u201d of running in 2016, Trump said. Romney acknowledged that some Republicans believe his unrelenting disdain for Trump is only helping the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.  \u201cOthers, including myself, believe our first priority should be to stand by our principles \u2013 and if those are in conflict with the nominee, the principles come first,\u201d he said.",
