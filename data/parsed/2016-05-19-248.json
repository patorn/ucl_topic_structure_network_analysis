  "body": "Jeremy Hunt has been accused of prolonging the junior doctors\u2019 dispute unnecessarily for three months after it could have been settled by putting personal \u201cpride\u201d before a resolution.  Labour\u2019s Heidi Alexander claimed in the Commons that the health secretary had missed an opportunity to settle the bitter row by displaying a damaging \u201ccomputer says no\u201d attitude to talks.  Hunt and Alexander, the shadow health secretary, traded verbal blows during a House of Commons debate on Thursday on the new deal announced on Wednesday, which both Hunt and the British Medical Association (BMA) hope will end the nine-month dispute.

So I have to ask you, why couldn\u2019t this deal have been struck in February? Why did you allow your pride back then to come before sensible compromise and constructive talks?\u201d Alexander said.  \u201cWhen you stand up you might try to blame the BMA for the negotiations breaking down, but you failed to say what options you were prepared to consider in order to ensure that the junior doctors who work the most unsociable hours are fairly rewarded. It was a \u2018computer says no\u2019 attitude and that\u2019s no way to run the NHS.\u201d  Alexander said Hunt had ignored her suggestion, made on 7 February, that he make further concessions on the key issue of what hours junior doctor should be expected to work on Saturdays and their pay for doing so as a way of reaching a negotiated settlement.    Related: Junior doctors' contract deal: what was agreed    Seven of the eight days of strikes by junior doctors in England happened after that, which between them involved the cancellation of more than 30,000 planned operations and more than 100,000 outpatient appointments. Four days after Alexander\u2019s letter, Hunt told MPs that talks had failed because of the BMA\u2019s refusal to discuss Saturday working and that he was imposing the contract that had prompted so much anger among junior doctors.  \u201cWhy did he then insist upon trying to bulldoze an imposed contract through when virtually everyone told him not to and the consequences of doing so were obvious for all to see \u2013 protracted industrial action, destroyed morale and a complete breakdown in trust?\u201d she said.  But Hunt rejected her claims. He said the BMA had spent \u201cyears\u201d refusing to discuss Saturday becoming part of a junior doctor\u2019s normal working week, though he praised it for \u201cbravely\u201d changing its stance during the negotiations that led to Wednesday\u2019s potential settlement.  And he criticised Alexander for refusing to say categorically if she supported the new agreement, and insisted he had shown leadership by facing down the BMA.

But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can go through what we have been through for the last 10 months and say that everyone hasn\u2019t got lessons to learn, including the health secretary. \u201cI don\u2019t say I was responsible for the industrial action because I think that was a decision taken by the BMA and initially caused by the fact that at the time there was not willingness to engage with the big issues that we needed to resolve to deliver a seven-day NHS. \u201cWhat I do say is we have come to appreciate that there was a lot of anger, a lot of frustration felt by junior doctors about things that extended well beyond their contract.\u201d",
