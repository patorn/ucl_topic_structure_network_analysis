  "body": "In Dietland fat is, as ever, a feminist issue. Plum Kettle has been battling with her weight for years, suffering the joyless regimes of the big weight-loss companies to no avail. Plum\u2019s real name is Alicia, and she identifies Alicia as the beautiful, slim woman trapped inside plump Plum. Perhaps the gastric-band surgery Plum\u2019s saving for will finally release Alicia? While Plum\u2019s life is routine and grey, limited by the world\u2019s scorn for the overweight, elsewhere in the US a terrorist cell known as \u201cJennifer\u201d starts to take murderous revenge on men who have abused women. By means of violent threats Jennifer also starts to\u00a0enforce drastic changes to the way women are portrayed in the media. Plum\u2019s job answering agony letters for a teenage magazine underscores the book\u2019s lineage back to The Bell Jar, while the chapter headings point up links to the looking-glass world of Alice in Wonderland. The writing style is muted but the momentum of Plum\u2019s \u201crescue\u201d and Jennifer\u2019s reign of terror sweeps the narrative along and the reader with it. A book with a message, loud and clear. \u2022 To order Dietland for \u00a37.19 (RRP \u00a38.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&p over \u00a310, online orders only.
