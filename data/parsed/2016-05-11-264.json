Reduced drag has a big effect, too, of course, allowing you to ride faster for the same effort. Knowing a few basic techniques and etiquette tips will keep you safer, and make you a welcome member of the peloton.   Related: Cycling: how to fix a puncture (even if you don\u2019t have the right tools)    1. The first time It can be daunting riding close to other riders in a group for the first time \u2013 whether that\u2019s on a club ride or maybe a cycle sportive \u2013 so ride at the back to begin with and watch how more experienced riders behave. The basic trick is to ride consistently and predictably. Don\u2019t make the mistake of assuming everyone around you is super-experienced and knows what they\u2019re doing \u2013 watch out for other inexperienced riders and give them a bit more space on the road. 2. Easy on the brakes Always ride with your hands near the brakes in case they\u2019re needed (ie on the hoods or drops, not near the stem) but remember that sudden braking is a last resort if riding in a bunch. Even if the person following your wheel manages to avoid trouble, the chain reaction can mean problems for riders further back. 3. Play it straight The same goes for sudden side-to-side movements. Don\u2019t weave around; instead try to keep as smooth a line as possible. If you want to move to the side, check for space first, and indicate what you\u2019re going to do with a simple hand gesture or call (\u201cOn your left/right\u201d). Similarly, if it looks as if someone is about to move across your line, then just let them know you\u2019re there.  4. Ride to the side Riding with your front wheel behind \u2013 but a few inches off to the side \u2013 of the rear wheel you\u2019re following gives you more room for error. Make sure you stay behind though, as crossing wheels is a recipe for disaster. 5. Heads up Don\u2019t just follow wheel in front \u2013 try to look ahead so you can see what\u2019s coming up. Groups are fluid and their shapes constantly shifting, so keep an eye on how the bunch is moving.         Video: Riding inside the peloton with Shimano TV.    6. Out of the saddle If you stand up to pedal harder when you hit a climb, your bike slows and shifts back. Make a harder effort to keep the effect to a minimum, or let the person behind know what you\u2019re doing.   Related: Cycling: how to conquer hills    7. Know your signals and shouts Riders at the front use hand signals and shouts to warn those behind of hazards such as potholes, parked cars, upcoming junctions or approaching vehicles on narrow roads. These vary from region to region, but be clear and you can\u2019t go far wrong. Common calls and gestures include: Potholes. Shout \u201cHole!\u201d \u2013 or point. Parked cars. Call out \u201cleft\u201d or \u201con the left\u201d when the whole group has to move out. Alternatively, swing your left hand behind your back and point to the right, where you\u2019re going. Approaching cars. Calls seem to vary \u2013 \u201ccar up\u201d, \u201ccar down\u201d, \u201ccar back\u201d \u2013 but I like to keep it simple and shout: \u201ccar!\u201d Junction or difficult corner. \u201cSlowing\u201d \u2013 or move your hand palm down as if patting an imaginary dog. In short, ride smoothly, go with the flow \u2013 and a bit of politeness goes a long way.  What\u2019s your experience of riding in a big group? What shouts and signals do you use?
