  "body": "SOLVING NWTSL UITDN All the best managers crave a real challenge. Pep Guardiola, for instance, is right now grappling with the question of how to spend money faster than Richard Pryor in Brewster\u2019s Millions as he plots the overhaul of Manchester City; and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has not yet been unveiled as Manchester United\u2019s manager because he is still working hard to develop exactly the right blend of smugness and contrition to display when he is presented as the ideal man to restore glory to Old Trafford less than six months after presiding over an almighty whiffing collapse at Stamford Bridge. It\u2019ll be 100% smugness, is The Fiver\u2019s guess, once Jorge Mendes has negotiated the expunging from all conversation of any mention of Chelsea\u2019s disgraceful title defence.   Related: Rafael Ben\u00edtez agrees to stay as Newcastle manager on three-year deal    Meanwhile in the north-east of England, another Big Cup-winning manager has agreed to embark on a truly remarkable expedition: Rafa Ben\u00edtez has signed a three-year deal during which he will attempt to lead Newcastle United from the Championship to glory, or at least respectability. The exact details of the contract have not been disclosed but it is believed to include permission for the Spaniard to administer a potent enema to a squad very much in need of cleansing. Ben\u00edtez will have to build from the bottom up while ensuring that the massive kahuna at the top is not able to exert any influence beyond belching his approval for whatever transfer funds are required. It\u2019s quite a stunt that Ben\u00edtez has agreed to attempt but the potential reward goes beyond trophies. The paradox of Ben\u00edtez is that he is a manager whose manner inspires little affection from players but who thrives on love from fans. He may \u2013 we can\u2019t know for sure \u2013 have enjoyed mentally flipping two fingers at Chelsea fans after delivering them the 2013 Big Vase in the face of unremitting scorn but mostly he\u2019s all about brotherhood. He has obviously been moved by the support of Newcastle fans, 28,000 of whom signed a petition for him to stay despite last season\u2019s relegation because they were impressed by the way he made some kind of sense out of Steve McClaren\u2019s NWTSL UITDN despite it being an anagram that was missing a few key letters.  QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe were caught in a moment and there is nothing to justify. We should have known better and we have to take stick for that\u201d \u2013 Botswana captain Joel Mogorosi apologises after the national team were photographed piling into a local supermarket to stock up on booze, while wearing team tracksuits, following the 2-1 friendly win over Lesotho. FOOTBALL WEEKLY LIVE AC Jimbo and co are heading back to Manchester, on Friday September 2. Get your tickets while they\u2019re mildly toasty NOW!     Branded and everything. Photograph: The Guardian    FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: Gary Walsh (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Presumably if Noble Francis married Mark Noble he\u2019d be called Noble Francis-Noble. So then everyone he said it to would assume his name is Francis Noble and he\u2019s doing that Bond thing. I can\u2019t say whether this reversal in name would correspond to a reversal in letter-publishing success, but I suspect Gary would be both shaken and stirred\u201d \u2013 Gary Mantle. \u201cIf he kept his \u2018maiden\u2019 name, double-barrelled it with that of the Hammers dynamo, got divorced but kept the name, married Cherries full-back Simon Francis and then added this to a classy triple-barrelled name (Noble Francis-Noble-Francis, for those who have lost the will to live), I am sure that he would have even more letters published, as The Fiver\u2019s daily word target becomes slightly more attainable without having to worry about actually writing anything\u201d \u2013 Lochlan MacDonald.  \u201cBizarrely, I\u2019m quite enjoying reading The Fiver section of the new tea-time daily letter by Noble Francis\u201d \u2013 Martyn Shapter. \u201cOne of the 1,057 things more irritating than the constant presence of Noble Francis in the letters section are the presence of letters bemoaning the constant presence of Noble Francis. Having been on the receiving end of similar ire on a different website, I feel compelled to point out that if these people\u2019s contributions were greater in quality and quantity, there would be less of a need to publish everything Noble sends in. I also imagine the bar is set lower for The Fiver than it is for the Football365 mailbox, so readers have even less to complain about\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor.  \u201cWhatever happened to Paul Jurdeczka?\u201d \u2013 Chad Thomas. \u201cIn response to Matt Keen\u2019s response to my letter (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), I\u2019d like to say two things. One, he\u2019s obviously never visited Woodstock, NY where I work. All the rebooting of the router in the world isn\u2019t going to speed up the internet connection here, we\u2019re still largely stuck in the 70s before the internet was even born. Two, the fact that I\u2019m bothering to respond to his response to my letter in The Fiver is a clear indication that time is clearly not precious to me\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Adams. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Lochlan MacDonald. JOIN GUARDIAN SOULMATES Chances are that if you\u2019re reading this tea-timely football email, you\u2019re almost certainly single.

BITS AND BOBS Arsenal have signed Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Granit Xhaka for around \u00a325m, presumably because he is good on the counter. \u201cWhen I was younger, even though I had a big brother, my parents would give me the house key every day. It\u2019s in my head that I am a leader,\u201d he roared.     Stop staring. Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images    Meanwhile, book the parade! Swiss Sergio Ramos says winning Big Cup is like making the beast with two backs. \u201cThe first time is like when you make love: you always remember it,\u201d he purred. Leicester City suits are winking suggestively at striker Ahmed Musa, but CSKA Moscow boss Leonid Slutsky isn\u2019t having any of it. \u201cThe British club offered a bit less than \u20ac30m,\u201d he sniffed. Sevilla\u2019s president doesn\u2019t want Unai Emery leaving the Big Vase addicts. \u201cHe is crazy about football, the hours he puts in, how he manages the squad,\u201d trilled Jos\u00e9 Castro. \u201cI can tell you he has said he is not on the market, and is not thinking about anything else.\u201d The importance of punctuation in stories about Norwich City\u2019s chairman dept: \u201cBalls: we will keep our best players at club\u201d can so easily become \u201cballs we will keep our best players at club\u201d. And after appointing Pako Ayestar\u00e1n, Valencia suits have driven coach Phil Neville to the Parque Natural de la Sierra Calderona and dumped him by the roadside, speeding off with nary a second glance in the mirrors. \u201cIn football new managers come in, they want to bring their own staff,\u201d he tootled. \u201cIt\u2019s football. Hopefully in the future when I am a manager, I will want to bring my own staff with me.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? It\u2019s the Bandinis 2016! Paolo hands out the gongs at the end of another Serie A season. Which team were eventually relegated after they, very literally, failed to turn up against Blackeye Rovers. This and more in this week\u2019s Knowledge. Marina Hyde recasts Manchester as Verona, and Pep and Jos\u00e9 as Capulets and Montagues, then sticks it to both of them. Laurie Bell was one of the most expensive 12-year-olds ever when he joined Manchester City, but it took a decade and a 4,000-mile journey from Manchester before he could make his professional debut. He tells his story. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. ALL ANYONE WANTS",
