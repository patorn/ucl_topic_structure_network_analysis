  "body": "Despite Bernie Sanders\u2019 surprise victory in Indiana, the Democratic race is fundamentally unchanged \u2013 Hillary Clinton looks near-certain to be the nominee. To reverse his fortunes, Sanders has to prove the polls wrong. A lot wrong.   Related: Bernie Sanders pulls off shock victory over Hillary Clinton in Indiana    To pick up the 973 pledged delegates he needs to cross the finish line, Sanders will need to win every remaining Democratic primary. Polling however suggests he might not win any.  The Vermont senator needs to capture about two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates. No numbers are available for the primaries that will be held in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Oregon and Kentucky, partly because pollsters know the voters there won\u2019t change the political calculus much \u2013 they\u2019re not \u201cwasting\u201d their time in places with few delegates available. But where opinion polls are available, they show Sanders trailing Clinton in New Jersey and, crucially, California.

Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP    Just as for Republicans, California will be decisive in the Democratic race since it offers 546 delegates. Sanders will need to win the majority to have a chance of securing the nomination but he has an approximately nine percentage point gap to close on Clinton. And in New Jersey, he will have to erase Clinton\u2019s 16 percentage point lead, then overtake her by at least 16 percentage points (and all that in a month: the state votes on 7 June).  Sanders finished Tuesday night with 52.5% of the vote and 43 delegates. However, Democratic primaries are not winner-takes-all and so Clinton\u2019s vote share in Indiana translated into 37 delegates. In terms of net differences, the only ones that matter in primary races, Sanders only won six extra delegates \u2013 and that simply isn\u2019t enough given that Clinton is ahead by 321 pledged delegates and by 481 superdelegates. Despite this, it seems unlikely that Sanders will drop out of the Democratic race until he has no choice. And there seems to be party consensus that this is a good thing; a poll released this week by NBC News and Survey Monkey found that 57% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want Sanders to stay in the race until the convention.",
