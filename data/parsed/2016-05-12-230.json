Uganda is to use Tanga, a seaport city about 200km north of Dar es Salaam, to export its crude oil, rather than Lamu in Kenya. The announcement was made last month at the East African Community (EAC) summit held just outside Uganda\u2019s capital, Kampala.  Uganda said a pipeline between Kabaale, in Hoima district, and Tanga, of about 1,400km, will be the most cost-effective route when Uganda begins exporting oil by 2020.   Map showing pipeline route and locations of Lokichar and Lamu   Having had a pipeline route through Kenya rejected by Uganda, Kenya plans to build a pipeline from Lokichar in its oil-rich Turkana region to Lamu, where it is building a port, close to the border with Somalia.  \u201cPresident Yoweri Museveni [of Uganda] and I have announced that Kenya will embark on the construction of the Lamu-Lokichar pipeline while Uganda will build the other pipeline through its southern borders,\u201d wrote Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, on Facebook.   \u201cWe have, however, agreed to continue cooperating on petroleum issues since both countries are new in the industry.\u201d     In March, Museveni and Kenyatta asked experts from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to assess both routes and, in a report last month, Ugandan experts recommended the Tanga plan.  \u201cThe Kabaale-Tanga route is the only option to secure first oil export by mid-2020, with pipeline availability of 99%,\u201d the report said.

It is hard to clear land in Kenya \u2013 taking about two years to compensate land owners. In Tanzania, the government owns all the land, making it easier to access.  Security was also an issue. As Lamu is closer to Somalia on the Indian Ocean, there are fears that a pipeline could be a target for al-Shabaab militants. Tanga port is already operational, while Lamu would only become available in 2022. The project is envisaged to create 15,000 jobs in Uganda and Tanzania. Isaac Shinyekwa, a research fellow on regional integration at the Kampala-based Economic Policy Research Centre, said: \u201cLandlocked Uganda wanted to have an alternative port to rely on in case there were issues in Kenya.\u201d   Uganda\u2019s decision not to partner Kenya is a major blow to the region\u2019s biggest economy and could strain relations in the bloc.   Some top officials in Kenya have accused Uganda and Tanzania of locking the country out of talks.   Kenya has recoverable oil reserves of up to 750m barrels, dwarfed by Uganda\u2019s recoverable reserves of 1.8bn-2.2bn barrels (pdf).

Uganda exported goods worth $427m (\u00a3294m) last year, but imported goods worth $610m (\u00a3421) from Kenya, according to the Bank of Uganda. In the same year, Tanzania exported goods worth $79m to Uganda.  Kenyan media report that Nairobi could begin talks with South Sudan about a possible partnership on the northern route.   France\u2019s Total, a major player in Uganda\u2019s oil sector and widely seen as having influenced the choice of route, says it has already secured the $4bn needed to fund the Hoima-Tanga route.  Kenya says the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank have shown interest in funding its pipeline.       Kampala relies on Mombasa port for almost all her imports. During the post-election violence in 2008, Uganda was cut off, paralysing businesses.

You only need to prepare for it,\u201d Karuhanga said.  EAC members are partnering to develop other projects, including a refinery in Uganda and a standard gauge railway. Kenya and Tanzania will buy stakes in the refinery as part of a commitment among member states to facilitate financing of projects that benefit the bloc.   Kenya has said it will take a 2.5% share in the refinery, while Tanzania will take 8%. The facility is expected to process 60,000 barrels of oil per day when Ugandan production begins in 2018.",
