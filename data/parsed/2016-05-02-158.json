Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Desnard says his managerial job at the perfume company, which made him redundant 18 months ago, was so tedious he became exhausted and literally bored out of his mind.  The 44-year-old said his \u201cdescent into hell\u201d was similar to a burnout, but less interesting.   In what is believed to be the first case of its kind in France, Desnard is seeking \u20ac360,000 (\u00a3282,000) in compensation and damages \u2013 including holiday pay, he says, is due.  French press reporting his claims have taken the unusual step of using the English term \u201cbore out\u201d to describe what Desnard, who lives in Paris, claims to have suffered.  Desnard complained that between 2010 and 2014 he was mis au placard, or put in the cupboard by his then employer Interparfums, a French phrase that involves giving employees little or no work, or menial tasks.  He told Agence France-Presse he was relegated to doing tasks that had nothing to do with his job and deprived of his original responsibilities. This, he alleges, left him \u201cdestroyed\u201d and with \u201cserious depression\u201d.  \u201cI was ashamed of being paid for doing nothing,\u201d he said.  Desnard claimed the stress and lack of stimulation at work triggered an epileptic fit when he was driving.  He was signed off work for seven months before being made redundant in September 2014 for \u201cprolonged absence\u201d that had \u201cdisturbed the smooth working\u201d of the company.  Jean-Philippe Benissan, Interparfums\u2019 lawyer, remarked that Desnard \u201cnever said anything about being bored\u201d during his time with the firm and alleged he had first complained of burnout.  \u201cIf he had nothing to do for four years, why did the company keep him on,\u201d Benissan asked.  In December 2015, a court ordered Desnard to pay his former employer \u20ac1,000 for defamation. The court judged he was \u201cinspired by a sense of personal animosity\u201d against his former employer who he had become convinced, without any real proof, had \u201cruined his health\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2016 to correct the phrase \u201cmis au placard\u201d.",
