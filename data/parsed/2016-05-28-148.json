  "body": "Hay festivalDates: now until 5 June The Glastonbury of literary festivals, Hay combines serious star power with a certain boho edge. It was founded in 1988 by Peter Florence, who is still a\u00a0director, and his parents, who previously worked in theatre in the town of\u00a0Hay-on-Wye, Powys, famed for its second hand bookshops. According to legend, the Florences funded the first festival \u2013 playwright Christopher Fry was among the writers present \u2013 with the \u00a3100 winnings from a poker game. The following year, Arthur Miller was persuaded to attend as the star guest. With a turnover of \u00a39-10m, it is now a\u00a0global franchise: Hay has offshoots in\u00a0Peru, Colombia, Spain and\u00a0Mexico. Key quotes: \u201cHay on Wye: is it some kind of sandwich?\u201d Arthur Miller What to wear: Wellies and a Penguin Classics tote bag Top guests in 2016: Sam Mendes, Yanis\u00a0Varoufakis, Caitlin Moran Port Eliot festivalDates: 28-31 July Held in the picturesque grounds of the ancient Port Eliot estate in south-east Cornwall since 2003, it is the closest literary festivals come to genuine hipness, combining readings and talks with music from Andrew Weatherall and Sidestepper, a stage curated by the hipster nature-writing website Caught by the River, and a wealth of \u201cwellbeing activities\u201d including foraging walks, stargazing, Tibetan chanting and meditation. It is hosted by the lord\u00a0and lady of the manor, Peregrine and Cathy St\u00a0Germans, and their pet whippet, Roo, whose presence adds to\u00a0the general air of well-heeled bohemianism. What to wear: A floral maxi-dress / plaid shirt and an artfully battered straw hat Top guests in 2016: Ali Smith, Dave\u00a0Eggers, Max Porter Oxford literary festivalDates: took place in April. The 2017 festival runs from 25 March to 2 April What the Oxford literary festival lacks in rock\u2019n\u2019roll spirit it makes up for in elegance and intellectual heft. Held in the splendid surroundings of Christ Church, with its Tudor cloisters and hall, this is a congregation of political and cultural heavyweights. Speakers appearing during this, its 20th year, included Richard Dawkins, Alan Ayckbourn and Kazuo Ishiguro. It\u00a0is also at the centre of the writers\u2019 fees controversy: the festival recently hit the headlines after Philip Pullman resigned as patron over its failure to pay authors. Key quotes: \u201cThe Oxford literary festival is intellectual Viagra.\u201d Lucy Worsley, historian and broadcaster What to wear: Leather elbow patches, a\u00a0mop of untended grey hair Cheltenham literature festivalDates: 7-16 October Cheltenham, which started in 1949, is\u00a0the original British literary festival, and one of the oldest in the world. It\u00a0was started by the town hall manager George Wilkinson, who branched out into events by organising a music festival just three weeks after the end of the second world war. He followed with a literary festival, and approached local author John Moore to help. At the\u00a0first one, the poet Cecil Day-Lewis, who taught at Cheltenham College, read a selection of contemporary verse. Last year\u2019s speakers included the rapper George the Poet \u2013 who was a\u00a0guest director \u2013 Boris Becker, Julian\u00a0Barnes and Anne Enright. What to wear: A twinset and pearls Aldeburgh literary festivalDates: took place in March. Dates for 2017 tbc The Suffolk town of Aldeburgh punches above its weight in cultural terms: it was the home of the composer Benjamin Britten, who founded the Snape Maltings concert hall, which hosts the international Aldeburgh festival of arts. The town also has an annual poetry festival and several food festivals. Aldeburgh literary festival was started in 2002 by John and Mary James of the Aldeburgh Bookshop. Despite its small scale, it has attracted an array of top speakers, including Michael Frayn, Doris Lessing and Harold Pinter. The 2016 lineup included Jonathan Dimbleby and Edmund de Waal. Key quotes: \u201cAldeburgh must be to literature what Glyndebourne, in its early days, was to opera.\u201d Charles Moore, the Telegraph What to wear: A Boden fisherman-style jumper and yellow sou\u2019wester Harrogate crime writing festivalDates: 21-24 July Harrogate, now in its 14th year, is\u00a0distinctive in its focus on genre. Held\u00a0in the Old Swan hotel, where Agatha Christie stayed under an alias during a\u00a0brief and mysterious disappearance, it attracts 13,500 crime fans. Last year\u2019s special guest was Jo\u00a0Nesb\u00f8, the current star of Scandi crime, other top draws have included Ian Rankin in\u00a02012 and, in 2013, Jeanette Winterson interviewing Ruth\u00a0Rendell. It hosts the Theakstons Old Peculier prize for crime novel\u00a0of the year, which this year\u00a0pits debut novels\u00a0against veterans including Val\u00a0McDermid and\u00a0JK Rowling (writing as\u00a0Robert Galbraith). This year\u2019s programming chair is Peter James, \u201cking of the police procedural\u201d. Top guests in 2016: Linwood Barclay and Martina Cole What to wear: Trench coat, trilby, false\u00a0moustache Edinburgh international book festivalDates: 13-29 August   Spanning nearly three weeks and eight\u00a0theatres, with more than 800 authors taking part, Edinburgh is the largest literary festival in the world. As\u00a0if that weren\u2019t enough for culture lovers, it\u00a0coincides with the international festival and the fringe. The\u00a0only problem may be deciding between\u00a0the hundreds \u2013 thousands? \u2013 of events on\u00a0offer. Past speakers have included Jesse Jackson, Zadie Smith, Susan Sontag, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Neil Gaiman, Toni Morrison and Al\u00a0Gore. What to wear: A warm jumper",
