  "body": "Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Buscemi, Michael Palin, Timothy Dalton, Olga Kurylenko, Toby Kebbel, Simon Russell Beale, Paddy Considine and Andrea Riseborough will all join the cast of Armando Iannucci\u2019s political satire The Death of Stalin, according to the Hollywood Reporter.   Related: Armando Iannucci: 'What the BBC needs to do is to bite the bullet'    Iannucci\u2019s follow-up to his hit HBO comedy Veep will centre on the aftermath of the Soviet leader\u2019s demise in 1953, which led to a power vacuum and days of political infighting. It is based on Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin\u2019s 2011 graphic novel The Death of Stalin, which was first published in French. Buscemi will play Nikita Khrushchev, Stalin\u2019s eventual successor, with Tambor as Georgy Malenkov, the chairman of the council of ministers in the wake of Stalin\u2019s death. Dalton will play Georgy Zhukov, a war hero and former confidante of Stalin who was another key figure in the power struggle. The Death of Stalin will be Iannucci\u2019s second film, following In the Loop, 2009\u2019s big-screen take on his TV series The Thick of It. The Scottish satirist also executive-produced 2013\u2019s Alan Partridge movie, Alpha Papa. The Death of Stalin was announced as shooting this year.",
