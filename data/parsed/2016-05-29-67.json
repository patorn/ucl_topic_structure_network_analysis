Sanya and Zahra, a pair of friends who have grown their \u201cmodest fashion\u201d business from a small market stall in Bradford over the past six years, were frantically wrapping long tunics and dresses in black tissue paper while advising customers on purchases. Among them was Amara Sadeeq, a London law graduate and full-time mother to three small children, who had chosen a dusty pink abaya. \u201cI usually wear black, but I thought I\u2019d try something a bit different,\u201d she said. \u201cSome members of my family always wear black, and don\u2019t approve of makeup. But I think women need to look beautiful and feel confident.\u201d   Related: Muslim Lifestyle Expo in London highlights largely untapped market    Sadeeq had come to the Saverah Women Expo, at the Intercontinental hotel next to London\u2019s O2 Arena, along with about 5,000 others. The event was to showcase Muslim businesses aimed at women: modest fashion, halal cosmetics, jewellery, greetings cards and chocolates for Ramadan. Muslim charities, banks and solicitors were present, and motivational talks were on the schedule. The expo was also about \u201cempowering Muslim women. We have a voice and a lifestyle, we start businesses, we don\u2019t fit the stereotype,\u201d said Shazia Ramzan, a spokeswoman for Saverah. About 90 businesses were exhibiting at the event, including dozens of international and UK fashion designers. \u201cModest fashion has been a phenomenon elsewhere, especially in the Gulf, for a while, and now it\u2019s becoming more of a statement here,\u201d said Ramzan. The global Muslim clothing market is forecast to be worth $327bn by 2020, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report. International retailers such as Marks and Spencer and Uniqlo have launched ranges aimed at Muslim women.     The catwalk at Saverah Women 2016. Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian    Farheen Rahman, a designer based in Kolkata who trained at the London College of Fashion, had returned to the UK to show her range of modest clothing for the first time. \u201cThis is my debut show. Only in the past year have I been thinking about Islamic clothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI see girls and young women wanting to be fashionable but also wanting to be modest. Until recently they had to compromise on one or the other.\u201d Another factor in the growth of modest fashion was rising disposable incomes among young Muslims, Rahman added. \u201cYou see this very clearly in India, where spending power used to be the preserve of the elite, but now the middle class has risen up.\u201d Twins Ranna and Rasha Ahmed, who launched their label Hijab Star less than a year ago, also pointed to a generational shift. \u201cYoung Muslim women of our generation are much more interested in fashion than our mothers,\u201d said Ranna.     90 businesses exhibited at the event. Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian    On the catwalk, elegant models showed off outfits ranging from skinny trousers paired with close-fitting tunics and minimal hijabs to stunning all-encompassing black abayas with elaborate veils. Watching the show, Nadia Amdanee said: \u201cI\u2019m French and I like to be fashionable, but I also know the limits my religion imposes. Now it\u2019s possible to be really distinctive and stylish while being true to your faith.\u201d Not everyone at the expo was set on modesty. Zahra Pederson, who runs a personal training service called the Healthy Hijab, was gathering signatures in support of a campaign, Faces of Muslimah, to be launched after Ramadan to celebrate diversity among Muslim women. \u201cMy religion is in my heart, not how I look,\u201d she said, wearing an outfit considerably more revealing than most at the show. \u201cIf you look at me, you wouldn\u2019t know I\u2019m a Muslim. But I pray five times a day, and I\u2019ll fast over Ramadan. You can\u2019t judge my actions on what I look like.\u201d",
