  "body": "It is becoming increasingly difficult to criticise Islam and Muslims in western countries such as Australia, the Somali-born author and human rights campaigner Ayaan Hirsi Ali has said, because \u201cwe only see them [Muslims] through this prism of victims and victimisation\u201d. It was \u201cperfectly fine\u201d to question and criticise any religion, including Islam, Ali said on the ABC\u2019s Q&A on Monday night.  The program was criticised on social media for discussing Islam without having a practising Muslim on the panel. The panel was selected as part of the the Sydney writers\u2019 festival and featured international authors.   Related: Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali \u2013 review    There were some questions about philosophy and the arts, but much of the discussion focused on Muslims, Islam and radicalisation. Ali, a former devout Muslim and now outspoken critic of Islam, was responding to an audience member who asked how she felt about her views and books being criticised by liberals. She replied: \u201cI do think that it\u2019s not only important to address the extremists and their agenda, but how the left contributes to that agenda.\u201d    Sigh. Why isn't there a Muslim on the panel? How about talking to Muslims not just about them? Come on. #QandA\u2014 Ruby Hamad (@rubyhamad) May 16, 2016    She said she had Muslim friends who had been subjected to forced marriages and female genital mutilation, and who had been forced to wear a veil. Ali herself was subjected to female genital mutilation as a child. She urged people not to be \u201csqueamish\u201d about criticising those practices. \u201cThis is what is happening to Muslim women,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have young girls who are subjected to forced marriage, it is not a marriage, it\u2019s an arranged rape. It is a forced rape and I wish we were not squeamish about it. We were not squeamish about slavery, we were not squeamish about eradicating apartheid, and I wish that is one thing we would not be squeamish about.\u201d Ali\u2019s latest book, Heretic, argues for the reformation of Islam.    And those are legitimate issues that Ayaan raised which need to be addressed but they are not religious practices. #QandA\u2014 Mariam Veiszadeh (@MariamVeiszadeh) May 16, 2016    The author and co-founder of The Philosophers\u2019 Magazine, Julian Baggini, said Muslims \u201care put in the category of the oppressed, which means you can\u2019t say anything critical of them\u201d.  \u201cI think there are reasons why people like myself, white male westerners, are rightly queasy about going in and aggressively criticising people from other cultures,\u201d he said.  \u201cI have been travelling a bit this year and I go to places like India and speak to Islamic philosophers, and a huge number of them say they\u2019re sick of being told how to live by white western imperialists. So I think some of the reluctance of liberals to be vocal about this is because in the past ... we\u2019ve been too quick to assume our morality is superior and impose it on people.\u201d    Related: Writers' festival cheat sheet: how to bluff your way through the literary season    Emma Sky, an author and teacher of Middle East politics at the Jackson Institute, said it was not her role to criticise Muslims or condemn Islam and that the appropriate people to address extremism within Islam were Muslims. Most of the world\u2019s Muslims did not view members of Islamic State as Muslim, she added.    At this point, I'm annoyed that we are always discussed & not part of the conversation. Wish @RandaAFattah or @YMorsi was on #qanda tonight\u2014 lydia_shelly (@lydia_shelly) May 16, 2016    \u201cDo I look at Ted Cruz or [Donald] Trump and think those are representatives of Christianity?\u201d she said. \u201cDo we want to have people of other faiths condemning Christianity because of the way that those people behave? Yes, there\u2019s lots that needs to happen within Islam and I talk to many Muslim friends about that, but I don\u2019t feel as a western, non-Muslim that my role is to stand up and criticise aspects of their religion.  \u201cI will criticise acts of violence, and the horrible terrorist attacks that took place in France. Those are awful. But I will not say, \u2018that is Islam\u2019.\u201d British rapper, poet and author Kate Tempest responded by saying that terror was being inflicted globally, including at the hands of the British and Australian governments. But it was easier to point to violence as occurring outside our own culture, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult thing to separate these acts of terror because I think that actually, there is so much disastrous terror being inflicted globally,\u201d she said.    Rape, domestic violence occur beyond religion & geographic boundaries #Qanda\u2014 Sara Saleh (@SaraSalehOz) May 16, 2016    \u201cWe can spot barbarity in other cultures and in our past, but when it\u2019s in our midst we find it harder to accept and own up to it. We are in the middle of a barbarous time and greed is at the root of it. It\u2019s interesting we\u2019re talking about these diabolical regimes but there is an equally diabolical regime in power which is the regime of capitalism.\u201d A number of people following the program on Twitter also expressed disappointment that the panellists were not asked about the impact of the Australia Council\u2019s drastic funding cuts, despite the panel being part of the writers\u2019 festival.  The arts sector has been left reeling over the past week, as many organisations found out they had not received funding grants.     #QandA What chance do we have to be a good society when the govt cuts arts funding as if our culture/soul was just a dessert to be skipped?\u2014 Sir Jack Crowther (@kalisana) May 16, 2016      I'm expecting some questions about arts cuts tonight, 65 organisations had funding cuts reported last week #qanda #UJ16\u2014 Lisa Divissi (@lisadivissi) May 16, 2016      What is the panel's opinion on the extreme cuts in the arts in australia? #question #qanda\u2014 Aiden More (@aidenmore) May 16, 2016",
