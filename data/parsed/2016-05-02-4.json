  "body": "Well, you can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t go down fighting. It took until the final half-hour for Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s title challenge finally, definitively to unravel but from the seventh minute, when Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 initiated a snarling squabble with Mikel John Obi, to the seventh minute of stoppage time, when the final whistle blew and players and managers brawled on their way down the tunnel, this was a display full more of malice than of merit. In this astonishing season, now embellished with its 5,000-1 champions, how Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 made it all the way to stoppage time before he was booked might be the greatest miracle of all. In the dying moments of the first half, after Danny Rose slid in late on Willian in front of the Spurs dug-out, players and coaches from both sides came together in a m\u00eal\u00e9e that distracted the officials sufficiently for the Belgian to push his nails into one of Diego Costa\u2019s eyes and down his face and emerge unnoticed and unpunished. Costa is used to winning trophies and being unpleasantly aggressive to others; here it was he who was bullied, and then he helped present a trophy to someone else.

And so it continued. \u00c9rik Lamela, booked early in the first half for a two-footed foul on Cesc F\u00e0bregas, later appeared to tread on the Spaniard\u2019s hand. Of Tottenham\u2019s outfield players, by the end only Toby Alderweireld had not been booked and it would be a surprise if Dele Alli, retrospectively banned from this and Tottenham\u2019s remaining two top-flight fixtures after punching a player in their previous game, did not have company on the sidelines as Spurs\u2019 season peters out \u2013 potentially quite a lot of company. Guus Hiddink spoke afterwards about how these bad-tempered occasions \u201chappen a lot in the Latin world\u201d, alluding perhaps to Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham\u2019s Argentinian manager, who twice entered the pitch to get involved in the bad-tempered action, at one stage had to be separated from Steve Holland, Chelsea\u2019s assistant first-team coach, and was at the centre of the post-match brawl, which began when Hiddink attempted to chaperone F\u00e0bregas past him and down the tunnel (the Dutchman, who speaks Spanish, said later that his player was being threatened in the language). Pochettino has fashioned a young and vibrant team and minutes after the game\u2019s end spoke calmly and genially to the media, but he showed here that the spirit of Antonio Rattin, famously, furiously sent off in a World Cup quarter-final 50 years ago and eight miles away, lives within him. \u201cIt\u2019s football,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are men, they are men and we need to show we are strong.\u201d The irony is that it was supposed to be Chelsea who were motivated by spite. There was little for them to play for but professional pride \u2013 which has not always been evident in their performances this season \u2013 and a refusal to cede the title they won a year ago to local rivals. It proved motivation enough, with Eden Hazard, whose assertion that \u201cwe don\u2019t want Tottenham to win the league, if we can beat them it will be good\u201d, represented the apotheosis of the pre-match trolling, coming off the bench wonderfully to complete their comeback from a two-goal half-time deficit. There was a moment before kick-off, as a giant \u201cPride of London\u201d banner was carried across the Shed End by Chelsea\u2019s fans, when it was tempting to wonder if they would continue passing it around the stadium until it reached the other end. Failing that, perhaps they could be tempted to stuff it into a large bag and hide it in a cupboard for the foreseeable future. There is, after all, a shelf in the club\u2019s trophy cabinet that has just become available. But within this performance Chelsea\u2019s players showed that perhaps they share with their fans a desire to wrest back the status they have so emphatically and humiliatingly lost this season. Of course, there were always three teams in this marriage. As Asmir Begovic prepared to take the free-kick, deep on Chelsea\u2019s left-wing, that followed Walker\u2019s first, early foul on Pedro, a fan in the front row immediately behind him held up a placard that read, \u201cLet\u2019s do it for Ranieri\u201d. But few Chelsea supporters at that stage seemed to be thinking of Leicester, just of their club\u2019s own superiority, temporarily misplaced. \u201cChampions of Europe,\u201d they bellowed repeatedly, \u201cyou\u2019ll never see that.\u201d It is just four years since Chelsea won the Champions League; in the build-up to this game Hiddink described his side\u2019s remaining fixtures \u2013 against Sunderland, Liverpool and Leicester, of which only one now seems at all important in any real sense, and that only to Chelsea\u2019s opponents \u2013 as \u201cmassive games\u201d, an illustration of how far, how fast they have fallen. But then, in the final moments, as the game headed towards its savage and definitive conclusion, the home fans burst into the loudest song of the night: \u201cLeicester, champions!\u201d They are no longer the kings, but they took to the role of kingmakers rather well.",
