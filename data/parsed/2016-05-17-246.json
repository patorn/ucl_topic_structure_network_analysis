But to really grasp how the government is stacking the odds against disabled people applying for benefits, it\u2019s worth turning your eye to what is being done to the benefit appeals system. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been allocated \u00a322m of public money to hire new \u201cpresenting officers\u201d to \u201csupport\u201d it at disability benefit tribunals. Disability campaigners warn that these 180 presenting officers, rather than helping judges to make fair decisions about whether to overturn the DWP\u2019s rejection of someone\u2019s claim for benefits, will inevitably argue as forcibly as possible in the government\u2019s favour.    With no access to free representation \u2013 and unable to pay for it \u2013 people have to go up against the DWP alone    Could their appointment have anything to do with the fact that the proportion of successful appeals against personal independence payment (Pip) assessments has increased with every quarter since the benefit was introduced? Pip claimants won in 60% of cases from July to September 2015, up from 56% in the previous quarter. In\u00a0cases of employment and support allowance, 58% of claimants won on appeal. Contrast the funding for the presenting officers with funding for advisers to help the disabled person going to tribunal. In many areas welfare rights officers have been cut, while legal aid cuts mean that people appealing against their benefit rejection no longer have the right to help (aid is only available for appeals of appeals based on points of law). For an insight into the impact of this, the Law Centres Network says that for the whole of 2015, there were only 254 new benefits cases helped by civil legal aid in England and Wales. This compares with 82,542 cases in 2012-13, the year before the cuts. Meanwhile, alternatives, such as Citizens Advice bureaux (CAB), local mental health charities and disability organisations are left to shoulder an impossible burden with insuffient resources. With no access to free representation \u2013 and unable to pay for it \u2013 people dealing with disabilities, chronic illness, and mental health problems have to go up against the DWP alone. \u201cThe whole system is skewed against us, first, getting the [benefit] we apply for and need and, then, being able to afford the help to appeal,\u201d one woman, who has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome as well as depression and anxiety, said to me. The 29-year-old, like everyone I\u2019ve spoken to who has struggled to appeal against the DWP, didn\u2019t want to be named. She told me that, after scoring zero points in her Pip assessment, she was quoted \u00a3750 by a law firm to represent her at her appeal. Her mental health problems meant she felt too overwhelmed to go alone but nNo local service \u2013 from the CAB to mental health charities \u2013 had the resources to help her. She ended up going to her tribunal with a pro bono advocate \u2013 and ex-DWP employee \u2013 she found on Facebook. She won back the care component of her benefit but lost her appeal for help with her mobility needs. A 47-year-old woman, who has ME, osteoarthritis and nerve damage that leaves her incontinent, chose not even to go ahead with her appeal for Pip because, after waiting a year for a decision, she said that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have an ounce of strength and just couldn\u2019t face the stress\u201d. She had been receiving Pip\u2019s predecessor benefit, disability living allowance, for more than 15 years \u2013 and used some of it to pay the bedroom tax. Without winning at appeal, she is unable to afford a car and says she has \u201creached the point of being absolutely trapped\u201d. A man with mental health problems, who contacted me after his emergency help to pay for the bedroom tax was stopped, had to represent himself at appeal. \u201cIn my borough some of the first services cut by the council several years ago were welfare rights,\u201d he says. He lost and now has to pay the bedroom tax in full. In a climate of tightened benefit eligibility, flawed testing, and outright cuts, to block disabled people\u2019s chance at appeal is yet another way to tilt power in the DWP\u2019s favour. At a minimum, the benefit tribunal system \u2013 in reality, the hurdle disabled people must jump to be able to eat, buy a wheelchair, or get help to leave the house \u2013 must be accountable and accessible. As it is, the government is playing dirty tricks.",
