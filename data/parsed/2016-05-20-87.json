It also found that fewer than 2% of companies track costs on an ongoing basis. In a startup situation, careful cost management is particularly crucial. But where should you begin? Start as you mean to go on It\u2019s important to approach any new business mindful of the need to stay cash positive. When Tony Burns opened his bar/restaurant, Pinch in Liverpool in April 2015, he used his previous experience of running other small businesses to keep a close eye on the bottom line and stay focused on the end goal.  \u201cI knew that 50% of all small business startups fail within the first two years, but that a cost management strategy would give me a fighting chance,\u201d he says.  Once he\u2019d decided on the strategic positioning and timeline for the new business, Burns looked at what his monthly and yearly outgoings would be, both personally and for the restaurant. He spent hours researching the best deals on everything from coffee machines to cocktail glasses. This provided him with a good idea of what his costs and break-even figures would be. \u201cI then sought quotes for fitting out the bar/restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to get carried away when a builder shows you the latest lighting systems, but if it\u2019s not within budget it\u2019s not happening!\u201d It\u2019s also important to make sure you are getting the best possible deal on business services from day one \u2013 switching utility or telecoms providers, consolidating bills, and switching business bank accounts can all provide savings without a loss of value. Even if you stay with an existing provider, there may be scope for renegotiation. And if you do find a better deal, free-to-use services like The Current Account Switch Service (in the case of banking) can help make the process of switching seamless . Review costs regularly Companies should set aside time to review and challenge costs throughout the financial year. Consider whether each is still justified, or whether there might be a more cost-effective alternative. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to look at your cost management strategy on a regular basis to ensure you\u2019re getting the best deals. This can free up money to be spent elsewhere,\u201d Burns says.  Repeat Logo, a business logo design company, started up in August 2015. Since then it has followed a straightforward cost management strategy: \u201cto spend as little as we can,\u201d says Brian Lonsdale, managing director.  \u201cUsing our cloud accountancy software, we\u2019re able to see exactly where our cash is being spent,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis allows us to accurately capture a snapshot in real time of our costs \u2013 for example, staff salaries, premises, software and other items.\u201d Initially, the business lost sight of profits. \u201cIt gave us a scare with our cashflow,\u201d Lonsdale says. \u201cWe also spent a lot employing staff who weren\u2019t motivated, to the point that the costs outweighed the benefits.\u201d They now regularly review costs to stop them adversely impacting the bottom line. Track spending You can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t measure so keeping a close check on spending is a must, especially as the business grows. \u201cFinancial discipline includes timely reporting,\u201d says Alun Hindle, CEO of Medichecks, which provides private blood tests online. \u201cToo often, in the rush to build a business, there is no control over who can spend the company\u2019s money and by the time the information filters up to management, it\u2019s too late.\u201d As an online business, Medichecks allocates a sizable portion of its advertising budget to paid search fees. Hindle admits that in the past, a lack of experience and internal control led to its pay-per-click costs spiralling out of control. A cost management strategy can also help a new business anticipate quiet times of the year and plan for them. For Medichecks, \u201cDecember is not a good month for health-related spend,\u201d Hindle says. \u201cIn the past, this has led to a squeeze on cash when the fixed costs of the business must be met at a time of revenue shortfall. It\u2019s only a temporary issue, but it requires foresight.\u201d Plan for contingencies It\u2019s one thing to plan for foreseen costs, but what about unplanned expenses? A contingency fund can and should be built into any plan.  \u201cA cost strategy is a map of how you get your business from A to B, or startup to profit, and knowing what has to be achieved,\u201d says Burns. \u201cUsing signposts along the way means that you feel in control of your business instead of costs spiralling and it controlling you. But it\u2019s important to expect the unexpected.  \u201cExtensive building work meant that, instead of our planned opening in April 2015, we didn\u2019t start trading until the end of August. If I hadn\u2019t built in a contingency, the business would have been over before it began.\u201d Lean on experts Getting expert advice on your cost management strategy is advisable, especially if the company founders lack a background in finance.  Medichecks uses a financial consultant who \u201cproduces detailed monthly accounts which, for a fast-growing business, often look out of date as soon as they have been produced, but at least we know how each area has performed against budget,\u201d Hindle says. \u201cThis promotes discussion of costs and the effectiveness of any spending. We\u2019re able to quickly identify when something isn\u2019t working and shift resources to areas that will deliver a better return.\u201d The company has found value in using specialists in other areas too, for example to keep online advertising costs under control. \u201cWe now entrust this part of our budget to digital marketing experts, with strict limits and controls on what they can spend,\u201d Hindle explains. \u201cIdentifying weaknesses in the business and formulating strategies to address them is a key part of cost management.\u201d Invest in equipment and property Sometimes over-reliance on third parties can push up costs, however. Self-made entrepreneur David Ross, who started his first business at the age of 16, now runs a digital production agency, BOXFX, among other ventures.  BOXFX has bought its own equipment (rather than hiring this for each job), runs its own high-end editing suites and IT server farms and owns its own offices (rather than renting). Ross believes that asset ownership brings with it a greater control of costs.  \u201cWe\u2019ve planned for the long game,\u201d Ross says. \u201cAs an example, the office was costing us nearly \u00a360,000 a year in rent. Purchasing premises has given us more space, more control and means we\u2019re paying a lot less in running costs. We installed solar panels on the building with a three-four year earn-back plan, which should bring in over \u00a3130,000 over 25 years \u2013 a good return on the \u00a317,000 we put down.\u201d Content on this page is paid for and produced to a brief agreed with the Current Account Switch Service, sponsor of the Guardian Small Business Network managing your cashflow hub.",
