A live-action clip of Attenborough nestled amongst a colony of penguins is followed by a \u201ccreature comforts\u201d style interview with two of the starstruck birds.Film production: Aardman AnimationDirector: Rich Webber   Related: 'Ageism is so last century': Harvey Nichols uses 100-year-old model    Harvey Nichols: \u2018100\u2019 (starts at 01:58) - UK It\u2019s never too late to shine, it turns out. However old we are, it\u2019s the age we project that counts \u2013 and it\u2019s more about personality than Botox. So welcome to the face of Harvey Nichols\u2019 centenary: Bo Gilbert, who is herself 100 years old. Dressed in Dries Van Noten with Valentino specs, she cuts a tremendous figure in her photoshoot.Agency: adam&eveDDBDirector: Kell Mitchell Save The Children: \u2018A Second A Day\u2019 (starts at 04:02) - UK It may not seem possible to create a film about the Syrian crisis as impactful as Martin Stirling\u2019s extraordinary 2014 film but Tom Green\u2019s sequel is gut-wrenchingly affecting. The same young actor who played Lily in the original film becomes a refugee and through her plight this film makes the case for opening its arms to those in need.Agency: Don\u2019t PanicDirector: Tom Green Jason Stone is the editor of David Reviews",
