Compared to Cordeiro\u2019s other pupils who flourished under his guidance since the end of his competitive fighting days in 1999, that\u2019s no small statement about the success and skill of late-blooming revelation Fabricio Werdum.   Related: UFC owners reportedly considering deal to sell organization for $4bn    Werdum, 38, stands ready to anchor UFC 198 this Saturday in an event that stacks up as the biggest celebration of MMA \u200bBrazil has witnessed in \u200bits long history of watching these types of contests. In many ways it\u2019s fitting that Curitiba\u2019s Arena da Baixada \u2013 a 42,000-seat soccer venue that sold-out in nine hours \u2013 will host the UFC\u2019s first stadium event in South America. Based on the collective legacies of fighters like Cordeiro, who rose from the city\u2019s impoverished areas to create a future for themselves inside the fabled Chute Boxe Academy, the people of Curitiba deserve such a fistic spectacle to honor their own. From of the hardest of the hardcore in mixed-fighting \u2013 then known as \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d \u200bcontests sometimes featuring up to four bouts a night in demanding single-elimination tournaments \u2013 \u200bthe likes of Cordeiro, Anderson Silva, Jose \u2018Pele\u2019 Landi-Jons, Wanderlei Silva, Chris \u2018Cyborg\u2019 and \u2018Shogun\u2019 Rua asserted themselves under the Chute Boxe banner. They brought their style to the best in Brazil. Then they brought it the best in the world. For several years Chute Boxe sat atop the sport during a legendary run in Japan\u2019s seminal Pride Fighting Championship. The first time I saw Chute Boxe fighters in person was on the streets of Tokyo. Wanderlei Silva\u200b was set to fight Dan Henderson a couple days later, on December 23 2000, at Pride 12. He walked alongside a handful of men, including the team\u2019s founders Rudimar Fedrigo, and Cordeiro, who then and now smiles more often than not. Silva, a brooding light heavyweight, made me nervous with a quick glance from underneath his hoodie. It didn\u2019t seem implausible that like a leashed jaguar out for exercise he could snap. That fight with Henderson is among the most vicious I\u2019ve seen in person\u200b. Pride 12 featured representatives from the major branches of Brazilian MMA: Vale Tudo (Muay Thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu), Luta Livre (\u201cfree fighting\u201d rooted in catch wrestling and judo) and, of course, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, the famous familial art derived and evolved from judo. In Brazil, \u200banything went, bare knuckles and all. Chute Boxe fighters relished these circumstances until the action became popularized and they needed to adapt their\u200b tactics to fit more structured boxes. By the time Anderson Silva left Chute Boxe in 2003 following a contractual dispute with the team\u2019s management arm, the\u200b school had come to represent a pioneering force in MMA.  Far silkier a fighter than most of his old teammates\u200b, Silva was well served by striking out on his own, though some fans\u200b have not forgiven him for his divorce from Curitiba\u2019s once dominant and fabled fight team. Notwithstanding this week\u2019s unfortunate news \u200bof Silva\u2019s emergency surgery to relieve him from the excruciating pain of a burst gallbladder, the lineup for UFC 198 remains loaded with 14 Brazilians, including well-known and about-to-be discovered fighters with Chute Boxe ties. As the UFC raises the profile of mixed fights in Curitiba, MMA in Brazil has become more homogenous and an accepted part of the culture than ever before. That evolution also means most gyms tend not train like Cordeiro and his squad did when they went about their business in the 1990s. By current standards, though, Cordeiro\u2019s facility in Huntington Beach, California, still keeps it rough. Fighters at Kings MMA spar full-go twice a week, and whatever magic he instilled in his top \u200bfighters has undoubtedly soaked into Werdum and another current UFC champion, lightweight Rafael dos Anjos. For all of Werdum\u2019s ability as a fighter, his status as UFC heavyweight champion, and his charisma outside of the cage, \u2018Vai Cavalo,\u2019 the \u2018go horse,\u2019 would not be the man many Brazilians think of first to headline the UFC\u2019s third massive arena show since 2015. Hailing from Porto Alegre, \u200ba short flight south from Curitiba, Werdum claimed his spot in the main event ahead of icons like Anderson Silva, Vitor Belfort and Chute Boxe\u2019s powerhouse female fighter Cris\u200b Justino, who makes her long-awaited UFC debut on the undercard. He has held up well in that role. Eleven months ago, Werdum (20-5-1) put together a superlative effort to topple Cain Velasquez in Mexico City, and after an aborted rematch, the 6ft 4in multiple-time Brazilian jiu-jitsu world champion will finally attempt the first defense of his belt against the American Stipe Miocic (14-2), a formidable 33-year-old boxer-wrestler. During five-plus years under Cordeiro\u2019s guidance, Werdum went from a relatively uninspiring mixed martial artist to one with the capacity and wherewithal to dominate. No heavyweight in UFC history has defended the title more than two consecutive times, an indication of the parity and danger that exists when skilled big men square off in the Octagon. If any fighter is poised to break the mold it\u2019s Werdum, who in 2010 became the first mixed martial artist in nearly a decade to topple Russian great Fedor Emelianenko. The truth about Werdum is that, after venturing into martial arts for the first time after the age of 20, he won everything he set his mind to. Should that happen again, and again, Curitiba will celebrate, and debates over Werdum\u2019s place on Cordeiro\u2019s list of star students would be settled, shifting the discussion to where he stands among MMA\u2019s all-time best heavyweights.",
