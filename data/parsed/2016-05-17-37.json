The Department of Health and British Medical Association believe that after what both privately describe as positive negotiations in the last 10 days, the outline of a revised contract for junior doctors in England will be published.  \u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d a source with knowledge of the discussions said. Insiders said the talks, which began on 9 May, had produced significant progress on a range of key issues. The independent Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas), which has overseen the latest search for a resolution, is expected to say that the BMA, DH and NHS Employers have finally reached agreement on the details of a new contract for England\u2019s 55,000 trainee medics.  \u201cThe talks have gone well,\u201d said another source close to the negotiations. However, another said there were \u201cstill hard yards to go\u201d before all outstanding issues were resolved.   Related: Is the junior doctors\u2019 strike justified? | The panel    The Guardian understands that the deal includes a resolution of the thorny issue of how much of a Saturday should become part of a junior doctor\u2019s normal working week. The previous talks fell apart in early February when the BMA, the doctors\u2019 union, refused to discuss what was the main remaining sticking point.  That prompted Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, to end those talks and decide to impose a version of the contract that would make Saturdays up until 5pm part of junior doctors\u2019 \u201cplain time\u201d, with some being paid 30% more for working then.  Sources say BMA negotiators, led by Dr Johann Malawana, may have conceded the principle of Saturday working to help Hunt introduce the seven-day NHS ministers have promised, but agreed that it will last only until 1pm. Sources say Hunt has agreed to end an anomaly that means junior doctors are the only staff in the NHS who do not enjoy legal protection if they blow the whistle on bad care or other dubious practice.  Whether or not the deal is enough to end months of industrial action by junior doctors will depend on the outcome of a ballot among the 45,000 junior doctors who belong to the BMA.  Much will rest on whether Malawana, the chair of the BMA\u2019s junior doctors committee, endorses or rejects the deal, given his popularity among BMA members.  Malawana told the BMA junior doctors\u2019 annual conference last Saturday: \u201cWe\u2019re talking. They\u2019re listening. We\u2019re listening too. If this were a movie, I\u2019d now pull out a large envelope with the word \u2018deal\u2019 written on it. We\u2019re not there, and I can\u2019t even add the word \u2018yet\u2019 to the end of that sentence.\u201d  He noted that the negotiations, supervised by the Acas chairman, Sir Brendan Barber, were being held \u201cin a spirit of constructive engagement\u201d, which he said \u201cmight just be a good way of conducting business in the wider NHS\u201d. Tens of thousands of junior doctors have taken part in stoppages on eight days since January, leading to the cancellation of almost 40,000 planned, non-urgent operations and more than 100,000 outpatient appointments.  For two days last month they withdrew cover even in areas of life-or-death care, such as A&E, intensive care, maternity services and emergency surgery, in the first-ever total walkout by junior doctors across the NHS. Last month Hunt refused to reopen negotiations and insisted that \u201cthe matter is closed\u201d and that he would impose his own version of the contract on junior doctors from August onwards. However, he changed his mind after a last-ditch plea from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges for both sides to stage a five-day truce to allow time-limited fresh talks. They were supposed to end last Friday but were extended to allow more time, to enhance the prospects of success.  The BMA said it could not say when its ballot would start or how long it would take to produce a result.",
