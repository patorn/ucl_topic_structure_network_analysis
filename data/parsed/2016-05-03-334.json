  "body": "Ah yes, Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, the lady with the stripey house in Kensington. Red and white, vertical stripes. Not because she supports Sunderland, or Stoke City, or Southampton (to be honest, Zipporah doesn\u2019t strike me as being the footy fan type). But because she just wanted to annoy the neighbours: she\u2019s one of these Posh Neighbours at War (Channel 4). It started when ZL-M outbid South African Niall Carroll and bought the property, for \u00a34.75m. Niall already lived in the house next door, for which he paid \u00a311.5m, but he fancied a bit of extra space. He was cross about missing out. When Zipporah submitted her plans to turn her property into a luxury house with a basement and swimming pool, Niall, who lives in a luxury house with a basement and swimming pool, objected. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can say: \u2018Well, because the Queen has a tiara then everybody else should be allowed a tiara,\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cI mean, you know, it\u2019s a separate set of circumstances.\u201d Zipporah submitted further plans \u2013 tiaras, cavernous two-storey basements, gyms and subterranean swimming pools, everything \u2013 Niall and others objected, the plans were refused, she appealed and won, Niall took it to the high court, permission was quashed, Zipporah painted her stripes \u2026 which set off a whole new round and level of squabbling in the magistrates\u2019 court, back to the high court again. Where next, the European court of human rights? The right for red stripes, to dig deep and swim underground? Quick, hurry, while we still belong. Maybe only God can settle this one. There are other posh neighbours at war. In Notting Hill, the writer Rachel Johnson is raging about all the new basements being dug. \u201cAntisocial, from soup to nuts,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like cigarettes at a dinner party: as soon as someone lights up, everyone wants one.\u201d I think dinner parties play an important part in Rachel\u2019s life, judging by her figures of speech. She takes a writer\u2019s revenge, not stripes or legal action, she puts her enemies in a novel. See you in Fresh Hell. There is the faint whiff of snobbery, of vulgar new arrivals \u2013 new money probably \u2013 not playing by the rules. In Hampstead, it\u2019s noisy leaf-blowers that are bothering Tom Conti. And in Buckinghamshire, the Hon Christopher and Mardi Gilmour, originally popular (they say) simply for not being Tony and Cherie Blair, who also expressed an interest in buying Winslow Hall, have now fallen out with some of the locals by staging an opera festival. They should do Stravinsky, in modern dress and updated, The Leaf Blower\u2019s Progress, turned up to 11, then invite Tom. \u201cOne person said he wouldn\u2019t complain if it was a rock concert, so clearly it wasn\u2019t the noise, it was just a matter of taste,\u201d says Mardi mardily. But the show really belongs to Zipporah and to Niall, and the makers did well to get both parties to play. Amusing to watch, but it\u2019s also quite frightening how something relatively petty can get so out of hand. Blinded by jealousy, stubbornness and vindictiveness, they\u2019ve lost all sense of what\u2019s important. And it\u2019s not just the obscene sums being spent on lawyers and legal costs, and the waste of court time \u2013 they\u2019re also wasting and ruining their lives. Tragically. Actually, it would make a half decent libretto. What is Italian for stripes?     A whole load of great lines \u2026 Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Selina Meyer in Veep. Photograph: HBO     Related: The disgraceful genius of Julia Louis-Dreyfus    Armando Iannucci may have stepped down after four terms in charge of Veep (Sky Atlantic), but he\u2019s left Chris Addison over there directing. And of course it now has Hugh Laurie, playing Selina Meyer\u2019s running mate/\u201csmug, Dick Van Dyke looking motherfucker\u201d Tom James. Still a bit of Brit in it, innit, even if it is now written by Americans. Veep has always felt like that to me, a baby given birth to in America but conceived here (which it is \u2013 that\u2019s probably why). I think that\u2019s also why I\u2019ve never quite believed in it the way I believed The Thick Of It. It doesn\u2019t make it any less razor-sharp, gloriously sweary or hilarious, though. And the good news is that none of that seems to have changed. A lovely opener to season five, including a nice cameo from a stress pimple/dog nipple/zitzilla on the side of Meyer\u2019s face that causes the Dow Jones to crash. And a whole load of great lines such as: \u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re at symposium-on-race-desperate yet.\u201d Armando who?",
