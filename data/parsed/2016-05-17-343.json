Related: 'I need help': Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau's plea sparks anger in Canada    On Monday, Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, announced his government would table legislation to ensure \u201cthe full protection\u201d of transgender people, following up on a promise made during the fall election campaign. \u201cWe must continue to demand true equality,\u201d Trudeau said in Montreal. \u201cWe must carry on the legacy of those who fought for justice by being bold and ambitious in our actions and we must work diligently to close the gap between our principles and our reality.\u201d The legislation, set to be introduced in the House of Commons on Tuesday, is expected to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity in the Canadian Human Rights Act, adding it to a list of characteristics such as race, religion and sexual orientation. Hate speech provisions in the country\u2019s criminal code are also expected to be extended to transgender people. Trudeau pointed to the recent assault of two men as they were leaving a bar in Montreal, describing it as a hate crime. \u201cThey were attacked because of the love they were showing for each other. That is simply unacceptable.\u201d     We must always work to fight homophobia & transphobia. I\u2019m honoured to be recognized by @fondemergence tonight. pic.twitter.com/St8q2cc91F\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) May 16, 2016    Incidents like these happened too often, he added. \u201cI sincerely believe that in Canada we can and must do more. Not just here, for us, but to show the rest of the world that an open and free society is the greatest thing we can aspire to together.\u201d The legislation comes as Canada\u2019s neighbours to the south are in the grips of a divisive debate over transgender rights. In March, the state of North Carolina became the first to enact a controversial \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, requiring transgender people to use the restrooms that correspond to the sex stated on their birth certificate.  The debate, which has pitted liberals against social conservatives across the United States, could expose similar fault lines in Canada. More than 1,000 people turned out across Alberta on Sunday to protest provincial legislation, passed last year and known as Bill 10, that allows students in the province to use the bathrooms and change rooms that correspond to the gender they identify with. \u201cBill 10 fundamentally and profoundly undermines the parents\u2019 choice to provide the kind of education that should be given to their children,\u201d protestor Theresa Ng told media.    Related: Maple Match: service helps Trump-fleeing Americans find love in Canada    Attempts to enshrine the rights of transgender people at the federal level in Canada date back to 2004. In 2013 legislation was passed by the House of Commons but later died in the senate after being stalled over proposed amendments added by a Conservative senator.  As Trudeau\u2019s government holds a majority in the House of Commons, the bill is expected to pass easily, but it remains to be seen whether the senate \u2013 an unelected body in Canada \u2013 will again allow legislation on this issue to languish.  A major difference this time around is the backing of the government. Trudeau, who announced earlier this year that he would be the first prime minister to march in Toronto\u2019s pride parade, was in Montreal on Monday to accept an award recognising his continued commitment to fighting homophobia and transphobia.  The announcement came as Montreal continues to reel from an attempted arson on the country\u2019s only clinic carrying out comprehensive sex reassignment surgery. Police said the matter is still under investigation and all motives are being considered.",
