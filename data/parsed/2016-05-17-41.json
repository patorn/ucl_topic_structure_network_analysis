There wasn\u2019t even a final \u201cGet outta my pub!\u201d as she bowed out privately and alone, taking an overdose. It put an end to her 22-year career in the soap and left fans bereft. In her final week, Peggy was a more subdued version of herself, cruising down the Thames, soaking up the London that she loved and riding round Albert Square on the back of a milkfloat. Walking through the Queen Vic for one last time, glammed up to the nines and buying champers for all, she saw her life flash before her eyes.     In her final week, Peggy was a more subdued version of herself. Photograph: BBC/Kieron McCarron    If the moment she gave Linda her seal of approval as the new landlady didn\u2019t make you cry, the sight of her walking out of that pub arm-in-arm with Phil and Grant did the trick. \u201cJust in case you didn\u2019t know it, you boys, you\u2019re my world,\u201d she said.     A brassy blond and a battleaxe \u2026 Peggy serving champers to all. Photograph: BBC    EastEnders has no shortage of brassy blondes, battleaxes and women who\u2019ll display a wolf-like devotion to their children, but no one did it quite like Peggy. She was the quintessential East End matriarch: ruling the Queen Vic with a bust of iron, fiercely protecting her family and hating any woman who dared to cross her boys.  In the early days, Peggy was played by Jo Warne, but it\u2019s Barbara Windsor\u2019s incarnation of the character since 1994 who has become legendary. She mixed a little of the Carry On cackle with a proper old East End hard-as-acrylic-nails attitude. Strong, glamorous women have always ruled behind the bar at the Queen Vic and Peggy\u2019s glory years were spent there, holding court and taking no prisoners. She was at her most triumphant when she wrestled control of the pub after discovering that Sharon had been doing the double with Phil and Grant.           Peggy Mitchell\u2019s most memorable moments in EastEnders    Peggy\u2019s the only woman who could keep her boys under control. \u201cFaaa-mily always comes first\u201d was her motto. That\u2019s not to say she turned a blind eye to their faults. When Phil became a crack addict, she took matters into her own hands and locked him in the pub. (Sadly that didn\u2019t work \u2013 he burned it down.) When Chrissie Watts tried to frame Peggy\u2019s daughter Sam for Dirty Den\u2019s murder, she pushed her into an open grave.     Peggy with her beloved beefcake Frank Butcher. Photograph: Adrian Rogers/BBC-1    Although she\u2019s remembered fondly as a character, Peggy was far from an out-an-out good person, as she proved by launching a hate campaign against HIV-positive Mark Fowler. Her magic came from the drama, the flamboyant insults and the soft core that had a way of cutting to the heart of the audience. She had the cockney cockroach-like ability to claw her way back from life\u2019s big traumas, which she suffered in spades. Unlucky in love doesn\u2019t begin to describe it: her beloved beefcake Frank Butcher ran off with his old flame Pat just as they were about to renew their vows. She didn\u2019t take it lying down, administering a double slapping of Pat and Frank. It was heartbreaking to see evil Archie trying to control her, but once again she bounced back, head (and hair) held high.     Not one to take things lying down \u2026 Peggy slaps Phil after he calls her a nag. Photograph: BBC    Peggy was strong, warm and despite all the slaps and shouting, she was vulnerable, as she showed when she admitted how terrified she was after being diagnosed with breast cancer.  As she told Phil: \u201cCancer\u2019s not having the last word. I am.\u201d Whether it was EastEnders shying away from showing the full horror of someone dying of cancer, or Peggy taking one final bit of control, it was harrowing to see her slip away.",
