  "body": "The New Zealand police force has released a video of officers doing the \u201crunning man\u201d dance and issued a challenge to other forces around the world to do the same in an unorthodox recruitment drive. The 30-second clip, dubbed the #runningmanchallenge, is part of a year-long campaign by the New Zealand police force, which wants to sign up 400 new officers by the end of 2016, particularly of Maori, Pacific Island, Asian, Middle Eastern and Indian descent.    Related: Social experiment shows hundreds ignoring 'homeless boy' in New Zealand    In the video eight police officers in uniform dance in a basement car park. A post on the force\u2019s Facebook page that accompanies the video reads: \u201cWe catch people on the run everyday, this was a new #runningmanchallenge for our team.\u201d International police forces tagged in the post included those in Australia, the US and the UK. On Wednesday afternoon the New York City Police Department (NYPD) accepted the challenge and created their own video on a soggy pier in front of the Brooklyn Bridge.     NYPD responds to New Zealand police force\u2019s #runningmanchallenge   Already watched nearly a million times, the NYPD recruited six local kids to help them one-up the Kiwis.  In their video the NYPD challenged The New York City Fire Department, Boston Police Department and Police Scotland to take up the challenge. The LAPD also responded to New Zealand\u2019s challenge but are yet to post a video.     .@nzpolice - We'd better start stretching now, it looks like the bar has been set pretty high \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udfc3 \ud83d\udcaf https://t.co/KX4xqpme0a\u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) May 4, 2016    Meanwhile in Australia, the Northern Territory police are \u201c actively considering\u201d creating a video, and Victoria state police commissioner Graham Ashton tweeted \u201cNice effort@nzpolice - leave it with us...\u201d However, the Isles of Scilly police have ruled out taking part. In a Facebook post, sergeant Colin \u201cdad dance\u201d Taylor said dance was not his team\u2019s strong point. \u201cI note that the gauntlet has been laid down by [New Zealand police] for a dance off with us. \u201cI also note that they can draw on a supporting cast of thousands of officers and staff whereas we have a modest team of five and occasionally a cat. Our combined age on this small rock in the Atlantic (including feline years) is over 300.\u201d \u201cWe wish NZ Police the very best with their recruitment drive. It certainly is a remarkable career even if you have to do it upside down dancing on the ceiling.\u201d The New Zealand video, which was posted on Facebook on Tuesday, has been viewed nearly four million times.  The star of the clip, 43-year-old Sergeant Sonny Joseph Iosefo, became a police officer 20 years ago after following family members into the force. Iosefo said he had a \u201clifelong passion for dance\u201d and would often dance at family picnics and at home with his wife and six-year-old son.  \u201cIf we can make someone laugh on the street, that makes our job so much easier,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to get away from the stereotypes the public hold about police officers, that they can\u2019t talk to us, that we are really serious people. We want people to know that we are humans too, we have families, we have children, and some of us love to dance.\u201d Iosefa said the dance moves he and his fellow uniformed officers used in the video clip were \u201ca little bit Samoan inspired\u201d as per his cultural history.  \u201cDance is embedded in our blood and our culture, and I like to bring that out. Trying to connect with young people, and trying to diffuse tension, it really helps if you can make someone smile.  \u201cWe want a diverse force that is part of the community, not just policing it.\u201d",
