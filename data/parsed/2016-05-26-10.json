  "body": "Marco Rubio has signaled a thaw in his attitude to Donald Trump, saying that if asked he will speak on behalf of his former rival at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July.    Related: Marco Rubio: 'It\u2019s not that we lost, it\u2019s that Donald Trump won'    The Florida senator was less willing to come around on the matter of seeking re-election, even as top Republicans mount a campaign to pressure him into doing so. Rubio, who dropped out of the presidential race in March, after losing his home state to Trump, told CNN he planned to attend the Republican convention and would be willing to help the nominee \u2013 despite differences on policy and the brutal echoes of a primary in which, responding to the billionaire\u2019s taunts, Rubio called Trump a \u201ccon artist\u201d and said he was too \u201cerratic\u201d to have access to the nuclear codes.  \u201cYes \u2013 I\u2019d certainly, yes,\u201d Rubio said when asked if he would speak for Trump. \u201cI want to be helpful. I don\u2019t want to be harmful because I don\u2019t want Hillary Clinton to be president. \u201cLook, my policy differences with Donald Trump \u2013 I spent 11 months talking about them,\u201d he added in the interview, which will air in full on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday.  \u201cSo I think they\u2019re well understood. That said, I don\u2019t want Hillary Clinton to be president. If there\u2019s something I can do to help that from happening, and it\u2019s helpful to the cause, I\u2019d most certainly be honored to be considered for that.\u201d Although Rubio had already committed to backing Trump, his latest comments stood in stark contrast to the impassioned pleas he made when the two were squaring off just months ago. In the final weeks of his campaign, Rubio embraced the #NeverTrump hashtag. Speaking to the Guardian the day before he left the race, he said Trump was \u201can embarrassment\u201d for whom the Republican party would \u201cpay a big price in November and beyond\u201d. \u201cYou have all kinds of people that are lifelong conservatives, or at least claim to be, who don\u2019t seem to care that Donald Trump has never been and is not now a conservative on principles,\u201d Rubio said in that interview, on the eve of the 15 March Florida primary. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve staked their reputation on their support of him.\u201d  To CNN, Rubio also said he would release the 167 delegates he secured in winning the Minnesota, Puerto Rico and District of Columbia primaries. But he again ruled out any interest in serving as Trump\u2019s running mate. \u201cHe won the nomination and he deserves to have a running mate that more fully embraces some of the things he stands for,\u201d Rubio said.  Later in the day, the senator explained to Florida reporters that Trump was \u201csubstantially better\u201d than Clinton and he would vote for him. \u201cThe one other choice is someone who I believe is corrupt,\u201d Rubio said, according to the Miami Herald. \u201cI\u2019m not supporting her, and I\u2019m not going to abstain from voting.\u201d Separately, Rubio spent much of the day trying to quell speculation that he might reconsider his decision not to run for re-election. On Thursday Republican leaders in the Senate openly encouraged him to reverse course, ahead of Florida\u2019s filing deadline on 24 June. In a closed-door lunch, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, conducted a poll in which virtually everyone raised their hands when asked if the 44-year-old should jump back into the race. John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, called on Rubio to do so, as did the foreign relations committee chairman, Bob Corker. Corker, from Tennessee, said in a statement: \u201cMarco Rubio is a very valuable member of the Senate \u2013 especially in his role on the Senate foreign relations committee, where he demonstrates a deep understanding of foreign policy.\u201d Rubio has repeatedly insisted that from January he will be a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d once again. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the senator said: \u201cFor me, I need time to even talk to anybody about it, but my sense of it is nothing has changed in my thinking. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was fair for me to run for president and freeze that seat in a competitive state \u2026 I made that decision and I\u2019ve lived by that decision. Nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d Republicans have voiced growing concerns over the Florida Senate race, in which a crowded primary has threatened the party\u2019s chances. A longtime friend of Rubio, Florida\u2019s lieutenant governor, Carlos Lopez-Cantera, is among the Republican hopefuls. Rubio has edged closer to endorsing Lopez-Cantera, hosting a fundraiser in Washington earlier this month. \u201cI have a very close personal friend in this race and I think he\u2019s a good candidate,\u201d Rubio said. Asked how he would respond if Lopez-Cantera were to bow out, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t do hypotheticals.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like the Democrats have the greatest candidate,\u201d Rubio added, in reference to Democratic contenders Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson, both of whom serve in the House of Representatives.  \u201cOne guy keeps exaggerating his biography and the other guy is a certified lunatic.\u201d",
