  "body": "Four years ago Tom Daley stood on the 10m board here with the country waiting expectantly. Much has changed for the 21-year-old since then and, after claiming an emphatic European gold to blow his rivals out of the water, there was a moment to reflect. \u201cI will never, ever experience more pressure than standing on the end of the board, looking down at the Olympic rings for my final dive with 18,000 people in the audience in London and millions of people watching at home,\u201d said Daley of his experience in 2012, when he won bronze. \u201cThere will never be a more pressurised moment in my life than that moment and I managed to handle it. I feel now, as a diver, I am so much better.\u201d How he proved it. Daley, below, dove to a comfortable victory and claimed his second gold at these championships in the 10m platform, doing so in some style with a score of 570.50 \u2013 not far short of a personal best \u2013 and beating the Russian Victor Minibaev, his nearest competitor, by 45.90 points. To put the performance in context, it would have been enough to take gold at London 2012 and there was also an encouraging display by Britain\u2019s 18-year-old Matthew Lee, who finished the competition in fifth. Daley\u2019s victory marked a satisfying denouement to Britain\u2019s diving efforts at these championships, with the team having excelled beyond expectations and topping the medal table three months before the Rio Olympics. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with how it went, it was close to my personal best,\u201d said Daley. \u201cThe thing is, there is so much more in the tank, everything could have sharpened up a little. In training I can get all my dives in 10s, one day I will get them all together. \u201cIn theory I\u2019m at peak age. I feel like I\u2019m diving the best I\u2019ve ever dived, consistently, and it\u2019s really exciting moving forward to the Olympic Games because it\u2019s one of those events where anything can happen, it\u2019s outdoors and there are so many factors. I feel like I\u2019m in the best place I possibly can be. \u201cI\u2019m more advanced with my experience, my power, my ability, just my mental stability and how I want to fight for every single thing in a competition. I\u2019m in a different place than I was four years ago. Going into Rio it\u2019s nice to think there will never be a situation as pressurised as that, there will be pressure don\u2019t get me wrong, but I don\u2019t have the home crowd there expecting me to win a medal.\u201d On Britain\u2019s overall improvement, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s the most medals we\u2019ve ever won at a European Championships, the most before was two. We\u2019re doing the best we\u2019ve ever done. There are so many different reasons, the UK Sport lottery funding we\u2019ve been getting since 2012 has increased our facilities, new pools across the country. The way that our performance director, Alexei [Evangulov], has performance-managed British Diving, he was over in 2008 and if you look at the difference in British diving since then it\u2019s miraculous really.\u201d Five of Daley\u2019s six dives in the competition scored between 96.20 and 99 points, saving his best for last with an almost flawless back three-and-a-half somersaults. It was certainly a message to his Chinese rivals, who will provide a sterner test at the Games this summer, and Daley\u2019s former coach Andy Banks \u2013 who is still part of the GB setup \u2013 said: \u201cIt was fantastic, 570 is a very, very good score. A performance like that I think will get on the podium in Rio. It\u2019s a question of where, because those Chinese are so good. It\u2019s probably the best championships we\u2019ve ever had, we\u2019ve never had so many medals before. Confidence has got to be strong going into the Games.\u201d Britain finished the day with a final medal in the women\u2019s 3m synchronised event, Alicia Blagg and Rebecca Gallantree taking silver with a score of 319.32 from five dives, the country\u2019s 11th medal in total at the championships before the swimming begins on Monday.",
