  "body": "The lack of freedom afforded to you by being famous feels a bit like \u201chaving your limbs cut off\u201d, Kristen Stewart told press at the Cannes film festival. The actor was speaking at the press conference for Olivier Assayas\u2019s supernatural drama, Personal Shopper. The second film at Cannes in which she stars (the other is Woody Allen\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Society, which opened the festival last week), Personal Shopper sees her play Maureen, a psychic medium who, during daylight hours, assists a famous fashion model with her clothing choices.   Related: Personal Shopper review: Kristen Stewart's psychic spooker is a must-have    Stewart said she liked how \u201ccapable\u201d her character was and \u2013 as someone who relies on personal assistants herself \u2013 said she envied Maureen\u2019s freedom. \u201c[You] feel so incapable of going to the store. Well, technically you can, but it proves to be logistically not worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was fun to play somebody who was so capable. Sometimes I do feel a little bit like I have my limbs cut off. That\u2019s not to say that [fame] is a bad feeling, but it is surreal.\u201d Assayas\u2019s film combines fashion industry satire with family drama and supernatural horror. Maureen is grieving for her twin, Lewis, who was also a medium. The pair agreed before he died that the first of them to go would send a sign to the other if an afterlife exists. We join Maureen as she waits for Lewis to make contact. Asked if she herself believed in ghosts Stewart said that, while she had been afraid of them as a kid, she was agnostic about the existence of the supernatural.     Kristen Stewart In Personal Shopper Photograph: PR Image    \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m really sensitive \u2013 this is going to look great in quotes \u2013 I\u2019m really sensitive to energies. I truly believe that I\u2019m driven by something that I can\u2019t really define and so I can\u2019t necessarily take responsibility for it, but it gives me the feeling that we\u2019re not so alone.\u201d Personal Shopper met with a mixed reaction from critics after its first screening at Cannes last night, with some members of the audience greeting it with boos, the same form of feedback that was delivered to Andrea Arnold\u2019s American Honey last week. Asked if the vocal reception had bothered him, Assayas, a festival regular, laughed and said that he had come to expect the unexpected from Cannes. \u201cMovies have a life of their own,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting about Cannes is that yesterday no one had seen this film and today it\u2019s in front of the whole world. It\u2019s a very instant, very powerful moment. It\u2019s like giving birth. People have expectations about what it will be. You expect anything at Cannes. You just go with the flow\u201d.

Both Stewart and Eidinger have worked Assayas before on his film Clouds of Sils Maria. That film premiered in competition at Cannes two years ago. Stewart, again playing the role of a personal assistant to a celebrity, went on to become the first American female actor to win the C\u00e9sar award, France\u2019s equivalent of an Oscar. \u201cThere\u2019s a flame that he lights under my ass that is stronger than I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d she said of her working relationship with Assayas. \u201cI navigate my career by feel, and I feel him.\u201d In a central scene in Personal Shopper Maureen is plagued by an unknown virtual assailant who sends her frightening text messages. Stewart, while answering a question about the nature of modern technology with her thoughts on how dangerous it is to get too disconnected from the real world, was interrupted by a mobile phone owned by one of the press. \u201cWhat the hell?!,\u201d she said. During the press conference, an assistant \u2013 a tall, broad man in a dark suit \u2013 stood to the side of the room holding a pair of trainers for Stewart to wear when she was ready to leave.",
