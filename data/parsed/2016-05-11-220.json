  "body": "Name: First-class carriages. Age: As old as the rail network itself. Status: Subject to a reduced service. Possibly. What? How dare you! I pay thousands of pounds a year for my first-class ticket! OK. The government is proposing a reduction in the space set aside for first-class travel, in order to beat the scourge of overcrowding on busy rail routes. But I love travelling first class. Of course you do. That\u2019s because you\u2019re a snooty one-percenter who wouldn\u2019t be seen dead slumming it with the rest of the population. I bet you buy Speedy Boarding when you fly easyJet too, don\u2019t you? What\u2019s an easyJet? Never mind \u2026 Look, a west coast mainline consultation document has suggested a change in the balance of first- and standard-class coaches, because overcrowding causes untold misery for millions of passengers a year. It\u2019s a good idea. Please explain overcrowding. Fine. People who buy standard-class tickets between, say, London and Manchester, regularly have to stand for the entire two-and-a-quarter-hour trip, which seems a bit off since a peak-time single ticket costs \u00a3166. That\u2019s their problem, not mine. But wouldn\u2019t it be nice to know that you were giving up a sliver of luxury in order to help your fellow man? No! That sounds terrible! I cloister myself away from that rabble for a reason. I don\u2019t think that matters. A new operator will run the west cost mainline from 2018, and the franchise will probably be given to whoever takes up the government\u2019s suggestion. But if they\u2019re getting rid of first class, does that mean \u2026 Yes, it does. It means we\u2019re all either getting promoted to first-class passengers, or you\u2019re getting a demotion. This cannot be allowed to happen. I\u2019m better than you people. Oh, whatever. I\u2019ll see you sitting on the floor in a footwell next to a malfunctioning toilet on the 7:42 to Manchester. No! I must stop this, however I can. Have you thought about full-stop tweeting a rail operator in anger, like all the other frustrated commuters do? Well, no, I\u2019m not a monster. Thank God for that. Do say: \u201cFinally, British rail travel becomes a meritocracy.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cAn expensive, uncomfortable, unreliable meritocracy that will inevitably drive us all to our graves.\u201d",
