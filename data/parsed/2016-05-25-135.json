Two brothers snuggle under a blanket, while several children stroll the aisles. Many are wearing noise-reducing ear defenders. The audience is enjoying the first dedicated autism-friendly performance of Wicked, the award-winning West End musical, on Saturday 14 May, and the atmosphere in the theatre is almost palpably celebratory and joyful.    Related: Autism heroes: Guardian readers send in their stories    The show\u2019s producer Michael McCabe is delighted to host the event. \u201cWe know how important and inspiring live theatre can be for young people and we want to share that with everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to provide the right environment for all families to be able to share a special experience and treat together.\u201d  After careful preparation with the assistance of the National Autistic Society (NAS), the show has been specially adapted to reduce sensory difficulties \u2013 modifying lighting and sound effects and removing some shock elements \u2013 while staff and cast have received specialist training, and families are absolutely free to move around and make as much noise as they like.  \u201cWe want people to relax and enjoy the experience, knowing that no one is judging them,\u201d says McCabe. \u201cWicked is a story about friendship, acceptance and doing right, so doing this feels particularly rewarding and humbling.\u201d Fittingly, there are loud cheers when one of the lead characters, Elphaba, finds acceptance in the land of Oz after a lifetime of exclusion, announcing happily: \u201cNobody is pointing, nobody is staring. I\u2019m somewhere I belong.\u201d Angela and Terry Gallagher are here with daughter Molly, 21, and son Kieran, 20, who is autistic. \u201cKieran absolutely loved it,\u201d says Angela after the show. \u201cHe enjoyed all the special effects and got really involved. An audience normally just claps politely but he really joins in. It is very genuine feedback!\u201d Inclusive theatre performances offer a rare opportunity for Kieran to enjoy theatre and follow the story. \u201cHe would find a pitch black theatre or silent audience too stressful and he needs space to walk around,\u201d says Angela. The audience helped make the occasion special, she adds. \u201cThere was a real feeling of solidarity \u2013 a sense that everyone understood. That made Kieran feel freer and the fact that we didn\u2019t have to contain him all the time meant we could all relax.\u201d For Louise Williams, attending the show with her sons James, eight, who is autistic, and George, nine, the experience has been a \u201chugely positive one\u201d.  \u201cJames was very curious about the theatre and the show. He was so excited and happy at the start and he loved the effects,\u201d she says. Persuading him to leave the house can be very difficult, she adds, so successful family outings provide both a much-needed break and an invaluable confidence boost. As the audience files out after the show, two girls \u2013 Hope, nine, and Kiera, 10 \u2013 are singing a song from the show while poring over a programme as they try to choose their favourite parts. The girls met for the first time as they took their seats in the theatre, going on to comfort each other through sad or potentially frightening scenes.  This rapport, their mothers agree, has been another element of a wonderful experience. It is one Hope is keen to repeat: \u201cCan we come again? I loved it!\u201d To find out more about autism, the person, and what to do visit autism.org.uk/tmi",
