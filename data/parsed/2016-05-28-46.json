  "body": "Steve Bruce dedicated Hull City\u2019s play-off victory to the chairman, Assem Allam and said the club would be ready to make an impact in the Premier League next season after bouncing back at the first time of asking. Mohamed Diam\u00e9\u2019s superb strike in the 72nd minute ensured a narrow 1-0 win for Hull over Sheffield Wednesday, earning Bruce his fourth promotion from the Championship. He offered to step down one year ago after relegation from the top flight but Allam persuaded him to stay and the owner is currently in hospital with a serious illness.

It is they, not Carlos Carvalhal\u2019s side, who will benefit from the riches of a new TV deal in the Premier League next season and Bruce was relieved to have secured promotion. \u201cI\u2019m delighted,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cThe goal itself was a wonder goal that would grace any cup final. I honestly thought we had had too many real good chances and on a big occasion like today you can\u2019t keep missing. I think we had five or six really gilt-edged ones. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long five weeks since we realised we couldn\u2019t get automatic promotion. I thought I went through the wringer last week against Derby. Today in the last 15 minutes when they put the land of the giants on I thought: \u2018Dear oh dear.\u2019 But I think we deserved to win the game. \u201cNobody gave us a cat in hell\u2019s chance of staying up three years ago. We\u2019ve got to be at our maximum. We\u2019ve got to invest well which is always the most difficult part. We\u2019ll get ready for the challenge. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a month before we start and then we\u2019ve got to look at budgets and how much it means to the club. Nobody said last year that Leicester would be champions, that Chelsea would be 10th and Liverpool eighth. It gives the smaller club a chance, because of the wealth that the smaller club gets.\u201d On Allam Bruce added: \u201cI\u2019ll dedicate it to the chairman. He was hell bent on a name change that unfortunately upset a lot of people. But really his four-year tenure is there for everyone to see. Thankfully the owner didn\u2019t want me to go [last year].\u201d",
