  "body": "Exciting times for Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister, who is really cutting through on the issue of Johnny Depp. Mr Depp is currently in the headlines owing to his reported split with his wife, Amber Heard, but you will recall he essentially shot to stardom last year when Heard brought the couple\u2019s dogs into Australia without a permit.   Related: Required reading for Johnny Depp: a short history of dogs in politics | Catherine Shoard    His nemesis in that drama was one Barnaby Joyce, deputy prime minister of Australia. Joyce seemed to regard himself as a master of sledging \u2013 it is, after all, the most Australian of artforms \u2013 and kicked off the farce by telling TV cameras that he had a message for \u201ca gentleman by the name of John Christopher Depp, 51 years old, AKA Jack Sparrow.\u201d I think I know this one: is that every time you shag his wife she gives you a biscuit? \u201cIt\u2019s time that Pistol and Boo buggered back off to the United States.\u201d Having pleaded guilty at a hearing into the matter last month, Depp and Heard were required by the terms of their settlement to make a video apology, which \u2013 despite apparently being scripted by the Australian authorities \u2013 came across as a work of radioactive sarcasm. \u201cAustralians are unique,\u201d Depp intoned, staring insolently into the camera, \u201cboth warm and direct.\u201d Whether Joyce understood what was happening in the video was unclear; his decision to question Depp\u2019s \u201cacting skills\u201d suggested the performance had gone some way over his head. \u201cLook,\u201d he reasoned on TV this week, \u201cMr Depp, Ms Heard, they just keep advertising our biosecurity requirements.\u201d Or, as Depp put it on a US chatshow: \u201cHe looks somehow inbred with a tomato. It\u2019s not a criticism, I\u2019m just saying, I was a little worried ... he might explode.\u201d           Johnny Depp and Barnaby Joyce revive feud    \u201cI think I\u2019m turning into Johnny Depp\u2019s Hannibal Lecter, aren\u2019t I?\u201d was Joyce\u2019s next gambit. \u201cI\u2019m inside his head, I\u2019m pulling little strings and little levers. Long after I\u2019ve forgotten about Mr Depp,\u201d he claimed, \u201che\u2019s remembering me.\u201d I can\u2019t decide which Mr Joyce has misunderstood more: the character notes of Hannibal Lecter, or the office of the deputy prime minister. After all, the defining thing about Hannibal Lecter isn\u2019t particularly that he gets inside your head, it\u2019s that he has you for breakfast. And that, for all Barnaby\u2019s attempts to gain the upper hand, appears to be what Johnny keeps doing to him.",
