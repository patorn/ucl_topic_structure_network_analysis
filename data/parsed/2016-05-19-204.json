  "body": "Zombie fans will soon be able to experience for themselves the fear and horror of The Walking Dead, as Universal Studios Hollywood has developed a new attraction based on the hit TV series.  Due to open on 4 July, the walk-through attraction has been created with the help of Los Angeles-based special effects studio KNB EFX, which is responsible for creating the gory, decaying zombies featured in the show. The Walking Dead tells the story of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by flesh-eating \u201cwalkers\u201d, which is how zombies are referred to in the show. Due to start its seventh season this year, the AMC show is the most watched in cable television history.          Making the Walking Dead attraction \u2013 video    Universal Studios worked with KNB EFX and the Walking Dead\u2019s creative team to develop animatronics, as well as prosthetics, moulds and fine details of the walkers. The attraction\u2019s set design and props will be recognisable to fans of the series, who will also encounter actors in makeup throughout their journey. The experience, which is being described as \u201cintense\u201d and is not recommended for under 13s, will be in a custom-built structure within the park. \u201cAfter six years of working on The Walking Dead, we have a great opportunity to take it out of the studio, off the soundstage and into an attraction where guests can come face-to-face with walkers,\u201d said the show\u2019s executive producer and director Greg Nicotero. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be able to make the attraction as authentic as possible. We\u2019re getting the chance to utilise moulds that were created specifically for the show and translate them into parts of the attraction. We\u2019re creating animatronic walkers that guests will be able to see \u2026 it\u2019s never been done before.\u201d  universalstudioshollywood.com",
