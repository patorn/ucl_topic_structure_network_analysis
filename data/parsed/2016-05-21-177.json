This week\u2019s question:  I\u2019m going to a first holy communion party for my eight-year-old niece in Ireland. I\u2019m told I have to put \u20ac50 in an envelope, and that some kids \u201cearn\u201d \u20ac1,000. I don\u2019t want to be seen as tightwad auntie, but must I do this? What do the kids do with all that money? Do you have a problem readers could solve?
