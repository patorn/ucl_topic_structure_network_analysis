  "body": "\u201cI intend to be buried here \u2026 in the 20th century!\u201d Joan Crawford carries off this line with magnificent hauteur in Nicholas Ray\u2019s extraordinary psychological western \u2013 and is there any other kind? This 1954 gem is on rerelease, starring Crawford as saloon-keeper Vienna, with a wonderful range of outfits, stark black eyes and a rectangular red slash of a mouth. Maria Callas herself couldn\u2019t have played Vienna with more poise, more defiance, more passionate abandon. Vienna presides over a surreally upmarket establishment in the middle of the old west, offering roulette, though no customer ever bets. Her office has a bust of Beethoven, and she plays the piano herself. Vienna is waiting for the fancy eastern clientele brought by the slowly advancing railroad, or more to the point, waiting for the railroad company to buy her out, strategically situated as her property is. An old lover, gunslinger Johnny \u201cGuitar\u201d Logan (Sterling Hayden) shows up one day on the promise of employment, at the same time as an angry mob of locals led by Emma Small (Mercedes McCambridge), suspecting Vienna of partaking in the illegal activities of her notorious customer Dancin\u2019 Kid (Scott Brady), who has been trifling with Emma\u2019s heart. Crawford appears like the disturbing figure in a nightmare \u2013 and everything looks as if it is happening in a vivid dream, aided by the fanatically intense but mannered dialogue, weird interiors and back projections: Johnny Guitar asks if he dreamt the bank robbery he saw happening under his nose. It\u2019s a fair question. Unforgettably strange and brilliant.         Watch clip from Johnny Guitar",
