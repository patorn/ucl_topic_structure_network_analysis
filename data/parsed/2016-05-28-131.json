  "body": "Half of teachers have been victims of social media abuse from pupils and their parents, the teaching union NASUWT said this week. According to a survey of 1,300 teachers carried out by the union, more than half of those who had suffered abuse said it had come from parents \u2013 an increase from 40% in 2015. NASUWT, which is representing teachers and pupils in the Reclaim the Internet campaign, added that too often online harassment of teachers is not dealt with effectively.
