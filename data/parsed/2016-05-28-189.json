  "body": "The television presenter James Mathison is running as an independent candidate against Tony Abbott in the federal seat of Warringah on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches, and says he does not know anyone \u201cunder 30, even under 40\u201d who feel Abbott represents their views. The 38-year-old, who has been absent from television in recent years but is best known for his six-year stint co-hosting Australian Idol, confirmed his candidacy on Friday and said he would target disenfranchised young voters who felt they had been let down by the two-party system. It comes three weeks after he was arrested for protesting against the removal of Moreton Bay fig trees from Anzac Parade, which were chopped down to make way for a light rail project.    130 years to grow. Destroyed in an hour. So sad. #savesydneystrees pic.twitter.com/poa4oQySDm\u2014 James Mathison (@jamesmathison) May 3, 2016    In an interview with MTV Australia, posted on Facebook, Mathison said his candidacy \u201cmade sense\u201d because the constituency was fed up with politicians and he was not a politician.   Related: Tony Abbott confirms he intends to stay in parliament and will recontest Warringah seat    He said Abbott\u2019s opposition to marriage equality and lukewarm views on climate change \u201cdon\u2019t only not reflect the views of people in Warringah but they don\u2019t reflect anyone I know, under 30, even under 40\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t have any political experience, but you know, if political experience means that you deceive the public and means that you break promises and means that you never say what you mean, then maybe we need someone who doesn\u2019t have \u2018political experience\u2019,\u201d Mathison said. \u201cMaybe we haven\u2019t got a chance, maybe we can\u2019t even make a dent in the party machine and people will laugh this off and think it\u2019s ridiculous but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, before going on to slightly misquote the lyrics of Rage Against the Machine\u2019s 1999 hit Guerilla Radio.  He also promised to trade in his sweatshirt and trucker cap for a shirt and jacket during the remaining five weeks of the campaign.  The independent Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie gave Mathison her endorsement. \u201cI love independents.\u201d Lambie said on Channel Nine\u2019s Today Show on Saturday. \u201cYou go for it, James. Put those budgie smugglers on and give Tony Abbott a run.\u201d Mathison\u2019s former Australian Idol co-host, Osher Gunsberg, also gave his support.

His primary vote in the 2013 federal election was more than 60%. His re-election campaign was launched with the help of the New South Wales premier, Mike Baird, who predicted that \u201cin years to come they will reflect on his [Abbott\u2019s] time as prime minister as an incredibly positive time for this country\u201d. Last month, Abbott said he did not think the Liberal party would return him as leader, despite his successor, Malcolm Turnbull, slipping in the polls, and said he envisioned his role now to be \u201can elder statesman\u201d.

Related: Tony Abbott says he does not think Liberals will make him leader again    \u201cSo I looked up online and in 2001 he was saying these things and I just thought, \u2018who is holding him to account?\u2019 No one, because it\u2019s a safe seat.\u201d He said his campaign would rely on social media, crowdfunding, and, interestingly, Uber. Mathison plans to sign up as a driver as a way to talk to voters. \u201cI am there for the electorate and if that means I\u2019m out at 4am, outside the Steyne, outside the Boatshed,I\u2019ll be there,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cIf I served kebabs instead of mints, imagine that?\u2019",
