  "body": "Hi Rick! What\u2019s it like to retire in your 20s (1) ? It\u2019s a bit weird. I hadn\u2019t had a proper job \u2013 I haven\u2019t had a normal life, really. And I\u2019m very grateful for that. The idea of stopping at 27 and saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that any more,\u201d was strange. There was a period of sitting around a lot doing bugger all, but very quickly I had a studio built. I was going to try and be a songwriter and producer for other people. Managers and A&R people would send singers round and I\u2019d think, \u201cThis person has got great hair, but they can\u2019t actually sing.\u201d Didn\u2019t you write One True Voice\u2019s second single, Shakespeare\u2019s (Way With) Words? (2) Yes, that\u2019s because Pete Waterman was doing it. He went, \u201cKID! Kid! You got a song?\u201d I said, \u201cI might do.\u201d I\u2019m still friends with the guy I wrote that with, and I still think our demo was better than what came out. Did you write the line \u201cI would write a sonnet, put your name upon it\u201d? I think I might have done, yes. [Laughs] There you go. It\u2019s different now: pop music\u2019s cool now. Ten or 15 years ago it wasn\u2019t. Pop songs were supposed to be corny. Did you enjoy doing interviews back in the day? I did quite like it. Certain questions trigger things in you. It\u2019s sometimes therapeutic \u2013 I\u2019ve done quite a lot of therapy anyway. What sort of therapy did you have? My wife met an American woman in the gym, got chatting, and at the end of the chat the woman said, \u201cI\u2019m actually a therapist.\u201d I ended up going to see her and it was amazing. She was a wise old American woman ... She might not actually have been a therapist at all, thinking about it. But it was really interesting, for a lot of reasons. My mum and dad divorced when I was four or five; I\u2019m the youngest of four. Before I was born, they\u2019d had a son die of meningitis. It was never really explained to us \u2013 but you know it\u2019s there. There\u2019s a shadow hanging over a family when something like that happens. And obviously I became a pop star and went through a lot of things that skewed my viewpoint on certain aspects of my life. How did various popstars from the 1980s take their tea (3)? I made tea for Bananarama, Dead or Alive, Mel and Kim and anyone else who was around. Most people are just builders\u2019 tea with a bit of milk, aren\u2019t they? There wasn\u2019t much herbal tea around in those days, that was a new-fangled thing. And coffee wasn\u2019t a big deal: it wasn\u2019t all this latte or cappuccino business. There wasn\u2019t anywhere to buy all that. It was unheard of. We need to discuss Ruddy Big Pig (4). What were the lyrics again? \u201cA ruddy big pig came down our street, my mum said, \u2018Get it for something to eat.\u2019 We had it for tea with apple pie, all mixed up with a dog.\u201d I think that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know why the dog\u2019s in it. The big question is: what was the song\u2019s melody? There wasn\u2019t exactly a melody. It was more like poetry. I\u2019m trying to remember it. Tell you what, I\u2019ll record it, put in on YouTube and send you the link, how about that? I think I know where this is going. I\u2019ve never properly rickrolled anyone! But I have been rickrolled. Actually, I did do a physical rickroll once: the Cartoon Network invited me to rickroll the whole of America. I was on a float at the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, this massive televised event in New York. Snoopy behind me, Spongebob ahead of me \u2013 it was like the Blackpool Illuminations on acid. It was pretty amazing. They paid me a lot of money to do it, if I\u2019m honest. Other than that, have you really only made $12 from rickrolling? No, I think that\u2019s just something Pete said when he was having a bit of a thing about earning music from the internet and blah blah blah. Some artists would probably see themselves as unlucky for that to happen, but I feel lucky, because one way or another that song has had a bit of a rebirth. People who weren\u2019t even alive in the 80s know it. Some of them even love it. Some people might be surprised that your new album (5) contains a song, This Old House, which is basically an acid house track. Well, sort of. The lyrical content is quite literal \u2013 we moved a few years ago and we redid the house from top to bottom, and it felt like the process of making the record and redoing the old house went hand in hand. Also, my wife and I have been together for years, but only got married three years ago. It felt like a real chapter in my life. So, there\u2019s the old house, but then there\u2019s old house music, too, so it made sense. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be a single \u2013 it\u2019s a bit too in-your-face. You should get Disclosure to remix it, for some Radio 1 appeal! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get on Radio 1 any more; I feel like Radio 2 is more my home now. But if Disclosure did a remix I might stand a chance. I\u2019ll have a word! Footnotes 1) Rick retired in 1993, a year after the birth of his daughter. His first two albums each hit platinum status; his fourth didn\u2019t chart. 2) The second single by Pete Waterman\u2019s Popstars: The Rivals boyband got to No 10. Rick also wrote a song for Fish out of Marillion. 3) Rick started off as the drummer in a band called FBI; after he became the singer Pete Waterman spotted him and employed him as a teaboy. 4) In the 80s, Rick made the mistake of telling Smash Hits that his first composition, as a child, had been about a large hog. 5) 50 is out next month. Rick is 50 years old. \u2022 50 is released on 10 June on BMG",
