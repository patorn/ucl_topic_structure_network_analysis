  "body": "Pep Guardiola said he had given his life to Bayern Munich over the past three years and refused to accept the inability to deliver the Champions League meant he had failed in his mission at the German club. For the third season in succession, Guardiola lost at the semi-final stage of Europe\u2019s elite competition \u2013 on this occasion, to Diego Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Bayern won 2-1 on the night but it was not enough to avoid an away goals exit and Simeone paid tribute to them as the best team he had ever faced. \u201cIt was particularly so in the first half,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cIt was unbelievable how they played. It was great to see such intensity. I was literally in love with this game. But we soaked up the pressure and we won the game. We coped with the pressure that they put on us. It\u2019s just unbelievable what we have achieved. We have beaten two of the strongest teams in Europe \u2013 first Barcelona in the quarter-final and now Bayern.\u201d Guardiola\u2019s disappointment was a pronounced feature of a tumultuous match and it was inevitable he would be asked to justify the lack of Champions League progress. Domestic dominance is one thing but Bayern have craved a sixth European Cup. Guardiola\u2019s response was defiant.

We have tried our best but it hasn\u2019t worked out. In terms of my period here, it\u2019s up to you what you want to think. \u201cI think I have helped the players here. I am very satisfied with the performances. Maybe it wasn\u2019t enough but in the end, I am satisfied with everything that has happened here. Everything is good. I have done my best. The players know that. \u201cI have given my life for this club, from the first minute to the last and we played well tonight. Maybe we played not so well at other times. I am very proud. It was a real honour to train these players. I have really enjoyed it here and I am sure the future at Bayern Munich is perfect with these players.\u201d Guardiola refused to blame Thomas M\u00fcller for the 34th-minute penalty miss that would have put Bayern 2-0 up on the night and, instead, he painted a bigger picture. \u201cTitles are just numbers, statistics,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to reach the Champions League final here and I didn\u2019t achieve it but it doesn\u2019t change my opinion about the way I have performed. Yes, we are sad now and we want to go to Ingolstadt [on Saturday] to secure the Bundesliga title.

No. You are disappointed when you don\u2019t play well. It\u2019s a Champions League semi-final. It was the same when I was at Barcelona and we lost to Chelsea [in 2012]. We tried our best to score that night but we didn\u2019t get through. \u201cAtl\u00e9tico were very defensive. We played to win and we did that. We didn\u2019t score a goal in Madrid and that was the difference. We could have scored three or four tonight. My idea is to attack and go forward. The most important thing is this club has a great future, with great players and a great mentality. I just wish the best for the future at this club and I hope Carlo Ancelotti [the incoming manager] can keep the same level going.\u201d",
