  "body": "Ukraine\u2019s president has appointed a former Nato secretary general as a special adviser, drawing a derisive reaction from Russia. Petro Poroshenko announced the appointment of Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former prime minister of Denmark who was Nato secretary general from 2009 to 2014, on Friday. MPs in Russia, which has viewed Nato\u2019s eastward expansion as a security threat, were quick to speak out against the appointment. \u201cThis is of course in large part a gesture, but it\u2019s a gesture that will be backed up by actions. And it\u2019s a hostile gesture,\u201d Leonid Kalashnikov, deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, told Interfax.   Related: Mikheil Saakashvili: 'Ukraine's government has no vision for reform'    Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, called Rasmussen\u2019s appointment a \u201costentatious show\u201d with no \u201cmilitary or even practical purpose\u201d. He likened it to Ukraine\u2019s appointment of the former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is now governor of Odessa, and other foreigners. \u201cAll this buffoonery serves one goal: to keep Ukraine in the centre of attention with its western partners at any cost,\u201d Kosachyov said. \u201cBecause if this attention weakens, and they suggest that Ukraine engage in solving its own problems and no longer blame Russia or the \u2018difficult legacy of the past\u2019, it will be like death for the Kiev regime.\u201d Kosachyov added that it \u201cisn\u2019t pleasing\u201d that Kiev would consult such an anti-Russian figure as Rasmussen.  On Saturday Poroshenko shared on Facebook an article quoting Kosachyov that was headlined \u201cRussia isn\u2019t pleased with the appointment of Rasmussen as Poroshenko\u2019s adviser\u201d. On Thursday G7 leaders at a summit in Japan said sanctions against Russia would not be lifted until it fully implemented the Minsk peace plan for eastern Ukraine. On Friday Vladimir Putin said Russia could target Romania and Poland for hosting US-led Nato missile defence bases. \u201cIf yesterday in those areas of Romania people simply did not know what it means to be in the crosshairs, then today we will be forced to carry out certain measures to ensure our security,\u201d Putin said at a news conference in Athens with the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. It is not clear what Rasmussen will focus on in his new position. He said in a Facebook post that he would do his \u201cutmost to promote security and reforms in Ukraine\u201d, including in the fight against corruption. He also called the security situation in eastern Ukraine, where a ceasefire with Russia-backed separatists has been frequently violated, \u201calarming\u201d. More than 9,300 people have been killed since the conflict began in 2014. Rasmussen\u2019s appointment in Ukraine and the Russian reaction comes days after the two countries cooperated on a high-profile prisoner exchange. Putin pardoned a Ukrainian pilot, Nadiya Savchenko, while Poroshenko pardoned two Russian soldiers captured in eastern Ukraine.",
