  "body": "Eurovision ground down a tiny notch back to relative sanity last night, which is only to say it was still as sweetly mad as a fish in a sporran. In Stockholm\u2019s Globe arena, and in a remarkable break from recent tradition, some of the music wasn\u2019t bad. None of it was actually good. But Sweden put on a terrific show, at one stage featuring the hosts, the remarkably funny Petra Mede and M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, doing such a horribly knowing song-and-dance about the whole thing that you began to fear that this was the very moment irony began to eat itself. But there was still gentle, old-fashioned irony to be had. Chiefly of course, for viewers, courtesy of Graham Norton. \u201cOver the past few years, via the semi-finals, a lot of the dross has been filtered out. Not tonight, ladies and gentlemen! A couple of corkers have made it through the net\u2026\u201d His inheritance of the Wogan mantle is complete, but there are fresher thorns here, as should be the way. Of the German entry he had this to say. \u201cJamie-Lee. There isn\u2019t a single thing about this woman that doesn\u2019t annoy me.\u201d Ms Lee wore earmuffs and a babydoll dress and had lasers coming from her trees. Long sigh from Graham. \u201cThey, Germany, obviously had long, long meetings about this promo and approved it.\u201d I\u2019m paraphrasing but only slightly. Ukraine won, with a well-meant dirge about a murdered grandmother. There may have been some Russia-hating in play. Australia or Sweden should have won, but don\u2019t at the moment enjoy such interestingly divisive politics.           Eurovision winner Jamala says her song touches people    So to the songs. Slow Down (Dutch) went on for ever. My notes say, wittily, Speed The [naughty word] Up. Azerbaijan: Miracle. It was going to take one. I loved the spirited entry from Israel, and also Hungary (\u201cyour enemy might be your own mind; be proud you were born to be real\u201d arrived the lyrics, but in a fit of genius they and their spinning drum-monk managed also to cram in \u201cyou\u2019ve been weird, a mess; they don\u2019t know how to value uniqueness\u201d.) And Sweden\u2019s own song, If I Were Sorry, at least managed to demonstrate a mastery of gerunds, and probably, actually, should have won. Dami Im from Australia hit the high notes in a way that would moisten the nethers of any The Voice audience. Cyprus had bald men hitting the low notes with some cage-fighting rock. Sample lyrics: \u201cCaught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise.\u201d And the what what? Nina from Croatia sang a song entitled Lighthouse. Norton\u2019s murmured commentary informed us that she \u201cmay have lost some weight since she bought this dress\u201d and I thought it an oddly coy remark, but then the \u2026 dear god! She\u2019s dressed as a huge \u2026 Jedi/Yeti Lighthouse! About 12ft high! For the first immemorable verse at least, then the kit came off to reveal a nice enough young silver-haired lass whose only fault was to allow herself to have been too encouraged to \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d. Russia\u2019s Sergey, we were informed, has spoken out against the homophobic laws, even mentioned Ukraine. He also runs a bakery, making cakes for dogs \u2013 called, naturally, Poodle Strudel. Mr Putin must want to put him on posters and jail him simultaneously, far from the first time in that country\u2019s history. Joe and Jake, the UK entry, was nicely derivative and didn\u2019t quite manage a pimple on the voting figures. Despite Mr Norton\u2019s prompting \u2013 \u201cgood luck Joe and Jake, this is it!\u201d \u2013 he was doing the \u201ccan leave with their heads held high,\u201d afterwards for You\u2019re Not Alone, and they didn\u2019t get a single point in the popular vote. If you thought we woz robbed, convinced a nefarious and unwarranted plot against us was all that stood between JJ and garlands, you\u2019re delightfully entitled to your opinion. And, as Mr Norton pointed out, it was rather cruel, this new voting system.",
