  "body": "The BBC fears it is fighting a losing battle with the government over a proposal to appoint more than half of a revamped board at the helm of the broadcaster, which it believes amounts to an attack on its editorial independence. A white paper to be published on Thursday is expected to call for an end to the BBC\u2019s historic self-governance and replace it with a 13-strong unitary board with more than seven roles filled by government appointees.   Related: BBC charter renewal: the main sticking points     When taken with other measures expected in the white paper, BBC executives believe the government will be able to exert too much influence over a broadcaster which is meant to be politically independent. Critics have said it will effectively turn the BBC into a state broadcaster. There are also anxieties about proposals to give greater power to the parliamentary spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, to conduct investigations into the corporation\u2019s affairs. The BBC believes this could allow an examination of editorial matters such as whether Saturday night TV is value for money. The NAO rejects this suggestion. An independent report by David Clementi commissioned by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport backed the creation of a single executive board to replace a two-tier system in which the government appoints the chair and vice chair. It would run the BBC along the lines of a traditional corporation, with a far closer relationship with the broadcaster\u2019s editorial decision making.

It must be opposed | Phil Harding    That would pave the way for the abolition of the BBC Trust, which regulates the broadcaster, handing most of those functions to Ofcom, the communications regulator. Headed by Rona Fairhead, the trust is expected to be be wound up at the end of this year when the BBC\u2019s current royal charter expires. A day after directors and stars spoke up for the corporation\u2019s independence at the Bafta TV awards, a cross-party group of peers leading a campaign to halt controversial government cuts to the BBC said they would launch a private member\u2019s bill challenging what are expected to be key tenets of the plans for the BBC being drawn up by the culture secretary, John Whittingdale.

Backed by actors Richard Wilson and Ross Kemp and TV presenter June Sarpong, Lord Lester said supporters of the BBC would take to the streets in protest if their concerns over the BBC were not met.  \u201cIf the government gives way on these issues, I will withdraw the bill,\u201d said the Lib Dem peer. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t do it, my goodness me, not only are we going to back the bill but we will march, so there we are.\u201d Wilson, the former star of BBC1\u2019s One Foot in the Grave, said: \u201cI hope the government will be forced into one of their many U-turns \u2013 they are very good at them these days. I don\u2019t think they realise how strong the public feeling is for the BBC. I would march in the streets, I would, as long as they don\u2019t march too far.\u201d Traditionally, the white paper, the outcome of a negotiation between the DCMS and the BBC, is not put to a Commons vote and there is mounting concern that changes will not be debated by parliament. On Monday, peers argued that the future of the BBC should not rest on the whim of the government.    Related: Peter Kosminsky's Baftas speech backing the BBC \u2013 full text    Following reports over the weekend about the plans, the shadow culture secretary, Maria Eagle, accused the culture secretary of being \u201cdetermined to diminish the BBC\u201d. Eagle said: \u201cProposals to further top-slice the licence fee and pack a new governing board with Tory appointees would be a real hammer blow to the independence of the BBC and be more evidence of mendacious meddling on the part of the secretary of state. Labour will oppose them all the way. The white paper is expected to confirm  that the BBC will be forced to share some of the licence fee with rival producers of content such as childrens\u2019 television. On Sunday, at the Bafta awards, Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky delivered a speech which provoked a standing ovation by the audience of TV stars and industry executives.  He said the BBC was a \u201cpublic broadcaster \u2013 independent of government \u2013 not a state broadcaster, where the people who make the editorial decisions are appointed by the government \u2013 like they do in those bastions of democracy: Russia or North Korea.\u201d",
