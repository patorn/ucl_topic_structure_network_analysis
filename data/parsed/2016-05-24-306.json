  "body": "Almost everyone who gives the matter serious thought agrees that George Osborne and David Cameron want to reshape Britain. The spending cuts, the upending of the NHS, even this month\u2019s near-miss over the BBC: signs lie everywhere of how this will be a decade, maybe more, of massive change. Yet even now it is little understood just how far Britain might shift \u2013 and in which direction. Take austerity, the word that will define this government. Even its most astute critics commit two basic errors. The first is to assume that it boils down to spending cuts and tax rises. The second is to believe that all this is meant to reduce how much the country is borrowing. What such commonplaces do is reduce austerity to a technical, reversible project. Were it really so simple all we would need to do is turn the spending taps back on and wash away all traces of Osbornomics.   Related: Privatisation isn't working. It's time for a public service users bill | Cat Hobbs    Austerity is far bigger than that: it is a project irreversibly to transfer wealth from the poorest to the richest. It\u2019s doing the job very nicely: while the typical British worker is still earning less after inflation than he or she was before the banking crash, the number of UK-based billionaires has nearly quadrupled since 2009. Even while he slashes benefits, Osborne is deep into a programme to hand over much of what is still owned by the British public to the wealthiest. Privatisation is the multibillion-pound centrepiece of Osborne\u2019s austerity \u2013 yet it rarely gets a mention from either politicians or press. The Queen mentioned it in her speech last week, but the headline writers ignored it. And if you don\u2019t know that this Thursday is the closing date for consultation on the sale of the Land Registry, our public record of who owns what property, that\u2019s hardly your fault \u2013 I haven\u2019t spotted it in the papers, either. But without getting rid of prize assets, Osborne\u2019s austerity programme falls apart. At a time when tax revenues are more weak stream than healthy flood, those sales bring much-needed cash into the Treasury and make his sums add up. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has ruled that the only reason the chancellor met his debts target last year was because he flogged off our public assets. And what a fire sale that was, with everything from our last remaining stake in the Royal Mail to shares in Eurostar shoved out the door in the biggest wave of privatisations of any year in British history. And more, much more, is to come. The all new and mostly grotesque housing bill will force local authorities to sell \u201chigh-value\u201d council houses once a family moves out \u2013 which will basically hand over whatever remains of social housing in central London to investors. Osborne also wants local authorities \u201cto dispose of potentially surplus assets\u201d, of which he calculates they have \u00a360bn \u201cin property not used for schools or housing\u201d. That would be property such as our public libraries and swimming pools \u2013 but to a government hellbent on asset-stripping such communal necessities are merely unsold inventory. At Whitehall, ministers plan to sell a big chunk of Channel 4, and the public stake in the national air traffic control. And that\u2019s just the start, because here\u2019s something else you probably won\u2019t have read about: Osborne has bundled up all of our public holdings \u2013 in every company from the collapsed banks to the Royal Mint \u2013 and put them under the control of a government organisation called UK Government Investments. Its CEO (what else?) is a former doyen of the City called Mark Russell. In a rare interview in 2013, Russell declared: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe government makes for a particularly good shareholder. Our belief is that unless there is a good policy reason for government to have a shareholding then really we should be seeking to divest those shareholdings.\u201d Everything must go is no longer the cry of distressed shopkeepers \u2013 it is now public policy.   Related: Why do the Tories want to hide who owns our country\u2019s land? | Charles Arthur    As an employee of the taxpayer, Russell earns up to \u00a3159,999, which is far more than the prime minister\u2019s salary. Yet the one thing he has done that you will have heard of was an unmitigated disaster. He was among those in charge of selling 70% of Royal Mail three years ago \u2013 a sale that, even the government now admits, brought in less money than it should. We let a 500-year-old public service go at a \u00a31bn discount, a select committee of MPs calculated in 2014. And that takes us to the heart of the problem with such sales. At best, privatisation is a short-term gain for a long-term loss. The public sells one of its prize assets in order to enable the chancellor to bank some cash immediately. In a report published on Monday, the campaign group We Own It calculates that if Osborne sells the Land Registry, National Air Traffic Services, Channel 4 and the Ordnance Survey the public will kiss goodbye to control over \u00a37.7bn in dividends and profits in the next 50 years. Sure, we pocket a couple of billion now \u2013 but we lose far more in the long run. These are services that have taken many decades, even centuries, of public investment and management to build up. The Land Registry dates back to Victorian times; the Ordnance Survey\u2019s aerial photographs of enemy territory helped Britain win the first world war. All that accumulated effort and ingenuity will be handed over to a small group of investors \u2013 and for what? Better management? A recent study of the evidence by the University of Greenwich concludes there is \u201cno significant difference in efficiency between public and privately owned companies in public services\u201d. For more investment? Ministers selling off everything from railways to water have promised privatisation will bring greater investment. It comes \u2013 but it\u2019s always the public that ends up paying for it. Thatcher claimed that selling off BT, British Gas and the rest would turn Britain into a shareholder democracy. Official figures show that Britons now own less than half as much of the UK stock market as they did before Thatcher\u2019s first privatisation. Osborne\u2019s privatisation, like the rest of his austerity programme, will enable him to transfer wealth from the public to a far smaller group of private investors. The employees can look forward to cuts in jobs, pay and conditions \u2013 as we have seen across the privatised utilities. The rest of us, the customers, will endure higher bills and paying for hidden subsidies. And the chancellor? He will have brought in enough cash to enable him to make some pre-election tax cuts \u2013 to literally buy himself votes. Osborne calls this privatisation. I treat it as part and parcel of austerity. But there is another term you and I might use. Because this making off with our public property is nothing more than legalised larceny.",
