  "body": "In 1971 the bestselling single in Britain was \u201cChirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep\u201d by Middle of the Road. I think it\u2019s safe to say this isn\u2019t the reason David Hepworth claims the year to be a high-water mark for rock \u2013 we are almost 200 pages into his book before he\u00a0even mentions (and instantly dismisses) the \u201ctawdry chaos of the British singles chart\u201d \u2013 though this was\u00a0virtually all that the average Briton\u00a0would have heard on the radio. Never a\u00a0Dull Moment barely references singles because Hepworth himself wasn\u2019t paying any attention to them in\u00a01971: he was 21 years old, and learning about contemporary music from the pages of Rolling Stone magazine and the small-print credits on the sleeves of albums in Harum Records in\u00a0north London. Singles were for kids. Albums were for aspirational, inquiring 21-year-olds, and 1971 saw the release of a bunch of albums that came to define classic rock: Led Zeppelin IV, the Who\u2019s Who\u2019s Next, Jethro Tull\u2019s Aqualung, the Doors\u2019 LA\u00a0Woman and Carole King\u2019s Tapestry. Hepworth writes about the music, and the music scene, as he remembers it \u2013 and it is something he\u00a0has clearly been mulling over for years, mentioning several times that the passage of time only enhances the\u00a0power of early 70s rock. He feels confident enough to claim that the Who\u2019s \u201cBaba O\u2019Reilly\u201d was really \u201cthe\u00a0best recording of the best year in\u00a0the history of recording\u201d. With Never a Dull Moment, he has decided to stop worrying and revel in the notion that he might well be right. His lack of objectivity doesn\u2019t make the book any less of a treat to read, as\u00a0Hepworth marries his innocent teenage joy with four decades as a pop critic \u2013 frequently an acerbic one. He wistfully recalls the \u201clast summer of the\u00a0folk club, when you could still find extraordinary talent, talent apparently without precedent, growing wild by the road side\u201d. It was the best of times because \u201cit seemed to be the first of times\u201d. Hepworth\u2019s \u201capparently\u201d and \u201cseemed to be\u201d are the key words there; just out of his teens, he was naive, but knew enough to convince himself that this was a year without precedent. Everything afterwards would gradually seem a little less fresh. That\u2019s quite natural. Throughout the book are anecdotes that indicate the album-based rock he\u00a0loved was becoming over-ripe just as it peaked, its stars having all the gravitas of spoilt children. George Harrison was confused as to why the UK government refused to waive purchase tax on his million-selling Bangladesh charity album \u2013 after all, a\u00a0Beatle had asked them to. Neil Young prevented both himself and the Oscar-nominated actor\u00a0Carrie Snodgress, who\u00a0he was dating, from attending the ceremony by refusing to\u00a0wear a tuxedo. And such hippies as Crosby, Stills and\u00a0Nash and Joni Mitchell would turn\u00a0up at their manager David Geffen\u2019s office just to hear him screaming down the phone in\u00a0order to raise their fees, something they were presumably too\u00a0fragile to do\u00a0for themselves. There are plenty of\u00a0mildly astonishing facts \u2013 I\u00a0didn\u2019t know that Paul Griffin, who added inscrutable but essential piano parts to\u00a0Dionne Warwick\u2019s \u201cWalk\u00a0On By\u201d and\u00a0Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cLike a\u00a0Rolling Stone\u201d,\u00a0was the\u00a0man who stopped Don\u00a0McLean\u2019s \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d from collapsing under the weight of its riddle-me-this conceits with his bar\u2011room piano accompaniment.            Never a Dull Moment rarely dips into backwaters, only mentioning groups such as Caravan, Van der Graaf Generator and even Genesis and Free in passing. Neither is there much deviation from the mindset of the day.\u00a0Hepworth admits he was untroubled by sexism when he was 21 \u2013 it simply didn\u2019t come up in conversation \u2013 and so the enthusiasm he felt for certain artists still overrides some difficult issues. Lou Reed\u2019s first wife, Bettye Kronstad, is dismissed as a\u00a0\u201cformer cocktail waitress\u201d rather than getting credit for helping to rebuild his career after the Velvet Underground fell apart (she was also a\u00a0student at Columbia University when\u00a0they met \u2013 citing her part-time job seems rather mean). Inhabiting the\u00a0mood of the day is part of the point of the exercise, but it is occasionally jarring, and exclusionary. If \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d signalled that pop had lost its innocence, and pined for the day before Buddy Holly died, Marc Bolan looked to the future by taking a\u00a0more positive stance, channelling the energy of the 1950s (he often repurposed Chuck Berry riffs), adding his tower-block Tolkien lyrics (\u201cYou\u2019ve got a hubcap diamond star halo / You\u2019re built like a car, oh yeah\u201d) and making something that felt brand new. This sound would go on to define 1972 and 1973, birthing glam rock, and it has no\u00a0part in Hepworth\u2019s story. When he deals with the non-binary sound of T\u00a0Rex, he becomes rather catty. \u201cBolan was not one for digging out a valuable away point,\u201d he says of the singer\u2019s tendency to expect instant success (and nobody was more successful in 1971). He describes their poor reception at the largely forgotten Weeley festival as evidence that Bolan\u2019s voice was \u201cclearly inadequate\u201d and T Rex as a\u00a0band were \u201cinsubstantial\u201d, as if this overrode the 10 weeks they spent at No\u00a01 with \u201cHot Love\u201d and the deathless \u201cGet It On\u201d. Yet as \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d was saved by\u00a0its cheeky piano frills, so Hepworth gets out of a hole with smart self-awareness; when he mentions the \u201cdivides between rock fans and real people\u201d, you forgive him. \u2022 Bob Stanley\u2019s Yeah!
