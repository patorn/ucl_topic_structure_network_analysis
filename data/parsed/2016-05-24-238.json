  "body": "Vegetarians are now relatively well catered for in the UK, but if you want to avoid animal products such as eggs and dairy altogether, it\u2019s tougher to find a restaurant to meet your needs. There are lots of great places if you\u2019re open to those that are not exclusively vegan, but it pays to have some careful questions handy.  Go for a curry India is the centre of the veggie universe. This is no surprise: 40% of the population lives meat-free. No other cuisine matches the subcontinent\u2019s scale and variety of vegetarian cookery, and while it\u2019s not all suitable for vegans, a good deal of it is. The food of south India is lighter and fiercer than the north, with hot-sour sambar (lentil stew) and spicy coconut chutney served as addictive embellishments to many dishes. Dosa (rice and lentil crepes) are hugely popular southern staples, and their close cousins, uttapham, are covered in myriad toppings like pizzas.

And just about every high-street curry house will have several vegetarian options. Often, the best are listed as sides rather than main courses. Mixing and matching a handful of these is a tasty and more authentic way to eat than a single plate of food. Hindus don\u2019t consider eggs vegetarian, so they are rarely found on menus, but dairy is another story. Many dishes are enriched with curd (yoghurt) or ghee (clarified butter) \u2013 so ask. Check that your chapati hasn\u2019t been brushed with butter, and skip the naan bread, which often has yoghurt or buttermilk in the dough. Take a tour of south-east Asia The super-spicy near-neighbours of India also boast some of the finest meat-free dishes around. Indonesian cuisine has tempeh, a nutritional powerhouse and close relative of tofu. It\u2019s made with whole rather than ground soybeans, which are pressed and fermented. Look out for it deep-fried into crisp chips, which are traditionally dipped in chilli-spiked sauces. Much south-east Asian food is knee-deep in greenery but vegans will need to keep a watchful eye out for shrimp paste and fish sauce, which give many dishes their umami hit. In Thai restaurants, you can ask for vegetable curries to be prepared with the fragrant massaman pastes of the far south, which omit shellfish \u2013 and you will find lots of tofu and vegetable curries, vegetarian versions of pad thai (stir-fried rice noodles with veg or meat) and tom yum soups \u2013 as well as the many excellent and delicious Thai salads (fish sauce, which is often used for salty flavour, can be replaced with soy sauce). You do need to look out for unannounced eggs, which are often scrambled into dishes or used in the production of noodles. It\u2019s fine to ask if you can have rice noodles which are vegan and commonplace in south-east Asian kitchens. In Chinese restaurants, they are known as ho fun and may be listed on the menu. Ask them to hold the cheese in your local Italian     Puglian pasta shapes like orecchiette are usually made without eggs. Photograph: \u00a9Daniela White Images/Getty Images/Moment Open    Did you know that Italy has the highest percentage of vegetarians in Europe? It certainly has a rich culinary tradition of cooking without meat. It\u2019s not always easy to find a wide choice of strictly vegan dishes in an Italian restaurant, but it\u2019s a myth that all pasta or risotto dishes are cheesy, buttery affairs. Now that the regional diversity of Italian food is celebrated in many of the UK\u2019s restaurants, it\u2019s getting easier. A restaurant carrying specialties from southern Italian regions will offer the most choice. Olive oil rather than cheese will season many pasta dishes. Rich, toothsome Puglian pasta shapes like orecchiette are usually made without eggs \u2013 and dried pasta, made from durum wheat, is always vegan.  Go cold turkey With British restaurants falling over themselves to talk you into ordering several small sharing plates, you could do a lot worse than going to the spiritual home of this style of eating. A spread of Turkish mezze dishes can be as nourishing as it is delicious. Match a pulse dish like hummus with kisir (wheat, chopped herbs and walnuts) and you\u2019re packing some serious protein. Delicious falafel has found its way into many southern European kitchens too. Smoky aubergine baba ganoush, stuffed vine leaves and many other dishes are vegan-friendly, with tahini paste used to give creamy nutty richness. Baklava, Turkey\u2019s national dessert, is often made with syrup rather than honey, and traditional Turkish delight is also vegan (although it\u2019s always worth checking).   Related: What's the attitude to vegan food where you live?    Go for a really posh meal Some of the country\u2019s top-end restaurants, while not being nominally veggie, run tasting menus designed for a whole table of herbivores (contact the restaurants in advance for sample menus). Some of them also offer vegan tasting menus, while others will adapt with a little notice. London\u2019s Pied a Terre, Gauthier Soho, Edinburgh\u2019s The Kitchin have all achieved critical acclaim for their offerings. This is an exciting development in a sector of the restaurant world that has historically been suspicious of so-called dietary requirements.
