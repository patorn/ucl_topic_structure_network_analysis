  "body": "Originally published in Eight By Eight magazine  Down in the concrete guts of Yankee Stadium, a little after 3pm on a jewel-cut January Wednesday, Patrick Vieira sits down for an interview with ESPN\u2019s Shaka Hislop. Vieira\u2019s in hour seven of what\u2019ll end (this evening, in a midtown bar) as a 13-hour press day introducing him as new manager of New York City Football Club. Hour seven, so far, looks a lot like hour six: Vieira slowly orbiting the empty pine boxes of the visitor\u2019s locker room, answering for an alphabet of TV networks the same few questions he\u2019s already answered in hour four\u2019s press conference and hour five\u2019s radio interviews. How will your NYCFC play? Who are your managerial idols? Are you worried about the MLS? What brought you to New York?    Related: Would Zlatan Ibrahimovic ever choose Philadelphia Union over LA Galaxy?    In general, Vieira\u2019s handling all of this \u2013 and the press-side screw-ups, like the photographer who asks him to spend 10 minutes posing for a shot she has irredeemably mislit \u2013 with levels of patience you\u2019d associate with an animated grandmother rather than a new manager expected to lift a 17th-place side to approximately first. But he\u2019s visibly glad to see Hislop, who was, in 2006, one of the first well-known players to make the move from Europe to Major League Soccer that Vieira\u2019s now attempting as manager. Before that, the pair played against each other in the Premier League\u2019s middle decade, when Vieira was the world\u2019s best central midfielder. They laugh all the way through the mic check. On camera, Vieira tells Hislop he\u2019ll have \u201cno excuses\u201d in his first senior managerial appointment, that he\u2019s attracted to the NYCFC \u201cproject,\u201d and that he wants the team to \u201cplay to win games.\u201d Off camera, he tells Hislop that he\u2019s well, that his family\u2019s enjoying the city, and that they should all get together when he\u2019s back in town. It\u2019s perfect sitcom New York: two old campaigners meeting accidentally, still handsome and proud, trading phone numbers here in the center of the universe. Except \u2013 Vieira isn\u2019t sure. Shaka knows the UK number \u2013 no, disconnected, Vieira has an American phone, definitely, yes, it\u2019s activated, he\u2019s waving it around hopefully. In the end NYCFC\u2019s media director has to step in. Vieira\u2019s moved so recently he doesn\u2019t know his own phone number. It\u2019s the only time all day we see how far he\u2019s come to be here \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t seem to trouble him. At the end of the day, Vieira tells me, \u201cI think football reflects our society. Our society changes. The evolution of society dictates the evolution of the game.\u201d He says this with the confident wonder of every new New Yorker, sitting on a folding chair with a baseball-themed rug stretching out beneath him. NYCFC has played one season of football, in which it conceded a league-worst 58 goals.  Vieira\u2019s stated aspirations as manager of NYCFC are \u201cto be the best that I can.\u201d Keep in mind, though, that he\u2019s a World Cup winner, that he\u2019s captained an undefeated Premier League season, and that this appointment is something like a three-year audition for the manager\u2019s role at Manchester City \u2013 one of the biggest jobs in football. Manchester City is NYCFC\u2019s big brother, Vieira\u2019s just come from a successful two-year tenure coaching their Under-21s, and their executives have been forthright about hoping Vieira will return to England. When Vieira says \u201cthe best I can,\u201d everyone knows he means the best, full stop. The usual rules of football are that Patrick Vieira stays in Europe. Football\u2019s \u201cbests\u201d live there, after all: best players, best leagues, best managers. In the United States, football matches are still played in baseball stadiums. NYCFC holds home games (as well as interviews) at Yankee Stadium, and it\u2019s awkward for everyone. Baseball is played on a blistered diamond with a red scab of infield, and NYCFC\u2019s pitch has to be laid down on top of both shapes, with one goal in left field and the other by the first-base dugout. The conversion takes three days, in each direction, and early in the NYCFC-Yankees partnership, Yankee infielders could be quoted muttering darkly about possible \u201cdivots\u201d and unpredictable grounders. But at least the five boroughs have a football club. Football-wise, the US is defined by exactly this type of effortful incrementalism \u2013 grand plans to reach a semi-final, to nationalize some Champions League contributors, and find a way to screw things up a little less for players between 15 and 21. American footballing bests are snark superlatives: \u201cbest salary-capped league,\u201d \u201cbest bargain goalkeepers,\u201d or \u201cbest place for weary Euro-stars to build their brand before retiring.\u201d All the way back to the New York Cosmos, the Big Apple\u2019s been a place to end a career, not to begin one \u2013 so why is Vieira starting here? It\u2019s a hard question. What we want from sports are stories about souls \u2013 about humans and trials and virtues. Vieira is brave and talented; Vieira succeeds or Vieira fails; in the end we learn something about Vieira. That\u2019s true, more or less, and also it\u2019s comforting\u2014it suggests that everyone deserves the life they get. But: society changes. Vieira\u2019s moving to New York in 2016, and in 2016 souls just don\u2019t cut it anymore. There\u2019s no number of souls that explain why NYCFC play in a baseball stadium or why Vieira\u2019s coaching in New York. You need money to answer these questions: NYCFC plays in Yankee Stadium because building a new stadium in a metropolis is unbelievably difficult and expensive, and Patrick Vieira\u2019s coaching in America because football has a money problem that it doesn\u2019t quite know how to solve. The money in question is that of NYCFC\u2019s majority owner \u2013 City Football Group, a holding company controlled by Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour. Since 2008, CFG has invested something like $2bn in football \u2013 founding NYCFC, buying other clubs, but mostly turning Manchester City from a noble old goof into a regular Premier and Champions League contender. The plan, seemingly, is to build a family of dominant clubs on several continents and then profit as football becomes an even more lucrative global media property. Generally, CFG is the smartest and cuddliest of the recent wave of football investment \u2013 in Manchester, it has spent heavily on youth and technical infrastructure, and while CFG has missed or overspent on some transfers, Manchester City have mostly satisfied their initial ambition of having two world-class players in every position. CFG clubs have likable players, progressive football, and obvious care for their local communities. They\u2019re the sort of club that sells shirts in Portland and turns on televisions in Beijing. Things are working out to the point that when NYCFC sporting director Claudio Reyna says their ambition is to be \u201cthe best in MLS,\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound at all like bragging. It sounds, as Reyna says, like \u201csetting high targets.\u201d They\u2019ve done it before. But this is a business. CFG\u2019s big insight about football is that modern clubs are corporations. And as a very rich corporation CFG wants football to be a story about money rather than a story about souls. Souls are downside risk. Souls are variance. Souls get homesick and fight with their girlfriends or teammates, and when they retire abruptly you\u2019re really in trouble, and the people with the most money usually win. Manchester City\u2019s two-player policy was a statement of intent, but it was also a hedge against the messiness of souls \u2013 at City, players are just as replaceable as anything else. As a corporation, a football club\u2019s just a (very expensively produced) television show that also sells (expensive) T-shirts. Depending on any one individual too heavily invites an unproductive psychodrama. But the one individual CFG can\u2019t solve for is the manager. The players are still live, wobbly souls who go out to represent you every match week, and the manager\u2019s their shepherd\u2014he decides which of those two world-class players start, and what to tell the other one, and which youth to promote, and when to attack and when to counter. In general we understand the manager as the soul of the side\u2014it\u2019s the source of character, and whatever flaws it has you\u2019re stuck with. There\u2019s not another sitting on the bench. And when a club like City do decide to get rid of a manager, a replacement is hard to find. Since 1995, the Premier League\u2019s been won by Mourinho, Pellegrini, Ferguson, Mancini, Ancelotti, and Wenger. They \u2013 plus Guardiola, Van Gaal, and Ben\u00edtez \u2013 are pretty much who a Manchester City \u2013 scale club would call about a vacancy. Too much money\u2019s at stake to take risks. But that\u2019s a poor list \u2013 retirees, rivals, psychodramas, and Ben\u00edtez. That\u2019s why Vieira\u2019s in New York: whatever system\u2019s supposed to periodically burp out new Champions League managers is badly out of order. Ironically, it\u2019s probably football\u2019s love affair with money that\u2019s making it hard for the richest sides to find new managers. For new players, City just reach down to smaller clubs like Wolfsburg or Aston Villa \u2013 talent translates upward. But society changes: 2016\u2019s club-to-club inequality is so vast that managing a small club may not be any preparation for managing a big one. A manager at Manchester City has to be a bully. Has to whip his millionaires in line and send them out in every game \u2013 home or away, Barcelona or Bournemouth \u2013 with goal-scoring, shirt-selling swagger. Everywhere else, management is making do, convincing jaded vets to cower out a yearly 40 points against the drop and keep next year\u2019s TV money. Here it\u2019s easy to become David Moyes \u2013 paranoid, parsimonious, the kind of sideline miser who\u2019s useless to the brand consumers of Seoul or Minneapolis.  So \u2013 how to make a manager? A Nevillesque start at a midsize European club might train Vieira into a flinch he can\u2019t afford at the jobs he really wants; loitering Zidanishly behind the scenes at City risks an unaffordably bad season or two of adaptation. Another answer is: In a small league. Better to be the bully in Porto or New York than the bullied in Yorkshire; no manager who\u2019s ever needed an away draw at Hull can claim to be a special one. And NYCFC have the makings of a bully: Even without mentioning CFG\u2019s money, NYCFC is a talented side in a major media market with some of the league\u2019s best and most marketable players. Bullies need schoolyards of their own. Among all American football\u2019s gloomy bests, the one that matters here might be \u201cbest place to pick on some people of slightly less than your own size.\u201d For someone who\u2019s in New York to learn to be a bully, Patrick Vieira is almost comically kind and tender. He\u2019s big, still lithe, the center of every room he\u2019s in, but his manner is soft, welcoming\u2014almost therapeutic. You\u2019d trust him to comfort you after a mugging but also to chase the mugger down and tie him gently around a lamppost. Note that this unusual combination of personal warmth and unfathomable physical authority is both overwhelmingly charismatic and almost certainly one of Vieira\u2019s chief qualifications to manage a football team or to do any other job involving contact with human beings. If football management really is a judgment on one\u2019s soul, Vieira is going to do just fine.  Ask Vieira if he planned to become a manager and he denies it immediately \u2013 \u201cNo no no,\u201d he says with his breath, like a prayer or a regret. \u201cIt was just something that happened through the years.\u201d At Mourinho\u2019s Inter in 2010, paid but not much played, Vieira had wanted to come back to England. The reasoning was simple: \u201cThat\u2019s where I played my best football.\u201d He landed in the end at Manchester City, a club glad to have his leadership.  Vieira retired from playing the next year but wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted to do. Brian Marwood, a forward-thinking ex-footballer who is now CFG\u2019s managing director of football services, arranged a two-year rotating internship through the club\u2019s various technical and back-office departments. Vieira scouted, bargained, financed, and eventually coached. \u201cWhen I spent time in the academy,\u201d he says, \u201cexchanging ideas with young players, being on the field, the way they were looking at me\u2014I loved it. And I felt really comfortable at it.\u201d Within two years of retiring, he was managing the Under-21 side, for which he gives a great deal of credit to Marwood. \u201cYou need somebody to open your eyes, to tell you there\u2019s things that you can do, and I had that person in Brian Marwood,\u201d he says. \u201cI think if I\u2019m where I am today, it\u2019s because of him.\u201d    Related: Why MLS should just sell itself and not the American dream | Marina Hyde    Where Vieira is today is beginning a career in which something like one manager per decade gets to the level he has targeted. And it seems characteristic of Vieira to give so much of the credit to someone who helped him. Vieira\u2019s plain decency is a mixed blessing to anyone hoping to profile him, because on the one hand it\u2019s a notable and relevant feature of the man, but on the other it makes him unlikely to say anything very explosive in an interview. He is generous and incisive when talking about himself (he lights up at the mention of R\u00e9mi Garde, a \u201creally, really close friend\u201d and fellow managerial beginner) but opaque about his plans for the side and his coaching philosophy. He wants the team to \u201creflect what New York is all about,\u201d finds MLS a \u201creally difficult league physically,\u201d considers the MLS\u2019s arcane roster rules \u201cexciting\u201d, and cares about encouraging \u201cteam spirit\u201d and \u201ctogetherness\u201d in the NYCFC side. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s being safe: The team came 17th out of 20 teams in its first season, despite promising early moves. CFG\u2019s first two NYCFC signings were astute \u2013 manager Jason Kreis was an ex-MLS player with a managerial record of unglamorous rosters, attractive modern football, and excellent Cup finishes; team captain David Villa one of the few designated players who could have still contributed in the European game. From the MLS expansion process, they took a solid core of Kreisy veterans (Ned Grabavoy, Chris Wingert) and interesting young talent (Kwadwo Poku, Mix Diskerud, Khiry Shelton) and augmented with Manchester City academy players. Things looked good, especially after two away draws and a home win in the first three games \u2013 but they eventually conceded a league-worst 58 goals despite their goalkeeper being named player of the month in three of the season\u2019s 10 months. What happened? Maybe Kreis was just a small-club coach \u2013 he lacked the soulful arrogance to get the club playing the way it needed to or the force of character to control the club\u2019s three legendary designated players. Or maybe NYCFC just aren\u2019t yet a very good football team. MLS is a talent-thin league, and NYCFC is largely composed of players taken in an expansion draft that excluded most existing starting XIs. Beyond the three designated players, NYCFC\u2019s baseline is \u201cnot quite MLS starters.\u201d If that\u2019s the only problem, though, Vieira should be OK. There\u2019s plenty of attacking talent in the side, and Vieira and Reyna have already started buying defenders. The bigger concern has to do with NYCFC\u2019s non-Villa designated players and the concerns they raise about CFG\u2019s priorities. In mid-July last year, just before Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo arrived on consecutive late-summer match days, Kreis had the side playing decently. They\u2019d taken a respectable 13 points from the last 7 games. And then the DPs showed up, and NYCFC took only 16 more points from the remaining 14 matches. Pirlo is the key here: a legendary player, a World Cup and Champions League winner who ran 90 minutes of a Champions League final in his last pre-NYCFC match. He\u2019s 37 today, and still has both legs and quality as a deep-lying playmaker. That he\u2019s sculptor-pretty, model-calm, and cerebral enough to title his autobiography I Think Therefore I Play doesn\u2019t hurt either\u2014a new club in a big city needs to make an imprint, and Pirlo\u2019s exactly the kind of icon that\u2019s helped NYCFC pop in local and national media. But Pirlo is maybe not the precise player you\u2019d want as linchpin of your MLS team. He was never the most physical of players, and MLS, as Vieira points out, is indeed physically demanding,\u201d a league about away games in Vancouver and Orlando and populated by uniquely American strivers, Clemson alums who want nothing more than to prove their virtue by harrying an Italian legend. In the 2015 Champions League final, Juventus defended Pirlo with Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal \u2013 a youthful gladiatorial duo with a transfer value of something like $150m. In his first NYCFC season he got 37-year-old Frank Lampard and 30-year-old Andrew Jacobson, of Fort Myers, Florida. Imagine how Jason Kreis would have felt about Pirlo\u2019s addition to the side. The case against Pirlo we\u2019re imagining Kreis making to CFG\u2019s executives is not at all exotic or counterintuitive. The case against Pirlo is just the case against the mid-season introductions of undroppable, limited players into a team that\u2019d just started to look decent. And remember that City are smart. Everyone in the CFG hierarchy could have \u2013 and must have \u2013 understood this. But Pirlo came anyway, and the team struggled. The question for Vieira is whether this, or something like it, is going to happen again. And how to handle Pirlo in the meantime? Pirlo sells shirts and column inches\u2014and makes the team sheet a slightly harder logic problem. NYCFC\u2019s near future has a lot of these decisions, chances to prioritize the club\u2019s medium-term commercial viability or its results this weekend. No one knows which decisions are right or wrong \u2013 but Vieira\u2019s going to be judged strictly on the on-field results. Later that day, at a murky bar on 35th Street, Vieira talks to the fans. Outside, a laser-printed sheet has been slipped into the menu display. \u201cMeet Patrick Vieira,\u201d it promises in rag-right serif, above a gray photograph of the man himself. On the first floor, oblivious, are underwriters, analysts, salaried brunettes stirring lonely drinks. Vieira\u2019s on the second floor, still in his club suit and white shirt, but looking comfortable for the first time all day. He laughs, smiles, discusses an actual tactic or two. A muted television shows the New York Knicks, losing. At a table in the back corner, a poker hand of NYCFC media look forward at Vieira with a savage, unrestrained admiration that looks, already, just a bit like love. The fans here are from a group called the Third Rail. They\u2019re New Yorkers, football fans. Young men with souls a little bigger and a little rougher than their bodies. Men who have wanted to brandish scarves aloft and sing. Men with glasses and expensive haircuts and Arsenal shirts they hope he\u2019ll sign. One becomes a core NYCFC fan, it seems, by discovering sometime in one\u2019s mid-20s that it is hard to feel important in New York, hard to feel first or best at anything. The Third Rail\u2019s logo, hung on a flag behind Vieira, shows a blue art-deco fist clutching three jagged bolts of orange lightning. The allusion is to the local subway system\u2019s power apparatus\u2014a third conducting rail that runs alongside the standard two. As you might imagine, the amperage necessary to run an 840-mile railroad system throughout a city is also amperage sufficient to flash-poach any citizen who touches this rail, which is why they\u2019re both defended by protective covers and notorious in proverb as an important item or issue that\u2019s too dangerous to discuss. NYCFC\u2019s fans, who sing songs like \u201cI wanna Disk-er-ud all night,\u201d know that third rails are both deadly and vital, but they are happy to refer to a crucial urban element that both powers and kills. The fist in their logo is composed of calm ovals and orthogonals: Whatever the power, there\u2019s a hand that can hold it. When Vieira finishes answering their questions, they\u2019re around him in an eager throng, pressing, asking, smiling. Well, look at this handful of bolts: Pirlo, Mansour, Poku, Lampard, Reyna, a position that\u2019ll work for Mix, a way to tighten up that soft back four, always this grasping American press. Can one hand hold it all? Vieira\u2019s done everything in football. He makes journalists want to do keepie-uppies to impress him and is as smart and safe before the press as any club could dream. No doubts remain about his public soul.  But the facts of management are facts behind closed doors: frantic halftime gestures, player meetings, faces after misplaced training passes, certainties about which defender from Pachuca or Cruzeiro will thrive when brought to live and train in Westchester and which will shiver and fail. The best managers of the past 20 years include a semi-pro fullback with a degree in economics, a club translator, an above-average Scottish striker, and a large number of Italians. There is no one in New York or Manchester or Abu Dhabi who can tell you whether Vieira\u2019s NYCFC will make the playoffs, or beat the Red Bulls or solve Pirlo. Vieira himself can\u2019t tell you.  Having to do all these things at once seems hard enough on its own, hard enough at a club whose only purpose was to make you win. Vieira\u2019s paradox is that he\u2019d never be here if it weren\u2019t for CFG. Likely not in management, never in America, never with the full might of Manchester City and the global extractive economy behind him. But power that\u2019s enough to live on is power that\u2019s enough to kill. And the burdens that come with these privileges \u2013 to play your 30-something midfielders as often as they\u2019re fit, to try and find minutes for the kids from Manchester \u2013 can seem like quite a bit of voltage for even Vieira\u2019s capable fist to hold. If the rail proves ungraspable, if NYFC concede 53 more goals and miss the playoffs, it will be Vieira\u2019s career that flounders and CFG whose reinvestment in club that\u2019s made to look heroic. What if money can demand things that souls just can\u2019t accomplish?  \u201cIf I\u2019ve succeeded,\u201d Vieira told me, \u201cthat means I will be here next year, and the year after, and the year after.\u201d This man has moved his whole family to New York to coach a football team that plays in a baseball stadium. All he wants is to keep doing the job for long enough that he becomes the best he can. If Vieira, like football, is foreign in New York, he\u2019s right at home. Our society changes. On the 4 train up to Yankee Stadium, subway advertisements offered affordable worker\u2019s health-care and home delivery of consumer inessentials.  And there it is, spit-shined on the January morning: New York City, proud home of an FC, home for now of Patrick Vieira and of 8 million other protagonists, fists wrapped tight around their bolts of lightning, all of them just hoping they can find a way to be here next year.
