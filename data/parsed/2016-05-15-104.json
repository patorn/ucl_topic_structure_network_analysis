  "body": "Opera is metaphorically fighting in the trenches, but Welsh National Opera \u2013 celebrating 70 years in 2016 \u2013 is carrying the flag for new work like no other company. WNO\u2019s latest premiere \u2013 composer Iain Bell\u2019s setting of the epic poem In Parenthesis by David Jones, is a brave, emphatic statement of intent. Everything about David Pountney\u2019s direction, Robert Innes Hopkins\u2019 design, Carlo Rizzi\u2019s conducting and the strong cast bespeaks total commitment. The story is Jones\u2019 attempt to counter the trauma of the first world war\u2019s slaughter of innocents by invoking the humanity of those he had fought alongside with. (The WNO opera is allied to the UK-wide 14-18 Now programme.) Seeking to examine the essence of life and regeneration rather than that of conflict, Jones translates himself into John Ball, clumsy private, possessed of two left feet, an innocent Johnny Head-in-Air whose natural condition \u2013 to adapt Robert Frost \u2013 is poetry, not soldiering. Jones is also reflected in Dai Greatcoat, the archetypal Everysoldier who has fought in all battles since time immemorial. As Dai, Donald Maxwell\u2019s bravado boasting \u2013 in duet with Graham Clark\u2019s Marne Sergeant \u2013 conjures vivid images, while the moments of greatest compassion are the small gestures and kindnesses imbued with a sacramental quality, the Catholicism to which Jones became a convert.     In Parenthesis with Alexandra Deshorties, right. Photograph: Bill Cooper    The libretto by David Antrobus and Emma Jenkins retains enough of Jones at his most lyrical to honour his intentions. Many of the myriad historical and mythological allusions resonate, with lines from the medieval Welsh poem Y Gododdin appearing as leitmotif. But the librettists go a step further in turning to a later Jones drawing, Epiphany 41, Brittania and Germania Embracing, for their two bardic figures who represent the two nations. Sung by Peter Coleman-Wright and Alexandra Deshorties, they are comparable to Britten\u2019s male and female chorus in The Rape of Lucretia. That symbolic embrace is periodically echoed: in a kiss; in Christmas morning\u2019s Es ist ein Ros entsprungen heard from over the enemy lines; and in the transformation of Deshorties\u2019 Bard of Germania into the Queen of the Woods, anointing the soldiers slain at Mametz. Thus both Christianity and a pantheistic aura combine in the final garlanding of the dead and the Marian hymn Salve Regina.         Director David Poutney and others on creating In Parenthesis    Iain Bell\u2019s instinct for words and vocal line is apparent, evocative when moving into John Ball\u2019s more hallucinatory state with orchestration that is sparse and otherworldly. The music conceived on a more bombastic scale is less convincing, and the female Chorus of Remembrance \u2013 already a slightly invasive presence \u2013 are overwhelming when they reappear as Dryads. If the score ultimately lacks the emotional impact the subject demands, the WNO\u2019s achievement should not be understated. Two things emerge: the extraordinary vision that is Jones\u2019s legacy in art and literature; and the talent of tenor Andrew Bidlack who, as Private Ball, sings heroically. \u2022 At Millennium Centre, Cardiff, 21 May and 3 June.
