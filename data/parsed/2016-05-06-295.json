  "body": "My kitchen \u2026 is in boxes. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve moved around so much, between Australia and Italy, that I now manage with very little equipment. That said, I am missing my Le Creuset pots and pans, which are still waiting for me in Australia. I had a mad thought at one point that I\u2019d bring them back with me, one at a time, in my hand luggage. But they are so heavy \u2026 My favourite kitchen tool is \u2026 my hands. I did a workshop which involved making pastry by hand recently. People seemed really happy to be doing that; it felt like a novelty to them. To me, it\u2019s just the quickest way of working. And there\u2019s far less washing up afterwards. I\u2019m all for less washing up \u2026 My storecupboard staple is \u2026 extra virgin olive oil. We buy huge three-litre jars, and don\u2019t even bother decanting the oil into anything smaller; we just use it up too quickly. It goes in everything \u2013 cooking, dressing, baking. When I\u2019m starving I \u2026 make pasta al pomodoro. If we don\u2019t have that at least once a week, my husband is concerned. It\u2019s his real comfort dish, and my daughter loves it too \u2013 a winner all round. My culinary inspiration is \u2026 Italy. I learnt to cook from Pellegrino Artusi\u2019s 1891 cookbook, Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well. It\u2019s the book you\u2019ll find in most Italian households. It contains about 790 recipes, and when I discovered it, I started cooking them one by one. Even though it is from the 19th century, the dishes are still relevant: they\u2019re exactly what you\u2019ll find in trattorias or people\u2019s homes, especially in Tuscany. Elizabeth David is the other main inspiration: everything she wrote in Italian Food is still totally valid. Things don\u2019t change that quickly in Italy.   Related: My shared kitchen: Izy Hossak | Kitchen encounters    My best-kept kitchen secret is \u2026 to slow down. I cook a lot of rag\u00fas, sauces, soups, stews and I\u2019ve learned that, for best results, you have to be patient. Many things are best cooked the day before you want to eat them. Everything always tastes better with more time. My current obsession is \u2026 bottarga \u2013 a cured fish roe. I\u2019m working on a second cookbook about the coast of southern Tuscany. There\u2019s a lagoon on Monte Agentario island where the fishermen make, by hand, a mullet bottarga, that is very different from the Sardinian kind. It\u2019s cured for just 1 week, so it\u2019s soft and crumbly. It is delicious in spaghetti or eaten in slices with olive oil and lemon juice. It\u2019s very difficult to find outside of Orbitello, where it\u2019s made. Everything tastes better with \u2026 anchovies \u2013 the ones packed in salt, not in oil. I know they\u2019re a bit more fiddly to use, but in terms of texture and flavour they\u2019re incomparable. I\u2019d put them in everything if I could. When I shop I \u2026 go to the market. In Italy, you can instantly tell the season from what\u2019s on offer. I love the relationships you build up with the vendors and I was recently looking for baby artichokes for a recipe I was developping. The vendor asked me what I was going to use them for, and when I told him, he said, \u201cWait until next week \u2013 I\u2019ll be getting more in, they\u2019ll be better.\u201d I love that rapport. I also like being able to choose the exact quantity I need rather than too much.
