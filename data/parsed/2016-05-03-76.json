Much of this alarm, captured in headlines such as \u201cWas Prince a casualty of the opioid epidemic?\u201d and \u201cPrince\u2019s death puts opioid crisis at center stage\u201d, has rightly resulted in calls for better ways to address opioid use in the country. And it has helped us focus on the issue of susceptibility \u2013 if Prince, with all the medical and financial resources available to a multimillionaire, could die from opioid use, it\u2019s clear that we misunderstand how these pain relievers are prescribed and used. It\u2019s also clear that the treatment system we have built on those misunderstandings is causing more harm than good.   Related: Prince's final days: few clues pointed to secret behind star's untimely death    Many, including Prince\u2019s lawyer for the past 25 years, L Londell McMillan, and his personal chef, Ray Roberts, have denied that the musician had an addiction. But whatever the cause of Prince\u2019s death, it provides us with a new lens that looks beyond the continuing stigmatization of those with addiction, which has prevented the creation of effective treatment programs and compassionate laws to assist users, rather than trap them in a permanent and destructive cycle of criminal charges and incarceration.  American history is rife with \u201cdrug panics\u201d, from opium in the 1700s to alcohol in the early 1900s, from coke in the 1970s and crack in the late 80s to methamphetamines in the early aughts. From the beginning, the way that users have been viewed has affected drug regulation and treatment, often with disastrous results. In her new book, Unbroken Brain: A Revolutionary New Way of Understanding Addiction, Maia Szalavitz writes that drug use has been \u201cenmeshed with fears about ethnicity, class and foreigners since the idea was first applied to drug problems and used as a reason to ban substances\u201d. Blame for addiction (and related deaths) has most often been placed on the substance or on its users, who are viewed as weak-willed, dishonest individuals, often minorities or the poor, worthy only of forced \u201ccold turkey\u201d detox and incarceration. But statistics regarding opioid use have exposed the lie at the heart of our assumptions about who uses them.  According to a 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, opioid use has increased among all demographic groups, even as heroin rates \u201cremained highest among males, persons aged 18\u201325 years, persons with annual household incomes less than $20,000, persons living in urban areas and persons with no health insurance or with Medicaid\u201d. Most heroin overdoses involved the use of other drugs; cocaine use was the highest indicator of heroin use, and non-medical opioid use was the second highest. Only 22% of those who misuse prescription opioids get them from their doctor, and recent coverage has continued to condemn opioids without fully acknowledging their incredible benefits to patients in pain. The problems \u2013 and deaths \u2013 that result from opioid use in the US stem primarily from two issues: doctors often are not trained in how to prescribe opioids, so they and their patients seldom understand the risks (for instance, studies have shown that the vast majority \u2013 up to 90% \u2013 of overdoses occur when opioids are used with other drugs); and our understanding and treatment of addiction is all wrong.   Related: Drug addiction should be treated like a learning disorder \u2013 not a crime | Maia Szalavitz    In Unbroken Brain, Szalavitz identifies addiction not as the result of individual weakness or a character flaw, nor as a result of the nature of the drugs, but as a learning disorder, developed predominantly in the young as they learn to use drugs. Addiction, then, is a coping mechanism for overcoming challenges such as poverty, trauma, insecurity and mental disability or illness. Yet addicts continue to be shamed, adding to their fear and increasing their need to use. \u201cThe heroin epidemic in these communities is like a symptom,\u201d photographer Michelle Frankfurter told a journalist when she visited southern Ohio to photograph people addicted to opioids. The shame of addiction makes finding treatment difficult. New laws meant to limit opioid use often force those with addiction to find illegal heroin. Maintenance programs that could help users live long enough to outgrow their addictions (which Szalavitz writes can often occur by the time users reach their 30s) are expensive and highly regulated, often not providing doses strong enough to stabilize users. Still, the dangers of opioid use are exaggerated. \u201cIf you do not have a past history of addiction and are in your forties and getting pain treatment with opioids, your odds of becoming newly addicted are low,\u201d Szalavitz told Karla K Johnson of the Associated Press last week. \u201cOne study of thousands of ER visits for overdose found that only 13% of victims had a chronic pain diagnosis.\u201d The results of toxicology reports from Prince\u2019s autopsy will probably not be released for weeks, until a full investigation has been completed. Whatever the cause of his death, the reported connection to opioids will likely compound fears regarding the treatment of pain and addiction.  But it should also make us reconsider how we look at opioid users \u2013 and our nation\u2019s addiction problem. Prince\u2019s death should give us the opportunity to reframe our understanding of the \u201copioid epidemic\u201d in ways that help those with addiction, not continue to jeopardize people\u2019s treatment and their lives.",
