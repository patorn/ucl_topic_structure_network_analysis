Wannabe armchair psychiatrists were quick to denounce Opi Baron as \u201cobviously mentally ill\u201d, while the accusations that \u201cbeing transgender is fashionable\u201d still fly thick and fast (despite the first known British male-to-female transgender surgery being performed on an RAF pilot in the 1950s but, you know what they say, fashion comes back around). Thousands upon thousands of women have breast enhancement surgery every year to alter the \u201cnatural\u201d configuration of their chests to match how they would prefer it to look. One of my cousins underwent a breast enlargement a few years ago, and her family and friends were supportive, accepting her explanation that the procedure would increase her self-confidence. Yet when I announced that I wanted a chest reduction, I was met with horror and stony silence from certain members of my family. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Well, yes, I can. And when you\u2019ve given 10 years of consideration to something, I think you can conclude you\u2019ve thought about it pretty carefully. The writer James Delingpole suggested starting a petition for me to keep them attached to my body, with the insistent headline: \u201cWe need to talk about Dr Jack Monroe\u2019s breasts\u201d. So, James, I\u2019m ready to talk. Another journalist suggested that there should be Kickstarter funding for my own surgery, obsessed as the chattering classes are by other people\u2019s bodies, as evidenced by the bloated monster that is the Sidebar of Shame, and the red-circled shrieks, screaming from the newsstands, about the odd crow\u2019s foot or rogue patch of acne. Quelle horreur, people are people, after all.    I was criticised for my 'proposed removal of a pair of healthy breasts', as though breasts are a trophy    I remember sitting over breakfast with my mum a few months ago, awkwardly trying to answer her questions about being transgender. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to make any permanent changes that you might regret \u2026\u201d she started. I laughed and gestured to my 44 tattoos before gently countering that it might be too late to start with all of that. \u201cYou dye your hair, Mum,\u201d I pointed out. She tried to look indignant, but that shimmery ash-blonde at 52? I wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cWe change ourselves in so many ways. We lose or gain weight. Get tattoos, piercings, get them removed, take them out. We dye our hair, change our clothes, paint our nails. Sure, these are small things, compared with what could be a major surgical procedure, but I just know I have to do this.\u201d I was heavily criticised by some users on Mumsnet for my \u201cproposed removal of a pair of healthy breasts\u201d, as though breasts are a trophy, and I am a fool to part with mine. Perhaps so, but this body dysphoria runs deep, and I would be a fool to tolerate it when I don\u2019t have to. A startling confession for a food writer: all through high school, I struggled with a severe eating disorder. It started as a control mechanism, at a school where I was the only one from my special-measures junior school to make it, the only one who was dropped off in a white Essex Fire Service Ford Transit van half a mile from the school gate every morning, clambering out of the back like an A-Team mascot, only with thick round glasses and a satchel. I struggled at school, socially, mentally, academically. I\u2019m not organised, and I don\u2019t cope well with deadlines, structure and routine. I\u2019m chaotic. Always have been. And so I started to starve myself. It started with giving my lunch away, then skipping breakfast, then walking home from school instead of catching three buses, in a bid to be thinner, thinner, thinner. Being thinner would solve everything, I thought. I started walking to school too. Seven miles a day. I remember the day I could fit into my year-7 school skirt, with its 20-inch waist, at 15 years old. I remember my parents realising that I was cutting my dinner up and pushing it around my plate, piling it high at one side, seeing how gaunt and exhausted I had become. I remember spending PE lessons in the sick bay, collapsing during netball. And I remember being told that if I didn\u2019t start eating properly again, I would be sent to hospital, locked away, forced to eat through tubes down my throat. I remember sleeping in the library, upstairs where the sixth formers went, instead of going to my classes. I remember begrudgingly regaining weight. I remember the despair; nobody knew what to do with me. Not my form tutor, nor my kindly head of pastoral care and discipline. I remember confiding in my food technology teacher. I remember loving food tech because of the precision and the creativity, the weights and measures, the tiny glimpses of flavour. I remember taking my carefully crafted meals home and watching my parents enjoy them. I remember food no longer being an enemy, but a joy. But with my new-found love of food came puberty. I gained enough weight that I began to menstruate. My breasts began to develop. And I hated it. I had been boyish and braless for 15 years and that\u2019s who I was. I pretended my name was Adam as a young girl. I prayed to God at night that I would turn into a boy when I started to develop. Something was wrong, deep down, but I didn\u2019t know what it was or how to fix it.    That\u2019s the thing about being trans that armchair commentators can\u2019t comprehend: it\u2019s a condition, just like any other    I started to bind my breasts. I wrapped bandages around them to hold them down. I didn\u2019t want them at all. I thought they were ugly, messy, cumbersome. Not mine, not a part of me I wanted or identified as my own. I have no connection with them. I feel nothing there, something I have had to explain gently to various lovers over the years, who can\u2019t understand the disconnect, especially as the rest of my skin is hypersensitive. I\u2019m still the only person I\u2019ve met who can orgasm from the right touch to my wrist (I\u2019m not going to tell you which one!). But my breasts are just not part of me at all. I bought my first chest binder at the age of 19. This isn\u2019t a phase. When I had my first appointment at the gender clinic earlier this year, I sat and talked completely openly to a doctor for the first time. That\u2019s the thing about being trans that the armchair commentators can\u2019t comprehend: it\u2019s a condition, just like any other. Although our experiences are all different, there are symptoms, there are questions that need to be asked, and criteria that need to be fulfilled in order to reach a diagnosis. My medical report diagnosed me as transgender. I have been on hormones now for eight months. I walk taller, laugh more, feel myself. I mostly, finally, fit in my skin. Friends have commented on how much more confident I am. I\u2019m not spending days in bed in fits of darkness and depression. I eat what the hell I like. I like myself.

And I know what I\u2019m doing with it, and why I\u2019m doing it, and it\u2019s not up for debate. I\u2019m not an object. I didn\u2019t fall off a factory line. I\u2019m a little bit female and a little bit male and unless you\u2019re a doctor sitting there with my medical history in your hands, physiological and psychiatric, I\u2019m not going to put myself in your hands. You can tell me I\u2019m not a boy until you\u2019re blue in the face, but to quote my good friend, author and longtime trans activist Christine Burns, it\u2019s as good as saying that the sugar is salt.  This article was corrected on 19 May because it wrongly stated that the first male-to-female transgender surgery in Britain had been carried out in the 1940s. It was actually the 1950s",
