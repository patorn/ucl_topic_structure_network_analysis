Related: Exclusive extract: Career of Evil by Robert Galbraith (the pseudonym of JK Rowling)    \u201cRacing up and down the country, chasing suspects from the London suburbs to Barrow-in-Furness, from Scotland via Market Harborough to lap-dancing clubs on Tottenham Court Road, the narrative is dizzying in its proliferation of character, location and detail, and tirelessly, relentlessly specific,\u201d wrote Guardian reviewer Christobel Kent of the third outing for tetchy private eye Cormoran Strike. Galbraith joins two-time winner Mark Billingham on the shortlist, which also includes two debuts: Disclaimer, by former TV documentary maker Renee Knight, which was touted as the new Gone Girl, and I Let You Go by former CID officer Clare Mackintosh, which won the Richard & Judy book club award and became one of the fastest selling titles of 2015.    Related: How crime fighting provides clues to crime writing    The shortlist is completed by Eva Dolan\u2019s highly topical Tell No Tales, in which DI Zigic and DS Ferreira of the Peterborough Hate Crimes Unit investigate the murder of migrant workers, and Rain Dogs, the fifth outing for Adrian McKinty\u2019s Belfast-based 1980s maverick RUC inspector Sean Duffy. The winner of the \u00a33,000 award, which comes with a handmade, engraved oak beer cask, will be revealed on the opening night of the Theakston Old Peculier crime writing festival in Harrogate on July 21.
