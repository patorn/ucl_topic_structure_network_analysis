  "body": "Losing the ability to make music can be suffocating. Clarence Adoo knows this only too well. The trumpet-player was paralysed from the neck down after a car accident 20 years ago. \u201cPlaying music was like eating or drinking,\u201d says Adoo, who was a member of the Royal Northern Sinfonia. \u201cBeing unable to do it left me doubly paralysed. I would rather play music than walk again.\u201d Seven years after his accident, composer and engineer Rolf Gelhaar built Adoo a breath-controlled electronic instrument called the Headspace. A headset allows Adoo to select notes via an on-screen cursor and a twist of the neck, while blowing into a tube plays the note and tilting his head varies the volume. Adoo was now able to make music again \u2013 and in 2012 became one of the founder members of the British Paraorchestra. Although Adoo\u2019s case is extreme, he\u2019s far from the only musician who, after finding themselves creatively crippled by physical limitations, regained the ability to play thanks to developments in technology \u2013 and the ingenuity of a growing number of technologists and hackers.             Guitarist Kris Halpin has cerebral palsy. Three years ago, he began to lose strength in his hands. \u201cWhen I had to start taking songs out of the set list,\u201d he says, \u201cthat was scary.\u201d Then he came across the Mi.mu gloves, created by a team of engineers for Imogen Heap, who wanted a form of wearable tech that would be more visually impressive in a performance than twiddling with dials. According to the Mi.mu website, the gloves combine \u201cadvanced motion tracking electronics\u201d with \u201ca truly elegant fusion of traditional textiles\u201d. Although the technology wasn\u2019t specifically designed for disabled people, the gloves were game-changing for Halpin, one of only 20 people to own a pair. He was able, earlier this year, to tour the UK, virtually plucking strings and smashing drums. \u201cTwo years ago,\u201d he says, \u201cI never would have thought that possible.\u201d     John Kelly, musician and campaigner, who sang Ian Dury\u2019s Spasticus Autisticus at the 2012 Paralympics     There\u2019s more to this than equal opportunities, says Gawain Hewitt of Drake Music, a charity that uses technology to open music up for disabled people. \u201cThis is about who is telling our stories. If we exclude one section of society from this medium, we are all poorer for it.\u201d In a bid to combat this, Hewitt organises regular hack events, bringing together coders, designers and engineers in \u201ca traditional British garden-shed way\u201d. Drake isn\u2019t the only group out there. The One-Handed Instrument Trust modifies classical instruments for amputees, and there are various electronic tools available, from the motion-sensor Soundbeam to apps such as Thumbjam and Brian Eno\u2019s Bloom. But, says Hewitt, what we need are truly original instruments. \u201cWe want to move away from the concept of two or three \u2018special\u2019 instruments for disabled people. Just as for the abled, there should be a range.\u201d Things would move faster if more technologists knew this field existed, says musician and hacker Adam John Williams, director of the Music Tech Fest hack camps. \u201cThe importance of music is overlooked by the very people who can enable others to make it,\u201d says the 26-year-old who \u2013 due to a neurological condition \u2013 spent part of his early 20s in a wheelchair.            Williams created a bass guitar with an \u201ceffects pedal\u201d built into its front, eliminating the need for foot control, and embedded an iPad into a digital guitar, replacing its strings. He called the latter, which won an award, the Quirkitar. \u201cBecause of my experience,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I make an instrument I think, \u2018Would everybody be able to play this?\u2019 If more people approached their work this way, there would be more cool stuff in the world. Look at the Paralympics \u2013 the public found overcoming a physical disability inspiring. But artistic expression by the disabled is just not appreciated in the same way.\u201d One big barrier remains. \u201cIf you are a talented disabled musician,\u201d says Williams, \u201cyou aren\u2019t seen as a talented musician \u2013 you\u2019re seen as a talented disabled musician.\u201d Halpin agrees. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s still a case of, \u2018Oh, a disabled person is having a go \u2013 that\u2019s nice.\u2019\u201d John Kelly, the musician and campaigner who sang Ian Dury\u2019s Spasticus Autisticus at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics, plays a Kellycaster, a guitar made for him by Drake. It\u2019s one of a kind, as most musical devices built for special needs are. The Kellycaster highlights how most technologists approach the problem: address the specific needs of one person with a tailor-made device. For most, this makes the instruments prohibitively expensive: a pair of Mi.mu gloves costs \u00a35,000. So specialist instrument-makers and musicians depend on grants and private donations.            Vahakn Matossian, Rolf Gelhaar\u2019s son, has built Adoo an instrument with more range and versatility than the Headspace. \u201cMost digital interfaces lack expression,\u201d Matossian explains. \u201cNotes are just on or off.\u201d So his HiNote uses a breath pressure sensor to vary volume more subtly and, to kick the sonic range up a notch, there\u2019s a range of quirky, psychedelic sound palettes as well as classical instruments. However, his ambitions lie beyond Adoo and his HiNote. \u201cThere are no off-the-shelf truly expressive devices,\u201d says Matossian who, with his startup company Human Instruments, hopes to produce a new kind of mass-market instrument tailored for the disabled for less than \u00a3400, which he is calling a \u201ctouch board instrument\u201d.  Adoo test drove the HiNote in Newcastle last year. \u201cThe software has gone way up in sophistication \u2013 and that inspires me to be more creative. It will allow me to do things I\u2019ve never been able to do. Most importantly, it has a more natural way of blowing, so I can produce new effects.\u201d How does he see the future? \u201cI think there are great times ahead. It\u2019s like dipping one toe in the water: it doesn\u2019t take long before you are in above your waist.\u201d            Adoo is now concentrating on mastering the HiNote. Assistive devices are often seen as facile, but these instruments are actually complex and challenging, just like those made for able-bodied people. As for Halpin and his gloves, he mentions his annoyance at a Buzzfeed post about the Mi.mu gloves headlined These Gloves Turn Anyone Into A Talented Musician (And we have Imogen Heap to thank). \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of putting the gloves on and waving your hands about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes practice and skill.\u201d \u2022 Clarence Adoo performs with the HiNote for the first time at the Setubal music festival, Portugal, 26-29 May, and gives its UK premiere in a performance of Terry Riley\u2019s In C with the British Paraorchestra at Colston Hall, Bristol, on 3 June.",
