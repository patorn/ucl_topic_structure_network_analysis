The British Film Institute (BFI) proposal had been backed personally by Gordon Brown and the last Labour government, which promised \u00a345m of public money. But the financial crisis and change of government led to the commitment being withdrawn. The BFI put its plans on ice, remaining in its 1950s building between the National Theatre and the Southbank Centre that it has been desperate to vacate for decades. On Wednesday the BFI announced it had received an \u201cunsolicited\u201d offer of up to \u00a387m for a new centre, which would be built on the nearby site of Hungerford Bridge car park. A spokeswoman said the investor could not be named because of laws around public procurement, as there may now be other potential investors. \u201cIf we have an offer that\u2019s made for investment in any part of our organisation, we then have to go to market,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the same for any suppliers we use.\u201d The BFI stressed that such a huge investment would not threaten its independence as a public body. The money is for the building itself, the spokeswoman said. \u201cWhoever invests in this development won\u2019t have any say creatively in how the new centre is run or its content. It is absolutely detached from any creative control.\u201d The investor would, though, have a strong case for having the building named after them. The BFI said the new centre would give visitors \u201cnew experiences in film while providing a hub for filmmakers, artists and industry professionals to meet, exchange ideas, showcase their work and develop skills.\u201d A tender process has begun with the aspiration of opening the new \u00a3130m building by 2022. The new centre would be on the Thames riverside and create some 6,500 sq metres of new parkland on Jubilee Gardens. The announcement of a new investor comes only three months after the appointment of the Warner Bros studio executive Josh Berger as chair of the BFI, succeeding Greg Dyke. Berger said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s thriving film, TV and screen industries are world-class, fuelled by the vision and imagination of extraordinary British talent who are evolving our art form at speed. As the new chair, one of my priorities will be to drive forward the BFI\u2019s new centre to provide the opportunity to showcase British talent, creativity and vision to the world.  \u201cIt will inspire the next generation of award-wining British talent, film-makers and visual effects geniuses, and give audiences one of the best places in the world to experience film in all its forms.\u201d The BFI\u2019s chief executive, Amanda Nevill, said British film deserved a home \u201cnow more than ever \u2013 a building that will express our optimism, our confidence and our excitement about Britain\u2019s leading role in the future of film, television and the moving image at home and internationally\u201d. The news was also welcomed by a host of British film stars. Tom Hiddleston said: \u201cI believe this is the most exciting cultural development to happen in the UK for some time.  \u201cAll the major art forms in Britain quite correctly have national homes except one: film. British film \u2013 the tradition which has created and produced so much extraordinary talent both in front of and behind the camera \u2013 needs a national home, and the BFI is the organisation to build it.\u201d Dame Helen Mirren said: \u201cThe proposal for a new centre is a very exciting one and will bring young people and their energies and understanding of the modern world into this amazing form of culture and of self-expression \u2013 cinema.\u201d And Idris Elba said: \u201cBritain is a great centre of creativity and film is at its heart. If we want to see this continue to flourish, then we have to encourage young people from all backgrounds to think about it as a career, which we aren\u2019t going to do if we don\u2019t shout about it. It\u2019s time we had a proper national home worthy of this 21st century art form, and I\u2019m excited for all of the brilliant opportunities this will bring.\u201d",
