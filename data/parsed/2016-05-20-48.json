  "body": "No explanation has yet emerged for why EgyptAir flight MS804 crashed en route from Paris to Cairo with 66 passengers and crew on board. Although Egypt conceded that terrorism seemed more likely to have caused the disaster than a technical error, no group has claimed responsibility.  So what are the theories investigators could be looking at?  A bomb   Related: Body part and seats from EgyptAir flight MS804 found, says Greece    A terrorist motive is highly plausible, given recent attacks in France and the downing in Egyptian airspace of the Russian Metrojet airliner last year that killed 224 people. Russia declared in mid-November it had found sufficient evidence of an improvised explosive having caused that disaster. Security experts fear that airport staff with access to sensitive areas pose as much of an inside threat in major European hubs such as Paris\u2019s Charles de Gaulle as in north African airports.  The EgyptAir plane should have been searched repeatedly on its last 24-hour itinerary via Cairo, Eritrea and Tunisia. But French ministers acknowledged that a bomb could have been smuggled aboard at Charles de Gaulle, despite heightened security measures, and any lapse would be a serious blow to passenger confidence in air travel. Some experts have said the final movements of the plane \u2013 a 90-degree turn to the left followed by a 360-degree rightwards turn, according to data from Greek military radar \u2013 could indicate a plane out of control after an explosion, although others have cautioned against reading too much into the movements.           Missing EgyptAir flight: what we know so far    A missile Jean-Paul Troadec, the former president of France\u2019s air accident investigation bureau, said a missile was a possibility.  Although the EgyptAir flight was not flying over a war zone, the shooting down of flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in 2014 demonstrated the vulnerability of passenger airliners, even at 33,000 feet (10,058 metres). While Nato military exercises have been conducted with aircraft carriers and jets in the eastern Mediterranean, potential jihadi terrorists are not believed to have weapons with sufficient range, even over land, and the EgyptAir flight was at an altitude of 37,000 feet.  A British holiday jet travelling to Egypt last autumn reportedly came close to an army missile that was later discounted as a flare from military exercises, while the government denied there had been any risk to the plane.  A deliberate act of sabotage The swerving of the plane could suggest a struggle for control, perhaps in a hijack situation or even between crew members.  After 9/11, hijackers have had a harder task to reach the flight deck since locked doors were introduced \u2013 but the locks have made it easier for a pilot or an intruder to sabotage a flight.  The lack of a mayday or a response to air traffic control requests for a 12-minute period before the plane spiralled down will be a question for investigators.  The pilot of flight MS804, Mohamed Said Shoukair, had more than 6,000 flying hours, while the co-pilot, Mohamed Mamdouh Ahmed, had almost 3,000.  Since the disappearance of flight MH370, pilots have been under suspicion \u2013 and the deliberate crashing of a Germanwings plane by its co-pilot in 2015 has demonstrated the terrible possibilities, which airline bosses at Lufthansa admitted they could take no real measures to avert.  International investigations into the 1999 EgyptAir disaster concluded that the co-pilot of flight 990 from LA to Cairo deliberately crashed the plane into the Atlantic, although Egypt rejected the findings.  Mechanical failure   Related: What do we know about why EgyptAir flight MS804 crashed?    Industry wisdom is that the chances of anything suddenly going wrong on a modern plane are extremely slim: the A320 is the workhorse of short-haul aviation and an Airbus mantra is that one such model takes off or lands somewhere in the world every two seconds.  At cruising altitude in good weather, the probabilities are even more remote. But the history of aviation shows that technical failures have led to disaster. A combination of events The increasing sophistication of planes has in some circumstances left pilots even more susceptible when things go wrong: when readings have not tallied or the controls don\u2019t function as they should.  Only 18 months ago, an Indonesia AirAsia Airbus A320 crashed in the Java Sea after stalling during an abnormally steep climb. Investigators found that a malfunction in rudder controls and an automated warning triggered a chain of events that saw the pilots mishandle the plane.  A similar combination of abnormal readings, warnings and overreaction by disoriented pilots was found to be behind the Air France 447 disaster.  Tony Cable, a former AAIB investigator, worked on A320 incidents and said: \u201cWith electrical system problems, you get absolute mayhem in the cockpit with all sorts of messages and cockpits and alarms and it can be difficult for the crew to work out what\u2019s going on. The action you can take is to flick a switch to reset the controls.  \u201cBut in some cases the crew haven\u2019t operated this, and in my view they have got quite close to catastrophe \u2013 if it was at night they could have turned out badly.\u201d",
