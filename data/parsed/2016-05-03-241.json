  "body": "For the past 10 years we have received the Guardian Weekly as a gift from my mother-in-law, a British expat who has lived in Montreal, Canada, for the past 45 years. We live in Vancouver and the Guardian Weekly is part of our family. It is always on the kitchen table and if it is missing it is always a big deal, and must be located immediately. If my wife brings it to work, this is a problem. We always tell whoever will listen (and they all listen) that this paper is our lifeline to the real news in the world, curated over the course of a week with thoughtful analysis. We have au pairs who live with us and we always dare them to read it consistently over the course of their stay to become better informed and inspired about the world. They often take the challenge and it is great to see their world-views awaken. I am a social studies teacher and the paper is my go-to for class discussions. My wife is a lawyer who works with aboriginal groups here in British Columbia. She often finds articles that support and invigorate her work. It is great to have a perspective that is partly outside of North America. We feel more worldly, connected and open-minded as a result. I love photography and the photo centrefold is great. In short, we love the Guardian Weekly and can\u2019t imagine life without it. Full stop. If you would like to appear in this\u00a0space, send a brief note to guardian.weekly@theguardian.com",
