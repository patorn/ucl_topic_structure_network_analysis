  "body": "In his commencement address to Howard University graduates on Saturday, Barack Obama made specific mention of a new generation of black activists, including those involved in Black Lives Matter and \u201cblack Twitter\u201d, for raising national awareness over inequality in the criminal justice system.   Related: Seven days, three speeches: one week in the life of having a black president    His praise came with a series of suggestions about how activists could most easily create actual change: through electoral politics and compromise.  \u201cTo bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt requires changes in law, changes in custom.\u201d  Obama stressed the need for willingness to sit at the table with opponents and openness to imperfect victories in his address to the historically black university in Washington DC.  \u201cYou consolidate your gains and then you move on to the next fight from a stronger position,\u201d he said. For many of the activists Obama appeared to be addressing, the advice was welcome but not necessarily new. According to Brittany Packnett, whom Obama mentioned by name, it is what many in the movement \u201chave been advocating for from the start\u201d. Obama mentioned Packnett\u2019s role in his taskforce on 21st-century policing.  \u201cSome of her fellow activists questioned whether she should participate,\u201d he said. \u201cShe rolled up her sleeves and sat at the same table with big-city police chiefs and prosecutors. And because she did, she ended up shaping many of the recommendations of that taskforce.\u201d On Monday, Packnett said activism required engagement on all fronts.  \u201cI came to that table with the spirit of activism,\u201d she said, \u201crecognizing that that conversation was going to be had anyways. It was important to me to accept the responsibility and the privilege to help bring some of those things I have learned from people on the streets.\u201d DeRay Mckesson, one of the most visible Black Lives Matter activists and a leader of We the Protesters, said policy and street protests informed one another.  \u201cThe pressure created a different table to be at,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the pressure from all of us being in the streets, there would have been no 21st-century taskforce on policing, so this is a \u2018both-and\u2019, not an \u2018either-or\u2019, situation.\u201d Mckesson said the possibility that protest could lead to policy changes that do not align with activists\u2019 goals becomes a serious problem when protesters do not engage with policy.  As an example, he cited the adoption of body cameras as a response to concerns about police violence \u2013 a change many activists find underwhelming. \u201cThat is a sign that we weren\u2019t actually a part of the process, so an \u2018outside only\u2019 strategy is not a strategy to win,\u201d Mckesson said. Samuel Sinyangwe, who works with McKesson and Packnett on Campaign Zero, a policy thinktank on police violence, said the president \u201cwas highlighting a truth, that awareness is not enough, but it does matter\u201d. He added: \u201cI do think awareness matters in and of itself when you look at the fact that this issue is bigger than policy. It\u2019s also about our culture and our inability to understand our own biases and how they contribute to the situations that we see in terms of people being killed by police.\u201d The president also cautioned protesters away from silencing or interrupting political opponents. \u201cIf they\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said, \u201crebut them. Teach them. Beat them on the battlefield of ideas.\u201d April Reign, a prominent black Twitter voice and the originator of the #oscarssowhite hashtag, said she could see the president\u2019s point. But she added that sometimes the opposite tactics could be extremely effective.    Related: O'Malley and Sanders interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters in Phoenix    \u201cBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton discussing issues that directly affect black people and the Black Lives Matter movement would not have happened had there not been disruption of their speeches,\u201d Reign said.  \u201cIt was a wake-up call to them and to progressives, the Democratic party and the country that our votes must be earned.\u201d There was broad agreement that the president\u2019s willingness to dive into issues of race was inspiring and important. Obama encouraged Howard graduates to \u201cbe confident in [their] blackness\u201d and to embrace a broad understanding of racial authenticity.  \u201cThere\u2019s no one way to be black,\u201d he said. Sinyangwe said: \u201cI thought it was powerful to hear him speak freely about blackness. It\u2019s freeing to a lot of people to recognize that their identities are recognized.\u201d Reign said much of the speech reflected thought Obama has wanted to share for years but could not because of the constraints of the presidency.  \u201cNow that he\u2019s got his second-term swag on, he\u2019s able to let loose a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he hit a lot of the right marks and I think it\u2019s one for the ages.\u201d",
