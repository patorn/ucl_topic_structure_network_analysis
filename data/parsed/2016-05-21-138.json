  "body": "There is, of course, form in this sort of thing: the Beatles\u2019 Magical Mystery Tour, featuring English eccentric Viv Stanshall and Scottish humorist Ivor Cutler; Ken Kesey\u2019s bus Further, filled with Merry Pranksters, driven by key Beat Generation member Neal Cassady and commemorated in 1968 in Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test; the Union Jack-emblazoned bus that carted Sporty, Posh, Ginger, Scary and Baby around in Spice World. Now Carol Ann Duffy, the UK\u2019s poet laureate, has invited three poets to join her on a road trip through England, Wales and Scotland, which will take them from Falmouth to St Andrews over the course of a fortnight. \u201cNo drugs on the bus!\u201d she says, which won\u2019t be a problem, although Gillian Clarke, the outgoing national poet of Wales, insists on some good red wine. Jackie Kay, poet and novelist, and now the new makar, the national poet for Scotland, remembers a previous poetry tour on which \u201cone of the poets was an alcoholic, and all you could hear were these bottles rolling back and forth. It was a nightmare. I remember the bus kept having to be stopped for him to get out and pee in all sorts of different places. You could see him at a roundabout, baring his willy to the skies.\u201d \u201cNo willies on this bus!\u201d says Imtiaz Dharker, Pakistan-born British poet and winner of the Queen\u2019s gold medal for poetry. It\u2019s a long way from villanelles and anapaests, but this lorryload of laureates \u2013 Clarke for Wales, Kay for Scotland, Duffy for the UK and Dharker, in Duffy\u2019s words, in the notional role of world laureate (\u201cI just tag along,\u201d she laughs) \u2013 are joyful souls. Before we\u2019ve chatted for very long in the lounge of a Manchester hotel, they summon up a bottle of champagne to toast their venture.     Imtiaz Dharker: described by Duffy as world laureate. Photograph: ANL/Rex Shutterstock    They are good friends, and collaborators. Not to mention ex-partners: Kay and Duffy met at a poetry reading in London in 1986 and later embarked on a relationship that lasted 15 years; their conversation is punctuated with familiar laughter. Clarke, meanwhile, first met Duffy when she awarded her a prize in the early 1980s; having judged the competition blind, she remembers thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s a woman, and it\u2019s a young woman!\u201d Kay remembers a similar experience when she had just had her son, Matthew, now in his 20s: \u201cI\u2019d written this poem about a miner who\u2019d fallen in love with another miner. They thought I\u2019d be a man, so they were quite surprised that this woman turned up with a wee baby.\u201d All four regularly participate in Poetry Live!, an initiative that puts hundreds of poets in front of huge audiences of schoolchildren, which was founded by Dharker\u2019s late husband, Simon Powell, in 2009.    Remember chaps at\u00a0microphones with\u00a0bits of paper and a pint of beer? Live poetry used to be very boring  Gillian Clarke     It was Duffy who had the idea for a road trip, led by a desire to celebrate the independent bookshops that do so much to underpin live poetry, and to connect with an equally loyal readership. Contemporary poetry \u2013 sometimes perceived as wilfully obscure, the preserve of both a particular kind of writer and a particular kind of reader \u2013 has broadened to embrace and include a wealth of different audiences. Clarke, who is 78, remembers a different time: \u201cIn the olden days, do you remember chaps at microphones with bits of paper and a pint of beer, and they would drop things, and say \u2013 \u2018I think I\u2019ll read another one, it\u2019s in six parts\u2019? It used to be very boring.\u201d Now, you\u2019re more likely to be mesmerised by the direct and explicit readings of Andrew McMillan, the poet who won last year\u2019s Guardian first book award, or the medium-busting energy of Kate Tempest, whom all the poets here agree is prodigiously talented. (I recently interviewed her in front of a sold-out and ecstatic audience in London, and the whooping and hollering when she read seemed to indicate a genuine sea change.)

Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Redferns    The laureates might be older than Tempest and McMillan \u2013 though they submit to squeezing in and out of the Guardian\u2019s rented Mini with terrific grace \u2013 but they have all put that same desire to connect with audiences at the heart of their careers. \u201cWe\u2019ve all hoped to be writing pioneers of one sort or another,\u201d says Kay who, as makar, now has a much bigger platform. What does she hope to achieve? \u201cI really want to take poetry into expected and unexpected places,\u201d says the 54-year-old, who wrote the award-winning novel Trumpet, inspired by the life of Billy Tipton, the jazz musician who was born a woman but concealed her gender identity for decades. Kay\u2019s work has ranged widely over personal relationships, adoption and the legacy of the slave trade, adapting different forms along the way. \u201cI am the first black makar,\u201d she says, \u201cand I think it\u2019s very important to be outspoken. I\u2019ve felt outspoken all my life, and the minute I feel I\u2019m not a radical voice, I\u2019ll shut up shop.\u201d Duffy jokes that while Scotland has taken a dozen years to appoint a black makar, it took the UK nearly 400 to find a female laureate. \u201cI\u2019m stealing that!\u201d Kay laughs.     Jackie Kay: \u2018It\u2019s very important to be outspoken.\u2019 Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA Wire    In the early days of Clarke\u2019s tenure, when her burning ambition was to challenge the divisions between north and south Wales, and between Wales and the rest of the UK, she used to go anywhere that would have her; she has been known to turn up to primary schools with a ram\u2019s head in her handbag to pique the children\u2019s interest. Having served Wales for eight years, she is handing over to poet Ifor ap Glyn. In a time of squeezed resources, closing libraries and an antagonistic, adversarial public discourse, do the poets think of their role as disrupters, challengers to authority? \u201cTo me,\u201d Dharker says, \u201cit\u2019s the idea of getting people who thought poetry didn\u2019t belong to them, wherever they are in the world \u2013 almost mugging them with poetry.\u201d You could argue that Duffy has spent her career doing just this; as she puts it, \u201cPoetry has kind of been my life. It\u2019s how I see everything. That\u2019s how I explain both myself and the world to myself.\u201d She is seven years into her 10-year stint as laureate and throughout has focused on breaking down barriers; her public poems have addressed subjects from MPs\u2019 expenses to David Beckham\u2019s achilles tendon to the deaths of the last British soldiers to fight in the first world war. I tell her how affecting it was recently to watch the live broadcast from Liverpool\u2019s St George\u2019s Hall, which saw the families of the 96 victims of Hillsborough gather after the long-awaited verdict that the victims were killed unlawfully. Among the speeches came a rendition of Duffy\u2019s poem Liverpool, her tribute to the \u201cslandered dead\u201d: \u201cOver this great city, light after long dark;/truth, the sweet silver song of the lark.\u201d I also recall, a few years ago, a very low-lit, quiet, late-night festival green room; I had asked Duffy if she\u2019d give me a few words for a podcast. She\u2019d happily read a poem, she said, whereupon she produced a slightly dog-eared sheet of paper and read Liverpool. When she saw my tears as she finished, she signed the paper and gave it to me. Duffy had given the poem to the Liverpool Echo, so it would be owned by the city; it was the paper\u2019s editor who read it at the ceremony. How did it feel to hear those words? \u201cThe first thing I felt was huge emotion for the families. It was an amazing ceremony that the city of Liverpool gave \u2013 the huge dignity of all the people either on the stage or in the crowd. I was just so proud that they\u2019d used my poem, really proud and grateful.\u201d    Poetry is who we are in words. It talks across differences. The idea that a poet is a dead white man is risible now  Carol Ann Duffy     Liverpool is a city very close to her heart (she is still a Liverpool FC fan). \u201cIt was where I began as a writer,\u201d she says, and she lived there for a decade or so, both as a student and as the partner of the celebrated Liverpool poet Adrian Henri. As a child, she had lived in Stafford, and recalls that early fever of childhood reading. \u201cBecause I had a Christmas birthday, I would get double book tokens, Christmas and birthday, so when I wasn\u2019t going to the local library \u2013 daily I went there, on my bicycle \u2013 I was saving up my book tokens and going to the bookshop. I knew the people in that bookshop from when I was eight to when I was 18.\u201d     Being poet laureate, Duffy says, is \u2018almost entirely a joy\u2019. Photograph: Thomas Butler for the Guardian    Now, she lives in the Manchester suburb of Didsbury, where she looks after her daughter Ella\u2019s two spaniels, Lola and Scrumpy, while Ella is finishing her degree in English, education and drama at Cambridge. (Ella, who has wanted to work in the theatre since she was about 13, is unlikely to follow in her mother\u2019s footsteps.) Duffy is more than happy to be the public face of poetry; far less so to be a \u201ccelebrity\u201d, which she avoids by retreating home between engagements and pottering in the garden. She steers clear of social media. \u201cI think poetry\u2019s the opposite of that. And obviously, people who go to poetry are far fewer than the people who go to Facebook and Twitter. But I think poetry is a unifying art, a way of talking across differences. The idea that a poet is a dead white man is risible now.\u201d Duffy is also a professor at the Manchester Writing School. Has she felt the impact of the current vogue for \u201cno platforming\u201d controversial speakers? No, she says. \u201cMost people are good people, aren\u2019t they? Your own humanity, your own common sense, should guide you to the difference between deliberate offence and free speech.\u201d Duffy has perhaps done more than any other poet to demystify contemporary poetry \u2013 her work is at once easy to understand and filled with emotional profundity. But she is also unafraid of laughter and informality, particularly when it comes to children, remembering the time when a little boy asked her, at the end of a talk, whether she had \u201ca poem about a balloon, at all\u201d. She wrote one on the blackboard for him. She has three years of laureateship left: has she begun to assess what the experience has meant, or to envisage a life afterwards? \u201cI\u2019m quite a live-in-the-moment person,\u201d she says, \u201cso I think it\u2019s going to have to be after the 10 years that I look back. But it\u2019s almost entirely a joy.\u201d She has taken particular pleasure in the variety of opportunities and collaborations: she\u2019s just back from performing to 10-year-olds in Ireland; has recently written a libretto for composer Sally Beamish\u2019s Shakespeare Odes; and is writing another for the Durham Hymns, to be performed in the cathedral there in July, not long after she sets her suitcase down from this tour. *** Before the poets set off, I press them on what they hope their road trip will achieve. Kay points to the different places that poetry can find its home \u2013 at festivals such as Latitude and Glastonbury, even at football grounds: she read an anti-racist poem at Sheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane back in 2012; as she said at the time, \u201ca poet on the pitch, but not a pitch-perfect poet\u201d. Poetry, Duffy agrees, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to show its passport\u201d.     Gillian Clarke: \u2018biggest show-off\u2019 on the tour, Duffy says. Photograph: Geraint Lewis/Rex Shutterstock    Kay tells a very moving story about her own experience of the power of words. \u201cI went and saw my birth mother recently [She was adopted as a baby], who\u2019s got vascular dementia and lost all her ability to speak. And she hadn\u2019t spoken at all for three months and I couldn\u2019t think what to do to communicate. So I read her a poem in Scottish, because she\u2019s from the Highlands, and at the end, she grabbed hold of my hands and said, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d Kay ascribes that connective quality to the recognition of rhythms, repetitions and word-sounds buried deep in our brain, all of which can survive the loss of more overt comprehension. \u201cPoetry is who we are in words,\u201d Duffy says. But who we are also includes fun and celebration. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly allowed to be silly,\u201d Dharker says. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to go out and imagine ourselves as a rock band.\u201d Who\u2019s the best performer? \u201cGillian\u2019s the biggest show-off,\u201d Duffy says. (\u201cWho needs enemies?\u201d Clarke responds.) There is, I remind them, a noble tradition of bands splitting up while on tour \u2013 even on stage. Any danger of that? \u201cI might just go my own way,\u201d Kay says. \u201cJump off the bus. Have a massive tantrum.\u201d \u201cHas anyone got Kate Tempest\u2019s number?\u201d Duffy asks. \u2022 The Shore to Shore poets tour runs from 19 June to 2 July; for details, go to carolannduffyandfriends.com.  A poem by Gillian Clarke In A Cardiff Arcade, 1952One of those little shops too smallfor the worlds they hold, where wordsthat sing you to sleep, storiesthat stalk your dreams,open like golden windows in a wall. One small room leads to another,the first bright-windowed on the street,alluring, luminous. The other is dusk,walled with pressed pages, old bookswith leathery breath and freckled leaves. What stays is not the book alonebut where you took it down,how it felt in your hands,how she wrapped it in brown paper,how you carried it home, how it holds wild seasthat knock the earth apart,how words burn, freeze,to break and heal your heart. \u2022 Taken from Off The Shelf: A Celebration Of Bookshops In Verse, edited by Carol Ann Duffy and published by Picador at \u00a310.
