  "body": "When Donald Trump warns that the United States is threatened by a marauding wave of pitiless Latin Americans, he may well be right. At least, that\u2019s the message of a viral advert for the upcoming 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica, which has been released by an Argentinian TV channel. The advert for the special 100-year anniversary edition of the soccer tournament, to be held in the US, intercuts extracts from Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cwall\u201d speech with footage of Argentina\u2019s national team.   Related: The fall: how diving became football\u2019s worst crime | Alejandro Chacoff    \u201cThese are total killers,\u201d says Trump, as the video shows \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda lashing the ball into the back of the net. As Trump continues, \u201cthese are not the nice, sweet little people that you think,\u201d the video cuts to a closeup of Barcelona wizard Lionel Messi giving a menacing sneer to his opponents. In a powerful send-up of his proposed measures to exclude migrants, Trump\u2019s rhetoric is dubbed over footage of an unstoppable football team \u2013 and their devoted fans. The Republican frontrunner\u2019s grim warnings that \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d are coming from South America and spreading across the US, are played out over footage of Argentinian fans dressed in the white-and-blue colors of the national team, from \u201ccoming through the border\u201d to see their team play at the matches to be held in Seattle, Houston and Los Angeles, among other cities in the US. Other Argentinian soccer stars such as Sergio Ag\u00fcero (Manchester City), Javier Pastore (Paris Saint-Germain) and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn (Napoli) are seen running on the field as Trump warns: \u201cWe have no protection.\u201d The ad, meant to attract viewers to watch the matches on Argentina\u2019s TyC Sports network, ends with a cautionary legend spelled out in Spanish on the screen: \u201cIn truth, the best that they can do is not let us in.\u201d This year\u2019s edition of the Copa Am\u00e9rica marks the centenary of the South American soccer championship. It begins on 3 June.",
