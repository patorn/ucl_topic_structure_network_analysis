Related: Alicia Vikander to play Lara Croft in Tomb Raider reboot    The outfit, named Vikarious Productions, will be led by the Swedish actor and her London-based agent Charles Collier, according to Variety. The company\u2019s first film, Euphoria, is set to start shooting this autumn in the German Alps, with Vikander and Eva Green starring as duelling sisters travelling through Europe. The film marks the English-language debut of Swedish film-maker Lisa Langseth, who previously directed Vikander in Pure and Hotel. Vikander, who won an Oscar for The Danish Girl, said of the project: \u201cIt is a profound story about the journey of two estranged sisters, full of suffering but also full of joy, and squaring up to very important subject matter. It also has compelling female voices and is packed to the rafters with female talent both sides of the camera.\u201d Variety reports that the company plans to produce a further two titles within the next two years. As an actor, Vikander has three films due for release this year: the historical drama Tulip Fever; a romantic picture with Michael Fassbender, The Light Between Oceans; and this summer\u2019s Jason Bourne. News of Vikarious forming comes shortly after Jessica Chastain launched her own production company, Freckle Films, where she will serve as president. Vikander and Chastain join a line of other female actors who\u2019ve formed production companies with varying degrees of success.

Others, like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Katherine Heigl, used their outfits to launch TV vehicles for themselves. Drew Barrymore has been busy since 1999 heading Flower Films, with a slew of successes including the two Charlie\u2019s Angels films, Donnie Darko and romantic comedies 50 First Dates and How to Be Single. Reese Witherspoon, meanwhile, had a banner year in 2014, after seeing her company, Pacific Standard, score major hits with both Gone Girl and Wild.",
