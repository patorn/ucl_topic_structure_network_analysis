  "body": "Louise Doughty was born in the East Midlands in 1963. She took an MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia and has written eight novels, including her latest, Black Water, which is published by Faber on 2 June. Black Water is your eighth novel, and is set in Bali, a place you\u2019d never been to until a few years ago. Why are your books always changing direction?I\u2019ve realised over the years that I\u2019m just no good at thinking strategically as a novelist. I never think, oh this did really well, I\u2019ll do it again. I\u2019m much more likely to think, oh this did really well, let\u2019s do something completely different now. And it is very different from the two novels that preceded it, Whatever You Love and Apple Tree Yard\u2026They were both female first-person narratives, with a lot in the present tense, so they were very immediate. They were also very much about women\u2019s preoccupations at certain stages in life: so Whatever You Love, having children, Apple Tree Yard, being a middle-aged woman having knee tremblers in parliament. I think I just really needed to do something in a different tone of voice.   Related: Apple Tree Yard by Louise Doughty \u2013 review    So, how did Black Water take shape?I was at the Ubud literary festival on Bali in 2012, and I had terrible jet lag. And also I was probably drinking one too many cocktails at the festival parties. I was lying awake every night, and the night-time in rural Indonesia is very noisy \u2013 geckoes on the roof, monkeys, cicadas, insects, monsoon rain. So I was awake a lot, listening to the noises, and a really strong image came to me of a man lying awake at night in a hut in Indonesia, mortally afraid. Why is he so afraid?In the opening pages, he decides that men with machetes are going to come and kill him. But I didn\u2019t actually know who he was, I didn\u2019t know how old he was, I didn\u2019t know why he was there. But what I did know about him was that what he was afraid of wasn\u2019t what was going to happen; he was afraid of something that he himself had done. The novel goes into the history of Indonesia, and in particular the massacres of communists and suspected communists in 1965. And your character, Harper, is deeply implicated, isn\u2019t he?Of course, he\u2019s a metaphor for Indonesia itself. Because a military dictator came to power in 1965, there was never any truth and reconciliation, there was never any coming to terms with this massacre. It\u2019s still very difficult to talk about 1965. Nobody would say, for many years, if their father had been killed in \u201965, because any family association with a communist, you would lose your job, it was dangerous. And also, in a lot of places, it was whole families that were killed.    I thought Apple Tree Yard was a feminist indictment of criminal justice    Your earliest novels, Crazy Paving and Dance With Me, got mixed in with \u201cchicklit\u201d. How did that feel?Crazy Paving is about urban terrorism and chaos theory \u2013 but it had single women running around London as its heroines. Dance With Me was about mental illness and sexual betrayal and ghosts, but it had a single woman, who was promiscuous, as the main character. So there was this awful phase \u2013 and thank heavens it\u2019s gone \u2013 where no young woman could write about what it was like to be a young woman in any style whatsoever without being lumped in that bracket. Your novel Fires in the Dark was, again, very different.I was always going to write that book. That was my Holocaust novel, and that was about a group of nomadic Kalderash Roma in central Europe in 1927; they go through the great depression, the rise of Nazism, the second world war \u2013 and then it ends with the Prague uprising, May 1945. My family left central Europe in the mid-19th century, possibly earlier, so that wasn\u2019t what had happened to our family, but it was what might have happened if we had stayed. Apple Tree Yard really caught people\u2019s imagination \u2013 and now it\u2019s becoming a TV series, with Emily Watson in the lead. Did you intend to write a thriller?Well, the weird thing is, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m writing thrillers, but quite a lot of other people seem to. I thought Apple Tree Yard was a feminist indictment of criminal justice, and an explanation of a middle-aged woman who [whispers] has sex. So, the big question is \u2013 will the next book be yet another dramatic change?I don\u2019t know how to do it any other way. I\u2019m just not capable of it. I can only write whatever idea grips my by the throat and holds me against the wall, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done so far, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to keep doing. I don\u2019t think I can write cynically. Black Water is published by Faber (\u00a312.99). Click here to buy it for \u00a310.39",
