Analysts have been scrutinizing remarks by all Federal Reserve officials over the past few months for a hunt of when the next interest rate hike might occur. The US central bank is expected to announce two to three interest rate hikes this year after it increased rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.    Interest rates US Federal Reserve   \u201cI have been told that a bunch of money managers in New York have delayed their trip to the Hamptons this afternoon, so that they could listen to you talk here today in case you move markets,\u201d Greg Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University, told Yellen to laughter from audience. \u201cSo this is your chance to move markets. Do you want to tell us anything about the monetary policy going forward?\u201d \u201cLet me say a few sentences so I won\u2019t delay them very long,\u201d said Yellen, to more laughter. She pointed out that the economy is continuing to improve despite the weak growth reported in the first quarter.  On Friday morning, hours before Yellen\u2019s Q&A session, the US commerce department revised up its gross domestic product figured for the first quarter. US GDP \u2013 the broadest measure of the health of the economy \u2013 rose at 0.8% instead of the 0.5% reported last month. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently estimating second-quarter GDP rising at a 2.9% rate.    Related: Interest rates could rise as soon as June, Federal Reserve suggests    Yellen, too, said that she expects GDP to pick up and the labor market to continue to improve. The Fed will continue to monitor incoming data and will asses the risks to the outlook, she said. While she did not mention what those risks are, the Fed had previously focused on risks posed by Britain\u2019s potential exit from the European Union, \u201cBrexit\u201d, and by the lingering uncertainty over China\u2019s economy.  Yellen also pointed out that the unemployment rate is nearing full employment, labor participation has increased in the past few months, and that oil prices and dollar depreciation, which can influence inflation, have both stabilized.  \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate \u2013 and I have said this in the past, I think \u2013 for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time,\u201d said Yellen, adding: \u201cProbably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate.\u201d A day before Yellen\u2019s speech, Jerome Powell, a Federal Reserve governor who is a voting members of the Fed\u2019s policy setting committee, said that the economy is on a \u201csolid footing\u201d but that he has not yet decided whether he will support raising interest rates when the Fed meets on 14-15 June. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wait too long, but neither do you want to be in a hurry,\u201d he explained, adding that the risks of waiting to raise rates were \u201cnot that great\u201d.  Yellen has previously warned that waiting to raise interest rates too long might lead to inflation bubbling over.  If there is too much uncertainty mid-June about whether to raise interest rates \u2013 due to Brexit vote or other economic data, the Fed is scheduled to meet again six week later in July, John William, San Francisco Fed President, pointed out earlier this month.  Yellen also warned against raising interest rates too steeply on Friday, noting that the Fed has limited tools to respond to another economic crisis.  \u201cIf we were to raise interest rates too steeply and we were to trigger a downturn, we have limited scope for responding and this is an important reason for caution,\u201d she said.",
