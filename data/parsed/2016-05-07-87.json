Rees, who describes himself as the mixed-race son of a white single mother, sees parallels between his victory in Bristol on Saturday and Sadiq Khan\u2019s triumph in London. Both are from modest backgrounds and have risen to high office through the Labour party. Corbyn is expected to visit Bristol this evening to congratulate Rees on the victory, in which Rees earned 68,750 votes to Ferguson\u2019s 39,577. The Labour leader did not attend Khan\u2019s signing-in ceremony as London mayor. When asked why, Khan said: \u201cIt is an open invite, I\u2019m not sure what Jeremy was doing today, we\u2019ll have to find out what he was doing. There are Labour MPs here, there were MPs of all parties here. In his victory speech Rees described his tough beginnings, where he said he was a rare \u201cbrown\u201d face on a Bristol housing estate. He said creating a \u201cfairer, more inclusive\u201d society was his reason for entering politics. He added that he would be \u201ctransparent, inclusive, sharing power and empowering\u201d. A father of three, he also said he was determined to make time for his family. Ferguson, the outgoing mayor, was heckled as he gave his concession speech, prompting him to warn Rees that would have to endure \u201cbarracking and bile\u201d during his tenure. He said he had laid good foundations, which he hoped Rees would build on. An architect, entrepreneur and wearer of bright red trousers, Ferguson caused something of an upset in 2012 when he won the mayoral race.

It was the European green capital last year, and the independent had audiences with the pope and Ban Ki-moon. More prosaically, he has created controversial residents\u2019 parking schemes and 20mph zones. Rees came into politics via Operation Black Vote. It was a bitter blow for Rees and Labour when he was beaten by Ferguson last time. Rees has argued that Ferguson has been good for the well-off in Bristol but bad for the less wealthy. Housing has been one of the big issues of the election, due to rising house prices, rents and an increase in homelessness. In the final days of the campaign both Ferguson and Rees accused each other of being the establishment. Rees said Ferguson was a member of a wealthy elite group that had controlled Bristol for decades. Ferguson said Labour was the political establishment in Bristol and suggested that if Rees won power he would put the party before the city.  Before election day, Rees flagged up parallels between him and London\u2019s new mayor, Sadiq Khan, and said neither would have been able to stand were it not for Labour. He told the Guardian: \u201cI think the Bristol election is important to national Labour. In myself and Sadiq you see evidence of the fact that Labour offers real political change. Look at our backgrounds. Sadiq is the son of a bus driver, I\u2019m the mixed race son of a single white woman who spent time in a refuge. The support of the Labour party has enabled myself and Sadiq to try to become mayors of two world cities. I think that matters politically.\u201d",
