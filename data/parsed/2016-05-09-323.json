  "body": "Three years ago Gillian Ussher quit a job she hated to make a living drawing portraits of animals. The move meant she could spend more time at home with her baby, and also pursue her passion \u2013 something which until then had only been a hobby. But while she was successful in selling her art, managing her cash flow was a battle. \u201cIt was a bit of a disaster,\u201d she admits. \u201cI used to celebrate every sale by going out for a pizza and spending 50% of what we made.\u201d  Living on loans for the first two years, she adds: \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust that at the end of the month I would have enough income to pay the mortgage or bills. I really found myself in a state of panic which also affected my work.\u201d Not having a separate bank account for the business meant that she was using her company\u2019s money for personal expenses, leaving her very little to invest in important areas such as marketing or advertising. It was stunting the business\u2019s growth. So, after two years of financial chaos she opened an additional account and now feels in control of her venture\u2019s money. She set up standing orders to pay herself a weekly wage out of the business account and, while personal budgets took a hit, she believes sacrificing luxuries such as holidays is a worthwhile investment in a company that will hopefully continue to flourish. Much of her initial money woes could have been avoided, Ussher says, if she had invested more cash into the business from the start. The artist launched herself with just \u00a3200 in her pocket and regrets not having saved more. Having a lump sum is a huge help at the beginning because, she warns, \u201chowever much I thought things would cost, it cost five times more\u201d.   Related: Late payment dispute is ruining my health and crucifying cash flow    Patricia van den Akker, director of The Design Trust, says that, since commissions for work can be sporadic and unpredictable, it\u2019s not uncommon for sole traders and freelancers in the creative industries to struggle with cash flow.  She agrees that starting out with enough savings to keep you afloat during the first turbulent years of business will make life easier \u2013 and suggests having about three months\u2019 worth of living and business costs set aside as a buffer during quieter periods.  Akker also advises asking the bank for an overdraft before you need it. If you are already in the red, she says, no bank is going to consider helping you. Having a safety net will give you the confidence to concentrate on driving your business forward to success and avoid the stress that can stifle creativity. It\u2019s also important to save for your tax return, which is due to be filed at the end of January every year. Akker says it is a good idea to start doing your tax accounts over the summer, in plenty of time for the deadline.  Niki Groom, a fashion illustrator and designer, says she always puts away 20% of every payment she receives as tax and is careful never to dip into it.  The founder of Miss Magpie Fashion Spy, Groom also budgets enough money to pay herself a wage from the business account, but insists it is no more than the bare minimum to get through the month. If she notices that there is a healthy amount of funds building up, she may use some of that cash to pay for a well-deserved break. \u201cSometimes I think that spending it on yourself to have a holiday is looking after the most important thing in the business \u2013 you and your brain,\u201d she says. \u201cI really love doing the work, but I understand it\u2019s important to take a break some time. Your personal wellbeing is as important as making money.\u201d But if you simply don\u2019t have a head for numbers, is an accountant a good investment?  Sarah Thirtle, head of business lending at Creative United, says there are more affordable ways to keep on top of your cash flow than hiring a professional. She recommends accountancy tools such as Xero and QuickBooks which can help people visualise what money coming in and out of their business looks like. Taking a basic business accounting course is also worth looking into.    Related: Tax plans to bind small firms with more red tape? No thanks    Genevieve Pace, Creative United\u2019s programme manager for business lending, adds that whatever business you have, it is always helpful to have someone, whether it\u2019s an adviser, mentor or coach, to speak to confidentially.  Thirtle adds that it is crucial to demystify the perception that managing your cash flow is \u201cexcruciatingly difficult and endless drudgery\u201d.  \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t have to be,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt can actually be really powerful to be in a position where you know what money is coming in and coming out. If that can help you make decisions about the best kind of work to create that is going to help you have a sustainable career as an artist, then that is worth taking the time to figure out.\u201d Groom, who left a full-time position as a senior designer to became a sole trader six years ago, says giving up the security of a permanent job was a leap into the unknown and continues to be a challenge \u2013 but it is possible to forge a successful career as a freelancer. \u201cWhen I read things about how creatives make it on their own, often there is family money or a rich partner behind their success,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when money is not coming in and there is nothing else to rely on except loans, it can be quite easy to think it\u2019s not fair. \u201cI am on my own and completely responsible for my finances but recently bought my first place at the age of 39. So I think it\u2019s encouraging for younger graduates to remember that it is possible.\u201d Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.",
