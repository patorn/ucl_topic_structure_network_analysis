  "body": "\u2018Scary, intimidating. Are these the words we want to be using to describe how our kids are using technology?\u201d asks the ever-enthralling Aleks Krotoski in Changeling. Previous episodes of Radio 4\u2019s absorbing Digital Human series have focused on taste, body and mind and they\u2019re all worth a listen. Now, talk turns to the contentious issue of children being better at using technology than their parents. Krotoski always brings out the human emotion behind the digital story and she has no problem firing up the most paranoid part of a parent\u2019s brain with this debate. That moment when you realise your child can unlock your tablet also unlocks peace and quiet, but what happens when the terror of your three-year-old overtaking your technical skills kicks in? Big questions are asked: if these devices aren\u2019t real, does that mean the people using them aren\u2019t feeling real emotions? Surely anyone who has ever witnessed the glee a child experiences watching Disney figures being unboxed on YouTube would beg to differ. Some of the theories touted seem a bit far-fetched, unless of course your concern over your toddler being able to swipe really does mask your fear of children. Beware, these little creatures have the power to make you obsolete one day. Grim existential thinking aside, Krotoski illustrates that technology is changing so quickly it\u2019s impossible for the older generation to keep up. Is Snapchat that much different from swapping notes in class? The fear that parents can\u2019t give their children the benefit of their experience if they\u2019re not exactly sure what it is they\u2019re doing is real. How parenting has changed in the last 10 years is perfectly summed up by one dad of a toddler, who once had grand plans to \u201cread him stories and sing him songs\u201d. Then reality set in. \u201cI think after about two weeks we realised it wasn\u2019t going to be remotely possible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt very quickly drains your sanity.\u201d Busy lives leave little time for Baa-Baa-Blacksheeping, but the guilt lies heavy. Alicia Blum-Ross touches on how the no-screen rule is touted in the same way as the breastfeeding debate: stick to it and your child will be OK. But with screen-time being such a big part of modern life, maybe it\u2019s time to bend the rules.",
