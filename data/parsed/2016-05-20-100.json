  "body": "The surgeon who operated on David Ginola has said that the former France winger \u201calmost died\u201d after having a heart attack while playing football. Professor Gilles Dreyfus told The Associated Press on Friday that Ginola was in good condition a day after undergoing a quadruple heart bypass operation and was expected to make a full recovery. The 49-year-old was airlifted to the Monaco cardiothoracic center on Thursday after collapsing on the field in the Riviera town of Mandelieu. Dreyfus said he would remain in the hospital for about 10 days. \u201cHe was incredibly lucky,\u201d Dreyfus said. \u201cHe was fortunate to receive a heart massage immediately, and that was essential in preventing brain damage. Emergency services arrived on site eight minutes later. There is a set of factors that saved his life.\u201d Dreyfus said Ginola suffered the symptoms of a heart ventricular fibrillation and was diagnosed with \u201cextremely severe lesions\u201d when he arrived at the hospital. The surgery lasted five hours. Dreyfus, who also performed surgery on French actor Gerard Depardieu earlier in his career, said Ginola has regained consciousness and does not need any medication. \u201cHe almost died but and will be able to lead a normal life,\u201d he said.
