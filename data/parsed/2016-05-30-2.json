  "body": "One upside to new Senate voting rules is that they have driven a micro-party alliance giving rise to Australia\u2019s first apparently irresistible political platform: sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. Well, sex and drugs anyway. The Australian Sex party and the Marijuana (Hemp) party \u2013 in a liaison aimed at corralling the progressive end of the minor party vote \u2013 are running their \u201cjoint ticket\u201d in all states and territories except New South Wales and Victoria, where they will preference each other. Still, Fiona Patten, whose role as an MP in the Victorian state upper house gives the Sex party real skin in the political game, notes the party\u2019s previous teamwork with Gotye\u2019s Basics Rock\u2019n\u2019roll party. \u201cWe\u2019ve got strong arts policies and we certainly support rock\u2019n\u2019roll,\u201d she says.   Related: Campaign catchup: what if no one wins the election?    Patten is no more inclined to talk down the idea of the dream platform than to discourage the inexhaustible supply of double entendres that can be read into talk of plans to stimulate certain industries, take the progressive vote higher and so on. \u201cThe Sex party and HEMP come together on that issue,\u201d she says. Is that another one or is this some kind of Freudian game?  Blue frivolity aside, the platform led by the Sex party shows an organisation that has evolved beyond a lobby group for the sex industry and anti-censorship movement into one that embraces the full range of progressive voter concerns without the Labor party\u2019s burden of having to temper its pitch for the swinging centre (not that kind of swinging). It has a leader in Patten who will not shy away from press releases such as the one on Monday in which she tells anti-Islam protesters at a Coburg shopping centre: \u201cTake your messages of hate \u2013 and piss off!\u201d The Sex party occupies a vacuum left by mainstream party inaction on legal reforms with not insignificant popular support, from euthanasia to abortion, marriage equality, legal aid access and prison reform, humane processing of asylum seekers and medical and recreational cannabis. All of which may sound familiar to Greens supporters (not that kind of green). Where the Greens and the Sex party essentially differ, according to Patten, is in tax matters, a function of the latter\u2019s roots in essentially being a small business lobby group. It is also displeased with the Greens\u2019 role in teaming with the Liberals to change Senate voting rules in a manner likely to see the drying up of preference swaps that previously propelled micro-party candidates into office. It is likely to withhold its preferences from the Greens in various theatres, which could be a boon to Labor. The Sex and Hemp coalition candidates are not to be trifled with. In NSW the Sex party lead candidate is Ross Fitzgerald, a prominent historian and former politics professor who coauthored an official history of Queensland and sat on parole boards in two states. Meredith Doig, a serial corporate and educational board member and former Rio Tinto and Ford manager, is perhaps the party\u2019s best chance of a Senate seat, running in Victoria.    On all these issues the church is interfering with our secular lives and basically telling us what we should do  Robin Bristow     Robin Bristow, the lead Senate candidate for Queensland, is a successful Noosa architect and LGBTI rights activist, who took part in the first gay pride march in his native South Africa. Michael Harding, the Hemp Queensland Senate candidate, No 2 on the ticket, is an army veteran who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing atrocities in Afghanistan. Harding, who spent two years on pharmaceuticals for PTSD, is an advocate for medicinal cannabis as an alternative after researching its use in US states like Colorado at the instigation of veterans\u2019 groups. Asked about the prospects of edging out Australia\u2019s darling of the far right, Pauline Hanson, in the Senate, Bristow says the main focus of the Sex party/Hemp campaign is an unresolved issue that, according to one Ipsos poll at least, has far greater traction with voters: taxing the churches. With multinational tax avoidance on the political radar, the Sex/Hemp ticket point a finger at churches as \u201cthe far bigger tax avoider living in every suburb and small town in Queensland\u201d.

Photograph: David Mildren    They say the tax-free status of church activities that come under the banner of \u201cadvancing religion\u201d \u2013 from property deals to share trading, poker machine income, wineries, insurance companies, hotels and breakfast cereal companies \u2013 should apply only to explicitly charitable works. Plenty seem to agree.  Bristow says taxing churches has \u201c64% support from the general population, so I think that\u2019s going to be a lot higher than Pauline\u2019s support base\u201d. He notes Scott Morrison, the federal treasurer, is a regular worshipper at the Pentecostal Hillsong church, which along with the Seventh Day Adventists and the Catholic church, are \u201call allowed to compete on an unlevel playing field with their business empires just because the treasurer and the government of the day support the notion that anyone who \u2018promotes religion\u2019 is entitled not to pay tax\u201d. Bristow says the rub with this \u201cincredible rort\u201d comes when those churches seek to exert influence in government on marriage equality, abortion laws, and sex and gender issues education in schools.  \u201cOn all these issues the church is interfering with our secular lives and basically telling us what we should do,\u201d he says.  \u201cQueensland has the worst sex education in Australia and this is the results of that.\u201d A bit of payroll tax, fringe benefits tax and council rates \u2013 and by a bit they mean a billion dollars or more worth a year \u2013 are fair enough to expect in return, the Sex party argues. As if that is not enough of a shot over the bows of traditional moral guardians, there is the unashamed call for drug law reform which recognises the right of pot smokers to be treated in the same way as the nation\u2019s drinkers. In a campaign where Greens senators, by calling for policies advocated by no less a mainstream figure than former Australian federal police commander Mick Palmer, end up being photoshopped on newspaper front pages with ice pipes, there appears little point in a party like Hemp pulling its punches.    I\u2019m getting approached by people in their 80s who are saying I\u2019m voting for Sex party  Fiona Patten     Hemp spokesman Andrew Kavasilas obliges, arguing in colourful terms that Australia would be a better place if more people smoked pot instead of drinking. \u201cIf marijuana were to replace alcohol as the major social tonic in society, there would be less aggression on the streets, lower road tolls, less domestic violence, better sleeping patterns, more creative work output and less vomit on the streets,\u201d Kavasilas says. Cannabis law reform is becoming a more crowded space this election. The one-time \u201chuman headline\u201d and broadcaster Derryn Hinch is calling for it with his \u201cDerryn Hinch Justice Party\u201d, which is gunning to unseat Ricky Muir for a Victorian Senate spot.  And Greg Chipp, son of Democrats founder Don Chipp, is also running for the Senate in Victoria for his Drug Law Reform Australia party \u2013 even using a cannabis leaf logo, much to the chagrin of the longer-standing Hemp. Patten, who returned last month from Oregon in the US where \u201cthe sky has not fallen in\u201d because of its legal cannabis industry, says the real model to watch will be California, which will have learnt from the early adopters\u2019 mistakes (chiefly taxation scope) when it legalises the industry later this year. The biggest domino to fall in an anti-prohibition push across the US will have some Australian observers wondering if or when it will make it to these shores. Patten says for Australia to follow by legalising, regulating and taxing our largest black market, is \u201cnot inevitable but the most sensible approach\u201d to a reported $5bn industry which currently \u201cjust puts money into the hands of crime gangs\u201d. \u201cEvery single ex member of parliament I speak to says, it\u2019s just ridiculous, the war on drugs, we should just legalise it, tax it, regulate it,\u201d she says. \u201cPrivately, I get a lot of support in parliament but they\u2019re all too risk averse, they\u2019re all scared. Again, it\u2019s actually more likely to be religious organisations that are calling to ban it. \u201cI\u2019m not a conspiracy theorist but if you were to legalise it, you may put a dent in big pharma, you may put dent in the alcohol industry, so I worry if there\u2019s pressure for those industries to stop the tide. \u201cIf you have a Sex Party/Hemp senator, you can be certain it\u2019s on the agenda.\u201d Australian states have only recently begun moving on medical cannabis, which Hemp has advocated for decades ago.   Related: Deal and no deal: decoding Turnbull and Shorten's double talk on minority rule | Lenore Taylor    Patten says the sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll platform predictably will attract a portion of the youth vote. But she says support seems be increasing among early baby boomers who are nudging their 70s, and some even older. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve also had a very strong stance on euthanasia, I must say I\u2019m getting approached by people in their 80s who are saying I\u2019m voting for Sex party,\u201d Patten says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re also the people who want access to medicinal marijuana. \u201cIt\u2019s the women who wear purple, who say I don\u2019t give a shit, who fought for reproductive rights and the right of women to drink in the front bar. \u201cIt\u2019s the independently minded baby boomer who is looking at their own mortality \u2013 also, is probably quite familiar with marijuana, so the fear campaigns are not running through for them.\u201d If more of these people, who could be dubbed the dying-with-dignity-but-growing-old-disgracefully crowd, materialise, the grey vote may never look the same.",
