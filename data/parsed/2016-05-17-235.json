EU institutions have so far avoided getting drawn into the UK\u2019s increasingly bitter referendum campaign, but Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said on Tuesday that he had to respond when he heard the EU being compared to the Nazi leader\u2019s plans.   Guardian explained: Current referendum polling   He said: \u201cWhen I hear the EU being compared to the plans and projects of Adolf Hitler I cannot remain silent. Such absurd arguments should be completely ignored if they hadn\u2019t been formulated by one of the most influential politicians in the [UK\u2019s] ruling party. \u201cBoris Johnson crossed the boundaries of a rational discourse, demonstrating political amnesia.\u201d These views were in the minds of many Europeans, not just Britons, Tusk added, but this was no excuse for Johnson\u2019s \u201cdangerous blackout\u201d. The former London mayor, seen as a leading figure in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU, caused outrage when he drew a comparison between the EU and Nazi subjugation of Europe.     When EU compared to plans and projects of Adolf Hitler I cannot remain silent.

Johnson stood by his comments on Monday, describing the reaction as an \u201cartificial media twit storm\u201d. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, chairs summits of EU leaders and was one of the architects of Britain\u2019s \u201cspecial status\u201d deal with the EU, secured by David Cameron in February.   Related: German politicians criticise Boris Johnson for EU-Hitler comments    Tusk rejected the arguments often made by Brexit campaigners by saying the EU was a common tool, not a superstate. \u201cEuropean countries would have to face the migration crisis, an aggressive Russia and economic uncertainty alone without the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we have to finally begin to remind ourselves of this banal, and perhaps boring truth: the only alternative [to the EU] is political chaos, the return to national egoisms, and in consequence, the triumph of anti-democratic tendencies, which can lead to history repeating itself.\u201d Johnson\u2019s remarks also triggered disbelief in Germany. A spokesman for the Social Democratic party (SPD), told the Guardian he was \u201cspeechless at what stupidity nationalism can trigger in seemingly intelligent people\u201d.",
