It\u2019s almost as if he doesn\u2019t want to be on television singing a song first made famous by the Dave Clark Five in the 1960s while wearing a garish red and blue shell suit. However, 26 years on and as Pardew prepares to face Manchester United in a rematch of their 1990 encounter, the much-maligned FA Cup final song is finally back in fashion. Or at least it is in south London. Palace supporters have released two unofficial efforts to accompany their team to Wembley on Saturday, with the comedian Doc Brown\u2019s Glad All Over Again paying direct homage to the class of 1990 and Red \u2019N\u2019 Blue Army by Yannick Bolasie\u2019s cousin Fearless and childhood friend Max representing a more contemporary sound.

Good Old Arsenal \u2013 featuring players such as Bob Wilson, Frank McLintock and Charlie George and composed by none other than Jimmy Hill \u2013 reached No16 in the charts that year and began a constant stream of Cup final songs over the next three decades. From West Ham\u2019s I\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles in 1975 to Ossie\u2019s Dream (Spurs are on their way to Wembley) by Chas and Dave in 1981 \u2013 best remembered for Ossie Ard\u00edles\u2019s killer line \u201cin the Cup for Tott-ing-ham\u201d \u2013 the sight of permed footballers singing their hearts out on Top of the Pops became a convention every May.

Photograph: Les Lee/Daily Express/Getty Images    It wasn\u2019t until Manchester United teamed up with Status Quo to release Come On You Reds in 1994 that an FA Cup final song hit top spot in the charts for the first time, although Liverpool\u2019s Anfield Rap six years earlier went pretty close. Yet since Cardiff City\u2019s players celebrated their achievement of reaching the final while in the Championship with the release of Bluebirds Flying High in 2008, the recording studio has been empty, aside from a few unofficial efforts. \u201cAn old friend of mine tweeted me saying: \u2018You should do a Cup final song,\u2019 but I was like: \u2018It\u2019s so cheesy\u2019,\u201d admits Brown, who started out as a rapper before moving into comedy and acting, and is the younger brother of the author Zadie Smith. \u201cI thought about approaching the club but they would probably have got me to do a rap with Yannick Bolasie or something. But I thought if it felt right to do it and was fun then why not?\u201d Like his previous effort Stop Moaning (Try Being Palace), Glad All Over Again is full of witty one-liners. In particular, Brown recognises that the line \u201cSee the spirit of Wright and Bright is back son/And Andy Gray. Not him, the cool black one\u201d will be a particular favourite of the older generation. \u201cI wanted to have a couple of lines in there for people of a certain age,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crucial to me with my music and that team was amazing. I\u2019m making a bit of a comeback as an artist and I don\u2019t want to be making grime music or the type of music that teenagers love because I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m always going to be talking about stuff that I relate to and my peers can relate to.\u201d   Related: Singing footballers: from yesteryear to Sport Relief 2014 \u2013 in pictures    The Palace chairman, Steve Parish, has endorsed Brown\u2019s effort as the club\u2019s official song on Twitter after Brown pledged to donate all proceeds to the CPFC Foundation but the players may have something to say about that. Two weeks ago Bolasie posted a video of himself on Instagram having a massage and it sparked excited rumours that the song playing in the background could be an official team song featuring their star winger on the microphone. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know anything about it until I sent it to him,\u201d Fearless says. \u201cIt was just a surprise for him. I made it after the semi-final against Watford. I\u00a0loved the atmosphere so much that I\u00a0went straight to the studio afterwards to do the track. My cousin really liked it and put it up straight on his Instagram. He doesn\u2019t take music seriously \u2013 he does it for fun.\u201d Featuring lyrics such as \u201cMy team\u2019s ready to show man/How we boss the middle like Yohan\u201d, it is definitely one for the current dressing-room generation. Proceeds from the track will go to Palace\u2019s Study Centre, although Fearless, who has featured on an N-Dubz album, is keen to play down the competition with Brown\u2019s song. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing it like that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re both carrying the same positive message about the club. The Croydon area has had a bad image over the last few years and this is about bringing people together. It\u2019s good for the community.\u201d That message also comes across in the video for Glad All Over Again, filmed before Palace\u2019s last home match, against Stoke City, by Brown, who will feature alongside Ricky Gervais in the new David Brent film, Life On The Road. \u201cI knew it was going to be lovely weather, so I brought a camera down with me and we shot the video,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was that quick \u2013 everything just happened within the space of three days. Half of the shots are just done by friends of mine who I just bumped into and it\u2019s all done with one shot. It kind of reflects the vibe of Palace. There\u2019s such a peaceful and happy-go-lucky atmosphere around the club whether we win or lose.\u201d Brown will be performing his song on BT Sport and TalkSport before Saturday\u2019s final and will then head to Wembley. Whether this represents the start of a new generation of Cup final songs, we can only dream. You can download Doc Brown and Verb T\u2019s single Glad All Over Again on Spotify or iTunes.  Red \u2018N\u2019 Blue Army (feat Max) by Fearless is also available to download here.",
