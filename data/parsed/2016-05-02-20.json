  "body": "Michael Carrick said Manchester United can still qualify for the Champions League despite the 1-1 draw with Leicester City that left Louis van Gaal\u2019s team in fifth position four points behind Manchester City. United, who have played a game fewer than City, still have to travel to Norwich City and sixth-placed West Ham United, and face Bournemouth at home. Carrick said: \u201cWe will keep playing for the top four. We will keep going. We have got the games left. We will just look to the next game and try to win that. That\u2019s the only thing we can control and that is what we have got to focus on.\u201d \u201cWe were certainly looking to win against Leicester,\u201d Carrick said. \u201cIt was an opportunity for us to build on what we had gathered over the last few weeks, so we\u2019re disappointed with a draw.   Related: Leicester City\u2019s draw with Manchester United puts Premier League title on hold    \u201cI thought we came out very well, put them under a lot of pressure and caused a lot of problems. We got a goal ahead and then their goal came out of nowhere. We are disappointed with that. It was a cheap goal to give away in the position we were in. That is hard to take but I thought we played well. The second half wasn\u2019t as good as the first 25 minutes. We\u2019re just disappointed we haven\u2019t won the game.\u201d Chris Smalling also admitted he was disappointed not to have picked up all three points against Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side but the England defender still believes there is all to play for. \u201cI thought we deserved more from the game and we all came back into the dressing room feeling disappointed. We knew how important a win would have been, so it\u2019s a big blow for us and means that we\u2019re relying on results from others more than we were before the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what those other results bring but it\u2019s a blow for our hopes. If we don\u2019t win our own games, then we\u2019re not giving ourselves a chance but we\u2019ll be aiming to take our first-half performance into the game next week [against Norwich].\u201d Leicester have defied the odds with their title challenge and Carrick said he could see why they have been successful. \u201cThey put so many numbers round the edge of the box and defend deep,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is not much space to play through but, especially early on, we played quick and caused them problems. There is the threat on the break but, all in all, I think we nullified that. It was set plays and free-kicks that was the danger for us.\u201d United supporters stayed behind to applaud Leicester on Sunday and the experienced midfielder admitted he could understand their wish to pay tribute . \u201cIt is not surprising. We have got great fans and they have shown great respect there. Fair play to them,\u201d Carrick said.",
