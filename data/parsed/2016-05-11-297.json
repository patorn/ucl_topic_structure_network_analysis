  "body": "\u2018I had to change my name and leave my country\u2019 \u201cI came over here from Russia to escape persecution for being gay. I had to change my name and leave the country \u2013 I hate the place. Everyone over there hated you if you were gay. And I was an Emo kid too. Gay and Emo; I didn\u2019t stand a chance. That\u2019s why I came to London, and I love it here. You can do anything you like.\u201d \u2018I run my own business\u2019      \u201cI\u2019m the director of a plumbing company. Sometimes it can be hard to get people to trust me because I\u2019m young, but I\u2019ve been doing this ever since I left school so I know what I\u2019m talking about. \u201cEveryone has stereotypes. I have stereotypes, you have stereotypes. I was just talking about this with my friend \u2013 when people see us, see the way we dress and hear the twang in our voice, they probably think we commit crimes for a living. But I like to walk into a room of people and surprise them. It\u2019s fun. You can\u2019t let it get you down, you\u2019ve got to carry on living your life and things will change.\u201d \u2018I nearly lost my leg\u2019      \u201cEighteen months ago I was cycling and got hit by a lorry. I went under the wheels and nearly lost my leg. I started running because I couldn\u2019t cycle any more. Now I\u2019ve just run the London Marathon.  \u201cI pulled a muscle in my leg so the last 10 miles were just run, walk, run, walk. Everyone was so supportive, cheering me along \u2013 I knew I had to get it done. To be able to run at all is incredible, but I won\u2019t do this again. Once is enough.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m writing a biography\u2019      \u201cI\u2019m writing a biography about my family. They left Somalia to move to Sweden at the beginning of the civil war, when I was two. They just got out in time, before it got really bad. I moved back for two years when I was 12 \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today if I hadn\u2019t gone back there.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m a clown\u2019       \u201cI\u2019m just on my way back from Glastonbury; I was performing as a clown. I perform all around the world but Glastonbury is special because some of my greatest friends come. It\u2019s an amazing place to connect with other performers, and I love it when a group of people becomes an audience \u2013 when they\u2019re all connected and sharing a single moment in time. Being able to make that happen feels like a great gift.\u201d \u2018I just finished Ramadan\u2019      \u201cThe week when it was really hot was the hardest, but you just have to have a lot of self-discipline to get through it. Actually, you realise that a lot of the time when you are eating you don\u2019t really need to \u2013 it\u2019s just boredom eating. And it makes you aware of how lucky we are to live in a society where there\u2019s food all around us. If we\u2019re hungry we can buy something to eat, whereas other people are genuinely starving and can\u2019t do anything about it. It definitely makes you realise what it\u2019s like to really be hungry.\u201d \u2018Older people have the most amazing stories to tell\u2019      \u201cI was in the pub talking to these older people the other week \u2013 well, I\u2019m old, but I mean really old \u2013 and they had the most amazing stories to tell. I just thought how odd it was that we\u2019re all so segregated along age lines. I don\u2019t know any older people, so I called three charities asking if they knew of any older people who might need some company. I\u2019d be happy to go to their house, they can come to my house, we can go to a park ... just to sit and talk. Older people have done things that have made history. Their stories would make the most interesting book you\u2019ve ever read.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m covered in tattoos\u2019      \u201cI\u2019m covered in tattoos. As soon as I turned 18 it was the first thing I wanted to do. I got my first one when I went to uni. None of them have any meaning behind them \u2013 all my friends get meaningful ones, but I just pick an artist I like, give them an idea and let them come up with the design. I don\u2019t worry about having tattoos when I\u2019m older. You\u2019ve got much more important things to worry about when you get old.\u201d \u2018I prayed for policemen to find my phone \u2013 and they did\u2019      \u201cI lost my phone in Richmond park tonight. It was so dark, and I was jumping up and down in the road saying \u2018someone help me find it!\u2019. Three policemen got out of a van and I told them that if they helped me I\u2019d pray for them all to get wives \u2013 and they found it.\u201d Read more at the Commute Blog Have you met a memorable stranger on your commute?
