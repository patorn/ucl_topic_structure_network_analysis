  "body": "The health department has published information claiming children will no longer be eligible for a $2.7bn dental program from 1 July, despite the government not having legislated the cut yet. In April, the government replaced the $2.7bn child dental benefits schedule with a program for adults and children, which the budget shows is worth $1.7bn over the next four years. A fact sheet on the health department\u2019s website tells parents their children will no longer be able to access the old scheme from 1 July \u201cif the parliament agrees\u201d.   Related: Cost of medical and dental care a barrier to Australians \u2013 survey    In answer to a second frequently asked question, the sheet said: \u201cThe child dental benefits schedule will close to all patients from 1 July 2016. This means that you will not be able to access the [scheme] on or after this date. The cost of any dental services provided on or after this date will need to be met by you.\u201d In estimates health officials said it was a statement of the government\u2019s intent and the presumption was the scheme would close from 1 July. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said children had an entitlement to the scheme until legislation was passed and that would not be possible because parliament would be dissolved. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond the pale the department would be advising people they can\u2019t access a service they\u2019re entitled to.\u201d Di Natale suggested the advice was particularly perverse because the government had justified changes to dental health on the basis the old scheme was under-utilised. The health department secretary, Martin Bowles, said if the abolition of the old scheme wasn\u2019t legislated the department would adjust its advice.  Bowles said the statement that children would not be eligible had to be read in context of the statement abolition of the scheme required parliament\u2019s agreement. The minister for rural health, Fiona Nash, said the advice was correct when it was written and would be reassessed when parliament was dissolved. The opposition health spokeswoman, Catherine King, said the Turnbull government had \u201cbeen caught out lying to parents\u201d about the scheme. \u201cHealth department officials [on Friday] confirmed in Senate estimates that the [old scheme] could only be abolished through legislation and that this legislation has not yet passed parliament,\u201d she said. King said given parliament would be dissolved this weekend, Labor\u2019s scheme could not now be abolished before 1 July and parents would be able to access the scheme at least until the new parliament sat later this year. King said the government\u2019s new dental scheme only provided funding for 600,000 children and adults, 400,000 fewer places than the 1 million children treated under Labor\u2019s scheme.

Ley said Labor\u2019s dental plan would remain open until 1 July and \u201cif contingencies were required, they would be addressed when the need arose\u201d. \u201cLabor should be careful throwing stones, given Bill Shorten avoided any mention of their failed child dental scheme in his budget reply,\u201d she said.",
