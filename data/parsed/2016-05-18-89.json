So desperate is the situation that television and radio stations have taken to broadcasting requests for drugs and medical supplies, and people are turning to social media to seek out life-saving medicine. \u201cWe found the heart disease drug Manidon, which my mum takes daily, using WhatsApp. We bartered the drug for four rolls of toilet paper,\u201d says Carlos Gonzalez, 35, an IT worker whose wife is expecting a baby next month.  \u201cWhen my mother sees her stock of drugs declining, she starts cutting the pills and taking half a dose. If we can\u2019t find the medicines, there\u2019s nothing we can do. We can\u2019t order over the internet because we can\u2019t transfer funds abroad. The government won\u2019t exchange our bolivars for dollars or euros. People are just riding their luck,\u201d he says. Verapimil, sold under the trade name Manidon, is listed as an essential drug by the WHO, and is only available on prescription. But empty pharmacy shelves are forcing desperate Venezuelans to seek alternative routes.  According to those who responded to a Guardian callout, many people are reliant on the generosity of those living outside the country to buy drugs on their behalf, but this is dependent on having the right contacts. \u201cTo find medicines abroad is like a quest. In Spain, if pharmacies know the medication is for Venezuela, they will sell you the medication without a prescription. We must rely on friends or family to then bring it over because we are not allowed to receive anything from abroad using DHL or the post,\u201d says Rosa, 43, an administrator from Caracas, the capital. \u201cAs many Venezuelan doctors have emigrated to the US, we have some contacts there and these doctors will issue a prescription to a pharmacy directly. The pharmacy posts to a US address then that person brings the medicines to Venezuela. We then need to pay with dollars oreuros bought on the black market as we don\u2019t have free currency exchange in the country.  \u201cMy 75-year-old mother cannot live without Diovan for high blood pressure and Lumigan eye drops for glaucoma. I have also a brother that suffers from Crohn\u2019s disease. It is painful to see him suffering for long periods until finally he can get his medication. We are dependent on the goodwill of people who have family or friends abroad to send us the drugs,\u201d she says. Carla, who lives in Washington DC, uses a friend in Colombia to buy and deliver thyroid and glaucoma medication for her parents living in Caracas. \u201cMy father is diabetic and must inject insulin every day. He\u2019ll run out of his current stock in less than a month. We\u2019re planning to send my brother overseas to get insulin for my dad who is 70 and can\u2019t travel long distances. \u201cMy mother suffers from a heart arrhythmia and must take medication daily. Her doctor has changed it five times over the past six months so she can try to find at least one kind that helps her condition. She takes whatever she can find but its not the ideal medication she requires,\u201d she says.  Doctors, aware of the lack of drugs, write out multiple prescriptions for alternative drugs in case the preferred medicine is unavailable, according to some of those who responded to the Guardian\u2019s callout. Hospitals are also functioning with a lack of basic medical equipment, with reports of patients being asked to bring syringes and bandages with them. \u201cWe have less and less each day. Our medical practices have changed. It\u2019s crazy. There is not enough income to keep up with our normal expenses. We are all affected. I\u2019m a doctor and even I can\u2019t get treatment for my own maladies,\u201d says Silvia, 41, an anaesthetist Opponents of the president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, passed a law last month that would allow Venezuela to accept international aid to prop up the healthcare system. But Maduro, in a television address, rejected the calls, describing them as an attempt to privatise the health system. Gonzalez feels lucky. His company provides medical insurance which means his wife will be able to have a caesarean in a private hospital next month. But even then, they have been asked to bring their own soap for the baby.  \u201cOur main worry is for the baby, since we don\u2019t know what she might need once she\u2019s born. My wife wants to breastfeed, but if for some reason we need baby formula, that\u2019s also very hard to find. In the black market it costs around 30% of a minimum monthly wage for a can that lasts four or five days,\u201d he says.",
