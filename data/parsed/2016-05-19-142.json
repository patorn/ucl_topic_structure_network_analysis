  "body": "Expecting GP surgeries to open between 8am and 8pm every day is an immoral misuse of scarce NHS resources that could damage patients\u2019 health, a leading family doctor has said. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s GPs committee, also said being forced to allow just 10 minutes for each patient appointment was \u201cneither humane nor defensible\u201d.  In a strongly worded attack on the government\u2019s drive to make family doctors more accessible at weekends as part of a seven-day NHS, Nagpaul said: \u201cWe must reject the immorality of taking GPs away from caring for acutely ill patients to sit in empty surgeries superfluous to need.\u201d  He called on the government to \u201cend its obsession with seven-day opening\u201d and said there were too few GPs and too little demand for weekend consultations to justify surgeries opening every day.  Turning to the length of consultations, Nagpaul told the BMA\u2019s annual conference of local medical committees, which represent GPs, that the changing burden of illness brought about by the ageing population and rise in long-term conditions meant that patients needed more time, even if others had to wait as a result.  \u201cNeither is it humane or defensible for GPs to be forced to manage patients with complex multiple problems in a pressure-cooker intensity of 10-minute aliquots,\u201d he said. \u201cGPs must be given longer consultation times in the interests of safe care, even if it means exposing a waiting list to see us.\u201d      The number of GPs working in England fell by 600 between 2014 and last year, from 34,700 to 34,100, figures show.

The growing number of family doctors quitting the profession, and difficulty persuading enough medical graduates to train as GPs to meet recruitment targets, meant the government\u2019s pledge was unlikely to succeed, Nagpaul suggested.  \u201cWith government figures stating 38% of GPs intend to quit in the next five years, mass resignation is not a threat \u2013 it\u2019s an impending reality,\u201d he said.  The latest statistics, released last month by the NHS\u2019s Health and Social Care Information Centre, showed that the number of GPs working in England fell by 600 between 2014 and last year, from 34,700 to 34,100 \u2013 a 2% drop.  Nagpaul welcomed NHS England\u2019s recent blueprint for improving GP services, called the General Practice Forward View, which contains 108 commitments and pots of money to help. But he warned it would not be enough to rescue struggling GPs from an \u201cinexorable, unmanageable workload\u201d.  The Department of Health did not respond to a request for comment.",
