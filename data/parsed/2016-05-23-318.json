  "body": "A prominent Chinese democracy activist who was jailed in 2015 during a Communist party attack on dissent has entered the second week of a hunger strike, according to his sister. Guo Feixiong, 49, was sentenced to six years behind bars in November 2015 for taking part in a protest against censorship outside the newsroom of a liberal newspaper in southern China.   Related: China democracy activist Guo Feixiong jailed for six years in Xi crackdown    Relatives and supporters of the activist, whose real name is Yang Maodong, say his health has deteriorated dramatically in recent months and accuse officials at Guangdong\u2019s Yangchun prison of denying him adequate medical treatment. Guo launched his hunger strike on 9 May, demanding better treatment as well as political change in China. On Monday morning Guo\u2019s sister, Yang Maoping, confirmed he was still refusing to eat. \u201cIt makes my heart ache,\u201d she said of his increasingly poor physical condition.  In an open letter to President Xi Jinping the veteran activist\u2019s wife, Zhang Qing, wrote: \u201cGuo Feixiong\u2019s indefinite hunger strike in prison is in response to the deliberately degrading way he has been treated by the authorities.\u201d \u201cNo one has the right to persecute Guo Feixiong to death, and the perpetrators of these evils must be stopped,\u201d Zhang wrote, according to a translation by the human rights group China Change.  \u201cThe brazenly unlawful behaviour of the domestic security and prison authorities in Guangdong makes a mockery of the Chinese authorities\u2019 claim to \u2018govern the country according to the law,\u2019\u201d the activist\u2019s wife added.  Speaking earlier this month, Human Rights Watch\u2019s China director, Sophie Richardson, said China\u2019s \u201ccruel and inhuman treatment\u201d of prisoners had become a worrying trend. \u201cChinese officials are earning an ugly reputation over their willingness to let political prisoners get terribly sick \u2013 and even die \u2013 in detention,\u201d Richardson said. In 2014 human rights activist Cao Shunli died after allegedly being denied medical treatment by authorities. Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
