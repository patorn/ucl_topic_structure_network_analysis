  "body": "Even the Queen\u2019s well-documented love of horses must have been sated by the equine extravaganza staged as part of her 90th birthday celebrations on Sunday. No fewer than 900 \u2013 10 for each of her years \u2013 paraded and pranced for her delectation at Windsor Castle during a birthday gala that also included a brace of dames in actor Helen Mirren and singer Shirley Bassey. TV royalty Ant and Dec welcomed the top tier of constitutional royalty \u2013 the Queen with the first and second in line to the throne \u2013 to the party in which even the myriad horses were outnumbered by 1,500 human riders and performers, including 600 from the military and some household-name special guests. Appropriately, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, 94, arrived in the horse-drawn Scottish state carriage. Other highlights of the show, televised live on ITV, were 13-year-old Kinvara Garner, from north Wales, who played a horse-obsessed teenage Princess Elizabeth as part of a re-enactment of Queen\u2019s life with set pieces from her birth, the second world war, her marriage and coronation.  Performers included singers James Blunt, Gary Barlow, Beverley Knight and Kylie Minogue from the world of pop. There was no visible evidence of the Queen wearing ear plugs as she had done at Buckingham Palace pop concerts staged to celebrate her Golden and Diamond Jubilees. In its unusual combination of regimental marching, gun salutes, pop, historical clips outlining an ABC of the Queen\u2019s life history, and Shetland ponies dashing to actor Imelda Staunton\u2019s singing \u201cSing Sing Sing Sing\u201d, the show was a unique homage. Staunton\u2019s husband Jim Carter, who played Downton Abbey butler Carson, narrated as the King\u2019s Troop Royal Horse Artillery proved their display mettle, and singer Alfie Boe stoked wartime memories by singing the Vera Lynn classic A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square. Katherine Jenkins delivered the patriotic I Vow to Thee My Country, and a choir version of the coronation anthem Zadoc the Priest also filled the arena and actor Martin Clunes appeared as president of the British Horse Society.  In his gala programme address, Prince Charles said: \u201cAs we marvel at the incomparable skill of rider and horse alike, we might allow our minds to drift to Xenophon\u2019s observation that \u201ca horse is a thing of beauty ... none will tire of looking at him as long as he displays himself in his splendour\u201d. He added he hoped everyone watching would \u201cjoin with me in wishing my mother, the Queen, the happiest of very special birthdays\u201d.

Bahrain is one of the sponsors of the Royal Windsor Horse Show. The Queen\u2019s daughter, Princess Anne, and son Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, along with her granddaughters Zara Tindall and Lady Louise Windsor got into the saddle as part of a birthday parade. Bagpipes, caber-tossing, some rare breed cattle, gun dogs and even a regimental goat on parade featured in a show that ended with a rousing rendition of Diamonds Are Forever by Bassey and the wheeling out of a giant birthday cake.",
