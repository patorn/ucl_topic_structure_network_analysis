  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull has warned Australia would lose vital \u201cleverage\u201d in international negotiations under Labor\u2019s plan to dramatically increase Australia\u2019s emissions reduction target.  On the first official day of the election campaign the prime minister criticised the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, for failing to realise that the world had \u201cmoved on from ideology\u201d in the climate change debate towards practical negotiations. But the Climate Institute contradicted Turnbull\u2019s comments, saying Australia had little leverage in climate negotiations because its emission targets were too low, not too high. Turnbull used his first press conference of the campaign to criticise Labor\u2019s plans to increase Australia\u2019s renewable energy target to 50% of electricity generated by 2030 and to reduce carbon pollution by 45% by 2030 based on 2005 levels.   Related: Paris climate deal: countries with about half of global emissions to join this year    The Coalition has a renewable energy target of 23% by 2020, but it has not settled on a post-2020 target. It has plans to reduce Australia\u2019s emissions by 26% by 2030 on 2005 levels, compared with Labor\u2019s 45% target. Turnbull said Labor\u2019s plan to boost Australia\u2019s emissions target would destroy the country\u2019s bargaining power in climate negotiations. \u201cWhat Mr Shorten has overlooked is not just the economic interests of Australians but the global objective,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cEverything changed in Paris at the Paris climate change conference. What happened there was remarkable. All of the nations in the world agreed to emissions targets for 2030. Each of them exerted some leverage on the other. \u201cFor an opposition leader who wants to be prime minister, to say that Australia would unilaterally nearly double its target, [that] abandons all leverage we would have. \u201cThe way these targets will rise in the future ... is by mutual agreement. So one nation will say, \u2018We\u2019ll go up a bit more if you go up a bit more.\u2019 That is the way these agreements are put together.\u201d But John Connor from the Climate Institute said Turnbull\u2019s interpretation of the Paris agreement, and the way countries were to move forward in international negotiations, was \u201crespectfully, incorrect\u201d. He said Australia had little bargaining power because the government\u2019s targets were not ambitious enough.   Related: Australia's solemn climate promise much more than a signing ceremony    \u201cThis was highlighted last month when Australia wasn\u2019t invited to a \u2018high ambition coalition\u2019 meeting including US, EU and small island states,\u201d Connor said. \u201cIf Australia is to have any leverage it will need to lift its ambition and then engage globally, not the other way around. \u201cHistory shows that when countries advance credible targets it drags up the targets of other nations, not the opposite. Australia is actually limiting its leverage by advancing an inadequate 2030 target.\u201d Connor said Turnbull\u2019s claim that all countries at the Paris conference had agreed to emissions targets for 2030 was also incorrect. \u201cBefore Paris, countries put forward a range of initial targets for 2025 or 2030. Counties only formalise their targets when they ratify the agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Abbott government submitted its initial, and inadequate 2030 target, well after most other advanced economies. \u201cA process to update these targets starts in 2018. Updated 2030 targets are to be submitted in 2019-20.\u201d He said Turnbull had implied other countries had not already agreed to strengthen their emissions targets but that was wrong. \u201cIn Paris they did and [they agreed] that targets will be strengthened every five years,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the PM notes this will be a collective process and a key test against which countries will be judged is whether the target is consistent with the goal [to limit warming to 1.5-2oC]. Labor environment spokesman Mark Butler also said Turnbull seemed not to understand how international negotiations work. \u201cIndividual country targets weren\u2019t negotiated in the Paris agreement, countries committed to the goal of keeping global warming to well below two degrees Celsius.  \u201cIt is then the responsibility of each country to set the appropriate targets to achieve the global goal,\u201d Butler said. \u201cMr Turnbull also doesn\u2019t understand that to keep pace with similar advanced economies and to inspire other nations to do better, Australia needs to show leadership in achieving our fair share of the global burden.\u201d",
