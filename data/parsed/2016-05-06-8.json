It\u2019s time, because on the eve of a two-month long federal election campaign, we\u2019re about to be subject to all manner of evocations from public figures about their advancement of the national interest and their love of their country. And there\u2019s nothing quite like an election campaign, either, to bring on a thoughtless flood of metaphors likening political competition to mortal combat (and a thoughtless flood of metaphors, full stop). And, so, the election, we\u2019ve been advised, will be an exercise in drawn out \u201ctrench warfare\u201d. Labor is already on the \u201cwar path\u201d, apparently, over an element of this week\u2019s federal budget while the government has prepared itself a massive \u201cwar chest\u201d. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the language of war and street violence (factional bosses are \u201cwarlords\u201d \u2013 yeah, right! \u2013 and you don\u2019t undermine or challenge an opponent but knife them, they don\u2019t suffer but bleed) has so imbued our political discourse.  For a century now, but with increasing emphasis in the past few decades, Australian history and culture has become increasingly militarised. The rose-coloured, government-funded (to the tune of up to $600m) festival of commemoration for the centenary of Anzac, now in full swing, makes that even more pronounced.    Related: Australia's Anzac carnival of commemoration leaves some things not talked about    Sport and politics are the greatest examples. Which brings me back to Australian patriotism and how the term has come to be increasingly and overwhelmingly applied to Australians who have fought \u2013 and continue to fight \u2013 wars in the name of Australia, all too often at the direction of Britain and the United States. I\u2019m not denying the sincerity of the proud patriotism \u2013 that is, the love of Australia \u2013 that many members of the armed forces espouse when asked why they fight. But Australia, overwhelmed with nationalistic, rose-coloured, government-funded sentimentality during the four-year festival of Anzac commemoration, is blinkered when it comes to looking too far beyond the military for its patriotism. The governor general, Peter Cosgrove, is a military man. Australia Day \u2013 for all its inappropriate symbolism given that it falls on the day of British invasion, 26 January \u2013 has as chair of its governing council, another military man, Ben Roberts-Smith. Australia Day, Anzac Day and Remembrance Day (Armistice Day) are the big secular commemorative days in Australia. Whatever happened to Federation Day? Increasingly, meanwhile, the country stops at the behest of politicians, to remember troops who fought and died in a number of battles like Lone Pine, Fromelles, Bullecourt and Ypres. So, let\u2019s take a step back to consider what patriotism might mean for those who love and have loved their country, but would never fight in its name overseas or don an Australian military uniform. Think about what a love of country really means. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been questioning some of my Indigenous friends about in recent weeks. I\u2019ve done that because, to my mind, the Indigenous experience of loving one\u2019s country is closest to the purest form of Australian patriotism I can find. Country: the earth from which the life force grows and to which it should ultimately return. Country: the place that provides food and shelter, and sustainable natural wealth. Country: the beauty of its trees, rocks, seas and creatures, and its sky overhead, to be celebrated and shared by all who experience it. It\u2019s why we should also celebrate the protectors of the environment, be they Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or non-Indigenous farmers who work hard to work the soil naturally and replenish it for future generations. One of my friends, an urban Indigenous man, described the surprising visceral outrage he felt when he\u2019d witnessed a simple act of thoughtless pollution while visiting his people\u2019s country. This was by way of explaining a deep spiritual connection to \u2013 and love of \u2013 country that he rarely visits. Plenty of Indigenous people I know talk about how their responsibility to country begins and ends with protecting the land, and traditional ways of life, from the ravages of some mining ventures. Land protection and climate change mitigation is franked with spiritual responsibility for Indigenous peoples the world over, not least in Australia. Many Indigenous Australians, therefore, not surprisingly, see themselves as the first patriots of this continent \u2013 those who resisted attack and who\u2019ve fought for their land from 1788. As an extension of that, they see fighting national and multinational mining companies that divide their communities and rape their lands as a continuum of the invasion and resistance. The first person to really point this out to me was Garrwa artist and environmental activist Jacky Green, who is fighting the appalling Glencore mining venture on his family\u2019s traditional lands at Borroloola, Northern Territory.  I can begin a list of all of the other Australian patriots \u2013 Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous. They are people motivated every day by love \u2013 a love that is sometimes hard and critical and questioning \u2013 of a land, and an ideal, that they want to protect from unfairness, cruelty, pain and inhumanity and environmental degradation. Theirs is a patriotism that will never wear a military uniform. They are refugee advocates, scientsists and doctors. Naturalists and archivists. Writers and artists. Teachers and occupational therapists. They include the man who drives the bus that takes the disabled young woman down the road to her place of work every day. They are the lesser known and the famous. Continue the list yourself. But now, back to the politicians.

Australia needs more politicians like Parke, an often iconoclastic but always very important voice when it comes to pursuing peace, the rights of refugees and national security overreach.  \u201cI came into this place to represent the Fremantle electorate and to engage in what I termed the war against indifference.  \u201cBefore I expand on that I would observe that there have been many wars fought in this place: the war on terror, the war on drugs, the war on people smugglers, the war on each other. Only the last one seems to have had any success, and that has been to the ultimate detriment of all of us and of public trust in our political system.\u201d",
