Metal carts bump over pavements and wooden mallets strike what looks like nougat, again and again. These are the sounds of the Muslim food market in Xian, in China\u2019s north-western Shaanxi province.     Front of house \u2026 an outdoor restaurant in Xian\u2019s Muslim food market. Photograph: Cathy Adams    The former imperial capital is home to a small community of Muslim Hui people, many of whom live around the Bell Tower and off West Street, close to the Great Mosque. And it\u2019s here that the city\u2019s best nighttime entertainment takes place: eating. All the dishes served from stalls and shopfronts are indigenous to the north-western provinces: it\u2019s a heady cuisine of Chinese-style cooking and Middle Eastern spices.

For starters: a chalky slab of fried tofu covered in red and green chillies and cumin (there\u2019s always cumin), and a paper cup of fried baby potatoes dripping in chilli oil and seasoned with spring onions, chilli and more cumin. Next came a bowl of liangpi, a Shaanxi staple: thick ribbons of rice noodle tossed with sesame paste, chilli oil and shreds of cucumber. Another stall had them in cold satay sauce. Locals eat the noodles in one hand and in the other roujiamo \u2013 a muffin filled with chopped lamb and slicked with chilli oil. It\u2019s the Hui equivalent of a burger. For dessert I had a slice of glutinous rice cake with plum sauce. Full, for under \u00a38.",
