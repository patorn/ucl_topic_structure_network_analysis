New passenger car registrations in the EU in April were up 9% on a year earlier to 1.3m vehicles \u2013 the highest since April 2008, just before the industry descended into a six-year slump, according to the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA). Nearly all carmakers recorded sales increases. Overall sales at Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, rose 5.4% from a year earlier as demand for its namesake brand recovered, with sales up 2.7% in April after dipping 1.6% in March. Its Audi and Porsche brands grew at double-digit rates. However, the group\u2019s market share slipped to 25.2%, from 26.1%.
