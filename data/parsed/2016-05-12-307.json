  "body": "For 16 years I have known I\u2019m terminally ill. I\u2019ve had to come to terms with the fact I won\u2019t grow old with my husband, or see my grandchildren become teenagers. I\u2019ve seen my body change; I am slowly wasting away. I have faced the mental struggle of being told I\u2019ve 18 months to live, only to see myself outlive the prognosis. I take 38 tablets every single day and rely on an oxygen tank to breathe. My spine is crumbling; I\u2019ve shrunk by two inches. My skin is covered in painful psoriasis, and I have a growth in my stomach the size of a 30-week pregnancy. And yet, despite this, my biggest challenge is trying to talk to you about the fact that soon, I will die. There\u2019s something about death that people can\u2019t face. We thrive on life; we celebrate it at every opportunity whether it\u2019s a birthday or a christening. And yet, even though everyone who lives will die, death remains the elephant in the room. It\u2019s a stigma, something we need to tiptoe around and leave to care professionals.    I\u2019ve planned my funeral. Everything is organised other than the type of coffin I\u2019ll have    This is a plea \u2013 to my family, my carer, doctors and specialists; to my friends and neighbours, and the people I\u2019m yet to meet: start talking about death as much as you talk about life. Think of death as something you can control, where you can live out your last wishes safe in the knowledge that the ones left behind will be able to cope without you. Start talking to your children about death as a natural process, not something to be scared of. Children are taught about sex, drugs and taxes, but not how to cope with death. We need to have conversations about dying \u2013 because yours could happen before mine.  I was in my early 20s when I was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). I was enjoying my life as a singer and music teacher and was newly married with two young children. It was a challenge, but manageable. That was, until around my 38th birthday when I was told COPD would, one day, take my life. There have been some close calls. On more than one occasion I\u2019ve had chest infections so severe we\u2019ve had to prepare, as a family, to say our goodbyes. I pulled through, but next time I might not. My sons and my husband are living with this disease as much as I am, and it\u2019s taking its toll. My husband recently had a heart attack and I was powerless to help him. I couldn\u2019t even visit in case I picked up an infection. We sleep in separate rooms and are more like friends than husband and wife. My youngest son has Asperger\u2019s, but rather than me care for him, he\u2019s learning how to help me cope with my illness. My eldest son has children of his own. My granddaughter, who\u2019s just two, lights up my life but even she is aware of my condition. I worry about what will happen to these people when I\u2019m gone.  I\u2019ve planned my funeral. Everything is organised other than the type of coffin I\u2019ll have. I like to go to parties, so we\u2019ll hold my wake before I\u2019m gone. When my death will be, no one knows. I\u2019ve fought my disease for years but I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019ve run out of energy. I\u2019m not giving up, but the battle will now take place from my bed \u2013 or my wheelchair, on the days I have enough motivation to get out of the house.   Related: This is not Casualty \u2013 in real life CPR is brutal and usually fails    I\u2019m making the choice to die at home, not in hospital, because I\u2019m so afraid I\u2019ll lose control of my death if I\u2019m on a ward. I\u2019ve come across a lack of understanding of my dying wishes; simple education of care professionals could improve this tenfold. How would you like the end your own life to be, and how do you expect that to happen if things don\u2019t change soon?  While some choose to turn a blind eye, many people deeply care about this subject. Organisations are coming together to approach fundraising in unique and different ways, to help bring about significant change. This is everyone\u2019s concern. We can all come together to make a difference by talking about the end of our lives. Talking about death won\u2019t make it happen to you \u2013 if it did, I\u2019d have died a long time ago. I have wishes, like you do. But while yours might be to travel the world or meet your hero, mine are simpler. I wish to live in a world where we talk openly and frankly about death; where, through discussion, those nearing the end of their life are understood, listened to, treated with respect and have the death they want whether that\u2019s at home, in hospital, or in a hospice.
