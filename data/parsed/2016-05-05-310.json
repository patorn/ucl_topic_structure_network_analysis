  "body": "There isn\u2019t an Advertising Standards Authority for book covers, but it does seem a bit cheeky to use the subtitle \u201cA\u00a0New Way to Think About Everything\u201d when the whole point is that this way to think about everything is extremely old. Michael Puett, teacher of a popular Harvard course in\u00a0Chinese philosophy, has partnered with the writer Christine Gross-Loh to\u00a0construct a large-print self-help book based on their readings of ancient\u00a0Chinese wisdom. The \u201cpath\u201d of\u00a0the title is the tao, or the Way. It remains to be seen whether it is also a\u00a0garden path up which the trusting reader is led. Each chapter draws lessons for modern life from a particular Chinese thinker or text. So we hear about Confucius on the usefulness of social ritual; Mencius and the impossibility of\u00a0making plans; Zhuangzi on \u201ctrained spontaneity\u201d; Xunzi on preferring artifice to nature; Laozi on soft power, and so forth. One problem is that the ancient-but-totally-new wisdom the authors cherry-pick from their sources is, by and large, completely unsurprising. These notions, they promise initially, \u201cflip on its head everything we\u00a0understand about getting to know ourselves and getting along with other people\u201d. Except that they don\u2019t, as the authors proceed to confess. \u201cMost of us know all this, to some extent,\u201d they concede; \u201cNone of these ideas is new to us,\u201d they allow; \u201cOf course, all this is\u00a0common sense,\u201d they admit. It is indeed not startling to be told that there are no strict rules about how to console a friend, or that you should try not to give in to your instant irritation with a co-worker, or that it\u00a0is\u00a0probably a bad idea to \u201cremove emotions\u201d from your decision-making; or that it\u00a0might enrich your life to join a\u00a0wine-tasting class or learn how to paint watercolours. The supposedly lost Chinese wisdom about training our\u00a0habits of action and emotional responses in order to become more virtuous is present in Aristotle as well as in modern philosophy and cognitive therapy. Anyone interested in the sophisticated ramifications of the concept of\u00a0wu-wei (non-action), meanwhile, should probably consult the far\u00a0more interesting treatment in Edward Slingerland\u2019s book Trying Not\u00a0to Try (2014). A more serious difficulty arises from\u00a0the authors\u2019 decision to give just\u00a0one interpretation, with clear and simple advice for 21st-century readers, of what are often deeply ambiguous texts. I am familiar, for example, with Taoist cosmology as it is embedded in\u00a0the theory of Chinese martial arts, where supposedly mystical concepts such as qi or Yin\u00a0and Yang have immediate physical meanings. The authors, however, prefer the hippier interpretations involving ethereal energies and the like, while reassuring the reader that you don\u2019t need to believe in them to find the concepts helpful. They seem positively to disapprove of readers who\u00a0view the Tao Te Ching of\u00a0Laozi as a\u00a0\u201cmartial arts manifesto\u201d, even if that sounds like the sort of thing that would be distributed by canvassers for\u00a0a presidential campaign by Jackie Chan (the\u00a0one martial art the\u00a0authors actually mention by name is judo, which is not Chinese but Japanese). The authors illustrate the martial philosophy they find in Laozi \u2013 the power of embracing softness \u2013 by describing the retreat of the Russian armies in order to defeat Napoleon. There is, oddly, no mention of the fact that it took masses of bombs and tanks to defeat Hitler. One or two ideas in this book do at least authentically contradict modern common sense. The authors\u2019 most persuasive passages point out that while we think we are more free than people in past ages, this depends on a\u00a0special idea of freedom according to\u00a0which self-knowledge enables self-determination and authenticity. But what if self-knowledge is limiting or\u00a0even entirely illusory? Noting the current fad for mindfulness, the authors point out that \u201cmindfulness was intended to break down the self\u201d, but Buddhism in\u00a0the west \u201chas often been distorted as a way of looking within and embracing the self\u201d. Such navel-gazing, they and the\u00a0Chinese sages agree, may be a\u00a0kind of imprisonment. Unfortunately much of the rest of The Path just sounds ludicrous, in part though not exclusively because the prose style of this terribly written book\u00a0is so fist-suckingly bad. This is a\u00a0universe in which you can become \u201cinfinitely more influential\u201d and in which, \u201cas we learn how to better our relationships, we will learn how to alter situations and thereby create infinite numbers of new worlds\u201d. We are reassured, too, that \u201cas-if moments can lead to tremendous movement\u201d, though it is unclear whether they are\u00a0promising the ability to shimmy like the dancefloor lovechild of John Travolta and Beyonc\u00e9, or merely awesome relief from constipation. Worse, we are told that Laozi can help you in \u201cthe conference room\u201d by\u00a0enabling you to \u201csee everything as undifferentiated\u201d. No doubt you will totally own the meeting when you can\u2019t tell the difference between profit and loss, or your company\u2019s product and a poisonous frog. Yet the authors happily characterise the Tao Te Ching as\u00a0\u201ccommitted to rejecting all distinctions\u201d, a recommendation that, taken seriously, would lead to a state of total idiocy, if it did not arise from one in the\u00a0first place. Then again, the authors do write confidently at one point: \u201cWhen you become a sage, you don\u2019t merely sense people well.\u201d I could conclude from this only that at least one of them is actually a sage and that\u00a0I\u00a0as a reader was, sadly, not yet ready to profit fully from their offer of\u00a0enlightenment. \u2022 To order The Path for \u00a311.99 (RRP \u00a314.99)go\u00a0to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
