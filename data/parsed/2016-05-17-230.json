The Deliver for Good campaign highlights 12 critical areas that, with greater investment, could improve the lives of women and girls and speed up efforts to achieve gender equality. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep looking at girls and women as body parts or diseases. This has to be integrated,\u201d said Katja Iversen, CEO of Women Deliver.            Why do women still die in childbirth, asks Emily Watson    A panel of 25 experts pulled together existing data on each issue into a policy brief, which includes how each topic is linked to the targets of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). \u201cThese 12 investments take a gender lens to the SDGs, where we have to invest politically, practically and economically,\u201d Iversen said. \u201cThe Deliver for Good campaign will drive action toward what we know is true: investing in girls and women unlocks untapped potential, and creates a ripple effect that benefits families, communities and entire nations. It\u2019s 2016. Now is the time to turn the conversation from \u2018if and why\u2019 to \u2018how and now\u2019.\u201d Among the policy briefs is the case for improving women\u2019s access to technology. If another 600 million women had access to the internet, annual GDP could increase by as much as $18bn (\u00a312.4bn) across 144 countries, it says. Another makes the case for keeping children in school for longer, arguing that every extra year of education a child receives increases the average annual GDP by 0.37%. Meanwhile economists found that investing in the elimination of gender-based violence was one of the most cost-effective targets of the SDGs.  The public are invited to sign up to the Deliver for Good initiative, and contribute their own suggestions and comments on the 12 policy briefs, which will be updated in September to mark the first anniversary of the adoption of the SDGs.

The recommendations focus on preventing the practice and better supporting those who have been cut. This includes treating obstetric complications, treating depression and anxiety as a result of the FGM and offering counselling to women about their sexual health. The guidelines warn health practitioners against the medicalisation of FGM \u2013 when parents ask health workers to carry out FGM believing it will be less harmful for the child.  \u201cHealth workers have a crucial role in helping address this global health issue. They must know how to recognise and tackle health complications of FGM,\u201d said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO assistant director general. \u201cAccess to the right information and good training can help prevent new cases and ensure that the millions of women who have undergone FGM get the help they need.\u201d More than 5,500 delegates from 169 countries are in Copenhagen this week for the four-day Women Deliver conference. Including the number of people watching the live stream of proceedings, the event is believed to be the largest global gathering to discuss women\u2019s and girls\u2019 health, rights and wellbeing in the past decade. \u201cThis week, more than 5,500 world influencers \u2026 are gathered here in Copenhagen to make change [and] ensure that the world delivers for women and for girls,\u201d said the prime minister of Denmark, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, during the opening plenary. \u201cThat is a joint responsibility. The fight for equal gender opportunities is not just a women\u2019s fight [or] a fight for women. It is a fight for all of us \u2013 women and men. It is a fight for a better and more prosperous world.\u201d Other speakers included the head of the World Health Organisation, Margaret Chan, Nobel peace prize winner Tawakkol Karman, former prime minister of Norway Gro Harlem Brundtland, and singer and activist Annie Lennox. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, sent a video message. The conference opens as it emerged the UN agency responsible for ending deaths in childbirth and promoting family planning is facing a $140m shortfall this year as major donors, including Denmark, cut funding.",
