In his 90-minute live show, he accompanies some of those stories with personal anecdotes and back-up dancers. \u201cRadio stories and dance: two things that really have no business being combined at all,\u201d he jokes at the show\u2019s start. It\u2019s an exceedingly strange concept, but somehow, it works \u2013 due not just to Glass\u2019s charisma and star power, but the talent and charm of the dancers: Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass are raw, funny and expressive, all elbows and eyebrows and understated grace. The trio test-drove a portion of the show for the first time in February 2013, during a benefit night organised by acclaimed composer Phillip Glass \u2013 a cousin of Ira \u2013 at Carnegie Hall in New York. When the curtains finally close after three years of sporadic touring, they will close on the Sydney Opera House stage.     \u2018It started as a joke\u2019: Ira Glass performs with Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass. Photograph: David Bazemore    The idea of bookending an utterly ridiculous concept at two of the most prestigious venues in the world is enormously funny to Glass \u2013 an \u201cironic porn purchase\u201d taken to its unironic climax.  \u201cIt started as a joke, and then became a reality \u2026 OK, we\u2019ve been doing this for two years, we should end it somewhere. Where should we end it? I was like, \u2018Sydney Opera House!\u2019 and everyone else was like, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 \u201d he says, through laughter. \u201cHonestly, the people who booked this \u2013 well, it turns out to be a really big thing to try to do.\u201d Branching out into the extremely niche contemporary-dance-meets-narrative-audio scene is an unexpected move for someone who\u2019s already doing quite well at their day job, I venture.  Glass sighs. \u201cI\u2019m often having moments where I\u2019m like, \u2018Huh. It\u2019s so interesting that it\u2019s come to this.\u2019 \u201d Act One: The Best Form of Flattery After 20 years on the air, This American Life is often credited for ushering in not only a public radio revolution, but the rise of storytelling as an industry and podcasting as a form. Glass believes we\u2019re experiencing a \u201cpodcasting bubble\u201d, but he\u2019s not too scared of the burst.  \u201cMost people have still not listened to a podcast, so I feel it hasn\u2019t reached its own natural gross yet,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are still feeling a glow of first love. It\u2019s going to take two or three years for that to wear off, and then something else will happen \u2013 I don\u2019t know what.\u201d For now, Glass feels as if he\u2019s holding on to a \u201cwinning lottery ticket\u201d: \u201cThe one part of journalism that isn\u2019t struggling is longform audio, and I happened to be sitting there.\u201d This year presents a new challenge to This American Life: how to report on one of the most ridiculous elections in American history in a way that treats each party equally. \u201cPeople are disagreeing in such a fundamental way about the problems the country faces,\u201d Glass says. \u201cEven disagreeing on what the problems are. Like, one of the two political parties doesn\u2019t believe that climate change is real. One of the two political parties thinks the biggest problem facing America is immigration \u2026 This is in politics everywhere, all over the world, where people from each side have trouble understanding the other. But there\u2019s such a dramatic gap between the two sides now. It\u2019s honestly very hard to know how to cover it in a way that is fair to both sides, and is interesting.\u201d The tactic his team has landed on involves \u201ccovering the politics by covering people\u2019s relationship to it\u201d. In one episode, reported by Zoe Chase, a rightwing Christian talk show host comes to terms with the fact that his listeners are going for Trump; in another, a black, gay teenager explains why he\u2019s voting for Trump: because he\u2019s more tolerant towards gay people than Cruz. (It never occurs to him to vote Democratic.) \u201cAs Zoe says in the story, when we cover politics we pretend that the voters fit these neat little voting blocks: if you believe this, you\u2019re voting for this person; and if you\u2019re this kind of person you vote in this way. When really it\u2019s so much more a function of less rational thinking.\u201d Over the past 20 years, This American Life\u2019s style of journalism \u2013 narrative non-fiction driven by personalities, with a story arc that can occasionally belie complexities \u2013 has been imitated globally; some people even ape Ira Glass\u2019s voice. Glass says the longform narrative revolution that his show has inspired doesn\u2019t frustrate him; after all it\u2019s a medium he loves to listen to, not only make. What does get on his nerves, though, is the proliferation of podcasts. Thus follows a screed that \u2013 while intended as tongue in cheek \u2013 smacks a little of the truth: \u201cWhy does everybody have to do a podcast now?\u201d he cries, with mock outrage. \u201cWhy does the director of the Big Short have to do a podcast? Why do you have to be excellent at your day job and then do my job too, and be pretty good at that job also? It\u2019s humiliating!\u201d He\u2019s starts laughing, but doesn\u2019t slow down: \u201cWhy is my job like the second job that somebody who\u2019s a genius at something else can do, and actually still be really good at? It\u2019s not fair! Like, the New York Times is launching all these podcasts. Why can\u2019t they simply be the greatest newspaper in our country? Why isn\u2019t that enough for them? Why do they have to do podcasts too? And the New Yorker: Why not be the most legendary, celebrated proponent of longform journalism in the United States? Why do you have to try to do my job, and then do a decent job at it? How dare you!\u201d Of course, he has no reason to fear. This American Life and its spin-off Serial are still regularly topping the iTunes podcast charts, and at their helm, Glass has become the most successful podcaster in the history of the form.      Ira Glass: \u2018The one part of journalism that isn\u2019t struggling is longform audio, and I happened to be sitting there.\u2019 Photograph: David Bazemore    Act Two: A Whistle In The Dark Ira Glass\u2019s faux outrage at the New York Times for moving into his podcast turf feels particularly hypocritical for someone who has tried his hand at almost everything else. The concept of his new live show, for instance, is inherently absurd \u2013 but he wanted to do it, so he did it.  Glass seems to be someone who is never satisfied doing the same thing for too long. This is why he\u2019s branched his radio show out into live talks and a TV series; it\u2019s why he\u2019s produced movies and comic books and the blockbuster Serial; and it\u2019s why, the night before we speak, he made his improv debut, performing character-based longform with his teacher Rick Andrews (he had only one lesson, and there is evidence of it online) and Andrews\u2019 improv partner, Louis Kornfeld, at New York\u2019s Magnet Theatre. He said the night was \u201creally wonderful\u201d; he felt comfortable, he got some laughs, and they asked him to come back. \u201cBut I also had this feeling: these are super skilled people who are great at this \u2013 and the fact that as an amateur, I would be allowed to perform with them? \u201cIt\u2019s the same way I feel with the dancers: these are completely professional people who have organised a show with 300 lighting cues and 15 costume changes and props \u2013 a national, then international tour. That I could end up in the middle of that is amazing.\u201d More surprising than an amateur being asked to perform on stage with professionals is an amateur accepting the offer. Most of us wouldn\u2019t want to try out potentially humiliating skills in front of a crowd; most of us would be crippled by anxiety.  \u201cNo \u2013 all those things did make me nervous,\u201d he replies emphatically. \u201cThe improv made me nervous. Being in the dance show was much scarier than other things I\u2019ve done. And honestly, making the radio show is still hard. I have really hard weeks on the show where I\u2019m really frightened, and really struggling to make the show good. I feel like fear is just part of making something good, you know? \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way that you do it that\u2019s not that way. Maybe Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg don\u2019t feel that, because they\u2019re so good at their jobs or something. But I definitely am worried that things will be bad, all the time. Even making the radio show \u2013 I often feel that I\u2019m at the very limits of what I\u2019m capable of. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 I feel like I\u2019m actually sort of scared all the time.\u201d That anxiety can \u2013 and often does \u2013 plague even the most successful people is a concept worth exploring with someone who has Ira Glass\u2019s job. Every week or two he puts out a brand new hour\u2019s worth of radio, which over two decades has become more and more ambitious. What was once mostly personal narratives and hyper-local stories has recently delved into the political and contested, covering everything from racial politics to school shootings to the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. In January 2012, the show excerpted a piece from monologuist Mike Daisey about the exploitation of Chinese workers by Apple, which it turned out Daisey had partly fabricated and dramatised. Most blamed Daisey for the indiscretion, but a few pointed the finger at Ira Glass as well; as the Baffler\u2019s Eugenia Williamson put it at the time: \u201cDaisey stepped forward to deliver to This American Life listeners exactly what Glass had conditioned them to expect \u2013 a dramatic nonfiction narrative in the form of a personal journey.\u201d  The radio show devoted a subsequent episode to a retraction, in which both Glass and Daisey acknowledged the mistakes they had made, while debating the blurring line between fiction and first-person journalism. \u201cDaisey lied to me,\u201d Glass said at the time. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that we never should\u2019ve put this on the air. In the end, this was our mistake.\u201d For an anxious storyteller, these are high stakes \u2013 higher now that everyone\u2019s listening. These days, what\u2019s the biggest fear that jolts him awake at night?  \u201cI mean, of course I\u2019m worried about getting things wrong, like any reporter,\u201d Glass answers. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the low level murmur that\u2019s in your head all the time as you\u2019re gathering information. My real fear is that the episode won\u2019t be that special, you know? That it\u2019ll just be in that kind of mediocre, grey, \u2018nyeeeeaaaahhh OK, got it\u2019 sort of range.\u201d As a boss, Glass says he\u2019s still learning: \u201cOne of the things that I have to learn over and over again is to not push the deadlines as much as I do.\u201d He brings up the show that aired the weekend before our talk, For Your Reconsideration. He had three weeks to write a story for it, but spent it much like most of the rest of us did: by procrastinating. \u201cWe put the last fix into the show literally two minutes before it began its live national feed ... And it was entirely my fault. I work with lovely people who I didn\u2019t need to put through that.\u201d He\u2019s also still learning how to be a better storyteller. He brings up a tactic used by This American Life reporter Chana Joffe-Walt, which he\u2019s looking forward to stealing from her, often. \u201cIn her stories, she takes, like, 40 seconds \u2013 less \u2013 early in the story, and tells you some detail about the person that makes you totally fix on them, and incidentally makes you adore them.\u201d  He quotes a few examples off the top of his head. In the first, an episode about public school integration, one of her main characters is a lawyer \u2013 \u201cNot the sparkliest on the radio,\u201d says Glass. But on-air, Joffe-Walt describes him thus: \u201cHe brings the decorum of a courtroom to all matters \u2026 He can elevate simple things, like phone tag.\u201d After playing a message he left her, she says: \u201cI believe you can hear his bow tie through the voicemail.\u201d Ira says: \u201cThat piece of writing totally nails him, and then in all the not-sparkly quotes he gives, you just love him. That would be a problem for the quotes in any normal story, but for her it becomes a character trait [that you\u2019re in on].\u201d In another, Joffe-Walt describes an Alzheimer\u2019s patient, Carl, and his wife, Susan: \u201cShe\u2019s a full head taller than Carl. Their favourite joke is that Susan says: \u2018I almost overlooked him!\u2019 \u2013 and then he jumps in the air so she can see his face.\u201d Glass says: \u201cI was just like: \u2018How come nobody ever taught me to do that? And now why do I have to steal that from Chana, who\u2019s like 20 years younger than me?\u201d      Ira Glass: \u2018It\u2019s a sobering thing to realise that you have a terrible boss, and you are that boss.\u2019 Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images for the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival    Act Three: Drugs and Hugs In the same episode, Joffe-Walt turns the microphone on Glass himself, to find out if he has any regrets. Glass, who is now 57, says he has never felt plagued by career doubt: he\u2019s been working in radio since he was 19, when he got an internship writing promos for NPR, and hasn\u2019t slowed down since.  He describes his 30s to Joffe-Walt: \u201cEvery moment, I was either working or asleep. Like, those were the two things I did and I didn\u2019t have a problem with it \u2026 I wish I\u2019d created more space for myself and I wasn\u2019t working all the time, for sure. But I don\u2019t want it enough that I\u2019d do anything about it.\u201d   Related: Ira Glass: 'The first time I took ecstasy, my anxiety lifted away'    Perhaps Glass has no regrets because things have worked out so well for him. He lives with his wife, Anaheed Alani, and their dog (they have no children) in Manhattan, a short walk from their jobs, at which they both excel. In 2011, Alani became editorial director of the online magazine Rookie, the latest castle in the kingdom of then-15-year-old fashion-blogger-media-model-Broadway-star Tavi Gevinson. She has since moved on to other projects. I\u2019m interested in how someone as work-obsessed as Glass balances a relationship with a partner who is equally busy. He mulls over his answer. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to figure out, on a week to week way, how to spend time,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cHow to divide it up between the people you like, and the people you love, and the things you want to do \u2013 and the things you said \u2018yes\u2019 to but now you can\u2019t get out of, but they seemed like a good idea at the time. \u201cAdulthood is a real muddle that way. If you\u2019re lucky, you get to a point where everything in your life is something that you chose \u2013 you went out of your way, and you chose it. You were lucky enough to be able to choose the kind of job you would want, and to choose the kind of person you would want to live with, and to choose the sort of place where you would want to live. So basically, at that point, you\u2019re at a stage of your life where you can only blame yourself. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t like about your life, well, you invented the whole thing yourself \u2013 you really can\u2019t complain.  \u201cIt\u2019s a sobering thing to realise that you have a terrible boss, and you are that boss.\u201d Glass brings it back to his marriage: \u201cThe honest answer to your question is that I think Anaheed and I could do this whole thing better, and that we\u2019re a terrible role model for anyone. We muddle our way through, for sure. And we\u2019ve been together for 20 years \u2013 but it\u2019s hard on us. I feel like I know other people who manage it way, way better.\u201d He tells me of a fairly unorthodox tactic used by two extremely successful friends of theirs, who have been together for decades and are raising kids. \u201cThey have this once-a-year ecstasy date,\u201d Ira says. (He and Anaheed haven\u2019t tried this, but he says he \u201cwould consider it\u201d.) \u201cBasically once a year they take ecstasy together and they spend the day together and talk, and get a lot of stuff off their chests, and they reconnect. They say it\u2019s just enormously helpful. I find that comforting.\u201d The last time he spoke to the Guardian, Glass related taking the drug once, and feeling for the first time what it was like to function without a low-level anxiety. \u201cI guess that\u2019s my move when I talk to the foreign press,\u201d he laughs, when reminded of that article. \u201cPeople in the United States can\u2019t read this, right?\u201d For he and Alani, he says counselling works. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going to marriage counselling every week since before we were married,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps to have a neutral party to just stand back and say, \u2018OK, you shut up \u2013 what are you saying?\u2019 \u2018OK, listen, when she says this, she means this, and when he says this, what he means is this.\u2019 And we\u2019re both like, \u2018Oh! Right!\u2019 \u201d He brings up Kristen Bell and Dax Shepherd, who have publicly said they\u2019ve been seeing a counsellor for their whole relationship also: \u201cThey said, if you can afford it you get a trainer at the gym. You\u2019re not a professional. Get somebody who knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d And then take some pills? I offer. \u201cAnd then take some pills! Exactly.\u201d \u2022 Three Acts, Two Dancers, One Radio Host appears at Alys Stephens Center in Birmingham, Alabama, on 11 June; Belk Theatre in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 25 June; Melbourne State Theatre on 14 and 15 July; the Sydney Opera House on 17 and 18 July",
