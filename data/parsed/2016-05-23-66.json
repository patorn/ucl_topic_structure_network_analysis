  "body": "Readers who enjoyed Chris Riddell\u2019s grammar monsters (Report, 14 May; Letters, 17 May) will also smile at the creatures in James Thurber\u2019s illustrations for a new natural history. The imaginary menagerie includes the spitting image, the dead ringer, the huff, the white lie and the bare-faced lie, the quandary, and an upstart rising from a clump of Johnny-come-lately. They all appear in The Beast in Me and Other Animals (1948).Christine HartasNewcastle upon Tyne \u2022 In his interview with Bristol\u2019s newly elected mayor (G2, 23 May), John Harris mentions a statue in the city of Edward Colston, \u201cthe 17th- and 18th- century slave trader and philanthropist\u201d. Doesn\u2019t the first occupation render the second hobby meaningless? Such \u201cphilanthropy\u201d was merely diverting money stolen from the unpaid labour of slaves; it wasn\u2019t Colston\u2019s to give.Keith HughesEdinburgh \u2022 Alas, I could not get through the opinion piece by Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan (The world must share Turkey\u2019s refugee burden, 23 May), as one thought obsessed me: did he have to write it himself, since all the Turkish journalists are already in his jails?Robert Pierre TomasToronto, Ontario, Canada \u2022 I know that the prestige of the FA Cup has declined in recent years, but surely it has not sunk so low that winning it is now an instantly sackable offence (Van Gaal on the up \u2013 and down and out, Sport, 23 May)?John DobsonAllendale, Northumberland \u2022 On Radio 4\u2019s The Week in Westminister, I heard Tory Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin say of the Conservatives \u201cloyalty is our secret weapon\u201d. It\u2019s clearly a very secret weapon at the moment.Des BrownNewcastle upon Tyne \u2022 In response to Penny Maris (Letters, 6\u00a0April), I offer an updated palindrome: \u201cA man, a pot ... to Panama!\u201d\u00a0Mick HodgkinLondon \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
