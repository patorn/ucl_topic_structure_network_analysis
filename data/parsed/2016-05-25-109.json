  "body": "Hillary Clinton is ready for an all-female election ticket, but unfortunately the vice-president she had in mind prefers her day job. Talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres declined to be Clinton\u2019s running mate after learning that the vice-president doesn\u2019t get to live in the White House. \u201cYou\u2019ll live in the vice-president\u2019s house \u2026 but it\u2019s a nice house,\u201d Clinton said during her most recent appearance on the show, taped on Tuesday in its Burbank studios and scheduled to broadcast on Wednesday. \u201cNo, I have a nice house. I\u2019m fine,\u201d DeGeneres replied. Clinton dropped by the show\u2019s studio between campaign stops to tape her third appearance since becoming a presidential candidate. With a largely female audience and an adoring host, the presumptive Democratic nominee has relied on the show to help connect with voters, particularly women who will play a crucial role in a prospective general election against Donald Trump.  DeGeneres, who made it clear she was supporting Clinton, asked her if she thought her Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, should drop out. Sanders has vowed to stay in the race until the California primary on 7 June, and possibly until the convention, even though his path is mathematically unlikely.

Clinton demurred as she had in the past, making it clear that she believes the Democratic primary has already been won.  \u201cLook, I think he has to do what he chooses to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand that. I ran all the way to the end against then Senator Obama. And when it was over, because we had a much closer race than the one currently is between Senator Sanders and myself, I withdrew. I endorsed him and I worked really hard to elect him and I do believe that Bernie will do that.\u201d \u201cI hope so,\u201d replied DeGeneres. The two also talked about whether Trump would be \u201cgood for women\u201d, as he has claimed when pressed about past behavior that would appear to demonstrate the opposite.  \u201cHe has been very derogatory toward all kinds of women,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe has specifically called out women by name, insulted them. He has said that equal pay isn\u2019t a real issue.\u201d That Clinton will almost certainly face Trump in the general election is something she admits she did not expect.  \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the 16 other Republicans who ran against him ever thought that would happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to give him what he\u2019s accomplished. He\u2019s won the most votes, it appears. And he\u2019s going to be the nominee.\u201d Clinton appeared on the show just days after her presidential polling found for the first time in the campaign that Trump has just barely edged past Clinton. Her campaign has contended that her polling numbers will rise once Sanders exits the race and the party coalesces around her. And yet, both Clinton and Trump are among the most historically unpopular nominees six months before an election.  But Clinton appeared at ease and confident on DeGeneres\u2019s show. She especially enjoyed playing \u201cWho\u2019d you rather\u201d \u2013 vice-president edition.  \u201cThis is very helpful,\u201d Clinton deadpanned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody, because we want it to be a big surprise.\u201d DeGeneres threw up pictures of two people on screen and asked Clinton to choose a potential candidate. Vice-President Joe Biden or Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban? \u201cOh, Joe!\u201d Clinton exclaimed, squashing Cuban\u2019s offer to \u201cconsider\u201d being her running mate.  Biden or actor Tony Goldwyn, who plays the president on Scandal and has campaigned on the trail for Clinton? \u201cGotta go with Tony,\u201d she said.  She picked Goldwyn again against Sanders, and was only hung up on having to choose between him and George Clooney, who has hosted top-dollar fundraisers for Clinton.  \u201cTony can be the first term, George can be the second,\u201d she said. The game went on like this. Leonardo DiCaprio or Beyonc\u00e9? Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cI really believe in making lemonade out of lemons,\u201d Clinton said, though she admitted before the show to only having watched part of Lemonade, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s recently released visual album.  The game ended with a final choice between the host and Michelle Obama. \u201cBut I already offered it to you!\u201d Clinton replied, feigning exasperation. Clinton was also asked whether it would be illegal for her husband, as a former president, to become vice-president. \u201cWell, if you\u2019ve served two terms it would be hard to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve only served one term I think technically you might be able to, because he served two terms.\u201d \u201cSo he can\u2019t be your vice-president,\u201d said DeGeneres. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Clinton. The former secretary of state\u2019s interview followed an appearance by the all-female cast of Ghostbusters, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, who impersonates both Clinton and DeGeneres on Saturday Night Live. When the show\u2019s lineup was announced last, DeGeneres tweeted: \u201cGet your Woman Cards ready.\u201d The remake of the Hollywood classic has received criticism for its all-female cast, and it has earned the unfortunate distinction of being the most disliked movie trailer on YouTube.  After the interview, McKinnon reappeared on stage.  \u201cIs this weird?\u201d DeGeneres asks McKinnon. \u201cI\u2019m being sandwiched between two women who have changed history and who I\u2019ve loved for decades,\u201d McKinnon said with her arms around her doppelgangers. \u201cBut it is sort of like being at a party and you realize that two of your exes are both there.\u201d",
