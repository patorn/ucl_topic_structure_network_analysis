The ruthless campaign against Duncan Storrar after his intervention on Q&A illustrates the ongoing political utility of moral assessments of the poor. The earliest iterations of what we\u2019d now call welfare policy developed after the accession of Edward VI in 1547 distinguished very explicitly between the \u201cdeserving\u201d and the \u201cundeserving\u201d poor.   Related: Duncan Storrar responds to Q&A furore: 'I didn't want this'    Capitalism requires a certain level of unemployment. As Richard Dennis notes in his book Econobabble, \u201cgovernments in Australia like to have at least half a million unemployed people at any point in time\u201d. But discussions about the structural necessity of human misery easily push in radical directions. If the problem\u2019s recognised as systemic, people might demand that the system be changed.   Related: Election 2016: Shorten 'cannot deliver' on border control, says Turnbull \u2013 politics live    That was why the early poor laws emphasised the morality of the individual supplicant rather than the ethics of the social order. It\u2019s an emphasis that resonates today. The sociologist Abram de Swaan argues that, all across Europe, three main criteria have been used to separate the deserving poor from their undeserving brethren. The first of them is proximity. It\u2019s only \u201cour\u201d poor who deserve succour. Foreigners, immigrants, minorities, and anyone else deemed somehow \u201cother\u201d are entitled to nothing. At best, they\u2019re someone else\u2019s problem; at worst, they\u2019re spongers and parasites. The contemporary asylum seeker debate provides an obvious example. The second criteria is (dis)ability. If the poor are assessed as being physically capable of work, they\u2019re undeserving \u2013 and they probably need to be punished. The English Poor Act of 1552 duly decreed:  If any man or woman, able to work, should refuse to labour and live idly for three days, he or she should be branded with a red hot iron on the breast with the letter V and should be judged the slave for two years of any person who should inform against such idler.  That\u2019s tough love, Tudor-style. The final criteria is docility. In many ways, it\u2019s the most interesting of the three. The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 established the workhouse system, in which the destitute would only receive relief if they entered a prison-like facility. The idea was that, as a royal commission into the operation of the poor laws explained, \u201cwork, confinement, and discipline will deter the indolent and vicious\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t enough merely for the poor to work. They also had to display the right attitude. In 1867, the children of the workhouse in Wrexham in North Wales staged a Christmas concert. To demonstrate, they\u2019d absorbed the sentiment fitting to their station, the infants carolled a \u201cSong of Gratitude\u201d to celebrate their confinement:  God bless our kindly MasterLikewise the Matron too:So wise to rule, so kind to bear,With faults we often do.Now while we are singingOur thanks to all we giveWho smile on lowly children,Long may they happy live.  The Daily Telegraph recently provided an illustration of what a similar attitude might look like today. \u201cScoMo, Hero of the Hard Worker,\u201d proclaimed the Tele\u2019s headline, the day after the most recent budget. The accompanying cartoon portrayed Scott Morrison as seen by these hypothetical workers, who apparently envisage their treasurer as a buffed-up Superman. God bless our kindly master, indeed. The corollary of this emphasis is that, by definition, those who ask for alms shouldn\u2019t be given them. In Oliver Twist, Charles Dickens famously describes what happens when one impoverished boy chooses not to be docile.       The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said, \u2018Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for more!\u2019 There was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance. \u2018For more!\u2019 said Mr. Limbkins. \u2018Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?\u2019 \u2018He did, sir,\u2019 replied Bumble. \u2018That boy will be hung,\u2019 said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u2018I know that boy will be hung.\u2019  You can see, then, where Duncan Storrar went wrong. By posing a question of assistant treasurer Kelly O\u2019Dwyer \u2013 and, what\u2019s worse, a question that she couldn\u2019t answer \u2013 he displayed a disturbing level of self-confidence. The resulting headlines declaring him a thug and a criminal duly played upon centuries of tropes about dangerous vagabonds and impudent paupers. But the intensity of the reaction also reflects the peculiar conjunction in which we find ourselves: on the one hand, an economic situation akin the early 20th century; on the other hand, a political environment more reminiscent of a hundred years earlier. Since the global financial crisis, the sclerotic global economy has generated a level of inequality reminiscent of the Jazz Age. At the same time, the vehicles of mass democracy developed during the 20th century (political parties, trade unions, pressure groups, etc) have been either destroyed or hollowed out of all social content. An apathetic cynicism now prevails throughout most industrialised countries about a political process perceived as irrelevant to ordinary people\u2019s lives. In that context, it\u2019s not surprising that interventions by outsiders can spectacularly break through the status quo. A zinger about tax from the Labor party wouldn\u2019t have had nearly the same impact: Duncan Storrar\u2019s words resonated because we almost never hear poor people speaking on their own behalf.  Of course, that\u2019s also the reason for the backlash. If the poor lose their docility, there\u2019s no telling what might happen.",
