  "body": "The first new Carry On movie in 25 years, Carry on Doctors, is to address the ongoing crisis in the NHS. Producer Jonathan Sothcott told the Mirror that a sense of social realism would be vital to recreating the long-running saga for the 21st century. \u201cThe NHS is the best thing in the world. But it\u2019s also something that we British love to grumble about \u2013 we will be addressing the crisis,\u201d he said.   Related: Infamy! Infamy! Carry On films to carry on again after 25 years    \u201cThe Carry On films have always had this great relationship with the NHS, because they spoof it \u2013 but they are also actually very protective of it. It\u2019s important the film reflects what is going on. \u201cAlso, everyone in Britain still gets embarrassed to go to the doctor and pee into a test tube. That\u2019s a very British thing.\u201d However, other aspects of the saga will change to reflect modern society. Sothcott said the character of Matron, played by Hattie Jacques in 1967\u2019s similarly titled Carry On Doctor and 1969\u2019s Carry On Again Doctor, would now be portrayed as a \u201cbutch gay\u201d man. He also said 78-year-old Barbara Windsor, one of the few surviving members of the original troupe of Carry On players, was unlikely to return. \u201cBarbara spent the best part of 20 years trying to reinvent herself,\u201d said Sothcott. \u201cShe has moved on with her life.\u201d Carry On Doctors will be written by Tim Dawson and Susan Nickson, best known as the writers of the BBC sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps. The new instalment will be the first in a slate of new films, with producers hoping to recruit a fresh ensemble of homegrown talent to star in them.  A second film, Carry On Campus, is already set to follow Carry On Doctors into production.  \u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2016. An earlier version of the main photo caption, as supplied by the agency, said that it was of June Jago and Sid James. It is Valerie van Ost and Sid James.",
