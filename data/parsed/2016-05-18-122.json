There with their tops off, smooth and firm as tofu, are brothers Matt and Phil Letten. They run a blog, sell an online fitness course and, at the end of last year, signed a deal with Penguin Random House to write a book, which the pair predict will become \u201cthe vegan bible for years to come\u201d. They swear and they brag; they are the self-proclaimed leaders of an \u201carmy of fit, sexy, vegan soldiers\u201d. They say things such as: \u201cThe animals are counting on us not to fuck shit up for them,\u201d and suggest that the reason they got so ripped and (to use a non-vegan adjective) beefy was because \u201cthe animals deserved better than a stereotypical skinny-ass vegan\u201d.    Related: Felicity Cloake: my week as a vegan    Phil became a vegetarian first after seeing a video of animals at a factory farm, then went vegan about eight years ago. Matt used to be anti-vegan until he discovered fitness. \u201cI was one of the people who, when somebody talked about veganism, would start making bacon jokes,\u201d he says, when I speak to the brothers over Skype. \u201cThat was me.\u201d They launched their Vegan Bros brand a year and a half ago, and have attracted a lot of attention. \u201cWe wanted to get across the message that vegan eating isn\u2019t some niche thing any more,\u201d says Phil. \u201cWe\u2019ve entered the age of the new vegan. There used to be these stereotypes about vegans. It was considered maybe more feminine or hippy.\u201d Things are different today, they say \u2013 they have vegan friends who are police officers, military personnel, investment bankers and airline pilots. \u201cAthletes are becoming vegan,\u201d says Phil.     The Vegan Bros    It is certainly true that the number of vegans is growing. According to new research by Ipsos Mori, commissioned by the Vegan Society, there are 542,000 vegans in Britain \u2013 the previous estimate, from 2006, was just 150,000. \u201cThis is an increase of more than 350% over the decade, although much of it, we suspect, has taken place over the past couple of years,\u201d says Jimmy Pierson, a spokesman for the Vegan Society. Another estimated 500,000 vegetarians are considering going vegan, so we could be looking at more than a million British vegans before long. There are other indications that more people are shunning animal-derived products. Google searches for \u201cvegan\u201d have doubled since 2011, while the market in animal-free food and drink is growing \u2013 according to the research company Mintel, the number of products launched in the UK marked \u201csuitable for vegans\u201d grew by 134% between 2012 and 2015. Vegan dishes used to be restricted to wholefood cafes, but now Wetherspoon pubs have recently launched a vegan menu, while Pret a Manger has seen sales of its vegetarian options soar, and is introducing two new vegan specials every month over the summer.

Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cIt has never been easier to be vegan,\u201d says Pierson. \u201cThe availability of vegan food has improved significantly, with more products now stocked in mainstream supermarkets which had, in the past, been available only in specialist health-food stores. We are seeing free-from shelves expanding, and dairy-free alternatives to milk increasing their market share. Cast your mind back a year or so \u2013 the landscape looked very different.\u201d Food tech companies, such as the vegan firm Hampton Creek, which launched no-egg mayonnaise, have attracted huge investment.   Related: Felicity Cloake: my week as a vegan    What is pushing the trend? Campaigns to get people to drop meat and animal products for a specific period of time \u2013 Meat-Free Mondays or Veganuary \u2013 have been a relatively comfortable introduction to veganism for many people. Social media has helped raise awareness of some of the atrocities of factory farming and many people are concerned about the environmental impact of eating meat. The global production of meat and dairy produces more greenhouse gas emissions than transport, and a recent study found that a widespread adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet would dramatically cut emissions related to agriculture and food production \u2013 by 63% if we went vegetarian, and 70% if vegan. On his podcast earlier this year, the atheist thinker and neuroscientist Sam Harris recalled a conversation he\u2019d had with the psychologist Paul Bloom on the subject of what will horrify our descendants when they look back at the 21st century. \u201cOn both of our shortlists was the horrorshow of factory farming,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither of us could defend it, both of us participated in this machinery of death, and we both admitted that it was only because it was out of sight and out of mind that we were able to do so.\u201d Harris became a vegetarian and says he is \u201can aspiring vegan\u201d. The implication is that anyone who believes in reason and rationality, when faced with the evidence \u2013 on animal welfare, environmental impact and human health \u2013 should become vegan. But the vegan movement hasn\u2019t been helped by its image; it has been \u201chijacked\u201d, as a Salon piece by psychiatrist (and vegan) Steven Stankevicius put it, \u201cby misinformed hippies, in the same way that meditation has been stained by a similar trend of idiocy. Both have been strangled between pseudo-spiritualism and pseudo-science, and almost entirely obscured from the view of rational-thinking people in the process.\u201d     A vegan fair in Berlin. Photograph: Carsten Koall/Getty Images    Alongside this is the unstoppable rise of the wellness bloggers and \u201ceat clean\u201d enthusiasts, who seem to view eating mostly plants primarily as a route to health and glowing Instagram selfies, rather than for ethical reasons (a well-planned vegan diet brings a lower risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers, but then lots of vegans still love crisps, chips and vegan cake, and don\u2019t get enough essential nutrients). They don\u2019t tend to call themselves vegan, instead referring to their diets as \u201cplant-based\u201d, and have given up meat and dairy in the same way they shun gluten; role models include super-blogger Ella Woodward and Gwyneth Paltrow.  Beyonc\u00e9, who reportedly eats a mostly plant-based diet, and husband Jay Z own shares in a vegan delivery service. \u201cThe image of veganism is undergoing the most radical change in its history, shedding tired old stereotypes,\u201d says Pierson. \u201cPeople now associate veganism with health, fitness and wellbeing, when the opposite was perhaps true a decade ago.\u201d A recent piece in Men\u2019s Journal highlighted how many Ultimate Fighting Champion fighters have gone vegan. \u201cWho\u2019s the real caveman here?\u201d Nate Diaz asked the magazine, referring to disdainful comments about his meat-free diet. \u201cWho\u2019s the real beast? [Eating predominantly raw and vegan] is more savvy and animalistic than anything. If anything, meat\u2019s gonna slow you down.\u201d     A woman with a vegan burger. Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images    Not everyone within the vegan movement is pleased with these developments, drawing a distinction between \u201cplant-based\u201d eaters and vegans. \u201cYou can eat nothing but arugula [rocket] for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but if you then throw on a pair of leather shoes and head to SeaWorld, you\u2019re not a vegan,\u201d writes Eva Lampert on the Ecorazzi site. Many people believe the emerging hypermasculine image of veganism, and its language of dominance and power, is at odds with the diet\u2019s values of compassion. How do the Vegan Bros, who have been accused of misogyny, feel about this kind of criticism? They shrug it off. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to reach these other types of people [who aren\u2019t natural converts to the vegan movement],\u201d says Phil. \u201cAnd we\u2019re reaching them effectively,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI have a really good friend who grew up on a cattle farm and now he\u2019s mostly vegan.\u201d Their argument is that the type of person who might be attracted by the Vegan Bros\u2019 punchy, profane style won\u2019t necessarily be won over by more academic, ethical (even sanctimonious) discussions about veganism.

CHICKPEAS. WHATEVERTHEFUCK YOU WANT TO CALL THEM,\u201d reads one post on their site. \u201cThese tiny bastards are filled to the brim with protein, fibre, iron, folate, B6, magnesium and all kinds of other boss nutritious shit that your body needs on the daily.\u201d You can sympathise with committed vegans who view recent converts, many of them part-timers or people who don\u2019t apply vegan principles to cosmetics or shoes, with suspicion. But they are necessary to the overall success of the movement, says Tobias Leenaert, who writes the blog The Vegan Strategist and, as co-founder of the Belgian organisation Ethical Vegan Alternative, convinced his city of Ghent to introduce a weekly vegetarian day. \u201cThe consumption of vegan products by people who are almost vegan contribute to the market and the demand,\u201d he says. \u201cMy hope is that [this] could topple the system and make it easier for everybody to go full-time vegan. If we had a critical mass, that changes the market and makes it easier for people to be full-time vegans.\u201d     UFC fighter Nate Diaz. Photograph: Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images    Appealing to the 99% of people who eat meat to go vegan on ethical grounds just doesn\u2019t work, he says; what would work is if vegan food was tasty, readily available and affordable, and increasingly became the norm. \u201cThe \u2018real\u2019 vegans, they want everybody to go vegan for the right reasons. I sympathise with that \u2013 I\u2019m a vegan for animal rights reasons \u2013 but there can be a behaviour change before there is an attitude change. There is a part of the movement which is very protective of the term \u2018vegan\u2019 and think it shouldn\u2019t apply to people who are not ethically motivated. I think that\u2019s an exclusionary tactic. I think we should welcome everybody.\u201d",
