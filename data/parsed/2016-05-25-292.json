The act granted the area \u201cknown as the Yo-Semite Valley\u201d to the state of California, to \u201cbe held for public use, resort, and recreation \u2026 inalienable for all time.\u201d It was the federal government\u2019s first act to preserve a part of nature for the common good \u2013 a precursor of the National Park Service, now enjoying its centennial \u2013 and it might not have happened but for an obscure 34-year-old named Carleton Watkins.     Cathedral Rocks, 2,600ft, Yosemite Valley, California. A stenograph card in Watkins\u2019s Pacific Coast series    Born in a small town in New York State, Watkins headed west in 1849 to seek his fortune in California\u2019s gold rush, to no avail. After apprenticing to a pioneer daguerreotypist named Robert Vance, he made his money shooting mining estates. In the summer of 1861, Watkins set out to photograph Yosemite, carrying a literal ton of equipment on mules: tripods, dark tent, lenses and a novel invention for taking sharp photographs of landscapes on glass plates nearly two feet across. Yosemite is associated with the photographs of Ansel Adams, who acknowledged Watkins as one of \u201cthe great Western photographers\u201d, but it was Watkins who first turned Half Dome, Cathedral Rocks and El Capitan into unforgettable sights. Weston Naef, a photography curator and co-author of a book about Watkins, described him as \u201cprobably the greatest American artist of his era, and hardly anyone has heard of him\u201d.     El Capitan, 3,600ft, Yosemite Valley. A stenograph card in Watkins\u2019s Pacific Coast series    Sketches and awed descriptions of Yosemite\u2019s grand views had reached the east in the mid-1800s, but nothing provoked public reaction like Watkins\u2019 photos, which were exhibited at a gallery in New York in 1862. \u201cThe views of lofty mountains, of gigantic trees, of falls of water \u2026 are indescribably unique and beautiful,\u201d the Times reported. The great landscape painter Albert Bierstadt promptly headed to Yosemite. Ralph Waldo Emerson said Watkins\u2019 images of sequoias \u201care proud curiosities here to all eyes\u201d. Watkins\u2019 works coincided with a move by California boosters to promote the state by setting aside lands in Yosemite, home to \u201cperhaps some of the greatest wonders of the world\u201d, senator John Conness bragged to Congress in 1864. Historians believe that Conness, who owned a collection of Watkins photographs and was a friend of Lincoln, showed the images to the president the year before he signed the bill protecting Yosemite.

A stenograph card in Watkins\u2019s Pacific Coast series Photograph: Carleton Watkins/Library of Congress    Watkins\u2019 fame as a photographer rose, and he journeyed throughout the west: Columbia Gorge, the Farallones, Yellowstone. But he kept returning to Yosemite. Today, it can be hard for us postmodernists, who are more used to images of wilderness than the thing itself, and who tend to associate photographs of Yosemite with clothing ads, to imagine the impact of those first vivid pictures. Yet somehow they retain their power \u2013 make us \u201clook anew at nature itself, shining with a clarity that is at once ordinary and yet very magical\u201d, says Christine Hult-Lewis, a Watkins expert. In his later years, Watkins lost his eyesight, and then his livelihood. The 1906 earthquake destroyed his studio and many of his negatives (and threw a four-year-old Ansel Adams against a wall, giving him a crooked nose). For a time Watkins lived with his wife and children in a boxcar. He died 100 years ago this month, 86 years old, broke and blind, at Napa state hospital, an asylum. Two months later, President Woodrow Wilson established the National Park Service, a steward for the sublime place Watkins had shown to a war-weary nation. \u2022 More from the Smithsonian: Artist\u2019s plan for floating piers on Lake Iseo; Secret tunnel discovered at Teotihuacan, Mexico; A World without Mosquitoes?",
