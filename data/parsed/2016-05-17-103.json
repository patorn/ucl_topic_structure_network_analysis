  "body": "Name: Doncaster Power List. Appearance: Annually, in the Doncaster Free\u00a0Press. Criterion: Being one of the town\u2019s 50 \u201ctop decision-makers, big employers and high achievers\u201d. And who decides that? \u201cAn independent panel of\u00a0local experts who really know the area \u2013 and all\u00a0it\u2019s major players.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t that be \u201cits\u201d major players? Don\u2019t quibble. All the best newspapers misspell things. So, who are Doncaster\u2019s major players in 2016? Oh, all sorts. There\u2019s Lakeside Village shopping centre manager Cheryl Sadler at No 44. Of course. And Bobbie Roberts (No 42), who is chairman of trustees at Doncaster Deaf Trust. Plus Nigel Brewster (6), co-founder of the recruitment group Brewster Pratap. It\u2019s good to see Brewster getting a top 10 place. He has slaved away in obscurity for too long. Indeed. And, of course, there\u2019s Ed Miliband.      Mayor Ros Jones, who has taken top spot once again. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Who? Ed Miliband. He\u2019s the MP for Doncaster North. Used to lead the Labour party. Wanted to\u00a0be prime minister last year. Sorry. Not ringing any bells. He ate a bacon sandwich. Ah, yes! I remember him now! He used to be really famous. Where\u2019s he on the list? No 40. Ouch. Just behind Steve Currier of Cooper Lighting (39), and some way back from Doncaster\u2019s other MPs, Caroline Flint (26) and Rosie Winterton (13). How the almost-mighty have fallen. I guess you can\u2019t be Doncaster\u2019s most powerful person every year. Oh, he wasn\u2019t in 2015, either. He was fourth. What? So three people in Doncaster were doing something more important than incompetently leading the opposition into a general election? That\u2019s right. They were the mayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones, the council chief executive, Jo Miller, and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction. Fair enough. Still, Miliband can take comfort from the words of Phil Bramley. The group editor of South Yorkshire Newspapers? That\u2019s him. He takes pains to stress that the whole list is subjective. \u201cThere are many different ways people can have influence,\u201d he points out. Quite true. One could be rich, popular, very famous, hold high office, lead a large company, inspire people with your work \u2026 Indeed. There are many, many, many ways. It\u2019s just that, after assessing evidence, a panel of independent experts reckons Miliband doesn\u2019t have much? Exactly. Do say: \u201cChoose Corbyn!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cFor the Islington Power List 2021!\u201d",
