Frederik, a 15-year-old Friesian stallion based in Arkansas, entered the public consciousness this week after people began sharing pictures of him online.  Blessed with a flowing black mane, strong torso and noble bearing, the horse was an instant hit. His supporters have described him as \u201chandsome\u201d, \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201csexy\u201d, and he has been offered film roles. \u201cThe first time I laid eyes on him,\u201d said Stacy Nazario, owner of Pinnacle Friesians, the farm Frederik calls home, \u201cI knew he was an exceptional stallion.\u201d Nazario acquired Frederik when he was six years old. She imported him from the Netherlands, where he had been co-habitating with his mother, and brought him to live with her on her farm in the Ozark mountains. \u201cHis personality went right along with his looks. He\u2019s just phenomenal. His temperament is sweet. I could put a baby right next to him and he would just be gentle with it. He\u2019s a gentle giant.\u201d While Frederik only rose to widespread fame this week, Nazario said he has had a cult following for some time. \u201cHe\u2019s always been popular with his fanbase,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore this his videos and his photographs have been all over. He\u2019s got fans from all over the world.\u201d Images from Frederik\u2019s Facebook page have been shared thousands of times, in which he demonstrates a wide range of poses. He is shown galloping through a field with his head up and chest out, proud and true, but is also seen in more reflective repose, gazing out over a wooden fence. This combination of power and sensitivity goes someway toward explaining his appeal. \u201cThere will NEVER be a more majestic, handsome, sexy horse on the face of the earth. Never, ever. I wish I could just touch and \u201csmell\u201d him just once,\u201d wrote Facebook user Sharon Younts under a picture of Frederik running wild and free.      Frederik the Great. Photograph: Facebook    \u201cHe is so stately & proud!! Magnificent!!!\u201d commented Donald Ledford, responding to a photo of Frederik rearing up on his hind legs. Nazario said Frederik, who enjoys taking part in dressage competitions, is \u201cabsolutely\u201d aware of his good looks.  \u201cHe lights up when he\u2019s in the arena or when there\u2019s photography going on. It\u2019s almost like watching a celebrity, you know, the difference between when they\u2019re at home and under the lights,\u201d Nazario said. But, she said, Frederik would not be seduced by the fickle mistress of fame. \u201cHe\u2019s that gentle and sweet of a horse, which is ingrained in his personality, that will not change.\u201d One of Frederik\u2019s most distinctive features is his long mane, which flows down almost to his fetlocks. The striking body of hair has attracted admiration from expert horse fanciers as well as casual enthusiasts. \u201cHe\u2019s very noble to look at, he has a lot of presence,\u201d said Melody Hames, a horse hairdresser who runs JMC Equestrian Custom Clippings in Lancashire, UK. \u201cYou see power but at the same time elegance.\u201d Hames praised Frederik\u2019s smooth, shiny coat, and sleek mane, a look she said could be achieved by using special horse hair conditioner, which she recommended leaving in the hair until dry. Elizabeth Moyer, editor of Horse Illustrated magazine, said Frederik the Great had all the characteristics of a handsome horse. \u201cFrom the standpoint of beauty, what makes an attractive horse: a shiny coat and a fabulous mane and hale definitely contribute to a handsome horse.  \u201cAthletic talent and beautiful movement also add to a horse\u2019s appeal. But clearly I can see a great presence and attitude [in Frederik] that has captured the attention of the general public as well as horse lovers everywhere.\u201d A busy few months lie in wait for Frederik. He has media commitments, including photo and video shoots, and Nazario is considering a couple of movie offers. The horse is also standing at stud \u2013 \u201cFrederik ships only fresh cooled semen,\u201d according to his website \u2013 and has dressage competitions coming up. On Friday afternoon, though, Frederik was content to be away from the spotlight, just a horse being a horse.  \u201cHe\u2019s just eating grass, walking around, he\u2019ll look out at the deer,\u201d Nazario said. \u201cHe loves to just relax.\u201d",
