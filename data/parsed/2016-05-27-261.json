  "body": "Deep in the filth, squashed under the weight of the American dream, three men with crazy names (Troy, Mad Dog and Diesel) scrabble for space. Try as they might, the gangsters at the heart of Paul Schrader\u2019s latest are damned. Down they go, still clinging to the hope of one last, redemptive job, digging on deep to the gates of hell. Dog Eat Dog, which was let off the leash at last week\u2019s Cannes film festival, is a hard-scrap story. Based on the book by former criminal, writer and actor Eddie Bunker (who played Reservoir Dogs\u2019s Mr Blue), it\u2019s set and shot among the strip malls and dive bars of post-crash Cleveland. Nicolas Cage stars as Troy, a once-wealthy heir whose fortunes have crumbled. Eager to rejoin the straight world, Troy enlists the help of two jail buddies, a soulful lunk called Diesel (Christopher Matthew Cook) and a garrulous psychotic known as Mad Dog (Willem Dafoe). The trio are going to kidnap the baby of a wealthy family and hold the kid to ransom. Shot as if scenes from Godard, Cassavetes, Tarantino and Aardman had been spun in a tombola, Dog Eat Dog operates on a creative plain that\u2019s as strange and corrupted as Mad Dog\u2019s morality. Schrader opens with a pink-hued drug sequence in which Dafoe\u2019s character, hopped up on cocaine and hearing voices, murders his girlfriend and her young daughter over an argument about a borrowed car. Raising Arizona this is not. \u201cI thought it would be interesting to just really do the nasty,\u201d says Schrader. He says Dog Eat Dog was inspired by \u201cthe post-rules generation\u201d. \u201cYou can do most anything now,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can shoot a scene in black and white, one in colour, one tinted and the audience will say, \u2018Hey, cool.\u2019 Animation. Stop\u2013motion. We have a generation of viewers that have been rewired and re-educated on multimedia technology. Their brains fire at a different rate. When they see those movies from the 70s they think, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s a slow movie.\u2019\u201d     \u2018We have a generation of viewers that has been re-wired and re-educated on multimedia technology\u2019 \u2026 Paul Schrader. Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP    Among the \u201cslow\u201d: Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The Last Temptation of Christ, all of which Schrader wrote. But while vaunted as a screenwriter, the 69-year-old has had legendary trouble getting his directorial projects made. In 2003 he was fired after a completing an Exorcist prequel. The studio hated it, demonised him and hired a new writer and director to bring about a resurrection. In 2013, a revelatory New York Times article from the set of the Kickstarter-funded The Canyons described Schrader\u2019s exhausting efforts to coax a cohesive performance out of porn actor James Deen and a fresh-from-rehab Lindsay Lohan. Then, in 2014, Schrader\u2019s thriller Dying of the Light, which starred Cage and Anton Yelchin, was \u2013 according to a Facebook campaign rallying support \u2013 \u201ctaken away\u201d from Schrader by its producers. It was, the director says, \u201ca particularly ugly experience\u201d. The failures and frustrations took their toll. \u201cSome fear Lohan will end him,\u201d wrote the Times in their Canyons expose. She didn\u2019t, but someone or something has had a decent go. Schrader, breathless and tired, enters the room searching for coffee that will never show. He speaks in a croaky growl that shakes the tabletop. Gradually, carefully, he loosens up, peppering the conversation with jive talk (\u201ccats\u201d, \u201cmojo\u201d). He sheds the gruffness, revealing a well-polished cynic underneath. He\u2019s down on the crime genre (\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tired films out there\u201d), our PC culture (\u201cIf art is not allowed to be distasteful and vulgar, we\u2019re in trouble\u201d) and America (\u201cA false promise to begin with\u201d). But he cares about his films and will fight for them. The director\u2019s at his best in a tight spot, says Dafoe, who has appeared in seven of Schrader\u2019s films. He remembers a poster that hung in the director\u2019s office during the Dog Eat Dog shoot: \u201cThe price of freedom is not having enough stuff.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the low-budget cheapness of the production that expresses the cheapness of the life,\u201d says Dafoe. \u201cThat\u2019s not calculated, that just happened. For example, Cleveland was once a very powerful, wealthy place. It\u2019s where John Rockefeller came from. It fell on hard times like a lot of cities in the industrial midwest. It\u2019s got such a fighter spirit to it, but it\u2019s funky. There\u2019s a texture to that world that we took advantage of.\u201d Nearly all of Schrader\u2019s stories show a country that has pushed the little guy to breaking point. His heroes \u2013 a burned out paramedic (Bringing Out the Dead), a washed-up fighter (Raging Bull), a desperate war vet (Taxi Driver\u2019s Travis Bickle) \u2013 are poor and defeated. Real-life delivers these characters to him, he says. They are the people America has made. You can\u2019t help but be inspired. \u201cThe political environment can\u2019t not affect how you make a film,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that we now have a caricature running for the US presidency has to affect it, because it affects how people see things. The fact that a clown can run legitimately for the highest office in our country affects how you view clown-like characters in movies too.\u201d     A strange and corrupted film \u2026 Cage in Dog Eat Dog    He gives a big sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s got enough people to feed that ego,\u201d he says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need me.\u201d Trump\u2019s on the loose. America is in freefall. Troy, Mad Dog and Diesel are doomed. Is there nothing that inspires even a bit hope? \u201cI don\u2019t think you can be hopeful about human endeavour,\u201d he says, allowing a grin. \u201cYou can only be hopeful about post-human life. Once you get into shedding off this carbon-based skin \u2026 maybe things will get better.\u201d",
