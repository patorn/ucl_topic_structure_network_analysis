  "body": "A mosque in Geelong, 75km south of Melbourne, Victoria, was destroyed in a suspicious fire on Wednesday morning. Police say the fire was reported at 2.15am after a nearby resident heard a loud bang. The resident went to investigate and saw the mosque alight. \u201cAt this stage it appears the fire is suspicious and a crime scene has been established,\u201d Sen Const Julie-Anne Newman said. \u201cNo one was injured.\u201d   Related: Mosque opposed by far-right political groups likely to be blocked    Newman said the arson chemist returned to the site with detectives later on Tuesday. Two weeks ago a Greek Orthodox church in East Melbourne, the oldest in Australia, was damaged in what was also believed to be a suspicious fire. There have also been four church fires in the Geelong area in the past six months. The Country Fire Authority said they did not know if the fires were connected. The mosque, on Bostock Avenue, is housed in an old bluestone church, but has operated as a mosque for 23 years. Shaykh Mohammad Ramzan, the iman of the Geelong mosque, told ABC radio he was in \u201cdisbelief and shock\u201d. He and his family live in the adjacent house but escaped unharmed. Ramzan said the mosque had not had any threats in the past. \u201cIn the last 23 years, and I am here from the last four years, we have never ever had any threat, any letter, any phone call, which says anything bad about the mosque or the muslim community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very peaceful and nice area and community.\u201d He said the Islamic Council of Geelong would rebuild the mosque, and would not be deterred even if the mosque had been deliberately targeted. \u201cOur community is very peaceful and we will remain peaceful and we will show patience and tolerance and we will take it as something not done by the community with any purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be something done by someone who wants us to be divided \u2026 we will not play into the hand of anyone who has such a bad intention.\u201d  A spokesman for the CFA said the fire had spread throughout the building by the time firefighters arrived, and could not be controlled. It took an hour to contain. \u201cThere were a couple of concerns with the structure potentially falling down so we didn\u2019t put crews inside the building,\u201d CFA officer Mark Sinkinson told the ABC. \u201cThe roof had completely fallen in anyway.\u201d Video of the fire, posted on Facebook, showed flames pouring out of the roof. Inspector Graham Banks, from Geelong police, told ABC radio that most of the churches targeted in suspected arson attacks had been of various Christian denominations, and police were not ruling out the possibility that the mosque had been targeted in a case of mistaken identity.  Banks said that some neighbours didn\u2019t know the building was a mosque.",
