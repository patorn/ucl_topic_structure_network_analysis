  "body": "The outgoing central bank governor, Glenn Stevens, has declared whomever wins the federal election on 2 July will inherit substantial heavy lifting on budget repair, as the campaign descended into a day of partisan finger-pointing about budget \u201cblack holes\u201d. In comments anticipated to be his final public intervention before leaving the Reserve Bank of Australia, Stevens said the bank concurred with updated forecasts produced by Treasury last week about the state of the nation\u2019s books but he said the official outlook amounted to everything is OK as long as nothing goes wrong.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, started the day by branding the Labor leader \u201cbillion-dollar Bill\u201d before ramping up the theme Labor was making spending promises it couldn\u2019t afford. At a media conference in Canberra at lunchtime, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, declared the budget blowout over the forward estimates amounted to $66.9bn. Labor was increasing taxes, and none of the revenue was going to deficit reduction. \u201cAll of these additional taxes are being used to chase higher and higher levels of public spending,\u201d Morrison said.     In comments anticipated to be his final public intervention before leaving the Reserve Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens said he would prefer economic growth to be higher.

One example of the black hole inflation was including Labor\u2019s long-term aspiration to restore $19bn of foreign aid cuts. The shadow finance spokesman, Tony Burke, later told reporters voters had just watched the government\u2019s two economic spokesmen, Morrison and Cormann, \u201cthe two people who were meant to be in charge of accuracy in numbers for our nation, basically blindfolded, throw darts at the Labor party\u201d. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, described the attack as \u201cdesperate\u201d and told reporters there were two competing visions on offer at this election. There was the Coalition\u2019s \u201ctrickle down\u201d economics, \u201cwhere you look after the top 1 and 2% and hope everyone else gets something on the way through, or Labor\u2019s plan to look after working-class and middle-class families, good education, good health, good jobs. That is the most sustainable way to generate economic growth in the long term.\u201d \u201cMr Turnbull\u2019s spending people\u2019s money,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cHe is just not spending it on Australians.\u201d Stevens also defended the RBA\u2019s system of inflation targeting, rejecting calls from some economists for a rethink of the system. He said inflation targeting was \u201cnot a rigid thing that demands kneejerk reactions\u201d, it was a system with sufficient flexibility to deliver what was required. Stevens noted many approaches had been tried but the current system had worked and \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want to be without it\u201d.

Stevens said there was no easy road to riches through highly leveraged investments in real estate. The outgoing governor was also asked about China\u2019s economic transformation. He noted Beijing was \u201ctrying to manage a profound epochal transition\u201d and there was no textbook for how to do that, because no country had ever attempted the transformation that China was attempting on the scale it was attempting. Stevens said there was a threshold question for Australia \u2013 can the authorities in China land this transition \u2013 and this would be \u201ca threshold question we will live with for some years\u201d.",
