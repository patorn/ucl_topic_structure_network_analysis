  "body": "The British government\u2019s claim that Saudi Arabia\u2019s bombing campaign in Yemen has not breached international humanitarian law is \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d and contributes to an \u201canything goes\u201d attitude from the opposing sides in the conflict, the international development select committee has said. The finding comes as a rebuke to the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, who made the assessment despite a UN-sponsored report and many charities presenting evidence to the contrary. The Conservative-dominated committee said the Saudi inquiry into the Yemen campaign, supported by the Foreign Office, was inadequate and called for an independent inquiry. \u201cIt is deeply disappointing that the UK government does not accept that breaches of international humanitarian law have taken place in Yemen,\u201d the committee said in a report. \u201cThe failure to hold parties to the conflict to account for their actions appears to have contributed to an \u2018anything goes\u2019 attitude by both sides to this conflict.\u201d Saudi Arabia entered the Yemeni civil war in March 2015 at the head of a coalition supporting the government against Shia Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh. About 6,400 people, half of them civilians, were killed in the first year of the Saudi intervention, according to World Health Organization figures, and 2.5 million were displaced.  The MPs\u2019 report, published on Wednesday, found that \u201cthere was clear evidence [that] international humanitarian law is being breached, making the relief effort difficult and dangerous. Schools, health and vital water and nutrition supplies are at risk, while the civilian population bears the brunt of the fighting. Yemen faces one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with 82% of the population in need of assistance\u201d. But in a sign of the sensitivity of UK-Saudi relations, Conservative MPs on the committee blocked a call for Britain\u2019s highly profitable arms sales to Saudi Arabia to be suspended pending clear evidence that the air campaign in Yemen was targeting civilians. The six Conservatives on the 11-member committee voted for UK weapons sales to be referred to a separate committee specialising in arms exports. In correspondence with the committee, Hammond set out a series of reasons why the government believes that there is no case for revoking licences issued to arms exporters. He said the Saudi-led coalition was not targeting civilians; Saudi Arabia\u2019s processes and procedures were in place to ensure respect for the principles of international humanitarian law; and the kingdom was investigating incidents of concern, including those involving civilian casualties.  \u201cSaudi Arabia has throughout engaged in constructive dialogue with the UK about both its processes and incidents of concern,\u201d Hammond told the committee. \u201cSaudi Arabia has been and remains genuinely committed to [international humanitarian law] compliance\u201d. David Mepham, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, said in response that multiple attacks on markets, hospitals, schools and private homes had been documented in violation of the laws of war.  \u201cHammond misleadingly claims the Saudis have procedures in place to ensure adherence to the laws of war and investigate incidents of concern,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the reality is one of ongoing, large-scale violations by the Saudis in Yemen that have continued for over a year and a refusal by the Saudis either to acknowledge these violations or properly investigate them.\u201d A Saudi internal inquiry into the Yemen campaign, set up in January in response to international criticism, has not yet published any findings. The Foreign Office minister, Tobias Ellwood, said last week that he had contacted the Saudi ambassador to the UK to complain that the inquiry was taking an excessively long time.  The MPs\u2019 report said it remained \u201cunconvinced that Saudi Arabia is best placed to conduct investigations into reports of [international humanitarian law] abuses by the Saudi-led coalition. It is a longstanding principle of the rule of law that inquiries should be independent of those being investigated\u201d. In separate evidence last week, the minister for defence procurement, Philip Dunne, revealed for the first time that British officials stationed in Riyadh had access to reports compiled by the Saudi air force into its air raids. He said the UK government advises the Saudi air force on general air campaign tactics, but not individual targets. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, called on the British government to reveal the findings of UK officials in Riyadh. \u201cA Conservative-controlled select committee has found, unlike the foreign secretary, that there are breaches of international humanitarian law by the Saudis using UK weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cDue to the absence of an independent inquiry, and the failure of the Saudi government, acknowledged by the Foreign Office, to publish its findings of its inquiry, it is time [for] the foreign secretary to publish details of what UK government officials have found about the Saudi bombing campaign.  \u201cWe now need to know what UK officials based in Riyadh are reporting back to their political masters back in London. Otherwise the only conclusion is that Britain is colluding in breaches of humanitarian law and Hammond is covering this up.\u201d",
