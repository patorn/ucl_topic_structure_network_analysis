Now Boris Johnson has talked himself into controversy by likening the European Union\u2019s supposed intention to create a superstate to Hitler\u2019s political ambitions.  The reaction to Johnson\u2019s ahistorical claim was utterly predictable. It set the EU referendum news agenda for a day... but it proved to be of dubious value to the Brexit campaign. Throughout Sunday, the airwaves hummed to the sound of fury by Johnson\u2019s opponents and evident frustration by his supporters as they struggled to defend him on TV and radio news bulletins and current affairs programmes.   Related: German readers say Johnson's EU-Hitler comments are just 'British hysteria'    National newspaper editors joined the fray on Monday. But there was a noticeable lack of enthusiasm. The Daily Telegraph ran only a short news piece on \u201cthe row\u201d generatedby Johnson\u2019s interview with its Sunday title. And Johnson made no mention of it in his regular column. Two titles favouring Leave - the Daily Mail and the Sun - sought to claim there was logic to the Johnson argument. Those advocating Remain poured scorn on it, and on Boris himself.  The Times, the Rupert Murdoch title engaged in the delicate process of switching from Euroscepticism to Europhilia, savaged the man who affects to lead the Brexiteers. \u201cThe tang of his own shoe leather is perhaps not an unfamiliar taste for Boris Johnson\u201d, it began, adding:  \u201cLife is too short to waste much of it seeking to place the utterances of Mr Johnson anywhere on a sliding scale between calculation and gaffe.\u201d   It thought the hyperbolic Nazi reference was \u201cnonsense\u201d. But the Times saw it in the context of an increasingly degraded debate, concluding: \u201cLeave Hitler out of it.\u201d  The Mail overcame its obvious embarrassment by offering muted support to Johnson. It conceded that \u201cinvoking the ghosts of Hitler and the Nazis in any political argument is a profoundly dangerous strategy.\u201d But it went on to defend Johnson for playing \u201ca risky card\u201d and argued that \u201cbeyond all the sound and fury\u201d there was a point to his claim that the EU \u201cis acting like the totalitarian regimes of the past and trampling on the rights and wishes of ordinary citizens.\u201d It concluded with a rhetorical question: \u201cIs this really a cynical, hysterical argument, or simply the voice of logic and common sense?\u201d The Sun gave unequivocal backing to Johnson for making \u201cthe reasonable point that various people had tried and failed to unify the \u00adcountries of Europe \u2014 including \u00adNapoleon and Hitler.\u201d It said his Remain camp critics \u201cexploded in fake outrage\u201d and \u201cconfected fury.\u201d Saying that dictators in the past have called for \u201cever closer union\u201d in Europe \u201cis both truthful and a point worth making.\u201d The Daily Express gave Johnson\u2019s statement a double-page headline, \u201cBoris: EU wants a superstate, just like Hitler\u201d, but refrained from comment. Its leading article on the EU debate - \u201cthe devastating impact that mass migration has had on this country\u201d - hammered away at its familiar anti-migrant theme. The Guardian\u2019s leading article explored the referendum debate\u2019s \u201cdescent beyond hyperbole into hysteria\u201d and pointed to each side\u2019s accusations that the other one is \u201cpeddling bogus statistics and ramping up baseless fear.\u201d Turning to Johnson, it saw his \u201cugly and provocative allusion to the Third Reich as a metaphor for European integration\u201d as \u201ca move from the Donald Trump playbook - maximising controversy in order to dominate the conversation and drown out reasonable debate.\u201d It also took the opportunity to forge a split between Johnson and his fellow Brexiteers:  \u201cMr Johnson is not famed for consistency or integrity, but there are other senior Conservatives... the likes of Michael Gove and Michael Howard... who combine sincere Euroscepticism with a conscientious view of public life as entailing responsibilities.  They should be alarmed by the direction the campaign they endorse is taking. A question they, and other moderate Eurosceptics, should face, is how much poison they are prepared to see tipped into the well of reasonable public debate in pursuit of a goal - Britain outside the EU.\u201d  The Daily Mirror, having persuaded Cameron to contribute an \u201chistoric guest column\u201d urging readers to vote Remain, gave it, rather than Johnson\u2019s Hitler analogy, front page billing. But the paper didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to deride Johnson with a spread headlined \u201cReich Charlie\u201d over a picture of Boris with his hand stretched out as if giving a Nazi-style salute.  And its political columnist, Kevin Maguire, laid into the \u201cincreasingly unhinged\u201d Johnson, calling him \u201cBritain\u2019s Donald Trump\u201d who \u201cspouts poison about Germans with the wild prejudice of a Hooray gulping once too often from the port bottle at a Bullingdon reunion.\u201d",
