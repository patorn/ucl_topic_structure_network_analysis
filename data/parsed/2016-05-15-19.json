  "body": "Oh no! It\u2019s all over! It\u2019s time for Indian Summers to be a bedtime story. Were we ever really here at all \u2013 or were they just pulling our legs? It took the Britishers a very long time to understand anything about what was going on in India, but at least they seem to have got it in the end. They\u2019re not bloody welcome any more. If only they\u2019d got the message ages ago.  Alice left with a frozen expression in white gloves, saving Aafrin\u2019s life but signing her own death warrant. But what\u2019s this remarkable coincidence? The town where she is overnighting is under siege \u2013 and it\u2019s Ralphie and Aafrin to the rescue!      It\u2019s Ralphie and Aafrin to the rescue! Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4     It was only ever a mob that was going to be able to finish off Mr Charlie, but it was good to see Alice play her part in his downfall. I do hope she and Aafrin will be able to save up lots of money for Percy\u2019s therapy. I did feel sorry for that poor boy having to return to the Adultery Cave of Doom. That\u2019s right, Alice, say in a loud voice in front of your child: \u201cI did it. I killed him.\u201d I know Mr Charlie was dysfunctional and psychopathic and arguably deserved to die, but none of this can really be a happy ending, can it? When you\u2019ve just seen your father slaughtered in front of your eyes? Never mind, though \u2013 here\u2019s a nice wedding feast we can gatecrash! I hope they\u2019ve got some hot food left! There was a lot we had to overlook here in favour of the feelgood factor. Had Sooni\u2019s parents finally made peace with the fact that she is not going to be married off to Eyebrow Man? Oh no. They\u2019re still in with the Eyebrows. \u201cYou sister is a Muslim now.\u201d Oh dear. And now she\u2019s called Leila! \u201cI don\u2019t think I know any such a person. Do you, Daddy?\u201d Fantastic scene. Well done, everyone, especially the little sister: \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d Meanwhile, on the other side of town... it\u2019s wonderful Mr Khan! I would do anything he asked. Just call me Leila. I know we\u2019ve run out of time but I\u2019m intrigued as to what Mr Khan\u2019s family\u2019s reaction would have been to Sooni marrying their son. Surely they would have been just as annoyed?      Wasn\u2019t the auction all a bit sudden and odd? Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4     As for the auction: wasn\u2019t this all a bit sudden and odd? Did I miss an episode? I know Ralphie hasn\u2019t become the Viceroy and that he can\u2019t afford to pay the house back ... but ... is he sacked? Ah, here it comes. The resignation letter. \u201cYou\u2019d be setting me free.\u201d But how come he is still going to be living in the house while Cynthia is leaving the house? Really, I give up. As usual there was a lot of great acting in this episode and some truly moving moments, not least Aafrin\u2019s father: \u201cI can\u2019t give her up.\u201d But also as usual it was all over the place and nothing was really advanced or sewn up. I imagine when it was filmed it was supposed to be a temporary conclusion setting the scene for series three in which ... what? Ralphie makes his amazing comeback? Aafrin decides to join Team Mahatma? The ghost of Mr Charlie firebombs the entire subcontinent? We\u2019ll never know.     Aafrin\u2019s father has a wobble over the wedding of Sooni, sorry, Leila. Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4     I\u2019ll miss the sumptuous beauty of the cinematography, some fine performances and Cynthia\u2019s dove-concealing turban. But I\u2019ll never forgive them for wasting Art Malik and Rachel Griffiths, and for not really making that much sense ever. Farewell, members of Club Simla. We raise a glass to you (before smashing it defiantly on the patio). Political shenanigans Moving forward hand-in-hand towards the ultimate goal of self-government! Huzzah! \u201cI have heard your speech. Since it is always the same.\u201d There was at least a moment of decent exposition here from the new British man. So they\u2019re still failing to grasp the basic problem that India is on the brink of civil war and all the Brits can really do is be \u2013 as Aafrin put it \u2013 policemen. It would have been fascinating to see how all this would have played out over the further three series that were planned. Presumably Ralphie would have swapped sides at some point and taken up the revolutionary cause. But this episode illustrated one of Indian Summers\u2019 perennial problems: it was a show about politics that really failed to make us understand or care that much about politics. Evil Britisher of the week Mr Ian made a brief play for King Evil with his moment of madness in Ralphie\u2019s bedroom. Had he overdosed on vitamin C? I\u2019ve never seen him so frisky. I was even more shocked to see him overlook the cutlery pilfering.  This is small fry next to Mr Charlie\u2019s catalogue of horror, though. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just pop along?\u201d...\u201cNow do you see? Do you see?\u201d Poor Aafrin. I don\u2019t know where Mr Charlie gets the strength. And then in his vest in the back of the car ... oh evil Mr Charlie. What will do you now that you\u2019ve got what you wanted? Make a Hindu chauffeur insult a cow by driving round it? That is going to be a mistake, my friend ... Series verdict: Mr Charlie remains Head of Evil \u2013 and just as Tom Hiddleston is surely a shoo-in for the next 007, surely Blake Ritson has given the best ever audition for the all-time Bond villain? I look forward to seeing more of him. This has been a virtuoso role. The Julie Walters Fan Club     Bye bye, Cynthia, you were class in a show stuffed with class. Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4    \u201cIn it goes! Thrust and parry!\u201d 150,000 rupees! 200,000 rupees! 300! 400! \u201cMrs Coffin ... I\u2019m going to have to sell ...\u201d Cynthia is giving up the club to some non-Britishers! I was surprised she went so quietly, to be honest. \u201cI came to an arrangement ... We swapped the deeds around.\u201d Of course. She said nothing because she knew she could get what she wanted. It\u2019s a shame we haven\u2019t had a proper resolution here over the relationship between Ralphie and Cynthia, but that\u2019s what happens when your series doesn\u2019t get recommissioned. I still maintain that she would somehow have turned out to be his mother, no matter what has gone before. (I know, I know, he\u2019s just her proxy son and it\u2019s all about a sort of weird revenge on her syphilitic husband, Ralphie\u2019s father). But now that can never be. Bye bye, Cynthia, you were class in a series full of class.",
