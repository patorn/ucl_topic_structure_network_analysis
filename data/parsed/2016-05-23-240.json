  "body": "A private economic consultancy was planning to release modelling of Labor\u2019s negative gearing policies next week, to warn voters that the ALP\u2019s proposals will \u201ccreate market chaos\u201d and be \u201cdifficult to police,\u201d but a leaked copy of the report has thwarted its plans. The modelling \u2013 still in initial draft form \u2013 tries to discredit Labor\u2019s plan to limit negative gearing to new properties and cut the capital gains discount from 50% to 25%, saying it will see established house prices fall by 3% to 4%. The modelling was prepared by Brian Haratsis, MacroPlanDimasi\u2019s executive chairman and a member of the Property Council of Australia, who is a friend of Greg Paramor, a former chairman of the Property Council. Paramor, who is a friend of the treasurer, Scott Morrison, reportedly made the request to Haratis after meeting with Morrison recently, saying he wanted a study critiquing Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy. The modelling was scheduled to be released next week, but a draft copy was sent to Guardian Australia and Fairfax Media before that could happen. Guardian Australia asked Haratis on Monday if the modelling had been commissioned by Paramor or Morrison, or anyone in the Liberal party. He said it had not and maintained it was independent. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been commissioned by anybody. We\u2019re just a research house and I was just preparing the paper,\u201d Haratis said. The paper criticises recent modelling by the Grattan Institute, saying the institute has sought to \u201costracise\u201d high-income individuals by using tax office data to show that high-income earners are direct beneficiaries of the capital gains tax (CGT) discount.   Related: Today's campaign: Turnbull slumps in polls as Labor maintains strong start    It says the Grattan Institute\u2019s modelling should have analysed the housing benefits of the CGT and negative gearing to low-income renters, rather than focusing on the tax benefits alone. \u201c[Their] findings that most of the tax benefit [of CGT] accrued to high-income individuals was to be expected because of their wealth and access to capital,\u201d the modelling says. \u201cThe broader spectrum of lower-income individuals negatively gearing and utilising the CGT discount was the real news.\u201d   An initial draft, dated April 16, is titled \u201cShort Memory\u201d, but it suggests an alternative title could be \u201cShortened Memory\u201d When contacted on Monday, Haratsis said he has been modelling Labor\u2019s policies, as well as recent work by the Grattan Institute and the Australian Council of Social Service because he wanted to know what effect they would have on low-income renters.       \u201cI tried to pull together all of the policies that are out there at the moment and put them together in the context of the Henry tax review,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Henry review said you shouldn\u2019t touch capital gains tax unless you\u2019ve fixed the broader policy context, which is stamp duty and capital gains tax, at the same time. The Reserve Bank says the same thing. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to look at the effects [of Labor\u2019s policies] on low-income rental displacement, which is probably the biggest issue ... because no one\u2019s tackled that.\u201d The modelling \u2013 which Haratsis says is not complete \u2013 claims Labor\u2019s policies will cost Australia\u2019s renters $1.7bn a year in extra rental costs. It then predicts three dramatic impacts on the economy. Firstly, it says Labor\u2019s policies would reduce the number of negative gearing landlords by 1m over the next decade, with direct consequences for 45% of the country\u2019s 2.25m renting households. This would increase rents by 8.8% for these negatively geared dwellings, it says. Secondly, it claims the policy would remove 205,000 dwellings from the rental housing supply stock, requiring an immediate increase in social housing to replace the fall in low-income rental stock. Thirdly, it would create a \u201cresale price cliff\u201d for apartments that have been purchased off the plan. It says this \u201cprice cliff\u201d will be driven by the inability of first home owners to resell their properties to a negative gearing landlord. It also warns Labor\u2019s policies will force low-income rental households out of established areas with jobs, facilities and public transport into \u201couter fringe areas\u201d in new dwellings with no jobs, public transport or facilities.

On Monday he released an analysis of tax office data \u2013 produced by the tax policy unit in his office \u2013 showing Labor\u2019s negative gearing policies would hurt low and middle-income households more than high-income households, contrary to Labor\u2019s claims. The focus on the \u201cunfairness\u201d of Labor\u2019s policy is very different from the government\u2019s focus of previous weeks. Until now, Morrison and Turnbull have emphasising how Labor\u2019s policies will lead to property price crashes and soaring rents. This modelling comes two months after BIS Shrapnel released modelling showing plans to restrict negative gearing to new homes would see rents jump by up to 10% in capital cities, and property prices fall 6% within 10 years. Morrison seized on the BIS modelling at the time, describing it as \u201can indictment on Labor\u2019s policy\u201d. \u201cWhat it shows is [that] they just haven\u2019t done their homework on this,\u201d Morrison said. He later came under fire after BIS Shrapnel clarified that its modelling was prepared before Labor\u2019s policy was announced.",
