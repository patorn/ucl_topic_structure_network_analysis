  "body": "Corinne Bailey Rae\u2019s luxuriant third album\u00a0marks another rebirth, after The Sea (2010) soundtracked a period of mourning for the Leeds native\u2019s first husband. Rich with on-point retro-futurist sounds, such as the gem-like, sultry neo-soul of Green Aphrodisiac, written with fellow travellers King, this Rae\u00a0opus\u00a0also boasts hyper-digital delights in the superlative single Been to\u00a0the Moon and\u00a0Tell Me. But there\u2019s some\u00a0unwelcome\u00a0pandering to all markets\u00a0in ghastly guitar ballad Stop Where You Are, a misstep looking for a Coldplay album, and\u00a0a couple of tracks where smoothness\u00a0wins out over personality.",
