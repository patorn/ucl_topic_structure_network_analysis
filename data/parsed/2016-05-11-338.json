The prime minister made his first trip to the heartland, home to seven marginal seats: Lindsay, Macquarie and Macarthur (all Liberal-held) and Greenway, Werriwa, Parramatta and McMahon (Labor). He met the MP for Lindsay, Fiona Scott, in Penrith for morning tea with a small group of mothers and small business owners. She holds the seat with a margin of 3% and Labor\u2019s Emma Husar \u2013 a former Labor staffer, disability advocate and lifelong resident of the region \u2013 poses strong opposition. Scott was later quizzed by reporters over whether she voted for Turnbull or his predecessor in the Liberal spill last year. She refused to answer, insisting her moral code stopped her from leaking from within the party room. The prime minister was under no misapprehensions about the importance of winning a seat that has gone with government since 1984. \u201cIf we hold this seat, then we will be returned to government,\u201d he told reporters. In the campaign three years ago, Scott was lauded by the then opposition leader, Tony Abbott, for having \u201ca bit of sex appeal\u201d. Today Turnbull was at pains to stress her \u201cunderstanding of business ... [and] economics\u201d.    Scott asked to declare her vote in the spill. \"The solidarity of the party room is absolutely crucial,\" she says pic.twitter.com/Ch9RXkaClY\u2014 michael safi (@safimichael) May 11, 2016    Turnbull later cancelled a scheduled walkthrough \u2013 according to Ray Hadley (via BuzzFeed) because he \u201cwasn\u2019t happy with the line of questioning\u201d of Scott. But the prime minister\u2019s staff say it was simply because he was behind schedule. Apart from the daily public event and a short press conference, we\u2019ve heard very little from Turnbull thus far in the campaign, as Katharine Murphy noted in the blog.  To my knowledge Malcolm Turnbull has not done one interview this week \u2013 not radio, not regional radio, not television, not newspapers. That is quite an unusual way to launch on the hustings \u2026 Perhaps he\u2019s still thinking about things. Thinking about things is not a bad thing, of course.  But maybe he could stand to be a bit more visible in the media. Greeting passengers on the train to western Sydney, Turnbull came face-to-face with one commuter who had no idea who he was. Even better, it was captured on video. Is this Twitter\u2019s next Duncan Storrar?

On Tuesday the conservative thinktank revealed it was gearing up to campaign against the government over its planned changes to super taxes and concessions, believed to be retrospective, which had caused an \u201cabsolute firestorm\u201d among Coalition supporters and IPA members.  But Turnbull has refused to bow to the mounting pressure to make any changes to his super policies. \u201cNo. The super changes are set out in the budget,\u201d he said today. \u201c[Be] very, very clear. It is not retrospective at all.\u201d He also denied the Liberal party\u2019s deputy leader, Julie Bishop, had hinted at a possible change to the super package in response to the pressure from opponents when she said the government would have a \u201cconsultation period\u201d. \u201cWhat Julie was referring to was the process of consultation that always goes on with changes like this about the technicalities of the drafting [of legislation],\u201d he said. Simon Breheny, the IPA\u2019s director of policy, told Guardian Australia the government was being \u201ctoo clever by half\u201d to claim that its measures weren\u2019t retrospective. Dirty deals, done by seats? The question of a Labor-Greens coalition rumbles, despite the former\u2019s best efforts to dismiss it out of hand \u2013 even gaining momentum with every utterance of \u201cLabor governs alone or not at all\u201d. But multiple members of the Greens have said they\u2019d be open to working with the party in the event of a hung parliament.  Burke said he wouldn\u2019t rule out going back to the polls if it was either that or form a government with the Greens. Bill Shorten certainly wouldn\u2019t go that far when asked about it in Mackay this morning, where he announced $4.6m to support targeted teaching. \u201cWe want to win this election,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cThe only way you can have a second election is if there\u2019s a not a clear outcome in the first election.\u201d It\u2019s too early to say what will happen, which is perhaps the thinking behind the Daily Telegraph\u2019s \u201ccaptains\u2019 solemn pledges\u201d, signed by Shorten and Turnbull, that neither will strike a deal with the Greens \u2013 to call them out at a later date.    Daily Tele has done up \"solemn pledges\" for the leaders about not doing deals with the Greens pic.twitter.com/k6RJvdHTvH\u2014 Bridie Jabour (@bkjabour) May 10, 2016    The Tele today endorsed Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese, a.k.a. DJ Albo, in the seat of Grayndler \u2013 at least, if the alternative\u2019s a \u201cradical who wants to overthrow capitalism\u201d. (The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young on Sky News: \u201cI\u2019m not sure the endorsement of the Murdoch rag is going to help.\u201d) The Tele reported that the Liberals were in negotiations with the Greens over preference swaps in Labor\u2019s key marginal seats. But Turnbull told the ABC that he won\u2019t be making any announcements over next few days because \u201cthe campaign is still in its infancy\u201d. Watch this space.

And also ... Scott Morrison, the treasurer, has faced questions in Launceston over the government\u2019s emissions reductions targets. Asked about its commitment to its Direct Action policy to limit the impact of climate change, Morrison had what BuzzFeed Australia dubbed \u201cone of the most headache-inducing political answers of all time\u201d, captured on Vine by Stephanie Anderson.         You what?    On Tuesday the environment department put out its quarterly update of Australia\u2019s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which showed that emissions had gone up again. Guardian Australia environment reporter Michael Slezak asked Greg Hunt\u2019s office when he expected the upward trajectory to stop. The response he received was another reminder that we\u2019re in election time:  Emissions in 2015 were 100m tonnes lower than Labor had forecast they would be under their system. Emissions in 2020 are now predicted to be 116m tonnes lower than Labor had forecast they would be ...  I\u2019m hoping these facts will be reported.  Consider it done!

The \u201cgolden era\u201d of UK-China relations appears to have lost some of its glitter after the Queen privately accused Chinese officials of being \u201cvery rude\u201d to the British ambassador during president Xi Jinping\u2019s first state visit to Britain last year.           \u2018Very rude\u2019: Queen\u2019s unguarded comments on Chinese officials during UK visit    And if today was a pop song ...

Unsurprisingly, given the media contingent in tow, she was voxpopped about her views on the election. At her request, the Guardian Australia reporter Michael Safi photographed only the back of her head. Quote the Zombies\u2019 1965 hit: She\u2019s Not There.         No one told you about her, except, you know, Guardian Australia.
