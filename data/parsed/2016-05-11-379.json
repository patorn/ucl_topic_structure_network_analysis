  "body": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s resounding loss in West Virginia on Tuesday may not mean much for her delegate count, but that there\u2019s plenty to worry those concerned with optics. After all, just eight years ago, she beat Obama in the overwhelmingly white state of West Virginia by one of the biggest margins of the primary season. This year it was she who lost in a landslide to Bernie Sanders. The trouble for the Clinton naysayers here is that she doesn\u2019t need to win over white America to become the next president. She doesn\u2019t even need to come close. In 2012, Obama lost white men to Mitt Romney, 35% to 62%. He also lost white women, 42% to Romney\u2019s 56%. Clinton\u2019s numbers with women will likely be better, and the proportion of the electorate that\u2019s white has gotten smaller since 2012. Trump may well beat her handily among white people. But, quite simply, if Clinton keeps her command with minorities and women, it won\u2019t matter. That hasn\u2019t stopped outlets like the New York Times from making the case that Clinton has a serious problem with white men that could keep her from winning a general election. \u201cWhile Mrs Clinton swept the five major primaries on Tuesday, she lost white men in all of them, and by double-digit margins in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls showed \u2013 a sharp turnabout from 2008,\u201d the Times observed earlier this spring. But there\u2019s little reason to think these losses mean a loss come November. Most every hypothetical matchup shows Clinton trouncing Donald Trump in a general. And when Trump does perform competitively, as he did in a trio of swing state Quinnipiac polls that came out today, it may well be because the samples in those polls were unrepresentative in their whiteness \u2013 at least, that was the case today. They mislead because white people really do comprise an increasingly small proportion of the electorate. In 1992, they were 87% of voters. By 2012, that had dropped to 72%. In 2016, it will fall still further, to an estimated 69%. If you factor in how much better Clinton is performing with women, the portion of the white electorate disposed to voting against her is cut roughly in half. Much has been made of the fact that Clinton trounced Obama in West Virginia in 2008, but viewed another way, it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world. All election season, she\u2019s run as the Obama candidate, touting his legacy and promising to carry forward his policies \u2013 now, she\u2019s finally getting Obama numbers. In West Virginia, where the electorate is unusually hostile to the Obama administration\u2019s actions around clean power, which has decimated the state\u2019s coal industry, that\u2019s a hindrance. (Clinton arguably didn\u2019t help the situation any with recent remarks about how her clean-energy plan would put coal companies out of business.) But in much of the rest of the country, it\u2019s an asset. Sure, coal country doesn\u2019t love her. Sure, voters there don\u2019t believe she simply \u201cmisspoke\u201d when talking of her clean-energy plan. Sure, states with a 91% white electorate like West Virginia don\u2019t love her. She doesn\u2019t need them to.",
