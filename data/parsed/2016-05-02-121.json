  "body": "Long-time Labour supporter Emma Thompson is urging London voters to back the Women\u2019s Equality party in Thursday\u2019s elections. The Oscar-winning actor told the Guardian that while she still supports Jeremy Corbyn, she feels issues that are important to women, including equal pay, are sidelined from mainstream politics. \u201cI just got to the point where I thought, I\u2019m 57, I have voted Labour all my life, I have spent my life living and working in the capital, and I can safely say I have never known it worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI am just so disappointed in our political landscape and what we have done in the last 30 years: it is with great sadness that I say that.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t feel spoken to by Labour.\u201d   Related: Emma Thompson: I do not want to die before closing the pay gap | Letters    In a letter to the Guardian, she said her generation expected as they grew up to see women taking on an equal role in all walks of life, including politics, and looked forward to the transformation that would bring. \u201cTo be sure, there have been some good shifts but by and large, the dreams of my generation have not been realised and many of our hopes have been dashed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am backing the Women\u2019s Equality party because I really do not want to die before closing the pay gap, which stands, in our great and supposedly modern capital city, at 23%.\u201d She argued the inequality between men and women was at the root of other socioeconomic divisions in London; but tackling it got left off the agenda because it was not a \u201cglamorous\u201d issue. \u201cWhat I feel is that politics has these glamorous subjects that people want to go on about \u2013 including this fucking war on terror \u2013 and all of the things that make politicians feel important.\u201d Thompson, who won the Oscar for best actress for Howard\u2019s End, and another for her screenplay of Sense and Sensibility, in which she also starred, has long campaigned for human rights and other political causes. As well as giving the WEP her vote, she now plans to work with the party on issues including improving sex education. The mayoral contest in London has become increasingly bitter in its final weeks, with the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, alleging that Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan is a \u201cradical\u201d who has shared a platform with Muslim extremists.   Related: Women\u2019s Equality party leader Sophie Walker: \u2018It\u2019s complex, but not complicated\u2019    The WEP is fielding a candidate \u2013 Sophie Walker \u2013 in the mayoral race, but is also calling on voters from across the political spectrum to use their votes in the separate London assembly poll to show support for its agenda, including forcing faster progress towards equal pay, tackling domestic violence and providing better support for women with caring responsibilities. \u201cI am backing them because I have met and talked with them and a more committed, bright, inspiring bunch of women with fantastic ideas I have never found,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI am inspired by Jeremy Corbyn, but I feel like I need to do something new.\u201d The London assembly elections use a proportional voting system, and the WEP hopes that by winning the backing of voters who may have given their first vote to a different candidate, it can attract enough support from across the capital to secure a seat. But Thompson made clear she would be supporting the party in the mayoral race and where they are standing in the London wide list - part of the assembly\u2019s proportional element.   Related: Questions for the Women\u2019s Equality party | Letters    The WEP was founded by the broadcaster Sandi Toksvig and the journalist Catherine Mayer, out of frustration at the slow pace of progress in tackling some of the problems that prevent women playing a full role in Britain\u2019s economic and political life. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2016. An earlier version stated that Thompson would be using \u201call\u201d her votes on the WEP. The party is not contesting any of the assembly constituencies \u2013 only the London-wide list.",
