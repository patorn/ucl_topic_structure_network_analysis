A bingo card of things for them to spot. A selection of suitably continental snacks to crack open as soon as the appropriate nation appears on screen. And we are ready to field all the difficult geopolitical questions that a six-year-old can muster:   Related: Eurovision song contest: share your favourite memories    \u201cDaddy, why is Israel in Europe?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d \u201cDaddy, why is Australia in Europe?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s baffling.\u201d \u201cDaddy, if we vote Brexit will we have to leave Eurovision?\u201d \u201cJust shut up and watch the damn thing.\u201d If you don\u2019t have kids, you are almost guaranteed to have a better Eurovision party \u2026 and if you are in any doubt whether it will be a worthwhile night, here are our tips for things to look out for. WARNING: we know it\u2019s hardly Game of Thrones, but let\u2019s be clear, this article does contain spoilers. Forced deportation: Ukraine pulls no punches         Jamala\u2019s 1944 is strongly tipped to win on Saturday night    Jamala\u2019s 1944 features a light show that will be some of the finest staging of the night, plus a virtuoso vocal performance. It tells the story of the forced deportation of people from the Crimea by the Soviet Union in 1944. Once selected by Ukraine, the EBU had to give a ruling on whether the lyrics were political or not. They decided it was OK. It\u2019s one of the favourites, but will be up against a very strong effort from Russia. Insert your own non-political punchline here. Fancy some traditional Armenian instruments? We sometimes long for the days when the songs contained a bit more national character. If you put on the Spotify playlist, occasionally you forget you are listening to Eurovision entries and start wondering if you\u2019ve stumbled upon a cache of secret demos for the next Katy Perry album.      Not so with Armenia. They\u2019ve taken the \u201cbig soaring female vocals + over-the-top drumming\u201d formula that few countries have strayed from \u2013 then whacked a solo in the middle with loads of quarter-tones in it.

Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images    The Netherlands back the wrong country  Eurovision has broken through into the US, and the Netherlands have got a bit overexcited about it. Douwe Bob\u2019s Slow Down is a pleasant enough country track, sung in an accent that veers between both sides of the Atlantic. But they don\u2019t seem to have realised that Americans can\u2019t vote.   Related: How Eurovision finally cracked America    There\u2019s a huge twist in it by the way, described by Douwe\u2019s producer as \u201cthe cheapest trick in the history of Eurovision\u201d, and we wholeheartedly recommend it.     Douwe Bob is representing the Netherlands with \u2018the cheapest trick in the history of Eurovision\u2019. Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images    You get to cheer on the UK We automatically qualify for the final because ... [consults EBU rulebook] ... oh, money. Joe and Jake will be going 25th in the final \u2013 the penultimate song. We haven\u2019t finished above 19th place in the last four years. Surely they can do better? It\u2019s not blind nationalism about our musical skills \u2013 it would just be lovely to host the party again.         All our hopes of hosting next year are resting on Joe and Jake.    Of course, if they do win, it might spark an almighty scrap. There have already been arguments about whether Joe Woolford can use the Welsh flag in Stockholm, and if a UK duo comprising a Welshman and an Englishman won the contest, where would we host the 2017 final? Amir has been on a journey France also qualify for the final as one of the \u201cBig Five\u201d who join the hosts automatically. Amir will be singing J\u2019ai cherch\u00e9. Born in Paris to parents of Tunisian and Moroccan-Spanish heritage, he emigrated to Israel when he was a child. He has studied dentistry, and is deaf on one side. It\u2019s a unique route to Eurovision, and the song is a happy-clappy upbeat slice of pop.         The French song is one of the more upbeat numbers to make the final    Who knew Bulgaria had chipmunks? Bulgaria\u2019s entry incongruously features a brief audio appearance from what sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks in the background, singing a completely different song. It\u2019s bold, we\u2019ll give it that.         Poli Genova featuring Alvin and the Chipmunks on backing vocals    Georgia has indie on its mind Georgia\u2019s entry wander in like they\u2019ve just left the indie club next door. Their straight guitar approach is jarringly inconsistent with everyone else; it\u2019s possible they\u2019ve never seen Eurovision before. The song goes on to add an unwanted synthy breakdown in the middle, making them sound like a cross between Kula Shaker and EMF. Rather awkwardly, they\u2019ve called themselves Nika Kocharov and Young Georgian Lolitaz. Don\u2019t Google it.            They\u2019ve changed the voting system! This is 100% guaranteed to stop the awkward thing where a TV presenter spends 75 seconds over a badly-delayed satellite link telling the hosts for the 15th time what a wonderful show it has been and what a beautiful city Stockholm is. OK, it probably won\u2019t stop that, but it is the biggest change to the way the results are announced for years. We suspect the French will still insist on being the only jury to deliver their results in French though. Farewell, Graham Norton?     This is news to Graham Norton \u2026 Photograph: Christopher Baines/BBC/So TV/Christopher Baines/Matt Burlem    Alright, this is mostly wishful thinking. Not because we don\u2019t enjoy Graham \u2013 far from it, his sass has been quite excellent over the years. But you can\u2019t help feeling that part of Graham getting the gig was high-ups at the BBC wanting to keep the chatty-Irish-chappy-with-talk-show-pedigree thing going when Terry Wogan put the mic down.  If you\u2019ve watched the semi-finals, though, you\u2019ll know that Mel Giedroyc and Scott Mills have put in a performance over the two nights that strongly suggests they could handle the main event when the time comes for Graham to step aside.     Mel and Scott are coming for your job, Graham. Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/Guy Levy    The songs that didn\u2019t make the cut There are some people who argue religiously against watching the Eurovision semi-finals, because it ruins hearing the songs for the first time in the main show. This is nonsense, like refusing to watch the FA Cup Third Round because it detracts from the FA Cup Final. The semi-finals are just an excuse to have Eurovision three times in a week instead of once a year \u2013 and who can argue against there being more Eurovision? Most importantly, it is at the semi-final stage that you get to watch the entries that have somehow inexplicably made it through the national selection process despite being jaw-droppingly dreadful. Who can forget DJ BoBo\u2019s simply astonishing Vampires Are Alive from 2007?         DJ BoBo\u2019s vampiretastic 2007 entry was cruelly staked through the heart by Eurovision voters.    Macedonia\u2019s entry this year was a song called Dona by Kaliopi. Mel Giedroyc couldn\u2019t resist making the obvious kebab joke. And the first time you hear it, you genuinely expect the chorus to launch into Culture Club\u2019s Karma Chameleon.         We defy you to watch this and not burst into Karma Chameleon.     We were sorry to see Greece go. Not only does it rob us of the enjoyably predictable Cyprus-Greece vote swap, but it would also have given a strong political statement on stage.         Greece\u2019s entry won\u2019t feature in the Eurovision final this year.    The song Utopian Land featured lyrics about Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. However, with a choppy time signature echoing Greek folk music, and a large amount of the song rapped in Greek, the message didn\u2019t make it through to the final. As far as we are aware, Help You Fly, the Belarus entry by Ivan, was the first time anybody had attempted male nudity mixed with wolves in a Eurovision performance. For balance, the wolves were also naked. But Saturday\u2019s show is guaranteed to be family-friendly, because Belarus did not progress.     Naked Ivan. Naked wolf. No final for either of you.

Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/TASS    And the UK\u2019s favourite is \u2026 It\u2019s always a bit unpredictable who the UK will vote for. Brexiteers will probably tell you this is because masses of EU migrants are poised over the phone frantically dialling up to support the motherland. A more scientific look will suggest it is because our music jury can be at odds with the public. In 2014, Poland sent some implausibly busty farmhands to sing about Slavic Girls while kneading bread and churning milk, and the UK public duly voted them #1. The jury, meanwhile, judging purely on musical criteria, placed them last.         \u201cSo, UK public, what first attracted you to the cleavage-fixated video of \u2018Slavic Girls\u2019 by Donatan?\u201d    With any luck, we\u2019ll get half an hour of Norton moaning about eastern European countries always voting for their neighbours, then we\u2019ll give our 12 points to Australia. The bookmakers think it is Russia\u2019s to lose         Sergey Lazarev is a strong favourite for this year\u2019s Eurovision     Sergey Lazarev has been on the Russian pop scene since the early 2000s when he was part of pop duo \u0421\u041c\u042d\u0428!! (Smash!! in English), and has been a successful solo artist since 2005. He is widely expected to become Russia\u2019s second Eurovision triumph. Australia, France and Sweden\u2019s entries are also in the mix. However, Sergey\u2019s closest rival is a song with an anti-Soviet Union message from Ukraine. The way the voting unfolds could be even more based on political geography than usual.  The Eurovision song contest is on BBC One tonight at 8pm.",
