  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull has sought to allay fears about Donald Trump winning the US presidency by saying the Australia-US alliance would remain strong regardless of who was president although Australians may observe US elections with consternation at times.   Related: Australia can't out-Trump Trump on refugees, Q&A warned    On Thursday, speaking on Triple M, the Australian prime minister said there was truth in the proposition Trump had succeeded owing to a protest vote against traditional politicians. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of disappointment in middle America, with the very slow growth in middle incomes,\u201d he said. \u201cMiddle America has seen very slow growth and in some cases have gone backwards in incomes. \u201cIncome inequality is a big issue in the US \u2026 there are a lot of tensions there [and] support for Trump is clearly evidence of that.\u201d The possibility of a Trump presidency has caused widespread global consternation because he has advocated tariff increases against China, called the Geneva conventions a problem for the conduct of US wars, and has advocated the use of torture \u201ca hell of a lot worse\u201d than waterboarding and isolationism in the event of a war between North Korea and its neighbours, Japan and South Korea. Asked about that global concern Turnbull said: \u201cI have absolutely no doubt the Anzus alliance \u2013 the Australian-American relationship \u2013 will continue to grow and strengthen regardless of who the president is. \u201cOur relationship with the US is so deep, it\u2019s based on thousands if not millions of individual relationships, it\u2019s been built up over generations. \u201cPresidents and prime ministers can adjust it a bit but really it\u2019s a deep and strong relationship, and I have no doubt regardless of who the American people choose we will always have a very very strong friend and ally in Washington.\u201d The Triple M hosts asked, citing Trump\u2019s views on women and his immigration policies, whether \u201cfor all his lunacy, you know he isn\u2019t beholden to anyone\u201d and whether that was the source of his appeal. Turnbull replied \u201cauthenticity is always important\u201d and explained that Republicans generally won primaries by steering to the right and then attempt to win a general election by steering back to the centre. \u201cMaking that switch is always very challenging and I think that\u2019s the challenge Donald Trump will have if he is the Republican nominee.\u201d He said it looked as though Trump had the Republican nomination \u201cin the bag\u201d, after opponents Ted Cruz and John Kasich pulled out.

We observe it with admiration, sometimes, with consternation, at others. But it\u2019s the biggest exercise in democracy we see in the developed world.\u201d In a lecture in April the former Australian ambassador to the US Kim Beazley said a Trump presidency would cause substantial problems in relations with China and sink the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. \u201cWere he to come back halfway, it would still be devastating,\u201d Beazley said. \u201cThat\u2019s a serious matter, a matter of concern. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d necessarily be all that worried about it. He has no regard for alliances at all.\u201d",
