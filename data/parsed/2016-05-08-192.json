Here\u2019s a pro-Brexit cabinet minister who keeps stirring up futile controversy: over policy, to be sure, but also over his hapless private life. Now, only a few days hence, he\u2019s announcing his verdict on the future of a much-loved national institution \u2013 and making a rare hash of the present preliminaries. If you\u2019re David Cameron, do you (a) stick loyally by John Whittingdale as he blunders deeper into the media mire of BBC charter renewal or (b) sit back and think about an inevitable 24 June reshuffle? Is he a dead culture secretary walking \u2013 or, rather, talking too much? Whittingdale came under relentless fire last week as the latest trial balloon from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport crashed and burned. Shift Strictly Come Dancing, by exhortatory government decree, to some off-peak time so that it doesn\u2019t take audience ratings from The X Factor? Even the Daily Mail gagged over that. Lord Puttnam and his public service broadcasting inquiry took careful aim. \u201cWe have been continuously assured by the culture secretary that he wants the BBC to \u2018thrive in the years to come\u2019, but the drip, drip of these leaks suggest the opposite, that the government wants a significantly diminished corporation\u201d. Sir David Attenborough cuddled a baby lion and snarled at Whitehall ambitions. Chris Patten, former chair of the BBC Trust and the Tory party, delivered a broadside on behalf of \u201cbesieged\u201d former colleagues. All the usual Beeb-loving liberal suspects, you might say. Perhaps. But the interesting thing was how no one chirped up to defend old Whitto. He\u2019s the butt of quite good, widely repeated jokes by the chancellor. He\u2019s not a suitable case for supportive treatment. That\u2019s because confusion follows him every step of the charter way. \u201cI love the BBC. I\u2019ve not set out to destroy the BBC,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not the job of secretary of state to tell the BBC what programmes they should and should not be making,\u201d he adds. \u201cEditorial independence is paramount.\u201d But, then, it\u2019s an \u201cinteresting question\u201d whether the corporation should bid against ITV for Saturday night specials such as The Voice. \u201cThere are savings within the BBC that don\u2019t require them to slash news budgets or close a channel\u2026 news is not the first place they should look, in many ways it should be the last place.\u201d Some programming \u201cisn\u2019t meeting the needs of communities\u201d. And so on and so forth, a monologue featuring \u2013 in only the last few days \u2013 the notion of a five-year, mid-charter check on quality, the hinted return of top-slicing licence fees, plus that idea about shifting Strictly times (a riff on an earlier push to get the BBC evening news shifted from 10 so ITV had no direct competition). Oh! And he made a joke about the corporation \u201cdriving him insane\u201d so that it was \u201ctempting to abolish it\u201d. Stir in the toxic development of a new BBC unitary board substantially appointed by HMG and the brew bubbles menacingly. This is a corporation that can be cut on a Treasury whim, told what to show when by the DCMS \u2013 and have its collar felt when politically necessary. Impartiality over Brexit? \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the director general about this, and I\u2019ve written to the chairman of the trust.\u201d Whittingdale recruited the charter team who guide his hand. He\u2019ll have a dominant hand in choosing the new BBC board and perhaps the new Ofcom committee that will take over regulation. He can\u2019t resist chipping in with threats and promises. He likes to show who\u2019s in charge. But does anyone, seriously, want to him to do this gabby, intellectually chaotic job? The chap who\u2019s really in charge of Whittingdale \u2013 writing detailed memos, laying out most of these plans \u2013 is of course David Cameron. But is he really so heedless as to leave implementation to the chap Gary Lineker calls \u201cthe chump\u201d? Of course there are many things at Broadcasting House you can frown at. Excessive stress on retaining the licence fee: exceeding confusion over internal reorganisation: extreme unhappiness over cuts not properly thought through. But there\u2019ll be time to worry about all that once the charter cavalcade has left town. Things, in the meantime, have become so busybody-ridiculous that the first, fundamental question of BBC Trust abolition is twisting into life again. Do we really want to lose the trust \u2013 and its quality control responsibilities \u2013 to find it replaced by a tame board, compliant Ofcom subcommittee and the ghost of Whitto riding shotgun? Now there\u2019s something it would truly be tempting to abolish. Dump the chump.",
