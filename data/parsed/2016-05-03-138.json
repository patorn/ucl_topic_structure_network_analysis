  "body": "Only very beautiful women and, perhaps, motorcycle couriers can get away with leather trousers. Detective Saga Nor\u00e9n in The Bridge? Just about. Ronan Keating? Not so much. These thoughts occur as I\u2019m introduced to Eva Green at an apparently select members\u2019 club in the gothic revival St Pancras Renaissance hotel in London. She\u2019s wearing black boots, black leather trousers, tailored black singlet, has long, dyed-black hair and lots of black eye makeup. \u201cI am a vampire,\u201d she laughs, as we retire to a sofa in a darkened corner, \u201cand I never expose myself to the sun. I have very fine skin, you see.\u201d She daily applies suncream (factor 30 or 50) under her makeup.   Related: Eva Green interview: Playing evil    Green is drawn to the dark side in other ways. The 35-year-old French actor is in London to promote her role as gaunt, statuesque, demonically possessed, cheeks-sucked-in-so-much-it-must-hurt-after-a-hard-day\u2019s-shooting clairvoyant Vanessa Ives in Sky series Penny Dreadful. The drama is a gothic mashup of Dracula, Dorian Gray, Frankenstein, steampunk aesthetics, vampires, werewolves, diabolical possession and obsolete alienist psychiatry. When I reviewed the first episode in 2014, I found it as impossible to take seriously as Ronan Keating in leather strides, notwithstanding all the impressive acting talent on show, including Rory Kinnear, Simon Russell-Beale, Helen McCrory, Billie Piper and Green herself. But the Victorian-set drama, whose third series starts this week, has since garnered decent ratings and won awards, so what do I know?         Watch the trailer for Penny Dreadful, season three    One day, Green whispers to me confidingly in husky, French-tinged, but nearly over-articulated English, she was in her trailer in Ireland. She was getting ready to film a scene in which Ives becomes demonically possessed and speaks in voices. In preparation, she was listening to a recording of the voice of a young German woman called Annaliese Michel. You can hear Michel\u2019s ostensibly demonically possessed voice on YouTube, before she underwent Catholic exorcism rites in 1974. It is disturbing listening, and made all the more so thanks to hindsight: Michel died the following year, after which her parents and two priests were convicted of negligent homicide. \u201cAs I was listening to it,\u201d says Green, \u201cmy makeup artist came in, heard these noises and said: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m getting out.\u2019 And she ran off. I can understand why. It feels as if it\u2019s contagious.\u201d   Related: Compelling, seductive horror: have you been watching Penny Dreadful?    Is it contagious? Do she think it\u2019s psychically risky to play such a deranged character, particularly when channelling the voice of someone who endured exorcism? \u201cOn the contrary. It\u2019s fun for me to do, even if the results are scary. I make jokes and play with the crew before we approach\u201d \u2013 she growls comically \u2013 \u201cthe darkness. Then I go into character.\u201d This is the third year Green has spent living in Ireland for five and a half months playing Vanessa Ives. As she puts it, with a chuckle: \u201cIt\u2019s as if you sign away your life to the devil. You have no life outside, so the show better be good.\u201d Clearly, Green thinks Penny Dreadful is good; she revels in playing a character in psychic meltdown. In this new series, Ives undergoes counselling with an alienist psychotherapist, and later appears in a padded cell with tears streaming down her face, hissing ominously at her doctors: \u201cYou think you know evil?\u201d How does Vanessa wind up like that? \u201cShe feels as if she has been abandoned by God, she has lost her lover, her faith and her family and she feels cursed. We all have our demons, but Vanessa\u2019s demons are literal. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d And, for Green as an actor, that\u2019s the opportunity.

I would go to an asylum.\u201d This, no doubt, explains why method actors such as Christian Bale or Tom Hardy wouldn\u2019t do well to work on a programme like Penny Dreadful. But does she take Penny Dreadful\u2019s themes of possession, the supernatural, the diabolical seriously? \u201cI have done so much research on this, but take it seriously? It\u2019s more like an acting dissection.\u201d She takes a sip from her red drink. It should be someone\u2019s blood but disappointingly it turns out to be beetroot juice to strengthen her immune system (her dietary regimen is as demanding as her skincare routine). \u201cIt\u2019s like I don\u2019t have a corset any more when I\u2019m playing Vanessa, you know? People will think that it\u2019s terrible to have fun in a show like that. But I do.\u201d Green claims, nonetheless, to be \u201cvery spiritual\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in God, but I believe in something more. I believe there are things or energies beyond the everyday.\u201d Then she checks herself, worried how this is might come across. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I sound like a fucking weirdo. It\u2019s tricky to talk about these things.\u201d     Penny Dreadful season three. Photograph: Jonathan Hession/Showtime    Nothing in her background prepared her for this attitude to the supernatural. Her mother, Marl\u00e8ne Jobert, an actor turned children\u2019s writer, is of Sephardic Jewish ancestry; her dentist father, Walter, is part Swedish, part French. She describes herself as a secular Jew who never attended synagogue as a girl. Both Green\u2019s parents tried talking her out of accepting what proved to be a breakthrough role in her first film. After training in acting in London and New York, she returned to her native Paris, where she played in several stage productions, including Jealousy in Three Faxes, where she was noticed by the director Bernardo Bertolucci. He approached the then 21-year-old and asked her to make her screen debut in his new film The Dreamers (2003), a free adaptation of one-time Guardian columnist Gilbert Adair\u2019s novel about a threesome during les \u00e9v\u00e8nements in 1968 Paris. Why did her parents advise her against accepting? \u201cBecause of what happened to Maria Schneider in Last Tango in Paris.\u201d Schneider disappeared after the film became a success, subsequently checking into an Italian psychiatric hospital. Several years later, she resumed her career. Green ignored her parents\u2019 advice. Was Bertolucci a monster on set? \u201cNot at all. He gave us a lot of freedom and let us be. He didn\u2019t give much direction at all. We didn\u2019t rehearse \u2013 he trusts in the magic of the moment. It was innocent and fun and crazy.\u201d She overcame her compunctions about her parents seeing her naked in the film \u2013 so much so that she protested about the censor\u2019s prudish cuts to The Dreamers when it was released in the US. She said at the time: \u201cIt is quite paradoxical, because in America there is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet I think they are frightened by sex.\u201d The Dreamers served as calling card to Hollywood. Green was not just beautiful \u2013 Bertolucci described her as \u201cso beautiful, it\u2019s indecent\u201d \u2013 but she could also speak English well (thanks to studying at the American University in Paris, as well as youthful sojourns in London, Ireland and Ramsgate), so soon after she was cast in two anglophone blockbusters: Ridley Scott\u2019s crusade flick Kingdom of Heaven (2005), opposite Orlando Bloom; and then Casino Royale (2006), where she played Vesper Lynd opposite Daniel Craig, as he made his first foray into the retooled 007 franchise.

Photograph: Allstar/New Line Cinema/Sportsphoto    After 007, though, Green\u2019s career took an unexpected turn. She played the witch Serafina Pekkala in Chris Weitz\u2019s The Golden Compass, his adaptation of the first volume of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials trilogy of fantasy novels. Her career since might seem to have been dominated by such supernatural roles \u2013 she played a witch not only in the sanitised Pullman adaptation, but in Tim Burton\u2019s Dark Shadows (2012). And in the 2011 TV series Camelot, she was the Arthur\u2019s malevolent half-sister Morgan, a woman obsessed with witchcraft. And now she plays a gothic heroine with supernatural powers. Is she in danger of getting typecast? \u201cI will have to do more normal roles because I don\u2019t want to be put in a box marked \u2018weird witch\u2019. People around me say: You must stop doing dark roles.\u201d Which people? \u201cOh you know, friends, boyfriends. But there\u2019s something fascinating in darkness. You learn about yourself as well by going to these extremes as an actor. Perhaps,\u201d she says with a chuckle, \u201cI should see a shrink.\u201d Her family don\u2019t understand why she is so frequently drawn to the dark side. \u201cIf I listened to my mother\u2019s advice, I wouldn\u2019t do anything. I tell her the story and she\u2019s like: \u2018Oh God! Why are you doing that?\u2019 Why can\u2019t you play something normal?\u2019\u201d Green\u2019s twin sister, Joy, she says, finds it strange to watch Penny Dreadful. \u201cShe watches me speaking in tongues and having fits and she says: \u2018This is my twin sister?\u2019\u201d The sisters\u2019 lives are very different. \u201cShe\u2019s married to an Italian count, lives in Italy and is busy raising her two children. Looking after the vineyard. Nice life, huh?\u201d    I was not even allowed to express myself. I don\u2019t think von Trier likes collaboration.    Green had problems with Lars von Trier. The Danish director sought her out to play the female lead in his notorious film about bereavement, sex and madness, Anti-Christ (2009). \u201cI was such a big fan. I was obsessed. It was my dream to work with him ever since Breaking the Waves, which was so magical to me.\u201d But then they met. \u201cI was not even allowed to express myself. I don\u2019t think he likes collaboration.\u201d Was there a particular problem? \u201cWe didn\u2019t agree on some sexual shots. He took what I said really badly. So. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d Instead, Charlotte Gainsbourg took the role of a bereaved mother who castrates her husband (Willem Dafoe) and then mutilates her clitoris. Gainsbourg, rather than Green, won the best actress award at Cannes for her performance. Why has she acted so little in her native language? \u201cI want to, but I\u2019m worried. I feel like the French are waiting to trash me, so I have to find the right thing. I now have a French agent, but I haven\u2019t been approached by anybody.\u201d That\u2019s not quite true: she recently finished filming a French movie. \u201cIt was called I Don\u2019t Care About That One,\u201d she jokes guardedly. \u201cIt was not good.\u201d She yearns for better French roles and has written to one of her favourite French directors, Jacques Audiard, imploring him to consider her. \u201cIt would be a holiday. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the English. Your voice and your whole identity changes when you speak in a different language. So to speak French would reveal another me. The real me.\u201d     Eva Green in Tim Burton\u2019s new film Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children. Photograph: Fox    But who is the real Eva Green? In some senses, she\u2019s Charlotte Rampling or Kristin Scott Thomas in reverse \u2013 an actor who has cut it on the other side of the Channel. \u201cI love English. I have a flat here. I lived here when I was 23 or 24, so it\u2019s the grown-up me. I even dream in English.\u201d We will next see Green in another English-language fantasy film. In Tim Burton\u2019s new film Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children, adapted from American author Ransom Riggs\u2019s bestselling children\u2019s novel, she plays the eponymous orphanage director, living on a Welsh island, looking after kids whose special gifts are unrecognised in a boring, straight society. One child can bring animals and children back to life for a short time; another stores bees in his stomach to protect them; another is lighter than air and has to be tied down with a rope. We\u2019re back in Green land, a comfortingly familiar, if fantastical realm. One reason Green thinks she survives in such a tough profession is because it allows her to be the opposite of what she is in real life (she lives alone just outside Paris). \u201cI\u2019m quiet \u2013 boring even \u2013 in real life. Nothing like the mad witches I play. And I\u2019m still getting fun from it, the sort of fun a child gets from doing something they love and that is a little bit naughty.\u201d \u2022 Penny Dreadful is on Now TV and Sky Atlantic from 3 May at 10pm",
