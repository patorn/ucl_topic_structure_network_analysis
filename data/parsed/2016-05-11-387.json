  "body": "The publisher of a US magazine aimed at 8- to 12-year-old girls has apologised for offering tips on choosing bathing suits based on size and curves. Tween girls who are \u201ccurvy up top\u201d were advised in the latest issue of Discovery Girls that \u201ccoverage is key\u201d and they should opt for a one-piece with side cutouts or ties to \u201cdraw the eyes down\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re straight up and down,\u201d the article went on, girls were advised to \u201cadd curves with asymmetrical straps\u201d. Big block patterns were offered for those \u201crounder in the middle\u201d \u2013 all under the headline: \u201cWhat swimsuit best suits you?\u201d    Hey @DiscoveryGirls, why not include diet tips/surgical options with this? Your readers are 9, after all. Tick tock. pic.twitter.com/5oJI4KqnM6\u2014 Taffy Akner (@taffyakner) May 10, 2016    After taking heat on Twitter and other social media, founder and publisher Catherine Lee issued a lengthy apology on the Discovery Girls Facebook page expressing shock that the article was published. \u201cI am in total agreement with all of you regarding this article, so much so that I wanted to make this letter as public as possible,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe want to make sure that our girls know that any article that makes you feel bad about your body is not a good article, and should be questioned.\u201d Lee said it was \u201cstill hard for me to believe that an article so contrary to our magazine\u2019s mission could have been published on our pages. I have been a loss for words for days.\u201d   Related: The \u2018perfect body\u2019 is a lie. I believed it for a long time and let it shrink my life    She did not give further details about the commissioning and publishing of the article, but said it was supposed to be \u201cabout finding cute, fun swimsuits that make girls feel confident, but instead it focused on girls\u2019 body image and had a negative impact\u201d. Lee added: \u201cNobody knows better than Discovery Girls how impressionable our girls are at this age and we are ALWAYS mindful of this.\u201d She said the magazine was \u201cnot immune to making mistakes, but we are always willing to get better and learn from our mistakes\u201d. But responses to Lee\u2019s apology \u2013 some from parents of girls in the magazine\u2019s target age group \u2013 queried why the article had been published at all. \u201cI don\u2019t want your magazine telling my nine-year-old that she needs to feel \u2018confident\u2019 in her swimsuit. She has no current thoughts about NOT feeling confident in her swimsuit,\u201d wrote one subscriber. Associated Press contributed to this report",
