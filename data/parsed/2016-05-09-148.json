  "body": "All over the country graveyards are filling up, and in London \u201cthe situation is critical\u201d. No surprise there, then. There\u2019s hardly any space left in town for living people, never mind dead ones, and by 2020 eight boroughs will have completely run out of space. So the City of London cemetery has started to reuse graves. Only graves at least 75 years old \u2013 and warning posters will be attached to give relatives and chums a chance to object. If they do, it won\u2019t happen.   Related: Re-using graves means UK cemetery will never run out of space    Sounds fair enough to me. It\u2019s not the only cemetery trying to solve a space problem \u2013 Israel\u2019s Yarkon cemetery is vertical and multi-tiered; there are two storeys of tombs in part of the Punta Arenas cemetery, Chile; and there are layers of bodies at Prague\u2019s Jewish cemetery and in vaults, crypts and mausoleums at Wadi Al-Salaam, Iraq. But in the UK you can only reuse graves in London. Lucky for Fielding, who fancies burial because he just doesn\u2019t like the idea of ripping great flames, in case it was all a mistake and he wakes up. Hopefully we\u2019ll know nothing about it, so we don\u2019t mind grave-sharing. It\u2019s the people left behind who will have to decide. Bad luck. My parents are sprinkled under a rosebush on a hill above Hove, next to my auntie, with a bit of my mother also on her favourite beach. I wouldn\u2019t mind being scattered, along with the dogs, on their favourite walkie routes \u2013 which I suspect is illegal, but why? That\u2019s the only sort of reincarnation that works for me. Then more charming grasses and plants will grow from the ashes, the birds and bees will pass them along, and on it all goes. Not that I enjoy considering death, but this is a column about age; my friends and contemporaries are dropping like flies, or teetering on the edge. Graveyards are news, and my lovely old boxer just died, which feels worse than I expected \u2013 although I ought to be used to it after six dogs. But the tortoise is still here. I talk to it more than usual.",
