  "body": "Last November, Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke opined on the problems facing modern protest songwriters: \u201cIf I was going to write a song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms \u2026 it\u2019s much harder to do that now.\u201d Harder, perhaps, but not impossible. A week or so after Yorke made his remarks, Anohni teased her new track 4 Degrees, a combination of cutting-edge electronica and orchestral grandeur that didn\u2019t so much address climate change as dive headfirst into its fiery pits: \u201cI want to hear the dogs crying for water,\u201d she sang. \u201cI want to see the fish go belly-up in the sea / And all those lemurs and all those tiny creatures / I want to see them burn.\u201d    Related: Anohni, the artist once known as Antony Hegarty, on life beyond the Johnsons    It wasn\u2019t the first time she had sung about the environmental destruction taking place around us. In 2008, recording under the name Antony and the Johnsons, she had released the resigned Another World (\u201cI need another world, this one\u2019s nearly gone.\u201d). 4 Degrees, though, is a far cry from that, and the very definition of John Lydon\u2019s assertion that anger is an energy. Anohni seems desperate to shock us into action by revelling in the agony climate change is set to bring upon us: \u201cAnd all those rhinos and and all those big mammals / I want to see them laying crying in the fields.\u201d          Listen to Anohni\u2019s 4 Degrees    It would be wrong, however, to say that Hopelessness is an album solely about climate change. The issues being raised here are multiple, making it exactly the kind of protest record Thom Yorke would say cannot exist in the modern age. It\u2019s direct. It\u2019s angry. It seeks change. Execution despairs at America\u2019s obsession with the death penalty (\u201cExecution, it\u2019s the American Dream!\u201d) while Obama, Drone Bomb Me and Violent Men don\u2019t exactly need a degree in advanced metaphor to interpret. Watch Me might seem charged with sexual frisson at first \u2013 \u201cDaddy, Daddy \u2026 watch me watching pornography\u201d \u2013 but you swiftly realise it\u2019s about the era of global surveillance, and the sarcasm drips thick: \u201cProtecting me from evil / Protecting me from terrorism / Protecting me from child molesters.\u201d  You\u2019d imagine such explicitness could make Hopelessness rather unfashionable, yet that\u2019s never the case. Perhaps this is because Anohni, who previously preferred to record against soft piano with the occasional instrumental flourish, has changed tack for Hopelessness, teaming up with the avant-electronica producers Hudson Mohawke and Oneohtrix Point Never. The results are astonishing, treading a line between underground electronica and the most cutting-edge pop and R&B productions: fizzing synths, beats that skitter along or thud like heartbeats. I Don\u2019t Love You Anymore \u2013 with its organs and gunshot cracks \u2013 sounds like a church service during the breakout of apocalypse.  Perhaps surprisingly, Anohni\u2019s voice fits seamlessly into such modern arrangements: she\u2019s strong enough to compete with their occasional bombast, while the producers frequently show restraint to let the soulful inflections that marked out her best balladery shine through. This combination is most notable on Crisis, the album\u2019s highpoint, and an apology to the world for the torture of Guant\u00e1namo inmates. \u201cIf I tortured your brother / In Guant\u00e1namo / I\u2019m sorry\u201d, she sings, possibly not with an eye on the Billboard Hot 200. As the track threatens to peter out, she lets out another, almost choked \u201csorry\u201d, followed by a resigned puff of breath. It sounds like she might just break down. Instead, the track blossoms into euphoric synths and Anohni lets her lungs loose to rampage through the octaves. It\u2019s tempting, through the emotional rush of Crisis, to think what Yorke might make of such a musical statement \u2013 as profound a protest record as anyone has made in decades, brimming with anger, and yet, somehow, oddly accessible. Perhaps that\u2019s the most peculiar thing about Hopelessness: when Anohni sings about mass graves and drone strikes, it doesn\u2019t feel like a lecture. It can be strangely empowering. For all its bleakness, Hopelessness leaves you feeling anything but.",
