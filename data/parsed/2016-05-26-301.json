Well, it is quite true. I sat there in the festival\u2019s Palais, and cried. But I frankly defy anyone who sees this film not to cry at the key moment, which takes place in a food bank.   Related: Ken Loach stuns at Cannes 2016 with Palme d'Or win for I, Daniel Blake    I have written many times about crying in the cinema, and for some critics there is almost a kind of reverse machismo in admitting, or boasting, that you are prone to tears in the auditorium. But this tends to be about obviously lachrymose things such as Dumbo visiting his mum in that \u201cmad elephant\u201d prison-cart. The tears in I, Daniel Blake are different. They are tears of identification and shame, and indeed anger. You can identify with the shabby-genteel customers in the food bank and their suppressed mortification and even horror that things have somehow come to this. When the movie opens in Britain, I predict more tears.     Teddie-Rose Malleson-Allen, far left, plays Tatty in a new BBC adaptation of Swallows and Amazons. Photograph: MCPIX/REX/Shutterstock    Titty for Tatty  The name-change row rages on over a new BBC adaptation of Arthur Ransome\u2019s Swallows and Amazons. The character Titty has been discreetly altered to Tatty, to the fury of the family of Titty Altounyan, the woman who inspired this fictional figure. It is as if to say \u2013 look, those olden-days fuddy-duddies didn\u2019t realise that \u201ctitty\u201d just means breast, and we in the trendy modern world don\u2019t want to be laughed at, or accused of inappropriate language. Perhaps it won\u2019t be long before nature programmes talk about the blue tat, the willow tat, the great tat, the yellow-bellied tat, or indeed the tufted tatmouse. It\u2019s ridiculous, but I sort of sympathise. When I was very young I couldn\u2019t believe there was a storybook character actually called Winnie the \u2026 and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say it.\u00a0\u201cYou mean like going to the lavatory?\u201d I asked my mum in outraged astonishment. She dismissed my squeamish objections as absurd, although I could never participate in a game of pooh-sticks with an easy mind.     Douglas Adams: \u2018a prophetic genius\u2019. Photograph: Nigel Robertson/BBC    Lost in translation The prophetic genius of Douglas Adams is a subject that never gets old. This week his admirers have cause to raise it once again. I am one of those people who never goes abroad without that most old-fashioned and uncool of things: a phrasebook, that non-fiction genre steeped in the language of complaint,\u00a0encouraging the reader to demand the whereabouts of the nearest British embassy. But it could be that the phrasebook is now obsolete. There is a new wireless device preparing for launch this year, the Pilot, which translates languages directly into your ear. The gadget\u2019s earpiece \u201chears\u201d the language and translates it: it can do French, Spanish, Italian and English, with other languages planned including Japanese and Chinese. The only drawback is that you reply in your own language so the person speaking has to have an earpiece too. But how about what it\u2019s called? The\u00a0\u201cPilot\u201d? Oh, no. Adams fans know\u00a0that it should be called the Babel fish, after the creature you put in your ear that instantly translates everything. But be warned. As Adams says: \u201cThe poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communications between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.\u201d",
