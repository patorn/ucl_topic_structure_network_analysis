  "body": "Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin has been called many things throughout his career: a bedwetter, a geography teacher, a \u201cwoeful fucking waste of a snail\u2019s time\u201d ... but a comedic maverick? Never. Until now, that is.  The Devonshire frontman has long been a supporter of comedy. A close friend of Simon Pegg and Ricky Gervais, he is a musician who understands that, when it comes to mocking the famous for their ludicrous lifestyle, if you can\u2019t beat them, join them. Most recently, Martin provided a skit for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, in which he offers to create lyrics for the US talkshow\u2019s theme tune.            The skit follows a similar theme to most of Martin\u2019s comedy appearances \u2013 parodies in which his perceived seriousness is the butt of the joke, sometimes to brilliant effect. In some cases the very earnest act of impregnating Gwyneth Paltrow with a baby named Apple is even up for roasting.  So here\u2019s a brief chronology of Chris Martin\u2019s comedy career.  Shaun of the Dead \u2013 2004 As with Bob Geldof and Bono, the British find nothing funnier than an artist\u2019s earnest philanthropic pursuits. The earliest example of Martin parodying his charitable nature \u2013 and perhaps the moment in which his dalliance with comedy began \u2013 came alongside Simon Pegg and Nick Frost during one of zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead\u2019s more meta moments. Representing the charity Zombaid, Chris Martin \u2013 who also appeared as a zombie in the film \u2013 and Johnny Buckland sit beside Vernon Kay on the T4 sofa to preach about their new charity venture set up following the zombie possession of their drummer and bassist. A beautifully understated performance from the heir to Steve Martin\u2019s comedic throne.  Score:  5/10            Extras \u2013 2006 As previously mentioned, Chris Martin\u2019s comedy cameos often involve the merciless ribbing of his many charity-based endeavours. In Extras, Ricky Gervais\u2019s character Andy makes a charity promo video while scrabbling for credibility and industry praise. Martin appears as a ruthless self-promoter, his sole intention to advertise the band\u2019s Greatest Hits album. \u201cCan we get on with this?\u201d he says ahead of the video\u2019s first take. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do Aids and Alzheimer\u2019s and landmines this afternoon and I wanna get back for Deal Or No Deal. Plus Gwyneth\u2019s making drumsticks.\u201d It\u2019s funny, but a lingering sense of smugness resides. Score: 6/10            Br\u00fcno \u2013 2009 Enlisting music industry heavyweights to promote his 2009 film, Br\u00fcno, Sacha Baron Cohen created a spoof charity single entitled Dove of Peace, with the Coldplay singer appearing alongside Sting, Bono, Slash and Snoop Dogg. A source told the Mirror newspaper at the time: \u201cChris Martin was in stitches throughout the recording and only just managed to get his lines out.\u201d Maybe you had to be there.  Score: 4/10            The Simpsons \u2013 2010 During episode Million Dollar Maybe, Homer wins $1m in the lottery. Having missed a wedding reception in order to buy the winning ticket, Homer uses his prize money to buy back the love of his nearest and dearest with anonymous gifts; hiring the band to play a concert for Bart, who lives out every music fan\u2019s fantasy and pauses the show to nip to the bogs. While a Simpsons cameo is the cornerstone of an artist\u2019s fame, an animated Martin loses some of his puppyish appeal. If you\u2019re still in any doubt of Martin\u2019s innate humour, watch the video below, as he manages to make the whole Simpsons writing room laugh.  Score: 5/10        Saturday Night Live \u2013 2013 Often a musician\u2019s part on a SNL skit can seem a little PR-motivated; an attempt to soften the sometimes inaccessible and earnest stars of the celebrity world. Martin appears as Jan Pockabook, alongside Fred Armisen and Kirstin Wiig (in character as Garth and Kat), who share some of their new festive Thanksgiving music. Martin might have been upstaged by the two comic\u2019s performances, but it was an admirable step away from his sincere, charity-pushing repertoire. Score: 8/10            Comic Relief\u2019s Game of Thrones Opera \u2013 2015 Arriving at a point in which Chris Martin\u2019s lovelife was the subject of much media attention - his divorce, an album full of songs about the divorce, the subsequent paparazzi shots of Martin and a string of young Hollywood A-listers \u2013 his Red Nose Day video managed to momentarily extinguish some of the heat surrounding his private life. Entitled Game of Thrones: The Musical, it\u2019s the greatest rock opera of all time (at least in the eyes of its creator), featuring Coldplay\u2019s \u201cfirst romantic song about incest\u201d and a reggae track entitled Rastafarian Targaryen.  Score: 10/10",
