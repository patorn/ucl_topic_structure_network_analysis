Related: Tinder launches group dating feature \u2013 and exposes you to Facebook friends    Tinder, owned by global dating firm Match Group, is alleging trademark infringement in the high court against 3nder, an independent app for non-monogamous couples and their potential partners. It wants its smaller competitor to shut down and erase its presence from the web entirely to avoid \u201cconfusion\u201d between the two apps, claiming the alleged similarity gives 3nder an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d. But 3nder launched its fightback in bizarre fashion on Monday, calling on its users to send Tinder pictures of their socks via Twitter, using the hashtag #TinderSuckMySocks. Founder Dimo Trifonov vowed to fight Tinder, which he accused of \u201cloading a nuclear weapon\u201d against his firm, which employs just eight people. The campaign has already gained some support online from fans of 3nder posting their own sock-based photographs and anti-Tinder sentiment. Twitter user @payah posted a picture of her own sock-clad feet in response to 3nder\u2019s call to arms.    #TinderSuckMySocks on @TreehouseLDN terrace..

Tinder\u2019s lawyers pointed to an interview with the New York Post in which they allege that Trifonov confirms this pronunciation. They added that the use of the name for an online dating app was \u201clikely to bring our client\u2019s Tinder mark to mind\u201d. The letter demands that 3nder respond by shutting down its website and remove all references to its name, including by third party sources. But Trifonov said his app\u2019s name was pronounced differently in many countries and questioned Tinder\u2019s ability to copyright an existing word or combination of letters. He added that Tinder itself was preceded by gay dating app Grindr, whose name is only a few letters different.  \u201cThe whole thing is unfair ... can I trademark the word coffee and then sue every coffee shop in the world?\u201d he said. \u201cWho does that? Evil corporations do that.\u201d The web designer, who developed the app after his girlfriend wrote him a love letter about a French woman, said Tinder\u2019s legal assault could force him to lay off his eight-strong team. The threat comes after a period of rapid growth: the number of would-be troilists using 3nder grew by 30% in 2015, sending its revenues soaring by 980%. A launch on the Android operating system is now being planned, allowing it to expand its reach far beyond its current stable of Apple users, because many more people around the world own Android phones. The growth plan is a turnaround from last year when the company flirted with bankruptcy before securing a $500,000 investment. In its call to its users to send pictures of their socks to Tinder, 3nder said: \u201cWhen a multi-billion corporation is after you, you don\u2019t have many options but to fight back hard or just let them destroy you. On the outside Tinder is cute and friendly but if you look below the surface you will see it is one piece of a gigantic corporation hungry for more.\u201d A spokesperson for Tinder did not respond to requests for comment.",
