  "body": "The Pensions Regulator has admitted that it only found about the controversial sale of BHS by Sir Philip Green after reading about it in the newspapers. The revelation raises further questions about the nature of the sale to Dominic Chappell, who has been bankrupt three times, and the powers of the regulator. Lesley Titcomb, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, told MPs that the body had concerns about BHS since 2012, but an \u201canti-avoidance\u201d investigation into the funding of its pension scheme was only launched after the sale to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions in March 2015. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at up to \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership and Retail Acquisitions receiving payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS over the last 13 months. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Titcomb said that if the Pensions Regulator had been told of the sale it would have taken steps to ensure provisions had been taken for the pension scheme. She said the \u201canti-avoidance\u201d investigation \u2013 which could force Green to contribute towards the deficit \u2013 should make significant progress by the end of the year. However, the regulator was criticised by MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and work and pensions committee, who are holding a joint investigation into the demise of BHS. Richard Fuller, the Conservative MP for Bedford and Kempston, said: \u201cFor good reasons or bad, you don\u2019t sound like much of a regulator.\u201d Titcomb said the body became concerned about BHS in 2012 after a 23-year recovery plan for the pension scheme was agreed between trustees and Arcadia, Green\u2019s retail group. She said the length of the recovery plan was \u201cvery atypical\u201d but that BHS \u201cdid not meet the threshold\u201d for a proactive investigation to be launched. Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the Pension Protection Fund, which is set to take on the BHS pension scheme, said the recovery plan was scheduled for more than twice the average of nine years and \u201crather ambitious\u201d. He called on MPs to consider introducing a natural limit to recovery plans. Rubenstein also revealed that in 2012 Arcadia withdrew a guarantee it had put in place on the BHS pensions scheme after being told it was not as valuable as the company claimed. The BHS pension deficit was guaranteed by the assets of Davenbush, a company within Arcadia holding property, which allowed Arcadia to pay a smaller levy towards the PPF. However, Rubenstein said: \u201cIt [the guarantee] wasn\u2019t worthless, but it could not have withstood a claim for \u00a3200m [the deficit at the time].\u201d The PPF boss said the pensions system had been abused by companies looking to use guarantees to lower their PPF payments. The rules have subsequently been changed so that trustees must independently value the assets behind a guarantee.     Sir Philip Green sold BHS for \u00a31. Photograph: Ian West/PA    The PPF faces an initial hit of about \u00a3275m for taking on the BHS pension scheme. However, Rubenstein insisted the organisation could afford to take on BHS, and potentially the \u00a315bn pension scheme behind Tata Steel UK. He said they would not \u201cundermine our long-term viability\u201d. The PPF is funded by a levy paid by defined pension schemes across the UK. Companies usually agree to pay the levy on behalf of the pension scheme. In the UK, five out of six defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit. The total deficit is \u00a3300bn. A string of investigations have been launched into the collapse of BHS. On top of the inquiries by MPs, the Insolvency Service is examining BHS and the Serious Fraud Office is considering whether there are grounds to launch a formal investigation. Green is due to give evidence to MPs in June, while Chappell has also said he is willing to appear. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, has called in two of Green\u2019s bitterest former rivals to assist the parliamentary investigation into the collapse of BHS. Sir David Norgrove, who as chairman of Marks & Spencer\u2019s pension fund was instrumental in scuppering Green\u2019s attempted bid for the retailer in 2004, has been appointed special adviser. Paul Myners, who also fought off Green\u2019s bid as chairman of M&S between 2004 and 2006 when the former BHS owner attempted a \u00a310bn takeover, has been appointed to lead a panel of financial assessors for the committee. Lord Myners has already filed 11 questions in the House of Lords calling on the government to investigate the demise of BHS. The appointments are likely to further ratchet up the dispute between Field and Green, which kicked off last week when the MP suggested the former BHS owner should be stripped of his knighthood if he did not put up funds to pay off the retailer\u2019s pension fund deficit.  Green then called for Field\u2019s resignation, suggesting the MP was prejudiced against him. The tycoon added: \u201cClearly he has made his decision as to what he feels the punishment should be without even hearing any evidence from anybody about BHS or the circumstances of the last 15 years.\u201d",
