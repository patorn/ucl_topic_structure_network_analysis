The former mayor of London, who had presented the politics programme with David Mellor for the past eight years, denied that his comments had led to the radio station\u2019s decision not to renew his contract this year. Livingstone told the Guardian that LBC informed him in early April he could not present the two-hour Saturday morning show during the EU referendum campaign because of Ofcom impartiality rules.  He said he had given station management two letters from Ofcom stating that he did not represent Labour.            Ken Livingstone defends Hitler comments \u2013 video    Livingstone has appeared on LBC\u2019s Saturday show as a guest in the wake of the antisemitism row, but has not been on the station since then. \u201cI was told on Monday that my contract would not be renewed,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cIt was an annual contract and doesn\u2019t run out until the end of July/early August. I\u2019ve been on every Saturday since September 2008 except for when I\u2019ve been on holiday \u2026 and a break ahead of the 2012 mayoral election.\u201d An LBC spokesman said Livingstone would not return to his presenting role. The Saturday show had about 300,000 listeners, compared with about 50,000 when he took over the 10am-midday timeslot, Livingstone said, and was running \u201cneck-and-neck\u201d with Radio 4.  It had also been well supported by advertisers, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising that a capitalist company is doing this. David [Mellor] isn\u2019t happy either,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would stop me on the street and say how much they liked the show.\u201d  Livingstone questioned whether the Tories may have leaned on LBC bosses to take him off the show. The controversy arose when Livingstone said in a BBC London interview last month that Hitler had supported Zionism \u201cbefore he went mad and ended up killing 6 million Jews\u201d, and also claimed there was a \u201cwell-orchestrated campaign by the Israel lobby to smear anybody who criticises Israeli policy as antisemitic\u201d. Livingstone maintained his stance on Saturday. \u201cNo paper or media organisation has shown that what I said was wrong,\u201d he said. Labour suspended Livingstone in late April for \u201cbringing the party into disrepute\u201d, and Jeremy Corbyn said the party was \u201cnot tolerating antisemitism in any form whatsoever\u201d. Livingstone said Labour\u2019s Blairite wing had used the controversy as an opportunity to remove him from the national executive committee, the party\u2019s ruling body.  He gave up his place on the committee this month, losing his most influential role in the party.   This article was amended on 30 May 2016 to correct the claim that David Mellor\u2019s contract was not being renewed by LBC.",
