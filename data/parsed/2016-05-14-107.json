  "body": "The Daily Express owner Richard Desmond is to build a secondary school as part of a 1m sq ft redevelopment of his old Westferry printworks site in London\u2019s upmarket Docklands area.  The school, which could become an academy, will sit among a mixed commercial and residential development comprising nine towers of up to 30 floors, containing 722 homes, retail and office space, cafes, restaurants and public open spaces. Boris Johnson approved the development in one of his last acts as London mayor, after seizing control of planning authority from Tower Hamlets council. Building the school is a condition of the planning permission. There is a chance the new school could be become an academy. If it does, according to the Times, it is understood that the media billionaire, who once owned niche interest adult magazines, wants to call it the Richard Desmond academy. Market experts have said that Desmond stands to make a fortune off the development, which could be worth as much as \u00a3750m when it is completed. He already owns the freehold on the site \u2013 for which he is estimated to have spent about \u00a330m \u2013 and construction costs are expected to be between \u00a3250m and \u00a3300m.    Related: Richard Desmond's firm in \u00a325m loss after price cuts and digital investment    Johnson seized control of planning authority for the site in February and was granted permission in April. It was initially rejected by Tower Hamlets for failing to include enough affordable housing and would not achieve a mixed and balanced community. Just 11% of the housing proposed, which is close to the Canary Wharf financial district, is classed as affordable. The mayor told the council that he was calling in the application because it had \u201cfallen short of its housing delivery target\u201d and \u201cthe council has identified an established need for additional secondary school places in the borough\u201d. Despite that, Tower Hamlets has maintained its opposition to the scheme, publishing a report in early April, before permission was granted, saying it had resolved to reject the application if it could. According to promotional literature, over 1 hectare of the site has been provided for a new secondary school of two to four storeys, providing 1,200 pupil places. It obliquely addresses the rumour that Desmond would want to run the school as an academy. \u201cAny decisions regarding the proposed operators of the school will be for the London borough of Tower Hamlets and the Department of Education to resolve, and are beyond the remit of a planning application,\u201d it says. Among the development\u2019s most determined opponents have been local sailing enthusiasts, who say the new highrises will ruin wind conditions around their club, which is adjacent to the development site.  Benjamin Davis, water operations manager the Docklands Sailing and Watersports Centre, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to reduce the wind that we receive, and it\u2019s going to distort is as well. We are supportive of development happening there, but this is the end of a two-year planning process that they have gone through, and throughout that they haven\u2019t considered any alternatives.\u201d DP9, Desmond\u2019s planning adviser, which originally asked Johnson to take control of the planning process, has negotiated a mitigation package of \u00a3546,000 for the club. But Davis said he was still disappointed with the outcome. \u201cThey need to fund a mitigation package, without regard for the fact that you can\u2019t buy wind,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo we have got to adapt our operation. It\u2019s really difficult for us.\u201d Davis\u2019s biggest fear was that the change in wind conditions would put customers off coming to the club, which operates as a charity and provides subsidised sailing courses for disadvantaged young people. \u201cWe are not funded by anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find our own funds and if people don\u2019t come down for sailing we don\u2019t make any money through that, which means we can\u2019t provide the youth activities we do in the summer. It\u2019s disappointing but there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything we can do.\u201d",
