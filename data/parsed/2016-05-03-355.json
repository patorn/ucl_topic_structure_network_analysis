Lining two walls of a dark, cube-like space within the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra is a congregation of clocks of different shapes and sizes, ticking, chiming and cuckoo-ing relentlessly. Each has been painted with ominous images and phrases that read like a lament to passing time, and time past. The clocks \u2013 and their echoing noise \u2013 add tension and conceptual depth to a room that\u2019s already brimming with both.   Related: 56th Venice Biennale review \u2013 more of a glum trudge than an exhilarating adventure    Painstakingly reproduced from her showing at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Fiona Hall\u2019s Wrong Way Time comprises about 800 objects which have been brought back to Australia from Italy. Each piece is tied together by the theme of time: its inexorable but cyclic march, the lessons we have learned over time (and those we haven\u2019t) and the histories that repeat whether we want them to or not.  As a display mechanism, the Adelaide-based artist has drawn from the concept of the wunderkammer \u2013 cabinets of curiosities which originated in Renaissance Europe as a way of cataloguing the world (or communicating one version of it). Glass cabinets form an inside square in the room, filled with evidence of Hall\u2019s multi-varied craftsmanship: sculptures, weave-work, paintings and various collections of readymade objects which she has tinkered with in other ways. Viewers bend over \u2013 eyes to the glass \u2013 as they crouch their way slowly from one cabinet to the next. The atmosphere is sombre, mystical and immediately compelling.   Related: 2016 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art: colour, wonder, materialism and magic       Fiona Hall\u2019s Wrong Way Time was the first exhibition held at the new permanent Australian pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale. It has been painstakingly recreated for a homecoming show at Canberra\u2019s National Gallery of Australia. Photograph: Christian Corte    As the unifying theme of this year\u2019s Adelaide Biennial, the wunderkammer seems to be enjoying a local revival, but Hall tells Guardian Australia she has been using the concept since at least the mid-90s. She calls herself a \u201cmuseum junkie\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not talking here about art galleries or art museums,\u201d she says, \u201cbut other kinds of museums: museums of natural history that were set up two or three centuries ago ... where objects from the world outside the confines of the museum were isolated from their original context, chosen not just for their informational value but also just because they were beautiful, or strange or quirky.     Fleet (2012) by Fiona Hall, carved from a single aluminum sardine tin. Photograph: Clayton Glen    \u201c[The wunderkammer] puts a particular kind of spin on our relationship with the world and how we decipher it, and how we choose to categorise it and then display it.\u201d Some pieces in Wrong Way Time are overtly political, dealing with international relations, capitalism and the environment; others are left open to analysis, but lift the mood with witty words and wryness. In one cabinet, shredded dollar bills are hand-woven into exquisite birds\u2019 nests, replicated from different species which are now extinct thanks to the ravages of capitalism (Tender). In another sits a collection of small glass perfume bottles on which are painted skulls to represent disappeared Tamils in Sri Lanka (Vaporised). In a third, endangered marine species have been hand-carved out of single sardine tins (in the style of her controversial 1996 work Paradisus Terrestis), each painted with maritime signal flags (Fleet). At the centre of the exhibition is All the King\u2019s Men: 20 bleak, spirit-like forms that seem to float. Step closer and they represent warriors or foot soldiers, their heads comprising shredded camouflage fabric taken from various armies, knitted together with a meticulous workmanship common to Hall\u2019s work.  Sewn into the masks and the \u201cbodies\u201d \u2013 strips of camouflage that hang down \u2013 are boxing gloves, dice, bits of glass and billiard balls, the life that was lived underneath the uniforms.     All The King\u2019s Men (2014\u201315) by Fiona Hall, comprising knitted military uniforms, wire, animal bone, horns and teeth, dice, glass, leather boxing gloves, pool ball. Photograph: Clayton Glen    In the accompanying room sits earlier but related work from Hall\u2019s four-decade career. Moving between the spaces, you see the beginnings of the artist\u2019s longstanding fascination with nature, out of which has more recently grown work that deals with politics, global finance and war. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who thinks that art necessarily changes the world,\u201d Hall says. \u201cI would never have thought when I started out with my art practice that I would end up making work that was quite concertedly referencing some of these issues. But maybe as one gets older you gain a different kind of awareness, and the emphasis of your work changes.\u201d If Wrong Way Time is a feat of both craftsmanship and concept, it\u2019s also a feat of packing peanuts. \u201cThis is one of the most complex installations that we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says Dr Deborah Hart, senior curator at the National Gallery. She points out \u201cone of the great miracles of the show that made it through customs\u201d: a series of small sculptures carved from baked bread installed on an open atlas, which represent various tragedies \u2013 environmental, cultural and militaristic \u2013 that occurred in the region on which it sits (Crust).      \u2018Even Fiona was quite amazed that these had arrived intact\u2019: Crust (2014\u201315) by Fiona Hall, comprising carved baked bread and atlases. Photograph: Supplied    One bread carving is of intricate barbed wire; another, an exploded village on a map of Syria, with tiny bricks of bread strewn across it. \u201cEven Fiona was quite amazed that these had arrived in tact,\u201d says Hart. Fiona has always been \u201ca great collector of things\u201d, Hart continues, from bank notes to bottles, from clocks to cans. In one particularly remarkable installation, Manuhiri (Travellers), she has collected a giant mandala of anthropomorphic driftwood found in New Zealand. Some resemble various animals so closely it\u2019s hard to believe they were naturally occurring.  \u201cWhen they don\u2019t speak to her, she puts them back,\u201d says Hart. \u201cSo the ones that she actually chose all had this feeling of something about them, which she brings out by gently whittling.\u201d     Fiona Hall in front of Manuhiri (Travellers) (2014\u201315), a collection of driftwood from New Zealand\u2019s Waiapu river. Photograph: National Gallery of Australia    The one collaborative work in the room is a 40-piece installation called Kuka Irititja (Animals from Another Time): whimsical, otherworldly beings woven from native grasses by Hall and a group of 12 Tjanpi desert weavers, when she spent two weeks near Pilakatilyuru, where the Northern Territory, South Australian and Western Australian borders meet. Two of the women she worked with \u2013 Mary Pan and Rene Kulitja \u2013 came to Canberra for the exhibition launch on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a privilege, such a huge thing in my life experience so far, to be able to go and spend a couple of weeks at a time in the desert working with them,\u201d says Hall. \u201cI\u2019m very proud and honoured that they were part of it as well.\u201d \u2022 Fiona Hall\u2019s Wrong Way Time is at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, until 10 July",
