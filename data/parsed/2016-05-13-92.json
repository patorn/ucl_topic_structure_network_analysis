  "body": "Phidias would be rolling in his tomb to see his creations confined in a long, narrow, miserable room in some barbaric grey metropolis of the north (Letters, 10 May). This wretched environment should be contrasted with the spacious exhibition hall in the stunning new museum built at the foot of the Acropolis alongside the meandering, herb-redolent paths the great master himself would have trodden. Filled with the ethereal light of Athens, this mellow hall waits for the return of the Parthenon marbles which are so symbolic for the embattled Greek nation. Bring them back now.Julia CrossSitia, Greece \u2022 Re Orgreave and Saltley (Letters, 9\u00a0May): from 1970 to 1990 I was active in Birmingham politics and I remember noticing more than once that West Midlands police were investigating the actions of South Yorkshire simultaneously with the investigation of West Midlands by South Yorkshire. Cynic that I was, I was not surprised that in each case there was exoneration. Maybe these cases could now be re-examined.David HarrisonBirmingham \u2022 I like Robert Peston for his forthrightness, knowledge and laid-back approach (He\u2019s bleeding nervous \u2013 but Peston cuts the ties in fine style, 9 May), but I must question his judgment. Doesn\u2019t he realise that, with a 10am Sunday slot, he\u2019s going head to head with the Archers Omnibus?Rob ParrishStarcross, Devon \u2022 It would be good to have the evidence of either Edmund Ironside\u2019s or Edgar Aetheling\u2019s coronation (Letters, 14 May), without which they could not be deposed, as far as I can understand the rather unclear rules of the 11th century. The confidence of most of your correspondence on the subject of medieval kings\u2019 nationality is surprising. It is a difficult subject.Susan ReynoldsLondon \u2022 Thanks Dave, it\u2019s not enough to make me vote Tory but still the best announcement you\u2019ve made in six years (Register could see super-rich quit London, 13 May).Les BrightExeter, Devon \u2022 \u201cTrainee teachers from the north of England are being asked to tone down their accents so as to be better understood in the classroom, a study has suggested\u201d (Report, 13 May). Sixty-three years a proud northerner with an Oldham accent with 40 (and still counting) years as a teacher in London, I\u2019m changing nowt.Dr Les GarnerLondon  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
