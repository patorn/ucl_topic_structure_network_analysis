  "body": "Jordan Henderson has confirmed he could be fit for Liverpool\u2019s Europa League final against Sevilla next Wednesday after recovering from a knee ligament injury. The Liverpool captain was ruled out for six to eight weeks after damaging his lateral collateral ligament in the quarter-final first-leg draw at Borussia Dortmund on 7 April. An intensive rehabilitation programme has given the midfielder a chance of playing inside six weeks against Unai Emery\u2019s side in Basel. Henderson, who returned to light training this week, said: \u201cThere were doubts [of missing the final]. We knew it would be close but in the last week or two I\u2019ve progressed really well. I\u2019m feeling stronger all the time. I\u2019m looking good so far but there are still a few days to go. Hopefully I will be even stronger by the time the final comes round. \u201cEvery player wants to play in a European cup final. I\u2019m no different. I\u2019m desperate to be involved but at the same time I need to make sure I\u2019m ready. I know you\u2019ve got big tournaments around the corner but my focus is solely on the cup final and, if I can get ready for that, it will be massive for me. We will have to wait and see.\u201d Henderson was at risk of missing the European Championships, with LCL injuries sometimes necessitating a three-month lay-off, but he will be fit for the summer, if short on match fitness, when Roy Hodgson announces his England squad on Monday. The captain added: \u201cI\u2019ve done everything I\u2019ve been asked to do. The medical team have been fantastic to get us back as quickly and as safely as possible. The fitness team have been brilliant as well to make sure I\u2019ve maintained my fitness since I\u2019ve been injured. I feel good at the minute. The last week or two I\u2019ve progressed really well and in the next few days I hope to do the same.\u201d",
