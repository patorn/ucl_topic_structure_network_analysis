  "body": "Don DeLillo is often cited as the Great American novelist, or as the New York Review of Books called him, \u201cthe chief shaman of the paranoid school of American fiction\u201d. He himself says he writes not simply in English but \u201cAmerican\u201d, and has received just about every other award that the US establishment can throw at him.   Related: Don DeLillo: \u2018I think of myself as the kid from the Bronx\u2019    Even so, DeLillo has never written like an insider, or behaved much like one. He no longer carries around a card saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it\u201d to give to members of the press, but he still carries a mystique. You may have enjoyed noticing how many \u201crare\u201d interviews appeared in the run-up to the release of Zero K, for instance. He also, crucially, writes from the point of view of people who don\u2019t quite fit into the world in which they find themselves. People who often seem to be trying to decipher and translate messages from elsewhere. Perhaps part of his ability to speak so well for America comes from his understanding that it is (or at least, it was) a country full of such outsiders. As he told the Paris Review: \u201cAmerica was and is the immigrant\u2019s dream, and as the son of two immigrants I was attracted by the sense of possibility that had drawn my grandparents and parents. This was a subject that would allow me to develop a range ... a range and a freedom.\u201d He has also described travelling a similar psychological distance to his parents, when he crossed the bridge from his own Italian neighbourhood in the Bronx to Manhattan. He was arriving somewhere different and baffling \u2013 and it was this realisation that partly inspired his first novel, Americana.    Blacksmith seems like a safe, quiet dream of the US, in the same middle-American territory as the Simpsons' Springfield    He must have undergone a similar mental transition when writing White Noise. Only this time it was as the quintessential New York native, the determinedly difficult novelist who was \u201cpart of a long modernist line starting with James Joyce\u201d, ending up in a \u201csmall-town setting\u201d. Not that the character Murray Jay Siskind in any way speaks for the novelist. But you can imagine a wry smile from the author as he describes this fellow New Yorker\u2019s attempts to come to terms with suburban life, declarations such as: \u201cI can\u2019t help being happy in a town called Blacksmith. I\u2019m here to avoid situations...\u201d The assumption that Blacksmith will be free of \u201csituations\u201d turns out to be wide of the mark \u2013 but it\u2019s easy to understand why Murray thinks so. Blacksmith seems like a safe, quiet dream of the US, occupying the same vaguely middle-American territory as the cartoon Springfield \u2013 and much like the Simpsons\u2019 hometown, Blacksmith is recognisably typical, even if much about it is heightened, teetering on the absurd. It\u2019s an ideal location for DeLillo to wander into, with his outsider\u2019s ability to see the strange in the everyday, and to start testing out ideas about what it means to experience America. How it feels to be embedded in a world of mantra-like jingles, of consumer bounty, of lines of station wagons and of the promise of better living through chemistry and technology. As I read this satire of US culture and assumptions I was curiously reminded of another outsider view of America. I kept thinking about the very English (and Old Etonian) Aldous Huxley\u2019s transposition of what he saw as American culture on to a futuristic London in Brave New World. In fact, Blacksmith could be taken as a realisation of everything Huxley feared about \u201cAmericanisation\u201d. Like Huxley, DeLillo describes characters so distracted by the products in the supermarket, by goofy entertainers (Elvis Presley in White Noise), and by unstoppable media saturation, that they don\u2019t even notice their own slavery. Once I started along this line, I started seeing parallels everywhere. Huxley\u2019s characters worship \u201cFord\u201d, DeLillo\u2019s say \u201cToyota Celica\u201d in their sleep with religious fervour. In Brave New World, the drug soma offers a holiday from reality; in White Noise, Dylar takes away the fear of death. Such parallels are interesting and come from a similar standpoint, slightly removed from an all-immersive culture. But the differences between the books are just as telling as the similarities. DeLillo\u2019s Blacksmith is a more complicated place than Huxley\u2019s future London, even if it also seems like a cartoon version of the US. In Brave New World, the counterpoint dystopia comes in the form of John the \u201csavage\u201d, whose apparently primitive instincts allow him to see beyond the fetters of the World State and to escape them. Savagery is presented as an antidote to technology and all it brings. In White Noise, there\u2019s a different equation at work. As DeLillo explains it (again to the Paris Review): \u201cAs technology advances in complexity and scope, fear becomes more primitive.\u201d Here, our primal instincts don\u2019t help us overcome technological oppression; instead, they are subject to technology. They also leave us ever more in thrall to the consumer world. Jack Gladney\u2019s rich American life, full of distractions and material possessions, drives him and his wife Babette ever deeper into the most basic of all problems: how to avoid dying. Their solution is to seek out the advanced medical technology of Dylar, which becomes a brilliant metaphor for the empty promise of the American dream. Not least because it doesn\u2019t seem to work as it should. And it sends Jack and Babette yet further into despair and desperation. Small wonder that Babette complains, \u201cThe theme of this story is my pain \u2026 and my attempts to end it.\u201d Viewed this way, it seems that DeLillo has conjured an even bleaker scenario than Huxley. In his world, there\u2019s no point trying to fight back, or question, or even try to ease your pain because to do so is to go against the inevitable. \u201cAll plots tend to move deathward.\u201d It\u2019s bleak. You can see why, writing in the Washington Post, the columnist Jonathan Yardley accused DeLillo of holding \u201can ostentatiously gloomy view of American society\u201d. Yet as always with Don DeLillo, there\u2019s another layer. The bleakness is offset by, to quote Murray Jay Siskind, \u201ca wonderful brimming spirit of innocence and fun\u201d. Just as Murray urges his students to take delight in the \u201ccan-do\u201d spirit of movie recreations of car crashes (surely a reference to another quintessential outsider, JG Ballard), so DeLillo invites us to enjoy Jack Gladney\u2019s attempts to escape overwhelming events like the airborne toxic event, and his own death. Nor are we just laughing at him: we also sympathise with him and appreciate his rich sense of the absurd. How not to like someone who asks the boy planning to break the world record for sitting in a cage with snakes: \u201cDo you understand that you are risking death for a couple of lines in a paperback book?\u201d By the end of the book, it\u2019s hard not to feel close to Jack Gladney, for all his faults. We have to have some sympathy, after Don DeLillo has allowed us to spend so long in his home, among the intimate, affectionate back and forth of family life, following him around so much of Blacksmith. It\u2019s hard not to feel that we have been given an inside view, even if we also have an outside perspective.",
