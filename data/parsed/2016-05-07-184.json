And they\u2019re using the money to finance everything from home extensions to IVF treatment. According to the latest data, so-called second charge mortgage lending is galloping ahead and has leapt to its highest level since 2008. During the year to 29 February, \u00a3887m of second mortgages were taken out by homeowners. That\u2019s 36% up on the year to February 2015, and more than three times the \u00a3293m of second mortgages in 2011-12. Why are people choosing to saddle themselves with a second mortgage? How do they work, how expensive are they, and what are the downsides? And why not just take a further advance from your existing lender? A second charge mortgage is a loan that allows you to use any equity you have in your home as security, and it effectively sits on top of your existing mortgage. You usually get one from a separate lender \u2013 there are a number of specialist firms. If you take one out, it means you will have two mortgages on your home; the main mortgage will always take precedence over the second home loan. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to just remortgage \u2013 or take out a further advance from the same lender \u2013 if you need to raise some extra cash? The answer is that for some people it wouldn\u2019t make sense to refinance their main mortgage, while others don\u2019t have that option. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always suit borrowers to remortgage,\u201d says Mark Harris, chief executive of broker SPF Private Clients. \u201cFor example, borrowers with a super-low lifetime base rate tracker may potentially lose this rate if they remortgage, so they may prefer a second charge to run alongside it.\u201d The same might apply to people with interest-only deals.   Related: Home truths about remortgaging to pay off other debts    Some homeowners may find that if they approach their current lender to ask for a further loan, it will only say yes\u00a0on the condition that they re-mortgage the whole of their original mortgage at a new higher rate, or agree\u00a0to be moved from an interest-only\u00a0loan to a repayment mortgage. Other borrowers are unable to re-mortgage with their existing provider because of their age \u2013 some older borrowers won\u2019t pass the affordability tests \u2013 or a change in circumstances that has resulted in a drop in income. Meanwhile, if your mortgage has a high early repayment charge, it may be cheaper for you to take out a second mortgage rather than remortgage, points out the Money Advice Service website, set up by the government. It gives the example of \u201cJohn and Claire\u201d, who have a \u00a3200,000 five-year fixed-rate mortgage with three years left to run which has an early redemption penalty of 5% of the loan\u2019s value \u2013 ie, \u00a310,000. They want to borrow \u00a325,000 for home improvements, but if they remortgage, they will have to pay the \u00a310,000 penalty, and there is no guarantee that they will be able to get a better interest rate than they are currently paying \u2013 in fact, they may have to pay more. If they take out a\u00a0second charge mortgage, they will pay a higher interest rate on the \u00a325,000 than they pay on their main mortgage, plus the fees for arranging it, but this will still be much less than paying the \u00a310,000 penalty and possibly a higher rate on their first mortgage. A further advance from their existing mortgage lender will probably be a better bet for a lot of people. However, some homeowners have found themselves \u201ctrapped\u201d with a lender that will not allow a further advance, says specialist lender Precise Mortgages. Simon Collins, product technical manager at brokers John Charcol, has seen a big rise in the number of people applying for a second charge mortgage during the last couple of years. \u201cThey aren\u2019t as expensive as they used to be,\u201d he says, adding that they are\u00a0no longer \u201cthe dark sheep of the mortgage family\u201d.    If you need to borrow a small amount of money, you are better off going for an unsecured product such as a personal loan    Rates on second charge mortgages have indeed fallen \u2013 but some people will still feel they are too high. The lowest rate in 2012 was 6.9%, but by last year it was about 4.55%, Collins says. Last week, Precise Mortgages said it was offering rates starting at 4.45%, with base rate tracker and fixed-rate loans available from \u00a35,000, while Shawbrook Bank\u2019s rates start at 4.49%, with variable and fixed-rate loans from \u00a33,000. Some of the specialist firms charge a lot more \u2013 up to 10% or 15% in some cases, although, as Collins says, \u201cThe higher rates are likely to be for the more challenging cases \u2013 those who have probably got some adverse credit, but don\u2019t want to sacrifice their main mortgage rate.\u201d The affordability requirements for second mortgages can be less onerous than for standard home loans. Nevertheless, taking one out is \u201ca serious step\u201d, says the Money Advice Service. It adds that while some people have signed up for one in order to consolidate their debts, because a second charge mortgage can run for 25 to 30 years, this means you may end up paying more interest in the long term. You are also converting unsecured credit into secured credit, and if you don\u2019t pay your second mortgage, the lender could start possession proceedings. \u201cIf you need to borrow a small amount of money, you are better off going for an unsecured product such as a personal loan. If you don\u2019t have a large early repayment charge on your mortgage and you have some equity in your home and your circumstances haven\u2019t changed, you\u2019ll almost certainly be better off remortgaging or taking out a further advance from the same lender,\u201d states the Money Advice Service website. One bit of good news is that, as of March this year, both first and second charge mortgages are now regulated under the same regime by the Financial Conduct Authority (the latter used to be separately regulated as consumer credit). The Finance & Leasing Association, which issued the latest industry data, says that although new lending in the second charge mortgage market jumped in 2015, \u201cit remained significantly below pre-crisis levels, when it peaked at more than \u00a35bn [a year].\u201d",
