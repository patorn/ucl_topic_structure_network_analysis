  "body": "With the Mill\u2019s favourite old schoolfriends Pep, Mou and Zlatan likely to be shooting it out in Manchester next season, you\u2019d think Merseyside might be in danger of missing out somewhat. Not so. That\u2019s because Liverpool are making eyes at Gonzalo \u2013 Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, that is, the record-breaking Napoli sharpshooter who has apparently said he wants to join up with J\u00fcrgen Klopp and company. He just has to force his exit from Naples first. Football is full of these joyful sagas at the moment.   Related: Marcus Rashford earns \u00a320,000-a-week long-term deal from Manchester United    If that\u2019s a case of making lemonade from lemons, slightly more bitter news is that United are leading the chase to sign Reece Oxford from West Ham, with an initial \u00a310m bid on the cards \u2013 although Manchester City are on the case too. In news of another young player linked with United \u2013 hasn\u2019t anyone been told who their new manager is, etcetera and so forth \u2013 they are interested in Sunderland\u2019s 22-year-old goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who would presumably turn into a Richard Wright-style serial benchwarmer. Goalkeepers \u2013 and goalkeepers with United connections \u2013 are in vogue this morning. Leicester are about to snaffle up Ron-Robert Zieler, who began his career at United, from Hannover 96, with his club having confirmed that talks are under way. They also plan to engage free agent Luis Hern\u00e1ndez, a defender formerly of Sporting Gij\u00f3n, in their title defence. Could Kurt Zouma become the new Petr Cech? No, he\u2019s not about to don the gloves and exhibit a worrying vulnerability at his near post \u2013 but he could be following the goalkeeper\u2019s path to Arsenal, with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said to have made contact with Chelsea about signing the commanding centre-back. Meanwhile, Shane Long is going absolutely nowhere if Southampton have their way. They\u2019re waving a lucrative new contract under his nose to stop Liverpool and Tottenham having ideas, with Mauricio Pochettino having apparently watched him \u2013 or, if other reports have it correctly, the AZ striker Vincent Janssen \u2013 in Ireland\u2019s draw against Holland last week. Also going nowhere is Dimitri Payet, who is \u201cprobably\u201d going to stay at West Ham next season. That settles that.",
