  "body": "Arsenal are close to securing the arrival of Granit Xhaka from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach as their first major signing of the summer, with the Switzerland international having travelled to London to undertake a medical. Negotiations with the Bundesliga club have been on-going over the last few weeks with M\u00f6nchengladbach having initially hoped to raise as much as \u00a335m through the midfielder\u2019s sale. A compromise has since been reached at what is believed to be an initial \u00a325m, with further fees due in future dependent on honours and appearances.   Related: David Ginola \u2018recovering in hospital\u2019 after quadruple bypass surgery    The German club\u2019s position has been rather undermined by the fact a \u00a323m release clause in Xhaka\u2019s current contract would have become active next year. The 23-year-old, who made his name at FC Basel before moving to Germany four years ago, had indicated a desire to move to England with Arsenal looking to bolster their central midfield ranks with both Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini to be released when their contracts expire at the Emirates Stadium this summer. The Swiss will undergo his medical at London Colney and finalise personal terms, with an announcement anticipated next week. Xhaka had indicated he wanted his future clarified before the European Championship finals and was granted a standing ovation by Borussia\u2019s supporters in his final appearance for the club, a 2-0 victory at Darmstadt which secured a fourth-placed finish, last week. The midfielder has been capped 40 times and will play against his parents\u2019 homeland, Albania, in the opening group game. His older brother, Taulant Xhaka, will represent Albania.",
