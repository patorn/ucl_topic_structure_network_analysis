  "body": "Ophelia Bobori probably has her daughter to thank for becoming a board member for Lewisham Homes. The social housing provider, which manages 18,000 homes on behalf of Lewisham council in south-east London, had invited Bobori to apply for the position \u2013 and her immediate reaction was that she could never do it. But her daughter, then 12, drew a small box and told Bobori that she was stuck inside the box and needed to venture outside. So she interviewed for the position and was successful.  \u201cIt has been absolutely amazing,\u201d she says of the role, to which she was appointed in September 2013. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how I\u2019ve flowered since I started on the board. I can\u2019t believe how the board has developed me, my personality \u2013 qualities I didn\u2019t know I had.\u201d     Everything in life is an experience. You may find a person inside of you that you never knew, as I did  Ophelia Bobori     Bobori, a mother of two, says her working background, first in the legal profession and now in the health industry as a pharmaceutical technician, means that she brings a capacity for probity to the board. \u201cI\u2019m a very practical person. If you bring me some evidence, I will scrutinise it and challenge it if necessary,\u201d she says. This skill, combined with being a Lewisham Homes resident herself, means Bobori can help ensure that the board sees a true reflection of what goes on at the grassroots.  She is also something of an ambassador for Lewisham Homes, representing the organisation at parliament, where she makes the case for affordable housing, as well as speaking at events about women in the workplace. Public speaking is among the skills she has discovered while being a board member: \u201cThey have brought me out of myself,\u201d she says, of the board. \u201cThey just saw something in me that I didn\u2019t see in myself.\u201d  The main challenge of being a board member is finding the time, but Bobori says it is possible. \u201cYou can squeeze it in somehow,\u201d she says. Flexibility, planning and prioritising are the key skills that help her avoid feeling stressed or overwhelmed. \u201cA little bit of discipline is involved as well, because we all get lazy, and think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll do it tomorrow\u2019. But that procrastination is the proverbial thief of time.\u201d Getting to grips with housing finance has also proved a challenge, but the board has provided training and that has beenvital, according to Bobori. \u201cThey really make every effort,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are trained in how to be effective at board level, they don\u2019t just leave you to it.\u201d   Related: As a social housing tenant, I have always been treated with dignity    A regular at community events in Lewisham, Bobori says it is important for others to see someone from a diverse background at board level \u201cbecause they see that this can be done, that it\u2019s not an impossibility\u201d. She adds that she has sometimes been shocked at the lack of diversity that exists on other housing boards, some of which don\u2019t even have residents sitting on them.  Describing herself as previously shy and retiring, she is amazed at how much more confident she feels now. \u201cEverything in life is an experience,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it\u2019s not for you, then you can move on. But you may find a person inside of you that you never knew, as I did. It changed me for the better. \u201d \u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 15 June 2016.
