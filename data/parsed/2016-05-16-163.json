Don\u2019t be too disappointed if they\u2019re not following you back, because they\u2019re probably still reading your tweets. Twitter isn\u2019t exactly the first port of call for shy and retiring types, particularly if you use it under your own name, so how do you approach social media if you\u2019re a super-secret spy agency? Use it as an excuse to improve your personal brand We know GCHQ is full of boffins all working to hack our iPhones, listen to conversations with lasers pointed at windows, and generally undertake nefarious spycraft. This is creepy and unusual, but the Twitter account is a chance to distract us with hilarious content.    New home! I've arrived! pic.twitter.com/N7PeuSti4I\u2014 Embassy Cat (@EmbassyCat) May 9, 2016    Just like Julian Assange\u2019s pet cat\u2019s account, you can use Twitter to show us the softer, cuddlier side of the organisation. What are the amusing messages you guys leave on the communal fridges? What\u2019s the funniest sext you\u2019ve intercepted from a member of Plaid Cymru? Why not jump into the saved drafts of Britain\u2019s finest comedians and pinch some material before they\u2019ve tweeted it \u2013 it isn\u2019t tweet theft if it\u2019s still a draft. You could get a few retweets by leaking the end of the next two Star Wars films, or showing us Donald Trump\u2019s tax receipts, and maybe we\u2019d overlook the vast technological power at your disposal to track our lives if you did. It\u2019s worth a try. Don\u2019t tweet stuff out of context Beware the capacity for people on Twitter to read what you say completely out of context and in bad faith. It is not a medium for nuance, subtlety, irony or sarcasm. You should probably hand your account to one of your hypernerds, so that he or she can tweet stuff that is incapable of being misunderstood.    Hello, world. https://t.co/SROtSsE8KB\u2014 GCHQ (@GCHQ) May 16, 2016    Resist the urge to be too nerdy though \u2013 nobody wants to read tweets in binary. Don\u2019t use it to arrange your social life  First there is nothing more cringe-inducing and gauche than using public tweets to arrange to meet up with people in the real world. If you genuinely do have an interesting social life, you don\u2019t need to tweet about it. Second, it\u2019s probably best for spies to avoid advertising their weekend plans \u2013 you\u2019re not the only security agency monitoring Twitter. DON\u2019T USE ALL CAPS Don\u2019t use crazy shouty caps unless it\u2019s an emergency. They\u2019re deeply uncool, and will probably also make people fear for the future of the country. If there\u2019s some sort of imminent cybersecurity threat, then hit caps lock, but if you just have an extreme reaction to a piece of celebrity gossip, hold off. Hilarious animated gifs won\u2019t make us feel better about mass surveillance   Don\u2019t try to turn the ceaseless monitoring of the population with your giant supercomputers into some kind of meme. Distract us from your purpose, don\u2019t remind us what you\u2019re actually doing. Nobody wants to recall that you guys have the gizmos to read old Snapchats or dig up our AOL messages from when we were teenagers, because that sort of embarrassment would genuinely kill us. Be careful not to tweet from the wrong account or DM fail    Ed Balls\u2014 Ed Balls (@edballs) April 28, 2011    GCHQ doesn\u2019t need to start criticising members of the intelligence and security committee as \u201cboring snoring\u201d or accidently upload pictures of someone\u2019s breakfast. If you guys can\u2019t keep up your Twitter security, what possible hope is there for the rest of the realm? DM fails from the communications branch of our intelligence service would be equal parts amusing and terrifying. Don\u2019t let the trolls get you down  You\u2019re going to receive some hostility, whatever you say and do, because that\u2019s what Twitter is about. Don\u2019t start using your powers to exact revenge, however tempting that might be. Just ignore them. I appreciate that for professional reasons you probably don\u2019t want to start muting people, but you can make the most of your verified status (congrats on that) by only looking at your mentions from other verified people. Don\u2019t use a bot Resist the urge to code some bot to tweet on your behalf. Microsoft tried that one and it became a Holocaust-denier. Stay human. Don\u2019t let it distract you too much from the day job    Learn more about the birth of British Signals Intelligencehttps://t.co/3nkdWCaacO pic.twitter.com/CZGW8dNcra\u2014 GCHQ (@GCHQ) May 16, 2016    The worst thing about Twitter is probably the disgusting amount of time you\u2019ll find you spend on it. Please don\u2019t drop the ball while you\u2019re arguing the merits of Brexit or reading lengthy debates about intersectionality. Try to stick to the day job. The people you follow suggest you\u2019re going to focus on security (except for Katherine Jenkins, that\u2019s an interesting choice?) so hopefully this is all just a big PR exercise, and not the beginning of an awful, time-eating addiction from which there is no escape.",
