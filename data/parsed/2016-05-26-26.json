The former track cyclist, who successfully switched to jump racing in an experiment backed by a leading bookmaker, has been outspoken in her support for Jess Varnish following her criticism of Shane Sutton, the former performance director . Pendleton confirmed that the way she was treated by Sutton and the culture at British Cycling had played \u201ca big part\u201d in her decision to retire. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay working with those people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf, four years ago, they\u2019d made the changes that they\u2019ve made now, I would\u2019ve been a lot happier and probably would\u2019ve performed better.\u201d After Varnish was dropped from the high performance programme she said Sutton had made sexist comments and treated her badly. Paralympic cyclists then also made allegations against Sutton, saying he had called them \u201cgimps\u201d and \u201cwobblies\u201d, forcing him to resign. The 35-year-old said she had put her name forward to contribute to the wide ranging review being conducted into British Cycling\u2019s culture in the wake of Sutton\u2019s departure but believed it should report before the Rio Olympics rather than after. \u201cThings could be done sooner, especially in an Olympic cycle,\u201d said Pendleton, who was speaking at the BBC\u2019s launch of its Olympic coverage and will travel to Rio as a pundit for the broadcaster.           Victoria Pendleton in action at Wincanton     \u201cIt\u2019s not something you really want to leave continuing the way it is. Changes should be made and people should be able to just move on, in my opinion.\u201d But Pendleton said she had faith in the process and the review headed by the British Rowing chair, Annamarie Phelps. It was announced this week that the panel would include the former England rugby union coach Stuart Lancaster. \u201cIt was never going to happen at an earlier stage, unfortunately. And, when you\u2019re in the team, you keep your head down and you do what you\u2019re told because you want to be part of it. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right,\u201d said Pendleton. \u201cIt was going to happen sometime. It would be na\u00efve to think that it wasn\u2019t ever going to come out.\u201d Pendleton said it was a \u201creal shame\u201d and \u201cshortsighted\u201d not to consider Varnish for the team: \u201cShe\u2019s got way more talent than I ever had. She\u2019s much more physically gifted and mentally resilient.\u201d But she predicted the turbulence surrounding the team would not affect Britain\u2019s chances of medals at the Olympics. When Pendleton backed Varnish, Sutton said he was surprised, given what he had done for her career. Asked about his response, she said: \u201cNothing surprises me about him. Nothing. It never will. It never could do.\u201d",
