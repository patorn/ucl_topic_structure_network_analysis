The celebrities met by Charles and Camilla in the throne room included Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, as well as Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Jeremy Irons and Tom Hooper. Other recent winners at the reception were Mark Rylance, Jenny Beavan, Vanessa Redgrave, Jim Broadbent, Asif Kapadia, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sir Michael Caine.  Upon seeing the prince, Thompson cried: \u201cIt\u2019s you! You look gorgeous.\u201d She later explained: \u201cHe\u2019s an old friend. And I will always make a loud noise when he comes into any room, and he knows that. But he does ask me to pipe down. Someone\u2019s got to do it. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of gigs for HRH in the old days when he wanted entertaining. I\u2019ve got my own cap and bells.\u201d Thompson, who won an Oscar in 1993 for her role in Howards End and an adapted screenplay award in 1996 for Sense and Sensibility, has never played royalty and said she harboured no desire to do so.  \u201cThey\u2019re much better at it than any of us could ever be,\u201d she said, before praising the royal family\u2019s ability to juggle \u201ctheir private lives\u201d with \u201cthe role they have to play in society, which is very demanding\u201d.  Caine likewise said he had not considered playing a king and \u201cnever thought of myself in the royal mould. I\u2019m definitely working class. I can\u2019t think of a single royal who has a cockney accent. Maybe I\u2019ll be that little boy who\u2019s just been born, when he grows up.\u201d The actor, who is now 83, has been nominated six times for an Oscar and won twice \u2013 for Hannah and her Sisters and The Cider House Rules. A fortnight ago, the prince took to the stage to read lines from Hamlet alongside the likes of Dench and Benedict Cumberbatch at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford\u2019s event to mark the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare\u2019s death. Caine reported himself \u201cstunned\u201d by the performance: \u201cI thought it was going to be an impressionist. Then he did it and he did it very well.\u201d Despite this, however, Thompson said she thought the connection between the monarchy and the performing arts had been stronger in previous centuries.  \u201cParticularly with the Princes of Wales, of course, because they were very keen on their actresses. Obviously the Prince of Wales now has no time or truck with such unstable characters. The Queen would think we\u2019re all just frivolous and dreadful and can\u2019t ride.\u201d Cheryl Boone, the president of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences, who appeared alongside the chief executive, Dawn Hudson, said British talent had been disproportionately dominant at the Oscars because of the country\u2019s \u201ccommitment to training and the craft and creative\u201d.  The evening \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 comes as Isaacs seeks to shake up the membership of Academy voters following criticism that no non-white people were nominated for acting Oscars for the second consecutive year.  At Wednesday\u2019s event, Isaacs would not be drawn on whether she felt the UK was more or less effective than the US at promoting diverse talent. Yet some of the winners present expressed scepticism about the extent to which on-screen talent was representative of the country at large. Dench reported that she, like fellow Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne, had funded acting students unable to afford their fees and rent. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying that training is so expensive. I don\u2019t know how many letters I get a week from young actors wanting to go to drama school and not having the money to get them through.\u201d  Caine, meanwhile, said he was concerned that the popularity of reality shows was leaving many people ill equipped both to enter the business and then to deal with getting exposure too early. \u201cThese days they just say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be an actor because I want to be rich and famous.\u2019 They can\u2019t really act. \u201cI\u2019ve watched it ruin people,\u201d said Caine of short-lived acclaim. \u201cBy the time they\u2019re 30 they\u2019re through.\u201d Thompson echoed the sentiment, saying: \u201cI think early fame is generally speaking pretty disastrous,\u201d and adding that social media exacerbates such situations, \u201cbecause it interferes with your capacity to develop because it\u2019s so difficult to fail. You can\u2019t fail privately and failure is such an important part of learning. For some people it\u2019s just too hard.\u201d She also bemoaned the increasing trend for studios to cast actors based on the scope of their following on Twitter, as well as the co-opting of non-actors into the profession on the back of their social media profile. \u201cIf they\u2019re good then, all right, fine. But I\u2019d say that is rare. Perhaps it\u2019s fuddy-duddy of me to be worried [about social media], but it does worry me dreadfully.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 May 2016. An earlier version said Emma Thompson won an Oscar for her role in The Remains of the Day. She was nominated for that film, but won the Oscar the previous year for her role in Howards End.",
