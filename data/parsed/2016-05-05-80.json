  "body": "Ellery Roberts\u2019 former band Wu Lyf were accomplished hype machinators, generating industry appetite for their guitar rock by turning novelty tricks like advertising demo tapes of their guitar rock for \u00a350 on Myspace. Roberts\u2019 new outfit is seemingly uninterested in such hijinks \u2013 but that\u2019s also the sell. Created with his Dutch artist-girlfriend Ebony Hoorn, LUH is billed as the pair\u2019s passion project, and there\u2019s a thread of fevered, vaguely political idealism that runs through the album. That hook, however, is no match for the music itself, in which the gravelly bombast of Roberts\u2019 vocal \u2013 which sacrifices consonants, syllables, even whole words to a stream of rousing vowels \u2013 is nicely supplemented by Hoorn\u2019s heavily accented near-monotone, over a mix of electronics and emotional goth-rock. It\u2019s a combination that is gratifyingly peculiar and, thanks to a knack for satisfying toplines, holds a significant amount of jubilant appeal.",
