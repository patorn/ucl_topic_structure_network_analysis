  "body": "David Leyonhjelm is \u201cdisappointed\u201d his policy adviser Helen Dale has quit mid-election campaign, according to a leaked email reportedly from the senator which hints at divisions within the office. According to the email, obtained by Crikey, Leyonhjelm said Dale quit after getting \u201cupset on Wednesday at being subjected to oversight on Facebook stuff\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that she chose to quit in the middle of a very intense campaign, but I expected her to leave after the election anyway. She probably would have stayed if I had put her in charge, but then my other staff would have left,\u201d the email said.

Writing on Twitter, Dale denied she had leaked the email on which the report was based:    Also just confirming I did not leak that letter from David, simply because I haven't been around to leak anything. @JoshButler @joshgnosis\u2014 Helen Dale (@_HelenDale) May 30, 2016    The email praised Dale\u2019s skills and said she would need to be replaced during the campaign before an adviser could be hired after the election. \u201cFirst of these is writing. She is an excellent writer and a reliable copy-editor. I\u2019m surrounded by staff who can\u2019t punctuate and who put capital letters in the wrong places, so I\u2019m going to require someone for that role (Duncan and I can do it, but we\u2019re both pretty pushed). I\u2019m hoping I can hire someone on a short-term contract for the rest of the campaign. If you have any thoughts as to who might be suitable, let me know asap,\u201d it said.   Related: The return of Helen Demidenko: from literary hoaxer to political operator | Jeff Sparrow    Dale, also known as Helen Darville, won the prestigious Miles Franklin literary award for her novel The Hand That Signed the Paper which was published under her pseudonym Helen Demidenko. The novel, about Ukrainian participation in war crimes against the Jews in the 1940s, was considered a hoax because Dale falsely claimed to have Ukranian heritage. The email also noted Dale was \u201cquite good at social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter\u201d.  The email proposed hiring the Liberal Democrat party founder, John Humphreys, for the role, paying him a lump sum of $5,000 cash. \u201cWe\u2019ll ignore tax etc. I could possibly put him on the taxpayer\u2019s payroll but it would be a lot of paperwork. I\u2019ve discussed it with him and he\u2019s willing and available, and understands he\u2019s not driving the strategy,\u201d it said. Dale retweeted a tweet that said \u201cI actually respect quitting a job because you wanted to shitpost more on Facebook, well done\u201d.     Helen Dale\u2019s retweet of a social media post approving of \u2018quitting a job because you want to shitpost more on Facebook\u2019. Photograph: Twitter    She then joked about her social media skills:    Also confirming I am an excellent shitposter and do not need to be told how to do it :) @joshgnosis @JoshButler\u2014 Helen Dale (@_HelenDale) May 30, 2016    A spokesman for Leyonhjelm said: \u201cWe can confirm Helen Dale has left her position in the office of Senator Leyonhjelm and we thank her for her contribution. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate to discuss private arrangements in the media, except to say we are complying with all tax requirements.\u201d",
