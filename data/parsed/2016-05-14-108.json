  "body": "I\u2019m growing more and more anxious. Even though I am more self-assured now, my need to always do better and improve myself is stronger. I must seem very worried and concerned most of the time \u2013 and it\u2019s because I am. My work carries great responsibility. My childhood was difficult. I grew up in Rome during the Second World War. First the city was occupied by the Germans, then the Allies arrived. Sometimes we didn\u2019t have enough to eat. After the war ended, I discovered all the terrible things that had happened elsewhere and felt quite lucky. I\u2019m happy to have won an Oscar, at last. Tarantino didn\u2019t show me the movie when he asked me to write the music for The Hateful Eight \u2013 he just sent me the Italian translation of the script. I liked it, as did my wife, so I said yes. Meeting my wife Maria, and marrying her, are the most romantic moments of my life. She was a friend of one of my sisters. We have been married for 60 years. When I was 40, I told her I would stop composing film music and dedicate my time to what I call my \u201cabsolute music\u201d. I said it again at 50, 60, 70 and 80. Maybe when I get to 90, I will stop.    Sergio Leone didn\u2019t recognise me when he asked me to write the Fistful of Dollars music. We\u2019d been at school together    I dislike cats. I like horses, some monkeys, and sweet dogs that aren\u2019t too aggressive. I used to have a wonderful big cat, and one day I came into the kitchen and it was on the table, ruining all the food we were about to eat. I was so annoyed that I took it to a friend\u2019s house in the country. Sergio Leone didn\u2019t recognise me at first. We were at school together for a year when we were very young. But when he came round and asked me to write the music for A Fistful of Dollars, he didn\u2019t know I was the same Morricone as the kid from primary school. We soon realised, and I said yes. My favourite type of pizza is a Napoletana: tomatoes, mozzarella and very few anchovies. It must have a thin base. I don\u2019t know the names of any pop musicians. Pop music is standardised; it\u2019s made to please the largest audience possible. I also compose to please a large audience, but when you listen to my music, you understand that I have studied and applied the whole history of composition. Sometimes I say: \u201cNo \u2013 I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d Working with [Italian director] Pier Paolo Pasolini was magnificent, but at first he asked me to adapt some classical pieces instead of composing original music. I refused, and he said: \u201cOK, you can write the music you wish, as long as you put these major keys in somewhere.\u201d It was a sort of superstition, so I humoured him. I wake up very early, and go to sleep early too. On a typical day, I start with some exercises, then read the newspaper. By 9am I\u2019ll start writing music, and continue until lunchtime. Then I have lunch with my wife and chat to her, and resume writing until late in the afternoon. Everyone has to die. I\u2019m not particularly scared about it. What really frightens me is that if I go before my wife, I will leave her alone, and vice versa. The ideal would be to die together.
