  "body": "Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is facing a lengthy ban after the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder was charged with violent conduct for an alleged eye gouge on Diego Costa, with both Spurs and Chelsea also hit with Football Association charges following Monday\u2019s tempestuous Premier League match. The FA said the nature of Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s action was such that the usual three-match violent-conduct suspension \u201cis clearly insufficient\u201d, meaning the midfielder may miss a stretch of games at the beginning of next season. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 could be suspended for five to six matches if found guilty of pushing a finger towards Costa\u2019s eye at the end of the first half, although the Belgian has until 6pm on Thursday to appeal against the decision. The incident was not seen by the referee, Mark Clattenburg, or his assistants, during a melee at the end of the first half, but the FA has analysed TV footage to bring the charge. Off-the-ball incidents which are not seen by match officials are referred to a panel of three former referees to review. The FA also contends that the two London clubs failed to control their players on three occasions during the 2-2 draw  at Stamford Bridge. Both may receive six-figure fines following a series of ugly incidents. Nine Tottenham players were booked by Clattenburg on the night, a record for a single team in a Premier League match \u2013 with Spurs riled up against their London rivals when their title hopes were on the line. There were numerous confrontations throughout the game but two brawls \u2013 at the end of the first half and after the final whistle \u2013 stood out. The FA says Chelsea and Tottenham failed to control their players \u201cin the 45th and 87th minutes and also at the end of the game\u201d. The clubs have until 6pm on Monday to respond to the charge and are expected to receive significant fines. There will be no action taken against \u00c9rik Lamela, who appeared to step on Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s hand while the Spaniard was on the ground, as the officials did see that particular incident. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is the only individual charged by the governing body despite several players being heavily involved in the controversy, notably Michel Vorm, F\u00e0bregas and Danny Rose.   Related: Tottenham lose title hopes and all control in draw with Chelsea    Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager, encroached on the pitch to separate Rose and Willian at the end of the first half, a fracas that sparked the melee resulting in Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 raising his hand to Costa\u2019s face, but there was further controversy at full-time. The Tottenham reserve goalkeeper Vorm and F\u00e0bregas were in the thick of a brawl involving players, coaches and backroom staff by the tunnel. Guus Hiddink, the Chelsea coach, had to usher F\u00e0bregas down the tunnel before being knocked to the ground. Hiddink said many insults were being uttered in Spanish. Eden Hazard\u2019s late goal handed Leicester City the Premier League title despite Spurs taking a 2-0 lead in the match through Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. Hazard and F\u00e0bregas had spoken beforehand of their desire to end Tottenham\u2019s title hopes and there was a full\u2011blooded tempo to the match.
