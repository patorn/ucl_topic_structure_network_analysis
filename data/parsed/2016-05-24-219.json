  "body": "The jazz saxophonist\u2019s lexicon of swagger, sermonising and private introspection has entered sacred spaces since the 1990s, taken there by the hit partnership of Jan Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble \u2013 but Branford Marsalis goes further back into African American connections between jazz and the church, balancing them with European classical music\u2019s spiritual subtleties in his own way. Playing unaccompanied on soprano, alto and tenor saxes, the eldest Marsalis brother headlined the opening celebrations of the 10-day Bath international music festival at Bath Abbey.     Peep! \u2026 Branford Marsalis at the Bath International Music festival. Photograph: Julian Foxon    Marsalis\u2019s skill in using the Abbey\u2019s echo to enhance the fluidity of his soprano phrasing was plain from the opener, Steve Lacy\u2019s Who Needs It. Then Hoagy Carmichael\u2019s Stardust hinted at tenor-sax swing, a Telemann Flute Sonata of birdlike soprano peeps ended on an arresting split-note pop, and the Allemande from Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No 1 and Sonny Rollins\u2019 shruggingly swinging Doxy figured in a graceful tenor sequence. Jimmy Rowles\u2019 The Peacocks was a second-half highlight, with Japanese classical composer Ryo Noda\u2019s Mai startling in its ghostly multiphonic harmonies, deep booms and fluting trills, and a Stravinsky solo clarinet piece acquired bite and jigging vibrancy, in a sophisticated concert perfectly fitted to the occasion and the setting. The day\u2019s earlier gig by Jay Rayner, the Observer restaurant critic and creditable pianist, was rather less nuanced as jazz, but featured hilarious gut-convulsing food stories, sprightly food-themed songs \u2013 and the day\u2019s most memorable quote, that hapless menu-writer\u2019s classic: \u201cBasil-enthused pasta.\u201d   Bath international music festival continues until 29 May.
