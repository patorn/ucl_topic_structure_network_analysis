  "body": "Crisis, what crisis? Rory McIlroy has criticised what he regards as the negative perception of his 2016 to date. McIlroy has not won this year despite a consistent run of six top-10 finishes in nine strokeplay events. At the WGC Match Play Championship he was defeated in the semi-final. Context is, of course, everything. Expectation has surrounded McIlroy since his emergence on to the professional scene; he has backed that up with four major championships. It is his level of talent which fuels discussion over this supposedly barren run. \u201cI\u2019m relaxed about it,\u201d the world No3 said. \u201cIt frustrates me, I guess, the negative spin that\u2019s being put on it. I know expectations for myself are higher than other players, but you look at my record this year with a third in Abu Dhabi, a fifth in Dubai, a third at Doral, fourth in the Match Play; my bad weeks are top 10s, basically. \u201cSo it frustrates me that the narrative is: \u2018There\u2019s something missing in Rory\u2019s game\u2019 or \u2018What\u2019s wrong with Rory?\u2019 I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything wrong. It\u2019s very close. I\u2019m waiting for something to happen; I might need to make something happen but it\u2019s not as far away as I feel some people think it is. \u201cI feel very comfortable with where my game is at and I know that if I go out and play my best, or close to my best, I\u2019m going to have a great chance to win this week [at the Irish Open], next week, basically all season.\u201d Paul McGinley, McIlroy\u2019s former Ryder Cup captain, has suggested the 27-year-old\u2019s focus may be lacking. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t quite happened yet and I\u2019m trying to stay as patient as possible,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cBut sometimes that\u2019s hard to do when you feel like you\u2019re playing really well but the results aren\u2019t quite there. I just need to string four good rounds together in a tournament and I feel like from there I\u2019ll be off and running and that could be the catapult and stepping stone to another great season.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s Rory Foundation is the host of the Irish Open, in which he features at The K Club from Thursday. The tournament has not been particularly kind to him in recent times. \u201cTo be able to get involved and not just play for myself but for other people, to help other people out, I enjoy that part of it,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI want to come here, I want to help out. I want to make this one of the best tournaments in the world.\u201d",
