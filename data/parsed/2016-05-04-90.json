  "body": "Royal Ascot may be the next target for Sir Maximilian, a winner here on Wednesday, and a jockey who many assumed was slowly fading from view hopes to be going along for the ride. Kieren Fallon, six times the British champion and a man whose career has been more chequered than a chessboard, was grinning broadly as he climbed onto the podium after Sir Maximilian\u2019s victory. Fallon, it seems, is back. Again, and at least for now. Fallon has been only an occasional visitor to British tracks over the last two seasons, preferring instead to spend much of his time in the United States. He had a single winner and nine second-place finishes from 82 rides there in 2015, and no success at all from 14 rides this year before returning to Ireland, where he has formed a promising new link with Michael O\u2019Callaghan, who trains on The Curragh.   Related: Kieren Fallon: I come from nothing so everything I ever got was a bonus    Fallon enjoyed an easy victory on the speedy Sir Maximilian, a horse that has lined up for Group One events in the past, and could now be aimed towards the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot in mid-June by Ian Williams, his trainer. \u201cI like coming here, but it\u2019s just hard to get rides now,\u201d Fallon said afterwards. \u201cToo many jockeys and not enough horses, and some of the jockeys are getting too old and nobody wants them, but we\u2019ll still battle away. As long as I can get rides, I\u2019ll ride away, and I don\u2019t want to retire yet. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying it for the first time in a long time and I\u2019m feeling much better now than I did last year. They\u2019ve got a great doctor in Ireland, [the Turf Club\u2019s senior medical officer Adrian] McGoldrick, and he\u2019s sorted me out. \u201cLast year my riding was very weak and I had a lot of blood tests and things, but he was able to sort it. I didn\u2019t feel right at all for the second half of the season and I didn\u2019t know where I wanted to be. It was a blessing in disguise when Michael rang and asked me to go back to Ireland, because I had to go and do a medical and that\u2019s when things started to turn around for me.\u201d Even by the standards of this most mercurial of professions, Fallon\u2019s career has been one of wild extremes. There have been Classics, championships and double-century seasons thanks to a succession of top jobs and brilliant horses. And there have been drug bans, tabloid stings, high-profile sackings, a six-month suspension for hauling a fellow jockey from his horse and the intense scrutiny of a collapsed race-fixing trial at the Old Bailey. How long will it all continue? Fallon, now 51, is as reluctant as ever to look too far into the future. \u201cIt depends on your body,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky, I\u2019m not like some of the boys that have to waste hard in the sauna for many hours. I can eat and drink what I want, my weight\u2019s great and, thank God, I had a great career in that I didn\u2019t have too many injuries. I think when you put those together, you will last a bit longer.   Related: Fallon British comeback stalls after agent loses contact with jockey    \u201cI went to ride in San Francisco before I came back, and I was riding against Russell Baze, who is 58. He was riding two or three winners a day, a leading jockey there for however many years. You have to ride with confidence, and if you don\u2019t ride with confidence you\u2019re always going to struggle, but I\u2019m with a great trainer in Ireland now and hopefully we\u2019ll start churning out the winners very shortly. \u201cI want to ride and be busy. If I\u2019m not, there\u2019s not a lot else I want to do and I want to do it as long as I can. It\u2019s great when you get on horses like that [Sir Maximilian] that can cruise and then quicken away, it makes the job easy and you get a bit of a buzz. The way he quickened away there was impressive.\u201d",
