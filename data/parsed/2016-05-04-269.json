Sometimes we do some light lifting. Sometimes we supervise, standing by the sides with a cup of tea and point at things while someone else does the majority of the heavy lifting. This time, we\u2019ve done no lifting at all. Over to the splendidly thorough Radu Ogrezeanu-Ghica for a pretty comprehensive answer to this one: \u201cIf by \u2018European Cup\u2019 the Uefa Champions League, formerly known as the European Champion Clubs\u2019 Cup, is meant, then yes, this will be the first time two former winners will meet in the second-tier domestic competition. There are only six countries with multiple past champions, which is obviously a necessary condition: England (five), Germany, Italy, Netherlands (three each), Spain and Portugal (two each). Out of these 18 clubs, the following spent time in the second-tier domestic competitions after their European Cup win: Manchester United (74-75), Aston Villa (87-88), Nottingham Forest (93-94, 97-98, and from 99-00 onward), Milan (80-81 and 82-83), and Juventus (06-07). As can be easily seen, they never met in the second tier.   Related: Footballers sent off for taking their shirts off | The Knowledge    \u201cIf however we look at the term \u2018European cup\u2019 in a larger sense, to include all European club competitions (ie also the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, the Europa League / Uefa Cup / Inter-Cities Fairs Cup) the group becomes much larger. Countries with multiple champions are: England (13), Italy (nine), Germany (eight + one from GDR), Spain (six), Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland (three each), Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine (two each). The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia also used to have two European Cup winners, who however meanwhile are in separate countries (Ukraine / Georgia, and Serbia / Croatia respectively). The list of former winners who, after their European Cup win, spent time in lower leagues, chronologically, by country looks as follows:  England: Manchester United (74-75), Chelsea (75-76, 76-77, 79-80 until 83-84, and 88-89), Tottenham Hotspur (77-78), Newcastle United (78-79 until 83-84, 89-90 until 92-93, and 09-10), West Ham United (78-79 until 80-81, 89-91, 92-93, 03-05, and 11-12), Leeds United (82-83 until 89-90 and from 04-05 onward), Manchester City (83-85, 87-89, 97-00, and 01-02), Ipswich Town (86-87 until 91-92, 95-96 until 99-00, and 02-03 onward), Aston Villa (87-88), Nottingham Forest (93-94, 97-98, and form 99-00 onward). Italy: Milan (80-81 and 82-83), Fiorentina (93-94, 02-04), Napoli (98-00, and 01-02 until 06-07), Sampdoria (99-00 until 02-03 and 11-12), Juventus (06-07), Parma (08-09). Germany: Borussia Dortmund (72-73 until 75-76), 1 FC Magdeburg (from 91-92 onward), Eintracht Frankfurt (96-98, 01-03, 04-05, and 11-12), Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach (99-01, and 07-08). Spain: Real Zaragoza (71-72, 77-78, 02-03, 08-09, and from 13-14 onward), Valencia (86-87), Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (00-02). Scotland: Rangers (12-13 until 15-16). Belgium: KV Mechelen (97-99, 01-02, 03-07). France: Marseille (94-96). \u201cAs can be seen from the list above, these teams have met in lower leagues quite a lot in England, for the first time in 1978-79 when Newcastle United and West Ham United had been demoted together. In fact since the 74-75 season there has, with the exception of the 94-95 season, always been a former European Cup winner in the English second tier (or below). Outside England it has happened only in Italy where Napoli played in Serie B against Sampdoria (in 99-00, 01-02 and 02-03), against Fiorentina (in 03-04) and against Juventus (in 06-07). In Germany it has not happened yet, as 1 FC Magdeburg has been in lower leagues than the other former winners ever since 1991.\u201d Step right up, step right up \u2026 \u201cIn timely celebration of Leicester\u2019s finest outputs, has any professional footballer been the face of a product longer than Gary Lineker\u2019s 21 years advertising Walkers?\u201d ponders Rich Booth. Actually yes. Sort of. \u201cI was at BMP when we made the original Lineker commercial (called Welcome Home),\u201d writes advertising insider Richard Morris. \u201cA few years earlier (1989) we\u2019d made the \u2018Wake up to Milk\u2019 campaign for the National Dairy Council featuring this Ian Rush ad which became known as \u2018Accrington Stanley\u2019. I was told at the time that the original script said \u2018Ian Rush says if I don\u2019t drink milk I\u2019ll only be good enough to play for Everton\u2019; but Everton said no, followed by a no from every (first division) club approached. Accrington Stanley was then picked because at the time the club no longer existed. 25 years on, and Ian Rush is still helping out both milk and Accrington Stanley \u2013 as this story ably demonstrates \u2026 \u201cThe agency didn\u2019t just use footballers in its ads. It was also responsible for this wonderful ad. Goodness knows how the team got Muhammed Ali to agree to advertise Unigate Dairies.\u201d            Train stations v town size \u201cBurnley are served by three stations: Burnley Barracks, Burnley Central and Burnley Manchester Road,\u201d wrote James Blanchard in a spin-off question last week. \u201cThe Rose Grove station is also just within the town limits. Is this ratio of population/supporters against rail stations a record for a football club?\u201d \u201cI think Maidstone beats Burnley for the most train stations per supporter,\u201d confidently begins Graeme Harvey. \u201cMaidstone United has a ground capacity of 3,063, and also three train stations - Maidstone East, Maidstone West, and The Barracks.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d say Portsmouth has a minimum of four but a maximum of 10 if you\u2019re including all the boroughs as part of the city limits,\u201d suggests Barney Hague-Wright. \u201cThe definite train stations would be Portsmouth Harbour, Portsmouth and Southsea, Fratton, and Hilsea.\u201d   Related: Who was the first footballer to be worth their weight in gold? | The Knowledge    \u201cMy local team Greenock Morton would take some beating,\u201d posits Stephen O\u2019Donnell. \u201cThe stadium, Cappielow Park, is served by both Cartsdyke and Bogston rail stations, with a further seven rail stations (Greenock Central; Greenock West; Fort Matilda; Whinhill; Drumfrochar; Branchton; I. B. M.) located within the town limits of Greenock (population 45,000). The town has almost as many rail stations as Edinburgh: a legacy of Greenock\u2019s importance as a commercial port and shipbuilding hub. \u201cThe chief rail line also runs immediately behind the main stand at Cappielow. Train drivers sometimes slow down to give passengers a passing view of a match in progress - while the agricultural clearances favoured by lower league Scottish defenders pose a regular hazard to any passing service.\u201d Finally, Amir Arezoo writes: \u201cI think Doncaster has a good shout. The Keepmoat holds about 15,000 and Doncaster has nine stations in the \u2018metropolitan borough\u2019: Adwick, Bentley, Conisborough, Doncaster, Hatfield, Kirk Sandall, Mexborough, Thorne North and Thorne South. That\u2019s about 1,666 supporters per station...\u201d And the we have a spin-off question to the spin-off question, from Chris Parrott: \u201cWatford has 10 stations within a two-mile radius of the ground. Watford North, Watford Junction, Watford High Street, Watford (Metropolitan Line), Watford Vicarage Road (to open), Cassiobridge (to open), Bushey, Croxley Green, Carpenders Park and Moor Park. \u201cDoes any club (outside London) have more?\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cHas anyone ever been sent off for fouling his own team-mate?\u201d asked Peter Christensen back in 2004. The Knowledge\u2019s inbox was jam-packed with your tales of team-mates turning nasty, including a particularly nasty scrap in 1979 between Derek \u201cKiller\u201d Hales and fellow Charlton striker Mike Flanagan. The pair hadn\u2019t been on speaking terms for some time and when they found themselves trailing 2-0 to lowly Maidstone in an FA Cup third-round tie, it all kicked off. The pair set into each other like agitated badgers, and were promptly dismissed - Hales even found himself the proud new owner of a P45 shortly afterwards. Things almost got that bad for Craig Levein 15 years later, when he and Hearts team-mate Graeme Hogg came to blows in the bubbling cauldron of tension that is... a pre-season friendly against Raith Rovers. In full view of the handily placed TV cameras, the pair (literally) pulled no punches in their discussion of the goal conceded moments before. Both were red-carded as Hogg was stretchered off, and Levein was made to sit out 12 games and hand over two weeks\u2019 wages by the club.   Related: Aalborg v Brondby: the match that lasted six months and five days | The Knowledge    In 1995, Premiership champions Blackburn headed into their fifth Champions League group game against Spartak Moscow with the unenviable record of one goal and one point. And on the night, people barely had time to draw breath (let alone utter the words \u2018not\u2019 \u2018really\u2019 and \u2018up to this gig\u2019) before there was fighting in the Blackburn ranks. No surprise that David Batty was involved, but in fact it was Graeme Le Saux who rained in with the punches after the pair collided going for the same ball. Amazingly neither player was given his marching orders - though Colin Hendry was later red-carded, despite making a valiant attempt to withdraw from the offending tackle. Our most recent example, meanwhile, comes from Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann. In his final season with Borussia Dortmund, Lehmann was sent-off four times - the most notable for running at full pelt into the midfield to confront Marcio Amoroso over his slack defending. Some hands-round-the-neck action and a hefty shove later, Lehmann was making his way to the showers, his mood no doubt improved by the Schalke goal (which had started it all) being disallowed for offside. For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? \u201cIn the wake of Leicester\u2019s win, I was looking at Jamie Vardy\u2019s honours list on Wikipedia and note he\u2019s now got wins at levels 1, 2, 5 and 7 of the English pyramid, and all in the last five years to boot,\u201d notes Liam McGuigan. \u201cIs this the biggest difference in levels between league titles for any player, within the official league system?\u201d \u201cIn 1913 and 1914, Fram Reykjav\u00edk won the Icelandic championship by being the only team to register for the league,\u201d recalls K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThe two other teams that competed in the inaugural competition in 1912 declined to enter. Have any other national titles been won by default?\u201d \u201cArsenal had two points deducted in the 1990-91 season but still won the First Division,\u201d begins Scott Sumner. \u201cPortsmouth had nine points deducted in the 2009\u201310 Premier League season but would have been relegated regardless. Have there been many instances where crucial final positions have been decided by deductions? The only one I can think of is Middlesbrough being relegated in 1996-97.\u201d \u201cMy team, Farnborough, have recently finished 18th in the Ryman Premier Division in a 24-team division,\u201d says David Ellicott. \u201cWe dropped into the relegation zone after our second game, and only moved back out of the relegation zone after our penultimate game (our 45th game). Has any team spent more time in the relegation zone in a season and finished outside the relegation zone?\u201d \u201cWith Leicester having achieved Premier League glory it struck me that all of Gary Lineker\u2019s clubs will have won their national titles without him,\u201d writes Jez Orbell. \u201cEverton, Barcelona, Tottenham, plus Grampus 8 in Japan, have all come out on top at one time or another but he hasn\u2019t. You can even count England if you include the World Cup. Has any other player been in the right place at the wrong time more often?\u201d \u201cOn a recent episode of the BBC 5 live World Football Phone In a question regarding purple home shirts in football was raised,\u201d muses Daniel Truninger. \u201cWhile it isn\u2019t a common kit colour the likes of Fiorentina, Valladolid and Austria Salzburg were mentioned as famous teams playing in purple. As I am currently working with an Austria Vienna supporter I realised that at least two teams called Austria wear purple. After a quick Wikipedia research I found that Austria Klagenfurt also turn out in the same colour. Is there a theme which links their colour choice? It appears that calling a club \u201cAustria\u201d isn\u2019t the link since SC Austria Lustenau turn out in green.\u201d Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or get in touch via Twitter @TheKnowledge_GU",
