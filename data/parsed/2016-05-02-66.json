Related: Labour\u2019s antisemitism row may be\u00a0drama, but it\u2019s no crisis | Steve Richards    On Friday Corbyn announced an independent review of claims of antisemitism within the Labour party, in the hope of drawing a line under accusations from some MPs that he had failed to respond forcefully enough to the issue. Three councillors were suspended on Monday after evidence emerged that they had used social media to promote what appeared to be antisemitic views. The former mayor of Blackburn, Salim Mulla, who is now a councillor, had shared social media posts last August that appeared to draw a link between Zionism and Islamic State. Below photographs with slogans suggesting that support for Palestinians from France and Japan had triggered attacks by Isis, he said: \u201cIs this a coincidence. You [sic] bloody daam [sic] right it is. We all know Zionism game being played. It\u2019s bloody obvious who is manupulating[sic] this. Those who are not sure. ISRAEL.\u201d Separately, Nottingham city councillor Ilyas Aziz was found to have shared a post suggesting that Israel should be relocated to the US \u2013 the same one that resulted in the Bradford West MP, Naz Shah, being suspended last week despite making a series of public apologies. Aziz also posted a link to an article about Nazi Germany, alongside which he said: \u201cA reminder of the treatment and suffering of Jews in Nazi Germany. Are there any similarities to how Israel is treating Palestinians?\u201d   Related: I saw the darkness of antisemitism, but I never thought it would get this dark | Nick Cohen    Later on Monday a third man, Burnley councillor Shah Hussain, was suspended, after it emerged that he had told an Israeli footballer on Twitter in 2014, \u201cyou and your country\u201d are \u201cdoing exactly the same thing\u201d that Hitler did, in reference to the violence against Palestinians. A Labour spokesperson confirmed that all three had been suspended pending an investigation. It emerged on Monday night that an unknown number of other Labour members have also been suspended while the party\u2019s compliance committee investigates accusations of antisemitism against them.  A party source admitted there were more cases under review that had not yet been made public, but said reports that the figure was as high as 50 were \u201ca wild overestimate\u201d.  The source said: \u201cWhile we do not give a running commentary on numbers suspended, the majority of the Labour party\u2019s suspensions for antisemitism are in the public domain. Labour takes antisemitism very seriously and that\u2019s why Jeremy has set out a robust plan to tackle the issue.\u201d With the latest polls suggesting Labour is heading for its worst performance in local elections since 1982, and could lose up to 175 council seats, Corbyn\u2019s team are keen to turn attention away from the issue of antisemitism and focus on campaigning. Labour launched a minimalist new poster Monday night, with the slogan: \u201cElections are about taking sides: Labour is on yours.\u201d     Labour campaign poster. Photograph: Labour party/PA    A former director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, was drafted in to chair a review of the Labour party after a series of incidents that culminated in an embarrassing public spat between Ken Livingstone, former London mayor, and John Mann MP. Livingstone defended Shah in radio and TV interviews but in doing so drew links between Zionism and Hitler. He has insisted that he will contest the grounds for his suspension when his case is reviewed by Labour\u2019s national executive committee. The dispute was given fresh impetus over the weekend when Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union, claimed that the row over Corbyn\u2019s response to antisemitic incidents was the latest crisis manufactured by \u201ctreacherous\u201d Labour MPs keen to undermine the leader. Corbyn\u2019s team insists there has been no surge in antisemitic incidents since he became party leader last year; but centrist MPs are warning that some Labour leftwingers slide too easily from staunch support for the Palestinians, to making slurs against Israel. Asked whether Labour has a problem with antisemitism, Corbyn told the Mirror: \u201cNo, there is not a huge problem. What there is is a very small number of people that have said things that they should not have done. We have therefore said they will be suspended and investigated.\u201d However, the shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said on Monday that there was \u201cclearly\u201d an issue with antisemitism \u201cotherwise we would not have spent the last six or seven days talking about it\u201d. Asked on Channel 4 news if Livingstone should be expelled from the party, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult to see a circumstance where his suspension would be lifted and he would be readmitted.\u201d One backbench MP critical of Corbyn said local councillors in his constituency have been \u201chead in hands\u201d over the party\u2019s travails nationally, which they fear could lose them their seats on Thursday. However, even those Labour MPs most sceptical of the leadership say they do not expect any challenger to move against him until after June\u2019s EU referendum \u2013 and they are conscious that he retains overwhelming support among grassroots members. Meanwhile Corbyn\u2019s closest lieutenant \u2013 the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell \u2013 has publicly denied claims that he is readying himself to take over if Corbyn is unseated in a putsch, tweeting: \u201cMedia & right wing dirty tricks & lies trying to divide me and Jeremy. They should know it only unites us even more & makes us stronger.\u201d",
