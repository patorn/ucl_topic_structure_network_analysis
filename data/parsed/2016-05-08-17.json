  "body": "Aitor Karanka seemed almost overwhelmed by the scale of his achievement. \u201cI would like to go to my bed and cry for 24 hours in a row,\u201d the Middlesbrough manager said. \u201cI can\u2019t explain the emotions I have inside.\u201d Outside a party destined to last long into the Teesside night was getting under way but the Spaniard\u2019s sheer relief at securing the \u00a3170m windfall awaiting those clubs promoted to the Premier League left him looking too shattered to participate. A draining season had concluded with an edgy draw against a Brighton side who finished level on points with Boro but missed out on automatic elevation due to a fractionally inferior goal difference.   Related: Middlesbrough\u2019s Aitor Karanka thankful upon promotion to Premier League    If the tensions involved in steering his club back to the Promised Land after a seven-year exile possibly explain Karanka\u2019s March meltdown \u2013 when the manager was placed on gardening leave and missed a defeat at Charlton following a serious contretemps with his players \u2013 Chris Hughton\u2019s dignified dejection proved painful to behold. At the final whistle Hughton\u2019s assistant, Colin Calderwood, gave Boro\u2019s manager an angry shove and certain Brighton first-teamers exchanged words with home fans who had joyously invaded the pitch and were blocking the path off it. Ultimately no harm was done and, as Hughton rightly pointed out, an odd harsh exchange and a bit of chaos seemed virtually inevitable by-products of such a high-stakes occasion. Once the dust settled, Karanka dismissed suggestions he might resign and his Brighton counterpart\u2019s attentions turned to Friday\u2019s demanding play-off semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday. \u201cThere are just 20 privileged managers who can be in the Premier League and I am going to be one of them,\u201d Karanka said after reiterating that he has three years remaining his contract. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d If it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Steve Gibson, the club\u2019s owner, may still opt to part company with the 42-year-old, sacking the man who previously served as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s assistant at Real Madrid now would appear harsh. Karanka is fond of reminding everyone he has only two and a half years\u2019 managerial experience and this was something Gibson presumably took into account in deciding against dismissing him two months ago. As befits a Basque, Karanka possesses a stubborn streak and its latest manifestation left the \u00a36m Stewart Downing and the \u00a39m Jordan Rhodes, Boro\u2019s two supposed star signings this season, relegated to the bench. That pair cost a high percentage of the \u00a325m Gibson \u2013 the most generous, and supportive, of owners \u2013 has invested in the squad since last summer but neither, apparently, were Karanka\u2019s first-choice recruits. In their place he selected Cristhian Stuani (a \u00a33.5m buy) and David Nugent (\u00a35m), and this controversial choice was swiftly vindicated when the excellent Gaston Ram\u00edrez floated in a free-kick, Nugent flicked on and Stuani stuck out his left foot and stabbed home from three yards. \u201cI thought to play with Stuani because I knew he wasn\u2019t having a good season but I also know how hungry Uruguayan players are,\u201d Karanka said. \u201cI knew he had something to show.\u201d With Ram\u00edrez \u2013 on loan from Southampton but likely now to formalise his transfer to the Riverside \u2013 shining in the hole and Albert Adomah\u2019s deployment on the left rather than his preferred right helping George Friend subdue Brighton\u2019s dangerous Anthony Knockaert, Boro were in control. Then Beram Kayal began making his presence felt in central midfield. The Israel midfielder was not about to surrender and, responding to his determinedly dynamic cue, the visitors rallied. When Knockaert displayed his class with a high-calibre free-kick, Dale Stephens headed the equaliser. On a day when Teesside temperatures peaked at 10C, locals began interpreting the gathering, unseasonal mist as a bad omen. Maybe Brighton were heading for the win required to clinch promotion? Yet within three minutes Stephens\u2019s late, high, studs-up challenge on Ram\u00edrez earned a straight red card. Though Stephens may have won the ball and Mike Dean may initially have reached for a yellow card, a fellow official\u2019s voice in the referee\u2019s earpiece counselled it had been a reckless tackle and off he went. The Uruguayan required eight minutes of on-pitch treatment to a deep gash high on a shin before eventually departing on a stretcher, an oxygen mask clamped over his face. Happily Karanka later reported a stitched-up Ram\u00edrez would be \u201cfit for celebrating\u201d. After a nervy finale a corner of north-east England devastated by the death of its steel industry last autumn finally had something to shout about. \u201cFor the steelworkers who have had so much hardship, hopefully their lives will be a little brighter after this,\u201d Boro\u2019s manager said. \u201cThis area deserves a Premier League club.\u201d Man of the match Gaston Ram\u00edrez (Middlesbrough)",
