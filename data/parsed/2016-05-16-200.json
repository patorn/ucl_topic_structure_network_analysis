Related: American Honey review: Andrea Arnold mislays map on sweet, indelible roadtrip    Swedish newcomer Sverrir Gudnason is to portray the taciturn Swede Bj\u00f6rn Borg, whose cool demeanour contrasted dramatically with his American opponent\u2019s fiery temperament, during their late-70s, early-80s rivalry. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd has signed on to play the Scandinavian two-hander\u2019s coach, Lennart Bergelin. Variety reports the two leads have already begun training for their roles.  Danish director Janus Metz Pedersen, best known for 2010 Cannes festival hit war documentary Armadillo and episodes of HBO\u2019s True Detective, will work from a screenplay by Underdog\u2019s Ronnie Sandahl. The film-maker aims to begin shooting this autumn in Sweden, London, Monaco and New York for a 2017 release date, according to The Wrap. Borg won Wimbledon five times in a row between 1976 and 1980, while McEnroe went on to win the 1981, 1983 and 1984 men\u2019s singles finals.  LaBeouf can currently be seen as magazine subscription salesman Jake in Andrea Arnold\u2019s debut US-set film, road movie American Honey. The film is currently in competition for the top Palme D\u2019Or prize at the Cannes film festival. At a press conference on Sunday, LaBeouf said he felt connected to both roles. \u201cJake is me. So is McEnroe. That\u2019s it, man,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI understand these people, I empathise with them. I get it. You turn things up and turn things down. It\u2019s me.\u201d LaBeouf also said his backhand was \u201cgetting there\u201d.",
