  "body": "You know those moments when you\u2019re watching a something scary but just can\u2019t look away? That\u2019s how it is for the cat in our lead video, whose eyes seem transfixed to a horror movie until the tension gets too much and it is forced to leap away. Perhaps the sinister strings on the soundtrack (which sounds like Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho) got too much \u2013 or did it just spot a mouse? Also leaping around this week are James Corden and his Late Late Show guest Cyndi Lauper, who sing a parody of the 80s star\u2019s hit Girls Just Want To Have Fun. The song, which attacks the gender pay gap, features lyrics including \u201cGuys, if she\u2019s mad, it\u2019s not PMS \u2013 it\u2019s cause you do the same job, but she\u2019s makin\u2019 less.\u201d But who looks better in the pink wig? You decide. Our movie-related clips this week include a Screen Junkies \u201cHonest Trailers\u201d version of Deadpool \u2013 which, amazingly, features the movie\u2019s star Ryan Reynolds. Another Ryan \u2013 Gosling \u2013 proves he\u2019s a good sport by acting out a scene from his new movie The Nice Guys with a member of Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s studio audience.    Related: Ryan Reynolds appears as Deadpool in Honest Trailer    We also have vlogger Tom Syndicate sneaking onto the set of World of Warcraft \u2013 watch out for the bonus review of Captain America: Civil War (which he mistakenly calls \u201cAvengers: Civil War\u201d) at the end. And you can see footage of James McAvoy being transformed into his Charles character in X-Men: Apocalypse. It looks like having his head shaved was worth it \u2013 he\u2019s a dead ringer for a young Patrick Stewart. Finally, we have stunning close-ups of a tornado in Colorado and an equally heart-stopping trailer for the Assassin\u2019s Creed movie starring Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, plus New Girl\u2019s Zoey Deschanel explaining how producers built a bonfire to hide evidence they had invited the Kardashians to appear in a party scene with Prince. Enjoy.
