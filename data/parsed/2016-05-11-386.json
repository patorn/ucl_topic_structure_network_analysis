  "body": "Not a bellwether, but an indicator. That\u2019s how Curtin University adjunct professor of politics, David Black, describes the Western Australian seat of Cowan, which pundits have tipped will go with government when the polls close on 2 July.   Related: The 10 big issues of election 2016: how Coalition, Labor and Greens policies compare    Nestled among the soccer grounds and subdivisions of Perth\u2019s northern suburbs, Cowan is a mishmash of older conservative voters, who bought their house off the plan when the suburbs of Wanneroo, Wangara, and Marangaroo were the middle buckle on the mortgage belt, and strong migrant communities.  Cowan is held on a margin of 4.5% by Liberal MP Luke Simpkins, who succeeded Labor\u2019s Graham Edwards in 2007. In the conservative state of WA, it is one of two electorates, along with the new seat of Burt in the city\u2019s south-west, that Labor would have to win to form government. \u201cThis particular election, it seems to me that I would be saying that on election night the two seats that I would be watching closely would be Cowan and Burt,\u201d Black says. \u201cIf Labor is not making ground in Cowan then you can see straight away that it is not going to form government.\u201d To fight its battle in Cowan Labor has preselected Anne Aly, a high-profile terrorism expert and lecturer at Edith Cowan University, who just happens to be Muslim. It makes for a curious contest. Simpkins, a conservative Christian backbencher, is vocally anti-Islam. In 2011 he said that eating halal-certified food could lead to religious conversion, arguing in parliament that \u201cunwittingly eating halal food\u201d put Australians \u201cone step down the path of conversion\u201d. He later took credit for the removal of \u201cshahada symbols\u201d from a railway footbridge, which on investigation from the good burghers of the internet were revealed to be black and white stickers advertising a local nightclub. Simpkins rose to national prominence in February last year when he called for a leadership spill against then prime minister Tony Abbott. The motion, backed by the late Canning MP Don Randall, and supported by the now disendorsed member for Tangney, Dennis Jensen, was a precursor to Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s successful challenge seven months later.

Photograph: Aaron Bunch/AAP    Black says the changing demographic of the electorate makes it difficult to judge what impact Simpkins\u2019s and Aly\u2019s different stances on Islam will have on the vote. About 38% of its 158,000 residents were born overseas, making it among the state\u2019s more multicultural electorates.

At the Kingsway City shopping centre, on the western edge of the electorate, two of Simpkins\u2019s supporters have finished their weekly grocery shop.  \u201cWe\u2019re Liberal voters, always have been, always will be,\u201d says Jeff, who asks that his full name not be used. He and partner Mandy have lived in Cowan since 2000, when the area was striped with market gardens. Since then it has been targeted by infill housing developments. \u201cAll the strawberry markets have gone, it\u2019s all houses now,\u201d Jeff says. \u201cWe just can\u2019t get over the size of these postage stamp lots.\u201d Jeff and Mandy like Simpkins but are more circumspect about the performance of Turnbull, who they say could stand to be \u201ca bit more forceful, a bit more leader-like\u201d. Their key concern is economic stability, followed by education.  From the same shopping centre, five minutes later, comes Fatima. She settled in the area five years ago after arriving in Australia via boat from Afghanistan in 2010. She is unaware that her religion, Islam, is at the centre of a very careful local political fight, but says she is more concerned with education and jobs training.  \u201cWe try to have a good life, to be educated ... I am from Afghanistan, I couldn\u2019t get the chance back home to study so I am very happy I am here,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I am sad now that we don\u2019t have opportunity to study because we don\u2019t have funding.

I am a single woman and I am on Centrelink benefits. From where I can organise $3,000?\u201d  Second on her list is the government\u2019s increased security checks ahead of awarding permanent residency or citizenship status, which has seen her application for citizenship languish for a year. She wants it approved so she can bring her mother to Australia.  \u201cI am trying to learn Australian culture, I am happy to be an Australian independent woman,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now it\u2019s not fair \u2013 they should do all the security checks at the refugee camps instead of after five years.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted both Luke Simpkins and Anne Aly for comment, but neither were available.",
