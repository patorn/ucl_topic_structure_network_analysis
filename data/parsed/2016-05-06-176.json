  "body": "Every Father\u2019s Day or Mother\u2019s Day, when our children are required for a few hours to acknowledge their parents\u2019 unstinting efforts on their behalf, I am asked by one of them, usually resentfully: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a children\u2019s day?\u201d The answer reliably comes back: because every day is children\u2019s day. Then I found out there is a children\u2019s day after all \u2013 National Children\u2019s Day on 15 May. Doubtless the idea of this day is to bring attention to those children who suffer hardship and neglect. However, I have a suspicion that were my nine and 13-year-old daughters to find out about this occasion they would simply assume they were going to be entitled to some extra privileges. Nevertheless, I was somewhat encouraged to learn from the press release that it was going to \u201craise awareness about the importance of adult wellbeing \u2026 adult happiness \u2026 and [adult] mental health in the UK\u201d. Adult happiness \u2013 there\u2019s a concept I could embrace. However, it sits uneasily with the rest of the release which announces that the way we are to achieve \u201cadult wellbeing\u201d and (apparently incidentally) produce \u201cheartful and mindful\u201d children, is to \u201cenjoy\u201d informal activities such as \u201ca playing out day for local families, carrying out daily random acts of kindness during the week, holding a street party, and \u2018a go home on time\u2019 week for working parents to spend time with the family.\u201d Which sounds a lot more like simply more fun for the kids to me. I may be sounding a trifle sour at the moment. This is because a few days before writing this column a couple of things happened that made me slightly less mindful and heartful than my darling children. As a family we took The Complete Walk of Shakespeare\u2019s plays along the South Bank in London and after an hour or so we reached a screen with chairs in front. My wife and two younger daughters found chairs, but I couldn\u2019t see one. A little weary, I asked Louise, my nine-year-old, to let me sit down (I am 60, not incidentally) and to sit on my lap. She did so, but a minute later decided she wanted her chair back. I refused. As a result I was turned on as if by a trio of velociraptors, not only by Louise, but my wife and older daughter, who both insisted I was being unconscionably selfish. The atmosphere remained frosty for some time and I found myself looking forward to the catharsis I might get seeing the excerpt from King Lear. On the tube home, a young couple got up to give their seats to two kids who looked about seven. It seemed strange to someone of my generation. Once upon a time it was normal practice for children to give up their seats for adults. The most important shift in power in the last few generations is the welcome historical movement away from men towards women. It may be that the shift in power from parents towards children is part of the same phenomenon. But this worship of children does seem to be bordering on the perverse to me \u2013 much as I adore my own. Perhaps now that we have given up on political ideology, romance and God, children are the last place we can go where we might find some kind of religious relationship. For it seems that they have indeed become objects of our veneration. If so, they are better idols to worship than an almighty God, or Karl Marx or a passing romantic fancy. But that doesn\u2019t mean that sometimes it feels like they get spoiled rotten. That is to say, as a worshipper myself, I sometimes to lose my faith. I only hope my children will find the heartfulness and mindfulness to forgive me. @timlottwriter",
