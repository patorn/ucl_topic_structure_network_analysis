  "body": "Alejandro Mesonero, SEAT\u2019s 48-year-old director of design, likens himself to a sponge, soaking up inspiration and influences all around him. \u201cI think that\u2019s the same of anyone who works in a creative environment,\u201d explains Mesonero, \u201cnot just car designers, but artists and musicians of all kinds.\u201d    Related: From singing in the backseat to smartphone integration: in-car entertainment    In many careers as you move up the ladder you get further from the work that attracted you to the trade in the first place. This isn\u2019t so with car design. Mesonero may be the boss of design at SEAT\u2019s Martorell design studio, but he is always very much hands-on, particularly in the design of the new Ateca: drawing, advising his team of designers and rolling up his sleeves to work on clay models alongside his staff. And to take part fully in the design process, Mesonero also has to be inspired by his environment and by what\u2019s going on outside the walls of the studio.  The obvious thought is that the works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed that are synonymous with the city of Barcelona, including his masterwork the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, have been one of the major influences to be sucked up by the Mesonero sponge. \u201cYes, but really it is the whole spirit of Barcelona,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up in Madrid, a city with plenty of its own culture and particular architecture, but here in Barcelona, because it is a city by the sea, it seems to have a totally different atmosphere.  \u201cIt is to do with the people. They seem to have an enjoyment of life and contentment that seems to flow out of them, living in such an inspiring city full of variety and, of course, with a very good climate. Being surrounded by people who are happy and energetic seems to inspire creativity and the desire to make things that have style and value. \u201cAnd then of course you are right, there is the amazing architecture in Barcelona, the colours, the vibrancy. The music, too, and local art. All these elements are inspirational.\u201d     The drawings are then made into full-size clay models. Photograph: Jake Curtis for the Guardian    Mesonero studied design in Barcelona in the early 1990s before embarking upon a postgraduate degree in vehicle design at London\u2019s Royal College of Art (RCA). Dozens of the world\u2019s car designers have studied at the RCA and, like most of them, Mesonero found the atmosphere, his tutors and his fellow students inspiring. He is diplomatic about London\u2019s very un-Mediterranean climate and the effect it might have had, and whether his sponge was dampened only by rainwater. From the RCA Mesonero joined SEAT in 1995, as a designer at Martorell, where he worked on vehicles such as the SEAT Bolero concept car, a four-door coupe that never reached production itself but influenced future models, including the Leon. Two years later Mesonero moved to Audi\u2019s design centre in Sitges, less than an hour south from Barcelona on the coast, where he worked on various different SEAT, Audi and Volkswagen models. The first decade of the 2000s took him to Paris and South Korea before he arrived back in Barcelona in 2011 to take charge of design at SEAT.

Photograph: Jake Curtis for the Guardian    There are people who work in the motor industry for whom the car itself is merely a commodity. Designers, almost without exception, are the opposite \u2013 and Mesonero falls directly into the besotted camp. \u201cWalking by the sea, along the Barcelona waterfront, almost always puts ideas into my head,\u201d says Mesonero, \u201cbut nothing is as effective a catalyst as going for a drive. It is at the wheel where I can really relax and think about driving, what cars mean to us. It\u2019s while driving that many of my thoughts for the future designs of our cars come to me. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have one particular route or destination; it\u2019s simply the act of driving that does it. Mind you, we\u2019re spoilt for excellent roads in Catalonia.\u201d While it is unlikely that you will ever meet a car designer who does not have a passion for motorcars, it is also unusual to come across one who does not love the art of creating by hand. \u201cOne of my hobbies is to make model cars,\u201d says Mesonero. \u201cNot from kits \u2013 I make a sculpture of a car, then create a mould and cast the model itself. Not in brass or metal, but in a resin material.\u201d It\u2019s a process not dissimilar to creating full-size cars, which at SEAT are modelled in clay from initial drawings. SEAT clearly gets very good value from this member of staff who can\u2019t stop himself creating designs when the bell goes at the end of the day. But Mesonero has a new passion that doesn\u2019t involve cars. \u201cI\u2019ve just bought myself a wonderful 1956 Raleigh bicycle that I\u2019m doing up. Not restoring, because I don\u2019t want it to be perfect, just getting into nice usable condition but without taking away the patina of the past 60 years.\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine Alejandro Mesonero pedalling gently along the Barcelona waterfront on his vintage British bicycle on a sunny evening, drawing in the atmosphere while watching the locals relaxing. It could end simply with a glass of wine in a harbourside bar \u2013 or perhaps on that ride he will have seen something, even subconsciously, that will inspire one of his next car designs.",
