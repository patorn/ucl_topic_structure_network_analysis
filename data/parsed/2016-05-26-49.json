Three new teams, backed by AFL clubs Collingwood and Greater Western Sydney and NRL side, Melbourne Storm, will be added to the five Australian sides in the existing trans-Tasman netball league, which will shed its New Zealand teams in a major overhaul.   Related: Netball Australia announce league with three new teams and five-year TV deal    Netball Australia chief executive Kate Palmer refused to rule out significant changes to the competition\u2019s rules, but said they hadn\u2019t been discussed during the broadcast deal negotiation. \u201cWe certainly want to deliver an amazing product to the broadcasters, but any changes to the game will be Netball Australia\u2019s decision, in consultation with our eight teams and member organisations,\u201d Palmer told Guardian Australia on Friday. \u201cEvery year we look at how to improve our game. Our game has gotten to a stage where it is incredibly fast and exciting, highlighting the skill and athleticism of our athletes. This is about delivering the best sports league in the world and innovation is a key platform of every successful league.\u201d Palmer said that any move towards rule changes would be driven by a desire to create an engaging fan experience. \u201cOther sports do this very well,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cThe AFL for example, test new rules every year. That\u2019s not to say all of their test rules are implemented, however they continue to evolve their game for fans. Netball Australia will not be making rule changes for the sake of it. We\u2019ll be looking at how to improve the fan experience and quality of the game.\u201d Palmer also confirmed that the much-discussed two-point scoring zone had been discussed, but that \u201cno decisions have been made\u201d regarding its implementation. \u201cWe recognise that the idea of this rule in particular has caused controversy amongst the netball community. All potential changes will be carefully considered, with consultation,\u201d Palmer said. At the announcement of the new league last week, the Netball Australia boss had said they she \u201cwon\u2019t be making rule changes that are just for the sake of changes.\u201d  The new league and broadcast deal are seen as major steps towards the sport becoming fully professional. Geitz has praised the move, saying it will be \u201cwonderful for little girls that want to play netball for their country\u201d to see the professional game in primetime free-to-air television slots. But Geitz \u2013 who led the Queensland Firebirds to ANZ Championship glory last season and skippered the Diamonds to victory at last year\u2019s Netball World Cup and is the country\u2019s most high-profile netballer \u2013 says the game doesn\u2019t need change for change\u2019s sake. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a great product. I don\u2019t think we need to change it in any way. We love our game,\u201d Geitz says. \u201cI\u2019ve only been exposed to (the different scoring zones) in one game, in a pre-season competition, and I couldn\u2019t get my head around it. I was so confused. It changed how the game flowed. It changes the whole concept of the game, the entire way you play,\u201d she says. Netball already has a quality product, as evidenced by the landmark broadcast deal, Geitz says. \u201cOur game is fast and exciting and our athletes are extraordinarily skilful. I don\u2019t think we have any issue with the entertainment factor.\u201d The Australian captain says adding different scoring zones would fundamentally alter the game, particularly at either end of the court. \u201cAs a defender, you try to push your player as far away as possible from the post, but that (a scoring zone) would mean you\u2019d be wanting to push them closer to the post \u2026 that changes the game,\u201d she says. Any radical change would have to be managed carefully, Geitz says. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at something that will take players a long time to nail. I think players would have to be exposed to it much more than what we have been,\u201d she says. Geitz admitted that teammates who have played with scoring zones \u2013 used in the experimental Fast5 series and pre-season competitions \u2013 are positive about them. \u201cThose that have played it think it\u2019s the greatest thing ever and of course our players are adaptable, so it\u2019s a really interesting situation. I think we need more exposure to it, to fully understand it,\u201d she says. Nine\u2019s managing director, Amanda Laing, told the Sydney Morning Herald last week the \u201cevolution of the game\u201d was up to Netball Australia. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t come with a list of things that want change at all,\u201d said Laing.",
