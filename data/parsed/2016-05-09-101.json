According to data from market analysts Kantar Worldpanel, nearly 80 years after it first hit the shelves in this country, we\u2019re falling out of love with the ready-wrapped loaf \u2013 sales are down by 50m units over the last 12 months, despite the fact that it has never been cheaper. Bread is often at the frontline of price cuts as retailers attempt to lure customers back with discounted basics. But although the average price of a loaf dropped from 98p to 90p in 2015, it seems that is just not enough to tempt us back. Sales had been in slow decline for decades, but it was the Atkins diet, a radical weightloss plan based on a low-carb regime, whose popularity peaked in Britain in the early noughties, that sent them into freefall. It didn\u2019t take long for most of us to tire of Atkins\u2019s daily fry-ups, but it has been harder for bread to shake off its tarnished image, especially given the recent epidemic of gluten intolerance and carbohydrate hatred. Gwyneth Paltrow and family avoid \u201cpasta, bread and processed grains\u201d, while fashionable healthy-eating duo the Hemsley sisters reject all grains on the basis that they \u201coffer little goodness compared to other nutrient-rich options\u201d such as vegetables, nuts and seeds. Even normal people are cutting back \u2013 as a teenager, I ate bread at every meal, and regularly put away seven pieces of white sliced at morning break. Yet, despite loving avocado on toast as much as the next Guardian reader, these days I try to keep bread as an occasional treat rather than a daily ritual.     Fewer sarnies mean fewer loaves sold.

Though the lunchtime sandwich sector remains buoyant, research published in trade magazine the Grocer last year found that four in 10 of us are turning away from the traditional sliced loaf in favour of alternative breads such as wraps and pittas, while nearly 15% have cut baked goods out of the equation altogether in favour of salads, sushi and other so-called healthier options. The introduction of free school meals for infants, which has led to a 14% decline in children taking packed lunches to school, must also have played its part. Indeed, the biggest fall in wrapped bread consumption, according to Kantar analyst Kathryn Brown, has been at lunchtime, something the Grocer puts down to changing tastes as well as dietary fads. \u201cThere are a number of factors at play here,\u201d says Brown. \u201cBread is falling from favour as growing numbers of Brits dodge carbs on health grounds. What\u2019s more, in the past few years more have been opting to pick up food on the go, rather than packing lunch in the morning. Fewer sarnies, of course, mean fewer loaves sold.\u201d But reports of \u201cthe death of the packed lunch\u201d are, as Mark Twain would have it, an exaggeration. In fact, former colleagues Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing, who came up with the idea for their Little Book of Lunch thanks to a shared belief that \u201cthe lunch hour should be something greater than a shop-bought sandwich bolted down while hunched over your keyboard\u201d, reckon that the decline in sliced bread sales might well be down to our increasingly adventurous palates. \u201cIf you buy a loaf of sliced bread, you\u2019re committing to making a few sandwiches a week \u2013 or eating loads of toast. Unless you\u2019re really into routine, or see food as a purely functional thing, that can feel a bit dull. For many people, variety is key to staying interested in what they\u2019re eating. In terms of packed lunch, that might mean chucking some leftovers from last night\u2019s dinner into a Tupperware one day and stuffing some salad into a pitta the next \u2013 which is, let\u2019s face it, a sandwich by another name,\u201d Missing says. \u201cThe packed lunch isn\u2019t dying,\u201d she concludes. \u201cWho can afford to buy lunch to go every day? People are just choosing to eat different things.\u201d Craig suggests that the change might also be down to our rejection of sliced white. \u201cI stopped buying supermarket loaves about two years ago; I would much rather pick up a loaf on a weekend from a market. It\u2019s more pricey, but many of us would rather eat the good stuff less frequently than the average stuff all the time.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Andrew Whitley, the co-founder of the Real Bread Campaign and author of the book Bread Matters, agrees, arguing that it is not clear that the decline in sales of industrial loaves is down to the rising popularity of \u201chealthier\u201d convenience foods. He points out that the UK sandwich market, \u201ca major user of sliced bread\u201d, is up 6% this year. More likely, Whitley says, is that people are increasingly waking up to the \u201chidden additives and limited fermentation time that are key to cheap bread production\u201d, and are either seeking out \u201cproperly fermented, additive-free alternatives\u201d, or giving up bread altogether. The real story here, he claims, is that \u201cmore and more of us want real bread, and that no amount of price-cutting will rescue a product that has long outlived its usefulness\u201d. The truth is that competitively priced, conveniently cut and suspiciously long-lived packaged bread will always have its place in the market. For food lovers, however, the resurgence of decent alternatives is definitely the best thing since sliced sourdough. Fed up with your sandwich? Three quick and easy alternatives to egg mayonnaise     Couscous salad. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images/Westend61    Soak 50g couscous in 100ml boiling water for 10 minutes. Fluff up with a fork and stir through a good dash of extra-virgin olive oil, the juice of half a lemon, two tablespoons of cooked chickpeas, a generous handful of finely chopped coriander or flat-leaf parsley, a few quartered cherry tomatoes or chopped cucumber and some chunks of feta or flaked roast chicken. Season with salt and a pinch of chilli flakes. Blanch 50g broad beans and 25g peas in boiling water for two minutes, then plunge into iced water. When cool, drain well and stir in two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, the grated zest and juice of half a lemon, a few chopped chives and half a courgette, cut into thin ribbons. Top with crumbled goat\u2019s cheese. Line a large tortilla with leftover barbecued chicken or steak, half an avocado mashed with a little lime juice and salt, a few spoonfuls of drained black or pinto beans and some finely sliced red onion that has been soaked in cold water for 10 minutes before use. Top with a little chilli sauce, then roll up tightly and wrap in foil. What are you having for lunch? Sharon Newland, 50, social worker      I\u2019m eating a tuna salad from Pret a Manger. I\u2019ve been eating salads a lot recently as I am trying to lose weight. In summer, it\u2019s a lot easier to stick to healthier eating as it\u2019s hotter. I like sandwiches, and it\u2019s hard to avoid bread as I love it a lot. Many people seem to be avoiding bread and wheat for dietary reasons nowadays. I\u2019m sure sandwiches are still popular in some places \u2013 it\u2019s all interlinked with your class and your work environment. Clemence Smith, 31, digital marketing executive      I\u2019m eating sushi, which I like to do every Monday. I tend to bring a packed lunch, usually a salad or something with rice most days. I don\u2019t eat sandwiches because I\u2019m French \u2013 it\u2019s quite a British thing to do. I prefer a big homemade lunch and a lighter dinner. I see a lot of male colleagues eating a lunch of sandwiches with crisps, but not women. Linda Wohlgeoth, 27, marketing executive      I\u2019m having some crab rice with salad and eggs from [London healthy takeaway chain] Abokado. I eat sandwiches maybe once a week; it\u2019s a bit boring. It\u2019s quite heavy, so I\u2019m more into salads and fresh stuff. I feel a bit tired after eating a sandwich; it\u2019s quite filling. This helps me stay awake. Avoiding sandwiches isn\u2019t something I would do on purpose, it\u2019s just something that happens. I\u2019d still have sandwiches if I needed something really quick. Mirion Taforiry, 28, digital analyst      I\u2019m eating a beetroot salad that I made at home; I usually bring my own lunch. I don\u2019t tend to eat sandwiches. Sandwiches are easy to make, but I see a lot of people making other choices and getting more creative. It might be a trend due to health, but also aspiration. Ed Goodwin, 32, quantity surveyor      There aren\u2019t many places around here that sell sandwiches. This wrap is easier to eat, I think. I haven\u2019t had a sandwich for a long time, to be honest. Things like this just became more prevalent in the market, and now everybody seems to get a wrap or something like that. Cheryl Hardman, 30, council officer      I\u2019m eating a quinoa salad from Pret a Manger. I never really eat sandwiches and I\u2019m not surprised people are eating them less, as they\u2019re easy to get bored of. It\u2019s much better to have variation when you\u2019re working every day. A lot of people are too busy to even make sandwiches, and there\u2019s a lot more on offer in the shops these days. Frank Lopez, 35, visual merchandiser      I\u2019m eating a pasta salad with some bread. It\u2019s low in calories and it\u2019s healthy. It\u2019s not really heavy. I usually have salads for lunch because they\u2019re quite light. I think about health issues: this has fibre, it\u2019s got olive oil for the skin, it\u2019s got cheese for calcium, a few vegetables inside. I run a lot. I need my fibre. Charlotte Lucas, 24, visual merchandiser      I\u2019m eating a ham hock salad from Waitrose. I\u2019m trying to be healthy. I never make my own lunch as I\u2019m lazy, but if I did, it wouldn\u2019t be sandwiches. I don\u2019t tend to eat bread as it bloats me. I\u2019m seeing a lot of people around me avoid bread \u2013 it\u2019s not really associated with health these days. Interviews by Sara Ilyas and Tom Nicholson",
