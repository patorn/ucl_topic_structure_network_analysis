  "body": "Yeah, it\u2019s number three. The third roll of the dice,\u201d Fran Halsall says, a typical burst of laughter erupting from the swimmer as she counts off her trio of Olympic Games, stretching from Beijing in 2008 to London four years later to Rio just over two months from now. Three might be her lucky number for, after an Olympic debut as a naive teenager and her disappointment at London 2012 where she failed to win any of the five medals she was chasing, Halsall seems confident she can strike gold in the 50m freestyle this summer. \u201cI decided not to swim the 100m as well,\u201d the 26-year-old says as she explains why she has jettisoned her wildly ambitious approach at London 2012. \u201cIf I did both I could do them well. But if I focus on just the one I could do really, really well. So it was a question of being greedy or putting all my eggs in the 50m basket, where I\u2019m stronger. I\u2019ve decided to put all my work into that and aim for gold. If I did the 100m first it could jeopardise gold in the 50m. My target is to win a gold medal at the Olympics, so I need to give myself the best opportunity to do that.\u201d Three is, again, the operative number because this month the versatile Halsall won a hat-trick of gold medals at the European championships in London, including victory in the 50m backstroke, and a bronze in the 50m butterfly. But it is more important that, as she points out in her focused approach to Rio, \u201cI\u2019ve swum the third fastest time in the world this year in the 50m free\u201d.   Related: Fran Halsall eager to dive in on way to Olympic redemption at Rio Games    Halsall, in her relaxed way, lists her main rivals without sounding frightened of any of them. \u201cOf course we\u2019ve got the Campbell sisters [Cate and Bronte] from Australia who I raced against at the Commonwealth Games, and there is Ranomi Kromowidjojo, the defending Olympic champion [in the 50m and 100m]. Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m [the Swedish sprinter who also won three gold medals at the European championships] as well. But I\u2019ve got my race process written down. Even 50m can get broken up into a hundred bits, funnily enough, so I know exactly what I need to do in each section. If I hit my targets, I\u2019m going to be very competitive in Rio.\u201d It helps that Halsall defeated the Campbell sisters when winning 2014 Commonwealth gold in a searing 50m sprint in Glasgow. \u201cThat gives me confidence. The fact that I swam my best time in the biggest competition of the year in the middle lane against some stiff competition shows I can do it when it really matters. It was the fastest ever 50m final outside of the super suits [the hi-tech suits made from plastic derivatives which were banned in 2010]. So that gives me belief. If I get my preparation right, I\u2019ve got as good a chance as anyone in Rio.\u201d Halsall is a breeze to interview at the launch of Arena\u2019s Powerskin Carbon\u2011Ultra swimwear at the London Aquatics Centre. She is open and funny and very chatty. Yet, despite her charm, it often seems as if residual doubts are not brushed away easily by Halsall. She endured a customary blip at the British trials last month when she easily won the 50m freestyle but her time of 24.48 was 0.09sec outside the Rio qualification standard. Halsall looked devastated as she climbed out of the Glasgow pool and lamented: \u201cIt\u2019s just not good enough.\u201d Her place in the Olympic squad could not be assured and it seems strange that a genuine contender in Rio could have allowed this situation to emerge. \u201cWhat I wanted more than anything was a consistent block of training and I was so proud I\u2019d done that before the trials.\u201d Halsall says. \u201cI had swum really fast at a meet in Marseille. I went 24.2 \u2013 putting me third in the world this year. But I put too much pressure on myself in Glasgow. I was thinking: \u2018I should be able to get the time but what happens if I don\u2019t? There\u2019s not much competition so it\u2019s me against myself. It\u2019s like a training swim.\u2019 All this is going on in my head and it\u2019s typical of me when I am swimming outside a major competition. I don\u2019t have these problems at the Europeans or Olympics.\u201d   Related: Fran Halsall: 'I may never get over the disappointment of London 2012'    As soon as her hand touched the wall in Glasgow did she guess she was in trouble? \u201cYeah. I knew because I had a ropey start. I was a tenth of a second slower off the blocks than I should have been and for a sprinter that\u2019s massive. But my time would have seen me come fourth at the world championships last year so it wasn\u2019t that bad. I was just annoyed because I\u2019d already swum faster this season. I thought: \u2018For God\u2019s sake, what is up with me?\u2019\u201d Was she given any comfort from the selectors that they would pick her anyway for Rio? Halsall shakes her head. \u201cBut my coach [James Gibson] said: \u2018There\u2019s leeway for anyone who swims within 2% of the qualifying time \u2026 and you\u2019ve done that.\u2019 I was like: \u2018OK, phew, I should be going.\u2019 But as the week went on I thought: \u2018What if they don\u2019t pick me?\u2019 So when I rang my parents on the Thursday, after the squad was announced, I got all emotional.\u201d Halsall breaks into an amusingly hysterical voice: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to the Olympics\u00a0\u2026\u2019\u201d How did she hear the news? \u201cWe were told an email would be sent on the Thursday morning, before it became public. I didn\u2019t get it for ages \u2013 because it went into my junk. I didn\u2019t even know it had arrived. Typical!\u201d Halsall hoots with laughter again before she explains her new calm. \u201cFrom last September to the trials my buzzword was consistency because the year before I was injured a lot. I was, like, \u2018Right, I don\u2019t want to get ill or injured.\u2019 And the physio said to me: \u2018Fran, in the eight years I\u2019ve known you this is the least I\u2019ve seen you these past few months. What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yes!\u2019 \u201cI just want to stand on the blocks in Rio and say: \u2018If someone beats me, or if I win, I know there\u2019s nothing more I could have done.\u2019 Experience is a big thing in sprinting and I\u2019ve got a lot stronger in the last four years. I know how to race a lot better now. \u201cI\u2019m lucky I\u2019m in an event where it\u2019s more about fine\u2011tuning and making sure your body is fresh and you\u2019ve got all your fast-twitch muscles firing \u2013 rather than slogging up and down for 80,000 metres a week. That\u2019s why sprinters have so much more longevity.\u201d     Fran Halsall with her bronze medal after coming third in the 50m butterfly at the European championships in London this month. Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images    That experience has helped her. \u201cMy head might tell me: \u2018Oh, you feel crap because you didn\u2019t sleep well last night. What are you going to do?\u2019 But I know now to tell myself to relax because I\u2019ve done the work. I can also say: \u2018There\u2019ve been loads of times where you\u2019ve felt worse than this and you\u2019ve swum well.\u2019 I\u2019ve been working on my mind because my motivation in training used to dip and I\u2019d say: \u2018This is boring.\u2019 Now I think: \u2018Right, I\u2019ve just got to get it done. I might not like it today but if I do it well it\u2019s going to help my end result.\u2019 I\u2019ve been working with Rich [the sports psychologist Richard Hampson], who used to be with Andy Murray and the canoeists and now he\u2019s with British Swimming. I see him almost every week. When he asks, \u2018What do you want out of this year?\u2019, I say: \u2018I want to enjoy it and achieve my dream of winning an Olympic medal.\u2019 We make sure I\u2019m ticking along towards those goals.\u201d Halsall was earmarked as one of the potential home stars of London 2012 but she was consumed by expectation and too many races. Her route to Rio will be more low-key. \u201cIt\u2019s an eight-day meet and I\u2019m swimming on days seven and eight. I can fly in later, chill out and not get caught up in everything at the beginning of the week. I will arrive about four days before I swim \u2013 and hopefully I can finish it off nicely for the team with a gold.\u201d Before her third Olympics, Halsall has become more reflective. \u201cThe good years always go quicker, don\u2019t they? The ones that are a bit of a struggle drag more. But I have lots of memories and good experiences. I can put the others in a box and bury them deeper. The main thing is I still enjoy swimming now as much as I when I was 17. I\u2019m doing a job that I love. I see the world, go for a swim, have a nap, walk my dog. It\u2019s not a bad lifestyle.\u201d Halsall has also been watching a lot more rugby league over the past 18 months \u2013 which is the length of time she has been going out with Jon Wilkin, the St Helens captain. \u201cI met Jon at Sports Personality of the Year in 2014 and we got chatting and it turns out that one of my great-grandmas was on the board of directors at St Helens. So it\u2019s a bit weird. \u201cI am from Southport so I should be a supporter of St Helens. But I\u2019ve been living in Loughborough for eight years so I\u2019ve become a Leicester Tigers fan. My brother always told me: \u2018No, Fran, rugby league is much better \u2013 you should really watch it.\u2019 So I\u2019m going to as many games as I can and I\u2019m getting it now. I just hate seeing the hits. Jon got knocked out the other week but my mum took it worse. She rang me, crying: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s not going to get up, this is awful!\u2019 I was like: \u2018Mum, chill out, it\u2019s his job. He\u2019s just got to get on with it.\u2019\u201d The Halsall laugh explodes again \u2013 as it does when she explains that Wilkin hopes to see her swim in Rio. \u201cBut he\u2019s got to ask Keiron Cunningham [the Saints coach] if he can come out for the weekend. I don\u2019t know whether he will be allowed.\u201d She expects there will be other opportunities for Wilkin to see her swim in the Olympics. \u201cAfter Rio the plan is I\u2019m going to move back up north and move in with Jon. I\u2019ll train up there and if my body can still do it there\u2019s no reason why I shouldn\u2019t go to Tokyo in 2020. It would be nice to do four Olympics. How many did Mark Foster do? Five? I need to get on a par with him. Let\u2019s not forget Dara Torres was 40 when she won a medal in 2008\u00a0\u2026\u201d Halsall has a British lion tattooed on her foot and has long planned on adding the Olympic rings in inky tribute on her skin. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it,\u201d she promises with a last throaty chuckle, \u201cbut only if I win that Olympic medal. It would be good to make it gold before I get that tattoo.\u201d",
