  "body": "In early 2008, for quixotic reasons that needn\u2019t detain us here, I decided to walk from Dubai airport across the city and into the Empty Quarter of Arabia. Prior to departure, at home in London, I tried to figure out a way of reaching, on foot, the desert resort of Bab al Shams, which lay about 15 miles beyond the city\u2019s ragged fringe of buy-to-let building sites. There were some tourist maps that showed the downtown area and a few primary arterial routes, but there was nothing available that had both the necessary scale for a walker \u2013 1:25,000 or better \u2013 and sufficiently accurate orientation to enable compass bearings. While the local Bedouin may to this day retain a mental map of the area, collating a myriad of little positional markers \u2013 environmental, solar and sidereal \u2013 in order to determine location and direction, everyone else presumably relied on the GPS navigation systems in their air-conditioned cars. In the end I hit on the simple if deranging idea of laying a 12in ruler against a Google Earth satellite photograph of the desert on my computer screen. This did indeed give me a means of dead-reckoning, but I had no way of determining distance accurately, and when I left the last pile of dusty breezeblocks behind and headed into the dunes, following the flickering needle of my compass, it was with the understanding I might well be spending the night beneath the stars. In fact, the bearing proved sound enough, and I arrived at the resort hotel well after dark to be informed by the receptionist (who was from Selly Oak) that there\u2019d be no alcohol served that night because it was the Prophet\u2019s birthday. It struck me then that my way-finding method was world-girdlingly ironic: when Wilfred Thesiger rode his camel this way in the late 1920s, he was the first person to undertake a systematic survey \u2013 before that, to the western eye at least, this Quarter was indeed a void. Now, less than a century later, the great sable expanse was once more sliding into a sort of zone of ignorance \u2013 a terra incognita defined not by our ignorance concerning its location or extent, but by the very technologies that allow us to traverse it with great accuracy and at speed. The first iPhone equipped with GPS tracking and mapping was also released in early 2008, so had I been a little less of a wannabe Bedouin, I could have gone equipped, and as long as I discovered shade to see what was on the screen, followed the little-blue-dot-that-was-me into the wide blue yonder. My hypothetical iPhone would have also had to have sent signals to and received them from at least four of the GPS satellites currently in orbit around the Earth; these satellites are in communication with each other, and it is this spatio-temporal triangulation that enables anyone with a smartphone, more on less anywhere on Earth, to know where they are and where they are headed. There are now 32 satellites in orbit \u2013 the original plan was for 24 \u2013 and in the 35 very odd years since the system booted-up, their impact on more or less every aspect of our lives has been incalculable. We may associate GPS mostly with the warm tones giving us turn-by-turn driving directions, but the amount of critical infrastructure that now depends on the system means that were it to go down, civilisation as we know it would very likely collapse. Greg Milner\u2019s Pinpoint tells the story of how we were navigated into this situation \u2212 conventional methods of dating place us in the 2016th year of the Common Era, but for him the clock really began ticking (if oscillating caesium atoms do, in fact, tick) at midnight on 5 January 1980 when \u2212 synchronised to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time, as determined by an averaging of more than 200 atomic clocks worldwide) \u2212 the GPS system went live. But where did it come from, this notion of a network of satellites delineating a pure, mathematically definable and Cartesian space? Milner\u2019s answer is unequivocal: \u201cWhen an Isis terrorist gets a GPS reading, the process is enabled by the United States military, which presides over every GPS calculation.\u201d In common with almost all of the amazing technological innovations that have characterised the past half-century, GPS owes its inception to the Pentagon\u2019s strategic imperatives. The indiscriminate carpet-bombing of Japan and Germany in the second world war was seen to be inefficient as well as inhumane, and the drive in the years following was to create a targeting technology so accurate it could \u201cput five bombs in the same hole\u201d. There was this driver, and there was also a pressing need for a means of intercepting Soviet ballistic missiles, as well as ensuring the US\u2019s missiles reached their targets. The first prototypes of GPS targeting systems were in use as early as the Vietnam war, but it was the Gulf war that really saw their wide-scale military adoption. The US defence department continues to oversee the system \u2013 maintenance costs about a billion a year \u2013 but day-to-day running is handled by the air force, while the 16 monitoring stations that ensure the satellite array does its job are under the control of the National Security Agency (NSA). Given, as Milner writes, that \u201cGPS is an essential part of virtually every weapons system\u201d, while the spooks have been involved with its development every precisely calibrated inch of the way, you don\u2019t have to be a paranoid conspiracy theorist to feel concerned about our dependency on it. Nor do you have to be a desert walker in order to apprehend the impact of GPS on your personal orientation and wayfinding: everyone reading this has probably had the experience of getting lost while, paradoxically, being informed of precisely where you are. GPS navigation seems to leech us of all the \u201cthick data\u201d of being in place \u2013 our sensory apprehensions, including visual, sonic and haptic cues \u2212 even as it gifts us such phenomenally accurate directions. Milner ventures a short way into the impact of the technology on our cognitive function, and even essays a few remarks on the philosophic conundrums it raises, but these issues are better dealt with in Nicholas Carr\u2019s account of the risks of automation, The Glass Cage, whereas the bulk of this book is a fairly nerdy account of the backroom whiz-kids who figured out the nuts and bolts of the system. I found Milner\u2019s account of the infighting between Pentagon and its various contractors interesting enough, just as I enjoyed his dissection of the phenomenon of \u201cdeath by GPS\u201d (in, say, desert valleys, where drivers using a satnav get lost). Milner also delves deep into the dense web of intersections between GPS \u2013 \u201cthe world\u2019s only free utility\u201d \u2013 and all those other utilities we vitally depend on, with interesting side excursions into earthquake-detection and the GPS-assisted monitoring of offenders. But I cavilled at his view that \u201cGPS reflects a choice, a conscious application of a neutral technology\u201d. Surely no technology is \u201cneutral\u201d \u2013 each bears the impress of the impetus for its development. Milner writes that: \u201cGPS itself is a blank slate on to which we project our desires. And what we desire most from it is perfect knowledge of other people\u2019s location and behaviour.\u201d A benign view of this desire is Marshall McLuhan\u2019s conception of \u201cthe global village\u201d; a rather more negative one is Jeremy Bentham\u2019s panopticon: a prison whose inmates are continuously surveilled by their jailers. A still more negative one is surely the truth: this was a technology developed in order to have perfect knowledge of other people\u2019s location and behaviour, so that they could be killed, all the other stuff is simply a rather more useful spin-off. Milner examines in some detail etak, the Polynesians\u2019 traditional navigation method, which was supplanted by western systems \u2013 whether maps or GPS \u2013 that place the individual subject at their centre. Practitioners of etak relied on a combination of very thick perceptual data, and an intuitive grasp of the relational movement between two fixed points and a third moving one (a parallax view); and it was this that enabled their astonishing diaspora. That one of these fixed points might well be an island the navigator had never actually visited teases out the enormous conceptual gulf between our worldview and theirs: whether we are laying rulers across computer screens, checking the time on our phone or using that phone to make a call, we are employing a technology that, as Milner puts it, \u201cprovides the possibility of omniscience\u201d. No wonder some of us develop the delusion that we are gods; a cosmic solecism no Polynesian \u2013 or Bedouin, for that matter \u2013 was ever guilty of. \u2022 Pinpoint is published by WW Norton in the US and by Granta in the UK in July.
