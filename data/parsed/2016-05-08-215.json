  "body": "When Yuko Shimizu moved to New York in 1999 she had no interest in \u2013 or money for \u2013 interiors. \u201cI rented an apartment in an unhip area of Brooklyn and bought all the used Ikea furniture from the guy moving out,\u201d she says. But when she came to buy her own place eight years ago, viewing more than 100 apartments changed her thinking. \u201cI realised that decorating your home is part of your personality.\u201d From her interior choices, you might guess she is comfortable with risk. Early 20th-century wooden wall panels are painted solid black and topped with graphic wallpaper. A narrow hallway is covered in bold monochrome stripes that extend from the walls across the ceiling. A modernist Barcelona chair sits next to a Versailles-style dome seat. These things could easily not have worked. Shimizu herself took a leap of faith in her mid-30s when she ditched a corporate PR job in Japan for art school in New York. The risk paid off and she\u2019s now, at an undisclosed age, a respected illustrator. She\u2019s also keen to point out that she\u2019s not to be confused with the other Yuko Shimizu who created Hello Kitty.     Lines of enquiry: the neat and compact kitchen. Photograph: Mark Seelen. Styling: Marc Heldens    When Shimizu found her third-floor, one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, she approached decorating as she does her work. \u201cLooking at the apartment I realised, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s like a three-dimensional space you fill in,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMy drawings are not simple. They\u2019re highly decorative, but they have rhythm \u2013 parts where it\u2019s tight and parts where you let go.\u201d And so she set to work. For the main areas of her home she chose a palette of black and white with an accent colour of red. \u201cThe tone is important,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Asia there\u2019s a Chinese red that is cooler with a lot more black, and a Japanese red that shifts more towards orange. I like both but, for interiors, the Japanese red brightens a room.\u201d Indeed, red continually beams out against the black and white throughout her home: from the artwork to her bedroom door, and the lettering on a cushion that says \u201cBE NICE OR LEAVE.\u201d (\u201cI sometimes give these as presents because people love them,\u201d she says.) Most notably, it\u2019s the base colour of the wallpaper in her lounge \u2013 a depiction of galloping zebras and flying arrows. Originally designed for a New York restaurant, this is a cult print spotted in Wes Anderson\u2019s The Royal Tenenbaums, covering the walls of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s character\u2019s room. The flow of the animals creates the feel of a fairground carousel circling overhead.     Colour co-ordinated: Yuko Shimizu outside her apartment with her chihuahua \u2018Bruiser\u2019.

Styling: Marc Heldens    When it comes to furniture, Shimizu decided to challenge herself to a \u201cNo Ikea rule.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard because they have some great stuff,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the problem is, whichever country you go to, everyone has the same furniture and it feels wrong.\u201d So she tries to buy original items, either on Etsy and eBay, or when she travels. She is a collector of both \u201cjunk and expensive things\u201d \u2013 from figurines of Chinese dictators to Fornasetti pieces. \u201cI like to support artists,\u201d she says, \u201cand often that means I can\u2019t immediately buy the thing I want [because it\u2019s too expensive], but that\u2019s OK. One day I might be able to.\u201d While others might admire Shimizu\u2019s choices, committing them to a living space requires courage. Does she enjoy the risk of things potentially not working? \u201cI guess that\u2019s what artists are, right? If your vision and viewpoint is the same as everyone else\u2019s, you\u2019re probably not doing art,\u201d she says. \u201cYour home is your space and is where you can take risks. It\u2019s a bit like my work,\u201d she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t need everyone to love it.\u201d Living With Yuko Shimizu is published by Roads, \u00a311.99.
