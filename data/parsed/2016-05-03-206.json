  "body": "The government will pay businesses to take on young unemployed people as interns in a new deal where they receive $200 extra on top of their fortnightly welfare payments. The Coalition has stepped back from Tony Abbott\u2019s work-for-the-dole program in favour of a scheme called Youth Jobs PaTH. The government will save $494.2m over four years by requiring the \u201cmost job ready\u201d unemployed people to work for the dole after 12 months, instead of six months. It will redirect $751.7m to Youth Jobs PaTH, which will pay employers $1,000 to take on a young person who has been unemployed for more than six months as an intern for four to 12 weeks. The unemployed person will get an extra $200 a fortnight on top of their welfare payments for the work, which the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said was \u201creal work for the dole\u201d.   Related: Work for the dole scheme accused of discriminating against Indigenous Australians    \u201cIt is not often the treasurer comes from being social services minister to treasurer; I have seen the liability on the country of a young unemployed person,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are making sure they have choices.\u201d Businesses that employ people full-time at the end of their internships will be eligible for a youth bonus wage subsidy of between $6,500 and $10,000. \u201cThese subsidies are just a smarter way of leveraging what you\u2019d otherwise spend on Newstart and other welfare payments,\u201d he said. The program will offer job training of up to six weeks from 1 April 2017. The first three weeks of training will focus on \u201cworking in a team\u201d, IT literacy and presentation. \u201cAustralian businesses, especially small businesses, have told me they want to give young people a go but we need to do more to get alongside them to help them to develop the confidence, skills, attitudes and behaviours that are expected by employers so they can get a job and stay in a job, because that is what they want,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a two-way street. Young people have told me how they need people to get alongside them to help them develop the confidence, skills, attitudes and behaviours that are expected by employers so they can get a job and stay in a job, because that is what they want.\u201d Morrison said up to 12% of Australians were growing up in \u201cjobless families\u201d. The government will also provide an extra $88.6m over four years to the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and to support self-employment opportunities for young people. The changes will include workshops to help people \u201cexplore self-employment as a pathway\u201d according to the budget papers, and starter packs to raise awareness of assistance available to young people who want to self-employ. The number of places in the incentive scheme will increase to 8,600 from 1 December 2016.",
