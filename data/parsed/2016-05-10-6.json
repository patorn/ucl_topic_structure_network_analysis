The figures from the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) show that, by 2015, the number of people internally displaced by conflict \u2013 40.8 million \u2013 was double the total number of refugees.  Violence displaced 8.6 million more people last year \u2013 24,000 each day, on average \u2013 making it a record year for conflict-driven displacement. Even more people were displaced by natural disasters, which forced 19.2 million people in 113 countries out of their homes \u2013 more than twice the number made homeless by conflict. Although most left because of extreme weather such as storms and flooding, the Nepalese earthquake in April last year prompted 2.6 million people to flee. Over the past eight years, a total of 203.4 million people have been displaced due to disasters.   Disaster displacements   Three Middle Eastern countries accounted for more than half the new conflict displacements: Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Ukraine, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan had the highest numbers of new IDPs.    8.6 million new displacements associated with conflict and violence in 28 countries in 2015   Five of the 10 countries with the highest number of conflict-driven IDPs \u2013 Colombia, DRC, Iraq, Sudan and, since independence in 2011, South Sudan \u2013 have appeared in the IDMC\u2019s list every year since 2003. Preliminary estimates suggest at least 1 million people were forcibly displaced by criminal violence in Mexico and Central America, while tens of millions more were uprooted across the world by development projects such as dams, urban renewal programmes and sporting events. Such people, according to the report, are all too often ignored or overlooked because they tend to exist \u201coff the grid\u201d. Alexandra Bilak, the director of the IDMC, said the report was intended to illustrate the many challenges posed by the global internal displacement crisis. \u201cIt also highlights the glaring absence of political solutions to address displacement, and constitutes an important wake-up call to national governments and global policymakers alike,\u201d she said. Without sufficient action, she added, IDP emergencies \u2013 such as those in Colombia and DRC \u2013 \u201cdrag on for years and even decades\u201d. The report comes almost a year after the UN estimated that 59.5m people were refugees, internally displaced or seeking asylum by the end of 2014. By the reckoning of the UN\u2019s refugee agency, UNHCR, one in every 122 people on the planet is displaced by war, violence and persecution.   Related: How do we make life better for people living as refugees for generations? | Laurie Lee    Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said that while the plight of the world\u2019s 19.5 million refugees is firmly on the political and media agenda because of the European refugee crisis, its IDP population is often forgotten. Egeland said refugee numbers represented only the tip of the displacement iceberg, adding that 6.6 million people have been displaced within Syria alone. \u201cLarge crises such as Syria should lead to a new and more holistic thinking about displacement,\u201d he said.  \u201cA similar shift is needed in analysing the causes and consequences of displacement. We tend to think in terms of single, isolated triggers, but the reality is far more complex.\u201d With the number of IDPs rising worldwide, said Egeland, the international community needed to adopt a more comprehensive approach to development, resilience and governance. \u201cWhen displacement becomes inevitable, humanitarians attend to more immediate needs, but they must work with the development sector if sustainable solutions are to be achieved,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere is a clear trend of displacement becoming more protracted and more of a development challenge.\u201d",
