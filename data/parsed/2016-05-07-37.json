  "body": "Shakespeare\u2019s early histories used to be written off. Harold Bloom, in his massive book on Shakespeare, devotes a derisory seven pages to the three Henry VI plays and tells us \u201cthey do not live now\u201d. But, as RSC revivals of the complete trilogy by Michael Boyd and Terry Hands have proved, they make terrific theatre. I would guess that the first two-hour segment of the BBC version, broadcast on Saturday night, will have also kept viewers riveted to their screens, astonished that Shakespeare could outdo Game of Thrones. Condensing the trilogy into two sections, as Ben Power and Dominic Cooke have done here \u2013 and as Peter Hall and John Barton did in their 1963 Stratford production of The Wars of the Roses \u2013 inevitably means some loss. Power (the concept, not the script editor) becomes the dominant theme as the rival parties of York and Lancaster go to it. But, even in these early plays, Shakespeare offsets baronial battles with vivid glimpses of common life. At one point, Shakespeare wittily juxtaposes the Duchess of Gloucester\u2019s recourse to witchery with her husband\u2019s exposure of a fake miracle at St Alban\u2019s: no trace of that here. More crucially the Duke of Somerset, who helps start the whole conflict between the red and white roses, has in this version become the lover of Henry VI\u2019s French queen: in Shakespeare that\u2019s a privilege reserved for the Earl of Suffolk.

Probably not when Cooke directs with such sweep and when there are so many tremendous performances. Hugh Bonneville, as the Duke of Gloucester and the realm\u2019s protector, conveys with the merest lift of an eyebrow his dismay at the kingdom\u2019s descent into tribal war. Sophie Okonedo as Margaret of Anjou, arbitrarily hitched to Tom Sturridge\u2019s gauche young king, strongly registers the character\u2019s growing sense of power: she even thrusts the regal sceptre into his hands as if she alone were aware of its mystical significance. And Ben Miles \u2013 whose stage performance as Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall for many of us outshone Mark Rylance\u2019s on television \u2013 is excellent as Somerset: the intercutting of his orgasmic love-making with Henry\u2019s queen and the tortured cries of the strangled Duke of Gloucester are a good example of sharp, intelligent editing. This is a fine start to the series that takes us back to the glories of Rupert Goold\u2019s Richard II, which kicked off the BBC\u2019s Hollow Crown series in 2012: the difference is that England has now declined from a kingdom of peacock ostentation and pet monkeys into a land of wolves and tigers.",
