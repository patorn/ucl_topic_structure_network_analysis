A report produced by the Pew Charitable Trusts has highlighted the significant revenues that fishermen, processors and retailers are generating from severely depleted species of tuna. Taken together, the seven most commercially important tuna species \u2013 skipjack, albacore, bigeye, yellowfin, atlantic bluefin, Pacific bluefin and southern bluefin \u2013 generated $12bn (\u00a38bn) for fishermen in 2014, while the full value, including the total amount paid by the final consumer at supermarkets and restaurants around the world, was estimated to be $42bn (\u00a329bn). \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that tuna are big business,\u201d said Amanda Nickson, Pew\u2019s director of global tuna conservation. \u201cNow, for the first time, we\u2019re able to put an actual price on what\u2019s at stake in the fight for the conservation and sustainable management of these commercially and ecologically important fish.\u201d The report also highlights how tuna is a vital source of revenue to fishing communities, particularly Pacific Islands. The total catch in the Pacific Ocean was estimated at $22bn in 2014.  Pew says that income will be at risk unless companies and governments, particularly Japan, US and those in the EU, can agree to catch limits that allow stocks to recover. Five out of the eight tuna species are at risk of extinction due to overfishing, according to conservationists.       \u201cThe tussle at the moment is a lot to do with the fact that as the less affluent players, particularly the islands in the Pacific, realise the value of the resource they have, they will want to take a stake in that. And those who have historically fished it do not necessarily want to give that stake away.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see tuna stocks depleting because the countries involved can\u2019t agree sensibly on the management of them,\u201d said Nickson, who called for scientifically-informed catch limits to enable heavily depleted stocks, such as Pacific bluefin tuna, to recover and prevent others such as skipjack becoming overfished.     In 2014, 17,000 metric tonnes of bluefin tuna was caught with a retail value of \u00a3530m. Photograph: Pew Charitable Trust    Most of the tuna industry is currently paying \u201clip service\u201d to efforts to better manage tuna stocks, said Nickson, but she praised the steps being taken by some UK retailers and processors. Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, M&S, Morrisons and Co-op recently backed a call to cut yellowfin tuna catches in the Indian Ocean in an effort to help stocks recover. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two ways that we are going to see change in the supply chain,\u201d said Nickson. \u201cEither a regulatory process saying you can only catch this much, forcing the industry to adjust to that, or you are going to see market pressure from retailers saying we don\u2019t want to purchase from any place that can\u2019t actually demonstrate specific sustainability steps. Consumers should be able to buy tuna and not have to worry about where it is from. It is up to retailers and processors to better manage stocks.\u201d Much of the concern from conservation experts in recent years has centred on bluefin tuna stocks. Although not yet classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered (it is listed as vulnerable), Pacific bluefin tuna has seen stocks depleted to less than 3% of its historic levels. It was just under 4% in 2012. The report estimated that the 17,000 metric tonnes of pacific bluefin caught in 2014 had a final value of $770m. In comparison, the 2.8m metric tonnes of skipjack caught in 2014, not currently overfished and most often used for canned tuna, had an end final value of $17.7bn.",
