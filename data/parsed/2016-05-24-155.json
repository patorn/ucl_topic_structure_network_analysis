Related: The far right\u2019s narrow defeat in Austria should be a wake-up call for Europe | Owen Jones    \u201cWe should all pull together,\u201d Norbert Hofer said at a Freedom party (FP\u00d6) meeting in Vienna on Tuesday. \u201cThere are no signs of electoral fraud.\u201d In the immediate aftermath of the vote, FP\u00d6 leaders and activists had cried foul over the narrow result, with the Green-endorsed independent candidate Alexander Van der Bellen winning by only about 31,000 votes. Even before it emerged that Hofer had lost out on the presidency due to Van der Bellen\u2019s strong performance in the postal vote, the party\u2019s secretary, Herbert Kickl, had said that absentee votes had in the past shown up \u201cinconsistencies\u201d.     Norbert Hofer said his FP\u00d6 needed to \u2018pull together\u2019 after his narrow defeat.

On his Facebook page, the party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, seized on irregularities in Linz and Waidhofen, where the final result announced a voter turnout of 146.9%. The interior ministry said the figure was the result of a data entry error. Hofer too, whose election would have confronted the EU with a far-right president for the first time, said on Sunday night that there was \u201csomething a little bit strange in the way the postal vote is counted\u201d. The FP\u00d6, whose 49.7% in the final result represents a huge shift in Austria\u2019s political landscape, will now set its sights on the next general election, which must be held before September 2018. A poll by ATV institute published over the weekend shows the FP\u00d6 leading on 34%, ahead of the centre-left Social Democrats (SP\u00d6) on 26%, the centre-right People\u2019s party on 18% and the Greens on 13%.   Related: The Guardian view on the Austrian presidential elections: disaster narrowly averted | Editorial    The FP\u00d6 appeared to lose momentum after the resignation of the SP\u00d6 chancellor, Werner Faymann, on 9 May, shedding five points, while the SP\u00d6 gained eight percentage points under the new chancellor, Christian Kern. Van der Bellen said the outcome of the presidential election showed that the country was made up of two equally important halves, which \u201ctogether make up this beautiful Austria\u201d. The new president\u2019s conciliatory language contrasted with a statement made earlier this year, when he said that if elected president, he would not swear in a new chancellor who wanted to \u201cdestroy a united Europe\u201d, such as the FP\u00d6\u2019s Strache, and that he would consider dissolving parliament and calling for new elections instead.",
