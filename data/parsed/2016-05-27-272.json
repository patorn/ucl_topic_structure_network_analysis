Not flowers, but grim-faced Day-Glo-clad Mamils \u2013 Middle Aged Men in Lycra \u2013 panting up and down the more punishing stretches of the Berkshire downs on unbelievably expensive\u00a0bikes. Sometimes it\u2019s organised races, whole wasp-coloured packs of cyclists. But more often it\u2019s loners, either training for something or just grinding away furiously at the hills. These roads are too narrow for drivers to overtake easily, which means I spend enough time languishing at 10mph behind backsides covered by Neoprene to wonder quite what it\u2019s all about.   Related: Why I run: it's not pretty or elegant, but it's the best way to clear your head    It\u2019s not just cyclists, obviously. The begging emails with their apologetic links to Just Giving pages come thick and fast at this time of year. Half the world seems to be doing Race for Life, or Moonwalking 26 miles in a bra, or running Tough Mudders. (Who knew that crawling over obstacles, some of them electrified, in freezing mud for 12 miles would be so appealing that 2.5\u00a0million people worldwide would want to do it?) Extreme sporting challenges are now so popular that Pippa Middleton reportedly plans to make a career out of competing in them \u2013 and if you\u2019re wondering how that constitutes a job exactly, remember her last career involved solemnly giving a recipe for ice cubes. But even marathons aren\u2019t extreme enough for some. Masha Gordon is an ex-banker who climbed Everest last week in a bid to set a new female record for the Explorers Grand Slam (a dizzying combination of reaching the summit of seven mountains, plus treks to the north and south pole) and kickstart Grit & Rock, a charity using mountaineering programmes to foster grit and determination in British schoolgirls. She also happens to be an old friend, and as I followed her up the mountain via Facebook updates, the word that leaped out was \u201ccrowds\u201d. Gordon described queues of climbers waiting their turn on fixed ropes, a summit so packed with people it felt almost \u201canti-climactic\u201d. So many people queueing up to risk everything, on a mountain that sent four people to their deaths that week. Were they really exploring the mountain or actually exploring themselves, the things of which they might or might not be capable when pushed beyond\u00a0endurance? How interesting that only now, when life for westerners has never been safer or longer or physically easier, do we see the emergence of a whole new industry devoted to deliberately making it harder. All the sweat and adrenaline and danger that past generations would have encountered just making a living, only this time delivered via Iron Man contests and weekends of pretending to be in the Tour de France.     \u2018These roads are too narrow for drivers to overtake easily, which means I spend enough time languishing at 10mph behind backsides covered by Neoprene to wonder quite what it\u2019s all about.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy    But that doesn\u2019t quite explain the gentler charity 5km that so many now go in for. (And yes, guilty as charged: next week\u2019s family-friendly Rainbow Run in aid of children\u2019s hospices, since you\u2019re asking.) For charities, such mass events are a lifeline now that so many methods of fundraising are either tainted with scandal or undermined by compassion fatigue. People who dodge chuggers in the street and hang up crossly on cold callers will happily pay for the privilege of doing glorified PE. But while the cause is evidently what it\u2019s all about for some, that\u2019s not the whole story. So many runners now do the race but fail to raise a penny for the charity that organisers are increasingly setting minimum sponsorship targets to ensure they don\u2019t actually make a loss. If not for altruism then what, exactly, are we running for \u2013 or from?    If not for altruism, then what, exactly, are we running for \u2013 or from?    What\u2019s mystifying is that 20 years ago most of the people brandishing medals on my Facebook feed were probably bunking off cross-country, not volunteering for it. These are the colleagues whose idea of a race used to be getting to the bar for last orders, the mums with whom I sat around cheerfully eating cake on maternity leave. Even my Everest-climbing friend freely admits to being rubbish at PE at school, and incapable of running far without getting out of breath not so long ago; only when she started climbing in her mid-30s did something click. There\u2019s a particular kind of sweetness to discovering, relatively late in life, that there are races where winning isn\u2019t really the point. There\u2019s something too, I think, about the way exercise has gone so public and in your face. All those apps automatically uploading people\u2019s run times and routes to Facebook, or the yummy mummy fashion for doing the school run in spray-on leggings and Fitbits, make it rather hard to ignore. But peer pressure isn\u2019t the only thing driving us late converts to exercise. Middle age is where things start to go wrong that can\u2019t be fixed. It\u2019s not death that frightens me so much as the prospect of a long slow decline. Frailty, dependency, the intense vulnerability implicit in getting old before your time. Who can afford to get ill, slow down, seize up? My generation had our kids relatively late, and need to be able to kick a football around the garden for years yet. The state of our pensions is such that we\u2019ll probably have to work until we\u2019re 70. The physical demands once placed on human bodies by manual labour are disappearing but new ones are coming, forging new divides between those whose bodies will be able to take it and those whose bodies, unfortunately, won\u2019t.   Related: Can Sadiq Khan stand up to bike bashers and make London a cycling city?    And while experts squabble over whether it\u2019s too much fat or carbs that are killing us, the evidence that exercise may have a protective effect against everything from heart disease to Alzheimer\u2019s is quietly piling up. Forget all the guff about runner\u2019s high. After years of stopping and starting, I have finally accepted that I don\u2019t really like the actual running element of running. The thing I do like is the sense of a body doing what it exists to do, the feeling that, just occasionally (on a downhill stretch, with following wind), everything is still miraculously working as it should: muscles moving, blood singing, lungs not actually collapsing. It\u2019s like starting an old car on an icy morning and being amazed when it splutters into life. We late converts don\u2019t just run and cycle because it\u2019s there, as George Mallory said of Everest. We do it because we can, and because only now do we understand that we won\u2019t be able to do it for ever. Running? It\u2019s really just another word for counting your blessings.",
