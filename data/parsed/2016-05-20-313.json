Nurse Kim Wilde (Jo Brand, who also co-wrote) \u2013 last seen in stark, dark comedy Getting On, about a geriatric ward \u2013 has left the NHS and now works for private domiciliary care company Buccaneer 2000. (It\u2019s the kind of company where the ghastly phrase \u201cgoing forward\u201d comes naturally to management types. Good title). That should be better for Kim, in terms of working conditions, flexibility, remuneration etc, right? Oh, guess what, actually not. The hours are horrendous, she\u2019s messed about, bullied and paid peanuts. Nor is it much better for the cared for. When it was the council who did it things were much better, says one of Kim\u2019s patients, an old lady who ate a packet of chocolate biscuits for breakfast because no one came in the morning (unless they did, and she\u2019s forgotten). Kim\u2019s running late, but she finds time to help Mrs Biscuits Breakfast with a 50th birthday card for the son who never visits. She\u2019ll post it too, once she\u2019s put a stamp on it. Kim\u2019s like that, she\u2019ll do a bit extra, and won\u2019t get thanked for it. It\u2019s not just about Nurse Kim\u2019s work this time. Things are hard at home too. The toaster\u2019s not popping up for a start, and while she\u2019s looking into that, the work tunic she was ironing gets burnt. When she finally gets through to Buccaneer 2000 after hours of on-hold hell, she\u2019s told she\u2019ll have to pay \u00a332 for a new one. Meanwhile husband Dave (Omid Djalili), a private driver, is moaning about the deductions on his payslip (understandably, they\u2019re more than his take-home). Their son\u2019s not going to school today because he\u2019s got to look after his baby. The baby\u2019s great gran \u2013 Kim\u2019s mum \u2013 is old and not well. And there\u2019s a damp patch on the wall. Hilarious. Actually it\u2019s not \u2013 hilarious. To be honest I didn\u2019t laugh once. Maybe a couple of snorts of appreciative recognition. Even Getting On, which wasn\u2019t very funny, was funnier, mainly because of the hopeless doctor character played by Vicki Pepperdine. Here Dave and his driver pal Terry (Tom Davis) provide if not actual laughs then at least some lightness, but it\u2019s relative lightness \u2013 about corporate exploitation, professional dissatisfaction, failure \u2026 Hahaha. So it\u2019s not that funny, for a comedy. But it is sharply observed, nicely performed, with credible dialogue, some of which is surely improvised. The days when sitcom meant a door opening, someone walking in and delivering a one-line, then pausing for the canned laughter, are nearly over, thankfully. Plus it captures a hellish world where people come second to profit, a world of care that doesn\u2019t care. And it will strike a chord with \u2013 or maybe send a shudder through \u2013 anyone who has ever worried about money, or has or will have elderly relatives who need or will need help. Everyone, in other words. Next, Alzheimer\u2019s ambassador Angela Rippon, 71, sets out to find The\u00a0Truth About Dementia (BBC1). In her cute little sports car (Angela used to present Top Gear you may remember, which she managed to do without punching anyone). It\u2019s not just a journalistic journey, it\u2019s also a personal one. Some of her best friends have dementia, her mother had it and, unsurprisingly, she\u2019s worried it might get her too. So she revisits her mum, through photos and memories, and drops in on her old pal Bob who\u2019s got it and his wife Ida who is struggling to cope. And then she talks to the people in white coats who are trying to find a way of defeating it. At the extraordinary Queen Square Brain Bank she meets a healthy brain, firm and white like a fresh young cauliflower, and one from someone who had Alzheimer\u2019s, more like a pickled walnut. The professor (blue coat actually, and purple gloves) slices it up, like a truffle, to show us the hippocampus, where memories are stored. Or aren\u2019t, in the case of the walnut. Angela undergoes tests herself \u2013 cognitive, a brain scan, and finally a DNA test \u2013 to see if she\u2019s showing any signs of dementia or has any extra risk of getting Alzheimer\u2019s. The results: sharp as a whip, nothing abnormal, no extra risk, respectively. Phew. God, I can\u2019t remember that name and address in her cognitive test, a couple of hours after hearing it repeated several times. Harry \u2026 Ramsden? (No, he\u2019s the fish man, and he was in Going Forward, oddly, in Baghdad even more oddly.) Harry Barnes! At 73 Orchard Road, Grove? No, it\u2019s gone, help. Actually you can help yourself, a bit. Learning another language is good, as is any kind of mental exercise, plus lots of sleep. Quick, do the sudoku now, and sign up for that Chinese class. Then go to bed.",
