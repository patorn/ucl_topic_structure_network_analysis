One night in March, Guardian Australia rented the place for a forum on equal marriage. The platform was crowded with campaigners, comedians and politicians. Turning out for the event was every letter of the GLBTI alphabet. Shorten was there with his wife, Chloe, who cut a vivid figure even in that crowd in a leopard-skin raincoat. Shorten was entirely at ease.     Bill Shorten, Ally Hocking Howe and former NSW premier Kristina Keneally at the Guardian Live Australian marriage equality event in Sydney. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian    He has brought the party a long way. I remember sitting with Julia Gillard\u2019s dour tactician John McTernan in early 2013 as he tried to convince me Labor could beat Abbott by campaigning as the modern party. \u201cWhat about equal marriage?\u201d I asked. McTernan was silent. The issue was already totemic, a pointer to which century a political party was operating in, but the branch of the Catholic church known as the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees\u2019 Association had used its great muscle to stack parliament with men and women prepared to die in a ditch for traditional marriage. Shorten changed that. Behind the scenes at the Labor conference in Melbourne in 2014 he bluntly told the shoppies equal marriage was going to happen. No rebellion followed. Meanwhile, the Coalition was tearing itself apart on the issue. Turnbull might once have been on the dance-hall platform in March with Shorten and the leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale. Not now. Backtracking on equal marriage has done the prime minister great damage in middle Australia. Labor\u2019s strategic dream in 2013 has become reality in 2016: in this contest, Shorten is leading the modern party. Busybodies He had a story for the rally. That morning at an RAAF wreath-laying ceremony he had been accosted by a little old lady who cried, \u201cGod will damn you for your position on marriage equality.\u201d Then she slipped him a note: \u201cAnd your child\u2019s undisciplined too.\u201d In language you don\u2019t expect Labor leaders to use, Shorten gave busybodies a spray.  People judging lesbian or gay or bisexual or transgender relationships are actually judging more than just those groups. They are judging the single parents; they are judging the people who have got divorced. I live in a blended family. I have stepchildren who I regard as my own children. So this is the point I think that we are seeing: the face of what constitutes a family is changing. Good luck to people who have never been divorced. But do you know what? If you\u2019ve been divorced, you\u2019re an equally worthy human being.  And children are raised not just by same-sex couples but raised in blended families. The good news is \u2013 and this is why there is change in the Labor party, quite significant change in a relatively short time \u2013 that we know now that families come in all shapes and sizes. I bitterly resent when I hear some people judging other relationships. Until you are in that relationship, until you are raising those children, get out of my life. I don\u2019t want your opinions \u2026 I represent a whole lot of Australians who in the last 10 years have started waking up and thinking about it and being touched by personal stories. The good news is that the religious right no longer owns the definition of what a family is. And they can\u2019t win.\u201d    Related: Lucky man: has Bill Shorten got what it takes?    The bookies aren\u2019t betting Shorten can win either. That he might emerge this year as prime minister hasn\u2019t gripped the national imagination. No one is asking the Labor leader what he will do in his first 100 days. But in late summer, as the polls swung back in Labor\u2019s favour, even hostile commentators agreed: Shorten can\u2019t be ruled out. They had been wrong so often, as blow after blow failed to knock him out. He survived Dyson Heydon. He survived the rise of Malcolm Turnbull. He survived the last polls of 2015 that put the Coalition\u2019s two-party-preferred vote at 53% and Labor\u2019s at 47%. By late February, Newspoll and Essential had the parties level-pegging. Shorten admits he didn\u2019t predict this. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t predict I was going to be wiped out either.\u201d \u2018The government has crumpled inwards\u2019 \u201cI thought that when Malcolm Turnbull took over that politics would be harder for us, but politics might be better overall and it would be an opportunity for everyone to lift their game,\u201d says Shorten. \u201cWhen you play a better or a smarter opponent, it forces you to work harder, doesn\u2019t it? \u2026 what has surprised me is that the government has crumpled inwards.\u201d      The cover of Faction Man, David Marr\u2019s book on Bill Shorten    Shorten found himself facing an opponent easier to grapple with. \u201cAbbott is a master at turning a stick into a club. He is a puncher. Turnbull talks too much, doesn\u2019t focus enough. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s match-fit. I don\u2019t get the impression he\u2019s clear what he wants to do.\u201d While the government talks housekeeping \u2013 shifting the tax mix, attending to the deficit \u2013 Labor is talking policy. It may be crazy brave. Billions are at stake backing Gonski and the National Disability Insurance Scheme in the years ahead. But fading fast as Labor\u2019s policies come under attack from the government is the old image of Shorten as a shapeshifter interested only in power. Playing strongly to his advantage is Turnbull\u2019s shift away from the constant wedging of Labor on national security. The humiliations Shorten accepted to prevent his party being branded as soft on terrorism seem \u2013 at least for the moment \u2013 a thing of the past. He looks more like a leader as a result. These days the rule-of-law arguments he might have raised in defence of Muslim Australians, refugees and whistleblowers, he now deploys to defend unionists who might fall foul of a re-empowered Australian Building and Construction Commission. \u201cThe ABCC should deal with ordinary industrial laws, not criminal matters. But the government\u2019s given it extraordinary coercive powers on the back of Dyson Heydon\u2019s royal commission \u2026 powers more draconian to deal with tradies on Australian building sites than for police or courts handling ice trafficking or terrorism.\u201d    My job isn\u2019t to convince Malcolm Turnbull or News Limited that they should vote for me  Bill Shorten     Shorten cuts a different figure these days. The body language is not as exaggerated. He has abandoned his most irritating pose: faux-thoughtful. His brows are no longer theatrically creased for the cameras. The serious face he presents now looks like his own. He\u2019s looking for his old voice, the one he had before he went into parliament. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is talk to people and make sure our polices are speaking to their future. I\u2019m very clear now. I feel I have a clarity of purpose that has been two and a half years in the making.\u201d Nine hundred and counting  We\u2019ve met on a hot Sydney autumn afternoon at roughly the 900-day mark of his leadership of the opposition. He\u2019s fond of the figure, which crops up again and again in our conversation: \u201cWe\u2019ve spent 900 days working on what we think we should do ... \u201d I observe it\u2019s a strange sort of a job being leader of the opposition: whoever has it wants desperately to be rid of it. Shorten cuts me off: \u201cIt\u2019s the job before the one you want, but in my opinion the only way to get to the job you want is to do the job you\u2019ve got.\u201d There\u2019s something of the flavour of Xavier in the way he talks up the value of the long grind of opposition. \u201cYou can\u2019t know what this job is on the first day. What you learn about being an opposition leader is acquired over time, from scars, with lessons, with talking to people, with what governments do, how your party organises its ideas. To anyone who came to me and said, \u2018One day I\u2019d like to be prime minister,\u2019 I would say to them, \u2018First you must be opposition leader, because the lessons you\u2019re learning now will make you a better prime minister.\u2019 I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve enjoyed every day of opposition, but I can say that I think I\u2019m a better leader for every day I\u2019ve had.\u201d   Related: Australians crave change. But this election won't deliver it | David Marr    Australian politics are said to be volatile. Really, they\u2019re repetitive. The same stories are told, the same scenes recur again and again with only a switch of cast. It\u2019s as if the system itself is incapable of learning. We find ourselves in so many ways where we were in Gillard\u2019s time. An opposition leader not much loved faces a prime minister under attack from within. There was at least an argument last time that restoring Rudd might revive the fortunes of his party. Not a skerrick of such hope attaches to Abbott. The government is restive. The opposition is disciplined. Again the country wonders if an opposition leader can rise above the narrow politics that brought him to the top. There\u2019s no doubt Bill Shorten would have made a fine premier of Victoria. But can he scale up? \u201cI look forward to demonstrating that,\u201d he says. \u201cI know what the nation should look like in 10 and 15 years\u2019 time and it\u2019s up to me to tell that story to the nation. My job isn\u2019t to convince Malcolm Turnbull or News Limited that they should vote for me. My job is to convince Australians I have a plan for the future.\u201d \u2022 Faction Man by David Marr is published by Black Inc on 18 May priced $22.99",
