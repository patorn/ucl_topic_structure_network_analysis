  "body": "Name: Labrador. Age: Exactly 100, if we go by when the breed club was formed in the UK, although they are at least a century older than that. Appearance: Barrel chest, floppy ears, pleading eyes. Typically black, yellow or chocolate-coloured. Like to hunt, swim and play with toilet rolls. Misnomer: Labradors don\u2019t come from the Canadian province of Labrador. They come from the Canadian island of Newfoundland \u2013 part of the same province \u2013 and are derived from the St John\u2019s water dog.   Related: Owners must take the lead on canine obesity | Brief letters    Most popular dogs in the world, aren\u2019t they? They are indeed. More than twice as popular as any other breed in the UK and the US. And the cleverest? Depends how you look at it. Stanley Coren\u2019s 1994 book The Intelligence of Dogs ranked them seventh \u2013 border collies were top \u2013 and new research suggests their intelligence and trainability as assistance dogs are mainly the result of their love of food. Don\u2019t all dogs love food? Maybe, but a team of scientists at the University of Cambridge has shown that many labradors are genetically incapable of stopping themselves eating. Those most disposed to eat are also the ones that learn to perform tasks fastest, because food is used as an incentive. Your grasp of the science seems a bit vague. It\u2019s something to do with a bit of the POMC gene having been deleted. Why did the POMC gene get deleted? Possibly because among St John\u2019s water dogs \u2013 which were used to retrieve nets, ropes and fish from the sea \u2013 eating enormous amounts conferred a genetic advantage. Survival of the fattest. So, obesity is good for you? Only if you spend your life retrieving nets in freezing seas. Three famous labradors: Injured serviceman Allen Parton\u2019s assistance dog Endal, whose party trick was to operate a cash machine. David Blunkett\u2019s guide dog Lucy, whose political astuteness was so great she once threw up in the House of Commons during a speech by David Willetts. Omar Riviera\u2019s guide dog Dorado, who was with his owner on the 71st floor of the north tower at the World Trade Center on 9/11. He stayed calm among the chaos and led Riviera to safety. Most likely to say: \u201cWoof, woof.\u201d Least likely to say: \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass on the second helpings.\u201d",
