  "body": "Diego Costa and Juan Mata have both been left out of Spain\u2019s provisional squad for their Euro 2016 campaign by Vicente del Bosque while there is also no place in the two-times defending champions\u2019 squad for Fernando Torres.   Related: Euro 2016: how England, France, Spain, Germany, Belgium and Italy shape up    Costa has endured a below-par season with Chelsea despite finding the net 16 times and after suffering a hamstring injury in Chelsea\u2019s 1-1 draw with Liverpool earlier this month, Guus Hiddink admitted he was unsure if the Brazil-born forward would recover in time for next month\u2019s tournament in France. He was also left out of the Spain squad in March for friendlies with Italy and Romania and Del Bosque, speaking at the announcement of his squad, confirmed he was not prepared to risk Costa, who scored just one goal in qualifying, or Arsenal\u2019s Santi Cazorla, who made his return from a long-term knee injury for Arsenal on Sunday. \u201cWe have weighed everything up,\u201d Del Bosque was quoted as saying by ESPN. \u201cWe do not want to call up too many people with doubts over their fitness. The Cazorla situation is very like Diego\u2019s \u2013 he has been out five months, made a great effort to be ready, but we can\u2019t have many doubts.\u201d Mata meanwhile has paid the price for a recent dip in form for Manchester United, who have effectively missed out on a place in the top four, while Del Bosque\u2019s decision to omit Torres, whose form has improved in Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s run to the Champions League final, leaves Spain looking light in attack.    \u00a1RECUERDA!\ud83d\udcdd Lista provisional de 25 jugadores para la #EURO2016 + 11 jugadores que se incorporar\u00e1n el 23/5 pic.twitter.com/3LikjbucFy\u2014 Selecci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola (@SeFutbol) May 17, 2016    Paco Alc\u00e1cer, Spain\u2019s highest scorer in qualifying with five goals, also misses out in favour of Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s uncapped forward Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez, the 35-year-old Aritz Aduriz, Nolito, Juventus\u2019 \u00c1lvaro Morata and Real Madrid\u2019s Lucas V\u00e1zquez, who is also yet to make an appearance for the national side.
