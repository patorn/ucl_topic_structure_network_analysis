  "body": "WHAT ABOUT BOB(BY M)? Newcastle United and Norwich City were relegated from the Premier League on Wednesday night and their fans immediately began clamouring for their managers to remain in situ. Everton, meanwhile, confirmed a lower-table finish while successfully fulfilling their 37th league fixture, turning up in Sunderland bang on time and in matching uniforms, yet poor old Bobby M still found himself the subject of mass derision. Has the Premier League really become so cut-throat that fans demand more from managers than good grooming and impeccable manners? Yes, or so Joe Kinnear told us. But it\u2019s not only fans, it\u2019s also Everton\u2019s board, which met today to discuss the terms of a severance package for Bobby M. And we\u2019re not talking about terms such as \u201coff you go\u201d and \u201cboot up the hole\u201d but rather a pay-off to the tune of several million pounds, so maybe you should think again before mocking M\u2019s ability to find positives in every failure. Man knows what he\u2019s talking about.   Related: Roberto Mart\u00ednez sacked by Everton after disappointing season    M is nothing if not a fine talker. The Fiver could listen for hours to him talking about his devotion to attacking football so audacious and sophisticated that after 37 matches Everton have racked up a goal difference of +1. But The Fiver can tune out any time it wants, whereas Everton fans have had to listen to it for years and there came a point \u2013 actually, several \u2013 when the discrepancy between the words tumbling out of M\u2019s mouth and the evidence on the pitch was too much for even the drunkest fans to bear. Plucking the positives from being outscored at home by Tony Pulis\u2019s West Brom, for instance, is flat-out trolling. All in all, it seems best for everyone concerned that M has now been freed to concentrate on other interests, ones that do not demand coordinating the movements of John Stones and Phil Jagielka, which, sadly, rules out a Jason Derulo tribute act. As M ponders the next step in his career, Everton are keen to get in a replacement. As if by coincidence, Frank de Boer has resigned as Ajax manager. \u201cWhat I will do I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d said the man who guided the Amsterdammers to four Dutch titles in six years and respectable showings in Europe. \u201cI began to realise more that it was time for something else,\u201d whooped De Boer, already displaying uncanny alignment with Everton\u2019s wavelength. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe are devastated at our relegation from the Premier League \u2026 The process of scrutinising what went wrong and planning for what is to come has already begun\u201d \u2013 Newcastle suit Lee Charnley could do with starting close to home after the Magpies were relegated to the Championship, where they\u2019ll now face the likes of Aston Villa.     It\u2019s happened again. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA    FIVER LETTERS \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see Newcastle United, the only team in the league so bad that they couldn\u2019t even beat Aston Villa (Villa!) relegated, but the good thing about Mike Ashley is that he learns from his mistakes and is nailed on to only choose winners in the future. Oh\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cI was quite taken with the photo of the 100 or so \u2018spectators\u2019 in front of the Manchester United coach shown across various media on Monday night. In the old days all the arms would have been either throwing bricks, bottles or two fingers; worth of disapproval at the occupants of said coach. Now they are just holding mobile phones. Is this progress?\u201d \u2013 Michael Coulthurst. \u201cDid I read right that John Whittingdale is lecturing the FA about \u2018reform\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs). Is this the same John Whittingdale who I\u2019ve been seeing a bit of in the news? Now, while the FA certainly isn\u2019t perfect and undoubtedly has a lot of progress to make, isn\u2019t this slightly reminiscent of that time the pot had a go at the kettle? So anyway, that\u2019s the BBC he wants to dismantle, and the FA. What\u2019s next? If he\u2019s not careful there won\u2019t actually be any culture left to secretary, in which case he will have done himself out of a job\u201d \u2013 Dan Makeham. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear about Watford\u2019s plethora of train stations (yesterday\u2019s Still Want More?). My team Brighton have just the one, it\u2019s only about 100 yards from the stadium but it still takes an hour to get on a train \u2026 in that time you can walk back into town if you like, through all the edgy and ungentrified bits, with not a single artisan focaccia for miles around\u201d \u2013 Tony Crawford. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Michael Coulthurst.

BITS AND BOBS Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has been more highly sought than unicorn burgers, punctual trains around London and a football writer who voted for Jamie Vardy as FWA Footballer of the Year. He\u2019s now a Borussia Dortmund player. \u201cBVB showed a lot of interest in me right from an early stage and they have always kept close contact with me \u2013 this really impressed me,\u201d he trousered.     Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Dortmund-bound. Photograph: Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images    Dancing Sam Allardyce has finished his half-price Hulkamaniac routine in time to reflect on Sunderland\u2019s Premier League survival. \u201cThis club can\u2019t be cheering and doing a lap of honour every season just for escaping relegation,\u201d he cheered after doing a lap of honour for escaping relegation. Norwich\u2019s board are offering no assurances over Alex Neil\u2019s future after they also tumbled back to the second tier. \u201cOur No1 objective this season was always to retain our Premier League status,\u201d riffed a club statement. \u201cWe have fallen short of that target and work is already under way to learn from the mistakes that contributed to our failure this season.  Sheffield United have come off a long run-up and punted Nigel Adkins out of Bramall Lane. \u201cIt saddens me to say goodbye,\u201d he sobbed as Chris Wilder waltzed in through the door. Mauricio Pochettino has signed his new five-year Tottenham contract. \u201cWe have enjoyed a great season and we believe this is just the beginning,\u201d he roared. Everybody wants some Nathan Redmond. Well, Taxpayers FC, Crystal Palace and Stoke City all do, any road. Charlton Athletic chief suit Katrien Meire has hit out at the club\u2019s fans and claims that criminal offences have been committed against her this season. \u201cFor the last couple of months, I\u2019ve had extreme abuse, I\u2019ve had criminal offences committed against myself, and I\u2019m disappointed about governance in sport, that none of the governing bodies contacted me and stood up for the fact that things are not allowed, that\u2019s one step too far,\u201d she said. You\u2019ve been wondering what Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s been doing this last 20 minutes without a story about him, haven\u2019t you. \u201cIn July I will be back,\u201d he chuntered. So we are in May. May to July is nothing. I keep enjoying my life which I\u2019m doing, keep enjoying my family. But in July I am back.\u201d POJT will not be offered a new contract by Chelsea. D1ck Advocaat is set to become Danny Blind\u2019s assistant manager with Holland.  And two match officials in the Czech league have been banned indefinitely after one appeared to be drunk on the sideline and the other was seen urinating during a live TV game between Pribram and Slavia Prague. Marek Pilny was escorted from the field at half-time, while Jiri Jech felt the urge to relieve himself behind a goal. STILL WANT MORE? How football\u2019s tactical evolution has begun to invoke the past. Jonathan Wilson goes back to the future.     A floating brain in a jar, right.
