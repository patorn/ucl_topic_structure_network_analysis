  "body": "The search for a new director of rugby has begun at Bath with names as diverse as Heyneke Meyer, Pat Lam, Gregor Townsend and Stuart Lancaster linked with the role vacated by Mike Ford on Monday. A year ago, Ford was the Premiership\u2019s director of rugby of the season; now his team\u2019s ninth-placed finish has inclined the Bath chairman, Bruce Craig, to send him on his way. \u201cIt was an honour to be part of the Bath Family for four years,\u201d wrote Ford on Twitter. \u201cThank you to the staff and players, past and present, for their commitment. Thank you to the Bath Family for your unbelievable support. Disappointed I couldn\u2019t take the next step with you! I leave Bath Rugby with so many wonderful memories and now look forward to embracing the new opportunities that lie ahead.\u201d   Related: Mike Ford looking forward to \u2018embracing new opportunities\u2019 after leaving Bath    Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, a club with a settled panel of staff were polishing the Champions Cup and preparing for a home semi-final in the Premiership play-offs. Mark McCall, Saracens\u2019 director of rugby, rued the departure of his rival. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been like that for a few years. When I first arrived, for the first couple of years, there\u2019d be four or five people who\u2019d be there at the Premiership launch who weren\u2019t at the end of the season, but that hasn\u2019t been the case for quite a long time. If you look at the clubs who have done OK over the years in England, in Ireland, in France, they\u2019ve all had continuity, not just with the head coach but with staff and players who have been there for a bit. If you chop and change all the time you\u2019re never going to be successful in the long term.\u201d Saracens were not exactly models of consistency themselves in the early years of the professional era, but in 2009 they settled on a new regime under Brendan Venter, who brought in McCall the same year. The latter assumed the reins a year and a half later and has patiently cultivated the current squad. Last weekend\u2019s European triumph was achieved as much as anything by a cohesion that can only be fostered over time.\u201cThe club had a certain reputation seven years ago when Brendan started this project,\u201d said McCall. \u201cThe intention was to try to make it a bit more home grown, but you also need your signings from outside the club. I think we\u2019ve got a really good balance of those who\u2019ve come through the system and some outstanding people who haven\u2019t. Our starting XV on the weekend had 11 English guys.\u201d The most successful English clubs of recent years, Saracens, Leicester, Northampton and Harlequins, are all notable for continuity of regime, as are the latest darlings of the English game, Exeter. Wasps, too, stuck with Dai Young, despite flirting with relegation in 2012, his first season, despite the glories they had grown used to the decade before. This weekend\u2019s Premiership semi-finals will serve as testament to the virtues of a chairman\u2019s patience.",
