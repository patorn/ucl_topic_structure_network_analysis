  "body": "Eric Cantona has controversially suggested the ethnicity of Karim Benzema and Hatem Ben Arfa may have been a factor in the France manager Didier Deschamps leaving the pair out of his squad for next month\u2019s European Championship. Ben Arfa, a former Newcastle forward, was only named on standby despite a brilliant season for Nice that has seen him linked with a move to Barcelona. But it is Benzema\u2019s exclusion after he was questioned by police in connection with an alleged attempt by one of his friends to blackmail his international team-mate Mathieu Valbuena over a sex tape which is given particularly short shrift by Cantona, who turned 50 on Tuesday.   Related: Eric Cantona: \u2018I love Jos\u00e9 Mourinho but he is not Manchester United\u2019    Cantona described the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, as a hypocrite because he urged Deschamps to leave Benzema out while French politicians embroiled in scandal stay in their jobs. \u201cBenzema is a great player. Ben Arfa is a great player,\u201d Cantona told the Guardian. \u201cBut Deschamps, he has a really French name. Maybe he is the only one in France to have a truly French name. Nobody in his family mixed with anybody, you know. Like the Mormons in America. \u201cSo I\u2019m not surprised he used the situation of Benzema not to take him. Especially after Valls said he should not play for France. And Ben Arfa is maybe the best player in France today. But they have some origins. I am allowed to think about that.\u201d Asked if he was really suggesting that Deschamps \u2013 a former France team-mate who he also described as \u201ca muppet\u201d \u2013 had been guilty of discriminating against the pair, Cantona added: \u201cMaybe no, but maybe yes. Why not? One thing is for sure \u2013 Benzema and Ben Arfa are two of the best players in France and will not play the European Championship. And for sure, Benzema and Ben Arfa, their origins are north African. So, the debate is open.\u201d Deschamps declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.     The France manager Didier Deschamps has come in for some strong criticism from his compatriot Eric Cantona. Photograph: Bob Edme/AP    Cantona, who won the last of his 45 caps for France in 1995, has never enjoyed the healthiest relationship with Les Bleus and insists he will be supporting Roy Hodgson\u2019s England instead this summer. One of the great international sporting festivals will take place against a backdrop of rising right-wing nationalism across the continent, a spiralling refugee crisis and security fears in a country left on edge by November\u2019s terror attacks in Paris. \u201cFor sure, if France win the European Championship the politicians will use that success \u2013 just as they did [after the World Cup] in \u201998. But it\u2019s just politics,\u201d said Cantona, who this week launched ITV\u2019s marketing campaign for its sports coverage this summer. \u201cThe people from the right, they use this situation. They mix everything. They mix up Daesh, the bombing, the refugees. We have to be cleverer. There are people here who really need help. They are the ones we should think about.\u201d",
