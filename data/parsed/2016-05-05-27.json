Related: Liverpool 3-0 Villarreal (agg 3-1): five Europa League talking points | Jacob Steinberg    The Liverpool manager was careful not to take anything for granted \u2013 \u201cgreat moments and great nights don\u2019t just happen at Anfield because you step off a bus and touch the sign, great things happen here because players and supporters make them happen\u201d \u2013 though it seemed to be a given that England\u2019s last representatives in Europe would not slide out of contention as meekly as Manchester City did in Madrid, and Villarreal probably knew that as well as everyone else. Klopp also noted that Villarreal\u2019s current status in La Liga should not be underestimated. They have just confirmed Champions League qualification for next season, they have only Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico and Real Madrid ahead of them, and they have recorded victories this season over both the 2016 Champions League finalists. In the light of that, Klopp\u2019s decision to bring Emre Can straight back into action was a bold one, possibly based on the German midfielder\u2019s immense performance in the last round against Dortmund. During that match, just before Can succumbed to the ankle injury that kept him out of four subsequent league games, he trotted across to the bench to reassure his manager \u2013 wrongly as it turned out \u2013 that he would be fine to play on. That showed his commitment and determination. Klopp responded with a playful shoulder charge, the sort of thing you normally see on the sidelines of a rugby pitch. That showed he appreciated his player\u2019s commitment, as well as his contribution. Can was supposed to be out for much longer but if the player believes he is ready to return, Klopp is evidently not one to argue. The manager\u2019s faith in his player was vindicated after a mere six minutes. Villarreal had already had two decent attempts on goal by that stage, so Can stepped up to impose himself on proceedings, carrying the ball across the halfway line and spreading it first left then right, eventually providing the diagonal pass that allowed Nathaniel Clyne to send in the cross that led to the first goal. Klopp\u2019s point about the Spanish club\u2019s slightly over-enthusiastic celebration of their advantage from the first leg, when it had arrived only courtesy of a last-minute goal, seemed valid at that point. It had taken Liverpool almost no time to wipe it out, and the feverish nature of the home side\u2019s early pressing meant Villarreal briefly did look as if they didn\u2019t know what had hit them. Another goal might have hit them only a few minutes after the first had Adam Lallana been able to make any sort of connection to James Milner\u2019s perfectly weighted ball into the box, but Villarreal were reprieved and the match settled into a sort of fractious midfield parity. It was not quite Chelsea v Spurs on Monday night fractious but the Hungarian referee certainly had his work cut out, with Denis Su\u00e1rez in particular aggrieved at every incident, Roberto Soldado losing his temper and the fourth official frequently having to interrupt a simmering row between Klopp and Marcelino on the touchline. Soldado was booed off when he was substituted before the end. Hardly recognisable as the inoffensive and frequently anonymous striker who once played for Spurs, he had made himself thoroughly unpopular. As had V\u00edctor Ruiz, who did well to last 71 minutes before seeing a red card.   Related: Liverpool push past 10-man Villarreal and into Europa League final    By the time the interval arrived with no break to the parity two things were clear: Villarreal were indeed a sturdy and capable side, not about to lose their bearings because of a partisan crowd or a physical battle; and unlike the Dortmund goalfest the tie would probably go to the next side to score. Liverpool were enjoying more of the game but their opponents had chances too, such as when C\u00e9dric Bakambu had to be blocked by Lovren at the start of the second half, and Villarreal had the away goals rule in their favour. It is to Liverpool\u2019s credit that they stayed strong enough to break their opponents down before Villarreal went down to 10 men. Once Sevilla took a decisive lead in the other semi-final, it became clear that only Liverpool were standing in the way of Spanish domination of this year\u2019s European finals. When Daniel Sturridge scored their second just past the hour, this time with a proper finish from Roberto Firmino\u2019s pass, they all but denied Villarreal the chance to join Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico and Sevilla. Nothing has been won yet, and Liverpool still face the competition specialists in the final in Basel, but as Klopp might have said in his wholly justified appreciation of Spanish strengths, that is not bad company to be keeping.",
