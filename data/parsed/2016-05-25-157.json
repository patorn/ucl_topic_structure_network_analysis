  "body": "This is how to win the women\u2019s vote, 2016 style: Blame your competition for her husband\u2019s sexual misconduct. Dredge up accusations \u2013 never proven \u2013 that she is married to a rapist. Remind voters of her family\u2019s tabloid past and assume they\u2019ll forget about your own tawdry story when they go to the ballot box on 8 November. If Donald Trump\u2019s strategy actually brings down Hillary Clinton, then this race for the White House will probably be remembered as the ugliest, most counterintuitive presidential election in US history. Because who would have have thought that a thrice-married, proudly philandering Republican could take the high road against a Democrat who has committed no sexual sins of her own?   Related: Protests at Donald Trump rally overshadow Washington primary win    \u201cTo me, he is digging the hole he has with female voters several feet deeper to suggest in any way, shape or form that Hillary is other than a victim of her husband\u2019s dalliances,\u201d said the political strategist Darry Sragow. \u201cIt seems to me it would be deeply offensive to women whose life experience is to the contrary,\u201d Sragow said. But \u201cI\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s pretty dangerous to be certain about people\u2019s reactions.\u201d The billionaire businessman has been filling the airwaves with what the Clinton campaign derides as gutter-level politic attacks because he \u201cmay see his own personal life as a liability\u201d, said Claremont McKenna College political scientist John J Pitney Jr. \u201cHe may think that the best defense is a good offense,\u201d Pitney continued. \u201cThe question is whether people can be persuaded to see Hillary as somehow culpable for what Bill Clinton did.\u201d Trump raised the ante on Monday by releasing an ad on Instagram showing a cigar-smoking Bill Clinton with voiceover from two women who accused the former president in the 1990s of sexual assault. Clinton or his attorney denied the allegations at the time. But he began hammering away at Hillary Clinton using her husband\u2019s past as a weapon just three days after John Kasich, the Ohio governor, dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination, leaving Trump the presumptive nominee. At an Oregon rally on 7 May, Trump started out in a sing-song voice describing himself as the perfect gentleman: \u201cBy the way, nobody respects women more.\u201d And then: \u201cDid you see what Hillary Clinton did to the women Bill had affairs with? And they\u2019re going after me with women? Give me a break.\u201d During an 18 May interview with Sean Hannity, Trump was asked about a recent New York Times article describing the real estate mogul\u2019s checkered past with women. Hannity named three women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and said he wondered if the Times would interview them. \u201cIn one case, it\u2019s about exposure,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cIn another case, it\u2019s about groping and fondling and touching against a woman\u2019s will.\u201d \u201cAnd rape,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cAnd rape,\u201d Hannity agreed. The Clinton campaign\u2019s response? \u201cTrump is doing what he does best, attacking when he feels wounded and dragging the American people through the mud for his own gain,\u201d the campaign press secretary, Nick Merrill, said in a written statement. \u201cIf that\u2019s the kind of campaign he wants to run, that\u2019s his choice. Hillary Clinton is running a campaign to be President for all of America.\u201d Hannity, however, did not delve into Trump\u2019s own sexual misconduct. The real estate tycoon\u2019s first divorce was smeared across the tabloids, which were filled with rumors about Trump\u2019s relationship with the woman who would become Wife No 2 while he was still married to Wife No 1. He is currently married to Wife No 3. In his 1997 memoir The Art of the Comeback, Trump bragged: \u201cIf I told the real stories of my experiences with women, often seemingly very happily married and important women, this book would be a guaranteed best-seller.\u201d And then there were the interviews with radio shock jock Howard Stern, discussions of his personal proclivities, his current wife\u2019s bowel habits and his insistence that all intimate partners should be tested by his own doctor to ensure that they were clean of sexually transmitted disease. \u201cI\u2019ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world,\u201d Trump told Stern in 1997, while talking about dating and the battle to avoid infection. \u201cIt is a dangerous world out there \u2013 it\u2019s scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam era. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.\u201d All of which raises the question: what can Trump possibly gain by slamming Hillary Clinton over her husband\u2019s conduct when he has his own issues? \u201cGenerally, those who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw rocks,\u201d said the former California governor Gray Davis. \u201cIt does show you, however, how smart Trump is. Because he knows that it is so salacious that it will get into the news.\u201d And every news cycle spent on the dark cloud that follows the Clintons is one that ignores the Democrat\u2019s plans to revive the economy, put Americans back to work, fight climate change and prevent gun violence. \u201cIt\u2019s like a lunar eclipse,\u201d continued Davis, who supports Clinton\u2019s run for the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s total darkness. No one can get into the light without commenting \u2026 [Trump] reroutes your attention. That\u2019s his whole strategy.\u201d   Related: Trump has Bill Clinton's past in his sights \u2013 how should Hillary respond?    But Claremont McKenna\u2019s Pitney notes that Trump\u2019s strategy is a risky one. For starters, millennial voters are too young to remember the scandals that swirled around the Clinton administration. And even with the Trump campaign\u2019s history lessons, it is unclear whether twenty- and thirtysomethings will see Hillary Clinton as a victim or an accomplice or whether they will even care. \u201cThe big question is this,\u201d Pitney said. \u201cThere probably aren\u2019t going to be any new facts coming out about Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior. But what else is going to come out about Trump? His Republican opponents didn\u2019t do a thorough job of opposition research. \u201cThe Democrats are doing a more meticulous job. I think we\u2019ll see the fruits of their labors in coming weeks.\u201d",
