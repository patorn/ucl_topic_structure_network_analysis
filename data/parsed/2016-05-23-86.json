  "body": "The increasingly bitter relationship between Sports Direct and Rangers FC took yet another dive on Monday as the football club launched legal proceedings against the retailer, its founder Mike Ashley and four of the club\u2019s former executives. The civil case lists Rangers\u2019 former chief executives Charles Green and Derek Llambias, former director Imran Ahmad, and former finance director Brian Stockbridge as \u201cdefenders\u201d alongside the sportswear chain and its billionaire boss.  It is not known what the latest action concerns but it comes against the backdrop of a series of legal fights between Rangers and Sports Direct. Ashley owns 8.92% of Rangers and 55% of Sports Direct, which has a merchandising joint venture with the club that has made the Scottish Championship winners about 4p from every pound spent in its Ibrox store. Ahmad \u2013 who is currently believed to be overseas \u2013 and Stockbridge were appointed to Green\u2019s board when the Yorkshire businessman took charge of Rangers by purchasing the club\u2019s assets and business after it went into liquidation in the summer of 2012. Green stepped down as chief executive in 2013, while Ahmad served between June 2012 and April of the following year. Stockbridge resigned from his post in January 2014. Llambias, a close ally of Ashley, was appointed to the Rangers board in November of 2014 and became chief executive a month later, but was ousted in 2015 when a consortium led by the current chairman, Dave King, took over the club. The latest claim has been brought at the court of session in Edinburgh and was announced in the legal notices section of the Times on Monday. It stated: \u201cIf Imran Ahmad wishes to challenge the jurisdiction of the court or to defend the action, he should contact the Deputy Principal Clerk of Session, Edinburgh, EH1 1RQ immediately and in any event by not later than 21 days from the date of publication of this advertisement.\u201d Spokespeople for Sports Direct, Ashley, Llambias and Green did not respond to invitations to comment. Stockbridge did not respond to efforts to contact him, while Ahmad\u2019s exact whereabouts is not known.",
