  "body": "Paul McCartney has said Kanye West\u2019s repeated use of the N-word was justified in the context of the \u201curban generation\u201d the rapper talks about in his lyrics. Describing the rapper fondly as a \u201cmonster\u201d and \u201ca crazy guy who comes up with great stuff so he inspires me\u201d, McCartney told a star-studded audience at a Mastertapes session at the BBC\u2019s Maida Vale studios about a recent collaboration in which West used a melody by the former Beatle. \u201cI get this track back, a thing called All Day: he\u2019s taken my melody and he\u2019s made it seriously urban, which is funny because the lyrics use the N-word \u2013 a lot! \u2018How long have you been at the mall?\u2019 \u2018All day, -word!\u2019,\u201d said McCartney, according to a report by the Radio Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a great record, sonically it\u2019s brilliant, but quite a few people said, \u2018You can\u2019t be connected with this, there\u2019s, like, 40 N-words!  \u201cPeople like Oprah, who\u2019s a little conservative about that stuff, said, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t do it, even black people shouldn\u2019t use that word. I said, \u2018Yeah, but it\u2019s Kanye! And he\u2019s talking about an urban generation that uses that word in a completely different way.\u2019 It\u2019s the context. So I was actually pleased with it.\u201d West debuted All Day in a heavily censored performance at the Brits in February 2015. The melody McCartney played West is reportedly from an unreleased song from 1969 which McCartney was inspired to write, and play with two fingers on the guitar, after seeing a Picasso painting.   McCartney also told the audience, which included Brad Pitt and Paul Weller, that he \u201ctook to the bevvies\u201d after the band split up.  He said: \u201cI took to a wee dram. It was great at first, then suddenly I wasn\u2019t having a good time. It wasn\u2019t working. I wanted to get back to square one, so I ended up forming Wings. McCartney added he was glad he had reconciled with John Lennon before his death after his relationship with his former bandmate had soured over the group\u2019s finances in the 70s. He said his 1982 song Here Today, recorded two years after Lennon was murdered, was his way of telling his friend he loved him.  He said: \u201cI was thinking of all the things I never said to him. I\u2019m quite private and don\u2019t like to give too much away. Why should people know my innermost thoughts? But a song is the place to put them. In Here Today I say to John, \u2018I love you\u2019.  \u201cI couldn\u2019t have said that to him unless we were extremely drunk \u2013 \u2018I love you, man!\u2019 But you can put these emotions, these deeper and sometimes awkward truths, in a song.\u201d",
