  "body": "Hardly a week has gone by recently without dramatic headlines about Saudi Arabia planning far-reaching changes. And every report features the intriguing character of Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince and rising star of an increasingly unpredictable kingdom. Bin Salman, an imposing man of 30, oversees a team of advisers and ministers who are working on the grandiosely named Vision 2030 \u2013 designed to prepare pampered Saudis for a life after oil by diversifying, privatising and modernising the largest economy in the Arab world. Older Saudis say the prince reminds them of King Abdulaziz ibn Saud \u2013 his paternal grandfather and the revered founder of the state that bears the family name. Bin Salman lives in Diriyah, scene of the historic and still functioning pact between the ruling Al Saud family and the conservative religious establishment.   Related: Saudi Aramco \u2013 the $10tn mystery at the heart of the Gulf state    It was from there that he oversaw last weekend\u2019s reshuffle \u2013 the latest piece in the jigsaw of a dizzying 15-year transformation project. Veteran oil minister Ali al-Naimi was replaced by Khalid al-Falih, head of the national oil company Aramco and source of 90% of Saudi revenues for decades. Aramco is now up for the biggest stockmarket offering in history. Falih is to run a ministry for energy, industry and natural resources \u2013 mining is being highlighted for future development. Eight economic-related portfolios were shifted while other changes streamlined financial management and investment decision-making. \u201cThese people are technocrats on steroids,\u201d quipped one expert. Bin Salman\u2019s rise has seen power shift from the royal court to the council of ministers \u2013 though still under the watchful eye of the 80-year-old King Salman bin Abdulaziz, who made his favourite son defence minister and head of the council of economic and developmental affairs when he came to the throne last year. Bin Salman \u2013 or Mr Everything, as he has been dubbed by foreigners \u2013 is a millennial and a digital native, like the majority of the Saudi population who are under 25. His youth is a big part of his appeal and one reason Foreign Policy magazine listed him as one of the world\u2019s most influential leaders after his surprise appointment. Another novelty is greater transparency in a famously opaque system. There has been a careful drip feed of media signals that culminated in the formal launch of a still sketchy but hugely ambitious set of economic reforms last month.

Until 2015, Saudis gossiped about him being thuggish and corrupt. Now he is praised as ambitious, hardworking and open to argument. Foreigners are impressed by his ability to reel off statistics \u2013 preferring to speak Arabic but with good enough English to correct errors of interpretation. \u201cSome people are cautiously optimistic because he is changing things,\u201d says a middle-aged businessman from Dhahran, describing a new informality that has dispensed with traditional flowing bisht cloaks, ghutra headdresses and excessive courtesy in the corridors of power.  \u201cThe new style is almost Silicon Valley. But there is a lot of cynicism, too, because older people remember other big plans in the past to wean the country off oil and in the end the government always backed down. So there\u2019s a sense that he is inexperienced and may not be dealing with reality.\u201d  That criticism applies, too, to the war in neighbouring Yemen, where the Saudis stand accused of killing civilians in attacks on Houthi rebels. Assertiveness is the kingdom\u2019s new watchword at home and across a troubled region where strategic rivalry with Iran, upsetting an already volatile oil market, is the overarching theme.

On paper, King Salman\u2019s heir is the crown prince, Mohammed Bin Nayef (MBN), the security supremo and minister of interior who is liked by western governments focused on terrorism. But many believe the king will eventually bypass him and hand power to his own son, also known as MBS.  Another worry is overdependence on foreign consultants, McKinsey is one of the most important, who are insensitive to cultural issues and royal politics. \u201cMBS is the prince of war and oil,\u201d says Madawi Al-Rasheed, a London-based Saudi historian and fierce critic of the Al Saud. \u201cHis increasing stardom comes with a risk. If he succeeds, he will be tolerated. If he fails, he will be replaced when MBN becomes king.\u201d  Educated Saudis wonder out loud whether economic changes will have other implications. \u201cIt is all very well talking about business and investment and living without oil,\u201d protests an exasperated thirtysomething Riyadh professional. \u201cBut what about political change, the legal system and social issues?\u201d  Subsidies are already being cut. And if taxation is introduced to generate revenues, will royal wealth and privileges be excluded? \u201cIf people see that everyone is biting the bullet then they\u2019ll accept taxes without asking for a parliament as long as they don\u2019t feel someone else is getting their bread,\u201d suggests another Saudi. Bin Salman\u2019s biggest difficulty is likely to be jobs, with a desperate need to reduce dependence on foreigners to get young Saudis into private sector jobs rather than the undemanding and unproductive state positions so many see as their birthright.

Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images    The prince talked about opportunities for women but stopped short of saying whether the longstanding ban on driving could end. Tourism is being billed as another new cash source, and there is talk of expanding entertainment and leisure opportunities, in a country with no cinemas and austere standards of public morality. Hardline clerics \u2013 and perhaps rival royals \u2013 are watching carefully. \u201cMBS is reasonably sharp and does want to change the kingdom. But it also clear that he is not economically literate and lacks public policy experience and is surrounded by people who pander to him,\u201d a western academic who insists on remaining anonymous said. \u201cYes, he does work long hours, he is ambitious and he\u2019s not just a thief and thug. He clearly has the capacity to make things happen and he is willing to take risks. That is good to get things done but also dangerous in the long term.\u201d The jury will clearly be out for some time yet. \u201cThis is the first mile of a marathon,\u201d mused a European diplomat in Riyadh. \u201cPeople underestimated MBS, saying he is young and owes everything to his father. But he seems more determined than they thought and more eager to grasp details and numbers. And more than other royals he does realises the challenge in transforming a country that has depended on oil for almost its entire history.\u201d",
