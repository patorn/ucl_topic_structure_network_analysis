  "body": "Claudio Ranieri made an emotional phone call to Guus Hiddink to thank Chelsea for handing Leicester City the title after a tumultuous night when the Italian\u2019s name was sung loud at Stamford Bridge. Ranieri, who managed Chelsea before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was first appointed manager in 2004, telephoned Hiddink after flying back from Italy where he had been lunching with his 96-year-old mother. Tempers flared at the final whistle as Tottenham and Chelsea players and staff became embroiled in a mass brawl by the tunnel but after Eden Hazard\u2019s equaliser Ranieri\u2019s name was sung by the delighted Chelsea fans who were desperate to end Spurs\u2019 title hopes.

He thanked us especially for what we did in the second half and I congratulated him for being champions. They deserved it, it may be a bit of a shock for the established clubs that they did so well. They didn\u2019t implode, there was no tension when they started smelling the title. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any tears because it was not a Facetime conversation but his voice was trembling a bit. He said five times thanks. His emotion was going up.\u201d Hiddink, who will be replaced by Antonio Conte in the summer, did not start Eden Hazard despite the Belgian\u2019s two goals at Bournemouth last week but Hazard came on at half-time and made the decisive impact late on with a curled equaliser to send the title to the east Midlands. Hazard and Cesc F\u00e0bregas had spoken after the Bournemouth victory of their desire to end Tottenham\u2019s title ambitions here and Hiddink praised the Belgian\u2019s impact. \u201cEden has had a difficult season, a lot of injuries coming back, a lot of setbacks, he had a lot of frustrations,\u201d said the Dutch coach. \u201cHe played 90 minutes in Bournemouth in a less intense game. My plan was then for him to be of use in this game. It was more wise to bring him later on in the game and have him at full speed. He did very well, you saw there what he is capable of.\u201d It is a first Premier League title for both Ranieri and Leicester City, who were 5,000-1 shots to win the division at the beginning of the season. Despite the tempestuous nature of this finale in west London, both Hiddink and the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, said Leicester were deserved title winners.

They had a great season, they deserve the title. I\u2019m disappointed because we fought to be in the race. We\u2019re disappointed but at the same time I\u2019m proud of my players, the season was fantastic and we will still fight for second place. \u201cI want to congratulate Claudio and the Leicester players, it was a massive, amazing season for them. They deserve it, this is sure. We need to be stronger next season and try to be in the race for the title.\u201d",
