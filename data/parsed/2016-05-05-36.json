Hanging in there late in a game against North Melbourne, we\u2019re trying to block it out of our minds that Roos forward Drew Petrie has been unusually quiet, still crashing into packs with his patented bone-rattling force but perhaps not quite hauling in his usual team-lifting marks or kicking the steadying goal his side craves.  But then it happens; the ball breaks from the centre, Petrie motors away from the goal square like Dick Dastardly malevolently rounding the final bend, sprints down the middle and lays waste to a pack of players, all knobbly knees and meaty forearms as he crash-lands with the ball hugged to a chest as wide and welcoming as the team banner. Minutes later he\u2019s kicked two goals and set up another. Momentum has shifted North\u2019s way, the game is as good as gone. \u201cDrat, drat and double drat.\u201d When he first appeared in 2001, Petrie became North Melbourne\u2019s 884th player, a Roos debut wedged between that of Daniel Harris and long-retired Saverio Rocca, whose salad days of the mid-90s now feel every bit the two decades away that they are, and who has since embarked on and finished a whole other career in an entirely different sport. When Arden street oval was redeveloped to upgrade the most deplorable training facilities in the AFL, they practically built the new digs around Petrie and teammate Brent Harvey.

Rocca\u2019s among 104 players who\u2019ve appeared at senior level for North since Petrie first ran out, among long-forgotten novelties like Ricky Olarenshaw, Callum Urch, Eddie Sansbury and Cruize Garlett, but also enough similarly-sized key position players \u2013 Digby Morrell, Jonathan Hay, Leigh Harding, John Baird, Aaron Edwards \u2013 to tell you what odds he\u2019s overcome, not only in lasting so damned long at the top level but doing so dive-bombing into contests like a kamikaze fighter pilot. Every other week he seems to be slotting a couple of momentum-shifting goals and scattering dizzied defenders in his wake. Players like that tend to buckle quicker, their bodies left aching and battered from even half the number of collisions Petrie\u2019s has endured.  Since 2003, he\u2019s failed to reach 20 games for the season only once, when foot injuries recked his 2010 season (in one of only two games that year, against Sydney, he simply grimaced his way through a broken foot, determinedly playing out the game so his side wasn\u2019t one short). It\u2019s a quite phenomenal feat of durability for a player of his size and manic approach to climbing over packs, laying bone-crunching bumps and throwing himself into ruck duels. On Sunday, against St Kilda, Petrie becomes the 74th man to reach 300 games at AFL level, a feat that is impressive even before you consider it expressed as a ratio of the 12,436th players who\u2019ve reached league level \u2013 only 0.006% of them get to this point.  Petrie\u2019s value to North in the past five to six years has not always been reflected in stats sheets because sheer presence never has been (what price in North\u2019s against-odds success of the last two seasons the intimidation factor of Petrie, Jarrad Waite and Ben Brown steaming towards defenders?) but it is at calculable through his goal scoring since his defensive load lessened. He quietly reinvented himself from a player who kicked 80 goals in his first 110 games to one who has posted season totals of 48, 58, 48, 50 and 42 since 2011 , the definition of consistency and reliability in a side that often veered so wildly between its best and worst.  Between 2011 and 2014 Petrie was by most statistical definitions a top five forward of the competition \u2013 not that you heard about it much, especially not out of his mouth. The hope this week, as Petrie rightfully takes the attention that\u2019s so often lavished on others at the club, is that his teammates repay him with Petrie-like efforts of their own. In much-loved Roo Glenn Archer\u2019s 300th appearance in 2007, Petrie was the man who booted six goals in a quarter to blast away the Bulldogs. The \u201cshinboner of the century\u201d tag became something of a cliche in Archer\u2019s career but Petrie\u2019s been a worthy heir to those old-fashioned ideals; actions speaking louder than words, the team coming before the individual.  Despite being named All-Australian and once even going close to taking out the Coleman medal, somehow Petrie\u2019s never won a best and fairest award at North. But measured across a career, his value to the club in both lean times and good ones place him among their greats \u2013 a modest, one-club champion in an era where such concepts border on arcane. The saddest story of this 2016 season is that we\u2019ve had to discover how the Western Bulldogs look without Bob Murphy, their soul and conscience. Equally, there will come a time when North Melbourne need to face life without indefatigable, unassuming and invaluable Petrie. An undersold virtue of the man is that the very concept of a 21st century North Melbourne side without Petrie marauding his way towards heavy traffic is something you still cannot conceive of. Quote of the week Sydney\u2019s chairman, Andrew Pridham, was always going to be winning himself a guernsey here by labelling the Collingwood president, Eddie McGuire, and his Triple M colleagues \u201cintellectual pygmies\u201d, but the Sydney staffer really solidified his position this week with a follow-up tweet.     Some have suggested my Tweet yesterday was inappropriate and could be viewed as insulting. Fair cop. I apologise to all Pygmies.\u2014 Andrew Pridham (@Pridhamhq) May 5, 2016    Update: Pridham has since been forced to eat a little bit of humble pie after admitting that he\u2019d heard McGuire\u2019s comments out of context. Photograph of the week The spring in ruckman Brodie Grundy\u2019s step before Collingwood\u2019s Domain Stadium clash with West Coast was about as good as it got for the Pies in their 62-point loss but this Paul Kane shot still tickled our fancy.

Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty Images    Bits and bobs For a second successive week, the last round of action went a fair way to rubbishing claims that 2016 had started on an aesthetic high, with only the surprisingly close Sydney-Brisbane game and the low-scoring Carlton-Essendon clash proving any great contest. Round seven throws up at least another five clear mis-matches so gird up your loins for some uninspiring football. Our main points of interest are whether the Giants can consign Fremantle to a 0-7 start at Domain Stadium, how West Coast might fare in the unfamiliar surrounds of Simonds Stadium and, in what shapes as the match of the round, whether Adelaide and the Bulldogs can deliver the thrills their Saturday night encounter promises. All that said, this week Inside 50 is leaving you with a hot tip: despite the navel-gazing premise and granting that the last thing the world needs is yet another podcast, we suggest you check out The Sounding Board, in which veteran footy journalists Craig Hutchison and Damien Barrett rake over old grudges and tip the odd bucket over their media colleagues. It\u2019s such a horrendously bad idea that somehow it works.",
