  "body": "A 400-year-old story about a man who journeys to a mysterious royal wedding is \u201cthe first science fiction novel\u201d, long predating Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein and other, later writers considered pioneers, according to the award-winning writer John Crowley. In his opinion, the genre starts with Johann Valentin Andreae\u2019s 1616 work The Chemical Wedding, a new version of which he is publishing in November. Andreae\u2019s story opens as a winged woman, \u201cso bright and beautiful, in a sky-coloured robe\u201d, invites Christian Rosencreutz \u2013 the real-life founder of the philosophical secret society of Rosicrucianism \u2013 to a \u201cRoyal Wedding\u201d. \u201cIf God Himself decree it, Then you must to the mountain wend Where three stately temples stand. From there you\u2019ll know Which way to go. Be wise, take care, Wash well, look fair, Or else the Wedding cannot save you,\u201d says a letter which sends Christian on a seven-day journey to serve the Bridegroom and the Bride, in Crowley\u2019s new version of the text.    The Chemical Wedding is the first SF novel... a marvellous adventure rather than simply a parable or an allegory  John Crowley     The book was published in Germany in 1616 as if it were the work of Rosencreutz, and was part of the widespread excitement over Rosicrucianism. Andreae later admitted he was the author. Crowley, winner of a world fantasy award for lifetime achievement, has written a new version of the story, drawing from extant English translations and working with a German scholar. His is the first new version of the story in at least 25 years, according to publisher Small Beer Press, which will release a paperback version in November illustrated by Theo Fadel. Crowley first discovered it in the writings of Frances Yates, who thought it was a political allegory \u2013 something Crowley disagrees with. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tract, and I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s an allegory. I think it\u2019s a \u2018Thrilling Wonder Tale\u2019, taking the most extreme possibilities of the alchemy of the day and deploying them in a story as though they are actual happenings,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cScience fiction works the same way \u2013 [to] take the farthest-out science possibilities and embody them in stories. \u201cWhen Andreae confessed late in life to writing it he called it a \u2018ludibrium\u2019 \u2013 a Latin word that can mean a joke, a skit, a jeux d\u2019esprit or a hoax. I don\u2019t think he was trying to disown it, but he certainly didn\u2019t seem to want it taken with full seriousness. And it\u2019s the fun, the outlandish incident, the surprises, and the wonderful main character \u2013 Christian Rosenkreutz, an old self-doubting, curious, kindly, horny guy \u2013 all that\u2019s what I wanted to bring to new readers.\u201d     The new cover for The Chemical Wedding    Published in 1616, The Chemical Wedding predates Johannes Kepler\u2019s novel Somnium, which was written in 1608 but not published until 1634 and \u201cwhich usually gets the nod\u201d as the first science fiction story. But as Crowley writes in his introduction to The Chemical Wedding, Somnium \u201cis more of an illustrated example or thought-experiment than a real story,\u201d and while \u201cthe astronomy underlying it is new \u2026 it doesn\u2019t carry the thrill of wild but just-around-the-corner possibilities that SF ought to\u201d. He says that the science of The Chemical Wedding \u201cis late Renaissance alchemy, which had the same fascination for readers of the time as the scientific possibilities of classic SF did in its last-century heyday\u201d. Crowley admits that \u201calchemy is not science if by science we mean only what is now included in that accretion of tested knowledge that still holds up as true even if primitive or inadequate\u201d. Nonetheless, he argues, \u201calchemy is science \u2026 in the sense that it had a general picture of the material world and a rational scheme for formulating hypotheses and proceeding with investigations of it\u201d. \u201cSo that\u2019s why The Chemical Wedding is the first science fiction novel: unlike other contenders, it\u2019s fiction; it\u2019s about the possibilities of a science; and it\u2019s a novel, a marvellous adventure rather than simply a parable or an allegory or a skit or a thought experiment,\u201d writes the author, adding that \u201clike SF, it probably appealed to a self-selected readership of geeks and enthusiasts\u201d.    Alchemy isn\u2019t science, it\u2019s magic: so it\u2019s a stretch to call it \u2018science fiction\u2019.  Adam Roberts, professor at Royal Holloway and science fiction novelist     Experts in the field were delighted at the news of the book\u2019s reissue \u2013 but are not entirely convinced by Crowley\u2019s claim. \u201cIf the modern novel as such is 17th century and is a \u2018thing\u2019, then it cannot qualify as the first SF novel. If, on the other hand, any lengthy tale is a novel, surely Utopia [published in 1516] is the first SF novel,\u201d said professor Farah Mendlesohn, a science fiction academic. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not fascinating.\u201d \u201cThere are lots of 16th-century utopias and dystopias, which I\u2019d say have a better claim to being SF than Chemical Wedding \u2013 Thomas More\u2019s Utopia was first published in 1516 after all,\u201d said Adam Roberts, professor at Royal Holloway and science fiction novelist. \u201cAlchemy isn\u2019t science, it\u2019s magic: so it\u2019s a stretch to call it \u2018science fiction\u2019. Nor is this the first \u2018alchemical novel\u2019 and it certainly isn\u2019t the first magical story \u2013 there are plenty of alchemical and magical romances throughout the medieval period and further back.\u201d \u201cThere is a qualitative difference between stories of magic, which go back through medieval romance to Beowulf and the Odyssey, and stories that extrapolate from the new discourses of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, which we call \u2018science\u2019. The Chemical Wedding doesn\u2019t extrapolate anything: it\u2019s a Biblical allegory and magical fable.\u201d SF author John Clute\u2019s entry for Andreae in The Encyclopaedia of Science Fiction notes Crowley\u2019s argument, adding that \u201cin terms of its complex narrative register, the tale might also be described as a ludic fiction for its combination of burlesque, satire and deadpan elevatedness\u201d. \u201cIn the Science Fiction Encyclopedia we use the term \u2018proto SF\u2019 for most texts before Mary Shelley, and even some after,\u201d said Clute. \u201cWorking out the first SF novel is not easy \u2013 a bit like looking for the source of the Nile in an alternate world where there is no Lake Victoria to discover.\u201d",
