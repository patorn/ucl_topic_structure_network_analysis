  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull has refused to condemn Peter Dutton instead qualifying his inflammatory remarks about refugees taking Australian jobs by saying the government wanted them to get jobs. Bill Shorten has compared Peter Dutton\u2019s comments that refugees would take Australian jobs to Pauline Hanson\u2019s political views, as Labor and advocacy groups called on Malcolm Turnbull to reprimand the immigration minister. Turnbull said: \u201cPeter Dutton is an outstanding immigration minister. For more than 600 days, there has not been one successful people smuggler operation bringing unauthorised arrivals to Australia.\u201d Turnbull repeated Dutton\u2019s observation \u201cmany [refugees], large percentages of them have no English skills at all ... [many] are illiterate in their own language\u201d. He added: \u201cMany haven\u2019t completed high school. That is no fault of theirs.\u201d   Related: Peter Dutton takes the refugee scare campaign from dog whistle to foghorn| Lenore Taylor    \u201cThat is why we are reaching out to help them with compassion. What we do, in a way that many other countries do not, we invest $800m a year in ensuring they get the settlement services they need so they learn English, so they areintegrated into our society.\u201d Asked about Dutton\u2019s statement refugees took Australian jobs, Turnbull said: \u201cEverybody that comes to Australia, we want to be able to seek employment. We want to be sure that they have got the skills to do so.\u201d \u201cWe want them to become part of our workforce.\u201d When asked about Dutton\u2019s comments being xenophobic and the tone of the election campaign, Turnbull said Australia was the most successful multicultural society in the world and Australians should be proud of the migration program and humanitarian intake. Dutton made inflammatory comments about refugees in response to a question on Sky News about the Greens\u2019 policy to increase the refugee intake to 50,000. \u201cFor many people \u2013 they won\u2019t be numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English,\u201d he said in the remarks on Tuesday night.

Dutton didn\u2019t just insult refugees when he made those comments. He insulted the millions of migrants who\u2019ve contributed to making this a truly great country.\u201d Shorten said Turnbull would immediately condemn the remarks \u201cif he has a shred of self-respect left on the matter\u201d but said he was sceptical he would \u201cbecause I wonder if Turnbull is actually feeding the lines to Dutton\u201d.  \u201cAustralians expect more from their prime minister,\u201d he said. \u201cThey expect more from this electoral process that we are undertaking than run are scare campaigns and pathetic lies.\u201d    .@PeterDutton_MP says more refugees will take Australian's jobs or languish in unemployment queues #ausvotes #pmlive https://t.co/TdFlaQc8Tb\u2014 Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) May 17, 2016    Turnbull dismissed Shorten\u2019s comments as \u201cshrill\u201d and said Labor was engaging in \u201cgesture politics\u201d to appeal to Greens voters. When asked about Dutton\u2019s comments earlier on Wednesday, Turnbull said Australia invests an enormous amount of money into the settlement services, including to make sure that refugees get language instruction. \u201cSo we put \u2013 we invest more in settlement than many other countries do. So it is, it\u2019s very expensive. We don\u2019t begrudge the money but it\u2019s important to get it right.\u201d The Edmund Rice Centre, a social justice and refugee advocacy group, also called on Turnbull to immediately reprimand Dutton for the comments. The centre\u2019s director and president of the Refugee Council, Phil Glendenning, condemned the comments and said they were \u201ca blatant attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator of society \u2013 prejudice and bigotry\u201d.  \u201cNot only are these comments inaccurate, they are deeply offensive to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have come to our country over many generations,\u201d he said.  \u201cPeter Dutton\u2019s comments are simply contradictory \u2013 if refugees are illiterate, innumerate and \u2018lurking about on unemployment queues\u2019 how will they \u2018take Australian jobs\u2019? \u201cRefugees have made a positive contribution to our society \u2013 in stark contrast, the only contribution the minister is making today to our country is to peddle fear, prejudice and divisiveness. \u201cThis is a desperate attempt to blow the dog whistle and the prime minister must show the leadership to pull him into line.\u201d    .@JulieBishopMP responds to Peter Dutton's comments on refugees not being literate and numerate #ausvotes https://t.co/TFhbNhkbep\u2014 Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) May 17, 2016    Earlier on Wednesday, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, sought to defend the comments.  She said: \u201cPeter Dutton is pointing out the self-evident fact that it costs a great deal of money to settle people in Australia.\u201d When asked whether taking Australian jobs was a consideration when granting people asylum, Bishop said: \u201cIt\u2019s not one of the considerations, what he\u2019s pointing out is we would want such people to have a job if they are going to be in Australia, we don\u2019t want them to be on welfare.\u201d",
