  "body": "For Liam Scarlett, the key to Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein is not horror, but love. When Victor Frankenstein strives to reanimate dead matter, it\u2019s not because he\u2019s a mad scientist, but because he\u2019s mourning the loss of his beloved mother. When the monster he creates destroys Victor\u2019s family, it\u2019s because the Creature is in turn yearning for Victor\u2019s love. All credit shoud go to Scarlett for the depth with which he\u2019s read Shelley\u2019s novel, and for the ambitiousness with which he\u2019s attempted to stage it. This new three-act ballet comes with a commissioned score by Lowell Liebermann and with designs of marvellously gothic invention by John Macfarlane. The front curtain is particularly arresting: a monstrous skull scribbled over with arcane medical annotations.     Scrabbling, breathless agitation \u2026 Federico Bonelli as Victor Frankenstein. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    Yet in his attempt to remain faithful to Shelly\u2019s novel, Scarlett has also fallen into the trap of being over-literal. Most of his long first act is wasted on swathes of very ordinary dance exposition, as he fills in the backstory of Victor\u2019s love for Elizabeth, and introduces the members of his household. Amid the merry servants and domestic bustle, Scarlett fails to bring into focus the only two characters who matter, Victor and Elizabeth. Although beautifully danced by Federico Bonelli and Laura Morera, their choreography remains too generic \u2013 reminiscent of too many other lovers in the repertoire.  We only start to see what a potent, strange ballet this Frankenstein might be when it shifts to the anatomy theatre. Liebermann\u2019s music, hitherto unmemorable, comes alive with strafing strings and nervy percussion. As Victor and his fellow students participate in a corpse dissection, Scarlett\u2019s witty, visceral choreography concentrates horror with banality. And if the tavern scene that follows is redundant, the Creature\u2019s animation scene is fabulous. A solo of scrabbling, breathless agitation conveys Victor\u2019s terrified excitement, and Macfarlane creates a moment of total theatre in the clamorously sparking \u201cgalvanising machine\u201d and the appearance of the Creature \u2013 a bare, forked Gollum, criss-crossed with raw and bloody seams.    Scarlett animates the Creature with a language of lurching, limp creepiness, latent with demonic power    It\u2019s the Creature who dominates the rest of the ballet, but there should be much more of him. Scarlett animates him with a language of lurching, limp creepiness, latent with demonic power, and Steven McRae\u2019s performance is masterly. Stalking Victor and his little brother (the beguiling Guillem Cabrera Espinach), he\u2019s both a figure of pathos and your worst nightmare. But Scarlett doesn\u2019t give enough weight to the doomed relationship with Victor, not to the bewilderment and hurt that goad the Creature to his final killing spree.     Masterly performance \u2026 McCrae as the Creature with Guillem Cabrera Espinach as William Frankenstein. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    The last act features the ballet\u2019s most beautiful choreography, in the gliding, hallucinatory wedding duet for Victor and Elizabeth; the device of having the Creature slipping sinisterly between the wedding guests is expertly handled. But the murderous denouement and Victor\u2019s anguished suicide feel cursory. There\u2019s a very powerful work at the heart of this ballet, yet Scarlett needs to cut and cut again to set it free. And given the amount of money that was spent on the production, the Royal should insist that he does.  In rep at the Royal Opera House, London, until 27 May. Box office: 020-7304 4000. Screened to cinemas nationwide on 18 May.",
