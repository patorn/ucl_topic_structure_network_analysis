  "body": "One day after suffering terrible disappointment in the year\u2019s first Classic Aidan O\u2019Brien was back on history-making form with a 1-2-3 in the 1,000 Guineas. The race was thoroughly dominated by Minding, whose three-and-a-half-lengths success was so impressive as to prompt a certain amount of Derby chatter for the filly. That emanated from the bookmaking fraternity rather than from O\u2019Brien or Minding\u2019s owners at Coolmore. But in some eyes it will increase the credibility of the Derby talk that the first man to offer a quote, 5-2 \u201cwith a run\u201d, was Mike Dillon of Ladbrokes who has longstanding connections with the Coolmore partners. This was a big moment for O\u2019Brien, who was winning his 250th Group One race. Saddling the first three in a British Classic is not unprecedented but it has not been done in the modern era, not since Alec Taylor Jr in the 1918 St Leger, according to the Racing Post\u2019s John Randall, who is authoritative on such matters. As ever, when asked about those achievements, O\u2019Brien deflected the credit to his staff and his employers. For himself, he expressed mainly relief after Saturday\u2019s flop by Air Force Blue, a dismal 12th of 13 in the 2,000 Guineas. Laughing in the winner\u2019s enclosure here, the trainer said: \u201cListen, I suppose I couldn\u2019t destroy them all.\u201d Instinctively he seemed to expect that Minding would be aimed at the Irish 1,000 Guineas in three weeks\u2019 time on her way to the Oaks at Epsom 12 days later. \u201cObviously the lads will talk about that but all those things are open to her. I suppose they\u2019re going to talk about it and see what everyone wants to do.\u201d For anyone who would like to see her in the Derby, it is at least encouraging that O\u2019Brien did not recoil in horror when asked about the idea. Instead he pleaded for time, pointing to the large number of horses he will run in Derby trials over the coming fortnight, most notably US Army Ranger in Thursday\u2019s Chester Vase. \u201cListen, we\u2019ve plenty happening the next couple of weeks, so that\u2019ll sort it, tell us an awful lot.\u201d Running a filly in the Derby is not something O\u2019Brien would do lightly, given that he would much rather win the race with a colt. As one member of his entourage said here: \u201cEven if she can win the Derby, she can\u2019t be a stallion.\u201d But there is a suggestion that he wanted to run Found in last year\u2019s Epsom race, when his colts were not up to his usual standard, and that he now regrets not having done so. Found ended her year by beating the Derby winner at the Breeders\u2019 Cup.   Related: Frankie Dettori triumphs on Galileo Gold in Newmarket\u2019s 2,000 Guineas    Another element to the decision is that O\u2019Brien has another strong Oaks candidate in Ballydoyle, the runner-up here after a bumping match with Midweek two furlongs out. While Minding is 11-10 for the Oaks, Ballydoyle is third in the betting on 8-1. Alice Springs, the third home behind Minding, is now likely to go for the French Guineas in a fortnight\u2019s time. Ryan Moore, who did the steering on Minding, was winning the 1,000 Guineas for the third time in five years. He was emphatic in his praise for the filly, saying: \u201cShe\u2019s out on her own, really. She\u2019s just faster than them and stays better than them. We were going very comfortably and had them all in trouble at halfway.\u201d Reflecting on Air Force Blue, O\u2019Brien said he had been worried that the horse could not stay this mile after showing so much speed in his work at home. It remains possible that he will get another chance at a mile in the Irish Guineas, but a step back in distance to sprint races seems a distinct possibility. O\u2019Brien will now change the colt\u2019s training regime, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve found out what doesn\u2019t work with him. Now we\u2019ve got to find out what works. It\u2019s always a dangerous time, coming from two-years-old to three and straight into a Classic without a run, because really you\u2019re in the dark.\u201d Such thoughts may also be in the mind of Mark Johnston, whose Lumiere was the disappointment of the 1,000 Guineas, dropping out to be last after setting the pace. Her jockey, William Buick, got a three-day suspension for failing to keep straight from the stalls and causing interference as he went straight to the stands\u2019 rail.",
