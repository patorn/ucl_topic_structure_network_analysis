Related: Japanese vagina kayak artist found guilty of obscenity    Hours earlier, the 64-year old put on her face mask, fins and wetsuit, took a deep breath and propelled herself into the depths in search of lunch. She is one of a dwindling number of ama \u2013 female divers who eschew breathing apparatus as they scour the seabed up to ten metres down for shellfish, seaweed and the occasional octopus and lobster. With their way of life under pressure from falling seafood stocks and waning interest among younger women, Nakamura and her fellow divers are hoping that this week\u2019s G7 summit in nearby Ise-Shima will boost the campaign to prevent their profession becoming a cultural relic. Akie Abe, the wife of Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe, is hoping to take leaders\u2019 spouses to watch a demonstration by ama divers, whom she has described as the embodiment of \u201cJapanese values\u201d.

Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    In a column in the Mainichi Shimbun, Abe said she was impressed by the divers\u2019 commitment to sustainable fishing \u201cby setting areas where they can catch seafood and self-regulating the way they fish through the ages\u201d. Local officials said they would use the summit to push the Japanese government to approve its bid for Unesco to put ama diving culture on its intangible cultural heritage list. Nakamura said she understood why her daughter, who is in her 20s with children of her own, had decided not to follow in her mother\u2019s footsteps. \u201cThere are times when even I don\u2019t feel like diving, when there\u2019s a really cold wind or the sea is rough,\u201d she said. \u201cBut young women don\u2019t want to do this job any more, so that\u2019s why I carry on.\u201d Just after the second world war, Japan was home to about 10,000 ama \u2013 literally, women of the sea \u2013 with 6,000 of them concentrated on the coast of the Shima peninsula, where Barack Obama and other G7 leaders will meet for two days of talks in late May. By 2014, the number of ama had plummeted to about 2,000 nationwide, with 750 or so in the Shima region. Nakamura\u2019s grandmother was one of about 600 divers in Osatsu, where the average age of the 100 or so remaining divers is 65. The oldest is in her mid-80s.   Osatsu locator   \u201cMost women retire in their 70s,\u201d said Takuya Agata, curator at the Toba sea-folk museum. \u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time, I think there will be about half the number of divers there are now.\u201d The failure of attempts to nurture a new generation of divers, including attracting younger women from other parts of Japan, means the end could be drawing near for a tradition dating back 3,000 years. Chisels and other diving tools were excavated from the J\u014dmon era (14,000BC\u2013300BC) ruins on the Shima peninsula, while the first reference to ama appears in Man\u2019yoshu, an eighth-century collection of poetry. The first images of the women, naked from the waist up, appeared in 18th-century ukiyo-e prints. They did not start covering up in white cotton clothing until the early 1900s, and have used wetsuits since the 1960s. Most of the women can recall at least one dive that they were convinced would be their last. For Nakamura, it came one morning three years ago, when the rope attached to her waist became snagged on a rock, bringing her ascent to a halt inches beneath the surface. \u201cEvery time a wave passed I looked to the sky and gasped for air before going under again,\u201d she said. \u201cAfterwards, I went to the shrine and prayed that it would never happen again, but I can feel myself panicking even now thinking about it.\u201d Not surprisingly, ama culture is steeped in superstition. The five-pointed star \u2013 or seiman \u2013 a talismanic design that appears on the ama\u2019s headscarves and tools, is written in a single stroke, starting and ending at the same point, to symbolise a safe return to the surface. An accompanying lattice-design dohman symbol is meant to keep out danger. Before each dive, the women knock on the side of the boat or wooden bucket with their chisel, and recite a short mantra.

Few young women are interested in becoming free divers, while overfishing and global warming have eaten into stocks of their most prized catch, abalone, which sell for as much as 8,000 yen (\u00a350) a kilo. \u201cI remember a time when you\u2019d be stepping on abalone, there were so many of them,\u201d said Nakamura. \u201cNow, if you find a good spot you can come up with about 12kg in a session.\u201d Multiple dives of just under a minute \u2013 what the ama call their \u201c50-second battle\u201d \u2013 also take a toll on their health: surveys show that many of the women, who lose up to 10kg in weight during a typical season, experience hearing problems later in life. Some ama, like Nakamura, dive in groups, with each diver attached by a rope to a wooden bucket that also acts as a float. Those who dive deeper work with their fishermen husbands, who remain on the boat and haul their wives from the depths after each dive. No one is certain why women, rather than their husbands, took on the role of free diver. One explanation is that women generally have more subcutaneous fat and can tolerate cold water for longer periods; another theory is that fishing close to the shoreline seemed a natural job for women while their husbands ventured offshore in their boats. During their heyday after the war, the ama were something of an aberration in what was a largely patriarchal society. Orie Iwasaki, of the local tourism association, said: \u201cWomen had very few rights back then, but in this world they were seen as strong, and a match for their husbands.\u201d     A woman prays at Ishigami-san, a Shinto shrine in Osatsu where ama divers pray for protection against accidents. Photograph: Justin McCurry for the Guardian    Nakamura, who has been an ama since she was 20, has no immediate plans to retire, despite spending all but a few weeks of the year ready to go out to sea as soon as she hears the village siren \u2013 confirmation that conditions are good enough to dive. \u201cAll being well, I\u2019ll keep diving until I\u2019m in my 70s,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re underwater, you feel in charge of your own destiny. I defy anyone to come here on a beautiful day and not feel like jumping into the sea. \u201cIf you love the ocean as much as I do, there are times when this feels like the best job in the world.\u201d",
