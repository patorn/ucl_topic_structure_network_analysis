  "body": "A man accused of murdering his six-year-old daughter in a violent outburst has said she probably died because he failed to take her to hospital after a fall weeks before her death. Ben Butler, 36, told jurors, that his daughter Ellie may have suffered a delayed reaction to concussion she incurred four weeks before her fatal collapse. He had previously told jurors that in the first incident she fell over the family\u2019s new puppy while playing upstairs in their home in Sutton, south London. She was concussed and unresponsive. But he picked her up, put a bag of frozen peas on her head where she had been hit, and she seemed to recover. He accepted he should have got her checked out at hospital. \u201cBy not taking her to hospital in this event is probably the reason why she is not around today. I paid the ultimate price, Ellie paid the price. I blame myself every day,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI accept I let her down. A hundred percent let her down.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m guilty \u2026 It\u2019s probably my fault Ellie isn\u2019t here any more,\u201d he said. The court has heard that Butler was convicted in 2007 for assaulting the girl but that conviction was overturned in the court of appeal. Butler, and his partner, who has been charged with child cruelty, did not get Ellie back from foster care with her grandfather until 2012. Butler has strenuously denied murdering Ellie and says he \u201cpanicked\u201d when he went upstairs on 28 October 2013 and found her on the floor unconscious. Prosecutor Ed Brown, QC, accusing him of lying about her death and doing everything \u201cto save his own skin\u201d. \u201cWhen you first found Ellie, on your account there must have been a chance that she was either alive or recoverable,\u201d he said, asking why Butler did not try and revive her or pick her up. \u201cI just panicked. [It] took all the air out of my lungs, I was shaking,\u201d he said. Earlier in proceedings, Butler had compared his fight for justice to the plight of the Hillsborough families. Butler told the Old Bailey jury his trial was a repeat of a miscarriage of justice he suffered in 2007 when he was arrested and subsequently jailed for assaulting then seven-week-old Ellie. After the prosecutor accused him of deflecting all the blame for Ellie\u2019s death away from the evidence and on to anyone but himself, Butler told jurors: \u201cI was watching the Hillsborough thing the other night.\u201d He was referring to a BBC documentary on the football stadium disaster in which 96 people lost their lives. \u201cThe families in it [the documentary], they were fighting for justice just like we were, and a lady came on and said, \u2018The problem you don\u2019t see is the ripple effect and that one action has on everyone\u2019s life,\u2019\u201d said Butler. \u201cThat 2007 [injury to Ellie] had a ripple effect on everyone\u2019s lives,\u201d he told jurors. Ellie died when she was at home with Butler in October 2013, while her mother was at work. A postmortem showed that she had a fracture almost the entire length of her skull with injuries likened by experts to those in a high-speed car crash. Butler has told jurors it was an accident and admitted covering up her death up by not calling an ambulance for another two hours after he discovered her unconscious. He said he had suffered \u201cunbelievable loss and pain\u201d and that at times he \u201chated\u201d his partner, Jennie Gray, because of the illness she suffered as a direct consequence of the miscarriage of justice and the absence of Ellie from their lives. \u201cThere were times I\u2019m having to pick her up off the floor every day because she\u2019s drunk and drinking, she\u2019s trying to kill herself \u2026 putting pills in her mouth and me trying to get them out,\u201d he said. Under cross-examination Butler admitted to past violence including assaulting a man in a kebab shop in 2004. He also accepted a caution for hitting his ex-girlfriend in 2005 but told jurors on Wednesday that she had \u201cwalloped him harder than any man ever did\u201d. He denied concocting \u201ca sophisticated charade\u201d on the day Ellie died. Butler denies murder. He and Gray deny another charge of child cruelty relating to an allegedly untreated broken shoulder that was discovered in Ellie\u2019s postmortem.",
