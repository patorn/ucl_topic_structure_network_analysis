Asked if the trip might be seen as an apology, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, replied: \u201cIf people do interpret it that way, they\u2019ll be interpreting it wrongly.\u201d Earnest declined to comment on the morality of America\u2019s decision to drop the atomic bomb, for which there have been calls for the country to apologise. He said: \u201cThe president intends to visit to send a much more forward-looking signal for his ambition of realising the goal of a planet without nuclear weapons.\u201d Confirming Obama\u2019s visit in a statement earlier on Tuesday, the White House said it would \u201chighlight [Obama\u2019s] continued commitment to pursuing peace and security in a world without nuclear weapons\u201d.  Earnest acknowledged that the US bore a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d for the bombing of Hiroshima but was also quick to pay tribute to the \u201cgreatest generation\u201d who fought in the second world war. \u201cThere are a lot of people with a lot of opinions about this trip,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe president will have an opportunity to visit the peace park and offer up his own reflections about his visit to that city.\u201d Earnest added: \u201cThe president certainly does understand the United States bears a special responsibility. The United States continues to be the only country to have used nuclear weapons. It means our country bears a special responsibility to lead the world in eliminating them. \u201cThere\u2019s also no diminishing the important contribution of the greatest generation of Americans who didn\u2019t just save the United States, but saved the world, from tyranny.\u201d Obama will also \u201chighlight the remarkable transformation\u201d in relations between the US and Japan, he said. Seventy years ago, \u201cit would have been very difficult to imagine given the hostility between our two countries\u201d. Earnest\u2019s point was reiterated by the national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, on Tuesday. \u201c[Obama] will not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb at the end of World War II,\u201d Rhodes wrote in a post on Medium. \u201cThis visit will offer an opportunity to honor the memory of all innocents who were lost during the war.\u201d Rhodes added that the visit would aid the reconciliation between the US and Japan and support thecountries\u2019 mutual commitment to reducing the \u201cthe role of nuclear weapons in our security and in the policies of other global powers\u201d.

It reminds everybody of the extraordinary complexity of choices in war and of what war does to people, to communities, to countries, to the world,\u201d he said. Kerry laid a wreath at the cenotaph and described his tour of the nearby peace memorial museum as \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d. His visit was well-received in Japan, where many bomb survivors have dropped demands for an apology, hoping instead that a presidential visit would spur future US administrations to push harder for nuclear disarmament. Obama said during a visit to Japan in late 2009 that he would be \u201chonoured\u201d to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which was also bombed as part of the US plan to end the war without a devastating invasion. \u201cI certainly would be honoured \u2013 it would be meaningful for me to visit those two cities in the future,\u201d Obama said during his 2009 trip. Jimmy Carter visited the atomic bomb memorial in Hiroshima in 1984, after he had left office. The highest-ranking US official to visit the site before Kerry was Nancy Pelosi, then the House speaker, in 2008. The US ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, attended a commemoration of the Hiroshima attack\u2019s 70th anniversary last year. Japanese officials had made it clear that they would welcome Obama\u2019s presence at the cenotaph, which includes the names of every person to have died in connection with the bombing. Earlier this year, the mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui, said he believed a visit by Obama would strengthen the campaign for nuclear disarmament. \u201cAn Obama visit would certainly carry a lot of weight,\u201d he said. Survivors of the attack have also encouraged Obama to see for himself the scale of the destruction at the peace museum, as well as the transformation the city has undergone over the past 70 years. Sunao Tsuboi, 91, the head of a survivors\u2019 group, welcomed the decision on Japan\u2019s NHK national television. \u201cWe are not asking for an apology,\u201d Tsuboi said. \u201cAll we want is to see him lay flowers at the peace park and lower his head in silence. This would be a first step toward abolishing nuclear weapons.\u201d",
