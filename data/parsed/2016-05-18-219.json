  "body": "Few film-makers are quite such veterans of the Cannes film festival as Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the Belgium brothers who have won the Palme d\u2019Or twice and premiered almost all their films on the Croisette.  Their latest offering, The Unknown Girl, is about a young doctor, Jenny (Ad\u00e8le Haenel), who tries to discover the identity \u2013 and the killer \u2013 of a woman murdered outside her practice one night. Jenny is motivated both by her own guilt in failing to open the door to the girl, who buzzed an hour after closing time, shortly before her death, and by a growing anger at the apparent apathy of those around her. It is the directors\u2019 third film in a row to feature a female protagonist; like Marion Cotillard\u2019s character in Two Days, One Night and C\u00e9cile de France\u2019s in The Kid with a Bike, Jenny seizes the moral high ground as others flake and flinch in the sight of suffering.    Related: The Unknown Girl review \u2013 a marginal, passionless offering from the Dardennes brothers    This was no accident, said Luc Dardenne, also who was also responding to a question about the decision to make one of the detectives Moroccan. \u201cMaybe Muslim women; women [in general] are the future of society, I truly believe that.\u201d He continued by drawing a parallel between how women react to injustice, compared to men. \u201cThey feel responsible and they are free and make a society move forward.\u201d The younger Dardenne brother also confirmed that the film could be interpreted as a commentary on a contemporary lack of collective responsibility towards migrants in Europe (the murdered girl is a sex worker with a fake passport).  \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re saying,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are interested in Dr Jenny and she feels responsible whereas nobody else does. She didn\u2019t open the door and she should have even if it was well beyond opening hours. Dr Jenny actually triggers the fact that everyone else ends up telling the truth and confesses their part in the death of this girl.\u201d Yet both men were also keen to stress that they didn\u2019t intend the film as a reprimand, or to overtly campaign for any particular course of action.      The directors and star at the press conference. Photograph: Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters    \u201cWhen you make a film it belongs to the spectator,\u201d said Jean-Pierre. \u201cWe\u2019re not upholding a message; we\u2019re interested in Dr Jenny and she is someone who feels responsible and compelled to do something. We\u2019re not saying that is what one should do. We\u2019re not trying to defend any given stance.\u201d Jean-Pierre also resisted any parallels between the murdered girl and the bombers in the recent attacks in Paris and Brussels. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should try to make general statements and extrapolate to talk about immigration.\u201d  The key link, he suggested, was that \u201chorrible images of the dead\u201d made him and his brother all the more eager to make films which are \u201ca hymn to life\u201d.  Their star echoed the sentiment, saying: \u201cThere are no real monsters. I think we inhibit part of our very human selves because we live in cities, where we\u2019re constantly faced with human misery \u2013 and so we can\u2019t face it.\u201d Haenel continued by saying she believes that as we progress through life, so our capacity for compassion can be curtailed, and that the film illustrates a way of overcoming that.  The brothers also revealed the key to their long-standing collaboration. \u201cThere is no secret,\u201d said Jean-Pierre. \u201cWe\u2019re just one person. It doesn\u2019t look like it because we\u2019re two physical people. But we are one.\u201d",
