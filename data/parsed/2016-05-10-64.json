  "body": "Jailed Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy filed a lawsuit against Barack Obama, challenging his placement in solitary confinement and seeking to dismiss the federal government\u2019s felony charges that could condemn him to die behind bars.  The suit from the rancher, who led a high-profile standoff against the government in 2014, also names US judge Gloria Navarro and Nevada senator Harry Reid.    Related: Another Bundy standoff possible as groups call for US to seize livestock    The complaint, filed Tuesday, offers a defense of the 70 year old\u2019s infamous comment that black people may have been \u201cbetter off as slaves, picking cotton\u201d and slams Obama for \u201cdespicable disrespectful mocking\u201d of Bundy at the 2014 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. The lawsuit comes as Bundy faces numerous federal charges stemming from the April 2014 showdown at his property when authorities tried unsuccessfully to seize his cattle and faced off with hundreds of supporters, some heavily armed, who defended the family\u2019s ranch in Bunkerville, about 80 miles north-east of Las Vegas. For more than 20 years, Bundy had refused to pay grazing fees to the federal government, arguing that the US Bureau of Land Management had no authority to regulate ranchers and that his cattle should be able to roam freely on public lands. The activist, who has become the unofficial leader of the land-use rights movement in the American west, avoided consequences for years until he was taken into custody in February. Bundy, along with four of his sons and a dozen activists, now faces charges of conspiring against the US, assaulting and threatening law enforcement, using firearms to commit violence, and interference with interstate commerce by extortion. The lawsuit from Bundy \u2013 who has been denied bail and remains incarcerated as he awaits trial, is scheduled for February 2017 and accuses the government of \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d for locking him in solitary confinement. It also says officials have violated his free-speech rights, his freedom of religion, his second amendment rights and his right to a speedy trial. The complaint outlines a series of alleged conflicts of interest and says the government has unlawfully targeted the Bundy men and \u201cpeaceful persons who were rightly armed and defended by peaceful cowboys and militias\u201d. The suit calls for Navarro to be removed as the judge in the Bundy case, noting that Reid recommended her for an appointment and Obama nominated her \u2013 and both Reid and Obama have publicly made negative comments about Bundy. Reid has called Bundy\u2019s supporters \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d and recently said he wanted to push for a national conservation area by the family\u2019s ranch, now that the Bundy men are incarcerated. Obama briefly alluded to Bundy in his 2014 speech, saying, \u201cLet me tell you something I know about the Negro\u201d \u2013 a reference to Bundy\u2019s controversial remarks on race.   Related: Ammon Bundy is an 'originalist' just like Antonin Scalia, says defense    The suit defends the comments, saying Bundy was publicly equating his family\u2019s situation to the \u201c\u2018the plight of \u2018Negroes\u2019 in the old South, whereby they were enslaved by a tyrannical government\u201d. The complaint continues, \u201cHe chose the word \u2018Negro\u2019 believing that this was a proper term for African Americans, having looked up the word in Webster\u2019s dictionary. He meant no disrespect and insult to African Americans \u2026 Indeed, the Reverend Martin Luther King referred to his people as \u2018Negroes\u2019 and he is recognized as the greatest African American civil rights leader in American history.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t normally sue judges,\u201d Joel Hansen, Bundy\u2019s attorney, said in an interview on Monday night. \u201cI respect judges, and I think they have a right to make their decisions, but these judges are not listening to us, and they\u2019re leaving Cliven in solitary confinement for no reason whatsoever.\u201d The isolation is affecting Bundy, his attorney said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting him depressed. He never sees the sun. Here is a rancher who spent his whole life outdoors \u2026 and now he is confined in a box.\u201d Kristen Orthman, spokeswoman for Reid, slammed the lawsuit and the Bundys in an email.  \u201cIt is hardly surprising that Cliven Bundy, a man who has been breaking federal law for decades, would file a baseless and absurd lawsuit. Bundy, his sons and their believers have endangered the lives of federal officers, have defaced and damaged public lands and squandered public resources for their own benefit. They are domestic terrorists. They are deadly and dangerous and will be brought to justice.\u201d Spokespeople for Navarro and Obama did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
