  "body": "Sam Allardyce is full of surprises and on the eve of Sunderland\u2019s home game against Chelsea he revealed that transcendental meditation has become a key weapon in his battle to keep the Wearsiders in the Premier League. The 61-year-old is a long-standing advocate of psychology and sports science but for quite some time has also relied on a relaxation technique originally imported from India. \u201cI do transcendental meditation and I have done it for 12 years now, ever since I was introduced to the person who took me through the ritual process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very relaxing, very calming and you can do it anywhere. \u201cIt helps you cope with the pressure you come under in this job. When it was brought in for the players by us at Bolton in about 2003-04, I tried it for myself. It helps you reduce your blood pressure and keeps you calmer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s easy to carry out. Fifteen minutes, half an hour \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be going into a quiet room with music on or anything like that. You can be anywhere at any time, as long as you find a relatively quiet place, doing 15, 20, 25 minutes. It refreshes you and makes you feel good to push on. It has helped me cope with the pressure of management.\u201d Not that Sunderland\u2019s manager is about to recommend it to Newcastle\u2019s Rafa Ben\u00edtez and Norwich\u2019s Alex Neil, his two counterparts in this season\u2019s relegation fight, or any other manager for that matter. \u201cWhy should I help them,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to them about it because it might make them better when they play against me.   Related: Jermain Defoe\u2019s rescue act draws praise from Sunderland\u2019s Sam Allardyce    \u201cIt\u2019s all about focusing the mind and then chilling out. I typically do it three or four times a week but I\u2019m meditating more now because of our league position. I usually do 20 to 25 minutes when the working day\u2019s finished, sometimes in my office, sometimes away from the club. I\u2019m not a great sleeper but 30 minutes\u2019 mediation is as good as two or three hours\u2019 sleep, so you feel a bit better.\u201d He is yet to introduce Lee Cattermole and company to transcendental meditation though. \u201cMy players are not using it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you want to introduce them to in one season. And not everyone will want to do it. It\u2019s not one of those things you force on anyone.\u201d",
