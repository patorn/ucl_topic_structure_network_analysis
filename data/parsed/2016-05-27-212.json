  "body": "The NHS is showing impressive ingenuity in finding ways round the chaos caused by Andrew Lansley\u2019s reforms, but some of the solutions risk causing a new set of long-term problems. From the structure and role of the regulators to the commissioning of primary care, the NHS has gradually stitched together a tapestry of organisations and processes to do what needs to be done, then backfilled the governance to ensure it stays within the law. The next round of the reforms is dividing the country into 44 sustainability and transformation \u201cfootprints\u201d. NHS England bills them as merely collective discussion forums, but the truth is that they are now seen as central to delivering the Five Year Forward View and making the NHS financial and clinically sustainable.   Related: GPs are leading the way on NHS transformation    With clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) having largely been unequal to the task of driving through the tough decisions needed on restructuring hospital services, the sustainability and transformation plans (STPs) due to be submitted to NHS England and NHS Improvement in June are intended to force answers to difficult local questions. Each footprint has a leader, almost invariably a major figure in health or local government, with the clout to bring all the local players together and force discussions to a conclusion. In an interview with the Health Service Journal, NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens spelt out just how far the central bodies are likely to push this new way of running the NHS. Taking an idea from local government, he sees commissioners and providers pooling sovereignty to form the health service equivalent of combined authorities.  In terms of NHS structure, this is revolutionary. In one go it would lead to a massive consolidation of CCGs and greatly accelerate the erosion of the split between purchasers and providers of care.  Crucially, Stevens has promised an alliance between STP leaders and the national leadership in defeating the \u201cveto power\u201d of individual hospitals in restructuring services. This means that when the sustainability plans are reviewed in July, a whole series of locally contentious service changes could be pushed through simultaneously. The frustration within the national leadership at the inability of local areas to confront festering problems is palpable. In his first few days in the job two years ago, Stevens pointed out that many of the hospitals with the worst problems for clinical quality and financial viability were exactly the same ones that had been in difficulties when he first started as an NHS manager almost 30 years earlier. NHS England and NHS Improvement are right to look for ways to batter through the procrastination of decades, but must be wary of the risks.   Related: Can new regulator NHS Improvement save the health service?    These plans are being developed to tight timescales and the key decisions are being called by the leader for each area. With every week\u2019s delay in restructuring, the NHS digs itself further into a financial hole, and these leaders could be forgiven for thinking that in those circumstances any decision is better than no decision. But there is a risk that STP leaders end up becoming powerbrokers rather than following the evidence of what needs to be done. With muscular foundation trusts vying for hegemony over territories and services, it is tempting to split the difference and railroad through expedient decisions built on flimsy data which give everyone something to take home. Effective systems leadership means building the trust and evidence to argue through to the right conclusion for the local health economy as a whole, not trying to reach a compromise. The NHS will only get one go at this between now and 2020, so it cannot afford to be distracted by institutional or management egos from making the right choices. The STP process has the potential to break the logjam in reconfiguring services. In doing so, great care must be taken not to generate a new set of problems that another generation will still be trying to sort out as 2050 approaches.
