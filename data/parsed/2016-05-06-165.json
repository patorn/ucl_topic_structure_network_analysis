  "body": "From its position sandwiched between two theatres, it\u2019s not hard to figure out whom this new opening is targeting. Owners the Soho House group have captured the movers and shakers with their elitist clubhouses around the globe, and the hipsters lacquering moustaches with meat juices at their dreary Dirty Burger and rather better Chicken Shop. So\u00a0what\u2019s left? Ah, yes: normcore. Cafe Monico looks appealing from\u00a0the top of the 38 bus. In its pleasingly fusty way, you can totally believe it to have once been the haunt of bespectacled intellectuals and phlegmy old thespians. It is, however, brand new. On board as consultant chef is Rowley Leigh, that rarest of creatures, the chefs\u2019 chef: his Kensington Place was at the forefront of the capital\u2019s 80s culinary renaissance, wowing pie-crust-bloused princesses with foie gras and sweetcorn pancakes. (There are shades of his later gig, Le Cafe Anglais, on Cafe Monico\u2019s modern brasserie menu, notably parmesan custard with anchovy toast.) And from our mezzanine eyrie we spy him at the pass, hectoring his brigade. It\u2019s all shaping up nicely, in an unchallenging, middle-aged kind of way. Sadly, the hectoring appears to be falling on deaf ears. The food is fine, but you\u2019ll hunt high and low for a frisson. It\u2019s as crowdpleasing as its surroundings: gravadlax and carbonnade on the set lunch; moules frites, fish and chips, pasta, shellfish and charcuterie on the \u00e0 la carte. There are daily plats and nostalgic winks: devilled lamb\u2019s kidneys, guinea fowl with morels. You\u2019d have to be pretty fussy not to find something up your street, rue, strada. The famous parmesan custard is a\u00a0sad little thing, the toast weaselly and Melba-thin, the under-cheesed custard split into watery curds. French onion soup has admirable quantities of stretchy, melted gruy\u00e8re, but the stock is underpowered and the crouton too fresh, so it disintegrates into a kind of oniony bread sauce. Blades of perky endive are laden with roquefort butter, a nice, Fanny Cradock-esque conceit, but \u2013 and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this \u2013 there\u2019s waaay too much butter, piped on to the leaves in a Rabelaisian, gullet-clogging way. We\u00a0scoop most of it off in search of edibility; it spreads beautifully on to\u00a0the fine baguette. Prawn cocktail is pseudo-American, the prawns dangling over the bowl, the sauce a\u00a0tingly salsa rather than marie rose. Veal, a portion the size of a Post-it and about as thin, comes saltimbocca-style with sage and parma ham. Nice enough, but three chomps and it\u2019s gone. I take a photo with a buttery french bean for scale: the bean looks Brobdingnagian. Frites are fine. Apologies: \u201cfine\u201d and \u201cnice\u201d are all I can give you. Until we\u00a0come to a miserably-sized Dover sole: the flesh is creamy and firm (possibly aged a little?), but its delicate flavour has been annihilated by a thuggish, criss-cross grilling. Blind-tasted, it could be a Big Mac or a beer mat: this is not fine or nice at all.

It\u2019s a wonderfully Google-able name, too: so, no tricks missed. But I\u2019d say the group\u2019s debt is not so much to Giacomo and Battista, but to Chris and Jeremy: it is so clearly a salvo on the lucrative market so beautifully cornered by Messrs Corbin and King of the Wolseley, Bellanger et al. With its leather club chairs, wall lights and wood-panelled mezzanine, it looks like the progeny of the Delaunay and one of the many Ivys currently clambering all over the capital like bindweed. There are bright spots in this celebration of safe: a vintage chandelier of gasp-making beauty that plunges between the two floors to a ground floor bar specialising in intriguing cocktails and a collection of recherch\u00e9 vermouths and bitters. And manager Mariano Camerlingo (ex of the same group\u2019s Dean Street Townhouse), a charming, old school Neapolitan schmoozer. Does Cafe Monico do the job? Absolutely. Does it thrill? Not a chance. But I guess that\u2019s not what it\u2019s setting out to do: it\u2019s a homage to\u00a0a homage, a pastiche of a pastiche. So, in the spirit of the place, I\u2019m going to come over all normcore restaurant critic and declare it a solid addition to the theatreland scene. That\u2019s about as exciting as it gets. \u2022 Cafe Monico 39-45 Shaftesbury Avenue, London W1, 020-3727 6161. Open all week, 8am-midnight (1am Fri & Sat; 9am weekend opening). About \u00a330 a head for three courses \u00e0 la carte, plus drinks and service. Food 5/10 Atmosphere 7/10 Value for money 6/10",
