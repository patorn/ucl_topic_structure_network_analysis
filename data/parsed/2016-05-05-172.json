  "body": "We\u2019re a proudly greedy nation and our food fixation seems nowhere near sated, even with new restaurants mushrooming at a gobsmacking rate. So it\u2019s no shock that according to the Office of National Statistics, there are 21,000 more professional chefs in the UK this year than last, a total of 250,000. But what is unexpected, and unwelcome, is that only 18.5% of them \u2013 some 46,000 \u2013 are women, a decrease on the previous year\u2019s percentage of 20.5%. Yep, an actual decline. It\u2019s surprising when you consider the hospitality industry\u2019s recent efforts to make itself more, well, hospitable to all. This is a modernising profession with more employers working to create teams and nurture talent, give people the time to have relationships outside the kitchen and offer support within it. That might not be industry-wide yet, but it is on the upswing as a generational shift slowly takes place. So if things aren\u2019t really that bad, does the restaurant world have an image problem that is keeping potential candidates away? \u201cThe next generation of chefs and restaurateurs aren\u2019t people who left school at 15, worked as a commis chef in a three [Michelin] star until they\u2019re broken and then perpetuate the same thing in their kitchens,\u201d says Sabrina Gidda, head chef of Italian restaurant Bernardi\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s people who gave up degrees and business and other things to do what they really love.\u201d She agrees that there\u2019s too much focus on the reputed hardships rather than the rewards, whatever your background. \u201cA lot of people all over the world work long hours and, yes, it is hot and can be tough, but the thrill of being in a busy service with your entire brigade absolutely nailing it is unlike anything else.\u201d Gidda is mindful of a distinct lack of diversity and hopes her recent appearance on Saturday Kitchen might encourage young Asian women to consider a career in cooking. \u201cWhere are the young female Indian chefs who want to come through? It\u2019s highly regarded to have culinary aptitude in a domestic sense, but to be a senior chef running a kitchen isn\u2019t. And that\u2019s relevant to me, to make it more acceptable.\u201d     Anna Hansen. Photograph: Alex Lake/The Observer Magazine    Angela Hartnett is one of the nation\u2019s very best chefs and joint owner of five excellent restaurants, three of which have women installed as head chefs. She points out that hospitality is not isolated in its gender-imbalanced staffing. \u201cI find it bizarre that it always comes up, as I don\u2019t think catering is the only industry where there are fewer women. It just seems like everyone hones in on it. I think it\u2019s great to have a balance of genders and a mix of young and old too.\u201d She\u2019s also taken aback at the stats, noting the industry\u2019s improving conditions, support initiatives such as Hospitality Action and more awareness among employers that staff need looking after. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer: create a great environment where the staff food is good and people want to work together. Go into your restaurant, chat to your staff, know their names. It makes a big difference.\u201d Anna Hansen, chef-proprietor of two The Modern Pantry restaurants, also employs a mixed brigade, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hire a female candidate over a better male candidate per se, but I definitely make sure that I\u2019ve got lots of females in the kitchen.\u201d The idea that women might depart to start a family doesn\u2019t daunt her either. \u201cEverybody has to work and if we want the population to grow then, as the child-bearers, women are going to have to continue to have to do it. Everyone is entitled to make a decision and that applies to every career.\u201d She\u2019s also adamant that fostering an inclusive working environment is the best way to keep staff in the business. \u201cGirls do get harassed, so you have to be aware of it. Not that people are inherently negative, but it\u2019s easy to shift a vibe if you\u2019re constantly pecking away at it.\u201d Anna Tobias, head chef at Rochelle Canteen, points out that pieces that discuss gender, including this one, can further isolate women. \u201cThere\u2019s constantly articles about women and tough jobs, which might make people think: \u2018Why are they getting so upset?\u2019 Also, if men aren\u2019t included, it\u2019s not helpful. All of the men I work with are incredible feminists.\u201d But, she allows: \u201cWomen do need better rights and to be viewed with more respect. I just hope it\u2019s an inclusive discussion.\u201d      Rachel Cooke and Nieves Barragan Mohacho at Barrafina. Photograph: Pal Hansen for the Observer    And it needs to involve more than just the profession, it seems, as sexism can come courtesy of customers. \u201cOccasionally they will thank my sous chef as they just assume he\u2019s the head chef. It\u2019s disappointing,\u201d says Tobias. Further proof is provided by Gidda. \u201cWhen we opened Bernardi\u2019s, we must have had 10 or 12 tables over the course of the opening weeks that said: \u2018We really love the food, can we meet the chef as we want to tell him how good it was?\u2019 When I walk up the stairs, they\u2019re like: \u2018OK, that\u2019s not what we were expecting\u2019 and \u2018Are you actually the chef?\u2019 So, it\u2019s not necessarily the industry and the environment, it\u2019s the guests\u2019 perspectives too.\u201d Nieves Barragan Mohacho, executive head chef of the three Barrafina restaurants, also believes that media representation might be partially responsible for the lack of women in the profession. \u201cI think a lot of women would want to come into the kitchens, but I think it has a bad reputation. We need to talk about it more [positively] because it used to be like hell but not any more. Now it\u2019s fun.\u201d Like Gidda, Hartnett, Hansen and Tobias, Barragan believes the key to manifesting a working environment that attracts and retains chefs is treating them as individuals. \u201cWithout them, I\u2019m nothing, so I try to do as much as possible for them to be happy, such as giving them days off when family comes over \u2026 Also, I don\u2019t stick people in one section only, chefs want to learn. These things help.\u201d \u201cI spent three years with no laundry even in my size,\u201d says Rosy Rong, a rising head chef who previously worked at St John, John Salt and Moro. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a physical indication that this is an environment not made for you, try wearing clothes that make you feel like you\u2019re playing dress up.\u201d At new restaurant The Stores Kitchen, Rong is well aware that the industry needs to work on its representation, conditions and image to achieve a truly diverse workforce. Rong echoes the thoughts of every chef included in this piece \u2013 \u201cI hate the caveat, female chef. I\u2019m just a chef!\u201d  Hopefully before too long, this point will no longer need to be made.",
