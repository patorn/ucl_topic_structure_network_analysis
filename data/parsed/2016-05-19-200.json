  "body": "The Guardian is reporting a strong April performance across both print and digital platforms, according to ABC figures out today. The Observer also recorded a robust month - outperforming the quality Sunday market with a 5.3% month-on-month increase in sold copy. The boost in Guardian print sales (up 2.9%) month-on-month, comes as the Guardian spearheaded the expos\u00e9 of the Panama Papers - the biggest leak in history. It\u2019s one of the strongest results for purely sold copy in the quality market and shows that despite a price rise, there is still demand for a premium print product. It is also likely that Independent readers are now choosing to pick up the Guardian for their print fix of news, analysis and features. Particularly strong sales this month were recorded for Panama Papers reporting, coverage of Prince\u2019s death, the Ken Livingstone fall out and the late Victoria Wood. Highlights for The Observer\u2019s April sales include Observer Food Monthly specials on Chinese and Spring recipes.  Guardian 169,424 up 2.9% month-on-month or up 4,794 copies  down 3.8% year-on-year or down 6733 copies The Observer 194,054 up 5.3% month-on-month or up 9802 copies  down 1.2% year-on-year or down 2366 copies The digital performance for April was also a significantly strong month with over 155 million monthly unique browsers - the highest volume since November\u2019s record of 158.5m. It was, however, a record month for daily average unique browsers at 9.29m. Unlike November\u2019s traffic which was driven largely by the external news of the Paris attacks, April\u2019s news agenda was dominated by Guardian instigated stories including the Panama Papers investigation and Jon Ronson\u2019s interview with Monica Lewinsky, (part of \u2018The Web We Want\u2019 series), which attracted readers from all over the world. Digital ABC figures: Monthly unique browsers including off-platform 155,057,531 up 0.02% MoM Daily average unique browsers including off-platform 9,296,081 up 5.33% MoM Monthly page impressions including off-platform 960,576,751 down 0.2% MoM  Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News and Media: \u201cApril\u2019s figures show what the Guardian is all about - world-class journalism that makes a big impact and is expertly executed across both digital and print. Our investigative journalism set the global news agenda and the consequences continue to be felt in numerous governments and institutions. I\u2019m delighted that such groundbreaking and innovative journalism has attracted a huge number of readers.\u201d The Guardian remains the most trusted news source in the UK according to the latest Ofcom report. -Ends-  For more information please contact: media.enquiries@theguardian.com or 020 335 33696 Notes to editors About Guardian News & Media Guardian News & Media (GNM) publishes theguardian.com, one of the largest English-speaking quality newspaper websites in the world.
