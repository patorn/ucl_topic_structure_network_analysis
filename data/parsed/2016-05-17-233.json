  "body": "7pm \u2013 Nadia Reid Please don\u2019t let the Sallis Benney theatre be empty for the opening artist of our four-act showcase. Nadia Reid\u2019s debut album, Listen to Formation, Look for the Signs, bowled over a series of our writers late last year \u2013 Kitty Empire, Laura Barton and me among them \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t just us: whoever heard the album seemed to go into raptures over it. There was very good reason for that \u2013 Reid is a remarkably talent, assured, clever and confident singer-songwriter. Listen to Formation \u2026 wasn\u2019t an album to be placed alongside the sonic adventurers \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t approach it looking for the future direction of urban music \u2013 but it was the work of someone in total command of her songwriting gift. Pretty much everyone who wrote about her invoked a comparison with Laura Marling, and it wasn\u2019t just because they\u2019re both women who know their way around and acoustic guitar; she also shares with Marling a devastating youthful wisdom that gives her songs a feeling of lasting profundity.            8pm \u2013 Meilyr Jones I first encountered Meilyr Jones playing a secret late-night set at last year\u2019s End of the Road festival. A gawky fella, all arms and legs, with a bowlcut and a band who looked as if they would be unlikely to be able to start and finish songs at the same time and in the same key took to the stage. Five minutes later I felt I\u2019d seen some sort of non-confrontational version of Dexy\u2019s Midnight Runners, as the pumping, brassy indie-soul of How to Recognise a Work of Art came to an end. The rest of Jones\u2019s first solo album, 2013 \u2013 inspired by Byron and Berlioz, Rome and heartbreak, is less insistent, but no less lovely. He\u2019s a strangely captivating performer, too. \u201cThings aren\u2019t sexy enough, genuinely sexy. Things aren\u2019t wild enough, things aren\u2019t erotic enough, things aren\u2019t gentle enough, things aren\u2019t light enough, things aren\u2019t fun enough,\u201d he told the Guardian last year. We can\u2019t promise you sexiness, wildness, eroticism, gentleness. But we\u2019re pretty sure this one will be fun.             9pm \u2013 Eska  It had started to look as though Eska Mtungwazi would never get around to bringing her talent to bear in its own right. She had worked with the likes of Grace Jones, Nitin Sawhney, Bobby McFerrin and Courtney Pine; her live shows were reportedly startlingly brilliant affairs \u2013 including one in 2012 with an 80-piece choir backing her \u2013 but there never seemed to be an album, the flag planted at the summit, the thing that secures the legacy. That first, self-titled album finally arrived last year, a dizzying, unpindownable journey across genres. (\u201cWhat genre is Scott Walker in? That\u2019s where I wanna be,\u201d she told the Observer, when asked if it was possible to give her music a genre tag.) That album won a nomination for the Mercury prize, and here\u2019s your chance to see her play an intimate show. Not to be missed.            10pm \u2013 Mmoths A change of pace to round off the evening, in the shape of Mmoths. Mmoths is Jack Colleran, a young Irishman whose debut album, Luneworks, came out a few weeks back. Here\u2019s a man in love with the fuzz of things, the fraying of sound at the point where different musics collide: ambient, electronica, glitch, even a spot of dance music. If the rest of the evening has been songwriters who are, one way or another, traditionalist, Mmoths is not. These are moods, rather than songs. But he\u2019s not an outlier: like Nadia Reid, Meilyr Jones and Eska, Mmoths is the work of an individual vision. Join us on Friday night: we\u2019re looking forward to seeing you.             The Great Escape runs from Thursday 19 May to Saturday 21 May and assorted venues around Brighton. You can find full details here. The Guardian\u2019s stage is at the Sallis Benney theatre, 58-67 Grand Parade, Brighton BN2 0JY, on Friday 20 May.",
