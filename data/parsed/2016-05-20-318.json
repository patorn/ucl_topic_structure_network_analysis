  "body": "They found him in a sort of trance, a happy smile on his face, his eyes still fixed on the dusty wake of their destroyer \u2026 \u201cGlorious, stirring sight!\u201d murmured Toad, never offering to move. \u201cThe poetry of motion! The real way to travel! The only way to travel!\u2019\u201d And that, to quote the great motoring authority of Toad Hall, is roughly how I feel about the impending death of driving. It has to happen, obviously. Just as Mr Toad had to be relieved of the keys before he flattened every living thing in Wind in the Willows, so human nature had made the advent of driverless cars pretty much inevitable even before this week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech promised measures to build a market for them.    Getting the keys to a car opened up a world of places, people and things    We\u2019d be idiots to refuse the promise of a world where pedestrians almost never have to die and car crashes are as rare as hen\u2019s teeth, because there are no dumb or drunk or distracted humans thundering past at 50mph not looking. A world where cycling could become so safe it was actually relaxing again, and traffic jams untangled themselves, and pollution didn\u2019t choke cities to death after all. Sooner or later driverless cars will find their place in human lives, just like all the other things humans never thought would catch on. That\u2019s progress. But my God, driving was fun while it lasted. Just to be clear, I\u2019m no petrolhead. Marriage to someone who comes alive at the whiff of an oily rag has pretty much confirmed that. Even after two decades of my husband gamely trying and failing to interest me in cars, I can still barely tell an Aston Martin from a Honda Civic \u2013 and I only know the latter exists because, honestly, how brilliant is it that someone named a car after the exhilarating world of local government? For a while when we lived in London I didn\u2019t even own a car and happily took the tube or the bus pretty much everywhere. I\u2019m hotly anticipating the return of Top Gear only because it\u2019s such a fascinating insight into male bonding and the mid-life crisis (if anything, the car stuff tends to get in the way of the real drama for me). But I bloody love driving, all the same; love everything about it.     \u2018Toad was never so much in love with a machine as with progress, the thrill of the new and improved.\u2019 Matthew Hart plays the part of Toad in a production of The Wind in the Willows. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    It must have started while growing up in the middle of rural nowhere, where the real rite of passage wasn\u2019t turning 18 \u2013 we\u2019d all been drinking for years anyway \u2013 but turning 17 and starting driving lessons. Getting the keys to a car opened up a world of places, people and things not to be found in an Essex village in the 80s. Independence, that was the thing. Driving spelled escape, that first intoxicating understanding that you don\u2019t have to rely on other people \u2013 parents, the boyfriend with a car \u2013 but can do your own thing. \u201cHere today, in next week tomorrow! Villages skipped, towns and cities jumped \u2013 always somebody else\u2019s horizon!\u201d as Toad says. Even now, when driving is less about having the wind in your hair than about school runs and supermarket trips, the ghost of that feeling lingers. It\u2019s the real reason so many of us make terrible passengers, sniping about speed limits, always secretly itching to grab the wheel. To drive is to be free, in charge, a grownup \u2013 which must be why a certain kind of man clings stubbornly to the notion that he should always drive and she should map-read. Is the endless aggro that cab drivers get from some passengers really just a desperate attempt to overcompensate for the impotence of the backseat, to assert superiority \u2013 if only by nitpicking about whether this really is the fastest route to the station? At least driverless cars will be impervious to being sworn at, I suppose. But imagine the frustration of alpha types when they\u2019re running late and the car refuses to step on it. Driving isn\u2019t just about power, though. There\u2019s something terribly comforting about the smooth unfolding of a routine performed so often \u2013 the balancing of clutch against accelerator, the reflex glance in the mirror \u2013 and for so long that it\u2019s in your bones. Like anything rhythmic and absorbing, driving can unlock the ability to think. There\u2019s just enough going on to occupy the shallows of the mind, but not enough to stop the deeper realms from working. And as anyone who has ever driven a howling baby round and round darkened streets until it magically fell asleep knows, there\u2019s definitely a bit of self-soothing for adults going on here. The swoop and sway of a car in motion, the road ribboning endlessly away into darkness \u2013 come on, who are we kidding? Like smoking, which is essentially a socially acceptable way for grown adults to carry on sucking dummies, driving secretly satisfies both the baby and the adult in us. The irony is, of course, that it will probably be life\u2019s Mr Toads who find it easiest to leave all this behind. Toad was never so much in love with a machine as with progress, the thrill of the new and improved; he was equally besotted with his Gypsy caravan until he first clapped eyes on the motor car, and would doubtless have bitten Google\u2019s arm off for the next big thing had it existed in Kenneth Grahame\u2019s lifetime.

We're living in the motorised middle ages | Martin Belam    But it\u2019s hard to believe smart cars will ever completely kill old-fashioned human driving for the rest of us, any more than digital music did vinyl. So perhaps we\u2019ll simply learn to separate driving for pleasure from the boring old business of getting-from-A-to-B. We might start treating our knackered old Nissans more like those classic cars that hobbyists spend long nights reverentially restoring in order to drive them very slowly, while wearing special gloves, to country pubs at weekends. Or perhaps \u201cdumb cars\u201d will be, like the horse-drawn carriage in which the Queen arrived at parliament to pronounce upon the future, reserved strictly for ceremonial occasions. Weddings maybe, and certainly funerals. Who would send a loved one on their last journey by lonely, driverless hearse? But then again perhaps change will just come so slowly and incrementally, via ever-more intelligent braking systems and satnavs and the creeping automation of small tasks nobody really minds relinquishing, that we\u2019ll barely even realise driving is dying out. And Toad\u2019s beloved destroyer will become just another of those things you only see clearly in the rear-view mirror, as it vanishes slowly from sight.",
