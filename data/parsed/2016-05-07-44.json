  "body": "A slight, 23-year-old British woman emerged before a crowd of several thousand spectators in Chongqing, China, to perform as the final competitor in a event that has flown largely under the radar of the sports pages. Above her, on an overhanging construction of plywood 20 feet high, were a series of holds \u2013 plastic protuberances in salmon pink and fluorescent yellow \u2013 which Shauna Coxsey was required to climb. One move held her up for a moment but on her third attempt she made it, with a spectacular feet-free sideways leap, one hand grabbing for a tiny hold. Her legs, following and barely under control, threatened to pull her off, but somehow she managed to hold on. It was Coxsey\u2019s fourth World Cup victory in a row \u2013 and the third in this current championship \u2013 in competition climbing, a sport she has dominated this year and which is shortlisted for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Watching last week\u2019s competition in Chongqing, it is not hard to see why the International Olympic Committee is interested. The wild leaps and improbable and tenuous movements, the falls and attempts against the clock, make for dramatic viewing. And for the rapidly emerging star of the British competition climbing team, it is all the more extraordinary, given that Coxsey won her first World Cup round in Munich last year when she was below peak fitness, after coming back from a persistent finger injury that had made climbing almost too painful. Coxsey, from Runcorn, Cheshire, specialises in the discipline of bouldering \u2013 one of three competition climbing events, the others being roped lead climbing and speed climbing. In bouldering, competitors must master four short and highly gymnastic climbs, unroped but above padded mats, in the shortest number of attempts in four or five minutes, ideally on the first go. In quick order Coxsey has dominated the first three rounds of the World Cup in Switzerland, Japan and China, placing her as an early favourite.         IFSC climbing world cup in Chongqing in May.    Her recent run of victories has seen her rapidly transformed into one of the most recognisable figures in competition climbing, a scene bolstered by the explosion in indoor climbing walls in Britain. Briefly back in the UK before travelling to India and the United States for the next rounds, Coxsey has suddenly been forced to deal with a new level of attention in this growing sport. \u201cI spent all of last season with a finger injury,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cThat was really challenging and draining. I was away in the summer with my boyfriend in South Africa and things had got so bad I didn\u2019t want to go climbing. My body wanted a break. It was a hard decision to go to the last competition in Munich. \u201cI had a chance of being on the podium, but I decided I would only go if I could give everything, even though I knew I was not at my fittest. Winning that round taught me so much about being an athlete.\u201d And that unexpected victory has acted as a springboard for her string of victories this season. Bouldering requires a series of skills, including the ability to see and solve a sequence of holds under pressure, and then the strength and flexibility to perform often very physically demanding and highly gymnastic sequences. It is made doubly difficult by the fact that climbers are held in isolation as others compete, unable to see the course but able to hear the audience\u2019s reactions. \u201cYou compete in reverse order,\u201d Coxsey said. \u201cBecause I am ranked first that means that I climb last, which can be quite challenging when it is coming to your turn. You can\u2019t see anything but can hear everything, especially if the commentary is in English.\u201d In China, indeed, the reaction of an audience unfamiliar with the sport \u2013 cheering when climbers fell, not when they succeeded \u2013 made it more confounding. \u201cI almost don\u2019t see it as competing against others. I\u2019m not going out to beat anyone. I\u2019m competing against myself to solve the problem.\u201d For Coxsey, who trains 40 hours a week, it is the culmination of an involvement with climbing that began when she was four years old. \u201cI train six days a week, splitting my time between Liverpool and Sheffield,\u201d she said. Half of that time is spent on climbing walls, while other training focuses on core strength or on sessions on a wooden finger board, where climbers, sometimes weighted, hang on with their feet hanging free to train their grip strength. She has been surprised at the response to her recent wins, not least through social media and email. \u201cI\u2019ve been competing for quite a few years and had a lot of support, but this has been a whole new level. It\u2019s quite overwhelming. But I feel honoured that I can inspire people and get them to pick up their climbing shoes and find that passion.\u201d One of the founders of the Women\u2019s Climbing Symposium, Coxsey has witnessed a striking change in women\u2019s participation in her 19 years in the sport.    I almost don\u2019t see it as competing against others. I\u2019m competing against myself to solve the problem  Shauna Coxsey     \u201cI remember going to the climbing wall and it being rare to see other women. Now it is so popular. And what people use climbing for has changed, too. Once, it was a lifestyle that attracted only a certain group of people. Now people see climbing and bouldering as a way to keep fit and socialise. And what makes it unusual is that everyone goes to the same place to train, the same climbing walls, from beginners to elite climbers, all climbing routes beside each other.\u201d Coxsey\u2019s coach is Mark Glennie, who also coaches the British team. He came into climbing from athletics, and has seen British competition climbing transformed, both by the success of Coxsey and by the more organised approach to training. \u201cShauna\u2019s ability to recognise the patterns in the routes she needs to climb is second to none,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a sport it is a weird combination of things. It requires the ability to adapt quickly, like a combat sport, but you also have to move through a routine, like in gymnastics. It is both mental and physical.\u201d More widely, Glennie sees competition climbing emerging into the limelight as more indoor walls open and it becomes ever more accessible. \u201cThe sport is coming much more into people\u2019s consciousness. And it clearly works as a spectator sport. It is very gymnastic and exciting, but, unlike watching gymnastics where you sometimes don\u2019t know what is happening, it is easy to understand as a lay person.\u201d A decision on the proposed Olympic format is pending \u2013 it is likely to require climbers to compete in all three disciplines \u2013 but Glennie believes Coxsey\u2019s strength in bouldering would be an advantage. \u201cStrong bouldering skills would be a trump card,\u201d he said. With the next series of World Cup rounds beckoning, Coxsey knows she needs to stay fit. \u201cI felt last year I was nowhere near my limit. My body can handle so much more. I don\u2019t know how far I can go. It will be exciting to see.\u201d",
