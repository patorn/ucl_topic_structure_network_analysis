After weeks of clashes between police and protesters demanding the government withdraw a divisive labour bill, union leaders have called for transport strikes in 10 cities where the tournament is being held. The country\u2019s most powerful union, the CGT, which led the protests last week, has announced it will organise industrial action to hit the Paris metro as well as city bus services from 2 June, eight days before the month-long tournament opens. CGT officials have warned they will continue to disrupt France until the Socialist government scraps the law, which introduces more flexibility in working practices but is seen as business friendly and a threat to workers.   Related: Why have France's labour reforms proved so contentious?    As well as open-ended strikes it has also called for a national \u201cday of action\u201d \u2013 the ninth since the industrial action campaign began in March \u2013 on 14 June.  Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and his government, including the prime minister, Manuel Valls, have suggested they might be willing to tinker with the legislation, but have refused to abandon it. The Journal du Dimanche reported on Sunday that a source close to the president was expecting the government to compromise. \u201cThe CGT knows it will not succeed in getting the labour reform withdrawn, but it must be allowed to win in other areas,\u201d the paper said. Two other unions, Force Ouvri\u00e8re and SUD, have also issued strike calls. Force Ouvri\u00e8re\u2019s secretary general, Patrice Clos, told Reuters that his members would be called to strike in the host towns and cities, to put pressure on the government. \u201cAt our congress it was decided to do this because the law affects workers \u2026 we decided that we will call a strike all over sectors on each day of matches in the towns concerned,\u201d Clos said. SUD is threatening to call a strike with immediate effect until 11 July, when the tournament will be over. Two more unions, UNSA and CFDT, are calling for rolling strikes across the country from the end of this month. Virgile Caillet, general delegate of sports and leisure industries body Fifas, told BFMTV the strikes gave a \u201cvery negative image\u201d of France. Euro 2016 is expected to attract about 2.5 million extra visitors to France, including 500,000 football fans from Britain. It is hard to predict the effect of the strikes. Last Wednesday\u2019s call by the CGT for a transport strike, caused little disruption in Paris. However, with different unions threatening to strike at different moments, football fans could have difficulty travelling to matches in other French cities including Marseille and Bordeaux. Officials fear the disruption could hit Paris\u2019 bid to host the 2024 summer Olympics.",
