  "body": "Maybe it\u2019s the venue\u2019s gold shimmer curtain or perhaps it\u2019s the nervous energy of the five skinny boys in sportswear on stage. Whatever it is, there\u2019s a distinct atmosphere of adolescent school disco lingering over Liss\u2019s debut headline gig in London. The Danish four-piece are a curious contradiction. Their music, dubbed Scandi-soul, is often experimental and modern \u2013 the requisite qualities of any act signed to XL \u2013 but it also contains the schmaltz and sincerity of a 90s pop boyband. Tonight their intention is to establish themselves as pioneers of the strange and the smooth. Alien energies implode into sparkles and glitter, while electronic beats shatter blissful moments of serenity.  Playing a set composed largely of their debut EP, First, frontman S\u00f8ren Holm \u2013 a gangly figure fizzing with earnest intensity \u2013 has a voice that, at its most high pitched, sounds like a cross between a newborn baby and UB40\u2019s Ali Campbell.      Liss at Moth Club, London. Photograph: Venla Shalin/Getty Images    Playing a set composed largely of their debut EP, First, the group loosen their locked limbs after three songs, but they add very little between songs. Still, you sense that stage patter would only detract from the sense that we\u2019re witnessing heartbreak beamed in from a fumbling, teen-filled dancefloor: \u201cShe only thinks of me in the night-time,\u201d Holm sings on Miles Apart, skewering the archetypal booty-calling-bloke trope in pop. Sorry, meanwhile, is a skeletal slow dance, whereas the faraway wonder of Without Me sounds like Connan Mockasin honeymooning in Jamaica.  It all points to the fact that Liss are offering an odd, intriguing new take on the guitar band: skinheads and innocent smiles; their waistbands high, but the falsetto even higher.",
