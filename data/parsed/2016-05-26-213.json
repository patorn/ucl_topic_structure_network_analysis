  "body": "Alastair Cook has confirmed Chris Woakes will come into the England side for Friday\u2019s second Test with Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street as the replacement for the injured all-rounder Ben Stokes. With Stokes facing up to six weeks out following knee surgery on Tuesday, Cook and the head coach Trevor Bayliss have opted for Warwickshire\u2019s Woakes, fresh from taking nine for 36 against Durham this week, ahead of the Nottinghamshire seamer Jake Ball. While the move will see the wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and spinner Moeen Ali move up to No6 and No7 in the batting order respectively, Cook believes the balance of the side is less affected by the loss of his first-choice all-rounder given Woakes, in at No8, has nine first-class centuries to his name. The 27-year-old has returned only eight wickets from his six Tests to date, however he will go into his seventh brimming with form following Monday\u2019s superb exhibition of swing bowling against Durham, the day after he learned of his latest call-up. \u201cThis gives Chris another opportunity to play for England,\u201d said Cook. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the best of him yet in an England shirt, but he\u2019s in fine form for Warwickshire \u2013 a nine-for and a century in the last two weeks.   Related: New PCA ambassador Monty Panesar opens up on mental health issues    \u201cWe know Ben balances our side really well, but we need competition for the all-rounder place. It\u2019s disappointing for Ben. I\u2019ve just seen him upstairs \u2013 he\u2019s in a good mood after his operation went well. It\u2019s a bad thing for Ben missing out, but it gives someone else the opportunity.\u201d Asked about loss of Stokes, Cook added: \u201cHe\u2019s got that ability to win or change games of cricket very quickly and has done it a few times over the last few months. Certainly a lot of people want to come and watch him play, so he\u2019s going to be a big loss for us, but injuries are part and parcel of a side and we need to learn how to play without him.\u201d Moeen\u2019s promotion to No7 will be welcome by the player himself, with England\u2019s assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, admitting the left-hander has struggled to enjoy batting so low in the order given his top-order status at his county, Worcestershire. Cook added: \u201cI imagine it is hard for Mo, for a guy who\u2019s always batted up the order, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the best of Mo\u2019s batting. That\u2019s something we can maybe unlock a bit. He\u2019s a brilliant cricketer and I think he\u2019ll get better and better.\u201d England,  1-0 up, have the chance to complete the series win over Sri Lanka this week.",
