  "body": "Jonny Bairstow and his mum, Janet, offer a touching prelude to this interview. These days the usual \u201cmedia opportunity\u201d with a sportsman is policed by an agent or sponsor\u2019s representative determined to shape the encounter into a burble of cliches or a blatant plug for a product. This, instead, is a poignant exchange between a mother and her son only minutes after a thrilling win for Yorkshire takes them to the top of the County Championship. They know I\u2019m waiting to talk to the Yorkshire and England wicketkeeper, whose blistering form meant his 198 against Surrey followed a double century in the previous game, but I like the fact they stop to have a family exchange at Headingley. Janet and her son hug and chat and it makes sense that everything Jonny will say over the next hour is underpinned by their bond. Forty minutes later, as we enter the heart of this interview, Bairstow remembers how he tried to spot his mum and Becky, his sister, in a packed Cape Town crowd. Almost everyone in the ground had stood up to applaud Bairstow\u2019s first Test century, after 36 innings, against South Africa in early January.   Related: Angelo Mathews: \u2018Sri Lanka must be fearless against England in Test series\u2019    \u201cI had a vague idea where they were,\u201d Bairstow says. \u201cBut in that split second everything is a massive roar and pure emotion comes out. So trying to see my mum and sister was a challenge \u2013 even if Becky has bright red hair like me. We\u2019re like warning beacons but when everyone is standing, clapping, waving and cheering it\u2019s difficult.\u201d Bairstow had already lifted his head towards the heavens in Cape Town. His eyes were shut as he thought of his dad, whom he had lost at the age of eight, and his grandad, who died last year. We are about to move into painful territory but, before asking Bairstow about his father, David, who had also been a Yorkshire and England wicketkeeper, I wonder what other thoughts had whirled through him. \u201cDon\u2019t bloody get out!\u201d Bairstow says with a grin before he makes a telling point. \u201cLots of people doubted my abilities for a long time and so I thought: \u2018Right, you can stick that where the sun doesn\u2019t shine. That\u2019s for everyone who doubted me. I\u2019ve just scored a hundred against the No1 nation in the world in their own back yard.\u2019 There will be many challenges ahead but that one is embedded in my memory.\u201d Bairstow\u2019s next challenge begins at Headingley on Thursday, when England play Sri Lanka in the first of three Tests, but there is time for deeper reflection. \u201cThey played a massive role,\u201d Bairstow says of his father and grandfather as shadows stretch across a deserted ground lit by pale evening sunshine. \u201cDad played here for 20 years, and for England, and that\u2019s a huge legacy. If I come close to emulating that I\u2019ll be happy. Then there\u2019s grandpa. When Dad passed away, grandpa took on that mantle of teaching me how to tackle at football or taking me and mum to cricket.\u201d His father, beset by depression and financial worries, took his own life on a winter morning in January 1998. \u201cWe found Dad and, even aged eight, it was pretty obvious what happened,\u201d Bairstow says as he remembers how he and Becky returned home from school that day. The devastation of finding his dead father was a terrible, scarring experience. \u201cAbsolutely. We all found him. That wasn\u2019t easy to take because you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on when you\u2019re seven, like Becky, or eight. But we also knew mum had cancer at the same time because she\u2019d lost her hair. It was a pretty intense form of breast cancer and she was going through chemotherapy.\u201d Did he, as a small boy, understand his mother was so severely ill? \u201cNot really, no. But having gone through two bouts of breast cancer and all the operations and treatments it\u2019s fair to say mum\u2019s a special human being \u2013 especially as she had to deal with the tragedy and heartache that went with Dad\u2019s death. But the support we had, the amount of people who came to the funeral and memorial service was very touching. That definitely helped but it\u2019s testament to mum how Becky and I turned out.\u201d Suicide can shatter any family \u2013 but there was another cruel twist as it was Janet\u2019s birthday the day after David\u2019s death. \u201cMum sent us to school that day as if saying: \u2018Right, OK, we\u2019ve got to deal with it, carry on.\u2019 The only thing I can\u2019t really remember is walking into school that day. \u201cGoing through that adversity as a family has made us closer and stronger. Look at my sister \u2013 she\u2019s hard as nails as well. We\u2019re a special family and it\u2019s just that Dad\u2019s life was taken away from us far too early. Everywhere you go around the world he had an effect on people \u2013 in the Caribbean, Australia, South Africa or England. I\u2019ve never heard a bad word said about him.\u201d We discuss one of the most moving tributes to his dad \u2013 the writer David Hopps\u2019 choice of David Bairstow as his favourite cricketer. When reporting on Yorkshire, Hopps would be bollocked consistently by Bairstow Sr \u2013 \u201cYou know three-quarters of seven-eighths of sod all\u201d \u2013 who would then plonk down a pint in front of the young writer in the pub. \u201cThat shows the amount of respect people had for Dad. He was very well liked and someone who is very sadly missed \u2013 even now. People still come up and say: \u2018I had a pint with your dad in X, Y and Z pub and we laughed and joked.\u2019 Those are the amazing things you want to hear.\u201d Bairstow nearly lost his mum, again, when he was on tour in India with England in 2012. \u201cWe were warming up and I got a tap on my shoulder from the security guy. He said: \u2018Your mum\u2019s trying to get hold of you.\u2019 I thought \u2018Oh no \u2026\u2019 and sprinted to the dressing room. I couldn\u2019t get through to mum. I said: \u2018Tell me what\u2019s wrong, I can\u2019t get hold of her.\u2019 And then the words were uttered: \u2018Your mum\u2019s got cancer again.\u2019\u201d Bairstow\u2019s freckly face scrunches up. \u201cI was in the middle of Pune, a five-hour drive from Mumbai. I had another five-hour wait at Mumbai airport before flying back to Manchester. I then got stuck in traffic from Manchester to York and arrived at the hospital 20 minutes before mum went into theatre. But I had to come home to look after her.\u201d     Bairstow celebrates reaching his maiden Test century, against South Africa at Newlands in Cape Town in January. Photograph: Mike Hutchings/Reuters    His mother is well again and still working at Yorkshire Cricket Club \u2013 and it finally seems as if the adversity in Bairstow\u2019s life has been moulded by his pugnacious determination into lasting success. \u201cEven with Yorkshire I had 19 fifties before I got my first hundred,\u201d he points out. \u201cI\u2019ve scored 18 hundreds since then with three double centuries.\u201d Did he need to clear a psychological hurdle before racking up the centuries for Yorkshire? \u201cI didn\u2019t get out in the 90s. I was out for 82 about five times \u2013 which is ridiculous. I got 82 on my debut here against Somerset \u2013 and tried so hard to get over the line. It was the first time I\u2019d come across the media and everyone\u2019s doubting you. And then the first hundred I got was a double: 205 at Trent Bridge.\u201d Significantly, Bairstow\u2019s first Test century at Newlands ended up as an unbeaten 150. \u201cIt\u2019s how you go through those ups and downs. Look at Rooty [Joe Root \u2013 the world\u2019s No2-rated Test batsman and his Yorkshire team-mate with whom Bairstow shared a 372-run partnership last week]. He got dropped in Australia in 2014 and look how he reacted. Everyone has blips and bad patches. It\u2019s the way you react that counts.\u201d Bairstow has been in and out of England\u2019s team but, since replacing Jos Buttler as Test wicketkeeper this past winter, he seems settled. Has that show of confidence from the selectors made a real difference? \u201cYeah. Having that backing and not thinking: \u2018Is it me that gets dropped next?\u2019 is a help. It\u2019s obviously nice to turn up to training knowing you are preparing to play. I didn\u2019t change the way I played but I relaxed a little. I\u2019ve also worked hard on certain aspects of my keeping and been really pleased. Hopefully people can stop asking whether I want to keep wicket.\u201d   Related: England\u2019s batting under scrutiny in first Test against Sri Lanka | Vic Marks    Bairstow\u2019s Test role is established now and he relishes the chance to play Sri Lanka. \u201cThey turned us over in our own back yard in 2014. So it\u2019s going to be tough but with the brand of cricket we\u2019re playing \u2013 in Tests, ODIs or T20s \u2013 we feel we can become the best in the world. I\u2019m desperate to get back into the T20 and one-day sides and there\u2019s no reason why Jos and I can\u2019t play together. I feel I have a lot to offer in both and I\u2019ll keep trying my damndest.\u201d Bairstow has been hurt in many ways. He remembers how, as a footballer, \u201cI was at Leeds United from the ages of seven to 15 in the same team as Fabian Delph [now of Manchester City] and Danny Rose [now at Tottenham]. I wasn\u2019t quite good enough to play professional football, so I had a not very nice ending. It\u2019s a tough age to be cut. You deal with rejection at the same time as your GCSEs. But school was brilliant and everyone knows my amazing family \u2013 and the strength we have after everything. I was lucky those people were around me as I chose to go forward with cricket.\u201d Bairstow was reminded, again, of the fleeting nature of sport and life when James Taylor, his friend and England team-mate, retired suddenly last month after the diagnosis of a serious heart condition. \u201cI was absolutely distraught. I\u2019ve roomed with Titch and played rugby and cricket against him since we were 11. In rugby he was a 9 and I was a 10. You can imagine him at scrum-half \u2013 a tenacious little fella who absolutely loved playing.

Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Reuters    \u201cI was so shocked I felt a numbness knowing I\u2019d played with him for the last time after rooming together for so many years around the world. We had so many great times batting together and sharing an apartment in Australia. I did the cooking, he did the washing up. So all the memories and everything we could have shared, moving forward, got me. Knowing you\u2019re not going to have those times again with such a nice person is devastating.\u201d At least Taylor\u2019s condition was identified before he suffered a serious heart attack. \u201cExactly. I saw him last week and we went for dinner and just chilled. He has a fantastic family and everyone at Notts will help him.\u201d Bairstow will think of Taylor, and his father, when he plays for England at his beloved Headingley this week. \u201cIt\u2019s my 25th Test, so I\u2019ll get a new cap. That will mean a lot because we know it can end so suddenly. James was doing so well and it was taken away from him. Dad, exactly the same. It\u2019s been a journey, and a tough one at times, but you have to enjoy it and see where it takes you. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m back home for this next one. It will feel special.\u201d In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.
