Dave\u2019s like, chill, if I can fly easyJet you can take a Nissan Micra into Chippy, btw Craig says chuck a Pringles tube out of the window, shout-out to the C2s?    David Cameron eats Pringles and flies economy. Here's the proof http://t.co/3UD1Cz0O4T pic.twitter.com/7Xqbmc8Tgo\u2014 BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) August 18, 2015    I\u2019m like, & nobody will spot that just my actual BAG literally cost DOUBLE your hideous car?

Look, Dave is right, we easily can get new ones, God I just met Kim Kardashian, SO amusing, she pretended she did not know who I was! But you could totes see why Vogue says she is the new Dorothy Parker, eg Kim says nontouring is the new contouring #Algonquin #hilair.
