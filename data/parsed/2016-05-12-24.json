  "body": "An attempt by George Zimmerman to auction the gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin in 2012 appeared to be back on again Thursday following an extraordinary day in which the owner of the first website on which the weapon first appeared took down the listing, saying he wanted no part of the controversial sale. Billed as \u201cyour opportunity to own a piece of American history\u201d, Zimmerman\u2019s listing abruptly disappeared from GunBroker.com shortly after the auction\u2019s advertised 11am ET start time. The former neighbourhood watch volunteer, who was acquitted three years ago over the death of the unarmed black teenager in Sanford, Florida \u2013 a case that sparked protests and a national debate about race relations \u2013 was seeking at least $5,000 for the gun. But by mid-afternoon, the weapon, a Kel-Tec 9mm hand gun, was back up for sale on UnitedGunGroup.com, a rival firearms auction website. Its owner, Todd Underwood, told the Washington Post that as long as all laws were being followed, Zimmerman could list the gun on his site. \u201cI don\u2019t support it, I don\u2019t condone it, I don\u2019t have anything against it. It\u2019s his property, it\u2019s his decision,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cWhen you look at the facts of the case, he was charged and he was exonerated by a jury of his peers. This shouldn\u2019t even be a story. A gentleman who did nothing wrong is selling a personal possession of his to the highest bidder.\u201d On the original listing, Zimmerman described the gun as \u201cthe firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin.\u201d He said it had recently been returned to him by the Department of Justice and was fully functional. No explanation was given when the listing disappeared and was replaced by a message that said: \u201cSorry, but the item you have requested is no longer in the system.\u201d But in a statement posted on its website, GunBroker.com said that it took down Zimmerman\u2019s post because the company wanted \u201cno part\u201d in the listing nor the publicity it was receiving. The website added that Zimmerman did not contact anyone at the company prior to posting his listing. In a separate email to the Post, Zimmerman claimed the listing was removed because GunBroker.com \u201cwas not prepared for the traffic and publicity surrounding the auction of my firearm.\u201d The page had received almost a quarter of a million views before it vanished and attracted widespread criticism. In a tweet, the Washington DC-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence branded Zimmerman \u201cthe poster boy for a degenerate gun culture that treats murder weapons as idols to be displayed with pride\u201d. Zimmerman, however, fiercely defended his right to sell the gun, a Kel-Tec PF-9 9mm pistol. In an interview with WOFL, Orlando\u2019s Fox affiliate network, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a free American. I can do what I want with my possessions.\u201d He added it was \u201ctime to move past the firearm\u201d and that if it did not sell it would be put in a safe for his grandchildren. The website listing featured photographs of the gun taken at Zimmerman\u2019s 2013 murder trial and included a description that stated: \u201cMany have expressed interest in owning and displaying the firearm including the Smithsonian museum in Washington DC. This is a piece of American history. It has been featured in several publications and in current university textbooks. Offers to purchase the firearm have been received; however, the offers were to use the gun in a fashion I did not feel comfortable with.\u201d Tracy Martin, the murdered teenager\u2019s father, said on Thursday that he had \u201cno comment on the actions of that person that murdered Trayvon\u201d, continuing his habit of refusing to use Zimmerman\u2019s name. In a statement issued through civil rights attorneys Benjamin Crump and Daryl Parks, who have represented the family since the shooting, Martin said: \u201cThe Trayvon Martin Foundation is committed to ending gun violence in the United States. We are laser-focused on furthering that mission.\u201d Martin and Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon\u2019s mother, established the Miami-based foundation in the wake of their son\u2019s death to promote anti-gun legislation, offer support to other families who have lost a child through gun violence and provide mentoring for at-risk youths. The listing was timed to coincide with 12 months to the day Zimmerman was shot at in Florida, allegedly by Matthew Apperson, who was later charged with attempted murder. Zimmerman wrote that he was \u201cproud to announce\u201d that a portion of the proceeds raised would be used to \u201cfight BLM [Black Lives Matter] violence against Law Enforcement officers\u201d as well as ending the career of Angela Corey, his prosecutor \u2013 \u201cand Hillary Clinton\u2019s anti-firearm rhetoric\u201d. He signed off \u201cyour friend, George M Zimmerman\u201d and \u201cSi vis pacem, para bellum\u201d \u2013 the Latin adage, \u201cIf you want peace, prepare for war\u201d. Zimmerman was reportedly banned from Twitter in December but used the platform to voice similar views, including an apparent reference to Martin as a \u201cmoron\u201d, a description of the BLM movement as \u201cblack slime matters\u201d and a retweet of a post showing Martin\u2019s lifeless body with the caption, \u201cZ-man is a one-man army\u201d. The Florida man, a neighbourhood watch coordinator, shot and killed Martin, 17, in February 2012 after a violent altercation in a Sanford housing community. In a police call minutes before the killing, Zimmerman said he could see \u201ca real suspicious guy\u201d in the neighbourhood who \u201clooks like he is up to no good\u201d. Martin, who was unarmed, was returning from a convenience store. Zimmerman was not initially charged, until protests spread around the country demanding a full investigation. He successfully argued at his murder trial that he had acted in self-defence and was acquitted in July 2013. In February 2015 the federal justice department said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the 32-year-old for hate crimes. His ex-wife, Shellie, was placed on probation for a year and sentenced to community service in August 2013 after pleading guilty to a charge of perjury stemming from lies she told at a bond hearing for her husband pertaining to the couple\u2019s finances. The same month, Zimmerman was also back in the news for taking a controversial personal tour of the Kel-Tec gun factory in Cocoa, Florida, where the gun he used to kill Martin was made. He was photographed smiling with factory workers, earning a rebuke from his trial attorney Mark O\u2019Mara for the \u201cinappropriate\u201d visit. \u201cWe certainly would not have advised him to go to the factory that made the gun that he used to shoot Trayvon Martin through the heart,\u201d O\u2019Mara\u2019s spokesman, Shawn Vincent, said.",
