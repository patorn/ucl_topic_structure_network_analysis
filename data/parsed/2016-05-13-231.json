The former business secretary joined forces with Labour MP Chuka Umunna at a press conference in London, as they presented their arguments as to why small firms should vote for Britain to stay in the EU. Cable argued that most regulations small businesses find irksome emanate from UK governments and not the EU. He joked that he was behind quite a few of them, including shared parental leave and pension auto-enrolment. Umunna, former shadow business secretary, admitted the EU does need to cut red tape, but said: \u201cWe should remember that domestic governments of all different persuasions have always found the EU a very convenient dumping ground for blame when businesses complain about red tape.\u201d He said it was the way in which EU regulations were implemented in the UK which was the problem. Cable also pointed out there was no guarantee that the UK would be able to negotiate a favourable deal in the case of Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s a divorce. Divorces can be amicable, but very often they\u2019re not and people become irrational and angry, and you don\u2019t get what you want.\u201d He added that the uncertainty that would follow would be bad for the economy, and therefore bad for businesses: \u201cWhether or not people are in favour of Brexit, most people acknowledge, including quite a lot of the Brexit campaigners, that you are going to pass through a period \u2013 it could be two years, three years - of uncertainty. We don\u2019t know what the alternative arrangements will be.\u201d Umunna said access to the single market was one of the major reasons why small businesses should vote to stay in the EU, as it meant exporters to EU member states just had one single set of rules to comply with. He argued that exporters were not the only beneficiaries. \u201c28% of the produce on the shelves of our high-street stores comes from the EU \u2026 All of those goods would be subject to tariffs, which then smaller businesses would have to pass on to customers.\u201d When asked why more small businesses don\u2019t export to the EU, he pointed to research by the Federation of Small Businesses that found 50% of small business exporters weren\u2019t aware of the existence of UK Trade and Investment, the government organisation that helps companies expand overseas. \u201cThe other big factor is trade finance ,\u201d he said, with small firms not having the cash to start exporting. The single market also provides UK fast-growth companies with opportunities to scale up, making it easier for them to go on to break into emerging markets, Umunna argued.
