  "body": "My new boyfriend can\u2019t dress himself. Can I pick some festival outfits for him? Oh, darling. What matters is if your boyfriend has a great sense of humour and a little bit of that human touch. Trust me, in the end, it\u2019s all that matters. (Try adding Converses; I don\u2019t know why, but they seem to make everything else look like a fashion statement.) I\u2019m hoping to fall in love at a festival this year. What can I do to make it happen? Same, darling, same. I\u2019ve been roaming backstage like a poor teenage boy seeking the ideal prom date. Festivals are happy places, and you don\u2019t really want to enjoy them on your own. No luck for me so far, so I guess I can share with you what doesn\u2019t work: making heart shapes with your hands and silent stares. Seems like heart-shaped hands are not as cute as I thought, but rather absolutely creepy; as for silent stares, they\u2019re not effective enough to make your crush look back at you, unless you\u2019re Professor X. Knowing that, the main piece of advice I can give you is this: don\u2019t try too hard. As a famous French opera aria might say, l\u2019amour est enfant de boh\u00e8me (rough translation: you can\u2019t order love like a pizza). Just go and enjoy the music with some friends, and stay open and curious to everyone who crosses your path; great encounters sometimes happen like they\u2019re nothing at first.     A stuffed dog is pushed around the Glastonbury site. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images    Is it OK to take a dog to a festival? If so, can I take my pet parrot? Do not leave this parrot at home. It will be a fantastic plus for your festival outfit (huge and appropriate Jack Sparrow swag) and if it\u2019s gifted enough it can sing along to whomever is on stage. Just remember that your parrot will need constant watering, silent moments in between sets and pauses from the intensity of a packed crowd. Do you have any tips for saving money at a festival? The money is already lost on the ticket. Enjoy the burning sun, it\u2019s totally free! Sip hot beer from the crushed cups on the floor! I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t do drugs and I don\u2019t enjoy live music, but I\u2019ve decided to go to my first festival this year. How can I make sure I have fun? Be on stage! You definitely have what it takes to be a pop star. Form a band, go on tour \u2013 if you don\u2019t drink and don\u2019t do drugs, it will be much easier to endure weeks and weeks of travelling without it affecting your performances. If you don\u2019t enjoy live music, maybe it\u2019s because you secretly think you could do better? Try it out! I\u2019ve been doing it myself, and so far it has turned out to be really fun.     Yurts at Glastonbury. Photograph: Roger Cracknell/Alamy    Is it pretentious to book a yurt? Weird one. The process is indeed pretentious, but look how funny the word \u201cyurt\u201d is. Such a great word to text or to make puns with \u2013 and now you have an (expensive) excuse. \u201cCome to my yurt.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s meet at the yurt.\u201d \u201cI will always love yurt.\u201d Etc. I have always lived as a man, but I want to experiment \u2013 secretly \u2013 with presenting as a woman at Latitude. What should I do if I see someone I know? First of all, let\u2019s all welcome this new and fabulous version of you. You\u2019ll see that it\u2019s really a fun thing to experiment. And since you wanted to become her, you get to decide: what\u2019s her name? What are her memories? You can be new to the world, and so a wide smile and an introduction works with everyone as long as you\u2019re in charge; you can remember everything and everyone as well, as if the old you morphed into a new body. Up to you. I\u2019m sure your inner girl will be strong and carefree enough to do whatever she feels like if she bumps into someone. I bought a Glastonbury ticket, but it\u2019s the same weekend as my sister\u2019s wedding. I\u2019d much rather go to the festival \u2013 can I? This is where you get to choose, not between the festival or the wedding \u2013 obviously that choice is already made \u2013 but if and how you make it up her. Are you OK with being a hurtful music geek? Or will you write your sister a whole album out of guilt? Albums made out of guilt are often stellar \u2013 think post-divorce Marvin Gaye or Adele \u2013 so you could end up missing your sister\u2019s baby shower because you\u2019re playing at Glastonbury next year. But hey, this time you\u2019d have a solid excuse. My girlfriend and I have tickets to Secret Garden Party, but I\u2019m planning to break up with her. Would it be wrong to offer to buy her ticket? Give me your name and your picture so I can never fall in love with you. Christine and the Queens plays Latitude festival on 15 July",
