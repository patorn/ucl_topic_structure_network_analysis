Speaking at the summit of G7 world leaders in Japan, the prime minister was asked what margin of victory he felt would resolve an issue that had caused deep divisions within his party for decades. \u201cObviously a referendum is based on a simple majority,\u201d he said.   Related: A vote to remain in the EU won\u2019t be the last we hear of Brexit | John Redwood    Some Tory Brexiters have suggested the prime minister\u2019s authority would be fatally undermined if the government scrapes through the vote with a narrow majority for staying in the EU. But Cameron sought to isolate those who doubted the validity of his leadership in the wake of a narrow victory as a small group of life-long Eurosceptics. \u201cThere are some people whose life\u2019s work and core belief is that Britain must get out of Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cI have respect for people who hold a very strong view and do everything they can in politics to pursue that. \u201c[But] that is not my view; I disagree with them. There will always be some people who go on making that argument.\u201d John Redwood, the former Conservative minister and a longstanding critic of the EU, has argued in an article in the Guardian that the prime minister will face a tough task in reuniting his divided party if the public vote to remain. \u201cIt will be easier to unite the Conservative party if the UK chooses to leave the EU, as that will put the majority of members in agreement with a majority of the public and lead to the election of a pro-Brexit Conservative leader and prime minister when David Cameron steps down,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCameron faces a more difficult prospect if remain wins. Many of his MPs will be bitterly disappointed by the result and will want to hold the government to every promise made of an improved deal, and will wish to continue to expose the weaknesses and troubles of EU bureaucracy.\u201d      John Redwood: \u2018It will be easier to unite the Conservative party if the UK chooses to leave\u2019. Photograph: Richard Gardner/RexShutterstock    He added: \u201cWhichever way the public votes the next leader of the Conservative party is likely to be a Brexiteer.\u201d Cameron made clear that with less than a month to go before polling day, his biggest fear is that turnout will be low among young voters, who tend to be more pro-EU. \u201cOne of the things on the campaigning front that is my greatest concern is doing everything we can in the next week in order to get people to register to vote, particularly young people,\u201d he said.   Guardian Explained: EU and young people   \u201cBecause this is absolutely a vote about their future, this vote will determine the sort of country, the sort of economy they grow up in, the sort of opportunities they have.\u201d The remain campaign, which is being closely coordinated by Downing Street, will switch its focus to the benefits of EU immigration on Thursday, pointing out that as many as 250,000 EU citizens work in Britain\u2019s public services, and urging leave campaigners to say what would happen to them in the event of Brexit. Former Labour home secretary Jacqui Smith said advocates of Brexit, including Boris Johnson \u2013 whom she described as \u201cNigel Farage in a blonde wig\u201d\u2013 had questions to answer about how they would tackle immigration outside the EU. \u201cOur country is being asked to vote for an economic shock, higher prices, lower wages, a permanently poorer country, weaker security cooperation and a less influential Britain on the world stage \u2013 all in return for some unspecified new immigration policy that the leave campaign have not even bothered to think through,\u201d she said. Cameron\u2019s enthusiasm for winning over the under-25s is at odds with the Conservatives\u2019 general election strategy, which was centred on wooing older voters. It has also drawn criticism from Labour, who claim a Tory decision to speed up new rules for voter registration led to up to a million young people falling off the register. Gloria De Piero, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for young people and voter registration, agreed that it was vital for young people to take part and welcomed Cameron\u2019s call for action. \u201cHowever, it comes after many months of the government ignoring our warnings that young people are the least likely age group to be on the electoral register,\u201d she said. Cameron said the issue of Brexit was likely to \u201cbe on the agenda\u201d at the G7 meeting. \u201cBut the G7 and G20 have already made clear that it is a threat to economic growth, a risk to the world economy,\u201d he added. News that the Conservatives have received more in donations this year than all of the other political parties put together helped fuel fears within Labour that Cameron is preparing for the risk of a snap general election if his party is severely destabilised by the June vote.New figures from the Electoral Commission showed that more than \u00a36.7m out of the almost \u00a312m reported to the watchdog was given to the Conservatives in the first quarter of this year. Labour took \u00a33.7m while the Liberal Democrats received \u00a3592,000 and Ukip raised \u00a3187,080.Much of the money will have been raised to help fight the local, assembly and mayoral elections, but the total is much higher than in comparable quarters in previous years, which were averaging about \u00a33m in donations. The fixed-term parliament act, passed to provide stability for the coalition between the Lib Dems and Tories, means the government has been elected for five years. There would need to be a two-thirds majority in parliament to overturn it, but it would be difficult for Labour to turn down the opportunity to attempt to get rid of a Conservative government.",
