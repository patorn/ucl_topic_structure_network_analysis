  "body": "Concerns that ministers will have too much power over the BBC, because they will be able to appoint six members of its executive board, were raised by the corporation\u2019s director general after the publication of the white paper on its future.  Tony Hall called the change in the BBC\u2019s governance the \u201cmost significant reform in the BBC\u2019s history\u201d and said the broadcaster was still in dispute with the government over the implementation of plans.  \u201cWe have an honest disagreement with the government on this,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI do not believe the appointments proposal for the new unitary board are yet right. We will continue to make the case to government. It is vital for the future of the BBC that its independence is fully preserved.\u201d   Related: BBC white paper: key points at a glance    The new board will have between 12 and 14 members, with the chair, deputy chair and four others \u2013 representing the nations and regions \u2013 being appointed by the government.  Rona Fairhead, chair of existing governing body, the BBC Trust \u2013 which will be scrapped at the end of the year, will take up the chair of the unitary board as a transitional appointment until her contract expires in October 2018. Culture secretary John Whittingdale had originally wanted ministers to have the power to appoint the majority of board members but was ultimately blocked by Downing Street.  Presenting the white paper to the Commons, Whittingdale said: \u201cFor the first time, the BBC will have the ability to appoint a majority of its board independently of government. Editorial decisions will remain the responsibility of the director general, and his editorial independence will be explicitly enshrined in the charter, while the unitary board will consider any issues or complaints that arise post-transmission.\u201d     Culture secretary John Whittingdale published his white paper for the BBC on Thursday. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters    Maria Eagle, the shadow culture secretary, attacked the idea that the make-up of the new board provided the BBC with a guarantee of independence. \u201cAt least half [the board] will be government appointees,\u201d she said. This board will have influence over the output and therefore over editorial decisions. There has developed a feeling both inside and outside this parliament that the government is seeking inappropriate influence over the BBC.\u201d   Related: It lacks the glamour of saving Strictly \u2013 but the BBC\u2019s new board must be resisted | Polly Toynbee    Eagle\u2019s scepticism of the government\u2019s potential to unduly influence the board, and by extension the BBC, was a theme taken up by many. Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky \u2013 who warned of the threat to the BBC at the Bafta TV awards on Sunday night \u2013 said so many government appointees on the board would \u201ckiss goodbye\u201d to the BBC\u2019s reputation for independence and see it \u201cdrift dangerously close to becoming a state broadcaster\u201d. Aside from the concerns about governance, Hall said was broadly happy with the white paper, particularly after speculation that had surfaced in the media over recent weeks that the scale and scope of corporation would be cut, by for example preventing it scheduling popular programmes directly against ITV and other commercial rivals. The BBC will be required to publish the pay of its top-tier stars who earn more than the \u00a3450,000 a year earned by Hall, such as Gary Lineker, Chris Evans and Graham Norton. Whittingdale had wanted it to be those on \u00a3150,000 and above but this was over-ruled by David Cameron. Other key elements include securing an 11-year charter that frees the BBC from the political electoral cycle, although there is a \u201cmid-term\u201d governmental review clause.     Maria Eagle, the shadow culture secretary, was highly critical of the new board. Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian    The BBC\u2019s future funding has been secured with the licence fee set to increase in line with inflation for five years from 2017 from its existing \u00a3145.50, and guaranteed as the funding mechanism until end of the new royal charter in 2027/28. There will also be a clause on diversity \u201censhrined\u201d in the new royal charter, a move welcomed by TV and stage star Lenny Henry who has vigorously campaigned for increased diversity on-screen and off-screen. Greg Dyke, the former BBC director general, suggested that Whittingdale had been \u201cput back in his box\u201d by the government, which quashed some of his more draconian plans. \u201cJohn Whittingdale made his position clear over many years \u2013 he would like radical change to the BBC,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s now the secretary of state but he hasn\u2019t got the radical change, which tells me that David Cameron and [chancellor] George Osborne ... have actually put him back in his box.\u201d Whittingdale told MPs that those who raised concerns about his plans for the BBC were \u201cleftwing luvvies\u201d who had based their complaints on \u201cill-founded, hysterical speculation\u201d. Overall, the BBC said that the white paper will \u201cprovide the BBC with long-term stability\u201d and remain a \u201cbeacon of quality and a standard-bearer of British values admired the world over\u201d. However, former culture secretary Tessa Jowell warned against the view that the government\u2019s plan for the future of the BBC is not as benign as it may like to believe. \u201cI think the white paper risks being a Trojan horse for all the things the government wanted to do that came up in those whack-a-mole stories [before the publication of the white paper],\u201d said Jowell. \u201cThey are all incubating in this white paper as a long term risk to the future of the BBC.\u201d",
