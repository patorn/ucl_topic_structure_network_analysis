  "body": "The jokes were sharp and cynical the first time around. And in the sequel to the parents-versus-students comedy, they still generate plenty of laughs. The problem is, they are the same jokes, recycled into a nearly identical premise. This time Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) find themselves living next to a sorority, and a reasonable request to keep the partying at a low level results in an escalation to all-out war. Teddy (Zac Efron) returns, this time on the side of the \u201cold people\u201d, and his low- achieving haplessness and tendency to strip off result in some of the film\u2019s most amusing moments.           Seth Rogen: \u2018There are probably jokes in Superbad bordering on the blatantly homophobic\u2019 \u2013 video interview",
