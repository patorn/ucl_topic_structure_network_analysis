  "body": "If it was a boxing match then the crowd might be asking for their money back. BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show took the first three rounds of his Sunday morning political face-offs with Robert Peston on ITV, and by the time you read this, in all probability the fourth. Unlike the looming EU referendum, there was nothing close about it, Peston watched by 230,000 viewers last Sunday against Marr\u2019s 1.2 million. At least it\u2019s getting narrower \u2013 first time out Peston had 166,000 viewers against Marr\u2019s 1.6 million. As both channels never tire of pointing out, it\u2019s not a head to head, because Marr\u2019s 9am show is over by the time Peston starts at 10am. More nose to tail then, but ITV is behind whichever way you look at it. Peston\u2019s show is also beaten by Nicky Campbell\u2019s Big Questions which follows Marr on BBC1. It was always going to be an uphill task for the BBC\u2019s former economics editor who was given his own show when he signed a reported \u00a3350,000 deal to become ITV\u2019s new political editor last year, memorably saying he wanted to \u201chumiliate\u201d the BBC (and later regretting it). Viewers are not used to watching politics on ITV on Sunday \u2013 it is 10 years since Jonathan Dimbleby\u2019s show was axed and its replacement, The Sunday Edition, proved short-lived \u2013 and nearly 30 years since its Sunday lunchtime programme Weekend World. More recently its Sunday morning schedule has been filled with Jeremy Kyle repeats and reruns of The X Factor. So Peston wasn\u2019t just coming from a standing start; he was having to court viewers who had previously tuned in to watch Angela Lansbury in Murder, She Wrote. Vicky Flind, series editor of Peston on Sunday, says: \u201cWe are realistic. I am not getting overly anxious too early on about the ratings. I am very aware that 10am on Sunday morning on ITV has not been a political space for a very long time.\u201d Flind, former editor of BBC1\u2019s This Week with Andrew Neil, says: \u201cWhat I focus on is trying to create a really good and entertaining politics show that is distinctive in quite a crowded market. We want it to feel fresh and a little bit different, and to build it around Robert\u2019s character and personality. Nothing has been said or done since we have been on air to doubt that we are there for the long term. If we are given the time to do it we will have a good shot.\u201d The rival shows\u2019 impact can also be measured not only in viewing figures but how many quotes are generated online and in the following day\u2019s newspapers. Flind, whose guests so far have included David Cameron, George Osborne and Jeremy Corbyn, says: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be noticed and we have been noticed.\u201d Former ITN chief executive Stewart Purvis says the Peston show is \u201call about the ITV brand. They are probably never going to win the ratings battle \u2013 they might not even accept they are in one \u2013 but what it does do is enhance the ITV brand in terms of the channel\u2019s appeal to upmarket viewers. It is something they can be proud of.\u201d All the more important, he adds, after the \u201cNews at When?\u201d saga and the axing of the Dimbleby show and World in Action. \u201cThe only shows MPs watch are news and current affairs programmes, so if you want to connect with policy makers you have to connect with them in terms of something they actually watch.\u201d ITV has used high-profile signings such as Peston and its latest, new economics editor Noreena Hertz, to take the fight to the BBC, which it will never be able to match in terms of funding. Former political editor Tom Bradby\u2019s switch to News at Ten was another example (although BBC1\u2019s 10pm news bulletin remains pre-eminent). The Andrew Marr Show averages 1.5 million in the year to date, up from 2014 (1.3m) but marginally down on 2012, when it had 1.6 million. There is a similar pattern for Andrew Neil\u2019s Sunday Politics, which averages 814,000 in the year so far, up on 2014 (664,000) but down on four years ago (884,000). Marr show editor, Rob Burley, says: \u201cI used to work on ITV\u2019s political programmes and I am genuinely glad ITV have decided to return to something they should be doing. It\u2019s good to have someone else in the marketplace who might book the guests you want, and it makes you work extra hard. I don\u2019t think we are competing, we are on at different times. We are a long-established show which is evolving.\u201d Both Purvis (\u201cI think it\u2019s really good. He is very conversational in his interviews, it really works\u201d) and former BBC executive Roger Mosey are fans of the Peston show. \u201cBoth Marr and Peston are very good shows,\u201d says Mosey. \u201cMarr is an indispensable part of Sunday morning, like Today on weekdays. Peston has made a confident, watchable start. He\u2019s settling in and Allegra [Stratton, signed from BBC2\u2019s Newsnight] is a good booking.\u201d Mosey would like to see Peston tackle the \u201cbig strategic choices that politicians have to make\u201d rather than be tempted by the \u201crelentless bombardment of the short term. Not quite Weekend World \u2013 it should definitely be modernised \u2013 but using Peston\u2019s brain and intelligence, as we see all the time in his blogs, to get something that\u2019s at a different level to everyday cut and thrust\u201d. But Sky News presenter Adam Boulton thinks the Sunday morning rivalry \u201ca really rather tired debate. I did a Sunday morning programme for 17 years. Basically what they do is manufacture Sunday for Monday quotes for the written press. \u201cI\u2019m not criticising Robert or comparing him unfavourably to Andrew, and I have great admiration for Vicky [Flind] \u2026 but I think this is a vanity exercise by ITV. \u201cThey are trying to get back to the glory days of News at Ten when it was regarded as prestige news. Hats off for trying, but ITV deserted that land for a long time.\u201d",
