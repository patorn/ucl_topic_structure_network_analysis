  "body": "Robert Peston nearly doubled his audience for the second outing of his new Sunday morning show on ITV but he was aided by a little divine intervention on BBC1.   Related: Robert Peston\u2019s ITV show pulls in a tenth of Andrew Marr's BBC audience    Peston on Sunday was watched by 302,000 viewers, a 4.8% share, from 10am on Sunday, up from the 166,000 who tuned in for the debut outing of his show last week. But the ITV News political editor was given a slightly easier task after BBC1 dropped its Nicky Campbell talk show The Big Questions in favour of live coverage of the Pentecost from Liverpool cathedral. BBC1 still won the slot, but Pentecost Sunday Live could only manage 356,000 viewers (5.7%), half the more than 700,000 viewers who watched last week\u2019s The Big Questions. Normal battle will be resumed next week. Peston still had a fraction of the audience for BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, which an hour earlier was watched by 1.3 million viewers (21.9%) from 9am. Queen\u2019s 90th is majestic hit for ITV while BBC1\u2019s Undercover bows out ITV\u2019s celebration of the Queen\u2019s 90th birthday was a majestic sized hit for the channel with 6.1 million viewers, a 30.9% share, from 9pm. It was the most watched programme of the day across all channels, beating those traditional ratings winners, Countryfile, with just under 5 million viewers (28.1%) from 7pm, and Antiques Roadshow, with 4.9 million viewers (23.6%) from 8pm. The Queen\u2019s 90th Birthday Celebration also beat the final part of BBC1\u2019s six-part Adrian Lester and Sophie Okonedo drama Undercover, which ended with 3.7 million viewers, a 16.6% share, having opened with 5.2 million viewers five weeks ago. ITV\u2019s royal celebration followed Let\u2019s Do It, an hour-long tribute to Victoria Wood, which was watched by 4.6 million viewers, a 24% share, from 8pm.",
