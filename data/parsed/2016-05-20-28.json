What\u2019s become known as the Hudson River Derby is a nascent rivalry fueled by vitriol and modest violence. It\u2019s an enmity that\u2019s seen supporters from both clubs hurl fists and insults as a means of proving which team best represents the five boroughs.   Related: MLS's top 20 earners make nearly half of league's wages, salary report shows    The derby creates the drama typical of soccer rivalries the world over, which seems to radiate from the pitch and into the hearts of fans at the first whistle. While tension might end with supporters verbally sparring at a subway stop \u2013 or in a scuffle outside a New Jersey bar \u2013 one glaring caveat is the derby\u2019s absence of history. After all, City have only just embarked upon their second season, after a disappointing inaugural campaign left the club short of the playoffs. So far, the Red Bulls have coasted to victory in all three derbies, but their fans still feel overshadowed by the presence of a new team that have encroached upon their territory. For Red Bulls fans, many of whom followed the team as the New York/New Jersey Metro Stars in the 1990s, the club owed its roots to the very first awakening of American soccer fervor. At a time when the modest MLS was overshadowed by towering American sports figures like Michael Jordan, Derek Jeter and Emmitt Smith, the Empire Supporters Club gathered at Giants Stadium to support a team that existed in obscurity. The ESC was established in 1995 by young socialists and political radicals, many of whom fought to keep a developing tide of far right-wing extremism out of American soccer leagues. The ESC not only claims to be the oldest MLS supporters group, but the rightful heirs of New York City\u2019s developing soccer kingdom. Steve Ferrezza, a board member of the ESC, recalls the early days, when seats at Giants Stadium were largely empty but hearts were full, as the seeds of early fandom were planted. \u201cI remember the days at Giants Stadium when there were only 2,000 people in the stadium. I would have to take the subway to Jersey Transit to a shuttle bus, and then run across the parking lot to get to the tailgate in time to pick up my ticket,\u201d he says. While things have changed, and notably for the better \u2013 the Red Bulls no longer play at the since-demolished Giants Stadium, but at their own arena in Harrison, New Jersey \u2013 Ferrezza likens the emergence of City to a privileged neighbor stealing whatever limelight the Red Bulls battled for decades to attain. \u201cNo pun intended, but [City supporters] were basically born on third base. They didn\u2019t have to fight for anything,\u201d says Ferrezza. His words are supported by City\u2019s generous financial backing. The team is owned 80% by City Football Group, a holding company of Abu Dhabi United Group, which directs the operations of the Premier League\u2019s Manchester City in addition to other clubs in Japan and Australia. The club\u2019s other owner \u2013 with a 20% stake \u2013 are the Yankees. Because of this, many Red Bulls fans, like Daniel Fridman, a lifelong New Yorker who\u2019s been watching his team play since he was nine years old, see City as nothing more than an expansion team. He believes NYC FC skirted the league\u2019s official regulations by setting up shop so quickly, and notes that the crosstown rivals feel more \u201clike a newborn that was ripped out of a stomach\u201d than an official franchise. \u201cAll these people who could have supported Metros, they chose City because they play in the Bronx? It just irritates me,\u201d he says.     David Villa: NYC FC superstar.

NYC FC are the first MLS team to play within the New York City limits. The Red Bulls maintain a New York affiliation but play across the river in Harrison, about 40 minutes from Manhattan. For NYC FC fans, the New York moniker carried by the Red Bulls is a farce steeped in two decades of false advertising. \u201cNew York City residents and people around the five boroughs have a lot pride in this area,\u201d says Ben Glidden, marketing director for The Third Rail, City\u2019s 1,000-member strong supporters group. \u201cWhen [NYC FC] came along, I think it reignited a passion people had for not only the sport of soccer but supporting something greater, that represented the city,\u201d he says. For Glidden, an innate \u201csense of pride\u201d might not necessarily flourish when the only area soccer team plays in a different state. He says City fans are attracted to the club\u2019s crest, which invokes famous New York sporting iconography, reminiscent of the Yankees. Glidden also notes that the clamor that followed City\u2019s emergence as the 20th MLS franchise shows that the Red Bulls hadn\u2019t satisfied whatever \u201cthirst fans had for a team,\u201d in New York City. And he may be right, given how passionate City fans can be and the lengths they\u2019ll go to express support: before the inaugural derby last year, a parade of fans organized by The Third Rail marched from midtown Manhattan to Red Bulls Arena in New Jersey, carrying flags, banging drums and singing songs. The stunt got a few unlucky participants in trouble, and many supporters were asked by authorities to leave the New Jersey Transit train carrying them to the game. City\u2019s draw also lends itself to the marquee signings of David Villa, Andrea Pirlo and Frank Lampard \u2013 three European players whose reputations made for attractive billboards, but have yet to translate to on-field dominance for the club. The former Arsenal great Patrick Vieira also started coaching City this season, creating a great deal of cache for a team primed to take over the MLS\u2019s biggest market. As the rivalry\u2019s book is still largely being written, there\u2019s little doubt that the Hudson River Derby is doing great things for soccer in North America. Glidden says that the Third Rail has \u201cfolks calling us from all kinds of newspapers. Blogs in the UK are starting to pay attention to this match, and as the level of soccer gets better \u2013 as it will and has \u2013 the level of the rivalry will improve.\u201d That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all New Yorkers are swept up in the derby\u2019s hysterics: just on Wednesday, sportscaster Mike Francesca failed to even understand that the Red Bulls and City are two separate teams during a routine promotional ad for Saturday\u2019s game at Yankee Stadium. As for how the game itself will unfold, the tide may be turning in City\u2019s favor. The team are currently first in the Eastern Conference while the Red Bulls are back in fifth place.",
