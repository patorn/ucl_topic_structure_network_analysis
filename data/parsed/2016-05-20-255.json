  "body": "Rivalry week is here \u2013 and NYC FC host the Red Bulls It\u2019s here. New York City FC have the glitz and glamor, the big-name coach, the telegenic European superstars, and the world famous stadium \u2013 albeit one that belongs to a baseball team. New York Red Bulls have the tradition and the history, an atmospheric soccer-specific arena, and possession of the Supporters\u2019 Shield. \u201cTwenty years late and a stadium short,\u201d the Red Bulls fans zinged their rivals \u2013 but then NYC FC fans can retort: well, at least we\u2019re not named after an Austrian energy drink. New York media have been making a big deal of this game, with a slew of ads on TV and many billboards plastered around the city. Let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s no dud.   Related: Patrick Vieira, New York City FC and the Third Rail    NYC FC have never won the so-called Hudson River Derby since its first inception \u00a0last year \u2013 but they go into this one as favorites. A point against Toronto on Wednesday kept up their good recent run, and they sit atop the Eastern Conference \u00a0on 17 points. Kwadwo Poku\u2019s delicious curler gave Patrick Vieira\u2019s side the lead at BMO Field, and though Toronto dominated afterwards, all they had to show for it was a Will Johnson equaliser. It was a good point for NYC FC, who rested several key players. David Villa, Andrea Pirlo and Tommy McNamara were given the night off from starting, and NYC FC missed them, but their often criticised defence shut down TFC\u2019s Sebastian Giovinco, and the team escaped with a draw. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play our best game,\u201d admitted Vieira. \u201cWhen you make so many changes, I knew it would be quite difficult against one of the best sides in the league.\u201d Mix Diskerud left the field, echoed Vieira\u2019s comments, and rubbed his hands \u2013 metaphorically \u2013 for the visit of the Red Bulls. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with that one point and now we\u2019re going to focus on the next game. It\u2019s going to be a huge game and hopefully we can fill up the stadium \u2013 and win it.\u201d Thirty thousand tickets have already been sold, but the team are going to open the upper tier of Yankee Stadium to accommodate even more. Single-game tickets for the 400-level seats start at about $40; fans in New York with a free Saturday afternoon could do worse than take a trip to the Bronx. Red Bulls squeeze out a win against rock-bottom Chicago While NYC FC have been on an upward trajectory, the Red Bulls have been up and down. Their 1-0 win over Chicago on Wednesday was most welcome, especially as it followed Friday night\u2019s disappointing 2-0 defeat at DC United. Mike Grella got the game-winner in the 58th minute, after good work from Bradley Wright-Phillips and Lloyd Sam, and efficiency was the key word for the Red Bulls: it proved to be their only shot on target in the whole game. Fortunately for them, Chicago are the most compliant team in the league away from their home stadium: that\u2019s now 30 games on the road in which they\u2019ve failed to register a victory. Jesse Marsch overplayed Chicago\u2019s threat on the counter-attack in his post-game comments, but was pleased to see one out. \u201cThe fact that we got a shutout against some very dangerous attacking players on the counter I think was a big step for us, and to grind out a game 1-0, right?\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done that all year. We haven\u2019t shown the ability in a tight game to come out as the victor.\u201d The Red Bulls have picked themselves up after a terrible start, but it\u2019s hard to say they\u2019ve turned the corner. They\u2019ve already lost seven times this year, which leaves little room for error in their quest to make the playoffs. The good thing for them is that the East, more so than the West, is congested: a streak of wins and they\u2019re right back in the mix. Saturday would be a good place to start a little run. \u201cWe know that we\u2019ve got a huge task on Saturday,\u201d keeper Joel Robles said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about where we sit in the standings or what our run of form is right now. It\u2019s gonna be about a pretty awesome rivalry that\u2019s starting to gain momentum. And I know that [NYC FC are] going to be looking to rectify what happened last year.\u201d More problems for Chicago, though. Veljko Paunovic\u2019s team have shown promise, but nobody has scored fewer than their paltry eight goals, and a gap is beginning to open up at the foot of the table. Kennedy Igboananike has impressed with four goals already, but the loss of David Accam has been keenly felt. (He\u2019s now back from a knee injury, and that should make Chicago feel better.) \u201cIt\u2019s a part of the process where we are,\u201d Paunovic said. \u201cWe are a young team, a team under construction still. But growing and we learn from the lessons and we just keep on pushing hard.\u201d Revs happy to have Kei Kamara as they take on Dallas New England\u2019s Kei Kamara era started last week against Chicago, and things looked immediately better. Kamara didn\u2019t get the debut goal fans wanted, but he provided the focus around which Lee Nguyen, Diego Fagundez and Juan Agudelo were able to prompt and rove, and Chicago offered little by way of response. The Revolution muskets fired twice, Jay Heaps\u2019 team recorded only their second league win of the season, and afterwards, the smiles were as wide as the Charles river. With six points from the past two games, Dallas\u2019s mini-wobble appears to be over, but like the teenage petrolhead who keeps getting stopped for speeding, they have issues on the road. Dallas haven\u2019t lost in Frisco this season, but they\u2019ve been really poor away from home, and have acquired the knack of getting thumped: one wonders if their apparent brittleness is tactical or mental. \u201cI think we just carry our momentum from this week,\u201d defender Walker Zimmerman said this week. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a game at home, but we\u2019re confident in who we are and confident that we can win wherever we play. We\u2019ve had some road struggles, but I don\u2019t think that is in any way the identity of this team, and I think we\u2019re hoping to bounce back for a road win.\u201d Oscar Pareja rotated his squad against Seattle last time out, but Tesho Akindele, Fabian Castillo and Mauro Diaz, all substituted in the second half, should be back in time for Foxborough. Matt Hedges is still out with a shoulder injury, and Maxi Urruti is doubtful, but Dallas have enough quality to come away with victory \u2013 providing they can keep Kamara quiet. Philadelphia and DC United renew their non-rivalry One of the irritating things about MLS\u2019s rivalry week \u2013 sponsored by Heineken! \u2013 is the league\u2019s insistence on promoting conflicts that don\u2019t really exist. DC and Philly might be separated by little more than a couple of hours in the car, but any MLS fan will tell you that DC\u2019s real rivals are the Red Bulls. Trying to promote fixtures in such obviously manufactured style annoys the real supporters, and gives American sports leagues a bad name. (The NHL is guilty of this, too.) United head coach Ben Olsen more or less acknowledged that the rivalry didn\u2019t exist on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the fans, and how the perceive other teams. I don\u2019t get caught up in that stuff too much,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cBut they are pretty close to us. Someone called it a friendly rivalry, and I think that was a good description of it.\u201d Bill Hamid, DC\u2019s goalkeeper, got it right when he said: \u201cI think the DC-Red Bulls game is the ultimate Major League Soccer rivalry \u2013 clearly, they are trying to push away from it and make a New York derby. But there have always been physical matches against Philadelphia. We don\u2019t really like each other, but we always bring it when we play against each other.\u201d Well, quite. In competitive sports, which teams actually do like other? Derby or not, Philadelphia and DC offers up an intriguing match-up between two of this season\u2019s unfancied sides. Philly have just gone off the boil with a couple of draws, albeit against good opposition in LA and Montreal, while DC have picked it up after a poor start, and their 2-0 victory over the Red Bulls last week was impressive. But DC can\u2019t seem to put together a run: every positive result \u2013 the 4-0 walloping of Vancouver, for example, or the 3-0 win over New England \u2013 has been followed by a stutter. Can they make it two for two? Some good news for DC: Hamid has returned from his knee injury, and could be included in the squad, although Travis Worra will continue in goal for Friday\u2019s match. Chris Rolfe is still missing with concussion, but Alvaro Saborio enjoyed a bit of personal news this week: he was picked in Costa Rica\u2019s 23-man squad for this summer\u2019s Copa Centenario. He\u2019ll join up with Los Ticos after Friday\u2019s game, and will be looking to sign off with a bang. Portland and Vancouver do it in the Pacific Northwest Rounding out the rivalry week is Vancouver v Portland. Vancouver are two for two in the Cascadia Cup this season, and beat Portland 2-1 just the other week. The Whitecaps seem, thankfully, to have found their form, and some punch, finally, in attack: 10 goals in their last four games shows a huge turnaround from earlier this season, when they couldn\u2019t buy a goal, and went four straight without scoring. The veteran Blas Perez nabbed two against Chicago, and Kekuta Manneh was named MLS player of the week for his performance in that wild 4-3 against Toronto last week: two goals and two assists represented his best day for Vancouver since his hat-trick against Seattle in 2013. \u201cI just said to him: \u2018Go and enjoy yourself\u2019 \u2013 and he did,\u201d said Caps coach Carl Robinson, who started Manneh centrally against TFC, with Pedro Morales, another goalscorer, on the left. \u201cWhen he enjoys himself and plays like he does, he\u2019s able to unlock defences. And I think people still forget he\u2019s only 21 years of age, so he\u2019s still got a long way to go. He\u2019s a huge talent.\u201d The Timbers, meanwhile, just can\u2019t get it going. They\u2019ve lost three in a row for the first time since Caleb Porter became head coach, and have dug themselves into a hole in the Western Conference. Colorado and Dallas have made the early running; the champions are playing catch-up. They\u2019ll be hoping Fanendo Adi is passed fit to play on Sunday. The Nigerian has eight goals already this season, but hobbled off with a hamstring injury against New York City last week to give Timbers fans the heebie-jeebies. A scan indicated it wasn\u2019t too serious, but Portland haven\u2019t confirmed whether Adi will be OK to play. If he doesn\u2019t make it, much will rest on the shoulders of Diego Valeri, especially with Darren Mattocks still out and Dairon Asprilla persona non grata. (Asprilla\u2019s recent absence from the matchday squad has fuelled speculation he might be on his way out.) Porter knows it\u2019s a marathon, however, and he\u2019s not one to panic. \u201cThe season is not done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long season. We have 22 games and we\u2019re going to need to win a good chunk of those games, not all of them, a little over half of them, historically speaking when you look at points. That means we still can lose some games, but we got to start winning and we know that.\u201d",
