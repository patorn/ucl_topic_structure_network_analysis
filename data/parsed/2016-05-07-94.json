  "body": "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has struck out at Democrat senator Elizabeth Warren as he begins to turn his attention away from the primaries and towards the general election in November.   Related: Reality check: Does the electoral map work in Trump's favor?    Thousands of Trump supporters turned out in Eugene, Oregon, to witness their candidate in his week of triumph over the Republican party; the queue, sweating in the hot bright sunlight, snaked out away from the convention centre and spilled from the compound into the street. By the time of the event\u2019s scheduled start at 7pm, the hall was near-full with five thousand people, according to one staffer, still outside. There were so many people that it overwhelmed the cell networks, crashing internet connections in the hall. \u201cOur country is going to hell,\u201d Trump told the crowd, grinning a little, and adapting his usual refrain slightly. \u201cBut the good news is, we\u2019re going to make it greater, greater, greater, greater, greater than ever before.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech hinted at the direction his campaign may now take as he refocuses on November after seeing off all 18 of his Republican opponents. In Oregon, Trump started on the Hillary Clinton attacks early \u2013 and, several times in the speech, he also launched salvos against Warren, the Massachusetts senator whom some have floated as a possible running-mate for Clinton. \u201cShe\u2019s goofy,\u201d Trump said of Warren, echoing comments he made on Friday evening on Twitter. \u201cI think Hillary should pick her as a running-mate. I\u2019d love to run against her. \u201cBy the way, nobody respects women more,\u201d Trump said of himself, in a sing-song voice. \u201cDid you see what Hillary Clinton did to the women Bill had affairs with?\u201d Trump added. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going after me with women? Give me a break,\u201d he continued.   Related: Republicans plunged into five stages of grief over Trump's unstoppable rise    If Trump is going to re-tool his campaign to look more \u201cpresidential\u201d, as he has regularly promised to do in recent weeks, there was little sign of it in this speech, which retained much of the aggressive campaigning identity which has characterized his primary run. At the gates to the car park, a core group of several hundred protesters were still gathered, chanting: \u201cWhose streets? Our streets,\u201d when the speech ended. \u201cThose anti-fascist types coming out?\u201d one Trump supporter in a red Make America Great Again hat said, as they marched to the exit afterwards, which was blocked by protesters. \u201cI thought they were too poor to come out.\u201d  Other attendees talked about being \u201cready for a fight\u201d as they filed toward the exits, but the protest had a congenial atmosphere.  \u201cDude,\u201d one man wearing tie-dyed, harem pants shouted with disbelief at the people exiting the arena into the warm night. \u201cYou came here [to Oregon], got a Trump towel, but you didn\u2019t get any weed?\u201d",
