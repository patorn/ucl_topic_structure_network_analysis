  "body": "\u201cNever write the authorised biography,\u201d goes one media adage; you are likely to find the most savoury sections of your tale excised. Philip Norman\u2019s fulsome life of Paul McCartney, a companion to his biography of John Lennon, comes with \u201ctacit approval\u201d, meaning there was no interference from McCartney, but no cooperation either, Norman\u2019s 1981 Beatles history, Shout!, being deemed \u201canti-Paul\u201d (\u201cJohn Lennon was three quarters of the Beatles\u201d \u2013 that\u2019ll do it). McCartney has long nursed a clutch of grievances about the established mythology of the Beatles, foremost that\u00a0he is invariably portrayed as the \u201csafe\u201d, soft-centred obverse to John Lennon\u2019s acerbic, iconoclastic rocker; doe-eyed, \u201ccute\u201d Beatle Paul, handy with a melody and a bassline but lacking the fire and edginess of \u201cclever\u201d\u00a0Beatle John. This view was vigorously promoted by Lennon himself in the wake of the group\u2019s bust-up (and later upheld by Yoko Ono), brandishing Tomorrow Never Knows and A Day in the Life against \u201cgranny music\u201d like When I\u2019m Sixty-Four and Your Mother Should Know.    In the judgment of producer George Martin, 'John was lemon to Paul\u2019s olive oil.' The Beatles\u2019 magic required them both    Norman presents a different picture. In the squalid Hamburg residencies of the Beatles\u2019 early career, fuelled on booze and uppers, McCartney was an eager participant in the orgiastic craziness. Later, during the Fabs\u2019 mid-1960s peak, it was McCartney who immersed himself in the burgeoning London \u201cunderground\u201d, championing the Indica bookshop and gallery (where John first met Yoko), helping found International Times and exploring avant-garde composers like Stockhausen and Luciano Berio. Meanwhile Lennon, as Paul puts it, \u201cwas living on a golf course in bloody Weybridge\u201d. Nor was McCartney\u2019s music any less innovative than his partner\u2019s. Always the Beatles\u2019 most evolved musician and a keen student of classicism after lodging with the family of his actor girlfriend Jane Asher, he demanded a string quartet for Eleanor Rigby, while Penny Lane was as brilliant as Strawberry Fields. In the judgment of their equable producer George Martin, \u201cJohn was lemon to Paul\u2019s olive oil.\u201d The Beatles\u2019 magic required them both. McCartney had himself to blame for perceptions of his role, always playing Mr Nice Guy, developing an affable but vacuous interview technique that Norman aptly terms \u201csouffl\u00e9-speak\u201d. Steeped in antique pop by his beloved father, an amateur musician, McCartney was often led astray by sentimentalism during the solo career he doggedly built with Wings, though it delivered chart success (the vapid Silly Love Songs remains his biggest US hit).   Related: Paul McCartney strikes out to gain control of his share of the Beatles catalogue    As if atoning for his earlier misjudgment, Norman offers scant criticism of McCartney\u2019s erratic solo output, and diplomatically tiptoes around his subject\u2019s less appealing qualities \u2013 the abrupt dismissal of loyal\u00a0employees, the control-freakery that grated on the other Beatles, the close-handedness that saw Wings members paid a modest \u00a370 a week. Norman also stumbles when describing the social timbre of the 70s. The punk insurrection is presented in lamentably cliched terms \u2013 a froth of mohican cuts and safety pins \u2013 whereas a triple album of Wings Over America, the dreary waltz of Mull of Kintyre and videos of Paul and Linda on horseback, multimillionaires living an outworn hippy dream, were precisely why the Clash barking \u201cLondon\u2019s burning with boredom\u201d was so appealing. The spiteful harrying of Linda \u2013 he\u2019s got a woman in the band! \u2013 was likewise why female groups such as the Slits and Raincoats were so needed. Equally disconcerting is the assertion that Kate Bush\u2019s agile vocals on 1978\u2019s Wuthering Heights made Yoko\u2019s discordant wails \u201csound positively mainstream\u201d. Uh, no.    Paul\u2019s fondness for the demon weed provides a chaotic subplot in the story. Tokyo aside, there were several busts    Commercially, McCartney has rarely faltered down the years; even 1984\u2019s epically unfocused movie Give My Regards to Broad Street, in which \u201ca succession of distinguished actors struggled to provide plausibility\u201d, provided a No 1 album. His work rate has been relentless, the flow of albums, tours and collaborations never stalling. The 1990s brought his rediscovery by the Britpop generation alongside the Beatles Anthology for which he was the driving force. Even the death of Linda, the undoubted love of his life, seemed only to spur his productivity and a shift into classical pieces like Standing Stone. Given the landslide of books about the Fab Four, the dearth of fresh revelations here is unsurprising, though Norman provides the first full account of McCartney\u2019s highly uncomfortable nine days in a Japanese prison after Tokyo customs uncovered half a pound of marijuana in his baggage in 1980. Paul\u2019s fondness for the demon weed and the scrapes into which it led him and Linda provide a chaotic subplot in the story; Tokyo aside, there were several busts. At times the long and winding road carries on too far. The unhappy marriage to Heather Mills, spanning 80 pages and a blow-by-blow account of 2008\u2019s fractious divorce proceedings (\u201clegal Armageddon\u201d, remarked one lawyer), intrudes into a portrait of a gifted artist \u2013 the most successful songwriter of modern times \u2013 and a complex, contradictory personality. For all McCartney\u2019s ruthless business sense, he has maintained his dignity and decency. When vegetarian campaigner Peter Cox first met Paul, Cox was startled to be asked: \u201cHave you ever thought what power the Beatles could have had if we\u2019d gone over to the dark side?\u201d Thank heaven that the Fab Four\u00a0stuck with peace and love.
