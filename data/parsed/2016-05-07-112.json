  "body": "Watching Barack Obama and former House Speaker John Boehner swap stories and advice earlier this month for the next chapters in their lives, I was inspired to offer my own bipartisan overture to fellow Texan Ted Cruz as he ends his campaign for the presidency, returning to the slow retired country club of mostly old white men we call the US Senate. After all, I feel his pain \u2013 losing a big race that was closely watched around the country.  I won\u2019t go so far as to say that Ted and I have parallel paths. But we are both Texans; we both stood up for values that matter to us using lengthy filibusters (mine to make sure women received healthcare; his to make sure millions didn\u2019t); we both took to the campaign trail and fought with vigor for the opportunity to serve. And we both lost to guys who ran on an anti-immigrant platform.  While there are plenty of differences (too many for a single column), I am more than happy to share a few nuggets of wisdom I learned post-election with the Gentleman from Texas to help him readjust to life off-the-trail. Consider a hobby, but choose carefully Not cards. Maybe you\u2019ll be invited to play cards with some of the boys. But I would caution you that now is not the right time. Donald Trump \u201cplayed the woman card\u201d before you, and it isn\u2019t turning out so well for him. And he\u2019s already doing better than you are. Not travel (at least not to New York City). You may be tempted to get away with Heidi and the kids to see a Broadway show (I hear Hamilton is amazing). But given that \u201cNew York values\u201d comment you made, you may not be welcome there. Not reading the same old thing. You can really only read Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor once before it becomes clich\u00e9. I\u2019ve got a well-worn copy of The Feminine Mystique I can lend you. Maybe Twitter? I know it helped to propel Mr Trump to his ultimate victory in the Republican primary. Rest assured \u2013 you\u2019ll find kindred spirits online (we call yours \u201ctrolls\u201d, but that is neither here nor there). In fact, I\u2019ve made incredible friends on Twitter; @FullFrontalSamB and I were talking about you there just the other day actually! And I\u2019ve had insightful and amusing conversations with amazing change-makers like Ellen Page, Kerry Washington, Cecile Richards and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. I am sure that @AnnCoulter can\u2019t wait to dive deep into a high-minded and compelling Twitter discourse with you. Enjoy time with your friends Following my loss, I found solace and comfort with my daughters and friends. I know Heidi and the kids can\u2019t wait to have you home. Don\u2019t fret \u2013 Heidi will get over that elbow to her face after your campaign suspension speech the other night. Plus, now you can call up Carly \u2013 unless her friendship only lasts as long as her tenure as VP candidate, in which case you may be getting sent to her voicemail about as fast as you\u2019ll be sent to Paul Ryan\u2019s.  Speaking of which, I\u2019m sure your Senate colleagues will be thrilled to see you. Lindsay Graham said as much: \u201cIf you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\u201d Oh, wait. Surely he just meant, \u201cIf Ted Cruz killed it on the floor of the Senate\u2026\u201d Get back to work Your work friends are the perfect segue into my last bit of advice: embrace your job and work hard upon your return. I am sure that, like me, you embrace the calling to public service. While I had to resign from the Texas State Senate to run for governor, you didn\u2019t have to leave the US Senate to run for president.  That\u2019s great! It means you can jump right back into the critical work of legislating. With all the work that the Senate is doing right now \u2013 meeting with appointees to the US supreme court and holding hearings to confirm a new Secretary of the Army, passing budgets \u2013 wait, none of that is getting done. Well, you will fit right back in nonetheless given your penchant for shutting down the government when you don\u2019t get your way.  Perhaps 2017 will be better; think of how busy you\u2019ll be battling all those gender equity initiatives that Hillary Clinton will launch as president, advancing the revolutionary ideas of equal pay, reproductive autonomy and family leave policies! As for me, I\u2019ve been hard at work since my own run to build Deeds Not Words, a community of millennial women passionate about creating positive change (hopefully one of them will one day maneuver to take your job). In the meantime, though, think how fortunate you\u2019ll be to tell your grandchildren one day that you had the honor of serving under your nation\u2019s first woman president.",
