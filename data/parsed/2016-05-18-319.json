  "body": "Indigenous consumers lost more than $1.2m to scammers last year, an increase of nearly 65% compared with 2014, data from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has shown. Dating and romance scams caused the greatest monetary loss among Indigenous consumers, totalling more than $613,000. This loss was spread among just 15 people, according to the figures released on Tuesday.

Last year, the ABC reported that Indigenous people were being targeted by funeral companies building unnecessary and unfair costs into what were ultimately scam plans.  Rickard said there were two reasons why the money Indigenous people lost to scams had increased so much since 2014. \u201cWith social media and Facebook, it\u2019s so much easier for scammers to reach huge numbers of people,\u201d she said. \u201cOn top of that we have been working hard at building closer relationships with Indigenous communities and so hopefully we are reaching more people and they are reporting scams to us more often.\u201d",
