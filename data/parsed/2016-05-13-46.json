It\u2019s what she would have wanted.   Related: Receptionist 'sent home from PwC for not wearing high heels'    My mother was silly about shoes. She wore heels even for pounding the city pavements. Once in London, slightly exasperated with her as I often was, I made a cutting remark about her ridiculous tottering in her mad white heels: \u201cMum! You look like Joan bleeding Collins.\u201d My mother replied with an ecstatic grin and a hug: \u201cDeborah! I think that\u2019s the loveliest thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me.\u201d I let it lie. My mother believed that women should always wear as much heel as possible, and one of the sadnesses of getting older was having to compromise \u2013 three-inch heels eventually giving way to the utter indignity of two-inch rubber wedges. For shame. In winter Win would complain that she was going to \u201chave a fall\u201d on Motherwell\u2019s glassy ice. I took her to a camping shop and bought her stylish walking shoes with a formidable tread. I know she wore them once, because she told me that her young friend Walter had admired them. \u201cAll my nice shoes, and these are the ones he made a remark on,\u201d she reported, with disgust and some wonder. \u201cThere\u2019s no accounting for taste.\u201d After she was dead, I found them in an upstairs cabinet, as new. I gave them to my friend Mary, who was delighted to acquire them.   Related: Can\u2019t do heels? Don\u2019t do Cannes | Hadley Freeman    Nicola Thorp, temporary receptionist, is more of a Mary than a Win. She\u2019s the 27-year-old who objected to her agency\u2019s dress code, which demanded that women should wear high heels, and so launched a petition demanding that women should never be forced to wear high heels for any reason. In the few days since, all corporately concerned have caved in and her petition has now gained parliamentary attention. To which you can only say: \u201cWTF?\u201d Except that this happened at Cannes last year too, when officials at the film festival took umbrage at the fact that women were sullying the red carpet with bejewelled flats. The dress code at Cannes is black tie, always has been, always will be, they insisted \u2013 talking as if women and their accessories were the accessories of men and their accessories. Which, admittedly, in the main they have always been, until recent times. The French, however, should know better. Before the revolution, the French court set the fashion for Europe\u2019s aristocracy, and both men and women wore heels. (As men and women did in ancient Egypt.) This isn\u2019t hard to understand. Heels were a perfect status symbol, a very direct signal that you were beyond such quotidian matters as walking to get to places. Obviously, when you started having to run to keep your head, the head\u2019s priority over the heels became all too apparent. So why, now, can a man be smartly, even formally dressed but deliciously mobile and comfy, while in regressive corners of the west a woman still cannot? In her book How to Be a Woman, Caitlin Moran got some stick for suggesting that heels made women less able to run away from assailants. The gist of the criticism was that it\u2019s up to men to stop attacking women, rather than for women to get better at escaping from men who attack them. Yet while I agree with this, I also agree with Moran. I think that the enduring attraction of heels is in part to do with ideas about femininity and vulnerability. Women continue to wear heels because they think they can afford to be vulnerable, and that\u2019s still a weird, messed-up status signaller in itself. Because it\u2019s a hangover from the days when women were expected to be vulnerable, and not expected to work, or walk without a gentlemanly arm to hang on to, or to have much of a life beyond the domestic sphere at all.   Related: It\u2019s confirmed \u2013 men are mesmerised by high heels. Except me, that is | Ally Fogg    Sure, fierce heels have come to be seen as powerful and sexy. But, really, that\u2019s about being a woman who feels so in control that she\u2019s simply not going to find herself in any situation she might be expected to run away from. (I mean, if you don\u2019t run away from bunions, corns, heel spurs and fallen arches, what the hell do you fear?) The truth, however, is that women are hobbled by their heels. They have the power, not us. It\u2019s the master-slave dialectic, innit? We own them. But they are in charge. We love heels even though we know they\u2019re bad for us. We even pretend we love shoes more than we do, keeping lots of shoes we hardly ever wear with the excuse that \u201cI\u2019m just crazy about shoes!\u201d \u2013 when the truth is that at least 70% are just mistakes, shoes we thought we could wear in a moment of craving in the shop, then found on their first outing that this was far from the case. There\u2019s sometimes quite a long hiatus between discovering that a pair of shoes cripple you and forgetting the pain enough to try again. The same charade, I suspect, is rarely performed a third time. And when you find a pair of gorgeous heels that are also, by a wondrous alignment of nature and design, actually comfortable \u2013 well, that is the joy of joys, the holy grail of shoe shopping, the ultimate sartorial triumph. God, women can be daft. Nicola Thorp, though? Temporary receptionist and permanent feminist hero, no question. Women need the inalienable right to wear flats if they wish to. And the inalienable right, of course, to wear heels if they wish to. But maybe we should all bear in mind a bit more that heels actually wear us, in every possible way.",
