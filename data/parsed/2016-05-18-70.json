  "body": "Labour peer David Puttnam has praised the prime minister and chancellor for \u201cseeing off an ideological agenda\u201d regarding the BBC in this month\u2019s white paper. In what will widely be interpreted as a criticism of culture secretary John Whittingdale, Puttnam told the Media Show on Radio 4 that there had been an attempt to impose an ideological agenda on the corporation.    Related: Cameron's intervention ends wrangling over BBC's future    \u201cI think there was an attempt to run an ideological agenda that, I think, has failed,\u201d he said. \u201cI put that absolutely to the credit of the chancellor and prime minister. I think the prime minister and chancellor saw off an ideological agenda.\u201d There was a degree of relief for the BBC and its supporters earlier this month when a number of measures floated before the white paper\u2019s publication, such as restrictions on scheduling and top-slicing of the licence fee, did not appear in the final document.  However, Puttnam said parliament would \u201cseverely\u201d oppose plans for the government to appoint four directors on a new BBC board, in addition to the chair and deputy chair.     David Puttnam has said parliament would oppose the plans for a new BBC board. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock    \u201cI think the idea of four of the board being appointed by the government is a dreadful idea,\u201d said Puttnam, who is charing an inquiry into public service broadcasting. \u201cI just think it makes no sense. \u201cI\u2019m not just saying this as a Labour peer: don\u2019t forget my party could just as easily be in power and I would be saying exactly the same thing. \u201cIf it did happen it would unquestionably have a chilling affect on broadcasting ... The public quite legitimately are quite suspicious of the way board appointments occur. \u201cIt would be very, very severely challenged in parliament. This is not going to go away, this is not going to be brushed under the carpet. \u201cI think it will end up being major, major issue in parliament, and I know for a fact there are many many Conservatives, people who I like a lot, who will oppose this bitterly.\u201d He added that if the government exerted too much control over who ran the BBC, the corporation could end up like Italian state-owned broadcaster RAI, where the organisation\u2019s leadership is replaced with each change in government. \u201cIf we even begin to countenance that kind of interference,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s game over.\u201d",
