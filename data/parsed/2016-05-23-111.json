  "body": "Earlier today I set you the following dot-to-dot puzzles. You had to draw lines between the dots, with the constraint that the number by the dot determines the number of lines joining that dot.     Linking park    I also said that any two dots can be linked by at most one line, and that for the 3-dot and 4-dot hexagons no lines could cross. Here are a set of solutions, but there are others.     A hexagon in braces skipping, a hexagon in braces and a sash showing off and a star.    The last challenge was to fill in this one with only two \u2018repeat\u2019 lines, which repeat a link between two dots.     Who eight the dots?    Here\u2019s a solution. Again, there are variations.     Repeated lines in red.    Thanks again to James Tanton, co-founder of The Global Math Project, for these puzzles.  I post a puzzle here on a Monday every two weeks.
