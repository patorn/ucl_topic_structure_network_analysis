Now, the character\u2019s high-contrast, minimalist adventures are concluding with the hero ending his days where he began them: hell itself, where Mignola says he has found unexpected artistic freedom. The final issue ships this Wednesday, 1 June. Over nearly 22 years writing and drawing Hellboy \u2013 the first comic was published in October 1994 \u2013 Mignola has won virtually every major award in comics, some of them several times. Now, he says, he wants to narrow his focus still further. Mignola has cleared his schedule so he can take up watercolor painting, which is not a medium he\u2019s used to. In conversation, Mignola is a good-humored pessimist, his dire expectations perpetually thwarted by what he calls an incredible run of good luck. He still speaks with amazement about being surprised by the best in the midst of preparing for the worst, whether he was creating a spare character in case everyone hated Hellboy or getting green lights for movies he was certain would fall apart.     Mike Mignola: \u2018It\u2019s been at least 25 years since I didn\u2019t have jobs lined up\u2019 Photograph: Christine Mignola/Supplied    What made you decide to call it a day? Hellboy in Hell, as originally conceived, was radically different than what I ended up doing. My thing of getting him off the world into hell was just so I could do these stories where he rambles around. But even by the end of issue five, I started realizing: \u201cThere\u2019s this one big story we\u2019re telling.\u201d I tried to do standalone stories, but I\u2019d had him kill off Satan, which I somehow thought wasn\u2019t going to be a big deal, but the weight of that thing took over the book. So originally it was going to go on forever, and then it was going to be four books, and then I replotted it so it was three \u2026 And I guess by the end of issue eight, which is out, he\u2019s sitting under a tree and it just suddenly felt like, \u201cOh. This is the end of the series.\u201d There\u2019s one big thing he has left to do, or maybe two. I\u2019ve been surprised at how pleasant hell is, in your comics. My version of the real world isn\u2019t all that realistic \u2013 there aren\u2019t all that many cars \u2013 but I wanted to throw Hellboy into a world that was entirely made of all the things I would draw if I had no job and could just draw whatever I wanted. Those cities, those people, those semi-transparent giant insects, all those sorts of things.  So taking the year to do these paintings is a pretty natural transition. It\u2019s kind of like stripping Hellboy out of it, stripping the storytelling out. That\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m really kind of looking forward to, just saying, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a picture of a guy. We don\u2019t have to know who that guy is. It\u2019s a picture of a building. We don\u2019t have to figure out what\u2019s going on in that building.\u201d Really, I\u2019ve never done it. You\u2019re a painter full-time now? Yeah, I\u2019m painting and drawing. I think the drawing in the comic is fine, but none of the drawings get the kind of focus you would be doing if you were just doing a painting or a standalone drawing. Some part of me started saying, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s been good that you\u2019ve been able to do some stuff as a cartoonist writing and drawing your own stuff, but you always kind of wanted to be an artist.\u201d And I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been doing artwork that\u2019s up to what I could do if I focused all my energies on it.  What do you want to do that you can\u2019t do with that attention divided? I just want to see if I can be good at it. I\u2019ve been doing roughly one painting a year. Generally they\u2019ve been commercial \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been painting for fun. With repetition, I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019ll get better at it. It\u2019s been at least 25 years since I didn\u2019t have jobs lined up, so the idea of waking up and saying, \u201cWhat am I going to do new today?\u201d is pretty exciting.     Hell tonight: Hellboy\u2019s concluding comic. Photograph: Dark Horse    Is gouache your medium now, like your cover paintings for the Hellboy novels? The paintings I generally do are a watercolor/gouache combination, so all these harsh, deliberate shapes I do in comics, that becomes blur and mush and transparency and accident. Watercolor is hard to control. At some point you\u2019re putting color on to a wet piece of paper and that color is going to interact with the other colors and it\u2019s going to do stuff with the water, and that\u2019s scary but it\u2019s also exciting. It\u2019s the flipside of doing the really controlled black and white stuff. I\u2019m looking forward to embracing that, and doing pictures of ghosts where there are places where you go, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking at! Maybe that\u2019s an arm, but there also seems to be ivy there!\u201d You can\u2019t get that in black and white. Are there plans to do Hellboy in any other media? Occasionally there are still some discussions about film or TV, but I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. There\u2019s nothing I can do to make those things happen. I constantly get those people saying, \u201cAre you going to make another movie? Make them do this! Make them do that!\u201d I can\u2019t make them do anything! Do people go crazy about the property, given how fondly the movies are remembered? Every time Ron Perlman does an interview and says, \u201cLet\u2019s do Hellboy 3!\u201d I get bombarded with people who say: \u201cRon says it\u2019s happening!\u201d Ron has as much power on this thing as I do, which is none. I appreciate that level of enthusiasm, but please don\u2019t anybody ever again talk to me about doing a Kickstarter. We\u2019re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars; I don\u2019t see raising it in nickels and dimes. \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not making a third one? Those movies were so good!\u201d They didn\u2019t make a lot of money, and that\u2019s one of the big things people look for.  The fact that you got two of them was a miracle. You want $80m to make a movie starring Ron Perlman and it\u2019s called Hellboy! How the hell did that thing ever get made? It shows the power of [Guillermo] del Toro. Back then, he was just a super enthusiastic guy who\u2019d made a couple of pretty funky monster movies. But he was persuasive as hell and he fought like a dog to get these things made.

I\u2019d love for it to be in some way kind of faithful to the comic, and if it\u2019s a horrific, complete departure, I won\u2019t be thrilled, but you have to make peace with these things. Back when Dark Horse optioned it from me and put it into development, I thought: \u201cThis is the greatest scam I\u2019m ever going to run! You\u2019re going to give me money so you can maybe make a movie, but we all know you\u2019re never going to make the movie, so you\u2019re going to pay me money again, for nothing? That\u2019s great!\u201d  [But] then when they actually made the movie, holy shit. Now it\u2019s scary. When I signed the option deal for Hellboy, being me, I assumed the absolute worst. What if they do make it, and it\u2019s horrible beyond anything I can possibly imagine? It\u2019s going to make Howard the Duck look like Gone With the Wind. I thought: \u201cOh, no. I\u2019ve just got Hellboy up and running, and this movie could completely sink the name Hellboy forever. There\u2019ll be so much stink on it!\u201d So I made up a new character and everything I had planned to do with Hellboy, I could roll over into this other character. What was the name of the new character? We eventually started doing it as a comic: Joe Golem, Occult Detective. I made up this golem character I was going to do as a comic, and then I was going to do it as a novel, but really it was sitting off to the side, waiting for Hellboy to tank huge. For a long time he was just sitting on the sidelines, as my lifeboat. And you never got to leap into him. No, I didn\u2019t need to! When the movie didn\u2019t destroy Hellboy, I was going to do Joe Golem as a comic, and I was living in New York. Two weeks before I started, I wanted to scout out all the locations and take photos, and I\u2019m looking down 7th Avenue like, \u201cThat\u2019s the establishing shot for the first page,\u201d and 9/11 happens. Suddenly the idea of doing a book about a partially sunken New York City in ruins was really unappealing. I go: \u201cWell, you\u2019re going back on the shelf.\u201d Where did the seed of Hellboy come from originally? I\u2019d had a falling out with Marvel and I went to DC. I did a one-issue Batman story that I plotted myself. It was a straight-up Batman supernatural story and I had a lot of fun doing it. It really felt like a turning point. If I can do stories that really reflect me, do I continue to do these stories and try to shoehorn other people\u2019s characters in? Really, if I\u2019m going to make up my own stories, why don\u2019t I make up my own guy? When will we get to see your paintings? If you come by the house, you can see them. I hadn\u2019t given it any thought. Ideally, I\u2019m working on this stuff for a year, and certainly if anything good shows up, I\u2019ll post it on Facebook or I\u2019ll put it on our website, because I\u2019m not one of those guys that\u2019s gonna be content to say, \u201cOh, they\u2019re just for me,\u201d which is apparently what you hear about [Calvin and Hobbes creator] Bill Watterson \u2013 he\u2019s just painting for himself. If I do anything halfway good, I want everybody to see it.",
