She had always worked for other people in the hospitality business, had run someone else\u2019s catering company, but what came next?   \u201cI needed a challenge,\u201d she says. She decided to go it alone and, at the beginning of May, celebrated the 10th year of Zar Bar, her busy hole-in-the-wall cafe in Sydney\u2019s Crows Nest. \u201cI love the freedom, the being in control of my own destiny,\u201d she says. \u201cI love the ongoing connections I form with customers, the people who stop by for coffee on their way home from the gym or on their way to work.\u201d  Those connections are stronger, warmer, she believes because the business is hers: a wage-earning barista wouldn\u2019t invest so much, or get the emotional returns. Before the 2016 budget was handed down, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, flagged that it would contain incentives for people to get ahead of the \u201ctransitioning economy\u201d and go it alone like Bingham. And it did: tax reductions, eased payment instalment procedures, and more for companies with turnovers of $10m, increasing annually to $100m in 2020.   Related: Corporate tax cuts to cost budget $5.3bn over four years    With so many traditional jobs going overseas where labour is cheaper, or being replaced by technology, it sounds like a plan. In January, the World Economic Forum predicted that 5 million jobs would be lost by 2020 \u2013 7 million lost and 2 million created \u2013 in the 15 countries, including Australia and representing 65% of the world\u2019s total workforce, it surveyed. But is everyone equipped to go freelance or start a small business? And is the transition to an enterprise-based society as inevitable as it sounds? \u201cObviously entrepreneurialism and new business are really important for dynamic economies,\u201d says Peter Gahan, director of the Centre for Workplace Leadership at the university of Melbourne. \u201cTypically most innovation doesn\u2019t come from established firms, it comes from new ones. \u201cThere is however, a range of cautionary notes around encouraging everyone to become their own entrepreneur. We know that there are a range of skills and personal attributes that are really important for success as a self-employed person. Not everyone has the attributes and not everyone has the skills. Some people are capable of learning the skills, but many are not.\u201d We\u2019re sold the idea of startups as a cool step towards wealth and fame but the bulk of self-employed are tradies and corner shopkeepers, as well as more upmarket barristers and medical specialists who traditionally work freelance \u2013 not hipster Silicon Valley types. What\u2019s more, Gahan warns that up to 50% of small businesses go bust in their first year. Skills and personal attributes again. A substantial number of people who start small businesses have no qualifications beyond secondary school, he says, and, worse, may have no technical or business management training Peter Strong, of the Small Business Association, is less pessimistic. He questions ABS figures for small-business failures that academics quote: he puts the numbers closer to 10% to 15%, saying that many closures are \u201cvoluntary exits, not due to insolvency\u201d. There are many reasons those going it alone may choose \u201cvoluntary exit\u201d. Freelancing can mean struggling to pay the rent; small business can mean working day and night; and everyone has ongoing cash flow problems. And that\u2019s not to start on the vagaries of the market for their services.   Related: Your tax dollars: how is the government spending your money in the 2016 federal budget?    Working for the man might be restrictive, even demeaning, but it is secure and, as workers get older, they can safely plan for a mortgage and a family, or whatever life path they choose, and for retirement. Traditional jobs give entitlements \u2013 annual leave, sick leave, superannuation and more \u2013 that owner-operators can\u2019t give themselves. On the other hand, the knowledge that you are in control, that you can turn down that job or that commission \u2013 even if you don\u2019t because you can\u2019t afford to \u2013 can be liberating. The trick, as everyone who has tried it knows, is to organise time for the rest of life: to socialise, exercise and pursue private pleasures. The demands of self-employment impose their own limits, however. Bingham says there is no way she could run her tiny business if she were raising children. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do both well,\u201d she says. This shift to individualistic entrepreneurialism has been a long time coming: in its latest guise at least since Margaret Thatcher called for an enterprise culture in the 1980s. But it goes back further than that. \u201cIn the 19th century, we had exactly everything that the prime minister is advocating,\u201d says John Buchanan, an expert in business analytics and work-life transitioning at the university of Sydney. \u201cDaily hire, what we now call casual, was endemic. And it was generally recognised to be a very unstable way to live.\u201d And yet, it does seem that the combined effects of globalisation and technological change are making the shift inevitable. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing inevitable,\u201d Buchanan says firmly. \u201cThe forms employment takes are politically determined by the policies society adopts. \u201cIf there\u2019s an increase in this kind of thing, it\u2019s not being driven by people\u2019s preferences or labour supply, but because labour is being fundamentally restructured.\u201d Bingham says that although she revels in her freedom, it is limited freedom. Her income is higher than it was before and she can afford someone to come in for four hours a day to help out, but it is nothing like the paid holiday that advocates of do-what-you-love independence spruik. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t like to work hard shouldn\u2019t go out on their own,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll find yourself working harder than you\u2019ve ever worked. And it\u2019s all down to you \u2013 you can\u2019t leave things for the next person coming on shift.\u201d Hours can be punishing, books must be kept, rent and staff wages take a chunk out of profits.  \u2018The best piece of advice I was given was, \u2018Don\u2019t mortgage your home to fund your business,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThen, if it goes south, you still have somewhere to live.\u201d",
