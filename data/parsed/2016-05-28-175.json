  "body": "Maryam Golding rarely gets her three eldest sons together round the dinner table at her small west London flat. Her boys have extraordinary reasons to be busy. The last time the whole family was crowded into the living room, her middle son was celebrating winning the Sword of Honour at Sandhurst, his younger brother was between performances with the Royal Ballet and his older brother, an artist, was back from a sell-out residency in Dubai. Raised in a Tottenham council house, all troublemakers at school, the three have gone on to penetrate some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions: Solomon, 22, is the first black British male dancer in the Royal Ballet, Kidane, 24, rose through basic army training to graduate with the top prize at the Royal Military Academy in April and Amartey, 27, has the patronage of the Dubai royal family. The brothers credit their mother with bringing them up to believe that the world was theirs for the taking. \u201cI never felt that being disadvantaged was how I was defined,\u201d Solomon says. \u201cWe are fiercely proud \u2013 we didn\u2019t feel like these institutions were worlds away. No one should have to stay in their lane or accept their lot. We travelled, we heard stories of such rich experiences and history.\u201d     Maryam Golding.    Maryam is an African historian, social worker and practising Rastafarian (as well as the three brothers she also has a daughter and another son still at home). It was her passion for art and dance that inspired Amartey and Solomon and her iron discipline that convinced Kidane the\u00a0army could never be tougher than\u00a0home. \u201cHe said the woman sergeant-major wasn\u2019t as scary as me,\u201d says Maryam. Kidane rolls his eyes. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a sergeant-major. She was a bombardier. Yeah, it\u2019s true though.\u201d Though other newspapers have told the story of her sons, Maryam has stayed out of the limelight until now and contacted the Guardian. She says she has decided to speak out because she feels part of their story has been overlooked \u2013 how mixed-race, working-class young men like them are so often discriminated against and demonised. This is not the simple story of bad boys being made good by the discipline of the army or a dance company. \u201cWe raised them conscious of their identities,\u201d she says. \u201cWe spoke about Ethiopia\u2019s history as an independent kingdom which had never been colonised. They loved The Three Musketeers so we spoke about how Alexandre Dumas was mixed race. You drop it in \u2013 you don\u2019t sit them down and explain it. Each of my children has taken it to different paths.\u201d Born in south London and expelled twice from convent schools, Maryam spent her 20s as a community worker, working with women and girls in Tottenham, north London. When the funding was cut, she went to the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) to study African history. Her father had served in the Royal Artillery during the second world war and later ran a newspaper in Ethiopia, where he had an audience with Haile Selassie. The emperor made a lasting impression on him, something Maryam absorbed; and she in turn was determined to bring up her children with an understanding of their heritage as mixed-race British children.    When you\u2019re mixed race, to know the black culture and history you have inside of you is really important and really rich  Kidane Cousland     On the walls and shelves of the family home, as well as Amartey\u2019s prints and photographs of Solomon in his leotard, are treasures from their travels to Jamaica and their years in Ghana. \u201cWhen you\u2019re mixed race, living in London \u2013 and you do have to face a lot of prejudice \u2013 to know the black culture and history you have inside of you is also really important and really rich, it allows you to develop a strong identity,\u201d says Kidane. Despite their rich cultural life, the family often had very little. \u201cIt was secondhand market clothes. I used to make them African outfits with knitted hats,\u201d says Maryam. All three boys were exceptionally close to her Jamaican husband, Ras I Golding. Though their biological father was Ghanaian, Golding is the man they consider their dad and also the father of their two youngest siblings. All have taken his surname except Kidane, who uses Maryam\u2019s maiden name, Cousland. Golding died in 2009 and all three boys cite him as a major influence on their chosen paths. When the children were young, the family moved to Jamaica and later Ghana, where Amartey and Kidane say they experienced a different kind of racism. \u201cIn Ghana, they would call us white. And you realise you\u2019re not black or white \u2013 you just have to roll with it. From a young age, you realise people try to put you in boxes and we don\u2019t fit. So we made our own boxes.\u201d     Kidane Cousland was awarded the Sword of Honour at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in April 2016. Photograph: Cpl Jamie Dudding/Army    Back in the UK, it was tough for the family who spent time living in a bug-infested bed and breakfast, while the three boys struggled in mainstream education. Amartey moved away from the family to the YMCA in Cambridge and later went to art school \u2013 Central Saint Martins in London \u2013 and Solomon joined the Royal Ballet School. Kidane was 16 and in the marine cadets, about to resit his GCSEs, when he joined the army. \u201cAt school, I wasn\u2019t the best at anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI found the knack to soldiering was being prepared to work harder than anyone else. Work harder, endure more cold or crawl into the nastiest smelling bush to hide, that would be success. And I was always prepared to go through more agony than anyone else. If that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a calling or a passion, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he says.     Solomon Golding rehearsing with the Royal Ballet. Photograph: Royal Opera House    \u201cI knew that I didn\u2019t have the academic background to be an officer \u2013 I was heavily dyslexic. So I thought, I\u2019ll join and get commissioned from the\u00a0ranks, like Sharpe. I watched a lot of Sharpe.\u201d Though very much now a model soldier, a sharp dresser with closely cropped hair, a stark contrast to three of his siblings\u2019 and mother\u2019s Rastafarian dreads, Kidane says he has not compromised the values he was brought up with. \u201cI think it has been about wanting to succeed on my own terms. I have been vegetarian my entire career, even though people expressed concern about that, through arduous physical training courses, commando training, in a six-month-tour of Afghanistan, not just keeping up but being better.\u201d For his mother, to watch him be admitted and then excel at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst has been \u201cbittersweet, if I\u2019m honest\u201d, Maryam admits. \u201cI\u2019m still conflicted. I was worried, of course, when he went into the officer training. Discrimination in that class structure can be more insidious because it\u2019s not, \u2018I\u2019m going to smash your face in.\u2019 But at the ball, he couldn\u2019t move for people shaking his hand. And I do think it is worthwhile for people to have him as a role model.\u201d Solomon found ballet school difficult at first. Aged 10, he had been attending classes for a little over six months when his teacher called round to the house to tell him to apply for the\u00a0school. Before that, his dancing had been limited to teaching his school\u00a0friends Spice Girl routines in the\u00a0playground. Once he started classes as a beginner, Solomon says he always felt something was holding him back. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel racism per se, but I felt like an outsider because I was so new to ballet. I didn\u2019t know the history of ballet, of composers, of choreographers. It\u2019s weird to think that there were 11-year-olds established in the ballet world, but there were. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the first clue and they made me feel like I didn\u2019t want or care about it enough because I didn\u2019t know these things. I was coming top three in my class and not being cast in the front. Then I was the only one in the year who got into the Royal Ballet.\u201d The establishment awaits the three brothers now, with Kidane an army officer, Solomon starring in A Winter\u2019s Tale at the Royal Opera House, and Amartey back from his time as an artist-in-residence for Sheikha Lateefa bint Maktoum of Dubai, after numerous sell-out exhibitions, and his next project set to be an artistic collaboration with Solomon. \u201cDubai has a huge art market, loads of galleries, but no one there is actually making art,\u201d he says. \u201cThe residency gave me creative space to develop. Now I have the freedom to do exhibitions I really care about.\u201d     Morning of the Sacrifice by Amartey Golding. Photograph: Amartey Golding    Recent weeks have been a whirlwind for the family since they stood at Sandhurst\u2019s Old College Square, watching Kidane receive one of the British military\u2019s highest honours, ahead of all the Oxbridge graduates, and the full story of the family\u2019s impressive achievements began to trickle out. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been extraordinary,\u201d Amartey laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that. And this is just the beginning. In this small family, we all keep each other balanced, keep everything in perspective.\u201d For Maryam, the successes of her children are important not just for the family, but for the path she feels they are forging for others. \u201cMy husband always said he didn\u2019t want the kids to just do well, he wanted them to break down barriers. And they are.\u201d",
