  "body": "This book is about a girl called Tiga Whicabim who lives in the shed with a horrible old lady. One day, Tiga discovers a fairy who takes her down the sink pipes for witch wars. I think children aged around 6 would enjoy this book because it has such a fantastic plot and it is easy to read.  I liked Witch Wars because it was about a competition, and competitions are really fun to read about. I also liked seeing which characters would be disqualified from the witch wars as the plot progressed.      Witch Wars    I give this book three stars out of five. I didn\u2019t like it as much as other books I\u2019ve read recently, like Murder Most Unladylike by Robin Stevens.
