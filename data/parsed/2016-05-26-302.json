  "body": "The subtitle of the Icelandic writer Sj\u00f3n\u2019s jewel-like novella is \u201cthe boy who never was\u201d. Known to English-speaking readers for a series of beautiful short works written and translated in the 2000s, Sj\u00f3n (a pen name that means \u201csight\u201d, shortened from his given name Sigurj\u00f3n Birgir Sigur\u00f0sson) has been involved in Reykjav\u00edk\u2019s literary scene since the late 1970s, when he was part of a milieu of young underground artists and musicians that eventually gave rise to the Sugarcubes. The subsequent career of that band\u2019s lead singer, Bj\u00f6rk, has cemented the Icelandic aesthetic in the international imagination as a fusion of hard-edged modernist experimentation with a kind of folkloric whimsy. Sj\u00f3n, who has written lyrics (and occasionally played air-guitar) for his elfin friend, shares both these qualities. The \u201cboy who never was\u201d is one M\u00e1ni Steinn Karlsson, a 16-year-old who has sex with men for money in Reykjav\u00edk. The year is 1918, and M\u00e1ni\u2019s reality is unstable, infected by cinema, always threatening to tip over into dream. In Sj\u00f3n\u2019s telling, this story is neither a fairytale, nor a study of abjection. M\u00e1ni often enjoys his encounters, and his love of the cinema leads him to Irma Vep, the anti-heroine of Louis Feuillade\u2019s seven-hour epic crime movie, Les Vampires, in which an \u201ceponymous gang of nihilists ... hold French society in the grip of fear\u201d. Irma, who wears a fetishistic black bodysuit (unthinkably shocking for 1915, when the film was made), \u201cscales buildings like a shadow and breaks into apartments and government offices before making her escape over the rooftops\u201d. Like the boy dreaming about her from his seat in one of the city\u2019s two cinemas, she is outside society, committing her crimes \u201cwith the cheerful zeal of one who has turned her back on the laws of her fellow men\u201d. M\u00e1ni finds his own Irma in S\u00f3la G, a motorbike-riding girl in black leather who seems to have escaped from the screen into the more mundane register of his daily life.    Sj\u00f3n\u2019s prose is never histrionic or overwrought, balancing rage and hallucination with a gentleness of spirit    Irma Vep was crucial to the imagination of the French surrealists, and Sj\u00f3n uses her and S\u00f3la to explore the ways in which fantasy shapes reality, how dreams and imagination work powerfully on the everyday. When the global influenza pandemic arrives in Iceland with the docking of the steam ship Botnia, people begin to die and the city empties, its deserted public spaces becoming playgrounds for M\u00e1ni\u2019s imagination. The cinemas, already under fire from church leaders for leading the impressionable young into sexual temptation, are now dangerous sites of contagion. One by one, the musicians who accompany the performances fall ill, until finally \u201cthe last person in Reykjav\u00edk capable of picking out a tune\u201d faints, the lights go up, and the audience looks around to realise that many among them are sick. As the influenza tightens its grip, M\u00e0ni starts to work as an assistant to a doctor, driven in a motor car from one scene of suffering to the next by the enigmatic S\u00f3la G. It is as if his subconscious has broken its bounds: \u201cNo matter how distressing the scenes, the boy remains impassive ... Reykjav\u00edk has, for the first time, assumed a form that reflects his inner life: a fact he would not confide to anyone.\u201d At times M\u00e1ni threatens to dissipate in an almost physical way. \u201cHe dissolves his body, turning solid into liquid, beginning from within and rinsing it all out.\u201d Like Irma, he is a shadow, one that \u201cpasses from man to man, and no one is complete until he has cast him\u201d. For the solid citizens who pay him for sex, he is the unacknowledged supplement to their identity, the aspect of themselves that they can only claim in silence and darkness. As M\u00e1ni\u2019s own dark dreams colonise his waking reality, the distinction between the fetishised \u201clight puppets\u201d of the movies and the victims of the pandemic disappears completely. S\u00f3la and M\u00e1ni, \u201cdressed in black from top to toe, with black gauzes over their noses and mouths and dark goggles over their eyes\u201d, fumigate a cinema with chlorine, doubling a scene in Les Vampires, where the nihilists rob a roomful of socialites by incapacitating them with knock-out gas. Chlorine gas is also a weapon that has recently caused devastation on the western front. The new century\u2019s nightmare of technological warfare enters the auditorium, providing yet another doubling, another note to reverberate in the echo chamber of Sj\u00f3n\u2019s tautly constructed narrative. M\u00e1ni is, of course, a fictional character, a \u201cboy who never was\u201d, but Sj\u00f3n uses him to tell a story that turns out to be very personal, in ways that don\u2019t emerge until the very end of the book. The cheerful sexual outlaw surrounded by infection is a figure we know only too well from the Aids epidemic, and Moonstone is, among other things, an elegy. Though it is a deeply felt novel, Sj\u00f3n\u2019s prose is never histrionic or overwrought, balancing rage and hallucination (there are echoes of Artaud and Ballard) with a gentleness of spirit, an affection for precision and the small scale. The result is sure to delight his fans and convert many new ones. \u2022 Hari Kunzru\u2019s latest book is Gods Without Men (Penguin).
