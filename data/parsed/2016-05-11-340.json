  "body": "The New South Wales Liberal party has said that no decision on preferences for the upcoming federal election has been made, leaving open the option to preference the Greens in key Sydney marginal seats. According to reports, Victorian Liberal party director Michael Kroger is considering a deal in which the Liberals will preference the Greens in the seats of Batman and Wills in return for the Greens not preferencing the ALP in a clutch of outer-suburban marginal seats, a move that would give the Liberals a stronger chance of winning them. On Wednesday, Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, said the Victorian deal had spilled over into NSW and \u201cit seems the Liberals will be preferencing the Greens\u201d in Anthony Albanese\u2019s seat of Grayndler and her seat of Sydney. Asked to rule out a deal to preference the Greens in those seats, a spokeswoman for the NSW Liberals referred Guardian Australia to federal director Tony Nutt\u2019s statement that \u201cno decisions have been made regarding preferences\u201d.   Related: Labor and Liberals accuse each other of collaborating with Greens    \u201cDuring elections, various parties have discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is standard process and speculation that any particular party, group or individual has some deal, arrangement or understanding is false.\u201d A decision on preferences will be made after nominations close and \u201cobviously self-interested positioning by our political opponents\u201d would not influence the process, Nutt said. The Greens candidate for Grayndler, Jim Casey, told Guardian Australia: \u201cI have absolutely no idea what the Liberals are going to do ... if they choose to preference the Greens, that\u2019s up to them.\u201d \u201cUntil local [Greens] groups have met and made their decisions, I can\u2019t know how their preferences will be arranged except that the Greens won\u2019t preference the Liberals,\u201d he said. Electoral analyst and Guardian Australia election blogger, Ben Raue, said: \u201cLiberal preferences are crucial to the Greens winning in Grayndler and Sydney, but they\u2019re not enough. \u201cThey would also need to overtake the Liberal party, who came second in 2013, and would still need a swing towards them and away from Labor to win, even with Liberal preferences.\u201d Raue said: \u201cWhen the Liberal party preferenced the Greens over Labor in 2010, the Greens received 74-81% of Liberal preferences. \u201cThis dropped to 28-34% of Liberal preferences in 2013, when the Liberal party favoured Labor.\u201d Returning preference flows from the Liberals to the levels the Greens enjoyed in 2010 may be the difference between the Greens candidates ousting Labor and not. Raue said, unlike Sydney and Grayndler, the Greens are already ahead of the Liberal party in Batman and Wills.  \u201cThe margins in those seats are 10.6% and 15.2%, but if the Liberal party reverses its preference decision, the Labor margin in Wills would be cut to 4.4%, and in Batman the race would start out as a tie.\u201d On Wednesday, the Murdoch tabloid the Daily Telegraph intervened in the Grayndler contest by urging its readers to \u201cSave Our Albo\u201d. Casey, who is the secretary of the NSW Fire Brigade Employees\u2019 Union, made light of the endorsement by posing with the newspaper:    Been busy here today at Balmain Fire Station. Only just had a chance to check the papers. pic.twitter.com/dObgF0PpOf\u2014 Jim Casey (@JimCaseyGreens) May 11, 2016    At a campaign stop in the western Sydney marginal seat of Greenway, Albanese talked up the risk of a deal which would see Liberal preferences go to the Greens. \u201cThe Greens, at this election, are seeking to do arrangements with the Liberals in electorates such as mine, and in return offering to issue open tickets that will increase chances of Turnbull government being re-elected,\u201d he said. Albanese criticised the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, for spending the first day of the campaign in his seat. \u201cDuring this campaign I\u2019ll be out trying to defeat the Coalition, while the Greens are trying to defeat me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is disappointing that the Greens, who say they want a progressive Australia, are targeting progressives not conservative in this election.\u201d",
