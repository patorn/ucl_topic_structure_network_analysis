  "body": "Once you\u2019ve flown the nest, and set up home elsewhere, the last thing you expect is to end up back with your parents. But according to a new survey this happens more often than you might imagine. What\u2019s more, people in this situation have been given a name: doomerangers. Unlike the boomerang generation \u2013 who return to the family home not long after flying the nest \u2013 doomerangers left the family home many years before, and return due to financial circumstances, or the sudden loss of their home due to a break-up.  A survey of 505 people in this situation, conducted for Churchill Insurance, found that a quarter of people who moved back had done so after a relationship fell apart. The research revealed men were more likely to become a doomeranger after a divorce or separation. Financial pressure is the main reason, according to 55% of respondents.  We want to hear from so-called doomerangers about moving back in with their parents in later life. Share your experiences with us below.",
