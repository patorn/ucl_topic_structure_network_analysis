  "body": "Andy Murray\u2019s split with his coach, Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, may not have been a complete surprise to some close to the player but it leaves the Scot with an unscheduled distraction going into a summer of unprecedented workload.   Related: Andy Murray broke mould to benefit from Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo\u2019s calm approach    While his long-time friend and assistant trainer, Jamie Delgado, will take over from Mauresmo until Murray finds a replacement he has yet to identify any immediate candidates and is said to be in no hurry to make a decision. However, it is hardly an ideal situation as he prepares for the French Open on clay at the end of the month, followed by Queen\u2019s Club and Wimbledon on grass, a Davis Cup quarter-final back on clay in Belgrade, then the Olympic Games, where he will be defending the title he won in London four years ago, and the US Open on hardcourt \u2013 with only short breaks between them. Murray elaborated on the reasons for the split as he practised in Rome on Monday, suggesting that they were spending too much time apart to make the partnership effective. \u201cI\u2019m sad about it but it just wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Murray told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cWe only spent 10 days together in two and a half months. And in those 10 days I was going through a tough patch in Indian Wells and Miami. It just makes things difficult because you need to work your way through those tough times and when you\u2019re not spending time together it\u2019s very difficult to do that. \u201cIn Miami we only had four days before the tournament. It\u2019s not really enough if you\u2019re trying to work on things and change things. You need a little bit more consistency, so it was just a case of accepting that it wasn\u2019t going to work that way. \u201cThose periods were going to continue happening through the year: post-Wimbledon and post the US Open there were going to be periods where we were spending significant time apart.\u201d There is no denying Murray\u2019s season will be tougher without Mauresmo, who he appointed in June 2014. His failure to retain the Madrid Masters title in a three-set final against Novak Djokovic on Sunday has pushed him back to No3 in the world, which robs him of the guaranteed advantage of starting tournaments at the opposite end of the draw to the Serb. So, after a fitful return to the game since the arrival of his daughter, Sophia, Murray has reason to be frustrated on several fronts. Nevertheless there was no sign of rancour between Murray and Mauresmo \u2013 who have always got on extremely well \u2013 when the announcement was made on Monday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s not a complete surprise,\u201d an insider said. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried to make things work as they are fond of each other.\u201d Both are new parents, too, and, although Mauresmo did not state explicitly that looking after a young child was a reason for withdrawing from the rigours of the Tour, it is likely to have been at least a minor consideration. In January she brought her baby boy to Melbourne, where she and Murray compared notes before his own happy event with Kim, who was expecting their baby \u201cat any minute\u201d in London. Murray took a one-month break before the Davis Cup in April and, in that time, both of them had space in which to consider their needs. Mauresmo is still France\u2019s Fed Cup captain and will probably devote most of her energies towards the team now. Murray would dearly love to beat Serbia \u2013 with or without Djokovic, who seems reluctant to declare his availability \u2013 in the Davis Cup and is prioritising the Olympics in Rio. Those diverging commitments created scheduling gaps for both.

As Murray pointed out, he had tried a similar move at the ATP World Tour finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich last year, to see if it aided his concentration. It did not. Murray was asked if he would consider \u00adworking with another female coach and he said: \u201cYeah. But I haven\u2019t thought about it. Certainly my experience with Am\u00e9lie was a good one. Obviously we would have liked to have won another grand slam in that time, but I got myself from No 11 back up to No 2 in the world and had good results. I had a good experience with Am\u00e9lie.\u201d Mauresmo called working with Murray \u201ca fantastic experience\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed being part of the great team of people he has around him.\u201d Her more nuanced contribution read: \u201cDedicating enough time, along with the travel, has been a challenge for me.\u201d Murray said he had \u201clearned a lot from Am\u00e9lie\u201d since they first worked together at the 2014 Wimbledon. \u201cWe will all miss having her around.\u201d When he signed Mauresmo it followed a lengthy spell alone after the more tumultuous departure of Ivan Lendl. This time, too, he will not rush into a decision. \u201cI\u2019ll take some time to consider the next steps and how we progress from here.\u201d",
