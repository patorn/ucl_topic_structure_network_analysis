  "body": "Guardian US reporter Jamiles Lartey has been named by the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) as the Michael J. Feeney emerging journalist for 2016. The award recognizes emerging journalists who have demonstrated a dedication to covering topics pertaining to the black community and society. Lartey joined the Guardian in 2015 and has since reported on criminal and social justice, most notably contributing to multi award-winning project The Counted. Commenting on the award Lartey said \u201cAll individual awards are really the reflection of a group effort and nothing in my young journalism career could have been accomplished without the mentoring and support of the people I work with at the Guardian US. I\u2019m thrilled and humbled by the opportunity to go forward and try to prove the NABJ right for seeing that potential in me, and to tell important stories - specifically as they pertain to black and African descended people.\u201d",
