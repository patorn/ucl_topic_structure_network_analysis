  "body": "As he talked through his chances in Wednesday\u2019s Chester Cup on Tuesday afternoon, Richard Fahey sounded like a blackjack player who has hit on 12 four times in a row, and seen a picture card every time. \u201cWe\u2019re badly drawn with them all,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cOnly one is in single figures, and there\u2019s two on the wide outside. It hasn\u2019t been kind. It\u2019s not the be all and end all, but I\u2019d prefer to be drawn low.\u201d It is an annual theme before this race, one of the Flat season\u2019s grandest and most historic betting spectacles. The field spends nearly four-and-a-half minutes pounding around the Roodee, as the course is known, twice in the course of the Cup\u2019s two-and-a-quarter miles, one of the longest trips in the calendar, and yet where a horse starts still has a significant impact on where it is likely to finish.   Related: Trip to Paris win earns Graham Lee biggest payday since switch to Flat    Since 2000, and excluding 2012 when a flag start was used and the draw went out of the window, 10 of the 15 winners of the Chester Cup have been drawn from one to six. Trip To Paris, last year\u2019s winner, was an exception as he defied a double-figure stall in 11, but as he confirmed two runs later when winning the Gold Cup at Ascot, he was a cut above the average Chester Cup contender, and thrown in with just 8st 9lb on his back. Even then, he prevailed by just three\u2011quarters of a length from Quick Jack, the favourite 12 months ago and the probable second-favourite on Wednesday for the razor\u2011sharp Tony Martin stable. Quick Jack had stall nine last year but has drawn 16 this time around, and the clear market leader is Roger Varian\u2019s Steve Rogers, a comfortable winner at Kempton last month, from a very favourable berth in stall three. If Fahey\u2019s runners have fared badly in the draw, however, they have at least been steered towards this race from a long way out. All four are owned by Dr Marwan Koukash, whose passion for Chester in general and this race in particular is unbridled, and Gabrial The Hero (3.10) could be the pick of the quartet at attractive odds of around 20-1.

He\u2019s been very lucky in it already, and he beat me once in it as well. It\u2019s a great race, but the draw just puts us on the back foot. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have some plan of attack and Marwan is always keen to go forward with horses so I\u2019m sure a couple of his will be up there. \u201cWhen you\u2019re drawn out there, it\u2019s not what you do, it\u2019s what everyone else does, and you need them to go a gallop if you\u2019re going to come from off the pace. But Gabrial The Hero is the horse [from the four] that\u2019s in very good form.\u201d Aidan O\u2019Brien has declared US Ranger, the favourite for the Derby, for Thursday\u2019s Chester Vase and he also sends a potentially top-class filly to Wednesday\u2019s Cheshire Oaks in Somehow (2.40). She should justify a short price on the way to one or more of her Group-race engagements, while Roudee (3.45) finished well after a slow start at Epsom last time. The selection is a course-and-distance winner in the past and has the ideal draw in stall one if he can be a little faster from the gates this time.",
