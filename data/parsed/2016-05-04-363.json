  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull has defended his record of paying tax and recommended a Melbourne radio host \u201cshell out\u201d for his children to buy a house if he was worried they could not enter the property market.   Related: Clive Palmer: 'I have the courage today to leave the House of Representatives' \u2013 politics live    On ABC radio on Wednesday, Jon Faine asked Turnbull whether his refusal to touch negative gearing was creating generational conflict, with young people resenting the difficulty of entering the housing market. \u201cThey\u2019re saying: \u2018For goodness sake, you baby boomers want everything and you\u2019re locking us out,\u2019\u201d Faine said. Turnbull asked if Faine\u2019s children were locked out of the market, and he said they were. \u201cWell you should shell out for them \u2013 you should support them, a wealthy man like you,\u201d Turnbull said. Faine chuckled and said: \u201cThat\u2019s what they say!\u201d \u201cWell exactly. There you go \u2013 you\u2019ve got the solution in your own hands,\u201d Turnbull replied. \u201cYou can provide a bit of intergenerational equity in the Faine family.\u201d  The comments made light of criticisms that negative gearing and capital gains tax arrangements disproportionately benefit wealthy people. Last week Turnbull said it was \u201cbeside the point\u201d that high-income earners tended to get the largest capital gains from property because \u201cpeople on the highest incomes will make the highest gains, because they tend to have more property\u201d.

Faine said: \u201cIt makes good business sense \u2013 you personally have discovered in the past it makes good business sense to arrange your affairs to reduce your contribution to the tax and treasury in Australia,\u201d he said. Turnbull said: \u201cI have always paid tax in Australia; I pay tax on all of my investment income. I always have done. I\u2019ve always paid a lot of tax; I don\u2019t have a family trust for example.\u201d He said he had always been \u201cvery conservative\u201d in managing his tax affairs and the \u201cinnuendo you\u2019ve made there was unworthy\u201d. \u201cOf course people will try and avoid tax, and of course some people will cheat and break the law. That\u2019s why you need to give the taxation office the resources to enforce the law,\u201d Turnbull said. The prime minister said Labor\u2019s mooted negative gearing changes were not a battle between generations but rather a choice between \u201cjobs and growth and standing in the way of enterprise\u201d. On the fairness of leaving negative gearing untouched, Turnbull said it was \u201cvery much an investment approach that\u2019s taken by middle Australia, by millions of people\u201d. Turnbull reiterated his argument that under Labor\u2019s policy, people earning $80,000 from wages and salary, such as a plumber, would not be able to use negative gearing to reduce their income, but people who earned investment income from dividends and rent could do so.  \u201cWhat Labor is proposing is a reform that denies widely-used investment opportunities \u2013 there have been provisions for \u2018deductability\u2019 in the Tax Act since 1915 \u2013 they\u2019re going to deny that for working Australians but ensure that it remains available for the wealthiest Australians who can offset it against investment income.\u201d",
