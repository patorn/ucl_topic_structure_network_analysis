Last week it was revealed that another literary magazine, Meanjin, might be forced to shut down after its funding was also cut by the council.    Ugh, the laughter at Quadrant likely going under. Go and read some Les Murray for your sins, peasants.\u2014 elle hardy (@ellehardytweets) May 16, 2016     Windschuttle acknowledged that Meanjin had also lost its funding but blamed its problems on a \u201csuccession of editors\u201d and berated the council for funding rival literary magazines the Australian Book Review, the Griffith Review and Overland.  \u201cThey are little more than production lines for the Left\u2019s limitless appetite for identity group politics of gender, race and sexual preference, and its support for any national culture, no matter how violent or barbaric, except our own,\u201d Windschuttle wrote. \u201cIn contrast, since its founding in 1956, Quadrant has consistently defended high culture, freedom of speech, liberal democracy and the Western Judeo-Christian tradition.  \u201cAlthough the Australia Council itself suffered a loss of government funds in 2015, the Quadrant decision was not taken because of a lack of money for literature. Indeed, while abolishing our grant, the council increased its funding to other literary magazines, all of them left-wing.  Windschuttle claimed only Quadrant was serious about publishing literature, and poetry in particular, and had more subscribers than any other literary magazine.   Related: Literary magazine Meanjin may close after losing Australia Council funding    \u201cQuadrant is also the most prolific publisher of poetry in Australia, in either magazine or book format, with up to 300 poems published per year for the past decade. \u201cOur Literary Editor, Les Murray, has worked on every edition since 1990, that is, for 256 of the magazine\u2019s 518 editions. He is not only widely recognized as Australia\u2019s greatest living poet but also Australia\u2019s foremost poetry anthologist.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Australia Council said Meanjin, which was considered a leftwing journal, was also unsuccessful in receiving four-year funding. \u201cAll out arts grants are assessed by a panel of artistic peers and it\u2019s a competitive process. We can\u2019t fund everyone,\u201d she said.  The Australia Council gave $112m to 128 small to medium arts organisations in this funding round, announced on Friday.",
