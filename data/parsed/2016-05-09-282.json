  "body": "Time has mellowed Angry Anderson. \u201cI feel pain in this country,\u201d the former Rose Tattoo frontman told the dozen or so people gathered at a north Sydney golf club on Monday. \u201cI feel anxiety, frustration, anger.\u201d  The self-described \u201cbaddest boy in Australia\u201d was launching his latest Senate foray, this one with the Australian Liberty Alliance, the political wing of a cluster of groups opposed to halal certification and the \u201cIslamisation\u201d of the west.   Related: Geert Wilders tells Australia to abandon multiculturalism or end up like the EU    After a stint with the Nationals, and starring role in the \u201cditch the witch\u201d rallies against the carbon tax, Gary Anderson has turned to one of Australia\u2019s newest parties to push his politics. \u201cDo we want to be governed by a power in Europe?\u201d he began his remarks on Monday. \u201cMy vote is Europeans can govern Europe. Australia, as long as I have breath, will fight to preserve that we are masters of our own identity.\u201d (Few appeared to disagree.) For the ALA, too, Anderson\u2019s candidacy is a winner. Keen to shake off the prefixes \u201cfar-right\u201d and \u201canti-Islam\u201d, the movement is rebranding. It now spruiks \u201csmaller, smarter government\u201d, and a \u201cpro-Australia\u201d outlook. \u201cWe have more than 20 policies,\u201d one of its candidates, Kirralie Smith, told the crowd. But the technocratic planks of its manifesto \u2013 public-private partnerships in healthcare, upping super contributions to 15%, free university lectures for retirees \u2013 still labour in the shadows of its more controversial policies. Anderson said he supported the ALA\u2019s Trump-style ban on immigration from Islamic countries, excluding non-Muslim refugees. \u201cI\u2019ve read history,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want history to repeat itself. I don\u2019t believe we have policies in place to address the issue of Islamisation.\u201d The 68-year-old has featured in a series of SBS\u2019s Go Back to Where You Came From. A critic of Muslim immigration, Anderson was taken to Afghanistan to meet persecuted Hazaras, to see if their plight softened his views. It worked \u2013 sort of. \u201cI went to Kabul \u2026 And I found a group of people who we traced from Melbourne, the Hazara people. And they came here, and to their horror, they were subjected to the same pressures and the same discrimination that they ran away from. \u201cSo they leave that environment, to come to an environment that doesn\u2019t tolerate that, and then we confuse them by allowing the very people they ran away from, to come here, and persecute them here!\u201d It was pointed out that Hazaras are Shia Muslims and, under the ALA\u2019s policy, would be banned from seeking asylum in Australia. \u201cThe complexity of the policy as it stands, I\u2019m not across that,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cBut one of my best mates, he runs a foundation called Save Our Sons, he\u2019s a Syrian Muslim, I take advice from him because he is one, he\u2019s Muslim. \u201cHe says there are clear definitions within the community, which the government\u2019s immigration policy, that we suffer under, has not looked at. We should be listening to those people.\u201d Smith, a campaigner against halal certification, interrupted: \u201cWe will have parameters for persecuted peoples, absolutely. We\u2019re talking about a pause, so we can get measures in place.\u201d    Who said he\u2019s the most popular?  Angry Anderson on Waleed Aly     Did that include banning Hazaras? \u201cThat\u2019s yet to be determined \u2026 As we go, obviously, in whatever effect we can have in government. But we want to start somewhere.\u201d It was perhaps inevitable the launch of a rock star\u2019s political campaign, on a fringe party\u2019s platform, would lead somewhere unexpected. Monday\u2019s launch included an attack on Waleed Aly \u2013 just hours earlier crowned Australian TV\u2019s most popular personality. \u201cWho said he\u2019s the most popular?\u201d Anderson said, when a journalist raised the award. Smith agreed: \u201cHe\u2019s not the most popular, that\u2019s ridiculous anyway. It\u2019s a very closed industry.\u201d The ALA had no problem with the likes of The Project\u2019s host, she said: \u201cIf Waleed Aly was someone who subscribed to the Qur\u2019an \u2026 we would have a great problem with that.   Related: I'm thrilled Waleed Aly won the Gold Logie, but the reasons are complicated | Sunil Badami    \u201cHe actually discredits the Qur\u2019an because he doesn\u2019t follow it, he doesn\u2019t obey it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a problem with the ideology. While he is not representing the Qur\u2019an, following Muhammad, [being] an example of a Qur\u2019an-following Muslim, we have no problem with that.\u201d What Anderson lacks in close study of ALA policies, he might recover by channelling its members\u2019 overriding sentiment: anger. One woman in the audience, Judy, said she had left the Liberals for the ALA. \u201cI\u2019m being told I\u2019m a racist and a bigot,\u201d she said. Smith asked who else had recently left the Liberal party.  Almost every arm in the room was raised.",
