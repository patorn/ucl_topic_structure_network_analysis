  "body": "An expert antiques appraiser who likened a high schooler\u2019s art project to the work of Pablo Picasso and valued it at up to US$50,000 (\u00a335,000) has chalked up the mistake to a learning experience. In a recent episode of the American version of Antiques Roadshow filmed in Spokane, Washington, Alvin Barr from South Carolina presented for appraisal a glazed redware jug, more than 30cm tall and decorated with six faces. Barr had found it at an estate sale in Eugene, Oregon, he said, \u201ccovered with dirt and straw \u2026 some chicken droppings\u201d. Despite its unassuming appearance, he said he \u201chad to have it\u201d, and paid $300 for the item. \u201cIt speaks to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was saying: \u2018I\u2019m very unusual.\u2019\u201d   Related: FA Cup trophy valued at more than \u00a31m on Antiques Roadshow    Appraiser Stephen L Fletcher dated the piece of pottery to \u201cthe late 19th century\u201d, adding: \u201cYou even see a little bit of, like, Pablo Picasso going on here.\u201d He put its retail value at between $30,000 and $50,000. But since the episode with Barr\u2019s acquisition aired in the US on 11 January, Fletcher was found to be spectacularly off the mark. The \u201cgrotesque face jug\u201d, as it was referred to on the show, was not centuries old but made in a high school ceramics class in 1973. A woman watching the show recognised the pot as the work of her friend, Betsy Soule of Oregon, and contacted the program. Soule, a horse trainer from Bend, Oregon, told her local paper she had made the jug in a ceramics class at Eugene\u2019s Churchill high school in 1973 or 1974. She said she had sculpted what came to her imagination. \u201cI was just a really passionate, artistic kid,\u201d she told the Bend Bulletin. \u201cI don\u2019t know where those faces came from; they just came roaring out of me on to those pots.\u201d PBS has since corrected the details of the appraisal on its website, and revised its value to between US $3,000 and $5,000. Fletcher chalked up the misunderstanding as a learning experience, noting that Soule\u2019s pot was \u201cunlike any other example I have seen\u201d. \u201cThis example, with its six grotesque faces, was modeled or sculpted with considerable imagination, virtuosity and technical competence.  \u201cObviously, I was mistaken as to its age by 60 to 80 years. I feel the value at auction, based on its quality and artistic merit, is in the $3,000-$5,000 range. Still not bad for a high schooler in Oregon.\u201d",
