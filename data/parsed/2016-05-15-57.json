Related: Comparing Woody Allen to Polanski and Cosby is lazy and dangerous | Catherine Shoard    The subject of the Kering Women in Motion Talk, atop the Majestic Hotel, was the 25th anniversary of Thelma and Louise, with Sarandon accompanied by her co-star in that film, Geena Davis.  But Sarandon, spurred by questions from the press, also addressed myriad other topics with typical abandon. (Most recently, Sarandon, a registered Democrat and avid Bernie Sanders supporter, courted controversy for saying she might abstain from voting for Clinton, should the former secretary of state win the nomination to contest the presidency with Trump.) A reporter asked the actor what she made of Allen\u2019s comment at a press conference for his Cannes opener, Caf\u00e9 Society, that he didn\u2019t have \u201canything to really draw on\u201d to one day make a film about a younger man and an older woman (his narratives often center on an older man and a much younger woman).  Sarandon at first appeared to shut it down: \u201cI have nothing good to say about Woody Allen, so I don\u2019t think we should go there.\u201d Pressed to elaborate, Sarandon said: \u201cI think he sexually assaulted a child and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right \u2026 It\u2019s gotten very quiet in here, but that\u2019s true.\u201d Sarandon was referring to allegations made by Allen\u2019s daughter and brought back into the public eye this week by his son, Ronan Farrow. The allegations, which Allen denies, were investigated in 1993 but no charges were brought.  Later, Sarandon was asked what a Trump presidency would look like. Sarandon said she did not imagine the billionaire businessman and Republic candidate winning, because \u201che\u2019s alienated so many minorities and women\u201d.  But should he beat Clinton, Sarandon said Trump would not be able to enact many of his grand policies.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what [Trump] thinks because nothing will be able to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing interesting about Trump is the things he\u2019s talking about are impossible. They\u2019re not what\u2019s threatening. He\u2019s obviously not going to build a wall; he\u2019s not going to be able to export all the Muslims in the United States. All of those things are impossible to do. \u201cWhat he did that was terrible is that he legitimatized racism and homophobia in order get that very discontented base that wants something authentic. What he did in the process was say, \u2018It\u2019s OK to be violent.\u2019 That\u2019s why he has the KKK as one of his representatives. That\u2019s been really terrible, besides the fact that America looks ridiculous.\u201d In fact, earlier this year, Trump hesitated to disavow an endorsement from a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. This week, it was revealed that the Trump campaign\u2019s California delegates to the national convention included an avowed white nationalist. Sarandon praised Sanders for \u201cactivating minorities \u2026 people who have not been engaged in the political process before, especially millions of millennials\u201d. She said she believed Sanders supporters would not let Trump go through with his agenda, and would fuel a widespread backlash, should he be elected president.  Lastly, Sarandon targeted the American mainstream media for being \u201cirresponsible\u201d.

That\u2019s why the millennials knew so much, because they were online. The mainstream media never paid attention to him.\u201d When Variety\u2019s Ramin Setoodeh, who was moderating the event, pointed out that the media\u2019s current narrative said Clinton would beat Sanders to win the Democratic nomination, Sarandon scoffed: \u201cIt\u2019s been the narrative all along. I don\u2019t agree with that narrative.\u201d Referring to the continuing investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server while secretary of state, she said: \u201cI think a lot can happen besides the fact that [Clinton] can be indicted at any moment. She stands a very good chance.\u201d",
