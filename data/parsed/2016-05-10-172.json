  "body": "\u201cNothing happens. Twice.\u201d That was the succinct view of the Irish critic and Beckett expert Vivian Mercier on Waiting for Godot. Beckett, of course, was the master of writing theatre that defied Aristotle\u2019s theory that plot is a significant requirement for drama. You don\u2019t go to Endgame or Not I for the cliffhangers. There are several plays currently on stage in London, or about to tour, that defy the idea that narrative is a primary driver of interest in the theatre as some have suggested. I\u2019m not sure it ever is. After all, we keep going to see King Lear even when we know what will happen; we don\u2019t shun A Doll\u2019s House because we are already acquainted with the fact that Nora will leave at the end.     Character investment \u2026 Boy at the Almeida. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    It\u2019s not that productions such as Boy at the Almeida or The Flick at the National or Alexander Zeldin\u2019s devastating Beyond Caring don\u2019t tell stories \u2013 they all do \u2013 but they do it in a way that eschews the traditional arc of plot development. You want to know what happens but that\u2019s because you are totally invested in the characters and believe in them so completely and feel for them, not because you expect there to be a sudden shooting or stabbing or great revelation. These productions work through texture and subtext and mood rather than plot devices. The lack of narrative drive is a bonus rather than a negative; in fact I must confess I was slightly disgruntled when, in its final few scenes, The Flick fell back on a more traditional plotting device. There\u2019s nothing new about all this. Ionesco\u2019s The Bald Soprano works as if on a continuous loop like an old-fashioned tape, and Pinter\u2019s Landscape is a play in which not much happens but much emerges. Uncle Vanya may reach its climax with a gunshot but until that moment it is simply a group of mostly quite unhappy people chatting. However, at a time when life feels ever busier and faster, there does seem to be an increased interest in pieces such as Boy (lasting a mere 90 minutes) and The Flick (three and a half hours, but you don\u2019t realise it) that are not narrative driven, something that live art has explored for years, particularly in durational work. Nobody goes to see most Forced Entertainment shows for the plot. Perhaps it\u2019s because TV has become so intensely plot driven: I\u2019m not watching Game of Thrones because of the complexity of its characterisations but to see who will die next.     Mostly quite unhappy people chatting \u2026 Uncle Vanya. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    Interestingly, many of these plotless or plot-light theatre shows are set in the world of work, which seems to particularly lend itself to the rhythm of plays in which not much happens. Perhaps because watching people work on stage \u2013 whether sweeping up in both The Flick and Beyond Caring, or putting up a marquee in David Storey\u2019s The Contractor \u2013 is fascinating. The actors are not pretending to sweep a floor or erect a tent, they are actually doing it.    Related: Lyn Gardner: In praise of painfully good theatre    Perhaps it\u2019s this act of doing, carried out in real time, that negates the need for narrative-heavy plots where one damned thing after another keeps on happening. It\u2019s still storytelling, it\u2019s just the stories that are being told emerge more organically. While Beyond Caring, The Flick and Boy may require more patience on the part of the audience and a willingness to go with the flow and submit to the quiet understated rhythm of the drama, the investment is often amply rewarded.",
