  "body": "If you search out North Carolina\u2019s conservative heart, you might find it here: in Fayetteville at the Maxway, a discount shop. Fayetteville is home to the sprawling Fort Bragg army base and consistently votes Republican. Maxway is owned by Art Pope, a conservative philanthropist who is arguably the most influential figure in state politics. So, has the ongoing agony over bathrooms thrown the customers and employees of Maxway into confusion? \u201cOh, goodness. Well, we do have two bathrooms,\u201d said Camelia Taylor, the store manager. \u201cBut one is marked for either men or women. The other is for employees, but we pretty much let anyone use it.\u201d That\u2019s a typical response among North Carolinians. Life among the sinks and stalls of the state has carried on unchanged, in actual practice. Transgender people aren\u2019t attacking children. Citizens aren\u2019t rising up with torches and pitchforks. Theory is another matter, though. Politicians in the Old North State are describing to their constituents a theory of bathroom chaos that seems entirely uncoupled from both the practice and the attitudes of most people. Along the way, North Carolina\u2019s reputation as the south\u2019s progressive, intellectual capital has started to circle the drain. It has become a symbol of intolerance, it faces a court battle with the federal government, and it has exemplified that most un-southern quality: tawdriness. So North Carolina seems to be suffering the sudden onset of a provincial schizophrenia. Why? The answer is not hidden but has gone largely unspoken. The conflict is to a great extent the doing of two powerful and opposing politicians, stuck in a machiavellian duel. It reveals a great deal about North Carolina. And just as much, possibly, about what lies ahead for the entire United States.      Signage is seen outside a restroom at a hotel in Durham. Photograph: Gerry Broome/AP    The path to the Great Bathroom Emergency of 2016 started eight years ago, when Barack Obama won North Carolina\u2019s presidential vote by a .4% margin.  It was a slim victory, but thunderous.  \u201cIn the previous election North Carolina had voted for George W Bush by 12 points,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a professor at Catawba College and one of the state\u2019s foremost political scientists.  Obama\u2019s campaign tactics \u2013 grassroots fundraising, micro-targeted marketing \u2013 caught Republicans flat-footed. \u201cThis was still the party of Jesse Helms,\u201d Bitzer said. Helms was a five-term senator who waged a notorious fight against the civil rights movement. \u201cPeople were completely astonished here.\u201d In the resultant Tea party insurgency of 2010, the far right seized control of North Carolina\u2019s senate and house for the first time since the Reconstruction. So after the 2010 census Republicans controlled the once-a-decade redrawing of political districts and packed liberal voters into a small number of densely populated districts. They sacrificed the urban areas and consolidated power in rural districts.  North Carolina was, and still is, a \u201cpurple\u201d state. But overnight it transformed from a state of purple counties to a state with blue urban islands in a sea of red.  \u201cAny areas of real competitiveness are shrinking,\u201d Bitzer said. The field has become so polarized that elections are forgone things; if a candidate has no chance of winning a county, why even bother visiting? That\u2019s now the case in 85% of the state\u2019s districts, according to Bitzer\u2019s analysis. The two sides have stopped talking to each other. It\u2019s a trajectory that mirrors the United States as a whole. Rural and urban, left and right, entrenched parties and ideological isolation. All of which means that North Carolina\u2019s upcoming gubernatorial race may be the tightest in the nation. The main contenders are the Republican incumbent, Pat McCrory, and his Democratic attorney general, Roy Cooper. Both men rose to power as moderates but found themselves scrambling for a way to appeal to their base constituencies: rural conservatives for McCrory and urban liberals for Cooper. Then came the flush heard \u2019round the world.     Protesters gather outside the North Carolina museum of history as the governor makes remarks about HB2 during a government affairs conference in Raleigh. Photograph: Gerry Broome/AP    It wasn\u2019t supposed to go this far. \u201cNobody was licking his chops for this,\u201d as one Republican leader put it.  In press conferences McCrory has appeared mystified by the world\u2019s reaction, and has said as much. \u201cThe majority of the citizens in our great state, and this governor, did not seek out this issue,\u201d he recently told a bank of television cameras.  The conflict first arose in Charlotte, the state\u2019s financial center, where in March the city council passed an ordinance that transgender people may use the bathroom according to the gender with which they identify. In an emergency session the state legislators overturned the ordinance. They hastily passed House Bill 2, which bans cities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances that protect gay and transgender people in any way, bathrooms or otherwise. The move brought a crush of global attention. Giant companies \u2013 Google, Apple, Disney \u2013 struck out at the law and pledged to pull back their businesses if the law wasn\u2019t repealed.  Then this week the federal government weighed in, when US attorney general Loretta Lynch called HB2 \u201cstate-sponsored discrimination\u201d and filed suit. North Carolina responded by filing its own suit.            Loretta Lynch: North Carolina has created \u2018state-sponsored discrimination\u2019    When the backlash began, Cooper \u2013 the attorney general and aspiring gubernatorial candidate \u2013 announced his refusal to defend the law and called it a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d.  McCrory responded by releasing a statement that alluded to Cooper through the thinnest of veils: \u201cSome have called our state an embarrassment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real embarrassment is politicians not publicly respecting each other\u2019s positions on complex issues.\u201d McCrory\u2019s and Cooper\u2019s moves and machinations revolve around a figure as unpredictable as any in the history of US politics: Donald Trump.  Bitzer, the political scientist, said his polls show an inverse relationship between the number of college graduates in a place and its support for Trump. In a state that prides itself on its university system, there is broad distaste for Trump.  But the base refuses to be ignored. Trump\u2019s campaign reached a low \u2013 or a peak, depending \u2013 in March at a rally in Fayetteville, when a white Trump supporter sucker-punched a black protester.            Trump supporter sucker-punches black protester at rally    Trump\u2019s centrifugal power forces everyone to the edges, where McCrory and Cooper now find themselves pondering questions like: will moderate conservatives stay home on election day? If so, it may benefit McCrory to see the bathroom brouhaha carry on until that time, to spur people toward the voting booths.  Or will an extended fight only heap more shame and risk on the state? In that case, it may benefit Cooper to see it continue.  Trump\u2019s presence is palpable in North Carolina, but his exact effect on state politics is almost incalculable. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond me,\u201d Bitzer said. \u201cI\u2019m only a PhD.\u201d     T-shirts protesting HB2 in Asheville. Photograph: Katie Bailey for the Guardian    The stakes are genuine and high with HB2. It\u2019s a matter of civil rights, gender and acceptance that will affect people\u2019s lives in intimate, vulnerable ways.  But beneath the swirl of politics, regular North Carolinians such as Taylor at the Maxway store continue to select their toilets with no more thought than they did a year ago.  In Asheville, a transgender business owner who goes by SB said most people are \u201cso loving and supportive\u201d. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not shocked and saddened by our governor and legislature,\u201d SB said. \u201cBut the people \u2013 people I see daily \u2013 have been so positive.\u201d    That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not shocked and saddened by our governor and legislature. But people I see daily [are] so positive  SB     In Raleigh, the prestigious public Broughton high school has become central in the debate about the bathroom law as it applies in schools. A collection of transgender advocacy groups held a press conference recently on the sidewalk outside the school, whose grand stone bell tower loomed overhead.  JoDee Winterhof, senior vice-president of the Human Rights Campaign, addressed a group of reporters. \u201cRather than wasting even more time and millions more taxpayer dollars defending a reckless and discriminatory bill,\u201d she said, \u201cGovernor McCrory should be working with state lawmakers to fix the mess he\u2019s created.\u201d The conference \u2013 and the whole matter of HB2 \u2013 incensed a Broughton alum named Dallas Woodhouse. He\u2019s now the head of the Republican party in North Carolina. \u201cThe school has had the same bathroom policy for going on a hundred years,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecial accommodations can be made for transgender people, just like people in wheelchairs. I would have loved as a 16-year-old boy to go into the girls\u2019 locker room. But it\u2019s not good for society.\u201d Inside the school\u2019s stone walls, assistant principal Mike Lentz sat at a cluttered desk in his office and called the county\u2019s communications department to find out how, exactly, to address the matter of toilets.

Related: Obama orders public schools to allow transgender students access to restrooms    On Thursday the Obama administration released a letter calling for schools across the country to allow transgender students to access the bathrooms where they feel most comfortable. The letter didn\u2019t mention North Carolina but was a clear rebuke. At Broughton, Lentz walked along a school hallway. \u201cThis thing will work itself out between the state and federal governments,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now we are just trying to stay focused on teaching kids.
