  "body": "Marwan Koukash, the Salford owner, has called on his fellow Super League chairmen to support him in a bid to break away from the Rugby Football League. Koukash held a press conference on Wednesday to address the club\u2019s six-point deduction for breaching the salary cap, but also spoke at length about his plans to force a vote of no confidence in the game\u2019s governing body, whom he branded \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d earlier this week. Koukash wants the owners of all 12 clubs to unite to force a split between the sport\u2019s elite competition and those who govern the game \u2013 similar to the proposal that led to the founding of football\u2019s Premier League in 1991, as a breakaway from the Football League. \u201cThe future lies in the hands of the 12 chairmen of Super League,\u201d said Koukash, who hopes to arrange a meeting of the owners within the next fortnight. \u201cSuper League should have full control of its finances, its compliance unit, refereeing and the lot. I\u2019m talking about a split, 100% \u2013 and I think it will happen, I believe I just need a majority vote. \u201cI have no intention of being the leader of such a move, but before the end of the week I will have contacted all my fellow chairmen and I\u2019m going to arrange to get together within the next two weeks. Again I have to stress this: the future of the game rests in our hands. I need their backing.\u201d Koukash warned that if the game continues under the governance of those currently in charge, it risks regressing to such an extent that it could not remain full-time. He said: \u201cIf we\u2019re not careful we could end up becoming a feeder competition to the NRL and it may threaten the status of the sport, we could become semi-professional. \u201cI look at the people leading us like Nigel Wood and Ralph Rimmer, and I look at what has gone on here and the lack of commercial income that they are generating \u2013 do I think they\u2019re capable of taking us to the next level? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Koukash also hit out at the RFL regarding a number of other issues, including a claim that he was offered money to alter a fixture involving Salford. He said: \u201cWe had a request from a bigger club who wanted to move their fixture by one day but we said no. The RFL stepped in, offered my club a substantial amount of money, which I accepted and we moved the fixture as agreed \u2013 it helped the big club.\u201d However, that allegation was rejected by the RFL, who said that a \u00a315,000 payment was agreed to by the Super League board, not the governing body. An RFL spokesperson said: \u201cThe Super League board agreed to make a payment of \u00a315,000 to Salford Red Devils to assist in the resolution of a fixture scheduling issue for the 2016 season. No payment was ever made by the RFL.\u201d",
