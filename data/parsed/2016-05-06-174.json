The airstrikes on Thursday afternoon near Sarmada, a town in Idlib province just 12 miles away from Reyhanli in Turkey, left the camp in ruins, with one witness describing a scene of horror, with tents on fire and body parts strewn around the area.   Related: The Guardian view on Syria: the agonies of Aleppo | Editorial    Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, demanded an immediate investigation. \u201cIf this obscene attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of a civilian structure, it could amount to a war crime,\u201d he said. Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, said it was \u201cextremely unlikely that these murderous attacks were an accident\u201d given the tents could be clearly viewed from the air.  \u201cMy staff, along with other organisations, will leave no stone unturned in their efforts to research and record evidence of what appears to be a particularly despicable and calculated crime against an extremely vulnerable group of people,\u201d he said.  The French foreign ministry said in a statement that the bombings \u201ccould be constitutive of a war crime and a crime against humanity.\u201d The White House earlier called the strike indefensible. There was no justifiable excuse to target civilians who had already fled their homes from violence, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, calling the situation heartbreaking. The US said it has not confirmed who carried out the strike, but said no US or coalition aircraft were operating in the area. Syria\u2019s military have denied any involvement. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s Syrian or Russian aircraft, but they struck in the middle of the camp and many of the tents have been burned,\u201d said Alaa Fatraoui, a journalist who saw the aftermath.  He added: \u201cThere are many martyrs and body parts. I saw with my own eyes nearly 30 dead. It\u2019s a very bloody scene. It\u2019s revenge against civilians. There are absolutely no armed men there, they\u2019re all civilian refugees, homeless people living on the street.\u201d   Map of camp   The opposition\u2019s Syrian National Coalition described the attack as an \u201cappalling massacre by regime forces against civilians\u201d and said it showed Assad was not a serious partner for peace. \u201cThe Syrian Coalition condemns the international community\u2019s silence, which represents direct complicity in Assad\u2019s war against civilians in Syria as it has been interpreted by the regime as a green light to kill more and more Syrians,\u201d the coalition said in a statement, adding that more than 30 people were killed in the attack and dozens were injured. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group with contacts inside Syria, said dozens had been left dead or wounded, seven of whom were children. Images provided by activists in the area showed civil defence workers putting out fires with debris and burned-out tent husks on the ground. M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which operates a camp for 80,000 internally displaced Syrians in nearby Atmeh and had provided vaccinations to the refugees in al-Kammouneh, said the attack showed that civilians were paying the price for the ongoing conflict. The charity said it did not know exactly what happened in the attack on the camp, or who was responsible, but that the camp was inhabited by internal refugees who had already been displaced multiple times during the war. \u201cIt is extremely concerning \u2026 and a clear sign again that civilians are paying the price in this conflict,\u201d said Sam Taylor, MSF\u2019s communications coordinator for Syria.  The al-Kammouneh camp is believed to have as many as 500 tents, with an average of six or seven family members per household. The majority are civilians who fled the nearby Aleppo province, where an offensive by the Syrian government is threatening to cause a humanitarian catastrophe. The footage of charred bodies and men using buckets of water to try to douse flames was in stark contrast to the concert at the Unesco world heritage site of Palmyra, where renowned conductor Valery Gergiev led a performance by the Mariinsky Symphony Orchestra from St Petersburg. A cessation of hostilities brokered by Russia and the US brought a measure of relief to Aleppo on Thursday. But fighting continued nearby and Assad said he still sought total victory over rebels in Syria. Assad said in a telegram to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that his army would not accept anything less than \u201cattaining final victory\u201d and \u201ccrushing the aggression\u201d by rebels in Aleppo, according to state media.           Firefighters battle flames at refugee camp following airstrike    \u201cWe call on Russia to urgently address this totally unacceptable statement,\u201d US state department spokesman Mark Toner told a briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly an effort by Assad to push his agenda, but it is incumbent on Russia to assert influence on that regime to maintain the cessation of hostilities.\u201d Toner sought to address confusion over the timeline for the cessation of hostilities, with Syrian state media saying the army would abide by a \u201cregime of calm\u201d in Aleppo for 48 hours from 2200 GMT on Wednesday and the state department emphasising it was open-ended. Russia blocked a British-drafted UN security council statement, which would have condemned the surge in violence in Aleppo and attacks against civilians. \u201cThere is one country that could not agree [to] it and it\u2019s Russia,\u201d Britain\u2019s UN ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters. \u201cThat does speak volumes about their support for protection of the Assad regime.\u201d The Sarmada attack highlighted the growing savagery of the conflict in the aftermath of the collapse of a ceasefire deal brokered by the US and Russia that was meant to pave the way for peace negotiations. The talks in Geneva were deadlocked amid the government delegation\u2019s refusal to discuss a transition that would see Assad eased out of power. The ceasefire\u2019s fate was effectively sealed by the launch of the regime\u2019s offensive last weekend in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city and its former commercial capital. It comes days after the government destroyed a hospital backed by the Red Cross and MSF, killing the last paediatrician left in rebel-held eastern Aleppo, and a rebel attack on a maternity hospital in the government-controlled west of the city. The attack raises questions over the safety of refugees who were uprooted in the war and settled in refugee camps near the Turkish border. Ankara has repeatedly called for safe zones in the area to protect the refugees from airstrikes, but the proposals have been met with a shrug by western powers involved in the conflict. Refugees fleeing recent fighting have been kept on the Syrian side of the border rather than being admitted into Turkey.",
