  "body": "Telegraph Media Group\u2019s chief executive Murdoch MacLennan is showing how to manage modern newspapers with compassion.  Day one, memo to staff: We\u2019re introducing \u201csmart working\u201d, and hot-desking and \u201cemployee-friendly\u201d flexible working practices. Day two, memo to staff: We\u2019re introducing flexible non-working practices for a selected number of staff that will require no desks at all. It\u2019s MacLennan\u2019s unsophisticated version of the first-the-good-news, now-the-bad-news joke. Not so funny, however, for the people who must walk the plank. What was that day one quote again about the employee-friendly approach? \u201cThis will allow many of us to have a better work-life balance.\u201d [my italics] For some of us, the work bit will no longer be relevant. They have been culled from the Daily Telegraph and its Sunday sister in order to cut space at TMG\u2019s Victoria office and thereby \u201csave significantly on rents and rates\u201d. They will not be among the \u201ctop talent\u201d who are being promised pay increases during a review of remuneration enhancements, benefits and reward packages.  Alongside this fluff were pledges about fostering digital innovation. Yeah? Really? Pull the other one. Forget the spin, and tell it like it is. TMG is making money but its owners, the Barclay brothers, want more... and more... and more. As I reported in February, TMG claimed its unaudited accounts would show that it made an operating profit of \u00a351m in 2015. That was \u00a34m down on the previous year, but it was still a remarkable return. How, I wondered at the time, did TMG manage to do better than several rival publishers? Answer from the source who leaked the accounts: a firm control on costs. Not firm enough, it would seem. Clearly, in order to keep those profits up this year, firmer control is thought necessary. Sadly, staff cuts are part of the continuing story of the newspaper industry. The Guardian Media Group announced in March that it is planning to cut 250 jobs, including 100 in editorial. And unlike TMG, it is doing so against the background of a \u00a358.6m loss. TMG\u2019s attempt to gloss another round of newsroom cutbacks - an annual event - with nonsense about an \u201cemployee-friendly\u201d initiative should be seen for what it is: a diversion to mask an unpalatable reality.",
