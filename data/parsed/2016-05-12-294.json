  "body": "After being widely criticised, the Los Angeles band Yacht have apologised for the \u201cegregious mistake\u201d of claiming to have had a sex tape leaked to the internet. On Monday, Yacht\u2019s Jona Bechtolt and Claire Evans \u2013 who are in a relationship \u2013 posted on Facebook claiming a film they had made for private use had been leaked by a \u201cmorally abject person\u201d, against whom they were taking legal action. \u201cWe hope you understand that this is not a delicious scandal. This is an exploitation,\u201d they wrote. Shortly afterwards, they announced that to gain control of the situation, they would sell the sex tape themselves. They were besieged with messages of support from fans outraged on their behalf.   Related: Yacht's sex tape hoax undermines real 'revenge porn' victims, say activists    On Wednesday, however, it was revealed as a hoax, to promote their new music video, for I Wanna Fuck You Til I\u2019m Dead. The hoax was revealed by Jezebel \u2013 owned by Gawker \u2013 which revealed that the main Gawker site had been contacted about participating in the stunt: \u201cIn the days leading up to the video\u2019s release, we\u2019re going to pretend we were hacked, share and delete confessional social media posts on the subject of our privacy, then try to \u2018get out in front of it\u2019 and sell the sex tape, fake a server crash, etc.\u201d The condemnation was widespread and immediate, with even the band\u2019s publicists disassociating themselves from the stunt. They were accused of lacking empathy for the real victims of revenge porn, who find sexual images of themselves on the internet without their prior knowledge or permission. Yacht responded with a defensive statement in which they claimed: \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s disturbing to us that press outlets could make the incredibly irresponsible leap from \u2018celebrity sex tape\u2019, which is the cultural trope this project explicitly references, to \u2018revenge porn\u2019, which is unfunny, disgusting, morally repugnant, and completely unrelated. Even within the fictional narrative we created, there was no violence or exploitation. It was always about agency and proactive empowerment.\u201d Finally, on Wednesday, Yacht apologised on their Facebook page, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for our shitty non-apology yesterday, too. There\u2019s no justifying it. We clearly didn\u2019t get it then. We get it now.\u201d The apology read:  First off, we\u2019re sorry.  The reaction to this endeavor highlights a glaring error we made in positioning ourselves as the victims of a leaked sex tape. We understand that positioning it that way from the beginning was an egregious mistake, and are so ashamed we hadn\u2019t considered this beforehand.  Yes, this was all a \u2018hoax\u2019 or \u2018PR stunt\u2019, and one we were so excited to share. While there is inherent deception in pulling a hoax, it was never our intention to mock or make light of anyone who has been a victim of a privacy violation like the one we mentioned. This was a lazy starting point for what we wanted to be a much more fun story about the expectations of a sex tape and the frenzy surrounding the taboo of sex, especially juxtaposed with our own non-celebrity. We failed to tell that story. Instead we told a much darker and more disturbing story.  We\u2019ve been going back and forth on what to do about the music video this was all supposed to lead up to. We were leaning towards not releasing it at all, but we think it\u2019s important that people be able to see and assess for themselves our intent. We take full responsibility for what has happened, and we are truly sorry. We know we\u2019ve broken a bond of trust with many of our fans and friends. Thank you to those that called us out and helped us to understand the gravity of the mistake we made. We should not have hinged this entire project on the fiction that we were the victims of a leaked tape, and we\u2019re equally disappointed in ourselves for taking so long to get over being shocked at the response and write this apology.  After all is said and done, of course you should be mad at us. We\u2019re mad at us too.  Love,  Jona & Claire PS: We\u2019re sorry for our shitty non-apology yesterday, too.
