  "body": "When universities were first created in medieval times, they were mainly communities of ecclesiastical scholars. Now, they are multimillion-pound businesses with complex leadership teams, human resources departments, mission statements, international strategies, communications executives and directors of enterprise.   Related: Facing the future: how can university boards stay ahead of the game?    They also face increasingly complex challenges \u2013 changes to funding and regulatory systems (like the draft Teaching Excellence Framework) weigh heavily on growing challenges from global competition, a diverse student body and new technology.  \u201cThere\u2019s greater unpredictability, greater demands in terms of accountability and greater expectations with regard to who you manage,\u201d says Professor Peter McCaffery, deputy vice-chancellor of London Metropolitan University and a higher education leadership analyst. \u201cIt is more genuinely competitive than ever before.\u201d Leaders in higher education now have to be comfortable with continuous change, he says \u2013 resilient, flexible and able to focus on their institution\u2019s mission despite numerous other distractions. Risk and reward Fiona Ross, director of research at the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, says that governing bodies are taking on more responsibilities. As well as setting the strategy of the institution and keeping an eye on its financial health, it has to take more interest in academic risk, assuring the quality of the degrees and experience the institution offers. This has become particularly important as universities start delivering education overseas.  Pressures have also grown on vice-chancellors, the chief executives. As universities\u2019 principal source of funding has changed from government grants to tuition fees, funding has become less dependable. Many university leaders now need to spend a large chunk of their time on fundraising and looking for other ways of raising cash. As a result, many now have a business background. But Julie Lydon, vice-chancellor of the University of South Wales, who started her career in industry and lectured in business, says the culture of universities remains distinct.  \u201cLeaders of a \u00a3200m business expect people to get on with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn higher education that\u2019s the starting point for a debate.\u201d She says effective communication is an essential skill for vice-chancellors, not only in getting their own staff on board with strategic decisions but in influencing government, or negotiating partnerships with outside organisations.   Related: Employers and universities already work together - we shouldn't put that at risk     Workable workloads Sue Chambers, vice-chair of Universities Human Resources \u2013 a support group for HR professionals in higher education \u2013 says university leaders have a crucial role to play in creating a thriving environment. At the University of Aberystwyth, where she works, the leadership team supports work-life balance. \u201cWe aren\u2019t alone in trying to find a fair and transparent way of managing workload in which output is valued over time spent at work.\u201d For McCaffery, being an external ambassador and managing risk internally are key attributes of a successful university leader, as well as strategic planning, vision and academic credibility. \u201cThere is a view that you don\u2019t need to be an academic to run a university and we are getting more of that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you must have academic credibility. Otherwise you won\u2019t last.\u201d Ross says the whole point of a university leadership structure is to enable staff to deliver the fundamental purposes of a university: sharing learning, producing knowledge and contributing to the community.  \u201cPeople get obsessed about structure, but unless it is stopping you from delivering these things, you don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d she says. She also defends the recent tendency in higher education towards tighter management control. \u201cSome criticise the \u2018creeping managerialism\u2019 because they see it as a challenge to autonomy and academic freedom,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my view, with increasingly complex institutions, dealing with so many different things compared with 20 or 30 years ago, there has to be some semblance of management.\u201d     \u2018The most challenging aspects of the role as leader are people-facing, human-resources issues,\u2019 says Nick Petford, vice-chancellor at the University of Northampton    The right direction For Nick Petford, vice-chancellor at the University of Northampton for the past five years, leading a university is all about being true to its mission. \u201cYou have to find out what the university is about, where it comes from,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise you might try to turn it in a direction it doesn\u2019t want to go.\u201d But it is also about the bottom line, and maintaining an effective and efficient business model. This is a particular issue for Northampton because it is building a new campus, due to open in 2018, funded through a bond. With radical changes afoot \u2013 academics will no longer have their own offices \u2013 getting staff on board has been crucial. \u201cThe most challenging aspects of the role as leader are people-facing, human resources issues,\u201d he says.  Petford now operates mainly through his mobile phone, sitting wherever he finds a spare desk, and rejecting a more traditional hierarchical arrangement. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t presenting the right image for a university moving forward in the 21st century.\u201d He stresses the importance of higher education leaders keeping up to date with how technology is transforming life outside the university, as they are training the next generation for a changing jobs market. Northampton\u2019s focus on social innovation has led to a number of projects with local authorities and boosted its finances. \u201cCash-generating initiatives buy you a level of autonomy, which means you don\u2019t have to follow like sheep some of the more ridiculous pronouncements that come from politicians,\u201d says Petford. Universities need this independence to stand out from the crowd, he says. \u201cIf you get that right you can find space for yourself.\u201d Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.
