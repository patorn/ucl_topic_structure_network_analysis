Views, released on Friday, is an ode to Drake\u2019s hometown: references abound to local streets and landmarks, city transit gets a shout-out, and the album cover, already widely parodied, finds the rapper perched nonchalantly atop the CN Tower. But Kelly\u2019s affection ran deeper than mere civic pride. The 74-year-old city councillor and former de facto mayor greeted the record like a father in a delivery room. His love wasn\u2019t just fervent. It was paternal. Views arrived at midnight and Norm Kelly ushered it in. On Twitter, where he boasts nearly three hundred thousand followers, Kelly was aglow with praise. \u201cThe city is urging those who plan on purchasing #VIEWS to make sure your fire alarm is operational,\u201d he joked in the hours before release. And when it finally dropped, he was succinct about the thrill. He tweeted just two words: \u201cOh boy.\u201d Toronto picked the exclamation up as if he\u2019d just spoken for the whole city. He was retweeted more than five thousand times.        Kelly is a social media phenomenon. It\u2019s not often that city councillors are Twitter stars, but Kelly definitely is one. Indeed, among millennials, he\u2019s thought of as part idol and part meme: they\u2019ve christened him \u201c6 Dad\u201d, derived from Drake\u2019s name for Toronto, \u201cthe 6\u201d, which has since become a globally recognized alias for Canada\u2019s largest city.  Kelly has been active on Twitter since 2010, but it was only last summer that he attracted so considerable a following. In July, while Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill was engaged in a much-publicized quarrel with Drake, Kelly tweeted a message in supported of the hometown superstar: \u201cYou\u2019re no longer welcome in Toronto, @MeekMill.\u201d It would go on to be retweeted 129,675 times \u2013 and with that, the otherwise inauspicious @norm went viral. Further barbs, nastier (and funnier) still, continued to hit the Twitter stratosphere.     Drake, Toronto\u2019s hometown hero. Photograph: PR Company Handout    So merciless were Kelly\u2019s attacks that Meek Mill was soon compelled to respond: \u201cAye white man @norm what gives you the audacity to tell me I can\u2019t come somewhere over voicing my opinion!\u201d the rapper tweeted. It was highly unusual that a popular rapper should have bothered to retaliate against a politician in his mid-70s. Naturally, Kelly \u2013 and, of course, his new squad of Drake-loving young fans \u2013 took this retort as a compliment. \u201cI innocently strayed on to the rap battlefield,\u201d Kelly said with modesty, seated behind the desk of his City Hall office. \u201cI sent that tweet out there about Meek. That just sparked an enormous amount of interest. With Meek, things turned serious.\u201d Kelly still ribs his rival on occasion, to great effect: a joke he made at the rapper\u2019s expense in January has been retweeted more than 150,000 times. His account generally thrives without confrontation. Interest varies, as you might imagine. A  declaration about ginger ale may luck into 6,000 retweets; an advisory about March break activities in Toronto may earn only a few dozen. The breakout successes repeat a familiar theme: rap feuds. In March, Kelly marshalled a Drake reference to trash-talk Donald Trump. Within hours, it had been retweeted 25,000 times.

Kelly is now a full-blown local celebrity: when he goes out, he\u2019s swarmed, cheered, hollered at or excitedly high-fived. Hardly a day passes that an eager Torontonian doesn\u2019t descend upon him, unsheathe an iPhone, and snap a quick selfie. Kelly, the stalwart, septuagenarian politician, has found a new generation of fans, many of whom are too young even to vote. Kelly\u2019s command of contemporary rap vernacular is curiously precise. Impressive too is his fluency in the language of memes: scarcely does he misuse a Gif or hashtag, or deploy a \u201cbae\u201d when he really means \u201cwoes\u201d. Young people, meanwhile, have a low tolerance for imposters and a keen eye for spotting the fakes. They\u2019re quick to call out politicians like Hillary Clinton for trying to sound hip, and lately some have been wondering if Kelly has someone else pulling the levers behind the scenes. Kelly slammed Meek Mill when Mill insisted Drake employed a ghostwriter. Now Kelly is often accused of the same.  The chief suspect is Jerry Nasr, a special assistant in Kelly\u2019s office. Toronto media tend to refer to Nasr\u2019s presence in the office in a somewhat accusatory way: there are often \u201crumors\u201d of his involvement with the Twitter account, or suggestions that his purview extends beyond what he claims. \u201cWith pictures and stuff,\u201d he told me vaguely, when I asked outright in what way he helped.     Norm Kelly: \u2018I innocently strayed on to the rap battlefield.\u2019 Photograph: Irvine James    Kelly elaborated: \u201cOne of the things I learned, early on, was that a tweet that uses a visual gets more viewers than just text. I asked Jerry if he could do the time-consuming search for photographs to illustrate what I\u2019m looking for. If he finds something that really intrigues him, he brings it to my attention.\u201d Nasr, too, keeps Kelly \u201cup to date with what\u2019s trending\u201d, but the content, he insists, \u201cis all Norm\u201d.  For Kelly, the practice is an expression of his sensibility. \u201cI grew up on Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx, Monty Python. To have an outlet for the comic sense I\u2019ve developed over the years really strikes me as something fun.\u201d The strategy has clearly been successful: people adore Norm. But his popularity among millennials is not without complications. Kelly\u2019s high profile has made him the target of a number of vitriolic local editorials \u2013 most of which insinuate that time in the spotlight is time he could be doing the mundane work of politics, echoing the problems pundits in the country have had with Justin Trudeau\u2019s winning charm \u2013and has trained on him a high degree of scrutiny.    I grew up on Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx, Monty Python. To have an outlet for the comic sense I\u2019ve developed is fun  Norm Kelly     Whatever drawbacks stardom brings, Kelly can be assured of one ally: Drake, the 6 God himself. Not long after his skirmish with Meek Mill, Kelly received word of a social invitation: Drake wanted him to be his guest at OVO Fest, the annual concert he hosts in Toronto. But Kelly couldn\u2019t make it.  They were fated to meet again. Last autumn, Kelly was invited by a local university\u2019s student union to attend a free outdoor concert \u2013 an invitation extended with ulterior motives. \u201cThey told me they had invited Drake,\u201d Kelly remembers. \u201cSigns, as they read them, indicated there was a pretty good chance Drake would be there. They said if I could come and meet him, that would be the cherry on top.\u201d Drake did indeed turn up, and he welcomed Kelly warmly. \u201cWe chatted very comfortably,\u201d Kelly says, understandably pleased. (Kelly, of course, had company: \u201cJerry came and brought his girlfriend.\u201d) Since then, the pair have been friendly. \u201cI saw Drake at a Toronto Raptors game recently,\u201d Kelly tells me. \u201cI approached him to say hello. He sensed me coming. He turned to look at me, and his first words were, \u20186 Dad!\u2019\u201d",
