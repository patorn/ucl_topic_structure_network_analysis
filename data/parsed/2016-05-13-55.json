  "body": "Frankel remains unbeaten. More than three years after the great horse retired on a score of 14 wins from 14 races, he is now one from one as a stallion, his son Cunco having overcome terrible greenness to win here.   Related: Timeform on Frankel: 'No horse in our 66 years would have beaten him'    \u201cGreenness\u201d doesn\u2019t really do justice to Cunco\u2019s pre-race behaviour, which, even by the standards of your average inexperienced two-year-old, was extremely wayward. He pranced and he whinnied. He reared up and smacked his head on the ceiling of a saddling box, to the evident terror of the grooms who were trying to tack him up. Most obviously of all, he sported an impressive erection for nearly the whole of his time in the paddock, to the extent that some photographers complained they had been left without a single photograph that would be likely to make it into print, certainly not in the more conservative publications. This is what is meant, in racing circles, when people allude euphemistically to a horse being \u201ccoltish\u201d. It is generally accepted as a perfectly good excuse for a poor subsequent effort on the track. By the time Cunco cantered to the start, throwing his head around and generally behaving as if he had no idea what he was doing here, his odds had doubled to 4-1. A late renewal of interest took him back to 7-2 but the consensus, at least in the press room, was that the chance of Frankel making a flying start to his second career had been reduced almost to zero. This just goes to show what expert opinion is worth because Cunco appeared much more professional in the race. While he took a deal of niggling from his jockey, Rab Havlin, he was never too far off the pace and showed a deeply impressive turn of foot in the final furlong to cut down his rivals. To say he looked like Frankel is not merely to point out that his hide is broadly the same colour and with similar markings. He is smaller than his sire but put together along quite similar lines, also wears a cross-noseband suggestive of a free-running habit and also takes quite a bit of pulling up after crossing the line. The way he towed Havlin round to the 10-furlong start on the far side of the course was strongly reminiscent of what Frankel did after winning the Greenham Stakes here five years ago. Frankel as a stallion cannot, of course, be judged on his very first runner and, since most of his progeny are likely to be the type to peak at the age of three and older, we won\u2019t know his true worth in his second career until at least the middle of next year. But this was an encouraging start after a certain amount of backstage fretting over the fact that his progeny are \u201call shapes and sizes\u201d rather than being a succession of mini-Frankels. Cunco may get another chance to advertise his father at Royal Ascot next month, since the Chesham Stakes there is rated \u201ca strong possibility\u201d by John Gosden, the winning trainer. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get the stallion off the mark,\u201d Gosden said afterwards.   Related: First Frankel foal sold for \u00a31.15m by Goffs at Kensington Palace auction    \u201cHe\u2019s shown a great attitude and galloped out extremely strongly.\u201d Asked about Cunco\u2019s pre-race behaviour, the trainer said: \u201cI never mind that, he\u2019s quite a character and full of himself and it\u2019s his first time at the races. Though of course his father didn\u2019t do that, he was quite business-like.\u201d Havlin said his mount had run \u201cas if he\u2019d been to school three times, you know? He\u2019s never been asked any serious questions at home yet. We didn\u2019t go very fast and five of them got first run on me off a slow pace, so he had a bit to do. It took him 10 strides and he really hit a top gear. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a few more gears left, as well.\u201d The jockey was sanguine on the issue of Cunco\u2019s arousal in the paddock. \u201cI rode him out yesterday and he done the same on the way in but there\u2019s no harm in him, no malice and when he gets about his business, he seems to forget all that stuff. Hopefully, he might need that tackle later on in life.\u201d",
