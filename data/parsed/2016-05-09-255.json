But for many people attending the Wimbledon tennis tournament requires either luck in a long-odds ticket ballot or queuing for hours \u2013 if not days. Not for Bob Germon and his wife Sue, though, who first bought Wimbledon five-year debentures in 2007 then again in 2012 which have given them two tickets for prime seats on No 1 Court for each of the first 10 days of the tournament.  The last set of debentures, which the All England Club issues in order to carry out works such as stadium and ground developments, cost \u00a313,700 each, but despite the high price the tennis-loving couple, who are both 65, have pretty much made their money back by selling on some of the tickets. \u201cWe usually attend No 1 Court matches at least four days of each tournament, either giving the remaining tickets to family or friends, or selling them via eBay or ticket agencies which buy from debenture holders,\u201d Bob says. \u201cSo far sales have been sufficient to almost break even, while attending on the days we want.\u201d    It\u2019s a significant outlay, but perhaps fair value for committed fans given the potential returns from selling tickets    In April, the club announced plans to issue 1,000 new debentures for 2017-2022, which gives the owner not just a premier ticket to No 1 Court \u2013 all close to the action with excellent views \u2013 but also exclusive access to lounges, restaurants and bars which are not open to the public. They are also the only tickets that can be legally traded, potentially for big sums. Pairs of tickets for this year\u2019s men\u2019s quarter finals on No 1 Court, the most valuable tickets debenture holders can sell, are on offer for about \u00a32,500. The debentures themselves can also be sold on, with the last three sales averaging \u00a318,600.  The trouble for buyers this time round, is that Wimbledon has set the price much higher than 2007 \u2013 indeed, a lot higher \u2013 at \u00a331,000 each. It is hoping to raise \u00a325m before expenses for improvements, including a roof for No 1 Court and an additional 900 seats, to bring total capacity for the court to 12,400.

But \u00a331,000 for 50 tickets \u2013 10 per tournament for five years \u2013 works out at \u00a3620 a ticket. It\u2019s a huge investment, not just for dedicated tennis fans but for anyone hoping to recoup the cost with ticket sales. Even the keenest football fans at the Premier League\u2019s most expensive club, Arsenal, only have to fork out \u00a32,013 for the best season tickets.  Ben Kumar of Seven Investment Management says: \u201cWhile past performance of debentures as an investment has been quite good, there can be no guarantees for the future. Demand for debentures and tickets that go with them could fluctuate if the popularity of tennis took a sharp dip, or the economy suffered a slowdown, reducing discretionary spending. But, that said, attendances at Wimbledon didn\u2019t seem to suffer after the 2008 recession \u2013 with queues longer than ever.\u201d He reckons that although debentures are usually the preserve of the very well-off, there will be interest from some buyers cashing in part of their pension. \u201cEarlier access to pension pots and money made from increases in house prices, coupled with good earnings from career success, makes buying a possibility for more people than you might think \u2013 especially given the potential income from selling on tickets or a debenture.\u201d     A computer-generated image of the planned No1 court to be completed in 2019.

The cost of a debenture needs thinking about, but an accountant told me there comes a time when enjoying leisure is more of a priority.

Being close to the action in the intimacy of No 1 Court can be emotional experience \u2013 almost like actually playing \u2013 and exhausting, but in a good way.\u201d Walking the 19 acres of grounds is another pleasure for Margaret. \u201cAs an Australian who has lived in this country for 50 years, the \u2018tennis in an English country garden\u2019 tradition of Wimbledon has a powerful appeal,\u201d she says.  \u201cI return home every year for the Australian Open and while the tennis is just as good, the music played at Melbourne Park is just not Wimbledon.\u201d For Bob and Sue Germon, it\u2019s the full day experience they enjoy most. They always arrive early, enjoy a coffee in the lounge, Pimm\u2019s in the grounds, lunch in the alfresco restaurant, \u201cthen tennis, tea break, more tennis and finally home exhausted after a long and memorable time\u201d.

Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    Sue adds: \u201cFriends and family are always blown away by the experience of using our debenture tickets \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t want to use them every day as you can have too much of a good thing! It\u2019s great to be able to sell the ones we don\u2019t use at a good price.\u201d   Related: Is investing in debentures a good idea?    Bob is planning to apply for two debentures, but he believes the margins for selling-on tickets from them might be too low. \u201cI think the issue has been priced a little high,\u201d he says. But more than half of the main draw singles matches played in No 1 Court last year featured top-five seeds, which makes tennis insiders believe the latest debenture offer is likely to be over-subscribed, despite the price hike. The club\u2019s finance director, Richard Atkinson, says: \u201cTime will tell on the popularity of this offer, but early indications suggest keen interest. \u201cWe hope existing debenture holders will apply for the new issue \u2013 they will be first in line if the offer is oversubscribed, as happened with the last issue of Centre Court debentures \u2013 while we\u2019re also happy to welcome new holders whose enjoyment of Wimbledon will be taken to a new level.\u201d Alan Higgins, chief UK investment officer for Coutts Bank, says: \u201cIt\u2019s a significant outlay, but perhaps fair value for committed tennis fans, given the added potential for returns from selling on tickets.\u201d But will he be applying? \u201cAs a huge tennis fan, I might well be.\u201d  He has also identified another motive for holding debentures \u2013 altruism. \u201cUsing spare tickets to raise money for charity can be very appealing, and it\u2019s something a lot of people might like to consider doing.\u201d Debenture applications can be made at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, at aeltc.com.",
