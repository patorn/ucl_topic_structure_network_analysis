  "body": "Andros Townsend is confident Rafael Ben\u00edtez would be capable of not only returning Newcastle United to the Premier League at the first attempt but swiftly transforming the club into a force.   Related: Newcastle move pays off for Andros Townsend as he earns Euro 2016 chance    Ben\u00edtez was said to be \u201cvery pleased\u201d after unexpected, two-hour talks with Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, on Sunday and seems to be inching towards agreeing to remain on Tyneside next season. The Spaniard \u2013 serenaded throughout his team\u2019s 5-1 home weekend win over Tottenham \u2013 has a break clause in the three-year contract he signed in March but does not appear minded to exercise it. Ben\u00edtez continued what were said to be \u201cpositive and productive\u201d negotiations with Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director, on Monday with the intention of resolving things one way or the other by the end of next week at the very latest. \u201cIt would be massive for Newcastle to keep Rafa as manager,\u201d said Townsend, who was recalled to the England squad on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best managers in the world. If we can keep a manager of that calibre and keep doing the right things we\u2019ll build. We won\u2019t cut corners but we\u2019ll build for the future and come straight back into the Premier League. Then we\u2019ll be up there challenging in the Premier League because that\u2019s what the manager wants to do.\u201d Townsend\u2019s frustration is that Ben\u00edtez \u2013 who replaced Steve McClaren \u2013 came too late to prevent the slide into the Championship. \u201cWe\u2019re six games unbeaten and the form\u2019s really picked up and the players have really grown in confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing six games unbeaten is an incredible achievement for a relegated team. We were just unfortunate that, this season, Sunderland were equally fantastic in the closing weeks and just managed to pip us. I\u2019m gutted the club season\u2019s over. But now we have to take some positives, regroup and build again for next season.\u201d The winger \u2013 who arrived for \u00a312m from Spurs in January but has an \u00a38m release clause in his \u00a380,000-a-week contract \u2013 refuses to be drawn on whether he will be around next season but is believed to be a player Ben\u00edtez would be anxious to retain. Whether the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager will still be able to make those decisions depends on him being offered guarantees of autonomy over assorted areas of the club, including recruitment. This will involve Ashley ripping up his old, failed Newcastle blueprint but Ben\u00edtez wants to be confident he will be given a strong enough squad to make an immediate escape from the Championship. Ashley\u2019s rare appearance at St James\u2019 Park on Sunday facilitated the pair\u2019s first meeting, with the owner having been anxious to meet Ben\u00edtez last week. Ben\u00edtez postponed discussions until this week but, clearly keen to accelerate the deal, Ashley pre-empted matters by turning up at the Spurs match on an evident charm offensive.",
