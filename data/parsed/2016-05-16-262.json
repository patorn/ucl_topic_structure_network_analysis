  "body": "Double standards are nothing new on TV, but Monkey can\u2019t help but sympathise with those Twitter users expressing their incredulity at the puritan behaviour of Los Angeles TV station KLTA, which on Sunday decided that the dress worn on air by weather reporter Libert\u00e9 Chan was so revealing it needed covering up, in the middle of a report, with a demure grey cardigan.  The cardigan was proffered by the disembodied hand of news anchor Chris Burrous, supposedly in response to emails from outraged and presumably easily shocked viewers.   Related: If you wear high heels, kick yourself | Carole Cadwalladr    Chan\u2019s cool on-air response and later apology and promise not to wear the dress again were greeted with praise, but the behaviour of the station itself did not go down well with many online, who made perfectly reasonable comments such as \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d, \u201cGrow up and stop acting like Isis\u201d, and, perhaps most pertinently, \u201cMen are never asked this question. Wear whatever you want!\u201d    Wow!
