Photograph: Quercus    McNeil was speaking about the imminent launch of a series of Famous Five parodies, hot on the heels of the sales triumph of the Ladybird books for grown-ups. (Think of those lovely Peter and Jane books, except Peter is a hipster and Jane has a hangover). This Christmas, we can look forward to the continued adventures of Julian, Dick, George and Anne as adults, along with Timmy the dog who must be about 400 in dog years by now \u2013 in Five Give Up the Booze, Five Go Gluten Free, Five Go On A Strategy Away Day and Five Go Parenting. A few details from Five Go Gluten Free, to give you a flavour of what\u2019s in store: the gang \u201care all feeling really rather rum, and it\u2019s been going on for days. Nothing seems to work, and with their doctors mystified, they\u2019re driven to trying out various expedients to cure themselves. Julian goes online to self-diagnose that he\u2019s got pancreatic cancer, bird flu and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Anne decides that the old methods are the best and decides to have herself exorcised \u2013 which proves to be an awful lot of bother for everyone, and such a mess. Dick goes to a witch doctor who calls himself a \u2018homeopath\u2019 (\u201csounds only one short of sociopath, Dick!\u201d) but it\u2019s George who discovers they need to go on an exclusion diet, so they enter a world of hard-to-find, maddeningly expensive specialist foods \u2026\u201d Are we sure, really, that Blyton \u201cwould have delighted\u201d in this \u201cgentle parody\u201d? Her daughter, Imogen Smallwood, doesn\u2019t appear to be convinced, telling the Mail: \u201cOh my goodness, I know absolutely nothing about them. It is completely news to me and I don\u2019t think I want to know.\u201d Whether she\u2019d be delighted by much on these characters is another question; Smallwood doesn\u2019t paint a particularly gentle portrait of her mother, saying in 2002 that \u201cthe truth is, Enid Blyton was arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and without a trace of maternal instinct\u201d.   Related: Ladybird book pastiches become stocking-filler hit of 2015    Whether or not these parodies would count as something difficult and unpleasant for Blyton, it\u2019s not the first time the Five have been reimagined, and it won\u2019t be the last. Whether it\u2019s Jennifer Saunders et al Going Mad in Dorset (\u201cI say Jule, that man looks foreign!\u201d):            \u2026 Lucy Mangan ripping them apart in this very paper:  \u201cIt says the Famous Five are still the most popular children\u2019s books ever,\u201d said George, wolfing down a slice of delicious fruit cake they had bought from the local paedophile \u2013 sorry, red-cheeked farmer and his wife - that morning. \u201cI call that pretty ripping,\u201d said Julian as Anne brushed the crumbs from his pullover and flagellated herself with a willow branch for being a girl.  ... Or the non-Blyton-penned continuing adventures that I read as a child.  I chose these because I was desperate for more from the Kirrin Island crew, even as they dropped it into a unbearable meta-hell in titles like Famous Five Go on Television. It seemed then, as it does now, that the Famous Five really can\u2019t die.   Related: Enid Blyton's Famous Five get 21st-century makeover    There are, of course, issues around Blyton\u2019s attitude to race and class; her publisher recently adapted her language, changing very \u201cof their time\u201d phrases such as \u201cdirty tinker\u201d to \u201ctraveller\u201d. But she remains one of the UK\u2019s most popular writers. So I imagine that the latest parodies (\u201cWho\u2019s been sneaking messages through the hotel dumb waiter about secret assignations? Is there a smuggler\u2019s plot afoot? Or is Shelly from Production shagging Postroom Luke?\u201d) will be just as popular as the pastiche Ladybirds, which according to the Bookseller have sold 1.74m copies to date. I can see exactly why those have done so well \u2013 I just wish they were actually funny, rather than endless variations on \u201cHo ho, mums like to drink\u201d and \u201cdads don\u2019t look after babies very well, do they?\u201d Fingers crossed, the Famous Five reworkings are something better. Meanwhile, let\u2019s brace ourselves for an inevitable onslaught of gifty spoofs of other favourite children\u2019s books by the end of the year. Spiffing.",
