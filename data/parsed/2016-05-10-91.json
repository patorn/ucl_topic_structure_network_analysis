  "body": "In March, a poll found that nearly 20% of Americans would consider moving to Canada if a Trump presidency comes to pass. Well, the dream doesn\u2019t have to be mere fantasy any longer. A new company has arrived that intends to help whisk the country\u2019s jaded abroad. Maple Match is a matchmaking service like none other. In the words of its website, it \u201cmakes it easy for Americans to find the ideal Canadian partner to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency\u201d. The app, in other words, wants to help Trump-averse singles find love \u2013 and perhaps a new country to call home. At the moment, eager singles can sign up for early access when the dating app launches properly. And when it does, many thousands of unhappy Americans and generous Canadians will be paired.

A self-described man of \u201cliberal persuasions\u201d living in a red state, Goldman says he has a natural affinity for Canada and its progressive leftwing image. Maple Match is a manifestation of his dual passions: connecting different people and his neighbors to the north. \u201cWhen this election came about and I started seeing Donald Trump and the rise of his candidacy I started getting concerned, just like anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it might be interesting to try something like this out.\u201d  At first his ambitions were modest: \u201cLast week I had a hundred page views and I thought that was a great \u2013 I made a hundred people smile.\u201d But then virality transformed Maple Match into an international craze. Last Friday, Maple Match was getting 200 sign-up requests an hour. Today nearly 5,000 singles have signed up for Maple Match \u2013 and the app hasn\u2019t even launched.     Today nearly 5,000 singles have signed up for Maple Match \u2013 and the app hasn\u2019t even launched    Goldman has attracted Americans and Canadians alike \u2013 the former hoping to get out of the US and the latter glad to harbor them. Maple Match has been fielding all sorts of desperate pleas. \u201cPlease help me,\u201d a 22-year-old American writes on his Maple Match application. \u201cI found out my parents are voting for Trump and it literally broke my heart.\u201d \u201cI want to meet an American woman who disapproves of Trump,\u201d writes one Canadian. \u201cShe must be willing to become a hockey fan and eat maple syrup and Beaver Tails in my igloo.\u201d Adriana Floridia, a 23-year-old single woman living in Toronto, told me that she thinks Maple Match sounds like a nice idea. \u201cMaybe this is a chance for people to finally meet their soulmates,\u201d she said. Goldman thinks this is the right attitude. \u201cThis is about finding the right partner and not caring if they\u2019re on the other side of the border,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that person happens to be from Nunavut or Nebraska, great. You should go to a place where you\u2019ll be happy. For a number of Americans, in the event of a Trump presidency, that place would be Canada.\u201d   Related: Blame Canada? US Senate committee ponders if northern border is a threat    The gag-like aspect of the Maple Match premise has of course aided its ascent to global virality. But Goldman insists that the men and women who have so far signed up think of this as much more than a fleeting joke. \u201cAmericans are using this as a serious opportunity to meet Canadians. People have been sending me paragraphs of explanation. People have been sending me pictures of themselves. I\u2019ve had people begging me to start this. We\u2019re not just building an anti-Trump app. We\u2019re building something that connects people across borders, and that\u2019s something that has the potential to grow.\u201d Right now it seems the only hurdle is if Trump\u2019s aspirations don\u2019t come to fruition. Will Maple Match connect Americans with Canadians if Americans have no good reason to abscond? \u201cIt\u2019s funny thinking that if Trump goes away there will be no more Maple Match,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cBut while the humor is there to generate attention, what will ultimately interest people is their passion for finding someone who means something to them.\u201d And Goldman believes that desire will endure even if the Democrats happen to win. \u201cThis site shows that a lot of people are frustrated with the current dating options,\u201d he saids. \u201cA lot of Americans really want to meet Canadians. They\u2019re looking for something new and something better.\u201d",
