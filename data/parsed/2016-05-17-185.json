  "body": "In these pages we recently published a piece on the hidden pressures of professional rugby union. There was a significant response, including one email that should be compulsory reading for the game\u2019s authorities. Ben Hooper is a 28-year-old prop forward plying his trade in the Championship and, on behalf of every player in the second tier of English rugby, he feels compelled to speak out. Hooper is the younger brother of Bath\u2019s recently-retired captain Stuart Hooper but, despite pursuing a career in the same sport, he inhabits a parallel universe. Championship players, he alleges, are being let down by their own union, receive insufficient funding from the Rugby Football Union and are open to exploitation by people with scant interest in their physical or mental well-being. \u201cWe are rugby\u2019s forgotten men,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe take the same risks, put in the same hours and make the same sacrifices with few of the benefits. The RFU Championship has become the wild west of professional rugby.\u201d   Related: Rugby union\u2019s brutal reality: the physical and mental toll of an elite playing career | Michael Aylwin    If either the RFU or the Rugby Players\u2019 Association is interested, on the eve of this week\u2019s play-off final first leg between Bristol and Doncaster Hooper is aware of numerous horror stories. Many player contracts, for example, contain weasel clauses allowing clubs to dismiss players on the flimsiest pretext. One club once told a player it would pay his wages for only 11 months of the year, rather than 12, because there were no matches in June. Another coach, having announced a swingeing wage cut, gave players just seven days to sign up to the reduced terms or be summarily released. In one recent Championship match, there were delays in assessing players from both sides for potential concussion because of a shortage of available medical expertise. The Guardian has also learned, from another source, of a Championship club where funds earmarked for players\u2019 insurance were used to sign extra players, with existing squad members told to arrange their own cover. Hooper, who is joining Nottingham this summer after four years at Yorkshire Carnegie, loves his sport but feels enough is enough. \u201cYorkshire Carnegie and Nottingham have been fantastic with me and done their upmost to support me,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut I know a number of other players who aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d He says Championship players are not asking for the earth \u2013 they mostly earn a fraction of their Premiership cousins \u2013 but are seeking fairer treatment. As a minimum requirement they want the RPA to lobby for the standard contracts that exist for Premiership players, a league-wide contract negotiation window, a minimum wage for Championship players funded by the RFU, basic health cover and a union rep at every Championship club. At present Championship sides receive \u00a3530,000 apiece in annual central funding in a deal that extends until 2020, but those at the sharp end argue this is insufficient to fund a fully professional second tier. Unless things change, warns Hooper, English rugby will not just stand accused of letting down tomorrow\u2019s young stars, for whom the Championship remains an essential proving ground, but of turning its back on its most vulnerable constituents. He also believes the RPA \u201cfails to do its job of protecting players\u201d by concentrating almost exclusively on the Premiership. \u201cThey do offer a \u2018Championship Membership\u2019 which costs \u00a385 but the benefits are negligible. Tax advice and 20% off a \u00a33,000 television aren\u2019t at the forefront of your mind when you have two months left of a contract worth \u00a310,000 a year and bills to pay.\u201d   Related: Alex Corbisiero: \u2018Even now people will frown if you say you need a rest\u2019    It is a daunting equation. Hooper repeatedly makes clear he considers himself fortunate to pursue rugby as a career but the realities of his \u201cdream job\u201d can be desperately stark. \u201cWhen I left university I did what everyone else does, I got a job. I joined a local rugby club and played on a Saturday. I played well, got spotted by a coach at a Championship club and he offered me my first professional contract worth \u00a311,000. This was half of what I was earning in my graduate job at a sports marketing agency. What I didn\u2019t realise is that as a tighthead prop I\u2019d managed to do quite well. \u201cThere were people in the squad on \u00a36,000 a year. I don\u2019t expect the wages to be of a Premiership standard \u2013 rugby is a business \u2013 but there should be a minimum level to avoid player exploitation. Anything goes from the clubs and as players we have little or no option but to go along with it. We have no voice, and nowhere to turn.\u201d Hooper also fears many players are struggling to cope mentally in an environment boasting none of the financial advantages of top-flight rugby yet all of its inherent dangers. \u201cThe pressures of professional sport are rigorous; you are watched and analysed on everything, day in, day out. Imagine taking those risks while earning less than \u00a310,000 a year? I have had my dark days throughout my career and I\u2019m sure there are more to come. I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019ve got a degree and work experience. The majority of Championship players do not.\u201d When contacted by the Guardian, the RPA\u2019s chief executive Damian Hopley said he sympathised with the players\u2019 predicament but stressed the RPA was itself \u201chamstrung\u201d and \u201ccompromised\u201d by a lack of funding. The RFU, in a statement, insisted it remained \u201cfully committed to the development of a professional English second-tier competition.\u201d It can only be hoped more help is forthcoming. Hooper is the very best kind of whistleblower, motivated simply by a desire to assist every professional player, not just the elite few. He also knows this is a story not everyone wants to hear. \u201cWhen cyclists first started to talk about drugs in the grand tours and breaking the code of silence it was referred to as \u201cspitting in the soup\u201d. I feel this is the same with the true state of professionalism in rugby. On the outside everything is rosy. The sport is growing, a deal has just been done to increase funding for Premiership clubs to an eye-watering \u00a36m a year. I think, however, that I have a responsibility to spit in the soup.\u201d He is doing so on behalf of all \u201cforgotten men\u201d and his message should be shouted from every rooftop.",
