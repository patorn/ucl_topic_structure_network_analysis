  "body": "Versions of Alan Bennett have been hard to escape over the last six months. First came Nicholas Hytner\u2019s film of The\u00a0Lady in the Van, featuring three depictions of its author \u2013 Alex Jennings as both \u201cAlan Bennett\u201d, a diffident north London resident in the 70s and 80s, and \u201cAB\u201d the observing writer, plus a present-day cameo from Bennett himself. Besides his 2015 diary in the LRB, edited by his friend Mary-Kay Wilmers, subsequent sightings have included a\u00a0regional revival of the autobiographical play Untold Stories, and the Radio 4 comedy Boswell\u2019s Life of Bennett, in\u00a0which the time-travelling biographer (Miles Jupp) repeatedly urges the Yorkshireman (Alistair McGowan) to reveal his secrets \u2013 \u201cthe cream cracker under the settee\u201d \u2013 only to be told \u201cDon\u2019t be daft\u201d. Next up is Nick Hornby\u2019s TV reworking (starting on Friday on\u00a0BBC1) of Love, Nina, Nina Stibbe\u2019s droll epistolary account of her time as Wilmers\u2019s nanny, in which another \u201cAB\u201d continually pops up as a supper-sharing dispenser of practical domestic tips. Yet, for whatever reason \u2013 Stibbe has wryly inferred he was \u201cmardy because I\u00a0exposed him as a\u00a0handyman\u201d \u2013 the book\u2019s AB becomes Jason Watkins\u2019s Malcolm, a\u00a0bald, vain Scottish poet, and\u00a0its Wilmers is Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s Georgia (the\u00a0pair do,\u00a0however, remain bookish Camden neighbours, and Wilmers\u2019s home setup\u00a0and job are\u00a0unaltered). Bennett\u2019s near-ubiquity has a\u00a0paradoxical quality: a playwright who\u00a0made his name with studies of\u00a0shy, lonely and socially invisible people (who he clearly identified with) has become significantly more high profile than peers such as David Hare and Tom\u00a0Stoppard, and arguably among the most famous British authors ever. How\u00a0has this happened? It helps if you are also a\u00a0performer, and consequently your face and voice have long been recognisable (Beyond the Fringe, including Bennett\u2019s vicar sketch, was recorded for TV in 1964). Subsequently he has appeared regularly in other writers\u2019 work, often as the academic he once was (Hugh Trevor-Roper in Selling Hitler, Lord Pinkrose in Fortunes of\u00a0War), as well as creating, and in some cases playing, characters that clearly reflect aspects of himself, from his bevy of 50\u2011plus women to gay or latently gay figures such as Graham in his TV series Talking Heads, Anthony Blunt in A Question of Attribution and Hector in\u00a0The\u00a0History Boys. What helps too is other people portraying you. ITV\u2019s Spitting Image, in\u00a0which Bennett\u2019s puppet (voiced by Steve Nallon) could usually be found taking tea with Thora Hird\u2019s, both confirmed his celebrity status and magnified it tenfold. And during its run from 1984 to 1996 appeared a\u00a0breakthrough work that saw him writing about himself directly for the\u00a0first time.     Alex Jennings as Alan Bennett and Maggie Smith as Miss Shepherd in The Lady in the Van (2015). Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films    Writing Home (1994) was a bestselling collection of diaries and other prose (including The Lady in the\u00a0Van) that can be seen not as a\u00a0riposte to his Spitting Image image, but as complementing it; the latex lampooners teased him as twee and tweedy, and he sent himself up as timid and fastidious. Other Bennetts emerge too, though, that aren\u2019t so cosy, and he has frequently signalled unease that these spikier selves tend to get forgotten. Writing Home led to the playwright appearing as a stage or screen character, first in the 1999 theatre adaptation of Miss Shepherd\u2019s story, and to a more general loosening up whereby the once-wary Bennett began offering opinions and freely discussing his private life.   Related: Alex Jennings on playing Alan Bennett: 'He wanted me to be tougher'    This incremental acceptance of greater exposure makes it all the harder to guess why Love, Nina\u2019s makers felt they had to leave him out. Possibly the book\u2019s AB was perceived as a variant form of cosyfication, as Stibbe sensed. But it could be that Bennett saw in her book a kind of claim-jumping: his 60s TV series On the Margin (best known through the Mark Boxer cartoon strip about the Stringalongs it inspired) anticipated it by almost 50 years in spoofing a Camden set of intellectuals and media types. Or the solution to the puzzle is even simpler: Bennett was \u201cmuch funnier than I tell\u201d, Stibbe has also said, perhaps sheepishly aware that she shows sensible, stolid AB being repeatedly outshone by MK\u2019s pithy witticisms. If\u00a0Bennett did object to being depicted by her as\u00a0unfunny, he has paid\u00a0a cruel price \u2013 the\u00a0character who replaces him is a humourless bore.",
