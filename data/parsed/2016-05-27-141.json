But this weekend, Thomas Becket\u2019s elbow will make a solemn, if fleeting, return from Esztergom, in Hungary, to Canterbury, the seat of his clerical authority \u2013 and the scene of his brutal murder. At 3pm on Saturday, a group of pilgrims, Hungarian dignitaries and interested onlookers will assemble at St Michael\u2019s church in Harbledown to follow in the footsteps of medieval pilgrims chronicled in The Canterbury Tales. From the village described by Geoffrey Chaucer as \u201cbobbe-up-and-doun\u201d, they will walk an hour to Canterbury Cathedral. Their ancient forerunners\u2019 purpose was \u201cthe hooly blisful martir for to seke\u201d; theirs is to bring the sacred relic home.

Encased in a jewelled reliquary, the bone fragment has been accompanied by Hungary\u2019s president, J\u00e1nos \u00c1der, celebrated in parliament and blessed by both Becket\u2019s successor, Justin Welby, and the leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, Vincent Nichols. Becket Week \u2013 an initiative by the Hungarian embassy \u2013 has generated a wave of public curiosity and a chance for the Anglican and Catholic churches to show that reconciliation has replaced historical division.  \u201cWe responded [to the proposal] with enormous joy,\u201d Robert Willis, the dean of Canterbury, told the Guardian. It was a chance \u201cto honour something precious, and also to honour eight centuries of pilgrimage\u201d. Becket was appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 1161 by his friend King Henry II, who wanted an ally in the crown\u2019s tousles with the church. Almost overnight, however, Becket turned extremely pious, donning a sackcloth shirt, consuming only bread and water, spurning riches and staunchly defending the faith.

A few years later, in 1170, he returned but swiftly angered Henry by excommunicating the archbishop of York who had sided with the king against Rome. Henry allegedly exclaimed: \u201cWill no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\u201d On 29 December, four knights entered the cathedral and hacked Becket to death in front of the high altar, creating an instant martyr. He was canonised just two years later and his shrine became a magnet for pilgrims across Europe, inspiring Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales. When Becket was reburied in 1220, relics from his body \u2013 fragments of bone, scraps of cloth \u2013 were taken and dispersed across Europe, with a shard of his elbow ending up in Esztergom. Three centuries later, during the Reformation, Henry VIII \u2013 determined to kill off the cult of St Thomas \u2013 ordered his shrine to be destroyed and his remains obliterated. The veneration of saints\u2019 relics was condemned by the Protestant king as an idolatrous Catholic practice. Where Becket\u2019s shrine once stood, a candle now burns 24 hours a day. Willis said: \u201cIn the marble stones, you can still trace the dents made by the knees of thousands of pilgrims. Thomas\u2019s body may no longer be with us, but his ethos and DNA is still here.\u201d   Related: The enduring fascination of relics, from Becket\u2019s elbow to Elvis\u2019s Graceland | Lindsey Fitzharris    The relic later \u201cbecame a symbol of Catholic resistance under atheistic communism in Hungary. Now there is a sense of liberation from all that,\u201d he said. This week was a \u201cpilgrimage of thanksgiving\u201d. Andrew Tremlett, the rector of St Margaret\u2019s Westminster, the church of the House of Commons, where the relic was displayed this week, said: \u201cThe significance of Becket\u2019s martyrdom was felt around Europe.\u201d It spoke to the troubled relationship between church and state still felt in many places in the 21st century. \u201cHere in the UK, religious faith is perfectly normal in the public sphere. But there are plenty of countries and circumstances where that\u2019s not the case. Even here, there must be space for religious leaders to ask taxing questions,\u201d said Tremlett. At a Becket symposium at Lambeth Palace, Nichols acknowledged that the relationship between church and state was always a point of tension. \u201cSt Thomas\u2019s martyrdom reminds us what can happen when the state seeks to dominate religious belief and reshape it to its own ends, to its own selection of values. When observance of those particular values become absolute requirements then we are on a path of confrontation,\u201d he said.

Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters    Interest in the relic has been surprisingly high, said Tremlett. \u201cThe veneration of relics is not within the western European cultural mindset. But here we are on an ordinary weekday morning, and people are coming in to see it.\u201d He added: \u201cI understand that something like this provides a sense of connectedness to a special individual. I wouldn\u2019t ascribe a spiritual property to a relic, but I understand and respect that people do. We like to think of ourselves as purely rationalistic, but here, this week, in the heart of our liberal democracy, this act of veneration was going on.\u201d No one could estimate how many people are expected to show up on Saturday for the last leg of the modern-day St Thomas Becket pilgrimage. After arriving at the west doors of the cathedral, the relic will be taken to the crypt for prayers and contemplation. Following a Catholic mass on Sunday, the tiny fragment will return to Hungary. \u201cWe are steeped in Becket here, and this week\u2019s reconnection is very special, but the relic belongs in Esztergom,\u201d said Willis.",
