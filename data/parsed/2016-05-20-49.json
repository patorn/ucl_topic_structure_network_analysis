  "body": "Sometimes, while James Allen Darland delivered packages for his postal company, he would also have sex with dogs. Stray dogs, or the dogs of people he delivered to. He also had sex with sheep, horses, and other dogs, whose owners he contacted over Craigslist. In exchange, he often let the owners of the animals have sex with his own dog, Wiley. Darland lived in Seattle, Washington, but was tempted down to Phoenix, Arizona, by one particular online ad.   Related: The face of American fascism? Decoding sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s anti-bestiality video    That\u2019s where he ran into Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s favorite sheriff, who is mentioned in almost all of the Republican candidate\u2019s speeches, and was one of the first elected officials to endorse Trump in his bid for President \u2013 is running a sophisticated sting operation which aims to entrap people like Darland who want to engage in sexual acts with animals. The operation posts fake ads on Craigslist or responds to them and then arresting the alleged perpetrators when they turn up. In a video posted to his Facebook page on 6 May, Arpaio boasted of the program\u2019s 10th arrest, a suspect \u201cwho negotiated through the Craigslist\u201d, to meet an undercover detective in order to have sex with his dog. In the video he warned of \u201ca group of people going around the nation called \u2018zoo-sexual\u2019, that has warned everyone to beware of this sheriff and his crackdown on bestiality laws\u201d.

In the early 2000s he had set up a unit to investigate animal cruelty, and in 2006 they were referred the case of Leroy Johnson, a deputy fire chief with the Mesa fire department, who had been reported by a neighbor \u2013 a farmer named Alan Goats, incidentally \u2013 for sneaking into his barn and trying to have sex with one of Goats\u2019 lambs. Confronted while bent over the animal with his pants down, according to the police report, Johnson said, \u201cYou caught me, Alan, I tried to fuck your sheep\u201d. Johnson was charged under public indecency statutes, but the case inspired Arpaio to go to the legislature and demand that bestiality be made against the law. \u201cThis is one of my crusades,\u201d he said. Such is the power that Arpaio wields, as a nationally recognized and controversial figure \u2013 who has been the focus of media attention for racial profiling, his hardline stance on illegal immigration, and his continued insistence that Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate is a forgery, and who styles himself \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff\u201d \u2013 that the state legislature passed an anti-bestiality statute the same year. Since then, his officers have been digitally lying in wait for people like Darland \u2013 or like Michael Crawford, a Pennsylvania man who was convicted in January after arranging with undercover detectives to have sexual intercourse with a horse. Arpaio boasted that all of his arrests under the bestiality law he demanded have so far ended in convictions. Moreover, Arpaio has been able to turn Arizona\u2019s new law into a national crusade. Darland, for example, lived in Seattle and had no connection with Arizona until he fell into Arpaio\u2019s online sting operation and got on a plane to Phoenix. Arpaio often quotes \u201cstudies\u201d which he says link bestiality to sexual abuse, though the Guardian was unable to find the original studies, but the issue of animal welfare clearly runs deeper than that for him. \u201cAs a young kid, I would go to school, my dog Pepper \u2013 who lived to 18 years old \u2013 would follow me as I walked to school, wait for me, and then walk back home with me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how can you say that dogs don\u2019t make families happy and people happy?\u201d He has converted one of the jails in his jurisdiction into a shelter for animals rescued by his officers. Darland\u2019s dog Wiley is one, but many others come from animal-hoarders, abusive owners, or puppy-farms. He is also piloting a program which uses the animals as rehabilitative tools for non-violent inmates and prisoners who are veterans. In some of his jails, he told the Guardian, he allows the inmates only to watch the animal-themed movies Lassie Come Home and Old Yeller.  \u201cI\u2019m an animal rights person,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cSomeone has to protect the animals.\u201d Then, he quoted Mahatma Gandhi: \u201cYou judge the morality of a country by the way they treat their animals.\u201d",
