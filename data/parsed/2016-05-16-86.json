  "body": "It is estimated that between 80,000 and 100,000 people are locked in solitary confinement in the United States. They have little or no human contact. The Guardian\u2019s first virtual reality project, 6x9 \u2013 named after the typical dimensions of a solitary confinement cell \u2013 places the viewer in a virtual cell, simulating the psychological effects of sensory deprivation.  Now, for six days in May and June, we are hosting the project as a physical installation. Come and view this powerful virtual reality experience and talk to the people who made it.  Dates: 25 to 27 May and 1 to 3 June  Time: 1pm-8pm Address: The Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU",
