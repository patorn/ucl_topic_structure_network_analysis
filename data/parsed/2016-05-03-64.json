The scientists found that horses\u2019 heart rates were raised and they struggled to chew when nosebands were fitted too tightly around the animals\u2019 heads.    Related: Why the long face? Researchers compile directory of horse facial expressions    The warning comes less than 100 days before the opening of the Rio Olympics which will host three equestrian disciplines. The use of buckled, padded straps, called crank nosebands, is most common in dressage events, where they are used with a double bridle. The researchers say that over-tightening the noseband can be used to mask bad riding technique. A spokesperson from the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale (FEI), the governing body for all Olympic equestrian disciplines, said that there were clear rules on the fitting of nosebands on horses at international events. \u201cFEI stewards officiating at FEI events check all the saddlery, including nosebands and bits, of every horse competing to ensure that the rules are followed. The noseband check includes a physical check by the steward to guarantee that the noseband is fitted properly and is not having an adverse effect on the horse.\u201d But the researchers maintain that they are aware of numerous examples of bands being fitted too tightly, and say there is a need for stricter rules. The noseband is used to make sure that the two metal bars, or \u201cbits\u201d, of the double bridle are kept in the right place in the horse\u2019s mouth, and ensure that the horse cannot put its tongue over them. While it is conventionally recommend that a two-finger sized gap is left beneath the noseband, concerns have been growing that they are often tightened so much they leave no space between the strap and the horse\u2019s nose. Paul McGreevy, a professor of animal behaviour who led the research at the University of Sydney, said the impact of such tight nosebands on horses had not been fully understood. \u201cDenying the animal these fundamental behaviours has to come at a cost and that is what we hadn\u2019t really appreciated,\u201d he said.   Related: Horses can recognise human emotion, new study shows    The trend for ever-tighter nosebands has been fuelled by the rules of dressage, McGreevy said. \u201cThere is a good rule in dressage that if a horse opens its mouth the horse-rider pair will be penalised because that is seen as a sign of rough riding. Of course, it assumes that the horse can open its mouth.\u201d With restrictive equipment, he argues, riders can mask poor horsemanship.  The use of tighter nosebands may also increase discomfort from the bits in the horse\u2019s mouth, making the horse more responsive to commands. \u201cYou might as well have put a sharper or harsher bit in the mouth,\u201d McGreevy said, adding that tight nosebands can also lead to cuts and ulcers where the horses\u2019 cheeks are pushed against their teeth.  Published in the journal Plos One, the study explored the impact of using a double bridle and crank noseband on the behaviour of 12 horses that had not worn the equipment before. Over the course of four days, the scientists monitored how each horse responded to wearing the noseband in four different ways, ranging from tight to completely unfastened.  When no space was left under the noseband, the horses\u2019 heart rates rose significantly, from an average of 34 beats per minute to 46 beats per minute, while eye-temperature measured with an infra-red camera also increased - another sign of stress. When the researchers looked at how often the horses chewed, they found the behaviour became significantly less frequent as the nosebands were tightened beyond conventional levels. The combination of double bridle and noseband also hindered the horses\u2019 ability to lick, swallow and yawn, compared to when the equipment was removed.  McGreevy suggested that nosebands on all horses should be checked using a plastic gadget known as a taper gauge - a move he believes will not only improve the welfare of horses, but improve the sport too. \u201cHorsemanship would ultimately benefit because the people with light hands who are supposed to go to the top of the class in dressage will be recognised,\u201d he said.  David Mountford, of The British Equine Veterinary Association, cautioned that poorly-fitted or inappropriate tack can have a detrimental impact on the welfare of the horse, stressing that all riding equipment should be checked for fit. The competence of the rider is also a key factor when it comes to distress. \u201cAny bridle can cause significant discomfort and stress in the hands of an inexperienced rider,\u201d he warned. \u201cOver reliance on tack is not a substitute for good training.\u201d But Mountford believes more research on ridden horse welfare is needed before clear conclusions can be drawn. \u201cAt the elite/Olympic level of an equestrian sport such as dressage, making the horse uncomfortable would seem to be counterintuitive and unlikely to win medals,\u201d he added.   Related: Olympics row over horse 'cruelty'      The FEI recently removed a guideline that required a two-finger sized gap to be present under the horses\u2019 nosebands, arguing that the measurement was imprecise. The organisation is reluctant to embrace McGreevy\u2019s call for the use of taper gauges. Its spokesperson said: \u201cThrough its own veterinary department, the FEI is constantly monitoring areas of relevant research. The FEI fully respects the research that has gone into developing the taper gauge. However, at competitions when horses - just like human athletes - can be high-strung, it is felt that a physical check is still the safest and most effective method of ensuring that nosebands are fitted correctly.\u201d",
