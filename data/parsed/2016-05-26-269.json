Martin Selmayr, who is chief of staff to the European commission president, Jean Claude Juncker, lumped Johnson in with France\u2019s Marine Le Pen and the US presidential candidate Donald Trump in a provocative tweet.     #G7 2017 with Trump, Le Pen, Boris Johnson, Beppe Grillo? A horror scenario that shows well why it is worth fighting populism. #withJuncker\u2014 Martin Selmayr (@MartinSelmayr) May 26, 2016    The message, in which Selmayr says \u201cit is worth fighting populism\u201d, has already triggered a backlash among out campaigners in Britain. The Vote Leave media spokesman Robert Oxley said of the intervention: \u201cUnelected bureaucrat working for unelected bureaucrat speaks.\u201d There was speculation that Selmayr\u2019s action might have been coordinated as it landed immediately after criticism from Juncker. The commission president accused Johnson of painting an unreal picture of the EU for the British public and said he should return to Brussels, where he previously worked as a journalist, to see whether his claims chimed with \u201creality\u201d.

At the G7 summit in Japan, responding to a question at a press conference about Johnson\u2019s decision to compare the EU\u2019s aims to those of Adolf Hitler, Juncker said: \u201cI\u2019m reading in [the] papers that Boris Johnson spent part of his life in Brussels. It\u2019s time for him to come back to Brussels, in order to check in Brussels if everything he\u2019s telling British people is in line with reality. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, so he would be welcome in Brussels at any time.\u201d Asked whether the European institutions would be able to work with Johnson if he entered Downing Street, Juncker replied: \u201cThe atmosphere of our talks would be better if Britain is staying in the European Union.\u201d Johnson hit back with claims that Germany was the \u201cpaymaster\u201d of an EU project designed to create a United States of Europe.  \u201cI\u2019m afraid what I am saying to the British people is in line with reality and if we vote to remain, which I sincerely hope we don\u2019t, then they will go on with measures that will take us further into a federal European superstate,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cThe whole exercise in Europe is now aimed at propping up the euro. That is the entire mission of the European union. They will try to create a fiscal union, a political union.\u201d He said it all tended towards a mission for a \u201cUnited States of Europe, into which Britain will be sucked\u201d.  Johnson added: \u201cI\u2019m afraid we have not been able to get out from under the obligation for paying for this whole enterprise.\u201d  Donald Tusk, president of the European council, said: \u201cWe have to respect every democratic decision, the result of the referendum and possible political consequences of the referendum. But I think it\u2019s quite normal to have normal relations with politicians and at the same time to have your own opinion about their opinions.\u201d Tusk also tweeted: \u201cG7 needs to be tough in defending common values. Questioned by states outside but also by opponents from within.\u201d Speaking in Ise-Shima before the official opening of the summit, Tusk brought up the refugee crisis, saying Europe had responded to it first because it was the most affected. The geography meant the crisis was the responsibility of Europe first and foremost, he said.  But he called on the international community to show solidarity and recognise that it was a \u201cglobal crisis\u201d. In particular he asked for financial support for the \u201cpublic good\u201d that countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon were doing in helping refugees, and for help with resettling schemes. \u201cEurope is doing a lot and is happy to share its experience,\u201d he said.

He said the issue would be part of any decision on granting China market economy status, something Britain has pushed for but which the steel industry has warned could further damage Britain\u2019s ability to compete. \u201cGlobal overcapacity in the steel sector is of great concern to Europeans. It has cost Europe thousands of jobs since 2008 and the overcapacity in China alone has been estimated at almost double European annual production,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cSo we will make it clear that we will step up our trade defence measures \u2026 Everyone has to know that if somebody distorts the market, Europe cannot be defenceless.\u201d He said overcapacity was not just a problem for the UK, where Tata\u2019s move to sell off British assets has put up to 40,000 jobs at risk.  David Cameron had said he could offer \u201cno guarantees\u201d about the future of the Port Talbot site, which is one of a number under threat, but he promised the government would do \u201ceverything we can\u201d, including raising the issue at the G7.           G7 leaders shovel soil in tree-planting ceremony    The UK prime minister said it would be discussed alongside counter-terrorism strategies in the Middle East, keeping up pressure on Russia over the Minsk agreement, and the dangers facing the world economy. Although Britain\u2019s EU referendum is not on the formal agenda, Cameron said he planned to discuss it on the margins. \u201cBut the G7 and G20 have already made clear that it is a threat to economic growth, a risk to the world economy,\u201d he added. On Thursday morning, he joined other G7 leaders at Japan\u2019s most sacred shrine at Ise Jingu. They were then escorted to the inner Naiku shrine \u2013 an area reserved for Japan\u2019s most distinguished visitors. After a cleansing ceremony with holy water, Cameron planted a Japanese cedar tree with the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, using shovels handed to them by schoolchildren from the Mie prefecture. They then started with working sessions that stretched over lunch, followed by side events on Europe, trade, and counter-terrorism.",
