  "body": "The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has confirmed he knew the Australian Federal Police were investigating leaks from within NBN Co but said he did not tell the prime minister. Fifield said on Saturday he had no interaction with the AFP regarding the investigation, including over Thursday\u2019s night\u2019s raids on properties linked to Senator Stephen Conroy and the Labor staffer Andrew Byrne. \u201cThe referral to the AFP was made by NBN senior management. I did not instruct nor request them to do so,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday.   Related: Labor anger after NBN employee spread raid photos before files were sealed    \u201cAs an AFP investigation was under way I did not advise other ministers or the prime minister of this matter.\u201d The police referral came after an internal NBN Co review identified \u201cmatters of concern\u201d, he said. Fifield\u2019s statement on Saturday appeared to conflict with statements by the AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, who told reporters on Friday that no one in the communications minister\u2019s office had been aware of the investigation before Thursday\u2019s raids. A report in the Australian newspaper on Saturday said Fifield and the NBN chief executive, Bill Morrow, had kept in contact about the government-owned broadband company\u2019s internal efforts to track down the leaker of the documents, and as those efforts proved fruitless, Morrow made clear he was considering referring the case to the AFP. Labor has effectively accused the government of involvement in NBN Co\u2019s decision to call in the AFP resulting in the raids \u2013 a claim denied by Fifield and the company. Bill Shorten said on Saturday that it was \u201ctotally implausible\u201d Fifield would not have told Turnbull or his staff of the investigation. Labor Senator Penny Wong too said it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d the prime minister\u2019s office was not informed. Malcolm Turnbull, speaking at a campaign stop on the New South Wales central coast on Saturday, said it was \u201centirely appropriate\u201d that Fifield never told him of the police investigation. \u201cThat is a matter of judgment for him,\u201d he said. The AFP began the investigation on 9 December after months of damaging leaks from within NBN Co that exposed cost blowouts and delays in the rollout of the network, over which Turnbull had carriage as communications minister until September 2015.   Related: Australian federal police raid Labor senator's office over alleged NBN leaks    It was revealed on Friday that an NBN Co representative \u2013 deputised to be present during Thursday\u2019s raid of Conroy\u2019s office \u2013 took and disseminated photographs of around 32 documents, possibly including Labor\u2019s broadband policy.  NBN Co has since agreed to destroy its copies of the photographs, which Labor says show documents covered by parliamentary privilege. The images are to be sealed and stored by the clerk of the Senate, probably until parliament resumes after the election campaign. NBN Co released a statement saying it had complied \u201cat all times\u201d with instructions from the AFP, which had been investigating an \u201congoing theft of intellectual property\u201d reported by the company in December 2015.  Turnbull said the privileged documents were \u201cclearly stolen from NBN Co\u201d and that Conroy had been \u201ctrying to keep police away from [them]\u201d. But Shorten said the contents of the documents had been published by several news outlets and were publicly available. Colvin said on Friday there had been no political interference in the police investigation, including in the timing of Thursday\u2019s raids. \u201cThere has been no influence, no influence on the AFP in the conduct of this investigation,\u201d he said.",
