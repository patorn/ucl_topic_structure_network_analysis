  "body": "The prison wing erupted with joy. People were shouting and cheering and banging heavy objects against their cell doors. It was like everyone\u2019s favourite football team had scored at once. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d my cellmate asked excitedly. \u201cRupert Murdoch just took a hit to the face!\u201d Comedian and activist Jonnie Marbles had managed to sneak a shaving-foam \u201ccustard pie\u201d into the July 2011 committee hearing about phone hacking, which he launched at the octogenarian media mogul on behalf, he later explained, of \u201call the people who couldn\u2019t\u201d. Few anticipated that, within weeks, he would be joining us behind bars. When I was sentenced to 16 months in prison for violent disorder during an anti-tuition fee protest in 2010, the sarcastic round of applause that greeted me afterwards should have hinted at the sorts of difficulties I was going to face. It wasn\u2019t inmates who were doing the jeering; they mostly seemed as sad and subdued as me. Rather, it was people in uniforms, with keys, power and, now, total control over my life, who seemed to bear a grudge.    We were like: shall we go to the Tate Modern, or should we attempt to get into parliament where I will pie Murdoch?    Prison was a leap into the dark. Having gone almost without pause from the university exam hall to court, there hadn\u2019t been much time for thinking about what life might be like inside. With only Hollywood to go on, I imagined the worst: mentally, I had prepared myself for a long, bloody war against sexual assailants. At 21, I was one of the youngest inmates in HMP Wandsworth. Thankfully, the only instinct I seemed to arouse in other prisoners was a paternal one. \u201cI\u2019ve got a son about your age,\u201d explained one old-timer who came by on my first day to make sure everything was OK. My conviction inspired a strange sort of respect. Officers had a very different approach. During a rare moment out of my cell, two accosted me on the wing and roughly patted me down for \u201ccontraband\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Gilmour,\u201d one said threateningly, \u201cwe can do rectal searches, too. Any time we like.\u201d Conditions in HMP Wandsworth were shocking. The prison was swimming in drugs and swarming with rats. For up to 23 hours a day, inmates \u2013 many guilty of little more than bad luck \u2013 were doubled up in filthy cells designed to hold one. (The situation has since got worse; in the last year, three Wandsworth inmates killed themselves.) Experiencing the senselessness of incarceration first hand was depressing and infuriating, but I also found it politically affirming. Prison is society\u2019s failure writ large in bricks, mortar and razor wire.     Charlie Gilmour swings from a flag on the side of the Cenotaph during a 2010 student fees protest. Photograph: Ki Price    When I wrote to a newspaper hinting at some of the corruption and abuse I had observed, a senior officer went out of his way to pay a personal visit to my cell. He had the unsent letter in his hand. Life, I was told, could be made \u201cvery difficult\u201d if I went down that path. With the thought of daily body searches \u2013 and goodness knows what else \u2013 I decided to bide my time. As an experience, prison seemed almost tailor-made to make anyone with a social conscience want to fight against it. I couldn\u2019t help but feel quashed into silence; since being released in 2011, however, I\u2019ve spoken out about reform. Recent research conducted by Dr David Bailey at the University of Birmingham has revealed that there have been more protest events in Britain since 2008 than at any point since the 1970s. Many of those involved have subsequently gone to prison. From the series of high-profile trials that came in the wake of the student protests of 2010-11 and the anti-cuts protests of 2011, to more idiosyncratic cases such as that of Marbles, the state has used the law to stifle dissent. But what happens when you send an activist to prison? Does it break them, or strengthen their resolve?     Jonnie Marbles: \u2018I thought it would be very silly, a bit funny, a bit of an adventure.\u2019 Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Marbles, now 31, still seems slightly shell-shocked by the whole Murdoch affair. \u201cI just assumed that, once I\u2019d been successful, there was going to be a ticker-tape parade,\u201d he says, staring into his pint of cider in a London pub and wearing a grubby cartoon print T-shirt. \u201cIt turned out to be quite the opposite.\u201d Despite being a seasoned activist \u2013 Marbles was a founding member of UK Uncut and had spent the previous two years \u201cliving in squats and in the anarchist community\u201d \u2013 the attack on Murdoch was not well-planned. \u201cMy partner and I at the time were like, we should do something tomorrow. Shall we go to the Tate Modern, or should we attempt to get into parliament, where I will pie Rupert Murdoch? We sort of edged towards the second one. I thought it would be very silly, a bit funny, a bit of an adventure. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d actually manage to pull it off.\u201d But he did. Marbles recalls looking on in horror as, one by one, the people between him and Murdoch got up and left until, finally, his path was clear. He sent one final tweet: \u201cIt is a far better thing that I do now than I have ever done before #splat.\u201d \u201cI had the most intense adrenaline rush of my life,\u201d he says now. \u201cI tried to think of an amazing, for-the-history-books kind of thing to say and it came out as something like, \u2018You naughty billionaire.\u2019 It was awful.\u201d  Marbles\u2019 surprise intervention resulted in his immediate arrest, attacks in the media (\u201cUnfunny comic makes Rupert Murdoch look like a victim,\u201d The Mirror said) and, eventually, a six-week prison sentence for assault. \u201cThere\u2019s a proverb I wish I\u2019d known before,\u201d Marbles tells me. \u201cNever start a war with a man who buys ink by the barrel. I was not prepared for the response. It hurt.\u201d     Jonnie Marbles aims his \u2018pie\u2019 at Rupert Murdoch, July 2011. Photograph: PA    In Wandsworth prison, he was treated like a minor celebrity. Fellow inmates, he says, had him signing copies of the Sun. Letters of support flooded in. \u201cEven prison officers thought it was ridiculous that I\u2019d been sent to jail.\u201d They became less sympathetic when they discovered he was somehow publishing a blog about life inside. \u201cThey smashed into my cell and started tearing everything apart,\u201d he says. \u201cThey made me kneel down while they were ripping things off the wall, throwing stuff around: \u2018We know you\u2019ve got a phone, we know you\u2019ve got a phone!\u2019 Eventually, I decided to tell them about these things called letters.\u201d Marbles had been sending his blogposts through the prison mail system, to be typed up by a friend. After just two weeks and a successful appeal, Marbles was set free. At first, he felt the experience had left him unscathed and ready for more action; among his political friends, he found he had a new status. \u201cI think it shows the courage of your convictions if you can go to prison and keep being an activist,\u201d he explains. But a month after his release, he travelled to Dale Farm, to help the local traveller community resist eviction. The police response, which saw activists shot with Tasers, was, Marbles says, \u201cscarier than prison\u201d, and the two experiences combined left him with \u201csome sort of PTSD\u201d. After that, he burnt out. Having been on the receiving end of state violence twice in a row, he found himself questioning the power of activism itself. \u201cI felt very alienated from my fellow activists,\u201d he says. \u201cThat feeling of \u2018activism is fun\u2019 was gone. It was like we\u2019d all been playing paintball and I just found out the other team had real guns.\u201d     Chelsea Stafford: \u2018The first night, I had a panic attack. I was crying.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    For 20-year-old Chelsea Stafford, the experience of prison made her \u201chate the government even more\u201d, which is remarkable when you consider that a year ago she could barely name anyone in it. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the slightest clue,\u201d Stafford says. \u201cI was one of those people who just turned off and didn\u2019t really listen to anything.\u201d Having moved to Liverpool from Suffolk, Stafford was drifting through life. After finding her partner in bed with another woman, she began drinking heavily and, by her own account, was going off the rails. But all that changed when, in April 2015, she saw on Facebook that a group calling themselves the Love Activists had occupied the former Bank of England building in Liverpool city centre with the intention of turning it into a community homeless shelter. Moving out of her home and into the bank led to a political awakening. \u201cI started learning about all the cuts, because people were coming in saying the local hostel didn\u2019t have any room for them and there was no mental-health services, no drug services \u2013 people couldn\u2019t get help,\u201d Stafford says. \u201cI was quite shocked, because I had no idea this was going on.\u201d Despite much local support \u2013 the group\u2019s \u201cfree shop\u201d for the homeless was, Stafford says, overflowing with donations \u2013 the Love Activists were soon served with an eviction order. They decided to resist and, a fortnight later, 130 police officers swarmed the building. \u201cIt was half-six in the morning so we were asleep,\u201d Stafford recalls. \u201cThen we heard the chainsaw. They had forensics; they had sniffer dogs; they had everything. There were just five of us.\u201d She was eventually sentenced to 10 weeks in prison for trespass. The injustice of it still rankles: \u201cA paedophile got community service the day we were being sent down for helping the homeless.\u201d The Love Bank 5, as they became known, had passionate supporters. \u201cOur mates raided the prison van and started banging on the windows shouting, \u2018Free the Five!\u2019\u201d Stafford says. \u201cA couple lay down in front of the van and wouldn\u2019t let it move. I started crying with happiness after that. It was overwhelming.\u201d She ended up being \u201cstarved\u201d in HMP Styal, however. \u201cI asked over and over for a vegan meal,\u201d Stafford tells me. \u201cThey were trying to get me to eat meat. The girls would all put chips off their plate on to mine and try to feed me up, but obviously you can\u2019t get any nutrition off that. I was trying to drink tea to fill my belly, but that was just making me throw up.\u201d Within her first two days, Stafford broke down. \u201cThe first night, I had a panic attack. I was crying. I couldn\u2019t breathe. The second night, I self-harmed.\u201d After biting off the end of a hairgrip, Stafford attacked her own legs until they were covered in blood \u2013 something she hadn\u2019t done since she was 16.  She found the experience of being in a strange place, and surrounded by people she didn\u2019t know, deeply unsettling. Only letters kept her going. \u201cI got messages from people all around the country offering support and sending stamps and money,\u201d Stafford says. \u201cIt really boosted my spirits.\u201d After a week, she was released on appeal, and immediately started calling for the release of the remaining four. \u201cPrisons aren\u2019t constructive,\u201d Stafford says. \u201cYou don\u2019t get anything from sending someone there. It just makes people want to fight back.\u201d *** Even from within prison, there are opportunities for protest, although they often seem more like acts of desperation. Vhinda (not his real name), a self-employed construction worker in his 30s who spent just under a year behind bars for a public order offence after an anti-fascist protest turned violent, remembers one such incident during his first week inside Wormwood Scrubs. \u201cAs a protest, an inmate decided to jump off the landing on to one of those metal safety nets,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he thought he was going to bounce. He didn\u2019t.\u201d Vhinda decided he had to use his time to aid his fellow prisoners in whatever small ways he could. He helped people write letters to their mothers and complaints to the governor; he shared his library of anarchist literature with anyone who expressed an interest; and he volunteered as a Samaritans\u2019 peer supporter. \u201cThe state wants you to feel alienated and divided,\u201d Vhinda explains. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to support your fellow people.\u201d    I was getting 10 to 20 letters a day. I\u2019ve kept every single letter that was ever sent to me    After two inmate suicides \u2013 one of which Vhinda felt was caused by a prison officer telling an inmate he was going to die in prison \u2013 he decided to stage an esoteric protest of his own. In one of the prison\u2019s workshops, he turned a paving slab into a tombstone and buried it in the ground. Feeling something was missing, he made a tiny wreath of weeds to balance above the inscription: \u201cRIP HMP.\u201d \u201cIt was a statement,\u201d Vhinda says. \u201cThe prison system is a graveyard for the poor. But it was also something I wanted to see: the death of the prison system as we have it now. It didn\u2019t quite have the desired effect.\u201d For this, and other minor acts of mischief, he fluffed whatever chance he had at getting time off for good behaviour. Though, as an activist, he was not forgotten by the outside world, unlike many other inmates. \u201cFight Racism! Fight Imperialism! sent me their newspapers to read, people sent magazines that they\u2019d produced, others sent their sociology theses,\u201d he says. \u201cSome days, I didn\u2019t even leave my cell \u2013 [I was] just reading stuff. Over the Christmas period, I was getting 10 to 20 letters a day. It was the little things, a statement at the end of the letter like, \u2018You\u2019re in there for us. We\u2019re out here for you.\u2019 And they were. Without a doubt they were. I\u2019ve kept every single letter that was ever sent to me.\u201d  Whether or not he is still involved in direct action today, Vhinda will not say. But he tells me: \u201cThe flame has not been extinguished. Anti-fascism is a moral duty, not a crime.\u201d     Nick Emley: \u2018You mustn\u2019t let prison get you down. You have to overcome it.\u2019 Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    As Nick Emley, 65, potters into a west London gastro pub with his little dog Porty in tow, I wonder if it might be time of the more conventional sort that kills the rebellious instinct. Once, Emley was a borstal boy. After allegedly punching a policeman during the Garden House Riot of 1970, at which a Cambridge hotel hosting an event promoting holidays to military dictatorship-era Greece was torn apart, he spent six months and three weeks in the notoriously brutal youth-detention system. Today, however, he is a semi-retired wine buyer and is commending the pub\u2019s pappardelle. \u201cI believe in non-violent demonstrations now,\u201d Emley says. \u201cI take a Gandhi-ist position.\u201d Not so in 1970. \u201cPunching that policeman was accidental,\u201d he says, \u201cbut things happened in the Garden. I remember ripping up a little ornate lamp-post, pulling it out of the ground and hurling it towards the windows. It was exciting and it got a little bit out of control.\u201d While protest and politics were all very new for Emley, who was just 18 at the time, borstal felt like more of the same. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been sent away to school at the age of eight, you get used to loneliness and missing your mother and father and having dreadful prefects that beat you and masters that beat you. I never cried at all in borstal.\u201d On his release, he returned to Cambridge University to complete his degree in modern languages. He was greeted like a hero. \u201cThe first night back, when I came to hall, all the undergraduates and graduates and teachers got up to applaud me,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt terrific. I stood up on the table. I was very moved.\u201d Emley didn\u2019t exactly go on to join the Angry Brigade, but his path veered sharply away from the one his Tory-voting parents had hoped he might take. He started teaching at a state school in London, joined his union and voted Labour. He eventually went on to co-found the homelessness charity StreetSmart. \u201cMy view is that you mustn\u2019t let prison get you down,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to overcome it. You have to be bigger than it. You cannot let it break you, because when you are broken, you are finished. It made me determined. If my children were involved in something like this today, then I would be proud of them.\u201d *** Outside Willesden magistrates court in London, where a huge crowd has assembled to support the Heathrow 13 \u2013 another group of activists threatened with incarceration after they blocked the north runaway to protest climate change \u2013 I reflect on my own experiences. Prison wasn\u2019t exactly a cakewalk, but it\u2019s clear that activists and protesters can enjoy a privileged status within the system. After I was sentenced, letters and cards from the great and the good jammed up the mail. It started to get a bit silly: my cellmate could hardly believe it when a copy of Crime And Punishment arrived with a personal note from a total stranger called Elton John. A high-profile trial can be a double-edged sword: some officers, who didn\u2019t feel I was being punished enough, had their fun trashing my cell while I was away from the wing; others tried to get violent prisoners to beat me up, without success. Inside, those seen to have fought the system are often considered heroes rather than villains. If anything, the experience has hardened my beliefs. I want to highlight the problems of the prison system, to push back. There\u2019s a line I like in anthropologist and activist Professor David Graeber\u2019s book Direct Action: \u201cWhen completely under the power of the state, one would seem to encounter both its brutality, and its stupidity, in unadulterated form.\u201d Through the crowd in London, I spot a seemingly revitalised Jonnie Marbles, chanting and raising his fist. He flashes me a grin. So prison didn\u2019t work for him, then? He disagrees: \u201cIt worked perfectly; it has driven me further towards social justice.\u201d",
