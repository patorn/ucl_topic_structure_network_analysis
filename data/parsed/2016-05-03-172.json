  "body": "There was an initial shudder of shyness through the young audience, and then the questions fired like pinballs. First-time voters at Rosshall academy in Glasgow intelligently questioned the assembled politicians on a spectrum of subjects from the Curriculum for Excellence to the migrant crisis, and listened to their answers respectfully, though not uncritically.  These are some of the 16- and 17-year-olds across Scotland will go to the polls for the first time in a parliamentary election on Thursday. The hustings, exactly a week before the poll, were ably chaired by a local Scottish youth parliament representative, Aqeel Ahmed, who had persuaded all the Glasgow Pollok constituency candidates to attend, including the SNP\u2019s Europe minister, Humza Yousaf, and ex-Labour leader Johann Lamont. As the event wound up, and a notably modest number of selfies were requested, the consensus was positive but with one caveat. As 17-year-old Victoria Paul put it: \u201cIt was really good but there is one major disadvantage: that they are all playing to the audience as young people.\u201d Her friend Karen McSporran, also 17, explained: \u201cThey\u2019re just saying the things they think you\u2019re interested in, like tuition fees, when you want to know about things that will affect you in the future, like taxation.\u201d Gemma McKinlay, 16, was succinct: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to engage young people in politics as though we\u2019re not already engaged.\u201d After the SNP\u2019s audacious and hugely successful move to include 16- and 17-year-olds in the Scottish independence referendum of 2014, Holyrood MSPs voted unanimously last year to extend the franchise in Scottish elections \u2013 as it happened on the same day that Tory MPs in Westminster struck down an amendment to give the vote to under-18s in the forthcoming EU referendum.

Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    While the numbers themselves may not be electorally significant \u2013 there are about 120,000 16- and 17-year-olds living in Scotland \u2013 it remains a radical shift. \u201cIt\u2019s a groundbreaking moment in Scottish politics,\u201d said Jenni Gunn, an organiser for Generation Yes in 2014 and now \u2013 aged 25 \u2013 a candidate for the new leftwing alliance Rise. \u201cDuring the referendum, young people energised the campaign in a way that no other demographic did.\u201d But Gunn was concerned that extending the franchise in isolation was not enough: \u201cThe political elite pay lip service to the youth vote without making any effort to change things: it\u2019s that condescending attitude of \u2018we\u2019ve given you the vote, now off you go\u2019. But there has to be a more concerted effort to offer political education in schools, and to have young people\u2019s voice heard in policymaking.\u201d It\u2019s a worry shared by the Scottish Greens candidate Ross Greer, who if his party\u2019s recent poll surge holds until Thursday will become the youngest MSP in the history of the Scottish parliament at the age of 21. \u201cIt\u2019s not been as big a deal in this election as in the referendum, when there was a huge focus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become pretty blase.\u201d While the Electoral Commission says that 79% of secondary schools in Scotland ran online registration events as part if its #ReadyToVote campaign, Greer said most events had not extended beyond the mechanics of voting. \u201cThere\u2019s been less effort made to have hustings in schools, less general awareness encouraging young people to register to vote. Young people are not being engaged with like they were in the referendum. This is the first time they\u2019ve voted in an election and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve cracked it this time.\u201d Greer, who was part of the successful campaign to give 16- and 17-year-olds the vote in the independence referendum, naturally promotes his own party\u2019s solution to make core political education a part of PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education).     Aqeel Ahmed, a member of the Scottish youth parliament, chairs the meeting. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    While the new voters at Rosshall were too young to cast their ballot on independence, they all agreed that the referendum was what awakened their political interest. \u201cSo many of the rallies were family-friendly,\u201d said Emma Reavey, 16, \u201cso we all went along together.\u201d They said they were less likely to agree with their parents\u2019 politics as they found out more for themselves, but also accepted that they were able to do so thanks to Rosshall\u2019s active Mods (modern studies) department. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about politics much to people out of school,\u201d admitted Emma. To find out about party policies, these young people go straight to source. As Gemma said: \u201cI\u2019d go directly to the manifestos because the media can twist things.\u201d They are equally canny about parties\u2019 online overtures. \u201cI think social media gives certain politicians a big advantage,\u201d warned Emma, \u201cbecause for example Humza Yousaf is really good [at using social media] and other people just aren\u2019t.\u201d And there is an ongoing frustration with adult assumptions about young people\u2019s voting behaviour. This was never more evident than during the last referendum campaign, when commentators suggested that extending the franchise was a smart move on Alex Salmond\u2019s part because young people would inevitably be more attracted to a yes vote. In fact, there was only a slim majority among their age-group in favour of independence.     Thomas Haddow (Conservative), Johann Lamont (Labour), Isabel Nelson (Lib Dem), Aqeel Ahmed, Zara Kitson (Green) and Humza Yousaf (SNP). Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    As Victoria put it: \u201cI don\u2019t like reputation that young people get that they will just vote for what their friends do and they don\u2019t really have a clue.\u201d Emma said: \u201cThere\u2019s still a stigma that young people aren\u2019t interested in politics but older people can know a lot less.\u201d Karen recently had to explain the Scottish parliament\u2019s two-ballot voting system to her own mum. The independence referendum proved the interest is there: an Electoral Commission survey immediately after the September 2014 vote found that 75% of 16- and 17-year-olds said they had voted. At Edinburgh University\u2019s school of social and political science, Jan Eichhorn is responsible for the most comprehensive study to date of young people\u2019s voting behaviour since the referendum.  He found that there was indeed a positive effect from the referendum on participation in the 2015 general election \u2013 the younger age group still participated less than average, but much more than in the past and more than their counterparts in England. In particular the youngest \u2013 18- and 19-year-olds \u2013 were more likely to take part than the next oldest, suggesting a particularly strong effect for the newly enfranchised. For Eichhorn, the question is: how long will this last? In contrast to Gunn and Greer, he suggested that the diminution in the focus on young people may be a positive. \u201cIn Scotland we have a slight majority of people saying 16-year-olds should vote in all elections, which is not the case in the rest of the UK. That blaseness [about young people voting] means that it has become more accepted.\u201d     Rosshall students. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    But political education is not confined to the classroom. Louise Macdonald, CEO of Young Scot, the national citizenship organisation, argued that plenty of young people were politically educating each other, whether that meant encouraging one another online to register to vote, or choosing the speakers at TEDxGlasgow.    Related: Everything you need to know about the Holyrood elections    \u201cEngagement has moved beyond student politics on campus and it\u2019s much easier for young people to see young activists, and not just in party politics,\u201d she said. There was still an excitement about voting for the first time among her members, she said, and the challenge now was for politicians to build on that. \u201cWith the independence referendum the broadness of that question allowed young people to have conversations about issues: with an election it\u2019s a spectrum rather than polar opposites. We\u2019ve seen parties upping their game on social media, but this election is the first test of how the parties and other organisations involved have adapted themselves.\u201d",
