  "body": "Today\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook Chester is one of those courses, along with Goodwood, where I habitually look at jockey statistics. As you\u2019ll be aware, it\u2019s a tricky place to ride and I think confidence becomes an issue for some people. If you\u2019re asked to do something difficult that you have failed to do dozens of times before and hardly ever got right, you\u2019re not going to approach the task with much positivity, are you?   Related: Horse racing tips: Friday 6 May    So it was surprising and the cause of mild concern yesterday morning to see that Silvestre De Sousa had only had one previous winner at Chester in the previous four years, which is most of his British career. Admittedly, he\u2019d only had 16 rides there. A few hours after I\u2019d noticed that, De Sousa won twice from three rides at Chester, proving once more that he is an excellent jockey who, given half-decent opportunities, can make the most of them. Opportunity is key, of course. I think he\u2019s got another big chance back there today on Fingal\u2019s Cave (4.20), from the in-form Mick Channon yard for which De Sousa has a 19% strike-rate this year. This four-year-old did little last year and was off from June to February but seems to have come back in excellent heart, improving for his reappearance to win two of his last three. He takes a keen grip, which was his undoing behind a steady pace at Chelmsford in March, but there should be plenty of pace on here and De Sousa is pretty useful at settling a horse behind the leaders. Trap seven is not bad for that purpose and there\u2019s a significant cutaway inside the two-furlong marker today that should help everyone get a run when they need it. Fingal\u2019s Cave is 6-1. You can get 13-2 about Trendsetter (5.20) in the apprentice handicap, he having achieved his only success of last year here. He comes from the John Quinn yard that is going strongly just now and has a useful 7lb taken off by George Wood, who is very hot after his 20-1 success on 2,000 Guineas day. At Ascot\u2019s fine card tonight, Cartmell Cleave (7.05) is interesting at 6-1 in a sprint handicap. Fast ground is right up his alley and he won on his reappearance last year. He kept on improving and this mark is no obstacle, judging by how well he ran despite trouble in running here in September. Tipping competition, day four (and final) Our winners so far: Tuesday Ice Slice 5-2 Rebeccas Choice 16-1 Gone Too Far 11-4 Wednesday No Heretic 11-1 Kimberella 5-1 Supersta 6-1 Thursday Ian Fleming 9-1 Justice Angel 11-2 Newera 5-1 And our leader is: Mai11 +27.50 \u2026 who keeps on finding winners, spying Ian Fleming yesterday.
