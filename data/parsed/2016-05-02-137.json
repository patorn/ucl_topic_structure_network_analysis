  "body": "Can a performance go viral? Ben Platt\u2019s should. As the title character in Dear Evan Hansen, the new musical from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, he offers acting so precise yet so painfully lucid that it should overwhelm the operating systems by which most contemporary musicals operate.  Platt\u2019s gestures, his expressions, his phrasing, even his vocal range \u2013 which is impressive but tends to thin out toward the top notes \u2013 all combine to communicate the fretfulness, uncertainty and timorous goodness that define his character.  He plays Evan, a friendless high school senior terrified of life, the universe, everything. Speaking up scares him so much that he would rather go hungry than exchange chitchat with a pizza deliveryman. His harried single mother, Heidi, (Rachel Bay Jones) tells him, \u201cYou can\u2019t succeed if you never try.\u201d Evan nods, but you can that he believes more strongly in the corollary: \u201cIf you don\u2019t try, you can\u2019t fail.\u201d  A therapist has instructed him to write pep-talk letters to himself. On the first day of school, one of them falls into the hands of Connor Murphy (Mike Faist), another outcast with drug problems and a look a peer describes as \u201cschool shooter chic\u201d. When Connor kills himself, his parents find the letter and mistakenly believe that Evan was a friend to their son. At first this attention panics Evan, but he soon accepts the role and even briefly becomes an internet sensation. Often he is tempted to tell Connor\u2019s family the truth, but he fears disappointing them and sacrificing his newfound confidence.   Watching Dear Evan Hansen, one often thinks of Next to Normal, another Second Stage show about a mentally distressed protagonist (it was bipolar disorder there, anxiety disorder here). The shows share a director, Michael Greif, and a similarly slick design. But with its tuneful pop score and teenage protagonist, Dear Evan Hansen is a gentler affair, even as it takes occasional pains not to oversentimentalize the material. When Evan presents a surprisingly rosy picture of her brother, his sister Zoe (Laura Dreyfuss) sings, \u201cDon\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t true/ That you were not the monster/ That I knew.\u201d  Yes, the emotional core can still turn occasionally gooey, and the critiques of internet culture, courtesy of Steven Levenson\u2019s mostly shrewd and clever book, are not exactly subtle, especially as realized in Peter Nigrini\u2019s projection design. But it\u2019s impossible not to care deeply for these characters, Platt\u2019s Evan most of all.  Near the play\u2019s end, Platt positively glistens with sweat and spit and tears. Yet one never has the sense of an actor deliberately winding himself up to deliver a visceral performance. There\u2019s obvious care taken in the way he offers Evan\u2019s cringing smile, his swallowed laugh, his habit of pulling at his clothes as though searching for someone to hold onto. But all of these details feel lived, organic, unrehearsed. And Platt\u2019s ability to convey emotion through song is simply superb and often deeply heartrending. A Facebook like is the least the man deserves.",
