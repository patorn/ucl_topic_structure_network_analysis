  "body": "With its sentimental depiction of the relationship between a wealthy white woman and a nobly subservient black man, if there\u2019s one film that hasn\u2019t aged well, it\u2019s Driving Miss Daisy \u2013 and indeed there were plenty of people who excoriated its racial politics on its release in 1989, Public Enemy giving it a memorable shout-out on the self-explanatory Burn Hollywood Burn. Now, displaying either a brass-balled disregard for his critics or a mulish inability to understand their complaints, the movie\u2019s Australian director Bruce Beresford has made another film in which a saintly black servant teaches the white folks how to live.          Watch the trailer for Mr Church    In his first film role for four years, Eddie Murphy plays Mr Church with quiet dignity on full blast but his crackling charisma turned down to zero. Mr Church is a cook who\u2019s been appointed to look after Marie, played by Natascha McElhone, and her 10-year-old daughter Charlotte (Natalie Coughlin), by Marie\u2019s deceased, rich former lover. The bratty Charlotte throws a tantrum, demanding Apple Jacks cereal rather than Mr Church\u2019s extravagant steak, eggs and grits (for breakfast \u2013 the fact that the characters aren\u2019t all built like the Michelin man being one of the film\u2019s unrealistic elements), but is soon won over by both Mr Church\u2019s cooking and his collection of literary classics, which he lends to her from his personal library.    Related: How to fix Hollywood's race problem    Marie is suffering from breast cancer, but outlives her diagnosis by several years, long enough to see her daughter \u2013 now a less objectionable teenager played by Britt Robertson \u2013 get taken to her first prom. By this time Mr Church is part of the family unit, though he\u2019s still waiting on the pair hand and foot from morning until night and calling Marie \u201cma\u2019am\u201d. What he does in his extracurricular time becomes an object of fascination for Charlotte, especially since Mr Church won\u2019t tell. Sadly for the viewers, by night Mr Church doesn\u2019t turn out to be a cat burglar, habitue of S&M sex dungeons or \u2013 better still \u2013 a revolutionary plotting to bring about the violent downfall of white America. Instead he just enjoys going to Jellys, a supposedly seedy jazz club, and having a skinful \u2013 and with such a lack of agency in the rest of his life, no wonder. Set in the 70s, Mr Church mercilessly trades in cliches \u2013 for instance, Charlotte\u2019s former schoolfriend turns into a rich-bitch fashion designer, her extravagant lifestyle failing to make up for the fact that she can\u2019t have children. There\u2019s also a fairytale subplot involving the salvation of the local drunk. Yet it\u2019s the film\u2019s racial politics, particularly its stereotypical evocation of willing servitude by an African-American, and its characters\u2019 refusal to acknowledge this imbalance of power, which make it not so much old-fashioned as downright retrograde \u2013 and likely to go down even worse with black audiences than Driving Miss Daisy.",
