  "body": "The leader of Plaid Cymru has vowed to make life uncomfortable for the new Labour-led minority government in Wales, and said she expects the administration to work with her party to get its budget and bills through. Although Plaid made a deal allowing the Welsh Labour leader, Carwyn Jones, to be reappointed as first minister, Wood told the Guardian there would be no cosy relationship between the parties.  \u201cI feel I\u2019ve been given a mandate to shake things up a bit and to try to bring about the change Wales needs. I stood on a platform of change. Business as usual in the fifth assembly term is not an option,\u201d she said. \u201cAllowing\u201d Jones to become first minister was a one-off, Wood added. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a vote of support for the government. It wasn\u2019t an endorsement for their first minister. We will hold them to account.  \u201cLabour as a minority government has to deal with another party. I can\u2019t see how they can go to the Tories or Ukip for support. We would give them some serious flak over that. They have to deal with us or they can\u2019t get their budget or legislation through. We intend to use the position we are in to maximise our leverage and get as many of our policies from our manifesto through as possible.\u201d     Wood with supporters after this month\u2019s Welsh assembly elections. Photograph: Tracey Paddison/Rex/Shutterstock    Labour remained by far the biggest party in Wales following this month\u2019s elections but fell just short of an overall majority, winning 29 of the 60 seats. Plaid was next with 12, and the Tories took 11, while Ukip won seats for the first time, securing seven. The Lib Dems plunged from five to one. Labour began to plan a minority government until Plaid unexpectedly put forward Wood to challenge Jones for the post of first minister. Spotting the chance to give Labour a bloody nose, Ukip and the Tories \u2013 Plaid\u2019s natural enemies \u2013 backed Wood. Had the sole Liberal Democrat AM supported her, the Plaid leader would have been first minister.  Speaking in her corner office overlooking the assembly and Cardiff Bay, Wood smiled broadly at the idea. \u201cI recognise that running a government in those circumstances would have been very very difficult, but I would have given it a go,\u201d she said. \u201cI would have sought to try to win the support of some of those Labour members who I know agree with the bulk of our programme. I think we could have put something together.  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about legislation, You can run a government without passing legislation. The main thing is getting the budget through but you do hold a huge amount of executive power. The opportunities for using that executive power would have been there.\u201d  But that wasn\u2019t the idea of the nomination. \u201cThe purpose was to demonstrate Labour couldn\u2019t automatically rely on Plaid Cymru\u2019s support. They had to come to the table in the spirit of equality. I think we sent that message to them loud and clear.\u201d  Labour did come to the table and the parties hatched a deal, which they called, rather clunkily, A Compact to Move Wales Forward.  There is no coalition but Plaid will sit with Labour on three new liaison committees that will examine finance, legislation and the constitution. Key Plaid election pledges on health, apprenticeships and childcare, some of which overlapped with Labour\u2019s, will be prioritised. The parties will also work together to tackle the steel crisis in Port Talbot, and campaign to remain in the EU. The deal done, Wood\u2019s nomination for the job of first minister was withdrawn and Carwyn Jones was re-elected. Jones\u2019s tone was conciliatory, promising to work with other parties.     We have no doubt about the responsibilities on us, and the responsibility upon me in particular, to work with others\u2014 Carwyn Jones (@fmwales) May 18, 2016    Afterwards, Wood made what she described as a \u201cfierce\u201d speech in which she attacked the new Labour government in Wales as arrogant, complacent and bullying.  Reflecting on that speech, she said: \u201cI was trying to send a signal about the way in which we intend to operate as an opposition. I wanted to create a tone which said to the country and the government that whatever is good for Wales we will do. But that doesn\u2019t mean we will automatically support this minority Labour government. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in power for 17 years. They have run out of ideas, their manifesto was shockingly thin, they have nothing to offer this country, which needs transformation, change. I think it was really important the government understood the terms under which we are engaging.\u201d Wood has long been seen as a firebrand. A former probation officer from the Rhondda Valley in south Wales, she was once expelled from the assembly for referring to the Queen as Mrs Windsor. She is no fan of the royal family.

Photograph: ITV/Getty Images Europe    She was a star of the UK general election campaign in 2015, taking on the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, during a televised leaders\u2019 debate. But her speech this week may be the start of a new, even fiercer chapter.  Her own standing, and perhaps her confidence, was bolstered on election night this month when she won the constituency seat in the Rhondda, a Labour heartland.  \u201cIt\u2019s a great honour to be elected by people who you have grown up with and live amongst. The reason I wanted to stand in a constituency seat was to lead from the front. We recognise that to become the biggest party in the assembly we have to make a breakthrough in the constituencies. Psychologically it\u2019s an important breakthrough. It\u2019s one we have to build on and expand.\u201d Ukip, led at the assembly by the former Tory MP Neil Hamilton, has also promised to shake things up. Hamilton leapt in with both feet this week when he said the deal with Labour showed that Plaid was a \u201cvery cheap date\u201d, and branded Wood and the Lib Dem Kirsty Williams as Labour\u2019s \u201cpolitical concubines\u201d. Wood said Hamilton\u2019s remarks had made her feel resigned and deflated. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent 17 years building up this institution. There has been an unspoken agreement that certain issues wouldn\u2019t be used as political footballs. Sexism, racism, immigration, the Welsh language, climate change \u2013 we\u2019re all pretty much agreed that these things are territory that we shouldn\u2019t try to make political gain on.  \u201cThat has been overturned by the election of these seven [Ukip members]. I think they were testing the water, trying to seek attention, but I think we need to think seriously how we handle it. It could quickly descend into something very ugly.\u201d  Unlike the SNP in Scotland, independence is not something Plaid is focusing on at the moment. Wood accepts Wales needs to feel more prosperous before that issue can be higher on the agenda.  \u201cAll of our manifesto is designed to try to close the prosperity gap between Wales and the rest of the UK. For many people that is the key question. We have to demonstrate progress before people will be open to consider independence. Closing that economic gap will be our priority over the next five years.\u201d  And afterwards? \u201cCome back to us on that in five years\u2019 time.\u201d",
