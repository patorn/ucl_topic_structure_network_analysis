Joe Penhall\u2019s terrific play, first seen 16 years ago, reminds us they may also be locked in fierce battles with senior consultants. The big issue is whether Christopher, a young black guy who believes that oranges are blue and Idi Amin is his father, should be turfed out of an NHS psychiatric hospital and thrust back into the community after a month of treatment. Robert, the top man, argues for an instant release, which is vehemently opposed by his apprentice, Bruce.  What is startling is how much Penhall packs into his play. He raises, in multiple ways, attitudes to race in Britain today: he not only shows Christopher being used as a ping-pong ball by two white practitioners but questions the myth that there is some cheerfully tolerant community to which he may be returned, and asks why the incidence of mental illness is apparently so high among members of the African-Caribbean population. But this is also a play about the way shortage of bed space dictates medical decisions, and about the tendency within all professions towards a self-obsessed conspiracy against the laity.     \u2018Three tremendous performances\u2019 \u2026 David Haig, Luke Norris and Daniel Kaluuya. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian     Jeremy Herbert\u2019s design follows the original in turning the stage into a boxing ring but goes further in inviting the audience to thread their way through the spartan corridors of a strip-lit institution. Matthew Xia\u2019s production rightly allows the balance of sympathy to constantly shift and yields three tremendous performances. David Haig as Robert exploits to the full his capacity to move in a second from paternalistic benevolence to throttled, brick-red rage. Luke Norris artfully suggests that Bruce\u2019s protective care for his patient conceals a fundamental contempt and a knee-jerk rejection of authority. Daniel Kaluuya brilliantly shows that, while Christopher may well be suffering a borderline personality disorder, he is also alert to the power battles he has provoked and perfectly capable of exploiting them.  Some plays, acclaimed on a first showing, shrink on revival. Penhall\u2019s has actually gained in authority with time.    At the Young Vic, London, until 2 July. Box office: 020-7922 2923",
