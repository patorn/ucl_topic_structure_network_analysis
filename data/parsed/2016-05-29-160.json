  "body": "The purpose of any interview is to find the best person for the job. But with candidates\u2019 nerves jangling and the recruitment crisis causing increased pressure, it can be hard to make sure the right appointment is made. So we\u2019ve spoken to a range of headteachers and deputies from across the UK to find their top tips on how to be a good interviewer. Here are some insider tips: Set the questions Selecting the right questions ahead of interviews is key, according to Andy Smith, headteacher of Carluke high school in South Lanarkshire. \u201cYou need to develop a clear picture of the behaviours, knowledge and skills you would expect the successful candidate to have, and tailor the questions to ensure that you draw these out,\u201d he says.   Related: Five ways to nail your final term as a trainee teacher    \u201cThey should be clear, concise and open.\u201d For example: \u201cPlease describe how you have improved learning and teaching in your current post and tell us how you know you have been successful.\u201d The headteacher might select the questions alone or in consultation with other panel members. For some promoted posts, the questions may be decided upon by a leeting panel, while some local authorities have standard question banks. Decide which panel member will be asking each question and take time to discuss what a model answer might be. You could write down the key points you\u2019re looking for, or ask particular panel members to take careful notes relating to particular questions (to avoid everyone scribbling furiously at the same time). And make sure you talk about what will happen if the panel can\u2019t reach agreement. Peter Kent, headteacher of Lawrence Sheriff school in Rugby, says: \u201cThe interview should be an extended conversation that helps you get to know the person. Tricky questions can often achieve little if they merely put the interviewee on edge.\u201d Get set up It\u2019s important to adopt a tone that is both professional and relaxed. Have water and tissues to hand, make sure phones are switched off, hang a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, and arrange the seating so that is not too close to heaters. \u201cSit around a table, keep the panel small and avoid a sense of rushing,\u201d says Kent. Carefully consider where you hold the interview too. \u201cI was once interviewed in a room with a corrugated roof,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHail stones started and the interview turned into a shouting match.\u201d The questioning You might want to consider how the interview questions could be rephrased in advance as candidates are allowed to ask for this. It\u2019s also a good idea to give the candidate an idea of the running order from the outset, and that there will be a set bank of questions for each candidate, to make them feel comfortable. Lee Card, deputy headteacher at Cherry Orchard primary school in Worcester, adds: \u201c[Make clear] that individual responses may elicit further follow-up questions and discussions. This assures candidates that you are not drilling away at a response because it wasn\u2019t a good one.\u201d You can also ease candidates in before getting to more technical questions. Sharon McLellan, headteacher of Laurieknowe primary school in Dumfries, says it is good to start with a settling in style question.    Related: Recruitment lessons: how Japan and Australia attract teachers into rural schools    Robin Bevan, headteacher at Southend high school for boys in Essex and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) national leadership representative, recommends using questions that don\u2019t have an obvious answer. For example: \u201cHow would you handle a pupil who is refusing to comply with your instructions?\u201d could lend itself to a textbook response. You could re-phrase this to: \u201cCan you give me an example of a time when a pupil refused to comply with your instructions? What did you do and what effect did it have?\u201d As a follow-up: \u201cIf you encountered the same situation again, is there anything you would do differently?\u201d Bevan is also a fan of questions that give a flavour of the individual, such as: \u201cWhat do you do to relax?\u201d, and those that require the candidate to talk at some length, such as: \u201cCan you tell me about your favourite bit of chemistry?\u201d \u201cIf they come across as unenthused on their favourite topic, then I don\u2019t want anything to do with them,\u201d he says. Keep to time You might be spending a full day interviewing, with lunch and coffee breaks scheduled in, so it\u2019s important that candidates aren\u2019t allowed to go beyond their allocated time. \u201cSetting out expectations at the start of the interview will help,\u201d says Smith. Feedback It\u2019s easy to fall into a trap of positively encouraging candidates. But Smith cautions against this: \u201cDon\u2019t give praise after responses. A polite \u2018thank you\u2019 is sufficient. You don\u2019t want unsuccessful candidates who have been told their answers were \u2018fantastic\u2019 or \u2018brilliant\u2019. This makes feedback very difficult.\u201d At the end of the interview, Alan Crawford, assistant principal of Shireland Collegiate Academy in Birmingham, says it is important to be clear with candidates about when they will hear the panel\u2019s final decision. You should also devote enough time to give feedback to unsuccessful candidates. Involve students Rather than relying on the interview alone, it\u2019s good to use a number of methods to help you identify the best candidate, such as giving the pupil council an opportunity to meet the potential new recruits. And it is highly likely that you will want to see the candidates teach. As Ralph Surman, deputy head of Cantrell primary school in Nottingham, says: \u201cThey are not going to know the children, but that doesn\u2019t matter. I am looking to see if they would fit into the context of the school. Would they be the right kind of person to teach the kind of pupils that we have?\u201d You might also want to include a written task for secondary teachers based on the academic content of their subject, for example a question from a recent A-level paper. Offer candidates a tour of the school, but be sure to show them round individually. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d says Bevan, \u201cyou get a fairly horrible piece of behaviour emerging \u2013 the competitive question asking.\u201d Trust your instincts   Related: 10 professional development ideas for teachers    It\u2019s important to remember that interviewing is a dynamic process, and the person who looks strongest on paper might not turn out to be the best on the day. As Kent says: \u201cWe need process and rigour, but my experience is that instinct is often a key indicator in finding the right person.\u201d It also helps to be prepared for the unexpected, according to McLellan. \u201cI once interviewed with a colleague and one of the candidates had a complete meltdown and was inconsolable,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother time, I had to stop an interview when it became clear that the candidate hadn\u2019t the first clue what we were asking. He had been away from teaching for several years \u2013 a fact he omitted from his fabulous, well-written application form. \u201cAs for the taciturn candidate who stated, straight-faced, \u2018I am very enthusiastic\u2019\u2026 Let\u2019s just say my colleague and I had to suppress our sudden, surprisingly synchronised, coughing fits.\u201d Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach.
