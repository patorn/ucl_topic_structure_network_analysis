  "body": "Leicester City will return to Thailand on tour this summer with a warning from the owners there must be no repeat of the behaviour that led to the sacking of three young players last June. The dismissals were prompted by their participation in a racist orgy during what was supposed to be a goodwill trip to the homeland of the club\u2019s billionaire owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. Vichai\u2019s son Aiyawatt, Leicester\u2019s vice-chairman, is eager for the team to go back to his country, where their popularity has soared as a result of their performances this season. He has taken the precaution of reminding players of their responsibilities to avert any scandal on a par with last year\u2019s ordeal, when footage taken during the trip showed Tom Hopper, Adam Smith and James Pearson \u2013 the son of the club\u2019s then-manager Nigel Pearson \u2013 laughing and verbally abusing three Thai women after sex. The players were dismissed and Pearson left as manager shortly afterwards.   Related: Julian Barnes: my stupid Leicester City love    \u201cI want them to see the Thai people, how welcome they are,\u201d Aiyawatt said of this summer\u2019s travel plans. \u201cThey are massive now and they want to say thank you to the Thai fans. The players need privacy as well but I\u2019ve talked to them and they know they need to treat everything well. You are popular, that is great, and people come to see you because they admire you and they want to talk to you. They will talk to you like you\u2019re their son. So be proud and enjoy.\u201d Aiyawatt, who is referred to in Leicester by his nickname, Top, did not go into detail about the discussions he had with Nigel Pearson following last year\u2019s trouble but said he had little option but to find a new manager. \u201cIt was difficult, I understand the situation but it\u2019s happened \u2013 we have to find the right way for the club so I had to make the decision.\u201d One positive side-effect was that it led to the appointment of Claudio Ranieri, who, according to Aiyawatt, wowed his prospective employers during his first interview. \u201cClaudio was my first choice even though I had three or four more to interview,\u201d Aiyawatt said. \u201cHe had something special on that day and in his interview when he spoke he said everything that was in my head. I don\u2019t know how he did that! He was the one that could take the club forward for sure.\u201d When the appointment was announced, many observers wondered about the wisdom of hiring a manager who had flopped spectacularly with Greece. \u201cI asked him [about that] because I wanted to know,\u201d Aiyawatt said. \u201cHe answered everything very clearly, why he failed there, why things happened in the past. I love his character and the way he talks. And now you have seen how he takes the pressure off everyone and the club. He knows how to manage that well.\u201d The chief pressure back then was to avoid relegation. \u201cRealistically we still had to build a team. We were still in the developing process for the football club and for myself as the owner. It is important to build with sure foundations.\u201d If the club\u2019s managerial appointment has been vindicated, so too has their player recruitment. Expensive misses such as Andrej Kramaric and G\u00f6khan Inler have been far outweighed by cut-price sensations such as Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. They are worth many multiples of the fees paid for them by Leicester when they were unheralded signings. Leicester need to deepen their squad as they try to retain their title while competing in next season\u2019s Champions League, and Aiyawatt believes they can still unearth bargains even though Leicester\u2019s success has driven other clubs to improve their scouting. He suggested Leicester\u2019s playing style may ensure they still have an advantage over big clubs who demand a more dominant approach.   Related: Claudio Ranieri deserves acclaim. He did more than just say the right thing | Paul Wilson    \u201cNowadays it\u2019s so difficult \u2013 people will try to find the second Mahrez, Kant\u00e9 and Vardy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it depends on the policy of the club. If you ask me why no one found Kant\u00e9, there has to be a reason. He doesn\u2019t play in the way they want. \u201cLeicester play in the way he does; many clubs don\u2019t play like Leicester. Everyone has their own way to manage everything but the way we want \u2013 players to come and prove themselves \u2013 is very clear. Many people found him but weren\u2019t sure of him. We wanted him because of the numbers I got \u2013 not the fee but the stats \u2013 and we decided.\u201d The champions will try to mark their final home match of the season by beating Everton at the King Power Stadium on Saturday and Ranieri said his team will play with their habitual intensity despite their partying following Monday\u2019s confirmation of their Premier League triumph. When Leicester clinched promotion from the Championship two seasons ago they lost their next home match 4-1 to Brighton but Ranieri said this time the players\u2019 standards will not slip, quipping that otherwise: \u201cI will kill them with my hands!\u201d",
