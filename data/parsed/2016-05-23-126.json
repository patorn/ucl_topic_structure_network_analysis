  "body": "Christopher Pyne has rejected a further suggestion that the Coalition\u2019s Direct Action climate policy could operate as a de facto emissions trading scheme, telling the ABC\u2019s Q&A program the scheme was not intended to work that way. Pyne, the industry minister, and his regular sparring partner, opposition frontbencher Anthony Albanese, were the only two panellists on Monday\u2019s election special, which fell in week three of the eight-week campaign.  The environment minister, Greg Hunt, dismissed questions at the National Press Club last week about whether the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d of the scheme could be triggered to require companies who exceed their baseline emissions to buy pollution permits, effectively turning it into a cap and trade scheme.       Guardian Australia previously reported that an associate at Energetics, the firm that conducted modelling of potential abatement,, said the intended reductions could be achieved by putting a lot more money into the emissions reduction fund or by tightening the safeguard mechanism.  The idea was pushed further by Alan Kohler in The Australian on Monday, who said the Coalition\u2019s policy was a \u201csecret ETS [emissions trading scheme].\u201d When the question was raised on Q&A, Pyne said he could not address the issue because he had not been told to read Kohler\u2019s column before the show. Labor voted with the Greens and the Coaliton to introduce the policy last year, but is campaigning on the basis of introducing a formal emissions trading scheme.  Asked by host Tony Jones if his vote in parliament meant he would support the Coalition introducing a de facto cap-and-trade scheme, Albanese also deflected by saying he had not read the Kohler column.          #QandA: Questioner is right. 'Safeguard mechanism' has potential to be an emissions trading scheme - but only if govt pulls the lever.\u2014 Peter Hannam (@p_hannam) May 23, 2016    It was one of a number of points of agreement between the two frontbenchers, whose comfortable double-act is honed from their regular Friday morning appearances on Channel Nine\u2019s Today show.  They were in agreement about defence spending, the offshore processing of refugees (though Albanese said Labor\u2019s proposed doubling of the refugee quota would give people the \u201chope\u201d they needed to remain in formal refugee camps), the need for more funding of vocational education and TAFE programs, support for the Australian steel industry, superannuation tax increases (although not whether they should be retrospective), and hatred of the Greens.       Points of contention included the National Broadband Network (NBN), which Pyne said would ensure people got \u201cthe speeds they want and need,\u201d a metric he later described as the ability to watch five movies simultaneously (\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of movies! That\u2019s a lot of televisions!\u201d). Albanese, who was briefly communications minister during the second Rudd government, said the NBN \u201cisn\u2019t about movies, it\u2019s about the economy\u201d and that the copper-to-the-home model being rolled out by Malcolm Turnbull, both as communications minister and later as prime minister, was \u201c19th century technology.\u201d       Another battle arose over the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, and his comment last week that most refugees were illiterate and innumerate, which Albanese characterised as dog-whistling and Pyne as misunderstood.    i'm not watching q&A but i bet pyne and albo debating their identical asylum seeker policy must be thrilling\u2014 thomas violence (@thomas_violence) May 23, 2016    Pyne, who described the slimmed-down format as a \u201cfireside chat\u201d and insisted Jones refer to both he and Albanese by their first names, concluded by urging voters to support either the Liberal party or the ALP, saying \u201cOnly the Liberal party and the Labor party can deliver. We\u2019re the only people that can form government.\u201d Albanese, unsurprisingly, agreed. He has been facing pressure from the Greens in his inner-west Sydney seat of Grayndler, a battle News Corp-owned tabloid the Daily Telegraph considered so dire it ran the front-page headline: \u201cSave our Albo\u201d. The Greens, he said, did not want to work with the major parties, but instead \u201cthey want to replace us.\u201d       \u201cI think have a look at where they\u2019re concentrating their campaigns,\u201d he said. \u201cThey launched their campaign in my electorate \u2026 I\u2019m not the most right-wing person in the parliament, but that\u2019s who they\u2019re targeting.  \u201c[They\u2019re] spending very little time attacking the Coalition \u2026 their objective is to try to take over a few inner-city seats, but that won\u2019t change things.\u201d    Left wing party in targeting left leaning seats shock. #qanda\u2014 Quietly Confident (@jonkudelka) May 23, 2016",
