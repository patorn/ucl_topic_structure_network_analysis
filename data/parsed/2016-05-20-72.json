  "body": "It was Louisiana state representative Kenny Havard\u2019s idea of a joke, but not everyone was laughing.  During a session in the Louisiana house on Wednesday, Havard submitted a tongue-in-cheek amendment to a bill regulating strip clubs to combat human trafficking, proposing restricting the age and weight of strippers in Louisiana to under 29 and 160 pounds respectively.  Met with a mix of guffaws and disbelief, Havard quickly removed his amendment after a protest from fellow Republican representative Nancy Landry. He thought it was the end of what he considered to be a little joke; really, it was only the beginning.            Before the day was out the story had spread throughout the country and he found himself facing both a barrage of media attention as well as calls for an apology from many of his colleagues. The amendment, combined with the light-hearted reaction towards it from many of his male colleagues, immediately drew rebukes from members of the legislature and prompted widespread accusations of sexism and misogyny. \u201cWe\u2019re here representing 40,000 people back home,\u201d Landry told the Advocate. \u201cHalf of them are women. They\u2019re mothers, daughters, sisters, and we\u2019re here representing the state as the face of Louisiana to some extent ... I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d For many familiar with politics at the Louisiana state capitol, Havard\u2019s comments were nothing out of the ordinary. \u201c(The legislature) literally is an old boys\u2019 club,\u201d Louisiana journalist and political historian Robert Mann says. \u201cThe Louisiana legislature has one of the lowest percentages of women elected to its house and senate, and I think that is one reason why some of these guys think they can act the way they do \u2013 with such callous disregard for not just the feelings of women but the interests of women.  \u201cThere aren\u2019t as many (women) around, and these are \u2013 literally, in many cases \u2013 old boys who have come from another era where treating women with respect or caring about their interests is kind of an alien, foreign notion.\u201d Louisiana is currently ranked 45th in the nation for the proportion of women in state legislature, with only five women in the senate and 16 in the house. Mann says insensitive attitudes by male legislators \u2013 typified by Havard\u2019s comments \u2013 are part of the reason why that ratio is so low. \u201cI think women look at stuff like this and they see how they are treated, how women are devalued in a governmental institution, and who can blame them for not wanting to be a part of that?\u201d he says. \u201cTo many women it\u2019s an institution where they\u2019re just going to be treated as some sort of shiny object, a place that pats them on the head and says \u2018there, there\u2019 whenever they\u2019re subjected to something like this.\u201d The furor over Havard\u2019s amendment came during a rocky week for women\u2019s rights in the state legislature. On Thursday, while Havard was coming under fire, a house committee voted down Governor John Bel Edwards\u2019 bill requiring private businesses to pay equal wages for men and women. In an arguably bigger blow last Wednesday, the state legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill requiring women to wait 72 hours before having an abortion, tripling the current time of 24 hours. Louisiana now stands alongside only Oklahoma, Utah, Missouri, and North and South Carolina as states with the longest abortion wait time in the nation. It\u2019s proving to be a tough time for woman\u2019s advocacy groups in Louisiana. \u201cThe equal pay bill was something we were pushing especially hard for,\u201d National Organization for Women Baton Rouge chapter president Angela Adkins says. Adkins, who visits the state capitol several times a week, was unsurprised by Havard\u2019s amendment and his subsequent reaction. \u201cYou hear comments between legislators, male legislators,\u201d she says. \u201cYou hear them between legislators and lobbyists. I\u2019m at the capitol two, three times a week and it\u2019s always there.\u201d \u201cThe amendment was disgusting and demeaning to half the population in the state,\u201d she adds. \u201cI looked back over Kenny Havard\u2019s voting record and he voted against anything that would help women and children in this state \u2026 it just goes to show what women and children are thought of by our elected officials.\u201d  Havard, who did not directly respond to requests for comment from The Guardian, later said that he\u2019d simply been trying to make a point about excessive governmental regulation in the bill \u2013 which passed 96-0, with Havard\u2019s vote \u2013 and he regretted offending his female colleagues. Still, over a day after proposing and withdrawing the amendment, he refused to apologize. \u201cMaybe it could have been done differently,\u201d he told reporters in the lobby of the state capitol on Thursday afternoon, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever apologize for being politically incorrect. It\u2019s just not in my nature to do that. Political correctness is, in my opinion, ruining the country and \u2026 our state.\u201d",
