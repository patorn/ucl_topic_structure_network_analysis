Coca-Cola HBC, one of the drinks group\u2019s bottlers, is among the biggest losers, down 55p at \u00a313.42 following news that first quarter revenues had fallen by 2.7%. The company was hit by weak emerging market currencies and the strength of the euro. Analyst Phil Carroll at Shore Capital said:  Overall, a slight miss from a forecasts perspective but the underlying performance was slightly stronger than the figures suggest due to one less trading day. We continue to see forecast risk as we move towards the seasonally more important summer trading months from both foreign exchange especially in relation to Nigeria and the beneficial trading conditions from the warmer summer weather in a number of European markets last year. Therefore, on a 2016 forecast valuation of 19.1 times and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 9.0 times, we retain our sell recommendation.  Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 35.14 points to 6069.05, with Brent crude dipping 0.85% to $47.67 as the dollar strengthened following comments from US Federal Reserve members suggesting a June rate rise was still possible. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:  A weak finish on Wall Street combined with a disappointing Asian session has once again set the pace for London equities as Friday\u2019s trade gets underway. A break below the 6,000 level is certainly something that cannot be overlooked and that would be the first time in almost three months that we\u2019ve been down here.  Looking ahead, US advance retail sales figures will be under close scrutiny later in the session as investors desperately need something to cheer. Yesterday\u2019s surprise jump in weekly jobless claims across the Atlantic added more misery into markets globally so it could be that even mild disappointment here is all it will take to lead London\u2019s blue chip territory to within a whisker of the 6,000 mark.  Inmarsat, which has been under pressure since the satellite communications group cut its full year revenue guidance last week, is down 43.5p to 750.5p. The latest decline follows a downbeat update from peer Eutelsat. Morgan Stanley said:  The Eutelsat profits warning has significant implications and can be expected to be read through to other industry players.  With gold and silver moving higher as investors seek havens in a volatile market, Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo is up 22p at \u00a310.97 while Randgold Resources has risen 25p to \u00a361.95.",
