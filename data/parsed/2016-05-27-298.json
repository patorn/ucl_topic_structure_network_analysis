  "body": "An 81-year-old farmer farmer has been found guilty of the murder of a New South Wales environment officer he shot after a long-running dispute over land clearing. A jury found Ian Turnbull guilty in the NSW supreme court of murdering Office of Environment and Heritage compliance officer Glen Turner, 51, at his Croppa Creek property in the state\u2019s north in July 2014. The five-week trial heard Turnbull shot Turner three times in July 2014 with a rifle used to kill vermin, after a lengthy legal battle with the department.   Related: Farmer was deeply depressed when he killed environmental officer, court hears    The supreme court jury returned its verdict after six and a half hours of deliberations on Friday. Turnbull showed little emotion when the six-man, six-woman jury handed down the verdict. Members of Turner\u2019s family embraced and wiped away tears. During the trial the jury was told Turnbull held the wounded Turner and fellow departmental official Robert Strange under his control for up to 40 minutes, firing the lethal shot as Turner tried to flee. The attack followed years of tension and a legal battle with the environment department over allegations of illegal land clearing on the Turnbull family\u2019s properties. Turnbull\u2019s defence team argued for a manslaughter verdict on the basis of substantial impairment, saying the farmer had been suffering severe depression at the time. But the jury rejected that argument with Friday\u2019s verdict. Turner\u2019s partner, Alison McKenzie, and sister Fran Pearce expressed relief at the verdict and criticised the way Turnbull\u2019s defence team had sought to portray the 51-year-old victim. Pearce said the trial was hijacked by the defence and turned into an attack on her brother\u2019s character, and a platform for the Turnbull \u201cdynasty\u201d to express their grievance over native vegetation laws. \u201cThe murderer was portrayed as the victim \u2013 a poor, depressed, respectable farmer driven to despair by the Office of Environment and Heritage,\u201d she told reporters outside court. \u201cIn reality, he is a wealthy property developer who simply refused to accept that the law applied to him. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict does not bring Glen back, but we do take some comfort knowing that justice has been done.\u201d \u201cThe decimation of Glen\u2019s character, and we weren\u2019t able to stand up and say what a great man he was \u2013 that was the hardest part for me,\u201d she said. A sentencing hearing has been set for 15 June.",
