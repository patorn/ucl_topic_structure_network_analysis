  "body": "David Cameron is avoiding a head-to-head television debate with Boris Johnson or Michael Gove because he is concerned about turning the EU referendum campaign into a \u201cTory psychodrama\u201d. Senior figures at Vote Leave, the official campaign for Britain to leave the EU, in which Johnson and Gove play leading roles, were infuriated by the prime minister\u2019s decision to appear in an ITV programme with Nigel Farage but not to debate either of their men face to face.   Related: Three newspapers to be reported to Ipso over 'inaccurate' EU stories    In an interview with LBC radio, Cameron said: \u201cI want to prove the breadth of the campaign and I don\u2019t want this to become a sort of Tory psychodrama between me and Boris or me and Michael Gove.\u201d However, he hinted that he may appear at a BBC event that could place him alongside one of his pro-Brexit colleagues. Conservatives, including cabinet ministers, on either side of the debate have clashed repeatedly throughout the campaign, exposing the deep rift in the party over the issue, with Johnson accusing the prime minister this month of \u201ctotally demented scaremongering\u201d. Cameron said he was keen for the debate not to be reduced to one among his own side. \u201cI want to demonstrate that those arguing to stay in the European Union \u2026 include the Labour party, the Green party, the Liberal Democrat party, the trade union movement, most of British industry, the majority of small businesses,\u201d he told LBC\u2019s Iain Dale. Asked whether he was \u201cfurious\u201d about Johnson\u2019s decision to throw his weight behind the campaign to leave, the prime minister said: \u201cI am human so obviously I was disappointed.\u201d He added of Johnson: \u201cHe says he was torn. He\u2019s told a lot of people that he\u2019d never been a leaver. But look, it\u2019s for him to say.\u201d     The justice secretary, Michael Gove, is a leading figure in the leave campaign.

He said negotiations over Cameron\u2019s promise of new legislation to entrench the sovereignty of the British parliament \u2013 in the hope of persuading Johnson to back staying in the EU \u2013 had descended into \u201cfarce\u201d. \u201cIt became ever clearer that the government\u2019s exercise of trying to produce a so-called sovereignty bill \u2013 in which I was involved \u2013 was a farce and would achieve nothing. That is obviously why it has been dropped from the Queen\u2019s speech,\u201d he said. Some backbenchers have become increasingly frustrated at the tone of the campaign, which is being closely coordinated by Downing Street. Steve Baker, the MP who chairs the pro-Brexit Conservatives for Britain group, accused Britain Stronger in Europe of pursuing a \u201cscorched earth\u201d policy.",
