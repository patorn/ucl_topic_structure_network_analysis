  "body": "Lunch with Mary Portas presents something of a sartorial challenge. You hardly want to turn up for the Queen of Shops wearing a dodgy outfit hauled from the back of the wardrobe; then again, dress too sharply and you might find yourself becoming an unwitting philanthropist. We meet for lunch in the Greenberry Caf\u00e9 in London\u2019s Primrose Hill, just a few doors up from one of Portas\u2019s Living & Giving charity shops, which she and Save the Children set up in 2009. There are now 20 of them, and Portas will go along and open new additions to the chain, recalling an occasion when her wife, journalist Melanie Rickey, came too. The couple were having lunch at a nearby cafe afterwards when a woman came up and congratulated Portas on the shop. Alas, Rickey recognised her very own Burberry mac. Portas concedes that she should have asked before donating it \u2013 though, she adds, she hadn\u2019t seen her wearing it for ages. I\u2019m not 100% convinced she\u2019s learned her lesson, given that her daughter Verity recently spotted her Clarks Wallabee shoes in the basement of a branch \u2013 though her mother did let her reclaim them and furnished the shop with a replacement. She tells me she spent the previous day doing nothing, although that turns out to be a Portas kind of nothing \u2013 listening to opera, making an apple crumble and clearing out a cupboard in the house she shares with Rickey, their son Horatio, nearly four, and, when they\u2019re home from university, her older children, Mylo and Verity. \u201cWe have too much stuff in this world!\u201d laughs Portas. I shift my jacket to another chair. This is Portas\u2019s local, and local is one of her favourite words. \u201cThat looks stunning!\u201d she cries, as a colourful salad arrives. \u201cLook, it matches my hair! This is our local caff!\u201d In all truth, you might struggle to find a proper fry-up along this chi-chi street, home to long established restaurants such as Limonia and Odette\u2019s and all manner of upscale boutiques, but Greenberry is popular, filled to bursting on a Monday lunchtime, with punters from architect Ron Arad in his trademark upturned brim hat to tiny-totted families. Over herrings and quinoa and pomegranate seeds, Portas and I fall to talking about the food she grew up eating; it\u2019s a theme that runs through her memoir, Shop Girl, in which she describes growing up as Mary Newton, the fourth of five children in an Irish family in Watford. The book is written in a series of sketches, and dinners range from the salvaged steak that was distributed throughout the neighbourhood following a fire at a butcher\u2019s factory to the advent, in 1974, of Vesta curry, which Portas\u2019s mother serves with a bowl of mash, prompting her daughter to ask, \u201cIs it supposed to be crunchy?\u201d But period nostalgia is only one aspect of the book. When Portas was 16, her mother \u2013 misdiagnosed as menopausal and prescribed antidepressants \u2013 died unexpectedly of meningitis. Portas stepped into the domestic breach, helped by shopkeepers who would advise her on cuts of meat and vegetables. Their role in her life has informed her commitment to the importance of retailers to communities; many of them, she explains, \u201care what kept me rooted in the day, and guided me, and I don\u2019t think you can overestimate that\u201d. Her traumatic introduction to housekeeping stunted any early enthusiasm for the kitchen. \u201cI had it sort of thrust upon me, being a cook,\u201d she says, \u201cand so those early days weren\u2019t very much fun.\u201d What was it like, I ask her, to bring to life years in which her father also died and she found herself adrift? \u201cThe weird thing is,\u201d she replies, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t really go into the public eye until my mid-40s, you don\u2019t ever really articulate that pain, or have to, unless to your partner, or you have memories, where you\u2019re in those intimate situations where you can reflect on those times.\u201d But things shifted when, in 2010 \u2013 by now, a columnist and TV presenter \u2013 Portas went on Desert Island Discs, and started to talk about her childhoodand family. \u201cI came out of recording and I rang Melanie, and I couldn\u2019t speak. It had uncovered it in the most wonderful way \u2013 stuff that I hadn\u2019t really dealt with. And so I decided to write these little vignettes down.\u201d Aside from her own recollections, she gathered together her siblings, \u201cand it was joyous. Did I cry? Yes. And I remember the day I was looking at Mylo and Verity, who were 16 and 14, and that was me, and that was Lawrence [her younger brother]. And I was running the home. And I think I just grieved for that, really, and I don\u2019t mean in any \u2018poor me\u2019 sense ... I put a shell round myself to get through life, and actually I wanted to protect that girl and write about her, and at the end of it, I liked her.\u201d To hear her speak about the fear she felt following her parents\u2019 deaths \u2013 \u201cyou were an orphan. So there was nobody to go home to on a Sunday. There was no home\u201d \u2013 chimes, unsurprisingly, with Portas\u2019s forthright, no-nonsense persona. If you\u2019ve reached the other side of such a profound loss still standing, you might well be inclined to grasp what life has to offer. Portas got a job dressing windows at Harrods, and later joined Harvey Nichols as creative director, joining the board before she was 30, by which point she also had two children with her husband, Graham Portas. She left when she couldn\u2019t get a bonus for a hard-working colleague: \u201cI thought, GOODBYE,\u201d she remembers, handed in her company Mercedes, got the tube home and started her own agency. She and the family lived out of a tin of money kept in the kitchen. Portas still has her agency, plus media work, charity shops and lecturing. But she has also had some fairly mixed experiences working with politicians \u2013 both as the public face of the \u201cPortas Pilot\u201d towns earmarked for investment, and as the author of a review into the future of the high street commissioned by the government in 2011. Suffice to say she has little time for the manipulations and manoeuvres of political life. At the same time, she has an undimmed enthusiasm for imagining what communities could and should look like. Her current thinking is that town centres need to deliver what online spaces can\u2019t, via \u201canchors\u201d \u2013 yoga centres, libraries, creches \u2013 that extend beyond retailing.   Related: Mary Portas: 'I'm one of the best in the world at retail'    Like many, she bemoans London\u2019s increasing unaffordability, and the narrowing it\u2019s likely to have on cultural life, arguing that government should identify spaces in all parts of the capital in which to build housing with capped prices for the under-35s. We are, she says, \u201cthe most creative country in the world, and undoubtedly, the greatest creativity comes out of this city\u201d. Would she ever want to be mayor of London? \u201cBe an amazing job to do, wouldn\u2019t it? But no, because of all that\u2026 it\u2019s politics\u2026 and it\u2019s a shame because I do realise there are some politicians who genuinely care. And you look at Obama \u2013 he\u2019s been unable to be Obama because of the system. And so we are actually looking at the thought that some shredded wheat, vile, hideous individual, could possibly take over from him. It is beyond shocking.\u201d In the middle of all this activity, Portas, now sipping tea, meditates, reads philosophy and walks to calm her mind; \u201cI\u2019m very thinky,\u201d she says. And she also spends a great deal of time ensuring that her own family enjoys the stability that she herself did until it was abruptly interrupted. \u201cOne of the worst things that ever happened when Mum died,\u201d she tells me, \u201cwas coming home to an empty house. It was just the worst \u2013 from coming home never having a key, opening the gate, opening the back door, the smell of cooking, your mum there, there might be someone chatting with her \u2013 but it was home. To opening the front door \u2013 just, dead. Grey, nothing. Nothing moved since you left that morning, you\u2019d left your dirty dishes because you were in a hurry, nothing smelt clean because you hadn\u2019t been there during the day.\u201d She recalls the tussle between her and Lawrence \u2013 \u201cboth of us wanting to get there first so at least one person would say hello when you got in\u201d \u2013 which led to what she calls an obsession with her own children never having to come into an empty house. She laughs. About four years ago, her daughter casually mentioned that her favourite time was when she got home and the house was empty \u2013 she could get what she wanted out of the fridge, put some music on, normal teenage stuff. Portas was shocked: \u201cSorry? Did you say your fav\u2013\u2026 and then I thought, because you\u2019re safe. And I\u2019ve given you that safety.\u201d     They ate (Alex) Pickled herrings, beetroot, horseradish relish, sourdough toast, \u00a38; (Mary) wild rice, quinoa, sweet potato, feta, mint, spring onion, pomegranate salad \u00a310.25; (shared) Greenberry salad.
