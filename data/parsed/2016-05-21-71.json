  "body": "In a final-day match-up that many aficionados believe could be played out often in years to come, Austria\u2019s Dominic Thiem survived a dogged early challenge from fellow rising star Alexander Zverev to retain his Nice Open title. The 15th-ranked Thiem, top seed at the ATP 250 event, won 6-4, 3-6, 6-0 in one hour and 39 minutes to claim a place alongside former French Open champions Bjorn Borg and Ilie Nastase as a double winner on the French Riviera. Whether the 22-year-old can go on to emulate the feats of those illustrious forebears at Roland Garros is a moot point, but claiming the fifth title of his fledgling career \u2013 and fourth on clay \u2013 should ensure he heads north to Paris, where he is the 13th seed, with no shortage of confidence. Few will relish the prospect of facing him, not even the nine-time champion Rafael Nadal, whom he could play in the fourth round.

The two men will resume hostilities at Roland Garros should they both progress to round three and, despite suffering a final-set whitewash, Zverev showed enough early on to suggest that a successful tilt at revenge is well within his capabilities. The gods have not always smiled on the 48th-ranked teenager at key moments this year. In March, Zverev played virtually flawless tennis to reach match point against Nadal in Indian Wells, only to fluff a simple forehand volley with the Spaniard at his mercy. This time his momentum was arrested through no fault of his own, a nosebleed forcing him to take a medical timeout after he had broken to take a 4-2 lead in the opening set. When play resumed, Zverev surrendered the advantage with a double fault, throwing Thiem a lifeline that the Austrian gleefully accepted with a run of six straight games that left him a set and a break to the good. Yet, as he showed in saving two match points against Gilles Simon in the quarter-finals, Zverev is not one to capitulate in testing circumstances. Capitalising on a shoulder injury that forced Thiem to call for the trainer, the teenager broke back immediately and won six of the next seven games to force a third set. There, though, he was comprehensively outplayed, failing to win a point on his opponent\u2019s first serve and claiming just three behind his own delivery. Meanwhile, Stanislas Wawrinka, the reigning French Open champion, completed his preparations for Roland Garros with a straight sets victory over Marin Cilic, the former US Open champion, in the Geneva Open final. The top-seeded Wawrinka came through a tight second set to win 6-3, 7-6 (13-11) and claim the first title of his career on home soil.",
