  "body": "After a raging wildfire destroyed dozens of homes, engulfed a neighbourhood in flames, and forced the hurried evacuation of an entire city, authorities in Canada warned that the worst was probably still to come.  More than 80,000 residents were ordered to leave the city of Fort McMurray in northern Alberta on Tuesday, after shifting winds saw the blaze go from being largely in control to a \u201cnasty, ugly\u201d inferno, as described by the local fire chief. Residents scrambled to make their way out of the city, sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the main route out of the city and struggling to see the road through the thick grey haze that blanketed the highway. Flames licked the road and ash rained down on vehicles, while air tankers and helicopters flew overhead. Gas pumps soon ran dry, leaving many residents stranded on the highway overnight.

No one is hurt and no one is passed away right now. I really hope we can get to the end of this and we can still say that.\u201d He described the wildfire as a \u201cnasty, dirty fire\u201d that was raging out of control, adding that all efforts to suppress it have so far failed. \u201cThere are areas of the city that have not been burned, but this fire will look for them, and it will find them, and it will try and take them.\u201d    Related: Fort McMurray: Canada wildfires force evacuation of oil sands city    On Tuesday, 105 patients and clients \u2013 including nine newborn babies \u2013 were evacuated from city\u2019s only hospital as flames approached.The province\u2019s main oil sands region, a number of oil sands work camps near Fort McMurray were turned into impromptu housing for evacuees. Neighbouring communities also reached out to residents as they fled the flames, staffing recreation centres to provide shelter and bringing gas to stranded motorists. Other residents made their way to the evacuation camps that had been set up outside the city or found lodging in the city of Edmonton, some 435km away, where they took stock of what they had left behind. \u201cWhen you leave \u2026 it\u2019s an overwhelming feeling to think that you\u2019ll never see your house again,\u201d Carol Christian told the Canadian Press. Along with her son and cat, she had driven to an evacuation centre. \u201cIt was absolutely horrifying when we were sitting there in traffic. You look up and then you watch all the trees candle-topping \u2026 up the hills where you live and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh my God. We got out just in time.\u2019\u201d Municipal authorities on Wednesday began detailing the damage that had been caused by the wildfire, including one neighbourhood where 80% of the homes were destroyed. Images on social media showed the flattened neighbourhood of Beacon Hill, the rubble of its many destroyed homes strewn about. In another neighbourhood, a dozen trailers also went up in flames, while serious losses were reported in several other areas. Officials estimate that 1,600 structures have so far been damaged or destroyed by the fire.  Some in the city had as little as 30 minutes to evacuate, with many making it out with little more than their vehicle and the clothes on their back. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time for nothing,\u201d said Shawn Brett. He had been at home when his friends called to warn him of the encroaching blaze. He jumped on his Harley motorcycle and made his way out, fighting his way through the smoke and flames that had engulfed his neighbourhood.  \u201cI literally drove through the flames. I had ashes hitting my face and the heat from the fire was that bad,\u201d he told the the Canadian Press. \u201cEverything was jammed. It was nothing but the biggest chaos I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, said on Wednesday he had spoken to the Alberta premier, Rachel Notley, to offer the government\u2019s support. \u201cI really do want to highlight that Canada is a country where we look out for our neighbours, and we are there for each other in difficult times,\u201d Trudeau told his Liberal caucus. \u201cAnd certainly in Fort McMurray, the difficult times they are going through right now is something that we are going to unite around.\u201d He shot down earlier comments made by Elizabeth May, the leader of Canada\u2019s Green Party, that linked the fire to the global climate crisis.  \u201cOne thing we know is that with climate change there will be more extreme events,\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cBut, we know very well that placing a direct link between any fire or a flood and climate change goes a step beyond what is helpful and does not benefit a conversation we must have.\u201d  The premier of Alberta said on Wednesday that she planned to head to Fort McMurray to get a firsthand look at the scope of the crisis. \u201cOur hearts are with the families who have had to leave their homes in Fort McMurray,\u201d said Notley from Edmonton. Nearby communities have sent emergency personnel and vehicles to the city. The provincial government has also been in continuous contact with other provinces and the federal government, she said, and now has the resources needed to battle the blaze. \u201cBut of course the weather is the key issue.\u201d Queen Elizabeth said she was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the news of the wildfires \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been affected, and we send our heartfelt thanks to the firefighters and the other emergency workers,\u201d she said in a statement. The wildfire comes as a devastating blow to a city already reeling from the impact of slumping oil prices, said David Yurdiga, the MP for the area. The Alberta oil sands rank as one of the world\u2019s largest reserves of oil. \u201cEven with the destruction caused by the fire thus far we will need federal funds to get back on our feet,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThis city has seen thousands of people leave their homes because of the downturn in oil. Fort McMurray cannot handle that and this wildfire.\u201d",
