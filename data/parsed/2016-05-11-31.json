Visiting Cornwall on the first day of a Vote Leave bus tour, the former London mayor said he would like the UK to leave the EU so that it could turn away foreign workers who lack job offers or the right skills.  But he was reluctant to say Britain should put a cap on overall numbers, and suggested that unhappiness over immigration was down to the government\u2019s failure to make the right arguments to win public consent.  Johnson\u2019s comments give an insight into how he could approach the issue of immigration if he succeeds David Cameron as Tory leader and prime minister in the event of a Brexit vote.  He said the government had been less than honest with people about the nature of immigration and failed to appreciate the impact on schools, the NHS and other public services.  But he would only say the numbers of new arrivals should not have been so high without the agreement of voters.  \u201cTo add a city the size of Newcastle to the UK every year \u2026 let me put it this way, it\u2019s too high to do without consent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the issue. There is no consent. It might be that a party or government or politicians could persuade people if they believed that it was a good thing and it turbo-charged the economy and all the rest of it. What is not acceptable is to say there\u2019s nothing we can do, that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d  On Thursday data on national insurance numbers is expected to reveal that more EU citizens are working in the UK than are recorded in official statistics.

Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters    In his latest swipe at David Cameron, who is campaigning in favour of remaining within the EU, Johnson said: \u201cI think it has been misleading, there is no question it\u2019s been misleading. I think politicians have been driven into this terrible dishonesty about it by the EU\u2019s arrangements.\u201d He said it was wrong for Cameron and others to have promised to get the annual rate of immigration down to the tens of thousands, from hundreds of thousands, when that was clearly impossible while Britain was in the EU, because that promise was \u201ccorrosive\u201d to public trust.  But pressed on the level of immigration he would like to see himself, he said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to set a figure. You need to look at each sector and you need to look at what the needs of the economy are.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have uncontrolled immigration, but we\u2019re not going to get into the situation of how many and by when \u2013 that depends on the system you bring in. What you don\u2019t have is increases of the scale that we\u2019ve seen in the past few years.\u201d  His answer contrasts sharply with the stance of fellow leave campaigner Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, who wants net immigration reduced to 30,000 to 50,000 a year \u2013 a cut of up to 90% from the current level of more than 300,000.  Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, said on Tuesday that he would still like to keep the target of less than 100,000 and claimed high immigration could lead to a socially divisive \u201cexplosion of have nots\u201d.  Johnson has mostly avoided such arguments, having cast himself as a politician who is largely pro-immigration, but he has joined the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s calls for an Australian-style points system that tries to limit unskilled migration.  Pressed on what immigration policy might be like after Brexit, Johnson said EU citizens already in the UK would be allowed to stay and rejected the suggestion of Dominic Raab, another Vote Leave campaigner and a justice minister, that British people could need visas to travel to the rest of Europe.  Johnson, who is in line for a cabinet job after the referendum, looked uncomfortable as he was questioned about the arguments over immigration in the Brexit debate. But he said he would be happy to take up Gordon Brown\u2019s challenge to a debate about the EU if the out campaign wanted him to do so.  While the remain camp has been keen to keep its focus on the economic arguments for staying, the out campaigners are split about whether to push hard on the issue of Brexit allowing tighter controls on immigration.

For me this is about democracy and accountability and us being dragged into a European superstate.\u201d  Asked about one voter who said he liked Johnson because he told it straight like Enoch Powell, the MP said that was \u201ccertainly not a comparison I would want\u201d. Johnson was repeatedly mobbed by members of the public as he visited a Truro market, where he bought asparagus and brandished a Cornish pasty. \u201cAsparagus will be just as delicious after leaving the EU,\u201d he said, in a dig at the dire warnings about Brexit delivered by the remain campaign. In a pointed remark about Cameron\u2019s speech on Brexit posing a risk to peace, he said: \u201cI think all this talk of world war three and bubonic plague is totally demented, frankly.\u201d  Johnson later claimed he had only met about two supporters of staying in the EU, but several who rushed in for selfies with him had not mentioned they were undecided or likely to back remain.  One woman who stopped for a picture with Johnson and her pug said she had taken a leaflet from him because she wanted to see the arguments, but was \u201cvery probably remain\u201d.  Johnson was confronted by 35-year-old Jenefer Feenan, who wanted to know how student nurses would be supported. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got enough information to make a decision at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cAll these numbers are coming out. You hear one person saying it costs \u00a3350m a day, another \u00a3500m.\u201d     Boris Johnson at St Austell Brewery in Cornwall. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA     As Johnson toured a brewery in St Austell, James Staughton, the managing director showing him around, said he was neutral on the debate, and it soon emerged that the company had accepted \u00a350,000 from the EU to help pay for a new bottling line.  One observer, Jenny Lovett, said she had taken a picture but remained undecided, and Johnson\u2019s interview that morning on the BBC had put her off voting on the same side as him. \u201cI think don\u2019t think this should be about party politics but it does seem to be about that for some people, without mentioning any names,\u201d she said.  Having watched Johnson, Mark Gosbee, 45, said he felt that people for the out campaign \u201cseem a lot more impassioned than the other side\u201d.  \u201cFor purely economic reasons, not to do with immigration, I\u2019m almost certain to vote out, and I do that with a heavy heart because I love Europe without loving the EU,\u201d he said.",
