  "body": "On reflection, the canteen was probably not the best place to loudly conduct an interview about poo and parasitic worms. The conversation was not intended to spill into the lunch hour, but Dr Andrew \u2018Bone\u2019 Jones, an enthusiastic paleoscatologist for over 30 years, had plenty to say.      Paleoscatologist Dr Andrew \u2018Bone\u2019 Jones. Photograph: Dr Anita Radini    His opening gambit: \u201cDid you know, the biggest parasitic nematode [worm] in the world is nine metres in length and only found in the placenta of a sperm whale?\u201d Jones, rarely seen without a bow tie, is an archaeologist who specialises in excrement (scatology) and parasites (parasitology). Now officially retired, but still very much on the scene, he has spent over three decades working for the York Archaeological Trust. It was there in the trust\u2019s archives he discovered the fabled Lloyds Bank turd, a hefty specimen belonging to a Viking with \u201cvery itchy bowels\u201d \u2013 believed to be the largest intact piece of fossilised human faeces ever found. Today the stool, \u201cas precious as the crown jewels\u201d, according to Jones, can be seen at the Jorvik Viking Centre in York. The most exciting thing about it, he says, is the infestation of eggs discovered inside, belonging to ascaris lumbricoides, a parasitic worm that blighted the insides of our ancestors. \u201cThey bore through tissue and have been known to emerge from every orifice of the human body \u2013 including the corner of your eye. Isn\u2019t that horrible!\u201d he says with infectious glee. It made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up when he first learned this nugget at university and it has stayed with him ever since. Another common discovery in old faecal matter are trichuris nematodes \u2013 or whip worms \u2013 that can be found living in their hundreds inside the gut. The biggest infestation Jones ever found was 3,000 worms. These worms would have been an everyday part of people\u2019s lives \u2013 children would pass them, people would cough them up and they\u2019d be particularly prominent at the end of people\u2019s lives.    You are actually just looking at bits of old excrement and, let\u2019s face it, that is a bit odd.  Dr Andrew Jones     \u201cI think my most interesting discovery is just how widespread parasitic diseases were in western Europe before the introduction of flushed lavatories in the early part of the 20th century,\u201d he says.  We go on to talk about worms that wiggle across people\u2019s eyes and others that cause diseases like elephantitis. Then there are pustule-headed dracunculus nematodes, that burst out of blisters. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine how these worms could take on some primal, nightmarish significance and Jones is convinced they have influenced Celtic, iron age and Viking art. While there is so much emphasis on appreciating the marvels of the latest Venus statue to be found in a pit in Tunis, or the like, it is the excrement unearthed alongside these marvels that can tell us how real people lived, Jones says. \u201cWithin the archeology classics community there are a small number of people like me, who are really interested in filth, waste disposal and water supplies as an archeological discipline. We map a history of disease,\u201d he explains. Parasitologists meet irregularly and can be found in clusters at mummy conferences, up the Andes or in churches in Italy, where there are specimens ripe for medical examination. Jones will often find himself in damp, waterlogged sites. Most recently he has done work in Pompeii with the university of Bradford, taking scrapings of the white encrustations found inside pipes and Roman toilets.   Related: \u2018The first time you cut human skin is monumental\u2019    As a teen Jones got involved in archeological excavations: \u201cIt was enormously sociable and I discovered you could have fun exploring mud \u2013 some of that was excrement \u2013 and I just fell into it.\u201d His upbringing on a dairy farm in Devonshire meant he was never one to be prissy about poo. \u201cCows aren\u2019t the most continent animals, they just crap anywhere when it suits them,\u201d he says matter of factly, \u201cso excrement was just part of my cultural heritage and I didn\u2019t think of it as anything odd.\u201d  He remembers the mixture of excrement and mud that the cattle would traipse through, a mess known in Devonshire as a stug. \u201cI have seen some right old stugs in my time, I can tell you,\u201d he says. He went on his first dig in Norfolk and then went on to do a zoology degree. There he took a special interest in parasitology and began carving his niche. But it would very hard to make a living exclusively out of studying excrement, admits Jones. People in the field tend to diversify \u2013 a lot of the community look at pollen, for example, and Jones has expertise in fish remains and does a lot of educational work too. You need a decent biological training, ideally a biological sciences degree, and if you don\u2019t like using a microscope, forget it.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be prepared to spend hours and hours looking down microscopes. But you also need to be quite sociable and make friends with some archaeologists who can supply you with samples to look at,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then you need to be able to write up your findings, or nobody will know you found anything.\u201d Finally, it is important to keep a sense of perspective: \u201cBecause you are actually just looking at bits of old excrement and, let\u2019s face it, that is a bit odd,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I am proud to be called a scatologist and the world needs a small number of people like me\u201d. Jones is trying to raise money for the famous Jorvik Viking Centre, which was badly damaged in the floods of December 2015. Looking for a job?
