The man was working under the non-profit Swiss Foundation for Mine Action (FSD) in the Daquq area, around 120 miles (200km) north of Baghdad. Isis was driven out of Daquq last year but left behind hundreds of improvised explosive devices.  FSD\u2019s programme manager, Alex van Roy, said the man was killed instantly when the bomb containing up to 7kg of explosives blew up. He said the family of the victim had asked that his name be withheld.
