  "body": "The comic actor Javone Prince, 35, grew up in west London and was awarded a full scholarship to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Stage and TV work followed but his breakout role came in the E4 sitcom PhoneShop as the cocky salesman Jerwayne. His eponymous sketch show aired on BBC2 last summer and he has been nominated for best male comedy performance for it at next Sunday\u2019s Bafta awards. He\u2019s currently in The Suicide at the National Theatre and appears this month in Russell T Davies\u2019s BBC adaptation of A\u00a0Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Hi Javone. Where are you right now?Believe it or not, lying in bed. But you\u2019ll be pleased to know I\u2019m not naked. Phew. How did A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream come about?When I heard who else was in it \u2013 Maxine Peake, Nonso Anozie, a very diverse cast \u2013 it sounded exciting. When I got offered the role of Snug, the joiner, I jumped at the chance. You\u2019re something of a Shakespearean veteran, aren\u2019t you?My first ever job was understudying at the RSC. Back at drama school, teachers told me I was really good at Shakespeare. I love music and rhyme, and iambic pentameter is so rhythmic.    It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve done a play where people are tweeting me about it    Were you a fan of Russell T Davies\u2019s work before?He\u2019s a fantastic talent. I watched Cucumber, Banana and Tofu last year and thought, Wow, I\u2019d love to work with him. He\u2019s got a smart, fresh way of thinking about TV. He was on set every day, constantly creating new things to bring to it. Snug does lots of lion roaring. Did you go to the zoo for research?I did visit London zoo but didn\u2019t see any lions. Luckily, YouTube exists. You play one of the rude mechanicals in the play, alongside Richard Wilson and Matt Lucas. How was it working with them?One Foot in the Grave was one of the shows that made me want to get into comedy and I was a big fan of Little Britain, so it was surreal to be working with them. I made sure I didn\u2019t do their catchphrases at them, although I was tempted. Me and Matt are both Arsenal fans, so that was the icebreaker. Maxine Peake has a strong look as the fairy queen Titania\u2026Yeah, a mohawk with tattoos on the sides of her head. She might have looked fierce but was one of the kindest, friendliest people. And Elaine Paige plays Mistress Quince. Surely she gets to sing?Of course she does. We got her to sing all the time on set. \u201cCome on, girl, when are you gonna start singing?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a break \u2013 go on, quick song.\u201d   Related: Have you been watching \u2026 PhoneShop?    You\u2019re starring in The Suicide at the National Theatre. How\u2019s it going?Tell you what I\u2019m stoked about: it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve done a play where people are tweeting me about it \u2013 posting their opinions or sneaky pics. It\u2019s great that a young audience are talking about theatre on Twitter in the way they talk about TV. It\u2019s the TV Baftas next Sunday. Been practising your gallant loser face just in case?I\u2019ve already perfected it. I start clapping and a gracious smile comes naturally. Look out for it on the TV. Presumably there\u2019ll be a second series of your sketch show?Hope so, we\u2019re waiting to find out. It\u2019d be a bit weird if we got Bafta nominated then didn\u2019t get recommissioned: \u201cSorry guys, well done but bye.\u201d Finally, were you affected by the death\u00a0of your namesake Prince last\u00a0week?Oh my gosh, completely. He was an icon for me growing up. I was living in a council house in the middle of nowhere and he brought magic into my life. Diamonds and Pearls was one of my first cassettes and I played it so much, I wore it out and glued it back together with nail varnish. Prince stood on his own. He inspired people to create stuff. He made the world a better place. A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream will be\u00a0broadcast on BBC1 later this month",
