  "body": "A Baltimore man has been exonerated after spending 17 years in prison for a murder that new DNA evidence shows he did not commit. Malcolm Jabbar Bryant was arrested in 1998 when a single eyewitness identified him as the man who stabbed 16-year-old Toni Barksdale to death. Bryant and his family always maintained his innocence. Bryant eventually exhausted all of his appeals and tried several different post-conviction procedures. Michele Nethercott, of the University of Baltimore\u2019s Innocence Project, took up Bryant\u2019s case eight years ago and eventually obtained court orders to test the victim\u2019s fingernail clippings and T-shirt for DNA, which happened to have a rare identifier that was not consistent with Bryant\u2019s. \u201cThe DNA is in fact the killer\u2019s DNA and the DNA does not match Malcolm Bryant,\u201d said Laura Lipscomb, the head of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office of conviction integrity, in a court proceeding on Wednesday. When Lipscomb said the state would join Bryant\u2019s attorney in asking for a new trial and indicated that the state would not bring charges on any of the counts against Bryant, someone in the courtroom yelled: \u201cHallelujah.\u201d Bryant, who will not be released from prison until later in the week, rubbed his face as he was led from the courtroom, still in chains. \u201cIt\u2019s been a horror,\u201d said Annie Bryant, his mother, outside the courtroom. \u201cI\u2019m overjoyed.\u201d In a press conference following the court proceeding, state\u2019s attorney Marilyn Mosby stood with Nethercott, Lipscomb, the police commissioner, Kevin Davis, and several investigators. \u201cOn behalf of the criminal justice system, I\u2019d like to apologize,\u201d she said. Mosby also addressed the family of the victim, which \u201cchose to embrace today\u2019s outcome with an open heart and an open mind\u201d. \u201cTheir daughter is not forgotten,\u201d she said, promising to work with the police department to find Barksdale\u2019s killer. She also pledged that her office\u2019s conviction integrity unit would continue to review \u201cevery petition of innocence\u201d.",
