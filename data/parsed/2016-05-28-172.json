Since Helen\u2019s funeral, I\u2019ve been digging out a routine for Millie and Matt from the rubble of a domestic happiness all but flattened by their mother\u2019s death. It\u2019s not my employers who are the problem \u2013 they have been great. Nor is it because I think everyone will be watching me \u2013 very few colleagues know that she is dead. From Helen\u2019s bedside, I\u2019d lobbied human resources\u00a0for the news of her death to be kept quiet. Ivan, who works in HR, got the plot quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell only the senior team to explain your absence. There will be no general awareness of your situation. You do realise, though, that this means people will be insensitive to the rawness of it all for you. You\u2019ll need a thick skin,\u201d he added. Fair warning, but a rhino hide seems a reasonable trade-off for being spared the awkwardness of \u201cI\u2019m so sorry \u2026\u201d exchanges and to avoid seeing the fear in people\u2019s eyes that I might blub like a\u00a0baby.

This includes Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, who returned to work 10 days after her husband\u2019s unexpected death. I respect so much of what she has written but, God, she must love her job. For me, I\u00a0sense there\u2019s been a recalibration in what I give a toss about, which does not include some of the pain, politics and arse-covering required to succeed in my media-related industry. It might be easier were I a doctor, where the scale of importance of saving lives would meet my narrower definition of what now matters. There were signs, even from the morning of Helen\u2019s death, that the tectonic plates of my worldview had shifted. It was 7am and I was en route back from the hospital to be home when Millie and Matt woke. I\u2019d be waiting to tell them the dreadful news and, in doing so, lower but hopefully not bring crashing down the curtain of their childhood. Emotionally and physically exhausted after a long night in Helen\u2019s room, I needed to bolster myself. Seeing a coffee shop open as I\u00a0entered town, I\u2019d pulled over for refreshment. Parked outside the bank, I\u2019d sprawled across the car\u2019s back seat, the privacy glass of the rear windows making me invisible to the world. An Audi sports car pulled up and, leaving his engine running and door open, a suited figure of about 35 got out and put his card into the nearest cashpoint. Minutes passed and, despite it being 7am so a bit early for a meltdown, he started swearing angrily. The machine had only eaten his card, but he was behaving like Gordon Ramsay served with a rotten oyster, but without the blessing of the overdubbed beeps.   Related: The week after my wife\u2019s death    I felt a gush of burning anger that he should behave that way for so small an inconvenience, given what I was facing, and in a mad departure from the middle-class book of law-abiding etiquette, I wanted to jump in and steal his car. That would really have given him something to swear about, as I found out how well that big engine got the rubber on the road. The moment passed, he drove off and I was still fit to be a member of civilised middle-class society. Fate, however, had not finished with me. From around the corner came a much older man, furtive and conspicuous; a present-day version of George Cole\u2019s Flash Harry from St Trinian\u2019s, peering up and down the empty road. He stopped before the cashpoint only four feet from my hidden vantage. Seeing no one about, he started to remove something from the cashpoint. I\u2019m stunned. It\u2019s a sting in which the potty-mouthed Audi man\u2019s cashcard had been cloned. That would really give him something to swear about. The previous day, I would have been photographing this scene, calling the police or even wading in, but that day \u2013 and maybe for ever \u2013 I did not budge. What this means for work I\u2019m not yet sure, but it\u2019s likely to be trickier than I imagined \u2013 my lens on the world has shifted from compliance (with an occasional wildcard moment) to something more intolerant of my time being overloaded with inconsequential pap. If only I\u2019d pleased my mum and become a surgeon. Adam Golightly is a pseudonym",
