The attacks came from Andrew Bridgen and Nadine Dorries \u2013 both Brexiters, and longstanding, publicity-hungry opponents of the prime minister \u2013 and their claim that even winning the EU referendum won\u2019t stop Cameron facing a leadership challenge in the summer was dismissed by fellow Tories. But their comments coincided with the ministers in charge of the leave campaign launching some of their strongest personal attacks yet on Cameron, prompting Labour\u2019s Alan Johnson to say that the Tory infighting was getting \u201cvery ugly indeed\u201d. Bridgen told the BBC\u2019s 5 Live that Cameron had been making \u201coutrageous\u201d claims in his bid to persuade voters to back remain and that, as a consequence, he had effectively lost his parliamentary majority.   Related: Conservative rift over EU risks widening as attacks on David Cameron intensify    \u201cThe party is fairly fractured, straight down the middle and I don\u2019t know which character could possibly pull it back together going forward for an effective government. I honestly think we probably need to go for a general election before Christmas and get a new mandate from the people,\u201d he said. Bridgen said at least 50 Tory MPs \u2013 the number needed to call a confidence vote \u2013 felt the same way about Cameron and that a vote on the prime minister\u2019s future was \u201cprobably highly likely\u201d after the referendum. Dorries told ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday she had already submitted her letter to the chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee expressing no confidence in the prime minister. \u201c[Cameron] has lied profoundly, and I think that is actually really at the heart of why Conservative MPs have been so angered. To say that Turkey is not going to join the European Union as far as 30 years is a lie.\u201d A leadership contest would only take place if Cameron lost a confidence vote, which would be unlikely if the remain campaign wins the referendum. But a sizeable vote against Cameron in a confidence ballot could still prove fatal to his premiership, forcing him to accelerate plans for his departure.  Dorries said that if remain won 60/40, Cameron would probably survive. \u201cIf remain win by a narrow majority, or if leave win, he\u2019s toast within days,\u201d she said. Even if, as many Tories expect, a confidence vote does not materialise, the Bridgen/Dorries comments are a reminder of how maverick, hardline Eurosceptics were able to play havoc with John Major\u2019s government in the 1990s because he had such a small majority. Cameron\u2019s working majority is just 16. The Conservative MP Steve Baker said Bridgen \u201c[had] a point\u201d about how unsympathetic backbenchers were towards Cameron\u2019s EU stance. Baker claimed only about 30 were very strongly committed to remain \u2013 and he said he thought there could be \u201ca problem\u201d for the prime minister after 23 June. But more senior figures in Tory Brexit camp backed Cameron and insisted a confidence vote would not happen because the rebels would not get enough support. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are 50 colleagues gunning for the prime minister,\u201d said Chris Grayling, the justice secretary. \u201cI can assure you that those people who fought to win their seats 12 months ago are definitely not gunning for a general election by Christmas.\u201d Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee, said Bridgen\u2019s intervention was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and that the party had to pull together after the referendum. Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, said the party would need \u201ca period of stability\u201d after the referendum and that it would be best for Cameron to stay as prime minister. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, also said he was not in favour of replacing Cameron. In a particularly personal attack that seemed clearly aimed at Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, Priti Patel, the employment minister, used an article in the Sunday Telegraph to say it was \u201cshameful\u201d that wealthy remain campaigners did not realise how much harm mass immigration was doing to the poor. \u201cIf you have private wealth or if you work for Goldman Sachs you\u2019ll be fine. But when public services are under pressure, it is those people who do not have the luxury of being able to afford the alternatives who are most vulnerable,\u201d she wrote.  \u201cIt\u2019s shameful that those leading the pro-EU campaign fail to care for those who do not have their advantages.\u201d Patel\u2019s article coincided with Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, and Michael Gove, the justice secretary, writing an open letter to Cameron asking him to accept that it would be impossible for him to achieve his manifesto promise of getting net migration below 100,000 if the UK stayed in the EU. The letter, also signed by Labour\u2019s Gisela Stuart, said failure to keep this promise \u201cis corrosive of public trust\u201d. A source close to Cameron said that there was now overwhelming evidence, backed up by Sunday\u2019s Observer survey of economists, that leaving the EU would cause a \u201cserious economic shock\u201d and that \u201cthe suggestion that crashing your economy is the best way of dealing with immigration is clearly nonsense\u201d. Commenting on the Tory turmoil, Alan Johnson, chair of Labour In for Britain, said: \u201cWhat is extraordinary is the vindictiveness and nastiness we are seeing within the Conservative party and Conservative cabinet. I think it\u2019s very ugly, very ugly indeed. If those are David Cameron\u2019s friends and allies, he\u2019s welcome to them.\u201d     Andrew Bridgen MP Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    Andrew Bridgen profile Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire since 2010, has form as a critic of David Cameron\u2019s. In 2013 he publicly admitted that he had sent a letter to the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee calling for a vote of confidence in his leader. Explaining his decision in a newspaper article, he said there was a \u201ccredibility problem\u201d with Cameron. \u201cThe voters think we have many of the right messages \u2013 they just don\u2019t believe the messenger. In some cases, the messages are wrong or badly handled. By pressing ahead with gay marriage and delaying a promise on an EU referendum until he was forced to do so, Mr Cameron has fuelled the rise of Ukip. We have created our own nemesis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think the situation is this: it\u2019s like being in an aeroplane. The pilot doesn\u2019t know how to land it. We can either do something about it before the crash, or sit back, watch the in-flight movies and wait for the inevitable.\u201d At the time Bridgen was one of only two Tory MPs known to have written a letter calling for a confidence vote. The other, Patrick Mercer, resigned after a lobbying scandal. A year later Bridgen wrote an open letter to Cameron formally withdrawing his letter calling for a confidence vote, and offering Cameron his \u201cfull and enthusiastic support\u201d. Explaining his volte-face, he said much had happened in the meantime.",
