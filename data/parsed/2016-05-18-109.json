  "body": "With a historically high unfavorability rating, Hillary Clinton needs a side-kick who can help her broaden her appeal to voters.  Names have been bubbling up for months now. Will she bolster her progressive credentials by selecting Elizabeth Warren or even, against all odds, Bernie Sanders? Will she seek to appeal to Latino voters by nominating a candidate like Julian Castro or Tom Perez? Or might she go after swing-state senators like Sherrod Brown? Vice-presidents often play the attack dog on campaign trails and, with an opponent like Donald Trump, she could do with a feisty VP who can pack some punches. So, while Hillary Clinton will have her own favorites, we\u2019d love to hear yours. Please fill in the form below and tell us who you want to see as her pick \u2013 and why.  Thank you for your submissions! The form is now closed: A selection of your choices have been published here.",
