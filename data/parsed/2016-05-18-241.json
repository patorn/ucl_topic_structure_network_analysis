Rachel Davis, a 21-year-old linguistics student at University College London, has tried this technique in new situations with unfamiliar people. \u201cI try and become a cool, cynical, full-of-quips persona \u2013 an extra lively can-do exaggerated caricature of myself,\u201d she says. But Davis feels this behaviour can be problematic as when she confides in new friends about social anxiety, they don\u2019t believe her. \u201cOccasionally the confidence I\u2019ve projected prevents me from seeking the help I eventually end up needing,\u201d she says.  However, Ruby Andrews, a 22-year-old student at Chelsea School of Art, believes that faking confidence is \u201ca necessary skill, particularly when you\u2019re young and living in London\u201d. She explains: \u201cIn the capital you have to be strong or you\u2019ll sink. I\u2019m not someone who flourishes when I\u2019m out of my comfort zone, so faking it has helped me feel more confident and capable, even when inside I feel scared.\u201d  Confidence coach Jo Emerson says she prefers the phrase \u201cact as if\u201d to \u201cfake it til you make it\u201d. \u201cActing \u2018as if\u2019 means you consider what qualities you would like to embody as a confident version of you \u2013 your best self \u2013 and then start acting in ways that echo this. For example, you might think your best self would smile at everyone you meet, in which case this is what you need to practice until it becomes second nature.\u201d Here are six areas where you can use this method to boost your confidence. 1. Adjust your body language Both Davis and Andrews feel conscious of body language: Davis says she fidgets and Andrews tries to avoid tucking her hands in her sleeves as it could suggest a lack of confidence.  Tweaking your posture just a little bit so that you are making yourself bigger rather than smaller can \u201csignificantly change how your life unfolds\u201d says Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy in her popular TED talk about what the way we position our bodies communicates to other people, and to ourselves.

Consider your tone of voice Speaking quietly, not saying much or hesitating while you speak all betray a lack of confidence. Emerson suggests recording yourself speaking to get over self-consciousness about your voice. \u201cThis often takes several play backs,\u201d she says. \u201cThen ask yourself how you might improve the way you speak. This often means slowing down and breathing between sentences. The more you can relax and be yourself with your voice, the better you will come across.\u201d Anne Walsh, vocal coach at Confidently Speaking, says that during stressful times like interviews or presentations, \u201cwe breathe high into our upper chest areas through fear and tension and this interferes with our capacity to connect breathing to speaking effectively.\u201d She advises her clients to breath deeply because it allows your voice to be \u201copen, warm and resonant\u201d. Walsh adds: \u201cThese techniques are simple to learn and can be practiced regularly until they feel natural. Confidence is created by a relaxed, open body posture, low, easy breathing and a warm, resonant vocal tone. These aren\u2019t necessarily natural states for some of us, but they can be consciously learned, practiced and applied in situations that count.\u201d  3. Make eye contact Emerson says looking people in the eye and smiling really help to build confidence. Andrews says she\u2019s noticed that she tends to walk around with her head down, but notices that when she looks up, making eye contact with strangers \u201ccan be a positive and self-assuring experience\u201d.

Change the way you think \u201cIf you have low confidence you are likely believing a very negative, critical voice in your mind,\u201d says Emerson. \u201cThe key to boosting your self esteem is to start questioning this voice and replacing what it says with positive, wise, loving self-talk.\u201d \u201cI definitely think negative thoughts impede my confidence,\u201d says Andrews. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that when I doubt myself I perform less well.\u201d She says talking to friends and family about what is worrying her helps to offload the anxiety.  \u201cNegativity definitely impacts both my concentration and my creativity,\u201d she adds. Davis tries to distract herself from negative thoughts by thinking about the good things she has going for her \u2013 friends, hobbies, boyfriends, even animals and foods she likes. 5. Dress in a way that makes you feel good University professor and author of Mind What You Wear Karen Pine did an experiment where she dressed students in Superman costumes. She found they were more confident than the control group. \u201cDressing for success really does work,\u201d she says. \u201cNot only does dressing smart make you feel confident, research suggests that you will behave more confidently too.\u201d Emerson says clean, ironed clothes that suit you are important for confidence. \u201cThe way I dress has changed hugely since I was a student,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I had no confidence in my twenties I copied what I saw other girls wearing and hated those clothes on my body. I think the way we dress has a huge bearing on our confidence. We feel good about ourselves if we make an effort with the way we dress. This isn\u2019t about fashion or size, more about wearing clean, ironed clothes that suit you.\u201d   Related: Wish you were more confident at uni? Six myths are stopping you    Andrews did a foundation year at world-famous fashion school Central Saint Martins and says that going to university felt like a runway show. \u201cI was aware of how confident and proud everyone seemed,\u201d she says. \u201cLooking back I think some people stood out, but they were actually a minority. I notice when I wear something that I feel more comfortable in. When I dress lazily or in something that I think doesn\u2019t flatter me, I spend time thinking about this and it distracts me.\u201d  Davis says she feels best when she\u2019s true to her style. \u201cI like stretch fit or loose fit clothing,\u201d she says. \u201cStiff smart clothing makes me either really confident or super uncomfortable. If I get anxious, or sweat, I get more anxious and sweat more. But if I feel a bit confident then a well-fitting smart outfit exponentially increases that.\u201d 6. And the rest... Davis says she can feel more confident if she stands out. \u201cIf I have something to show off that makes me seem extra well put together \u2013 such as nails or make-up \u2013 I feel more confident,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, recently I\u2019m discovering how to apply the state of mind without needing the external stimuli. I am learning to make myself feel comfortable simply by reading the situation, avoiding negative vibes and identifying people I can relate to.\u201d Andrews says exercising makes her feel confident, and so does receiving praise. \u201cI feel confident when I receive an unexpected compliment from someone I don\u2019t know particularly well,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I try and praise those around me on little things in the hope that they too feel more sure of themselves as a result.\u201d Emerson\u2019s top three tips for boosting confidence:  Stop comparing yourself to other people, as it only leads to low self-esteem.  Understand that confidence is like a muscle and you need to work on it to maintain it.  Practice mindfulness \u2013 it\u2019s the best antidote to stress, which causes anxiety and low confidence.
