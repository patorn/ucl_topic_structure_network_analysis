Jews, they say, are extremely sensitive on the issue. That\u2019s what the antisemites have been saying for years, even when the Blackshirt leader Sir Oswald Mosley was spouting venom that makes Ken Livingstone look like a paragon of all virtues. It was an old disease even then \u2013 which was why more Jews weren\u2019t allowed refuge here from Nazism. Thirty years before the British fascists marched through the East End, a government minister said immigrant Jews had too many strange habits and hinted that perhaps they didn\u2019t wash frequently enough. Anyway, the fact had to be faced, they didn\u2019t fit in, and schools and golf club were happy to agree. I could have said that I have never experienced that kind of prejudice. For that and so many other reasons, I love Britain. It has always been my home and I am so grateful it has. Yet, an old adage does come to mind. Sticks and stones, they say, could break bones but names will never hurt. But actually, they do.

It didn\u2019t take more than a minute for him to rise from his desk, put his arms around me and say, \u201dMike, I\u2019m so sorry. Please forgive me.\u201d I never forgot that. At Luton grammar school, just a few years before, there had been more serious incidents. No, not with other pupils, but with teachers. I remember as vividly as last night\u2019s dinner, the swish of the maths master\u2019s gown as he moved towards me in the middle of a lesson. I suppose I had been talking. The swish was followed by a sudden crash around my left ear. Bad enough, yes. Sensitive? Yes. With reason, for as the master\u2019s hand went back in his pocket, he uttered the immortal words, \u201cI suppose you are now going to start snivelling. You people always do.\u201d My people, I suppose, had snivelled on the road to Auschwitz. And then there was the careers master who asked us what we wanted to do when we left school. Ridiculously, I said I fancied trying for the diplomatic service. He looked at me \u2013 and laughed. Out loud. Perhaps I was just sensitive, but I knew \u2013 yes, I knew what he meant. I once was offered a job on the old Daily Herald newspaper. My father took it every day, so it was part of my life. I desperately wanted that job. Just as I was about to shake the news editor\u2019s hand, he said: \u201cJust one point. You\u2019ll have to change your name. I have too many Jewish bylines already. You see what I mean.\u201d I saw what he meant, and in a gesture of integrity of which I am still proud, I told him what he could do with his job. Long after that, I was a regular contributor to a programme on the BBC World Service. I loved working for that programme. The producer and I had become friends. Then she left and another producer took over. I did a piece for him. He said he didn\u2019t like it and apparently didn\u2019t like me much, either. There would be no more work for that programme. A clash of personalities, I reckoned. Until that is, three other contributors had similar clashes with their personalities. They were good broadcasters and journalists. They had two other things in common. All were very nice people. All were Jews. Then there was a very slight argument \u2013 or so I thought \u2013 with the head of another enterprise in which I was involved. Suddenly out of this man\u2019s mouth, came: \u201dIt\u2019s your arrogance, I don\u2019t like. Your Jewish arrogance.\u201d I told the man that the remark wasn\u2019t worthy of him. He apologised. But he had said it.

My wife, Sara, who was a kind, well mannered considerate soul, and I were in the queue behind a well-dressed woman with a child. She had completed her transaction, her trolley was empty and she was deep in conversation with the checkout girl who was telling her about her boyfriend. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d Sara said, \u201care you going to be long?\u201d The woman cast her eyes in our direction and spewed out: \u201cLook at them. They\u2019re pigs! That\u2019s why they put them in the ovens. That\u2019s what you do with pigs.\u201d I froze. For once, I was short of words. All I could think of was that she had one thing in her favour: she wasn\u2019t a Holocaust denier. That, though, of course, is another sad story. None of this makes me love this country (my country) any less. I have enjoyed all its freedoms and privileges and have tried to make what contributions I can without, I suppose, thinking too much about them. On Thursday, I will exercise my right to vote for my local council \u2013 worrying only about what is good for Bournemouth. And I never forget that I have dear friends without an antisemitic bone in their bodies. So is everything now fine then, personally speaking? Not quite. I suppose it must be like having occasional surgery. The operations are done, the desired results achieved. But each one leaves a scar \u2013 and perhaps the very occasional, if irrational, fear that it might open up again. As the old Yiddish saying goes, \u201cit\u2019s not easy being a Jew\u201d.",
