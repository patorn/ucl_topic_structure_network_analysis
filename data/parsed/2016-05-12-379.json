  "body": "The government will need to pass legislation to exempt its new work experience scheme from the Fair Work Act or pay young jobseekers the minimum wage, unions lawyers have said. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has received legal advice that it claims shows the program is \u201cillegal\u201d, but will not release the full advice. In the 3 May budget the government unveiled the PaTH internship scheme, in which interns will receive $100 a week on top of their welfare payments to undertake up to 12 weeks of work experience. Unions have complained that PaTH interns working 25 hours a week would receive $364 a week. That is $68 below the minimum wage and represents just a $4-an-hour improvement on the dole.   Related: Turnbull targets Labor's 'shameful' opposition to youth work experience plan    On Thursday ACTU president Ged Kearney said interns would be \u201cdoing work that is productive, under direct supervision of an employer, and they are getting paid for it, albeit an amount below minimum wage\u201d.  \u201cOur legal advice is that that adds up to an employment relationship \u2013 they should be protected under the Fair Work Act.\u201d The scheme \u201cis in fact or can be seen as illegal\u201d, Kearney said. She said the scheme would have jobseekers working alongside employees \u201cdoing the exact same job for the minimum wage\u201d, such as working in supermarkets. The Maurice Blackburn Lawyers principal Kamal Farouque who provided the advice to the ACTU, told Guardian Australia it is \u201clikely that in the ordinary course the interns will be employees, entitled to minimum rates of pay and other conditions under the Fair Work Act\u201d, for the reasons Kearney explained. There are a number of welfare programs which involve work that are exempted by legislation from the Fair Work Act, including minimum wage requirements, such as the Green Army and the Community Development Program. At Senate estimates on Friday employment department officials said the internship program would not have to meet minimum wage laws because payments to interns were \u201cnot a wage, it\u2019s not an hourly rate, it\u2019s an incentive payment to participate in an internship\u201d.   Related: Youth intern scheme has no limits on numbers, hours and jobs, Senate told    The comments confirm the scheme will be structured so that it is not technically employment, but rather a welfare program.  The government plans to legislate for the program through amendments to the Social Security Act, setting up the $100 incentive payments. Social security legislation stipulates jobseekers are not employees for the purpose of the Fair Work Act. Farouque said \u201cthe government might well be looking to pass specific legislation to deal with and carve out PaTH scheme [so that interns are not] regarded as employees\u201d.  \u201cThey might do that, but like anything that would need to get through parliament. \u201cClearly the scheme at the moment and the way it was presented was a budget thought bubble. The parameters of the program are unknown.\u201d On Thursday, Malcolm Turnbull said claims the program was illegal were \u201cbaseless\u201d and repeated his statements it was \u201cshameful\u201d Labor that opposed it. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said \u201clegal advice from the Department of Employment confirms that Youth for Jobs PaTH fully complies with the law\u201d. \u201cLabor parliamentarians and the unions are happy to use interns themselves so it beggars belief that they are opposed to the PaTH program,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of supporting good policy, Bill Shorten and his union mates would rather confine tens of thousands of vulnerable young Australians to long-term unemployment and welfare.\u201d The Greens community services spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, said \u201cthe $4-per-hour intern scheme could be a breach of minimum wage standards, is wide open to exploitation and would struggle in a future Senate if the Coalition were to pursue it post-election\u201d. \u201cEstimates last week exposed a variety of concerns with this approach, this scheme is wide open to youth exploitation that could set back young people. Youth unemployment should not be used as an excuse to provide a cheap labour source for business.\u201d",
