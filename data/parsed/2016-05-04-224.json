  "body": "Perhaps it takes the diplomatic neutrality of an international pulse organisation to deal with the global falafel feud. The subject of who \u201cowns\u201d these savoury fried delights has been consuming the Middle East for many years \u2013 part of the wider politics of who stole what from whom, and on par with the notorious hummus wars. However, the pulse people aren\u2019t taking sides \u2013 they are just pushing the pulses. To which end, the Global Pulse Federation (yes, I checked, it\u2019s real) hosted the inaugural London falafel festival at Borough market last Sunday, as part of what the UN has decreed to be the International Year of Pulses (again, yes). It\u2019s all about the pulses as a force for good \u2013 a nutritious, sustainable and affordable good, to be more precise. Daniel Young, the food critic and writer who hosted the event, says that falafels, while potentially healthy, are now in the category of \u201cdude food\u201d \u2013 like tacos, cheese burgers or fried chicken, they are all about moreish, tasty, non-virtuous eating. \u201cImpulse food, instant excitement,\u201d he says. I\u2019m not sure about this claim, but falafels have been wildly popular across the Middle East for some time. I\u2019m often amused at the speed with which two people from that region, discussing travels to Beirut, say, or to Cairo, get on to the pressing matter of where to find the best falafel.   Related: How to cook the perfect falafel    Competing for the title of falafel champions at Borough market are representatives of various styles, although unfortunately the Lebanese team were refused visas. But there is the Egyptian chef Moustafa Elrefaey from the Cairo chain Zooba, alongside the Israeli offering from Uri Dinay of Pilpel, which has four branches in London. There are also variations from two London-based chefs, the Palestinian-Lebanese Rasheed Muhammed of Hoxton Beach, and Abdullah Amin of Origin Of, who brings a fusion falafel.

Photograph: Alecsandra Dragoi for the Guardian    The event is sold out \u2013 meaning that the four competitors are each serving up some 500 falafel plates \u2013 but that\u2019s hardly a surprise. Long-suffering falafel fans have seen their favourite food eroded by dubious aberrations and bland supermarket versions, so the chance to enjoy four authentic, fresh street-food samples has obvious appeal. And there are plenty of non-aligned, straight-up foodies here \u2013 avowed carnivores, even \u2013 patiently joining the long queues to taste each stall\u2019s offering. The fusion version from Origin Of is creative and has a great consistency, but with a three-bean mix sprinkled with two different seeds and served with three dips, there is perhaps too much going on. Pilpil goes full Israeli style, crisp but slightly dense chickpea balls stuffed into pitta bread with fresh salads, pickles and sauces. Hoxton Beach has perfectly crumbly but somehow bland falafel balls smashed into a wrap along with salads, tahini and an incredible, freshly made, Iraqi-style mango pickle. I am not an unbiased observer. I was raised on falafels comprising a 50/50 fava bean/chickpea mix, made by my Iraqi-born mother who lived in Israel. But I\u2019m a falafel fundamentalist and think the Egyptian variety is clearly the king of falafels. I took precautions to avoid unjustifiable support for the Egyptian team, visiting their stall last after filling myself with all the other falafels first (the purity of research is hard). But even then, theirs just killed it. Made with ground-on-the-spot fava beans, leeks, fresh coriander and spices, and stuffed with smoky aubergine, this falafel is light and delicate and delicious. And it wins the overall competition, closely followed by the falafel from Pilpel. Elrefaey, the chef from Zooba (and a culinary ambassador for Egypt), is grinning from ear to ear while frying the falafel. \u201cI don\u2019t think falafel is Egyptian,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI know it is.\u201d His offering, he says, is an \u201cauthentic, classic recipe, with a tweak\u201d. When I speak to Dinay, who runs Pilpel, he is gracious about the whole thing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t invent falafel,\u201d he says, referring to Israeli attempts to claim the food as its own. He tells me that, on a plate, the Egyptian competitors were the best, hands down.     Zooba\u2019s winning falafel offering. Photograph: Alecsandra Dragoi for the Guardian    It\u2019s most likely that falafel did start in Egypt \u2013 one theory being that Coptic Christians created it about 1,000 years ago, another being that it goes back to the time of the pharaohs. In any case, the dish migrated to the Levant, to be consumed by Lebanese, Palestinians and Israelis \u2013 and all those countries have at some point claimed falafel as their national dish. Arguments about origins aside, most people just want to eat the best falafel that can be found. Anissa Helou, the Middle East food expert and writer, tells me what to look out for. \u201cThey have to be very crisp on the outside, with a nice crust that is not too dark,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd \u2013 this is the art of proper frying \u2013 they should be crumbly and fluffy, without being too wet on the inside.\u201d When it comes to consistency as well as flavour, the ingredients are key: Helou suggests a good mix would be chickpeas and fava beans, along with fresh coriander, leeks, garlic and spices, and a bit of bicarbonate of soda added at the end, so that the falafel balls puff up when fried. What is essential, though, is that they are served on the spot. As Young says: \u201cIt\u2019s better to have people wait for the falafel, than to have the falafel wait for people.\u201d Bear that in mind whenever you\u2019re remotely tempted by some pre-packaged, refrigerated fried bean balls masquerading as this champion Middle Eastern food.

Add the salt and cumin until the mix is slightly foamy. Heat the oil to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and, if you have one, use an ice-cream scoop to form a ball from the puree.
