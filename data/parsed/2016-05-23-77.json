  "body": "When to prick out and when to pinch out, what to dead-head and what to mulch \u2013 the Royal Horticultural Society says a whole \u201clost generation\u201d of people in their 20s and 30s have no idea when it comes to gardening. It has led to back gardens suppressed by decking, front gardens concreted over and used to park the car. \u201cFor a lot of them, their parents just didn\u2019t teach them gardening and we lost a lot of the skills,\u201d Sue Biggs, director-general of the RHS, told the Times. But she also blamed the rise of buy-to-let and the housing crisis, which has made it harder for younger people to buy their own homes, and so literally to put down roots. So how can millennials get involved? Two experts advise: Have patience \u201cThe modern world expects instant results, and gardening isn\u2019t about instant results,\u201d says Christine Walkden, the horticulturalist and presenter of the BBC series Christine\u2019s Garden. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing in the modern world that you\u2019re not going to change with the biggest computer.\u201d But a little bit of instant(ish) gratification works wonders   \u201cIf you\u2019re growing food, tomatoes are brilliant: the seeds germinate easily, they always fruit,\u201d says Frances Tophill, a presenter of ITV\u2019s Love Your Garden and the author of First Time Gardener. \u201cIf you\u2019re growing flowers, start with annuals, because you\u2019re guaranteed to get a nice display that year, and then move on to perennials, which take it to another level of winter care.\u201d Start small   \u201cIf you overwhelm yourself by doing something really complicated, it gets on top of you,\u201d says Tophill. \u201cThen, if you let it get behind, it becomes stressful. Start with something you know you can cope with. If you have a window box, grow three herbs you know you have time to tend. Slowly build up. If you have a confidence knock, and all the things you\u2019ve tried to grow have died, then it can stop you having any incentive to do it next year.\u201d   Related: Gardens: tomato cuttings that\u2019ll shoot up    Do your research   \u201cChoose plants that you know grow in your area \u2013 walk down the street and look at what your neighbours have,\u201d says Tophill. \u201cThere are lots of \u2018right plant, right place\u2019 books. Work out what sort of soil you have, how much sun and wind, and choose things that will grow in that space: they will take care of themselves.\u201d Gardening is a learning process, says Walkden: \u201cYou had to be taught how to read, how to drive a car; people seem to think that with gardening you just put it in and it grows.\u201d Garden anywhere   A garden is a luxury completely alien to many urban twenty somethings, but as well as houseplants, any outside space will work. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a doorstep, you can have a pot,\u201d says Walkden. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a windowsill, you can have a window box. You can have containers screwed to the wall.\u201d And don\u2019t let renting put you off   You don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money to make your garden look better. \u201cMow the lawn, put down some wild flower seeds,\u201d says Tophill. \u201cYou can make a living wall using a wooden pallet \u2013 bolt it to the wall, fill it with liner and compost and grow all kinds of things. It\u2019s so cheap that even if you don\u2019t end up taking it with you it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Mainly though, she says, \u201cgrow things in containers so when you move you can take them with you.\u201d Don\u2019t give up   \u201cTry, and if it doesn\u2019t work, try again, because at some stage it will,\u201d says Walkden. \u201cNever give up on the first try. Sow, sow, sow again. Don\u2019t be intimidated. There\u2019s always next season if you do cock it up.\u201d Failing that, get your parents round.",
