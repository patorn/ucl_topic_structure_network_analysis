Ballydoyle, who had been odds-on for Sunday\u2019s race after finishing second to her stablemate at Newmarket, will miss the race after her trainer revealed that the filly\u2019s blood wasn\u2019t 100% in a scope test this week. Speaking to the Racing Post on Friday morning, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to declare Minding for the Tattersalls Irish 1,000 Guineas but Ballydoyle\u2019s blood picture wasn\u2019t 100% right this morning and she won\u2019t be declared.\u201d He added: \u201cVancouver, who was due to have his first run since joining us from Australia in the Group Two Greenlands Stakes at The Curragh on Saturday, will also miss his race as we weren\u2019t happy with his bloods when we checked out our weekend runners this morning. It\u2019s unfortunate as we were keen to run him with Royal Ascot in mind.\u201d O\u2019Brien had previously been planning to head straight to the Oaks with Minding, and the Epsom Classic remains the target for the impressive 1,000 Guineas winner. Minding will be joined in her Irish 1,000 Guineas bid by Coolmore, Pretty Perfect and Californiadreaming from the O\u2019Brien camp. Friday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood   Related: Horse racing tips: Friday 20 May    Just four runners go to post for the Cocked Hat Stakes at Goodwood this afternoon, but two are still engaged in the Derby and Prize Money (3.30) in particular could yet emerge as a late outside bet for the Classic. Saeed bin Suroor\u2019s colt has had just two starts to date, the first in a Newmarket maiden last October and the next in a handicap at the same course on 1,000 Guineas day earlier this month. Prize Money could finish only a half-length second there, which is not an obvious portent of Classic potential, but he was giving 8lb to Taqdeer, the winner, in a race that often proves to be one of the strongest three-year-old handicaps all season. The time of the race was also noticeably strong - a match for Wings Of Desire\u2019s performance when winning the Dante according to Timeform - and John Ferguson, Godolphin\u2019s chief executive, made it clear on Thursday that Prize Money is likely to take up his Derby engagement if he wins impressively today. On that basis, the 50-1 for Epsom available on a \u201cnon-runner, no bet\u201d basis with a couple of firms could be worth a small interest. Elsewhere on the card, the seven runner fillies\u2019 handicap boils down to three realistic contenders with Aristocratic (2.55) a fair price to beat Persuasive, who is in the same ownership. Parnells Dream (4.00) is another to catch the eye on the same card, while at Haydock this evening, Double Up (7.30) still has scope for further progress and can take an interesting race for the Listed Achilles Stakes at around 7-2. Tipping competition, day five Our winners so far: Monday Paling 3-1 Rusty Rocket 12-1 Gowanauthat 8-1 Tuesday Orion\u2019s Bow 4-1 Coto 5-1 Powerful Wind 14-1 Wednesday Maleficent Queen 3-1 Don Padeja 25-1 Almodovar 4-1 Thursday Skiffle 5-1 Pour La Victoire 9-1 Manson 12-1 And our leader is: Carol Keen +28 \u2026 who endured a winnerless Thursday, while melonk seized the opportunity to close up to +26, thanks to Pour La Victoire and Skiffle.
