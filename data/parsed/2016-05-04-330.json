  "body": "A couple of years ago, my colleagues and I conducted a study on decision-making in university partnerships. Our findings suggested that good university partnerships did not depend on rational management decisions so much as human emotion. Alongside Daphne Lipp and Philipp H\u00f6llermann, I looked at the reasons for selecting a partner university as well as the factors involved in partnerships that failed or were successful. Our feeling was that a university\u2019s management often claims to use purely rational methods in the selection of partner universities, as well as in keeping such partnerships running smoothly. Ultimately though, emotional factors can be extremely important, and they are not prioritised. The results of our study were clear. International collaborations were largely initiated on the basis of positive impressions, observed from a distance. Instead of recommendations, personal links or locations playing a significant part, institutions and study programmes with good reputations received far more attention from potential partner universities. Only after a partnership was established did this change. Suddenly, other factors defined whether a partnership was considered successful. Communication and personal links both on an academic and administrative level were crucial factors in 94.6% of successful and 74.3% of unsuccessful partnerships. As well as this, experience based on trust mattered, as did comparability (we do similar things) and compatibility (what you do adds to what I do).  The more similar study programmes and shared goals were and the more experience each institution had with each other, the better the chances for a long-lasting and successful collaboration or partnership. Finally, similar goals for the future were important in successful partnerships. Doesn\u2019t this sound familiar? Don\u2019t the same criteria also apply to human relationships? It seems that the relations between universities are quite similar to romantic alliances of individuals, based on emotions and influenced by emotion-based decisions to a much greater degree than many might assume. So should we approach collaborations between universities as individuals approach relationships? Individuals already act as agents on behalf of institutions to foster partnerships, after all. Perhaps we should go a step further and be more explicit about the human part of process of building partnerships between these elaborate institutions: likes and dislikes, attractions, emotions and feelings. So, what does this mean? Should collaboration meetings be held over romantic candlelit dinners? Should joint study programmes be announced as though they are birth announcements? Should international offices celebrate collaboration anniversaries with a mini-break to Paris? University relations are \u2013 or should be \u2013 based on the improvement of study programmes, on new research groups or economies of scale. Yet, ultimately, international university collaborations are influenced by emotions at different levels within administration and faculties.  It may therefore be prudent to give intuition and emotions due consideration when developing internationalisation strategies. Bringing together individuals from both institutions and fostering communication and a good working climate are basics for developing interest in the partner. While administrative staff appear to have limited influence in initiating partnerships, they play a crucial role in day-to-day cooperation. Establishing closer links on this level might have the most substantial effect in the long run. More importantly, if we look at our university partnerships the same way we look at relationships in our private lives, it may be easier to identify what we want and what we need. Are we looking for a one-night stand (a single joint application for a grant), a fling (regular joint projects), or a marriage (key partners)? Each type of relationship between humans needs communication, recognition of different degrees of experience, trust, and comparability as well as compatibility.  The more stable the partnership is considered to be, the more similar future goals become important. Who says a one-night stand cannot turn into a long-lasting partnership? And who would propose marriage on the first date? Moreover, human relationships between individuals from different cultures have to cope with different conventions of what is proper. It helps us tremendously to use our experiences in our personal lives to influence our professional lives, and aid the process of international partnership.
