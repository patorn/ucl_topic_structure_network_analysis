Hundreds of people, meanwhile, flocked to the town to show their support for its residents.   Related: Islamville, South Carolina's all-Muslim town, faces Trump effect: 'We feel unsafe'    American Bikers United Against Jihad spent months calling for people to take part in the event, which organizers described as a \u201cride for national security\u201d and promised would see \u201chundreds\u201d of bikers riding past Islamberg, in upstate New York. But the five riders who showed up found themselves completely overshadowed when more than 400 people travelled to Islamberg \u2013 some driving for hours to get there \u2013 to take part in a \u201cpeace rally and community day\u201d. As the motorcyclists rode past the town, about three hours north-west of New York City, residents and supporters stood along the street. Some waved American flags, some called out \u201cWelcome!\u201d Others chanted: \u201cFreedom, justice, USA!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re riding against,\u201d said Islamberg mayor Rashid Clark. \u201cMy only concern is for our safety. It doesn\u2019t provoke me.\u201d After witnessing the ride-by, the supporters \u2013 who included people from Christian churches and other faiths \u2013 were welcomed into the town. Residents laid on food, music and speeches from community leaders. \u201cWe just decided, \u2018OK, if you want to ride by we\u2019re going to hold a peace rally,\u2019\u201d said Clark, 46. \u201cAnd that idea came from the fact that all these community members, all these people you see here, they also found [details of the rally] online and they called us, and said they wanted to come and support. This turnout is not our doing.\u201d The majority of Islamberg residents are African Americans. The town was established by The Muslims of America in 1984, and is home to around 25 families. The organization has established more than a dozen towns across the US, with Islamberg serving as its headquarters. A series of online conspiracy theories have given rise to the idea that Muslims of America towns are home to jihad training camps. The notion has been repeatedly debunked by law enforcement officials, but this has not deterred extremists. In April 2015, a man named Robert Doggart pleaded guilty to planning to attack Islamberg. He faces trial this summer. In November 2015, the FBI issued a warning to New York police after Jon Ritzheimer, a man later involved in the occupation of the Malheur wildlife refuge in Oregon, posted a video online saying he planned to drive to Islamberg and confront residents.  American Bikers United Against Jihad planned to set off for Islamberg at noon. Ram Lubranicki, the main organiser, described the ride as an \u201ceducational\u201d event designed to draw attention to \u201cjihad camps\u201d in the town.

Photograph: Adam Gabbatt for the Guardian    Lubranicki, from New Jersey, called for bikers to congregate in a parking lot in Deposit, around seven miles from Islamberg. At 11.45am, there were three bikers present. \u201cSo far it\u2019s a little disappointing,\u201d Lubranicki said. \u201cIf we had great weather we could easily have a few hundred bikers here.\u201d Lubranicki was upbeat. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a lot of excitement about this idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of developing a website.\u201d Lubranicki was not riding a motorcycle. He said he was conscious he would be required to talk to the press \u2013 there were two journalists present \u2013 and there would be a lot of organizing to do. Lubranicki had travelled from New Jersey in a champagne-colored Hyundai Sonata. As he waited for bikers to arrive, he draped a banner over the rear of the car. It bore the logo of the American Bikers United Against Jihad: a skull draped in the American flag with a sword alongside. Beneath the banner there was a bottle, functioning as a collections jar. It contained $23. A fourth motorcyclist \u2013 a man named Hal, who was wearing a skull cap and a black leather vest with a large Grateful Dead patch on the back \u2013 arrived at 11.55am. Another turned up at 12.05.  The riders delayed the start for an hour, in case any attendees were late arriving. None were.  The group drew out of the parking lot at 1pm, the five bikers following Lubranicki\u2019s Sonata. Three other cars were present, bringing the number of ride against jihad attendees to 12 people and one dog. State troopers were posted along the route to Islamberg, but the ride passed without event. The riders finished their tour at a parking lot beyond the town, before going their separate ways.  Back at Islamberg, hundreds were enjoying food prepared by the town\u2019s residents. A large tent had been erected: attendees chatted as they dined on chicken, pasta, potato salad and salad. Josie Hovis, 15, had heard about the peace rally through her church, Cooperstown First Presbyterian, and had travelled the two hours with her parents and brother. \u201cYou hear a lot of nasty information in the news, especially in this presidential campaign, and it makes you sad and depressed about the state of things in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut most of the time people don\u2019t really do anything about it. And this was an opportunity to really take action about the bigotry we see today.\u201d Dr Bilqees Abdullah, who declined to give her age but described herself as \u201cseasoned\u201d, has lived in Islamberg for around 30 years. She works in a local hospital as well as providing care for the elderly in the town. \u201cIt was very, very heartwarming,\u201d she said of the peace rally. \u201cTo see so many people come and join and actually say: \u2018This isn\u2019t right, this isn\u2019t fair, and we\u2019re not going for it,\u2019 it\u2019s wonderful. Very wonderful.\u201d",
