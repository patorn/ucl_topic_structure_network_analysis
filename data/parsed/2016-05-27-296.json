  "body": "Game of Thrones fans who enjoy the cutting jibes and razor-sharp wit of Tyrion Lannister will love our Family Guy parody featuring Stewie Griffin as the Peter Dinklage character. And if you are into Family Guy, you probably also appreciate The Simpsons. When Simpsons \u201cvoice\u201d, the actor Hank Azaria, was invited to give the graduation speech at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, he decided to use the voices of characters such as Chief Wiggum, Moe Szyslak and Comic Book Guy to give the students some advice. A laughing driver who dons a Star Wars Chewbacca mask and can\u2019t stop chuckling has taken the internet by storm. When James Corden invites Candace Payne to drive him to work and then loses his patience with her, Star Wars director J.J. Abrams is on hand to offer some notes on her performance.   Related: Viral video: Justin Timberlake, Eurovision and Demi Lovato    From Star Wars to Star Trek, and we have a new trailer for Star Trek Beyond, whose stars include Idris Elba, Chris Pine, Simon Pegg, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana. We\u2019ve also got a sneak peek at the new Beauty and the Beast movie and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney in a promo for X-Men: Apocalypse. Finally, Grant Thompson, the King of Random, explains what happens if you spray liquid nitrogen in your face (we wouldn\u2019t advise it!) and meet Lakomi \u2013 a wolf who lives in a sanctuary and who absolutely adores tummy tickles. Enjoy!
