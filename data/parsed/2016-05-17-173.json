  "body": "Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Verdejo is running through the team written on the paper in front of him, smoke rising slowly from the cigarette in his right hand, a Coke bottle on the table. Andr\u00e9s Palop in goal; a back four of Dani Alves, Federico Fazio, Martin C\u00e1ceres and Adriano; Ivan Rakitic, J\u00falio Baptista, Seydou Keita and Christian Poulsen in midfield; Lu\u00eds Fabiano and Carlos Bacca up front. All men he signed, for little over \u20ac25m (\u00a323.5m). All men he sold too, for around \u20ac170m. Then there\u2019s Sergio Ramos, Jes\u00fas Navas, Alberto Moreno, Luis Alberto and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes: players he didn\u2019t need to buy but did need to sell, youth products who raised almost \u20ac100m.   Related: Liverpool\u2019s Adam Lallana on J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Europa League glory    In his office is a photograph in which he stands alongside Diego Maradona with whom he became close even though he says he was pretty much the least important person at Sevilla in 1992, \u201cthe last monkey: a 23-year-old sub goalkeeper\u201d. These days he\u2019s pretty much the most important person at Sevilla. This morning he has mundane tasks to attend to \u2013 the logistics of players\u2019 luggage for Basel \u2013 but the man they call Monchi is the sporting director and the architect who transformed the club. When Monchi took over in 2000, Sevilla faced a financial crisis and had just been relegated. Sixteen years on, they play Liverpool in the Europa League final seeking their third title in a row, their fifth in a decade. Four days later they play Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final. Fourteen finals in 10 years while making the profit their model demands, selling players such as Baptista for a \u20ac24m profit or making \u20ac17.5m on Rakitic. Until Monchi arrived they had won four trophies ever, none in 52 years and success is what most satisfies: Monchi\u2019s personal perfect XI would include Fredi Kanout\u00e9, who made them no money but scored in five finals. \u201cNo one takes a \u2018what great economic results\u2019 banner to the stadium,\u201d he says. Of all his signings, Kanout\u00e9 would be \u201ctop three\u201d, Monchi says, alongside Fabiano and Alves, who arrived an unknown 19-year old for around \u20ac200,000, having been spotted on one of those first scouting missions, and left for \u20ac36m with five titles under his arm. Each time they have sold, they have kept winning; Alves won this competition in 2006 and 2007 before departing. After the 2014 final, Rakitic went to Barcelona; after 2015, Carlos Bacca left for Milan.     Dani Alves in Sevilla colours in February 2007. The defender, now with Barcelona, is among Monchi\u2019s many success stories in the transfer market. Photograph: Cristina Quicler/AFP/Getty Images    The inevitable question is: who goes after 2016? (K\u00e9vin Gameiro and Grzegorz Krychowiak are candidates). But also: who comes next? Monchi has replacements ready. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trauma any more,\u201d he admits. \u201c\u00c1lvaro Negredo leaves and you think it\u2019s the end of the world but along comes Bacca; then he goes and Gameiro proves himself.\u201d Up the lift where a musak version of Sevilla\u2019s anthem plays and along to his office, Monchi outlines the methodology. Outside, an agent is waiting; one of his players is renewing today. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to con this guy,\u201d he jokes. Inside, Monchi explains: \u201cSixteen people cover a series of leagues. For the first five months we watch a lot of football but with no particular aim: we\u2019re just accumulating data. Every month we produce an ideal XI for each league. Then in December we start watching players who appeared regularly in different contexts \u2013 home, away, international \u2013 to build the broadest possible profile.\u201d Monchi pulls out his phone and, carefully reducing the image so the names can\u2019t be seen, says: \u201cThat gives us this.\u201d A colour-coded spreadsheet shows players by position. Around 250 potential targets, in all positions. \u201cThe manager says: \u2018I want a left-back who averages 11km a game, runs 800m at full speed, uses both feet.\u2019 And from these, 10 will fit.\u201d Negotiations come next, where you have to know the market, have an alternative, and be realistic. \u201cThe guy selling a Seat Leon will claim it\u2019s a better model,\u201d Monchi says. \u201cKanout\u00e9 wasn\u2019t the first option; we were going after Fred, the Brazilian. We wanted [Kevin-Prince] Boateng before Keita. And if a player says: \u2018Chelsea want me,\u2019 I say: \u2018What are you talking to me for, then?\u2019 But if Swansea or Spurs want you, let\u2019s talk. I sell the city, the club: a serious club that pays as promised, which sounds trivial but isn\u2019t.\u201d There\u2019s no guarantee, of course. \u201cAfter a month [Yevhen] Konoplyanka wanted to throw himself off the balcony. I try to really know the player but there are always surprises. Grzegorz Krychowiak, aged 19. You think: \u2018What\u2019s a Pole going to be like here?\u2019 But it turns out he\u2019s the most sevillano bloke ever. Arouna Kon\u00e9 was our most expensive signing and scored two in 41; he goes to Levante, a \u2018weaker\u2019 team, and scores 17.\u201d     K\u00e9vin Gameiro, left, is presented by Monchi, right, and Sevilla\u2019s former president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda del Nido in 2013. This summer the forward could be the next big-money departure. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    Monchi is quick to share success and admit the role played by fortune: Rakitic\u2019s doubts were swept away on the first night of negotiations when he met his future wife. He talks about mistakes and takes responsibility for failure, calls his managers \u201cvictims\u201d of a model that typically sees double-digit ins and outs every summer, and recalls the ones that got away \u2013 including \u201cfalling in love\u201d with Luis Su\u00e1rez. He says it is harder than ever, competition stiffer than when he started. But he has been successful. It helps that he never switches off, grinning: \u201cI took my family to Sicily and it just happened that there was a game on.\u201d He has signed more than 200 players, but not one Briton. Are we really so bad? \u201cNo!\u201d Monchi laughs. \u201cYou have to persuade a player on many levels \u2013 football, life, finance. Competing with English clubs economically was always tough; now it\u2019s almost impossible, although we have bought from there. Iago Aspas and [Steven] N\u2019Zonzi, for example. It\u2019s a good market as English clubs buy a lot of players and only 11 can play; there\u2019s an excess you can look at. We can\u2019t sign Liverpool players: Sturridge, Firmino, Coutinho. But maybe if someone\u2019s not playing regularly somewhere there\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d   Related: Jerzy Dudek: \u2018Liverpool need new heroes \u2013 Europa League final can create them\u2019    A cash-rich import market, England is useful too. Gary Medel, Alberto Moreno, Navas, Reyes and Negredo went to the Premier League, their fees totalling more than \u00a365m. \u201cEngland\u2019s a good client,\u201d Monchi says. A stupid one, with more money than sense? Monchi says no, but there are differences he discovered when he set up in London for six months to analyse it better. \u201cThere are loads of off-field things in which they beat us easily,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd on the football side, I saw very good work being done. But there\u2019s a disconnect between that work and the advantage they glean from it. I know English clubs that are very professional, scouts everywhere, but the information they gather isn\u2019t always applied. Why? Because they have money. That enables them to take fewer risks: \u2018I\u2019m not going to discover Keita at Lens; let Sevilla do that and then buy Keita from Sevilla.\u2019\u201d And so Keita goes to Sevilla first, then moves on, which is good for everyone. But first: football. \u201cWinning has given us sporting glory and that has a knock-on effect economically,\u201d Monchi says. \u201cWe\u2019ve created an environment conducive to players succeeding and improving. I went down to the dressing room after the semi-final and Adil Rami, who\u2019s been at Lille, Valencia and Milan, hugged me and said: \u2018I don\u2019t know what it is about this club but I\u2019ve never played a final in my life before and in one year I\u2019m playing three.\u2019\u201d",
