  "body": "Friday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood Fresh from a double at the Brigadier Gerard meeting at Sandown last night, Ryan Moore is back on his hometown turf at Brighton this afternoon for four rides - three favourites and a joint-favourite. The way he is riding at the moment, a four-timer is a distinct possibility.   Related: Horse racing tips: Friday 27 May    Monk\u2019s Stand (2.20) should certainly take the opening novice stakes, while Goldenfield (3.50) and Loving Your Work (4.20) have obvious chances too which Moore is likely to maximise. Nag\u2019s Wag, though, could be the weak link in the second race, if Al Sailiyah (2.50) can back up her win at this track 11 days ago. That was the first time that Al Sailiyah had reproduced her all-weather form on turf, and while it was over an extended five furlongs rather than today\u2019s six, she stayed on well in the closing stages and could well find a little more improvement for the extra furlong. A 6lb rise from her last outing, which was her handicap debut, is not too taxing in any case. On a decent card at Haydock, Threat Assessed (5.10) could be the answer to a competitive one-mile handicap. Clive Cox\u2019s colt ran away with a Chepstow maiden last time out and an opening mark of 80 could prove to be lenient, not least given the stable\u2019s current form with eight winners from 27 runners over the last fortnight. Masterpaver (3.40) has a clear chance on the same card, while at Bath, Esteemable (3.00) is a fair price at around 100-30 for the fillies\u2019 handicap. Tipping competition, day five Our winners so far: Monday Final Venture 7-2 Outback Blue 14-1 The Tin Man 3-1 Tuesday Ickymasho 11-4 Benissimo 7-2 Swashbuckling 6-1 Wednesday Sir Note 3-1 Floresco 14-1 Magnus Maximus 11-2 Thursday Snap Shots 6-1 Time Test 3-1 Chevallier 12-1 And our leader is: 72luca +17.50 \u2026 who shored up his lead with Time Test. Other good scores in a low-scoring week: kmill68 +12.75, cornsay +8.75, jakesnake1 +7, dean055 +5, sandiuk +3, Luke Owen +3. For today\u2019s thrilling climax, we\u2019d like your tips, please, for these races: 5.10 Haydock, 7.40 Musselburgh, 8.00 Pontefract. This week\u2019s prize is a pair of tickets to Epsom\u2019s Duchess Stand for Derby day a week on Saturday, 4 June. You could be there for one of the most open Derbys in memory and perhaps a star will emerge before your very eyes! If you don\u2019t win, you can buy tickets here. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today but you will start on -12. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day (TODAY).
