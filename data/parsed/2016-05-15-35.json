  "body": "There is a moment early in Mike Tyson\u2019s autobiography, Undisputed Truth, when it becomes clear that the baddest man on the planet does not much care for fighting any more. That epiphany visits all boxers eventually. But for Tyson the moment arrives not at the strung-out denouement of his career, as he sags on his stool following defeat against the Irish journeyman Kevin McBride, but at its thrillingly turbulent epicentre. Seven months after Tyson knocked out Trevor Berbick in two rounds to become, aged 20, the youngest heavyweight world champion in history he faced a reunification bout against Tony Tucker. \u201cThis was going to be the biggest fight of my career, the fight to unify all three titles,\u201d he writes. \u201cI pulled [close friend] Steve Lott aside one day in the gym. \u2018I\u2019m going to retire,\u2019 I said.\u201d   Related: Tyson Fury\u2019s demons keep prodding him into the theatre of the absurd | Kevin Mitchell    It is a recurring theme, even after Tyson became undisputed champion. \u201cFrank Bruno should have kicked my ass,\u201d Tyson remembers. \u201cI just didn\u2019t care any more. I was tired of fighting. I wasn\u2019t in training. I was just sleeping with women.\u201d Before the myth of his invincibility was crumpled by Buster Douglas in Tokyo Tyson even had to be dragged on to the plane. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fight,\u201d he admits. \u201cAll I was interested in then was partying.\u201d It was only after his final contest against McBride, in 2005, that Tyson admitted that in effect he had lived a lie for 25 years. He had not enjoyed fighting since 1990. Increasingly \u2013 and sadly \u2013 it seems that Tyson and Britain\u2019s current WBA and WBO title holder, Tyson Fury, share more than a name and world championship belts. It is nearly seven months since Fury outpointed Wladimir Klitschko to become the lineal heavyweight champion. Yet just like Tyson before facing Tucker, he appears fickle and restless \u2013 only it is tumbling out in a much more public way. Recently Fury has talked of retiring \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be my last fight win, lose or draw. Shit or bust. I\u2019m so sick of it. I\u2019ve got no motivation to carry it on\u201d \u2013 or moving to America. He has revelled in his baroque rolls of fat two months before his rematch with Klitschko. And last Friday he returned to the pulpit, attacking what he suggested was a godless society ravaged by paedophiles, bisexuals, transexuals and a lack of morals. This time, though, the rant had a further worrying element: paranoia. It is not uncommon for fighters to believe that someone is out to screw them after they win a world title. Usually their fire is concentrated on promoters or the size of their purses. Fury, though, is garbling on about Zionist conspiracies. Some believe Fury is merely toying with the media. To them his recent behaviour is just more pantomime shock-jockery guaranteed to put the Fairtrade pants of any liberal in a twist. But, to these eyes, like Tyson before him, it looks more as if he is grasping for a way out. For, as Tyson discovered, becoming world champion is no cure-all for long-standing problems outside the ring. \u201cI was always mad at the world,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI always felt empty. Being champ of the world just accelerated and intensified those feelings \u2013 I didn\u2019t care what anybody thought about me.\u201d Arguably some of the most notorious moments in Tyson\u2019s late career, including biting Evander Holyfield\u2019s ear and Lennox Lewis\u2019s leg and attempting to break Frans Botha\u2019s arm, were not just about trying to maintain his reputation as his powers waned but also about trying to self\u2011destruct his way out of the sport. His autobiography is crass and self\u2011pitying yet always compelling; the only thing he appears to hate more than the business of boxing is himself. Only towards the end is there some uneasy semblance of peace. Fury is not straightforward, either. His supporters offer a continual reminder that, despite a tough upbringing, his only problem with the law has been a solitary parking ticket. His promoter, Mick Hennessy, calls him \u201cgenuine and honest\u201d and speaks warmly of his charity work. Fury, he insists, should be judged by his actions, not his oratory. Incidentally, I remember speaking to Fury in 2012 after he had posted on Twitter: \u201cdont like gays shoul all b shot dead.\u201d After claiming that his friends had posted it Fury appeared to make a sincere apology. \u201cIt\u2019s the 21st century so who cares who is gay and who ain\u2019t?\u201d he insisted. \u201cPeople who know me will tell you I\u2019ve had many a good night out with a few gay people I know. Whatever they are it\u2019s none of my business and it\u2019s got nothing to do with boxing.\u201d Fury also wished the Puerto Rican boxer Orlando Cruz, who had recently came out as gay, well and told me: \u201cGive him my number and we\u2019ll go for a beer.\u201d At that point it was easier to believe that Fury might be wild and unpredictable but his head and heart were fundamentally in the right place. He said something else, too. \u201cRight now it seems to be there\u2019s a story about me every day but I want to make headlines for the right reasons.\u201d Despite reaching the peak of his profession that wish appears more elusive than ever.",
