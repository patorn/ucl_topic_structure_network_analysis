The November elections appear to have catalyzed a craze for what one might term the \u201cpolitobituary\u201d \u2013 obituaries that include political messages, or posthumous endorsements for a particular presidential candidate. Take Jeffrey Cohen, a celebrated Pittsburgh chiropractor, whose obituary pleaded: \u201cIn lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Donald Trump.\u201d. Sadly, six days after he died, his wife, Carol Chisholm Cohen, followed. Her obituary thanked \u201ceveryone who pledged to honor Jeffrey\u2019s request not to vote for Donald Trump. And to Jeffrey\u2019s detractors / Trump supporters \u2013 beware, [Carol] will likely haunt you until the election.\u201d  Dr Joshua Cohen, one of the couple\u2019s four sons, told me his parents hadn\u2019t specifically requested a \u201cdon\u2019t vote Trump\u201d line in their obituaries but had frequently made their dismay at Trump clear in their lifetimes. \u201cThey carried very strong opinions \u2026 [my] brothers and I wanted to give them a fitting send off.\u201d    According to this obituary, instead of choosing between Trump or Clinton, this lady went with another choice. pic.twitter.com/Gmd86RmvIM\u2014 R.L. Bynum (@RL_Bynum) May 17, 2016    Some people haven\u2019t trusted that their children will broadcast their political persuasions in quite the manner they\u2019d like and made their dying wishes very explicit. The obituary of 86-year-old grandmother \u201cRuth\u201d reads: \u201cAs stipulated in her will, Ruth wanted to make sure her obituary included this final line: \u2018If you vote for Donald Trump, you seriously must be a fucking dumb ass.\u2019\u201d Rather than backing a candidate there are some who prefer to use their obituary to effectively spoil their ballot. Mary Anne Noland\u2019s obituary states: \u201cFaced with the prospect of voting either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, Mary Anne Noland of Richmond chose, instead, to pass into the eternal love of God on Sunday.\u201d  Now all this is amusing in a very-sorry-for-your-loss sort of way but of little relevance to the November result, right? Dead people can\u2019t swing an election \u2026 can they? Well, where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way. The free media a viral obituary drums up is equivalent to a fortune in advertising spend. Dr Cohen says he hopes the press attention his parents\u2019 obituaries received does have an influence on how people vote. \u201cEvery little bit counts.\u201d Every little bit does count. Aside from the few \u2018politobituaries\u2019 that have gone viral, there are many many more. I looked up US obituaries from the last year, and tallied up \u201cpersuasive mentions\u201d of various candidates to find out what the posthumous polls can tell us about the election. These either state strong regret for not sticking around long enough to vote for Trump/Clinton/Sanders or implore mourners to vote for/against one of the three \u201cin lieu of flowers\u201d. The first thing to note is that Clinton seems to have stirred the dead more than Trump or Sanders. Clinton has inspired 40 obituary mentions; 21 more than Trump who had 19; 33 more than Sanders who only had six.  Before the Clinton crowd feels too smug, it should be noted that not all obituary publicity is good publicity. Clinton inspired far more more negative feeling than anyone else. Twenty-eight obituaries exhorted people not to vote for her. Only one person didn\u2019t \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d from beyond the grave, and seven obituaries asked people not to vote for Trump. Let\u2019s look at how the \u201cyes\u201d ballots were cast. Twelve obituaries asked people to vote for Clinton; 11 obituaries asked people to vote Trump; five people rooted for Sanders. Clinton may pip Trump in the \u201cvote for Her\u201d obituaries but it doesn\u2019t quite balance out all the negative campaigning. So what\u2019s the net-net with all this? Well I\u2019m afraid that once you\u2019ve crunched all the numbers it seems that Trump is the clear winner in the posthumous polls. Which really goes to prove what has been clear all along: Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters are literally brain dead.",
