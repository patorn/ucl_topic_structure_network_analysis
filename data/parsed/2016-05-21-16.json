  "body": "The official campaign to leave the EU fronted by Michael Gove has been accused of \u201cstoking the fires of prejudice\u201d after it claimed that continued membership would put Britons in danger as a result of a high level of criminality among Turkish citizens. In a potentially incendiary intervention \u2013 on the eve of an England v Turkey football match in Manchester \u2013 coordinated statements from a government minister and Vote Leave not only claimed that Turkey was about to join the EU, but that its citizens posed a threat to national security, as well as to public services.   Related: \u2018Why are they making us out to be such a threat?\u2019: Turks react to Vote Leave    An analysis by the Brexit campaign group cited higher levels of criminality and gun ownership in Turkey as evidence for their position, which was supported by a statement from Penny Mordaunt, a defence minister who backs Brexit. Vote Leave said: \u201cSince the birthrate in Turkey is so high, we can expect to see an additional million people added to the UK population from Turkey alone within eight years. \u201cThis will not only increase the strain on Britain\u2019s public services, but it will also create a number of threats to UK security. Crime is far higher in Turkey than the UK. Gun ownership is also more widespread. Because of the EU\u2019s free movement laws, the government will not be able to exclude Turkish criminals from entering the UK.\u201d     The controversial Vote Leave campaign poster. Photograph: Vote Leave    Despite Downing Street\u2019s insistence that Turkey\u2019s accession to the EU was not imminent, Mordaunt said in her statement that a vote to remain in the EU on 23 June was a vote in favour of Turks moving \u201chere freely when they join the EU soon\u201d. A Vote Leave poster will be launched on Monday depicting an EU passport as an open door, with footprints leading through it. It will claim: \u201cTurkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Vote Leave, take back control.\u201d These developments prompted criticism from a series of high-profile figures, including Trevor Phillips, a former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who claimed it was a desperate ploy. The Observer/Opinium\u2019s latest on-line poll suggests 44% of UK adults will vote to remain in the EU, while 40% will vote to leave and 14% are undecided.     Trevor Phillips condemned the Vote Leave poster as a \u2018desperate move\u2019. Photograph: David Hartley/Rex/Shutterstock    Phillips said that, while the issue of immigration should be debated, the \u201clatest assault from the Leave campaign seems to me to plumb the deepest depths\u201d. He said: \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any doubt that what they are appealing to here is straightforward prejudice. I can\u2019t imagine what the sizeable, law-abiding, industrious Turkish community in the UK must feel when they hear this. \u201cThis appears to be a straightforward admission that the Leave campaign has lost on every rational argument and now it is simply trying to stoke the fires of prejudice.\u201d Europe minister David Lidington said it was \u201ccomplete fantasy\u201d to suggest that Turkey or Albania would become members of the European Union within five years. \u201cIt is ridiculous,\u201d he said. The shadow justice secretary, Lord Falconer, said he was concerned by Vote Leave\u2019s indifference to the damage to community relations caused by its claims. \u201cIt is dangerous and inflames racism to imply many of the Turks who are coming may be criminals with guns,\u201d Falconer said. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned about the way the Brexiters appear utterly indifferent to the long-term damage they are doing. \u201cArgue their case by all means, but don\u2019t descend into the gutter and poison good community relationships. Gove is showing no integrity whatsoever in what he says in the referendum debate.\u201d Vote Leave countered that the home secretary, Theresa May, had herself raised concerns about Turkish organised crime in April. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, will throw City Hall behind the Remain campaign on Monday, with a major social media drive, a series of set-piece speeches and newspaper advertising. From Sunday, the European Union flag will also be flown outside the mayor\u2019s headquarters to symbolise its new position on the referendum. On Friday, Gove, who is justice secretary, argued that Turkey and four other countries could join the EU as soon as 2020 and lead to 5.2 million extra people moving to the UK, a population the size of Scotland or four cities the size of Birmingham, putting intolerable pressure on the NHS. In Vote Leave\u2019s latest analysis it warns that Turkey will join the EU \u201cin the next few years\u201d and that its population is set to hit 82 million by 2020, many of whom will seek to come to Britain. It is claimed that, as well as threatening the UK\u2019s security, the growing Turkish population in the UK will cost NHS maternity services an extra \u00a3400m within 10 years of the country joining the EU. Mordaunt said: \u201cWe are currently sending over \u00a31bn to Turkey to help it to join the EU. We must recognise the huge strain this will place on our NHS as more people come here, without giving it any chance of planning for such increased demand. Expansion is at the EU\u2019s core. We have to be honest about the cost of EU membership for our public services today and in the future: and particularly what this will mean for the NHS unless we take back control and Vote Leave on 23 June.\u201d Professor Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, condemned Vote Leave\u2019s claims about the future of the NHS. \u201cIt is unacceptable for Leave campaigners to keep dragging the NHS through the mud,\u201d he said.",
