  "body": "1. Turnbull calls out Shorten for claiming credit for government policies Malcolm Turnbull called Shorten out early for taking credit for the government\u2019s good works (or following the opposition\u2019s lead, depending on which side you believe). In response to the first question about businesses moving offshore, Shorten asked: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Labor\u2019s efforts, would we be talking about building submarines in South Australia today?\u201d In response to the second, on multinational tax avoidance, Shorten said \u201cwe have championed making multinationals pay their fair share, and we\u2019ve had some success in convincing the government\u201d to pursue it. Turnbull shot back: \u201cBill is taking credit for many of the things the government has done\u201d. He said Labor hadn\u2019t commissioned any ships to be built in Australia\u2019s shipyards, in comparison to 54 by the current government.

Shorten\u2019s bank bashing goes down a treat Shorten enjoyed a good bout of bank bashing - calling for a royal commission due to scandals such as CommInsure failing to pay out on insurance contracts, and attacking them for ATM withdrawal fees and not bringing credit card interest rates down. Turnbull asked why Shorten had written elsewhere that he wanted to \u201cput banks in the dock\u201d, pointing out \u201cthat\u2019s where a person accused of a crime stands\u201d. \u201cHere you\u2019ve got Bill, who wants to be prime minister, and he wants to line them up as if they\u2019re all criminals.\u201d A brief clap from someone on the floor drew a smile from Shorten, who seemed confident that no Aussie voters would sympathise with the bankers. Evidently \u201cthere\u2019s some sentiment the banks aren\u2019t all sweet and clean\u201d, Speers summarised. Turnbull said he\u2019d given banks \u201ca bit of a lecture on the important cultural changes\u201d they needed to make at a Westpac birthday do. Shorten\u2019s reply was withering: \u201cI\u2019m sure they just went home and changed their practices after a lecture from you ... How many scandals will it take before a Liberal government says [banks] need more than a telling off?\u201d 3. The leaders clash on housing affordability Turnbull attacked Labor\u2019s plans to eliminate negative gearing (on all assets but new properties) and increasing capital gains tax by 50%. He said the policies would increase rents and cited a real estate industry campaign against Labor\u2019s policies and \u201cAussie John\u201d Symonds for the claim. He had all the facts and figures to hand too \u2013 things such as there being 69,000 families who rent within half an hour\u2019s drive of the Windsor RSL. Shorten dismissed the real estate agents\u2019 campaign as a scare campaign, and said it was no surprise they backed the Coalition because \u201ctheir business model relies on a taxpayer subsidy\u201d. \u201cWhy should first home buyers compete on an unlevel playing field against investors with 10 or more properties?\u201d Turnbull rattled off another statistic: there are 48,000 taxpayers within half an hour\u2019s drive using negative gearing, and 30,000 of those earned less than $80,000. \u201cBill\u2019s proposition this is all about millionaires is dead wrong.\u201d Shorten ridiculed the idea negative gearing is a \u2018robin hood\u2019 measure that helps the less well advantaged. \u201cPlease \u2013 a crocodile wouldn\u2019t swallow that.\u201d Shorten said there were 60,000 Australians who claimed to have no taxable income after negative gearing. He questioned what bank would lend to people with no income and concluded \u201cit\u2019s a nonsense\u201d.   Related: Voters grill Turnbull and Shorten at people's forum \u2013 as it happened    4. Host David Speers drags Turnbull through shopping list of potential privatisations  Michael, an electrical trades worker, asked about privatisation.  Shorten mixed his metaphors by saying the pendulum (or was it the tide?) had swung too far on privatisation and championed public ownership to maintain quality of services. He gave the example of privatisation of Medibank, the health insurance company, which he said had caused the benefits payable to policy-holders to shrink.  Host David Speers then dragged Turnbull through a shopping list of government-owned businesses that might be privatised.  Turnbull chuckled at the idea Australia Post might be privatised. \u201cHave you looked at the accounts?\u201d, he asked, before ruling it out. The \u201ccore assets\u201d of Australian Submarine Corporation would remain under government ownership too, he said.  Finally it was Shorten who found something that might be privatised \u2013 Australian Hearing Services. Turnbull said he did not want to get caught in an \u201cideological battle\u201d about whether public or private ownership was better, only getting the best service for people with hearing disabilities. (And implied \u2013 that might be a private provider). 5. Concluding statements: it\u2019s the economy, stupid, but Shorten squeezes in a mention of climate change In his concluding statement, Turnbull focused on the need to live within our means, pivoting off the final question of the night about returning to surplus. \u201cWe\u2019re determined to provide the leadership and the discipline the Liberal and National Coalition has always done \u2013 we paid off Paul Keating\u2019s debt when John Howard came into government, and left cash in the bank, a lot of it [in 2007].\u201d He warned about the \u201csame old Labor \u2013 spend and tax, deficit and a mountain of debt, we\u2019ve got to bring that to an end\u201d. Shorten focused on Labor\u2019s \u201cpositive plans for the future\u201d \u2013 on jobs, health and education. He criticised trickle down economics and painted an alternative vision of equal opportunity and a fair go all round. He mentioned climate change \u2013 just the second mention for the night (the first was in his opening) \u2013 and said it was a threat to household cost of living that could be combatted with more renewable energy.",
