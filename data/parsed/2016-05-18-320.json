Most of the team and manager arrived at dawn in the Thai capital and are due to brave the tropical heat for an open-top bus ride through the centre on Thursday. They are also expected to visit the royal palace. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, a Thai duty-free magnate and the club\u2019s billionaire owner, arranged their trip. When Leicester City team members visited Thailand a year ago, three players \u2013 including the son of then manager Nigel Pearson \u2013 were filmed making racist comments in a sex tape and were later fired.

Known locally as the Siamese Foxes, the team\u2019s following has grown among Thailand\u2019s active football community. This time, the club has a strict schedule. Manager Claudio Ranieri, captain Wes Morgan and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel were spotted at the airport, where hordes of local media and fans waited for their arrival. But strikers Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez and midfielders Danny Drinkwater and N\u2019Golo Kante were not seen. Vardy was also caught up in controversy last summer, filmed on CCTV abusing a fellow gambler in a casino and calling him \u201cJap\u201d on three occasions. The England player was fined and ordered by his club to undergo a course in diversity awareness. It is not clear if the players will take a break at one of Thailand\u2019s renowned resorts after the two-day visit in Bangkok.

Staff and supporters are regularly treated to free beers and fresh prawns as they watch games on a big screen. The club\u2019s owner has also flown Buddhist monks to England to bless the stadium and the players. A portrait of the Thai King Bhumibol, the world\u2019s longest serving monarch, was raised after the Foxes were presented with the cup. Leicester City will play in the in the Champions League next season against the top clubs in Europe. They finished 10 points above Arsenal despite having 5000/1 odds against them at the start of this season. The players had held a victory parade in the Midlands city of Leicester on Monday.           \u2018It\u2019s unbelievable\u2019: Leicester City victory parade met by thousands \u2013 video",
