  "body": "Indefinite detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru is psychological torture, World Vision Australia\u2019s chief executive, Tim Costello, has said. Speaking on Sky on Sunday, Costello said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the psychological torture of not being able to actually resettle, and you can\u2019t go back home, is torture.\u201d Costello said the case of a Somalian woman who set herself on fire on Nauru showed how desperate the federal government\u2019s refugee policy was making people.   Related: Family of refugee who died after self-immolating on Nauru say \u2018hope is dead\u2019    The act of self-immolation by 21-year-old Hadon came just weeks after a 23-year-old Iranian man, Omid, died after setting himself alight in protest on Nauru. Costello said 98% of women in Somalia suffered genital mutilation.  \u201cSomalia is a terrifying place \u2013 you would flee that, I would flee that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thought of that young woman, of desperation, [of] indefinite stay on Nauru, [she] can\u2019t go back to Somalia, set herself on fire \u2013 that\u2019s the sort of psychological torture I think is going on.\u201d Responding to the comments, Bill Shorten said: \u201cIn terms of what Tim Costello is talking about in the cost and the pain and the suffering of indefinite detention, I think he has a point. \u201cAs prime minister, I would prioritise regional resettlement. The answer to defeating the people smugglers cannot be indefinite detention. That is what the government is pushing.  \u201cThe truth of the matter, this government has let delays blow out. They have not been transparent in terms of the treatment of people in our care. I sympathise with what Tim Costello is saying. \u201cThe best answer is to defeat the people smugglers and make sure that the people in our care, directly or indirectly, get proper resettlement.\u201d Shorten reiterated Labor\u2019s commitment to prevent drowning at sea, including by use of controversial boat towbacks, which he has been at pains to stress after the government spent two weeks on the campaign trail suggesting Labor\u2019s policies would lead to more boats of asylum seekers coming to Australia. At a doorstop in Sydney on Sunday, Malcolm Turnbull said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t accept what Tim Costello says there. \u201cIt is absolutely critical that we maintain a secure border protection policy and that is why it is absolutely critical that people who seek to come to Australia through the services of people smugglers are not able to settle in Australia.\u201d The UN has ruled that Australia\u2019s indefinite detention of refugees on secret security grounds is arbitrary and illegal. The government should offer compensation to those it incarcerated without charge for up to six years, the UN\u2019s human rights committee has said.   Related: Dutton's refugee remarks face uncertain reception in multicultural marginals    On Saturday Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, announced if elected Labor would reverse a $224m cut to foreign aid in the 2016 budget. The $224m cut was part of a $11.3bn reduction over five years by the Coalition government compared with levels Labor projected in May 2013. She also promised to provide $450m over three years to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, placing Australia in the top-five global contributors. The torture comments come after immigration minister, Peter Dutton, made inflammatory remarks on Tuesday that many refugees were not numerate or literate and would take Australian jobs. On Wednesday Turnbull backed Dutton, calling him an \u201coutstanding immigration minister\u201d. Turnbull repeated Dutton\u2019s observation \u201cmany [refugees], large percentages of them, have no English skills at all ... [many] are illiterate in their own language\u201d. He added: \u201cMany haven\u2019t completed high school. That is no fault of theirs.\u201d Asked about Dutton\u2019s statement refugees took Australian jobs, Turnbull said: \u201cEverybody that comes to Australia we want to be able to seek employment. We want to be sure that they have got the skills to do so. \u201cWe want them to become part of our workforce.\u201d",
