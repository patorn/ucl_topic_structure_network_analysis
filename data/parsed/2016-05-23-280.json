After 8pm, if you\u2019re not on the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s books, tough: you\u2019ll get who you\u2019re given come 2 July. The latest polls suggest that could conceivably be a change of government, with Labor maintaining a 51-49 two-party-preferred lead and Bill Shorten continuing to gain in popularity and close the gap on Malcolm Turnbull.

Both of these assets are in the bellweather seat Eden Monaro, currently held by Liberal Peter Hendy on a margin of 2.9%. Meanwhile, Shorten appeared with Mark McGowan, WA Labor opposition leader, to announce $1bn towards the Perth Metronet. It would be funded by cuts to the federal commitment to Perth Freightlink \u2013 which, Shorten said, was a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. You were in the room, Sussan The Liberals are split over a couple of Labor policies: first, a crackdown on \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d by MPs who rent or own properties in Canberra, and also last week\u2019s Medicare rebate freeze announcement. Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Labor would ensure MPs claiming travel allowances and pursuing deductions were in line with community standards, and urged the Coalition to do the same. Specifically, he called for the tax ruling allowing politicians who rent properties in Canberra to claim deductions for a second residence to be brought under greater scrutiny. The treasurer said he would take a look at what Bowen was proposing, but Turnbull called Labor\u2019s commitment \u2013 which came after criticism of the practices in the media over the weekend \u2013 an \u201covernight backflip\u201d, alluding to various Opposition frontbenchers\u2019 calls for politicians to stay out of the system for parliamentary entitlements. This comes after Sussan Ley, the health minister, told Fran Kelly that she was in favour of lifting the Medicare rebate freeze, as Labor has vowed to do \u2013 but finance and treasury won\u2019t let her. Morrison said the freeze was a \u201cgovernment decision\u201d, and that Ley was \u201cobviously a part of\u201d the government. Remember, Sussan? Straight out of the mouth of Ray Shock jock Ray Hadley roasted the treasurer over a controversial point of the 2016 budget that means people will not get tax concessions on superannuation they voluntarily contribute above a lifetime cap of $500,000. Hadley said the government persisted with the cap at its \u201cown peril\u201d: \u201cunless you do something between now and 2 July ... this could be the rock on which you perish\u201d. Morrison defended the cap, saying that it applied to only a very small number of people, and that it was in the interests of younger Australians saving for their futures. Hadley retorted that this wouldn\u2019t be the policy with which to win over younger voters, who would \u201cgo Labor party or Greens\u201d. That is, if they vote at all.    18 to 24 years old?

Damning and shocking statistic imo.\u2014 Osman Faruqi (@oz_f) May 23, 2016      The comparable statistic for the rest of the Australian population is 6% btw. 6% vs 32%. What a joke.\u2014 Osman Faruqi (@oz_f) May 23, 2016    Voting is compulsory, but one quarter of Australians aged 18 to 24 are not enrolled, says the Australian Electoral Commission \u2013 a number that, if mobilised, could have real impact. Analysis by the not-for-profit organisation Y Vote found that the total number of wasted votes of electors or would-be electors aged 18 to 24 outnumbered the winning margin, by several multiples, in the 10 tightest contests.

Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has apologised to people convicted under historical laws criminalising gay sex. Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP    Victoria will on Tuesday become the first government in the world to formally apologise to people convicted under historical laws against homosexual sex. Before homosexuality was decriminalised in 1981, men could be sentenced for up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for having consensual sex with other men. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is now to apologise to those affected as part of legal reforms introduced in September to help those affected by the old laws to expunge their criminal convictions.

Exclusive: Pentagon source goes on record against whistleblower program    Long before Edward Snowden went public, John Crane was a top Pentagon official fighting to protect NSA whistleblowers. Instead their lives were ruined \u2013 and so was his. In the wake of Crane\u2019s startling account of how the system became a \u201ctrap\u201d for those seeking to expose wrongdoing, Snowden has called for a complete overhaul of US whistleblower protections.
