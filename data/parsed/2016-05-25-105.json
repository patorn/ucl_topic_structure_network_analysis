  "body": "Massaat, the runner-up to Galileo Gold in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in April, is \u201c99%\u201d certain to line up for the Derby at Epsom on Saturday week rather than the French equivalent the following day, Owen Burrows, the colt\u2019s trainer, said on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s got solid Group One form and some people say that the Guineas is the best trial for the Derby,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cHopefully, they\u2019re right.\u201d Massaat is the only horse entered in the Derby to have made his last two starts at Group One level, finishing second both times. He was one-and-a-half lengths behind Galileo Gold at Newmarket, and three-and-a-quarter behind Air Force Blue, last season\u2019s champion juvenile colt, in the Dewhurst Stakes at the same track in October.   Related: Frankie Dettori triumphs on Galileo Gold in Newmarket\u2019s 2,000 Guineas    He remains a 16-1 outsider for the Derby, however, not least because his pedigree raises questions about his stamina for the 12-furlong trip. \u201cEverybody can see his page,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cHe\u2019s out of an Acclamation mare and she was pretty quick herself, and he\u2019s a first foal, but if you looked at him as an individual and looked at his races without looking at his pedigree, you\u2019d certainly say that he\u2019d get further. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s still just slightly under consideration, as there\u2019s the French Derby the following day over the slightly shorter trip, but it\u2019s more than likely that it will be Epsom. \u201cIt\u2019s an open year, there\u2019s going to be a lot of runners and everybody\u2019s got the same opinion, that there isn\u2019t a standout odds-on shot. \u201cEverybody\u2019s thinking \u2018we have a chance\u2019, and we\u2019re the same. If there\u2019s plenty of runners, he\u2019s got one-mile Group One speed to hopefully get himself into a nice position, and then we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d If Massaat does go to post at Epsom, he is likely to be the only runner from the 2,000 Guineas to compete in both Classics. Galileo Gold was ruled out of the Derby after a genetics test carried out in Ireland suggested that there was \u201cless than a one per cent chance\u201d that 12 furlongs would be his optimum distance, but Burrows did not feel any need to assess Massaat\u2019s ideal trip the same way. \u201cHe\u2019s always shown us a nice bit at home from early last year when we first started working him on the grass,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cLooking at his races, even in the Guineas the winner just kicked and put a couple of lengths between them, but he didn\u2019t stop and if anything he was slightly gaining at the line. \u201cThat gives us the hope that he will get a bit further. I\u2019m pretty certain that he\u2019d get 10 furlongs, and we\u2019ll just have to see if he gets the mile and a half. It\u2019s one of those that you won\u2019t know until you try.\u201d Burrows is in his first season with a licence after taking over at Kingwood House Stables in Lambourn from Barry Hills, who saddled four runners-up in the Derby during a long and distinguished career but never the winner. \u201cMr Hills said to me after the Guineas that there\u2019s plenty of good mile-and-a-quarter horses that have won Derbys,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cHe was my 10th runner when he was second in the Guineas, and I think I\u2019ve had 19 now. There will be a few next week before the Derby, but he\u2019ll be in the mid-20s at most. To be competing in races like the Guineas and Derby after so few runners is something you can\u2019t dream of being involved with so soon.\u201d",
