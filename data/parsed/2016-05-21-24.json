Trudeau, impatient to get a vote started (on assisted death legislation), strode over to a scrum of stalling politicians, pulling chief opposition whip Gordon Brown towards his chair, allegedly shouting at others: \u201cGet the fuck out of the way\u201d, and sharply elbowed New Democratic party MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the chest. Brosseau was clearly shocked by the incident and left before the vote, with Trudeau later apologising for \u201cimpacting\u201d her. \u201cImpacting\u201d is one way of putting it, though it\u2019s clear from the footage that what happened to Brosseau was unintentional. So this wasn\u2019t about women politicians being molested or made to feel unsafe (a contention farcically milked by Trudeau\u2019s opponents in the aftermath). Trudeau didn\u2019t realise who was behind him or even that he was elbowing anyone.           Canadian PM Justin Trudeau apologises after physical altercation in parliament    However, how about what was intended? Why was Trudeau, a\u00a044-year-old politician, having a foul-mouthed tantrum over a (reportedly brief) delay to the start of a Commons vote? What made him think that he was free to manhandle Brown, or, indeed, anyone else? Crucially, has Canada\u2019s Sun King revealed a little too\u00a0much? This isn\u2019t an exclusively Canadian issue \u2013 not after the almost-blanket western dribbling over Trudeau, son of former PM, Pierre, and \u201chip\u201d beacon of genial liberalism, hailed as a happy contrast to the repressive, divisive, socially stiff previous Conservative leader Stephen Harper. However, even before The Elbow Cometh, the honeymoon was over. The cult of Trudeau was becoming too dominant; there were too many cutesy photo-ops, too much style over substance, and not enough hard government graft, his oft-cited likability starting to grate. So far, so normal for a new leader \u2013 the celestial glow and heavenly choir were always going to depart at some point. Still, there\u2019s no discounting the shock of seeing someone of Trudeau\u2019s rank manhandling others to make them do his bidding faster. It is usually assumed that people behave even worse in private than they do in public. I\u2019m not implying that Trudeau is battering politicians or anybody else behind closed doors. That would be ludicrous. However, his behaviour still speaks volumes: it was a display of impatience, immaturity (as long charged by his political enemies) and an overinflated sense of\u00a0entitlement.   Related: Elbowgate: is it the end of the Justin Trudeau honeymoon? | Stephen Maher    The last shouldn\u2019t be a surprise \u2013 it would be more surprising if Trudeau did not have a sense of entitlement. Take away the liberal giftwrap, and he\u2019s the son of a former leader, the product of a political dynasty as much as George W Bush. This isn\u2019t news. Nobody minded. I\u2019m sure many liked the nostalgic sprinkle of stardust (Pierre! Margaret!) that Justin Trudeau brought to the table. However, entitlement is a different matter: no one votes for that. And no one votes for out-of-control petulance. Which is why whom Trudeau \u201cimpacted\u201d is a side issue. I\u2019m not diminishing what happened to Brosseau. Men are always going on about how a kick to the crotch hurts: believe me, a sharp jab to the breasts isn\u2019t an umbrella-strewn cocktail. However, that was an accident. It was what Trudeau intended to do that mattered. This wasn\u2019t a leader asserting his authority \u2013 this was a little emperor stamping his foot because things weren\u2019t going his way fast enough. This was: \u201cDo as I say, I\u2019m very important, and always have been.\u201d The kind of behaviour that has spoiled rich kid written all over it. Will Trudeau\u2019s term be overshadowed by this? Let\u2019s hope not \u2013 and it\u2019s unlikely to be. It\u2019s early days, and Trudeau has plenty of time to make up for his mistake. However, mistake it was, and an illuminating one. Uh-oh \u2013 nuclear Kim is trying to quit     \u2018Supreme gasper\u2019: Kim Jong-Un indulges his former habit at a hospital in Pyongyang. Photograph: KNS/AFP    In the week of the introduction of standardised cigarette packets, it\u2019s also been announced that Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un has quit the fags in support of North Korea\u2019s anti-smoking policies. This is devastating news for those of us who, the odd bit of despotism aside, were fans of the Supreme Gasper\u2019s defiant smoking style. Not for Kim, the westerner\u2019s shame-faced query about whether it was OK to smoke on your garden decking, or self-conscious \u201csmirting\u201d on pavements outside restaurants. Kim would puff anywhere \u2013 in a famous incident in 2013 he even had a cigarette going when he was testing out some new exercise machines. However, alarm bells are ringing shrilly across the globe at the news that Kim has given up. As anyone who\u2019s given up smoking will know, tempers can fray during the process. A\u00a0happily smoking supreme leader was nerve-racking. Now that Kim has jacked in the snouts, let\u2019s hope North Korea has a large supply of Nicorette patches, and that no one leaves him alone near any super-special flashing red buttons. Every little black cab helps     \u2018Ferried around\u2019: Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins. Photograph: Tesco Bank/PA    Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins is reported to have spent more than \u00a318,000 on London cabs over eight months, despite the company\u2019s new cost-cutting measures. For that money, you\u2019d like to imagine that Higgins didn\u2019t even walk to the bathroom by himself, that he was driven right up to the urinal. However, Higgins seemed to have had a smashing time, being ferried around the capital \u2013 museums, opera houses, restaurants in Belgravia. Just the average London tourist itinerary then, if the tourist earned millions a year. I\u2019m sniping, but a little bit of me understands. Like Higgins, I grew up in that terrible dark savage place known as Not London, and I know how easy it is for people like us to become intoxicated by the allure of London black cabs. Years ago, during a very busy work period, I had to get black cabs all the time. It was horrifically expensive and I\u00a0barely claimed any of the cash back owing to my patented filing system of stuffing receipts in an open handbag, but still I loved it. All that self-important frenzied hailing made me feel like a proper \u201cmedia person\u201d for the first time. Much as I like minicabs, it\u2019s just not the same. Sure, other cities have black cabs too, but there\u2019s something about London ones, where the glamour sucks you in, changes a person. So yes, that\u2019s a big cab bill by anybody\u2019s standards, but I\u00a0can\u2019t help but sympathise. I have an image of Higgins sat on the back seat, thinking, \u201cOoh, this is the life, I finally feel as though I\u2019m the boss of Tesco Bank.\u201d",
