  "body": "The Department for Education has said it is going ahead with Tuesday\u2019s test of grammar and spelling for primary school pupils, despite the publication of the answers on the internet a day early. The decision followed a night of uncertainty after the Guardian reported that the paper had been mistakenly published online before it was due to be given to hundreds of thousands of primary school children across England.   Related: Five reasons parents are boycotting primary schools over Sats    The schools minister, Nick Gibb, will make a statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday morning after the Speaker granted Labour\u2019s call to discuss the mishap. A DfE spokesperson said the key stage 2 test of spelling, punctuation and grammar (Spag), which is compulsory for pupils in the final year of state primary school in England, would take place as planned but said its investigation would continue. The test results could be annulled if the DfE inquiry reveals the answers had been widely circulated.  The mishap \u2013 revealed by a whistleblower to the Guardian \u2013 occurred when Pearson, which is administering the test, posted the papers a day early on a site for test markers. Dozens of markers \u2013 mainly primary school teachers \u2013 are thought to have accessed the material, meaning that the answers could have been recorded and then passed around. The DfE confirmed that the test paper and answers had been uploaded to the site. The site was taken offline on Monday evening.

We are urgently investigating this breach. \u201cThe site can only be accessed by Pearson\u2019s approved markers, all of whom are under secure contract. Any distribution of materials constitutes a clear breach of that contract.\u201d The spokesman said the latest leak differed from the leak discovered last month that led to the key stage 1 spelling and grammar test for year two primary pupils being cancelled.  \u201cUnlike the key stage 1 test, we have no evidence to suggest this was leaked into the public domain by the time schools began to administer it. The integrity of the test has not been compromised and schools should and must deliver it as planned,\u201d the DfE said.  Labour accused the DfE of compromising the test, which was already a subject of national protests last week by parents concerned that primary-age pupils were being placed under too much pressure. Authors including Philip Pullman claimed the tests were too demanding. It is the second time in three weeks that the department has been embarrassed in its attempts to impose tougher Spag tests on primary school pupils. Last month, the scheduled Spag test for six- and seven-year-olds at key stage 1 had to be scrapped after the DfE\u2019s testing agency mistakenly included the actual test paper within a bundle of practice material published three months earlier. Lucy Powell, Labour\u2019s education spokeswoman, called for an emergency review of the assessment programme, and said the leaked tests \u201ccall into question the ability of ministers in the department to properly manage our education system\u201d, as well as undermining parent and teacher confidence. \u201cThe failure to ensure integrity in primary assessment lies at the door of education ministers who have meddled in the primary curriculum on personal whim, causing chaos and confusion in the system with their constant chopping and changing,\u201d Powell said. The DfE\u2019s decision to press on with the tests despite the breach brought a withering response from the major teaching unions. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the latest leak was a \u201cdisaster\u201d for teachers and pupils. \u201cAfter months of confusion and mismanagement, they mark the dismal culmination of a dreadful year for primary pupils and their teachers. They constitute an experience which must never be repeated; those who have engineered it must be held to account,\u201d Blower said. Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the blunder called into question the DfE\u2019s ability to administer important examinations.

Yours, NAHT\"  https://t.co/0IsLCgfheF\u2014 Russell Hobby (@russellhobby) May 10, 2016    \u201cWe cannot see how school level results can be published or a national benchmark set on such shaky data,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government may be tempted to pass this off as human error. It is not. Massive, rushed and chaotic reforms have eroded confidence, consent and capacity. It is time to stop.\u201dChris Keates, the general secretary of the NASUWT, said the tests should not be used to judge school performance, and called for an urgent review by the government into the mishandling. \u201cGiven the high-stakes nature of the testing for teachers and school leaders, if the integrity of the tests cannot be guaranteed then it is absolutely clear that they cannot be used to judge the performance of schools,\u201d he said.",
