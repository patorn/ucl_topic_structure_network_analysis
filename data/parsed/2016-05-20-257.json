I spoke to five US agencies (large and small) to get their insights. Brands must be authentic Authenticity is a key word for Joe Cecere in 2016. The president and CEO at Minneapolis-based agency Little says that organisations are becoming more eager to connect with customers by telling what he calls their \u201ctrue story\u201d \u2013 one that defines their purpose. \u201cConsumers are getting more savvy and knowledgeable about what brands stand for \u2013 and brands are understanding that consumers will react really fast if they sense any kind of insincerity or that their purpose isn\u2019t defined,\u201d he says.    Related: Marketing experts on how to achieve more creative and ambitious work    But people have always appreciated honesty, so why now? The level of competition in most industries has reached the point where there are few differentiators left, suggests Cecere. That throws the authenticity of company messaging into sharp focus. Millennials (broadly defined as the generation born from the early 1980s to the mid-90s) are also driving this move to transparency. \u201cThey\u2019ve been raised to understand the background of things. They\u2019re going to dig more,\u201d he says. So what does this mean in practical terms? \u201cThe story has to be consistent,\u201d Cecere says. \u201cThe brand has to show up the same way, whatever the touchpoint.\u201d View the past through a contemporary lens A clear, powerful message can be difficult for brands to find in a world with so many different voices and icons, warns Alain Sylvain, founder and chief executive of New York-based brand strategy consulting firm, Sylvain Labs. \u201cBrands today are struggling because there\u2019s no pop culture. Everything is so fragmented by technology. They don\u2019t know how to pull out a contemporary voice.\u201d Sylvain sees more opportunity in the past. If you grew up in the 1980s and 90s, mixing and matching your own shows at your own time or just watching YouTube wasn\u2019t an option. Traditional network TV was king.  Now, the icons of that era are disappearing, he says. \u201cThat means the power of celebrity is so much greater than it would have been 50 years ago.\u201d    Predictive behaviour is where we need to sharpen our capabilities  Jennifer Friese, Razorfish     There\u2019s a reason that we took the passing of David Bowie, Prince and others so hard \u2013 they\u2019re cultural linchpins in a way that celebs spawned in the post-TV era aren\u2019t, says Sylvain. \u201cIf I was a brand, I would be nostalgic. I would look to harness some of that powerful energy that TV created in the 80s and 90s and make it relevant today.\u201d He sees huge latent value in those assets if they\u2019re used in new and innovative ways (rather than just airing old Michael Jackson videos). It means examining our short-term cultural history in fresh ways. There\u2019s a reason that Straight Outta Compton, the biodrama about hip-hop group NWA, did so well, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a real fear to acknowledge history. A lot of brands say: we need to keep it contemporary for Gen Z,\u201d concludes Sylvain. \u201cBut that generation is really interested in looking at this history through a contemporary lens.\u201d Consider the quality of your message He may not follow Cecere\u2019s consistency rule, but Donald Trump is a good example of how content is still king. No one really cares what channel he\u2019s on; he pops up everywhere and always makes a splash. Love him or hate him, he\u2019s doing an excellent job of keeping people interested, says Laura Davis, managing director for Sausalito-based agency, Division of Labor. \u201cYou need to make a statement that\u2019s big and amazing and impactful,\u201d she says. Basically, drop a bombshell. It doesn\u2019t necessarily matter which channel you choose to say it on so much as what you say, Davis asserts. She has seen so many technology innovations and new distribution channels come and go, but one thing is constant: the quality of the messaging.  \u201cNo one is really going to remember that you [were] the first to do video on Instagram, or that you had the first broadcast on Periscope,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to remember what you put there. What was compelling and interesting.\u201d Agencies must be smarter with ads Advertising may be a key part of the equation, but it too is changing, warns Susan Noonan, executive director of media and analytics at Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners, which bills itself as one of the largest independent agencies on the west coast. The loud debate over adblocking is a sign that consumers are sick of unimaginative approaches to advertising online. \u201cWe had this great opportunity as an industry to create more personalised ads and be more conscious of consumer experience by personalising it \u2013 and we took advantage of it. We abused it,\u201d she says. Consequently, advertisements became more intrusive, Noonan believes. Advertisers began taking over pages and exchanging data with tens of different partners while readers are struggling to load web pages. She argues that advertisers must be more welcoming with their ads. \u201cWe need to be more conscious of that to ensure we\u2019re more seamlessly integrated into the content, whether that\u2019s through things like native advertising or being more conscious of the size of the ads that we\u2019re putting on these sites, and the number of data calls that we\u2019re making.\u201d Companies must also be more sensitive about how they personalise ads for customers, she concludes: \u201cThere\u2019s a dichotomy between consumers wanting ads that are more personalised and relevant to them, and consumers not wanting to feel spied on and creeped out.\u201d Agencies must up their data game For companies to be smarter with their advertising and targeting, they must be smarter with their data, says Jennifer Friese, western regional president at Razorfish. \u201cBrands are having to become smarter as their consumers become more digitally focused,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re asking agencies and consultancies questions that you can\u2019t answer without data.\u201d Friese says that the rise of consulting firms in the agency space has made agencies think differently about the industry. PwC, Deloitte and IBM are relatively recent entrants with huge market shares.  \u201cIt has made traditional and even digital agencies sharpen their skills and hone their expertise around data, because that\u2019s driving a lot of what clients are looking for,\u201d mused Friese. The other thing driving an enhanced focus on data is the millennial generation, which was the first to grow up with computers and web access in its homes. To serve a constantly-connected demographic focused on instant gratification, brands must use data intelligently, she asserts. \u201cBrands have an opportunity to create integration as you\u2019re walking down the street, or listening to music.\u201d  But it\u2019s no longer enough to serve their needs in the moment. \u201cInstead, brands need to forecast what their customers might need before they need it.
