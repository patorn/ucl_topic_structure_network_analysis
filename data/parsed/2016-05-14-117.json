  "body": "\u201cI\u2019m a political person,\u201d says Sidney Blumenthal, over lunch on a blooming May day in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s the political season. The Clintons are on stage.\u201d So they are. Therefore, so is he. Once an adviser to Bill Clinton, then an adviser to Hillary Clinton when she first campaigned for president, Blumenthal is now touring television studios, colleges and bookshops in support of his new book. A Self-Made Man, the first of a four-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln, was published in the US on Wednesday. \u201cThere are many Lincolns,\u201d he says, when asked why he turned from writing influential books on modern politics \u2013 The Permanent Campaign, The Clinton Wars, How Bush Rules \u2013 to such well-trodden historical ground. \u201cThe most commonly held is seen as sitting above us, in his enormous chair in his memorial of white alabaster: pure, immoveable, transcendent.  \u201cAnd none of that was possible without him being the opposite of that, a real live politician who developed in ways that I wanted to look at.\u201d Early reviews have been strong. The product of a fascination begun with a childhood visit to Springfield, 10 years in the writing, A Self-Made Man contains insights on the 16th president\u2019s speeches, marriage and career that have been hailed by leading Lincoln scholars.      Abraham Lincoln as a young politician. \u2018Pure, immoveable, transcendent.\u2019 Photograph: Time Life Pictures/Time & Life Pictures/Getty Image    It is also a terrific read, teeming with 19th-century life, from the down and dirty politics of 1830s Illinois to Lincoln\u2019s single term in Congress at the end of the 1840s. Over it all looms the problem of slavery. By the end of volume three, Lincoln will once again have solved it. Volume four will cover Lincoln\u2019s afterlife in American politics, of which Blumenthal is now a part.  But as he follows up on publication of volume one, the down and dirty politics of 2016 persist in following him around. Around our meeting, on MSNBC, CNN and CNBC, interviewers have been less eager to talk telegrams and the Mexican war than emails and Benghazi. On 11 September 2012, in the northern Libyan city, a mob attacked a consular building. Four Americans died, including US ambassador Chris Stevens. Hillary Clinton was secretary of state at the time and Blumenthal \u2013 then working for the Clinton Foundation \u2013 was sending her advice about issues including the precarious situation in Libya.  Amidst an FBI investigation of Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while in office, many of those emails are now public property. On the right, Benghazi has become a stick with which to beat Clinton as she campaigns again for the presidency.  Last summer, months before Clinton\u2019s own appearance, Blumenthal was summoned by a Republican-led House committee. His testimony, all nine and a half hours of it, has not been made public. On the promotional trail for his book, he has called for it to be released. He has also refused comment on the ongoing FBI investigation. This must be getting frustrating. On Wednesday morning, CNN gave Blumenthal seven minutes of prime time. Five were on Hillary and the emails and two on Lincoln, prefaced with a rather dismissive \u201cWhat else is there to say?\u201d     It\u2019s not an easy thing to \u2026 learn to be uninterested about caricatures of yourself  Sidney Blumenthal     Blumenthal smiles and, as with any question, chooses his words with care. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect it. I\u2019ve been through this for years and years. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m inured to it, but there it is. You expect it, particularly on cable television, these days.\u201d Blumenthal also testified to the Senate in 1999, during impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Rightwing news sites see him as some sort of pantomime villain, his words parsed relentlessly, any on-air chuckle or smile scorned with puritan zeal. \u201cYou learn how to deal with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing to \u2026 learn to be uninterested about caricatures of yourself. But that\u2019s essential in order to understand why it happens and to be able to take it. \u201cDoes it effect how I view the world or how I work? No. I just work. I write. And research. And do some politics.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 There are, as Blumenthal says, many Lincolns. It turns out one of them was him. Last summer in Rappahannock County, Virginia, in a one-off performance of The Peacemaker by James Reston Jr, Blumenthal played the president\u2019s ghost. \u201cSo Lincoln\u2019s dead,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m Lincoln. I stood on a little cliff above the stage, in costume, and every so often I would appear and declaim down towards the living actors with ominous and portentous words.

Photograph: supplied by Sidney Blumenthal    \u201cIt\u2019s a good role, being a ghost. No one can attack a ghost.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s ghost has long been said to haunt the White House. Supposedly, President Truman heard it and Winston Churchill saw it, in the latter case while naked and smoking a bedtime cigar. Blumenthal says he never did, though he might have seen Nixon\u2019s spook in the Lincoln Bedroom, praying for forgiveness. The joke is fitting, even if the assassinated president has become a tragic figure \u2013 in Blumenthal\u2019s words a kind of \u201cAmerican Christ\u201d who saved the country and was killed on Good Friday. Lincoln had a notoriously robust sense of humor; much in the early chapters of A Self-Made Man is duly hilariously funny.  At rural fairgrounds, Lincoln won debates with smutty wit. In a legislative session held in an Illinois church, he sought to deny his opponents a quorum by jumping out of a window. Challenged to a duel over an insulting editorial, he chose broadswords to take advantage of his great height, only to find out his diminutive challenger was an excellent fencer.   Blumenthal appreciates the value of a good editorial. He started his career writing on baseball and politics for Boston newspapers, and has written for the New Republic, the Washington Post, the New Yorker, Salon, the Atlantic and the Guardian. In his Lincoln book, he delights in the role of the press. Before he went to Washington, Lincoln covertly controlled a Whig paper, wrote brutal editorials anonymously and eagerly read of great speeches made in the east.    Lincoln\u2019s self-education in what we call political economy has been remarked on in the past but also overlooked       Blumenthal\u2019s experience in the politics of the press \u2013 he has consulted for the \u201cprogressive media watchdog\u201d Media Matters as well as the pro-Hillary Clinton super pac American Bridge \u2013 also means that in 2016, as the election pivots from primary to presidential, he is not remotely surprised that the reception of his political book has been colored by politics. Among Lincoln scholars this is rather like a game of tennis, shots exchanged across the net with a polite thwack and applause for well-made points. Allen Guelzo of Gettysburg College, a conservative, gave A Self-Made Man a glowing review of which Blumenthal is naturally very appreciative. But he did take exception to the contention that Lincoln, through reading the work of Henry Carey and others, believed in federal economic intervention. Lincoln\u2019s concept of political economy, Guelzo wrote, \u201cwas a very long way from a Keynesian, not to say a Clintonian concept of government\u201d.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that he wrote that,\u201d Blumenthal says, of the economic point as well as the reference to the Clintons, which is of a kind also prompted by his work on the Lincoln marriage.  \u201cIt\u2019s his point of view. This is mine and I stand by it. Lincoln\u2019s self-education in what we call political economy has been remarked on in the past but also overlooked.\u201d The role of the federal government in the economy is ever remarked upon. Four years ago, Mitt Romney insisted business needed no help. Blumenthal takes aim at a man then on the podium with Romney, now House speaker: Paul Ryan. \u201c[Lincoln\u2019s] belief in the essential role of government in the economy as part of democracy might not fit Paul Ryan\u2019s understanding of what is the party of Lincoln,\u201d he says. \u201cLincoln was not a follower of Ayn Rand. Although Trump may well be the embodiment, however a nightmare embodiment, of Ayn Rand\u2019s vision. So be careful what you wish for.   Related: American crossroads: Reagan, Trump and the devil down south    And thus we have reached, presumably by a federally maintained road, the parlous state of the so-called \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d. On Wednesday morning, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, met Ryan and other party leaders. The result was an apparent calming of troubled waters, but Blumenthal views those in the present day GOP who trumpet Lincoln with skepticism and Trump himself with disdain.  In his statement against Trump a week earlier, Ryan widened his definition of the GOP to \u201cthe party of Lincoln and Reagan and Jack Kemp\u201d. Blumenthal points out that Reagan \u201cbegan his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair, [near] where three civil rights workers were murdered, and spoke about states rights surrounded by Confederate battle flags. So the idea of the party of Lincoln [who defeated the Confederacy] and the party of Reagan is a strange bracketing.\u201d He also knew Kemp, the popular congressman from Buffalo who was Bob Dole\u2019s vice-presidential pick in 1996. He isn\u2019t buying. \u201cThere was a decency to him and openness to Jack,\u201d he says. \u201c[He] never imprinted himself on the party much.\u201d Blumenthal returns to a point he has repeated on TV and in public. On issues including immigration and the equality of all citizens, the GOP has moved a long way from the ideals of its first president. Furthermore, Lincoln became a Republican because his first party, the Whigs, tore themselves apart over politics. Casting his eye at Trump, he says: \u201cThis happened not least because of nativism, the schism and the growth of the Know Nothing Party, the so-called American Party. The Know Nothings created this ideal citizen who represented the ideal American. And he wanted to make America great again. \u201cCitizen Know Nothing had a son, named Jonathan, a pure American who had a fresh face and wore a sort of rural farmer\u2019s hat, but he was neatly turned out.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAnd so on.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 It\u2019s time for some direct political questions.  \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if I answer.\u201d Should Hillary Clinton win the presidential election, does Blumenthal expect to return to the White House? \u201cI haven\u2019t given it much thought. My position is to be here, a year from now, with volume two. I have my next few years plotted out \u2013 for four volumes at one a year, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d Famously, Lincoln\u2019s cabinet was a \u201cteam of rivals\u201d, including would-be presidents Seward, Chase and Bates. Could a President Hillary Clinton appoint, say, former Republican Utah governor Jon Huntsman as her own first secretary of state? \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that.\u201d Fair enough. But with such brutal dissension within and without the two modern parties, does Lincoln\u2019s famous magnanimity inspire any advice to the next president, whoever that may be?     Abraham Lincoln\u2019s memorial looms over three Democratic presidents and one first lady, in a picture from 2013. Photograph: Charles Dharapak/AP    \u201cWell, working with members of the other party, maybe \u2026 it depends upon who controls which house in Congress and how powerful [they are]. So we\u2019ll see. That\u2019s how it always is. \u201cBut in Lincoln\u2019s case there was a lot of personal relationships \u2026 and a lot of that has broken down. I think one of the great precipitators of the breakdown was Newt Gingrich [once House speaker, now reportedly a possible Trump VP] and Ted Cruz is his natural-born child, politically.\u201d He turns his attention to the Democratic primary, a bitter struggle in which Bernie Sanders has vowed to fight all the way to the convention. \u201cIn terms of getting along within your own party, Lincoln said once people stop attacking him, then he could work with them \u2026 He\u2019d even work with people who didn\u2019t stop attacking him, [like] his secretary of the treasury, Salmon Chase.    Lincoln offers lessons in binding a party together \u2026 I think those are good lessons for the Democrats right now       \u201cI think there are lessons in binding a party together, if you can. I think those are good lessons for the Democrats right now. I think it\u2019s likely the Democrats will come together, and I don\u2019t think there are such irretrievable differences and wounds that can\u2019t be dealt with. \u201cI remember President Clinton when he was first elected, his political team was opposed to the appointment of somebody who had been on an opposing primary campaign and had been combative. And Clinton told them to knock it off, and said: \u2018I thought we won.\u2019\u201d The meaning is implicit: in 2009, thanks to his work in the 2008 primary, the Obama administration reportedly barred Blumenthal from taking a role at the state department under Clinton. He speaks glowingly of Obama, who he says like Lincoln \u201cstands for inclusion, and the vindication of American ideals\u201d. Regarding the contest to replace Obama in the White House, to select the next man or woman to contemplate its many portraits of Lincoln, he indicates a willingness to fight the good fight. \u201c[It\u2019s] all hands on deck, all talents forward on our side.\u201d  Thinking again of Lincoln and the Whigs, torn apart over slavery, he adds: \u201cOn the Republican side? No-one knows where this story ends.  \u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning. They\u2019re under the volcano.\u201d  Sidney Blumenthal\u2019s The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln, vol I: A Self-Made Man, 1809-1849 is published in the US by Simon & Schuster",
