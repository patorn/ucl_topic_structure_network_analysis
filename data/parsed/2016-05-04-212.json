  "body": "I used to hate making decisions when I was a teenager. Not little stuff \u2013 I was great at making small choices that wouldn\u2019t have a huge impact on my life. Pizza or a cheeseburger? Rom-com or horror film? Strapless dress or cap sleeved? Those were easy. It was the big, capital letter Decisions that stressed me out. And to cut myself a bit of slack \u2013 I hadn\u2019t had to make many. So many things were decided for me when I was a teen, such as my school schedule and my extra-curricular activities, that when it came time for me to make big decisions myself, I\u2019d not had much practice. And maybe because of this, making big Decisions terrified me.     Morgan Matson: procrastination queen. But not any more!    They scared me so much that I made the brilliant move of avoiding making them for as long as possible. I took procrastination about making big Decisions \u2013 like where to attend university, or choosing what classes to take \u2013 to an art form. And usually, by not making a decision, things would end up getting decided for me. For example, I couldn\u2019t get into a certain class because I\u2019d waited too long to try and get in\u2026so that was a choice I didn\u2019t have to make myself. And if I wasn\u2019t happy with the outcome, I could just blame circumstances! It wasn\u2019t my fault, after all.   Related: The Unexpected Everything by Morgan Matson \u2013 review    It wasn\u2019t until after a few years of this that I realised\u2026not making a decision is actually the same thing as making a decision. Except much worse, because you\u2019re just running against the clock and then having to take what comes your way, as opposed to choosing what you want for your life, yourself. Because it\u2019s scary to have to do that! But I remember the moment when I realised how empowering it could be. I was in my second year of university, and I was feeling like I needed to take a step back. I had gone straight from my high school to college and not taken a gap year. At the time I didn\u2019t know to describe it like this, but I was burnt out. I wasn\u2019t excited about my classes, I wasn\u2019t sure if my major was a good fit for me, and it felt like I was just wasting time and money. And rather than just letting the clock run out, and wasting my last two years of university, I made a Decision. A big one.   Related: The Unexpected Everything by Morgan Matson \u2013 review    I decided I wanted to take a year away from studying. I\u2019d get a job, and I\u2019d be in the real world for a while. And it was the best decision I could have made. I got a job in the children\u2019s department of a bookstore, and fell in love with young adult literature. I started reading all the YA I could get my hands on and, at night, I started attempting to write my own book. I got a taste of the real world \u2013 of life without a meal plan or parental support \u2013 and saw just how easy I\u2019d had it up until that point. I got a much-needed dose of perspective. When I returned to school the following fall, it was with a new focus on English and creative writing. And five years later, my first YA book was published.   Related: The Unexpected Everything by Morgan Matson \u2013 review    Making that big a decision was absolutely the scariest thing I\u2019d done up to that point. But it was my decision, and even if it turned out badly, I knew that I would have made it for myself\u2026I wasn\u2019t letting someone else, or circumstances, make it for me. Big decisions are scary \u2013 but maybe they should be. Maybe they\u2019re scary so that you pause and think about them, and consider what\u2019s at stake. But when you\u2019re confronted with a big decision, the best advice I can give is to take a deep breath, and look it square in the face. And then you get to decide.       Morgan Matson\u2019s debut YA, Amy & Roger\u2019s Epic Detour, was shortlisted for the Waterstones children\u2019s book prize 2012. She has since written Second Chance Summer, Since You\u2019ve Been Gone and The Unexpected Everything. Mor\u00adgan lives in Los Angeles. Buy The Unexpected Everything at the Guardian bookshop.",
