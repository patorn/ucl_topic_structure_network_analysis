Dyer, on loan from Swansea City, has not started a league game for Leicester nor scored another league goal but this telling contribution lifted the team to second. \u201cThe goal is to stay in the Premier League,\u201d Claudio Ranieri cautioned. \u201cIt\u2019s not March or April, only September. Afterwards we can dream but not now.\u201d Vardy the record breaker Leicester City 1-1 Manchester United, 28\u00a0November 2015 Only a point gained in Leicester\u2019s remarkable march to the title but two things stood out: first, that the unlikeliest dreams can come true, with Jamie Vardy breaking the record for scoring in consecutive Premier League games, four years after he was playing non-league football for Fleetwood; second, that the unity in the team was beyond the ordinary. Christian Fuchs, who set up Vardy\u2019s goal, told the Observer of the scenes that followed: \u201cWhen the guys were standing together at the far corner celebrating, there was such an electrifying atmosphere. It was like: \u2018Wow.\u2019 I can still feel it now.\u201d Schmeichel\u2019s save Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Leicester City, 13\u00a0January 2016 Might the season have taken a different course had Kasper Schmeichel not made an impressive stop to deny Harry Kane with the game goalless? The goalkeeper pulled off several important saves at White Hart Lane but there was a game-changing feel to the moment when he rushed off his line and spread himself to deflect Kane\u2019s effort on to the bar with just over an hour gone. Robert Huth went on to head the only goal for Leicester and Ranieri was asked how it felt to have his team touted as champions. \u201cI laugh,\u201d he replied. If Tottenham had won this game and every other result this season had stayed the same, Spurs would trail Leicester by one point.

His expertly taken goal \u2013 a skip over Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, a shimmy inside Mart\u00edn Demichelis and a powerful shot past a wrongfooted Joe Hart \u2013 put Leicester 2-0 up and there was no coming back for a vapid Manchester City. This meeting of first against second turned out to be a mismatch as Leicester, for whom Huth scored twice, stretched their lead at the top. \u201cTo score three goals at City is not easy,\u201d Mahrez said in April. \u201cIt was 3-0 and ended up 3-1. That was when we started doing something big.\u201d Ranieri\u2019s bench mark Watford 0-1 Leicester City, 5\u00a0March 2016 Leicester, two points ahead of Tottenham at kick-off, were finding the going tough at Vicarage Road. Watford played the better football in the first half, though Vardy had the game\u2019s best chance, and Ranieri turned Tinkerman to excellent effect at the interval. Off went Shinji Okazaki and Marc Albrighton, on came Andy King and Jeffrey Schlupp, and the changes to personnel and formation brought the desired outcome. Mahrez got the decisive goal in the 56th minute and a tricky assignment had been transformed into a deserved win. Ranieri continued to play down title talk but added tellingly: \u201cWe aren\u2019t nervous, our job is done.\u201d Keeping Saints at arm\u2019s length Leicester 1-0 Southampton, 3\u00a0April 2016 Sadio Man\u00e9 looked certain to put Southampton ahead after latching on to Graziano Pell\u00e8\u2019s pass and moving beyond Schmeichel but his shot was blocked by the retreating Danny Simpson\u2019s right arm. \u201cSimpson\u2019s a penalty and a red card,\u201d Southampton\u2019s manager, Ronald Koeman, said. The referee gave neither and Leicester went on to record a fifth 1-0 victory in six games thanks to Wes Morgan\u2019s goal. It stretched their lead to seven points. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a magical season,\u201d Ranieri said.

Leonardo Ulloa kept his cool and the draw felt to Leicester like a win. \u201cUnbelievable, fantastic, amazing,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cWe showed this season everything is possible with the Foxes. We never hide. This is more important than one point. Psychologically it says: \u2018We are there.\u2019\u201d",
