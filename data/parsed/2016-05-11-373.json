  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull made four personal appearances in four Queensland seats on Tuesday. He must, Queensland is capricious \u2013 the state government can have a nine seat opposition one day and be electorally annihilated the next, and the Coalition has many marginal seats there to defend.  Queensland also has a jobs problem. In seats like Herbert, which covers Townsville, unemployment is over 10%, youth unemployment is pushing 20%, Indigenous unemployment is nearing 30%. Anxiety about unemployment dominates the concerns of so many voters in so many electoral battlegrounds for the Coalition that their election slogan of \u201cjobs and growth\u201d is one Turnbull chants like an affirmative mantra.    Related: Australian election 2016: Coalition questioned over superannuation changes \u2013 politics live    But as any recovered hippie knows, chanting alone is not enough; in his four-seat tour, Turnbull did a lot of talking, but he did not make a single policy announcement.  If there is any discernible progression from the Abbott era to the Turnbull one, it\u2019s that the three-word slogan has a lost the need for a verb. \u201cAxe the tax\u201d and \u201cstop the boats\u201d may have been reprehensible in intent but at least they contained a commitment to do something. In his election-calling stump speech, Turnbull mentioned a Liberal \u201cplan\u201d for the Australian economy 22 times but the \u201cplan\u201d turned out to be nothing more than the cut in the rate of corporate tax that nearly 600 major corporations are managing to avoid anyway.  It\u2019s this commitment that lays bare \u201cjobs and growth\u201d as a slogan as cynical as it is spurious. A comprehensive study from the University of Bath across no less than 19 industrialised countries revealed it\u2019s actually by raising corporate taxation that a government can assist a market-based economy\u2019s provision of job growth. A tax increase of 10% is associated with a drop of a whole 2.1 percentage points in the unemployment rate.  The problem is that the ideological fabric of the Liberal party is not woven from the ideas that can and do create jobs. Turnbull spruiks \u201cinnovation\u201d as the engine of enterprise but can\u2019t commit to investment in either a state-resourced education system that incubates it, nor to a government-funded CSIRO that fosters investigations beyond an immediate commercial goal. With repeated insistence that they wish to reduce the government\u2019s percentage share of the economy, the Liberals are opting out of the demonstrably best way to create jobs, which is for the government itself to invest in infrastructure projects and employ people to work in them.  I called the economist Richard Denniss from the Australia Institute to hear his analysis of Turnbull\u2019s infrastructure policy. He replied in one word: \u201csubmarines\u201d. He\u2019s referring to the government\u2019s reluctant commitment to build 12 new submarines in South Australia. Pragmatism trumped ideology here only because three years of offshoring of shipbuilding jobs to other counties \u2013 coupled with some insults to its workers \u2013 was going to cost the Coalition seats in South Australia. Denniss\u2019 lament for Turnbull\u2019s failure to invest in infrastructure is the subject of his recent article in The Monthly. So in lieu of using either appropriate taxation mechanisms, fostered innovation enterprise or infrastructure building to create jobs, there\u2019s a serious question any Australian voter should ask themselves when anyone from the Coalition utters \u201cjobs and growth\u201d around their staged photo ops and that is: \u201cthe growth of what kind of jobs?\u201d.  Those who were stirred by Q&A questioner Duncan Storrar\u2019s direct questioning of Liberal MP Kelly O\u2019Dwyer on Monday night should, for example, have a think about the role for him in Turnbull\u2019s plan. This is a man who, after three years of a Coalition government, is barely scraping by on a minimum wage that the Coalition have repeatedly agitated to cut.  Or you could look at the group of BRI security guards at La Trobe university taking industrial action this week, having only just discovered that they could fight the Howard-era Work Choices agreement that for nine years has been paying up to $9 less an hour than the award they were due \u2013 agreements that, again, the Liberals have been chomping to reintroduce.  You could look at the 600 Fairfax journalists who walked off their jobs to protest staff cuts and who are now threatened by the government with fines of $10,000 each \u2013 each \u2013 for doing so.    Related: The 10 big issues of election 2016: how Coalition, Labor and Greens policies compare    Does anyone imagine feeling safe on a construction site \u2013 like the one that recently collapsed in Melbourne \u2013 if the Coalition reintroduces the anti-union star-chambers of ABCC? Because what the Coalition is offering as jobs and growth have been the jobs growth they\u2019ve offered the past three years \u2013 the ones with increasing casualisation, and workplace scandals of underpayment and exploitation that have been exposed through a supply chain from Farm Workers to 7-Eleven.  We know the Liberals still want to cut penalty rates. And it should be obvious that the government paying corporations to replace available jobs paid at award with a $4 an hour labour exploitation scheme that young people will be forced into is not a mechanism for training but an entirely expendable source of renewable cheap labour, exploited in the same potentially catastrophic way as work for the dole. This is entirely what Turnbull means when he promises jobs and growth. The question for Australians is, with better, more effective alternatives not available to the Coalition imagination, are these the kind of jobs we really want to grow?",
