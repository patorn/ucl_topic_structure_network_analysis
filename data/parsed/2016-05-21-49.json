  "body": "For Laura Robson, just stepping on to a court at Roland Garros is something of a victory, but she wants a lot more than that. As the 22-year-old Londoner said before her first-round match here against the 28th seed, Andrea Petkovic: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that I can\u2019t get back to where I was, if not better, if I put the work in and do the right things.\u201d Where Robson once was \u2013 No1 in Britain, top 30 in the world, an Olympic silver medallist alongside Andy Murray, a 14-year-old junior Wimbledon champion \u2013 all seems so long ago. Now she is No302 in the world, but has a protected ranking, calculated on previous achievements, that gets her into this French Open. All of which makes her sunny disposition the more remarkable. There are plenty of players who would have crumbled and perhaps walked away from the challenge Robson\u2019s stressed-out wrists visited upon her from the moment she had to retire during her first-round match against Yanina Wickmayer in Hobart in January 2014. Since then, she has seen more doctor\u2019s surgeries than tennis courts, but she thinks the suffering is over. She last had pain in her wrists at the start of the year. Finally, she can wind up her powerful arms and put maximum force through those frightening groundstrokes. What Robson needs now are a few wins to bolster her self-belief. \u201cMy wrist is fine. I\u2019m hitting it as hard as I always did,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to play a little bit more consistently, but there have not been any changes due to injuries. It took a long time. Even at the US Open last year I wasn\u2019t hitting through it like I did before. I just had to keep getting on the practice court every day and get that confidence back. \u201cIt has been a while. I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m overly far away. I had opportunities against Vika [Azarenka in Madrid] and in every match I played, especially in Miami against [Kirsten] Flipkens, set points and everything. \u201cI think it\u2019s always been mental. You can be the fittest player in the world, but if you are not there mentally then it\u2019s extremely hard to do well. Getting that confidence has been a long, long process and it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Was there an upside to being away from the Tour for awhile? She laughs and shakes her head, then says: \u201cI saw my friends and my family much more than I had in the past. And I got a cat. But, no, I would have preferred to have been on Tour the whole time. It was a sucky situation. \u201cYou have to adjust your expectations. Like my coach is very positive and everyone around me is very happy that I\u2019m just playing, whereas I\u2019m like: \u2018I\u2019m still losing guys.\u2019 So you have to just adjust in that way. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any doubts with my wrist since the start of the year and that was the last time I had pain. Since then, I haven\u2019t worried about it. I\u2019m still doing rehab four times a week but I\u2019m going to be doing that for the rest of my life. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to get back on court every day. That was always the issue. I was able to play once and then take five days off because I still felt pain. So it\u2019s nice being able to plan a schedule because you know nothing is going to happen. When I was still in a cast, that was not fun because it went above the elbow and I couldn\u2019t tie my hair up or anything. My brother had to do that for me for a while. \u201cIt was a really long process with a lot of doctors and way more cortisone than anyone should have. We aren\u2019t talking a huge amount. I\u2019m sure footballers are getting it more because they have to play every weekend. We weren\u2019t silly with it, the doctors, especially my doctor, is very cautious with it. \u201cIt was a struggle but it has made me a more positive person in the long run and I\u2019m just happy to be here. My mum and dad and my family kept me sane. They weren\u2019t ever concerned that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get back. Everybody around me was pretty positive about it. I had a good group of people helping me along. \u201cI\u2019ll play the smaller tournaments again once my protected ranking runs out. It\u2019s fine though. I\u2019ve played all of them before. You\u2019re more excited to be at a slam as opposed to a 50 in France or somewhere, but it has to be done. There\u2019s no way around it. There\u2019s no short cut to getting your ranking back up.\u201d",
