  "body": "Leicester City have completed one of the most remarkable stories in the history of English football by winning the Premier League title. Written off as relegation candidates at the start of the season, when the bookmakers made Leicester 5,000-1 outsiders to be crowned champions, they secured the first top-flight title in the club\u2019s history after Tottenham were unable to beat Chelsea on Monday night.

They drew 2-2, handing Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side the prize. After flying back to England on Monday night having had lunch in Italy with his 96-year-old mother, Ranieri said: \u201cI\u2019m so proud. I\u2019m happy for my players, for the chairman, for the staff at Leicester City, all our fans and the Leicester community. It\u2019s an amazing feeling and I\u2019m so happy for everyone. I never expected this when I arrived.\u201d It is an incredible tale on so many levels, not least the fact that Leicester were so nearly relegated from the Premier League last season. They spent 140 days at the bottom of the table and looked set for an immediate return to the Championship until they won seven of their last nine matches under Nigel Pearson to climb clear of the bottom three.

Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images    When Ranieri took over from Pearson in the summer his appointment was widely mocked. Ranieri mentioned only a few weeks ago that he was aware he had been installed as the favourite to be the first Premier League manager to be sacked yet, in keeping with his image, the Italian never returned fire on his critics. Instead, he quietly went about the job of transforming Leicester into title challengers, only admitting that they were in the race four matches before the end of the season. He changed their targets step by step, from getting to 40 points, qualifying for Europe and securing their place in the Champions League group stage, and now the final box \u2013 doing the unthinkable and winning the league \u2013 has been ticked off.

Their captain, Wes Morgan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling of my career and I couldn\u2019t be prouder that it\u2019s as part of this team. Everyone\u2019s worked so hard for this, nobody believed we could do it, but here we are, Premier League champions and deservedly so.\u201d It is a narrative that belongs to a different era \u2013 Nottingham Forest, in 1978, were the last first-time winners \u2013 and means that Ranieri, at the age of 64, has finally won a major league. He finished second in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2004 and was twice a runner-up in Serie A, and once in Ligue 1. Now the man Jos\u00e9 Mourinho described in 2008 as having \u201cthe mentality of someone who doesn\u2019t need to win\u201d has a Premier League title on his CV.",
