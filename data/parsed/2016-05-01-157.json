  "body": "The cycle of infidelity can be broken with forgiveness, Beyonc\u00e9 implies \u2013 but not before she breaks stuff    It\u2019s unlikely there will be many more albums this year that will unite high art and low in the same way as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s jaw-slackening latest. Stealth-released like its predecessor, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s self-titled visual album of 2013, Lemonade was expected to be political, trailed as it was by February\u2019s polemical Formation, and a paradigm-shifting Super Bowl half-time performance with Black Pantherised dancers. Black lives continue to matter on Lemonade \u2013 Formation, still startling, is included; Malcolm X is sampled and Trayvon Martin\u2019s mother makes an appearance \u2013 but Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s political bent takes a back seat to personal matters; these are, though, expansively contextualised. The album\u2019s title comes from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 90-year-old grandmother-in-law, Hattie White, who endorsed the old epigram that since life served her lemons, she made lemonade; a testament to female endurance and pragmatism. What unfolds is an album about male-pattern infidelity and female self-examination. That cycle can be broken with forgiveness, Beyonc\u00e9 implies \u2013 but not before she breaks stuff with a baseball bat on Hold Up. With a sassy dancehall lilt, Beyonce unexpectedly quotes a Yeah Yeah Yeahs track, a cocktail of warmth and fury. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, looking jealous or crazy?\u201d she wonders. She appears, for half of the album, to be as mad as hell at Jay Z. It is tremendous.   Related: Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade is #blackgirlmagic at its most potent    At its basest level, then, Lemonade is a gossip rag, as art-directed by a Vogue stylist who\u2019s smoked the budget. In a series of sumptuous vignettes, in which Serena Williams gyrates (on the electrifying Sorry) and a range of other famous black female figures make visual cameos, Beyonc\u00e9 appears to launder her business in public. Rumours of a rift in the marriage ricocheted around the internet in 2014 after Solange Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hipper little sister, attacked Jay Z in a lift. Now Beyonc\u00e9 names names (\u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d), regrets the ring, and threatens to leave if he \u201ctry that shit again\u201d. So far, so daytime-TV. The songs, though, are not just prurient catnip, but actual dynamite \u2013 a dazzling series of edgy, but tuneful collaborations with a diverse array of guests. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hurt is articulated magnificently, often quoting Somali-British poet Warsan Shire, who doesn\u2019t mince words like \u201cmenses\u201d. You can hear the confident hand of Jack White on the superb digital-analogue confection Don\u2019t Hurt Yourselfcorrect where Beyonc\u00e9 unleashes a righteous hip-hop blues-woman holler. Even heavier and more freaky with organ is Freedom, a declaration of intent that features a typically electrifying Kendrick Lamar verse. The tail end finds Beyonc\u00e9 reconciled with the man she still loves \u2013 paving the way for Lemonade to be previewed on Tidal, Jay Z\u2019s streaming service. Cynics will cry foul, that Beyonc\u00e9 remains an entitled superstar, raging at a paper tiger. Those cynics will be ignoring one of this year\u2019s finest albums.",
