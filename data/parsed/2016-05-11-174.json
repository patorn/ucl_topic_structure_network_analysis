  "body": "The Chicago Cubs. The Buffalo Bills. Their names are synonymous with heartbreak, through decades of mediocrity punctuated by agonizing near-misses.   Related: The offside rule is ruining the NHL playoffs \u2013 and the mess could get worse    One name to add to that list: the Washington Capitals, ousted from the NHL playoffs Tuesday night by their perennial nemesis, the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Caps had the best regular-season record in the league for the second time in seven years, but they\u2019ll miss the last two rounds of the playoffs. Like the Cubs and Bills, the Caps have been atrocious at times. As an expansion team in 1974-75, they won eight games, tied five and lost 67 \u2013 some by epic margins (1-11 v Montreal, 1-12 at Boston, 0-10 at Montreal, 1-12 at Pittsburgh) unheard of in today\u2019s NHL. They didn\u2019t make the playoffs until their ninth season, somehow missing the postseason tournament even when it accepted 16 of the league\u2019s 21 teams. Sporadic success followed \u2013 first place in the Patrick Division in 1988-89, the conference finals in 1989-90. In 1996, young goaltender Jim Carey won the Vezina Trophy, but he was pulled out of the playoff series (a loss to the Penguins), then promptly faded out of the sport. Two seasons later, they made an improbable run to the Stanley Cup finals, where they were swept. Even in their best seasons, they had more grit than flair. Two seasons after the Cup run, journeymen pugilist Chris Simon led the Caps in goals with 29 as they finished first in their division \u2013 and lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Penguins. But the turn of the century brought change, the kind promised but rarely delivered by the politicians that descend upon DC. New owner Ted Leonsis, an affable America Online executive, made an effort to connect with fans to improve the home atmosphere. And the financial cushion he provided brought the league\u2019s leading scorer, Jaromir Jagr, to Washington \u2026 from the Penguins. This is also where your long-suffering correspondent joins the story, having married a Caps fan and moved to DC\u2019s Virginia suburbs. The NHL managed to remove a team from my childhood state of Georgia not once but twice, so transferring my loyalties wasn\u2019t difficult. I started humming the Caps\u2019 unofficial anthem \u2013 Marilyn Manson\u2019s ironically titled The Beautiful People \u2013 and cheering for a bunch of scrappy guys ready to take the NHL by storm. But the Capitals didn\u2019t even win the weak Southeast Division during Jagr\u2019s tenure, and they sank back to the bottom of the league. Jagr made the Stanley Cup finals in 2013 with the Boston Bruins, and he continues to skate on into his 40s, a spectre of what might have been. A ray of light appeared in 2005 with the arrival of gap-toothed Russian sensation Alex Ovechkin. He took the Calder Trophy for the league\u2019s top rookie, besting much-hyped Canadian Sidney Crosby \u2026 of the Penguins. In Ovechkin\u2019s third season, 2007-08, the Caps made a dramatic late surge to win the Southeast and get back into the playoffs. They followed up with a 50-win season, then the Presidents\u2019 Trophy (best regular-season record) in 2009-10.  But 2010 just brought the biggest heartbreak yet. The Caps were cruising in the first round of the playoffs, leading 3-1, when the league\u2019s top offense suddenly sputtered against Montreal goalie Jaroslav Halak. The Caps remained Southeast powers and playoff perennials for three more seasons but didn\u2019t advance past the second round of the playoffs. When the NHL realigned once more for the 2013-14 season, they sank to fifth in the difficult Metropolitan Division (won by \u2026 the Penguins) despite the late \u201ccan\u2019t beat \u2018em, buy \u2018em\u201d signing of Halak. Things are supposed to be different now. The Caps brought in well-respected head coach Barry Trotz and promoted Brian MacLellan to general manager in 2014. In Trotz\u2019s first season, Ovechkin led the league in goals, Nicklas Backstrom led the league in assists, and the Caps were two minutes away from their first conference final since 1998. The Rangers \u2013 at least it wasn\u2019t the Penguins \u2013 scored late to tie Game 5, won in overtime and took the last two games of the series. This year, the Caps made a massive deal with St Louis to bring in TJ Oshie. They landed Justin Williams in free agency. They broke the bank to keep star goalie Braden Holtby. They won the Presidents\u2019 Trophy again \u2013 and this time, no one could accuse them of padding their record against the weak Southeast. In England, everyone\u2019s singing the praises of Leicester City, the soccer team that broke the big clubs\u2019 stranglehold on the Premier League this year. No one cares that they lost in the early rounds of the FA Cup. But in the USA, we do playoffs. They\u2019re usually fair in sports like football and basketball, where top teams win 70-80% of their games and go on to postseason success. They\u2019re less fair in baseball and hockey, where teams that squeak into the bloated brackets can win a league championship. The Presidents\u2019 Trophy in particular is a curse. The 2010 Capitals were neither the first nor the last Presidents\u2019 winners to lose in the first round of the playoffs. And the Capitals themselves \u2013 like the Cubs, the Bills or the pre-2004 Boston Red Sox \u2013 must be cursed. Maybe it\u2019s the curse of Jagr. Maybe it\u2019s because the team was launched in the shadow of Watergate. Maybe it\u2019s because the rest of the country\u2019s politicians go back to their constituents and tell them how evil \u201cWarshington\u201d is, and that mindset seeps into the confidence of the city\u2019s athletes. (Or the NHL\u2019s refs.) But it\u2019s still a great time to be a Caps fan. In this mess of a metropolis, where the subway system is on the verge of closure and the roads are clogged, the Washington Capitals have managed to instill some civic pride. Out in the suburbs, you see more and more street hockey goals, and lots of Capitals magnets or stickers on SUVs and minivans. And we trade stories of going to games and seeing Ovie, Oshie, Backstrom, Holtby and new phenom Evgeny Kuznetsov. Go to a Caps game, and you\u2019ll see some beautiful hockey in front of a spirited red-clad crowd packed to the rafters. And from those rafters, you can look across at all the Southeast Division and Presidents\u2019 Trophy banners. Maybe one day, a more meaningful banner will hang there as well. Does anyone know how to lift a curse? The Cubs are off to a great start, so anything\u2019s possible. Right?",
