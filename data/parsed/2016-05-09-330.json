  "body": "First excursions on to eBay often tend toward the modest. A pair of shoes, a coffee table. A bicycle, at a push. Not so for Juliet Stevenson. \u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly easy to buy a double-decker bus, you know, once you start looking,\u201d says the 59-year-old actor, picking over a chicken salad in a London restaurant. \u201cI immediately discovered that a red one costs twice as much. And older ones are better, if they\u2019re working well, because the parts aren\u2019t as complicated. There\u2019s less to go wrong.\u201d All this is said in a helpful manner, as though she has heard I might be in the market for a bus myself and is determined I make an informed purchase. Celebrities are permitted their indulgences. Johnny Depp has an island. Rupert Grint owns an ice-cream van. Juliet Stevenson\u2019s bus, however, cannot be written off as an eccentricity. After visiting the Calais refugee camp in February, she asked one of the volunteers what was needed. The surprising answer was that a double-decker would go down a treat. \u201cThere are hundreds of kids in the camp,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou can take the seats out of the upper deck, turn it into a dormitory, and it can also be a day centre. It\u2019s warm, dry, safe. No one can knock it down and, if necessary, it can be driven away.\u201d Within a few weeks of returning, she and a friend had snapped up a blue bus for \u00a35,500 and driven it to the camp.    \u2018As you get older, the roles narrow. It\u2019s like being on the up escalator waving to my actress self going down: Bye!\u2019    She is keenly aware that the tabloid press never knowingly gives a break to posh liberal celebrities. Has she come in for any luvvie-bashing? \u201c\u2018Luvvie\u2019,\u201d she shudders. \u201cNow there\u2019s a word I\u2019d like to ban. Generally the press hates people like Emma [Thompson] and Jude [Law] and myself for doing these things. It\u2019s the very same media desperately craving stories about well-known people who are then the ones to slag us off for wanting to help.\u201d As if on cue, the director Stephen Daldry pops over to our table to give Stevenson the latest update on his own efforts to get a theatre going at the camps. Were a tabloid photographer in the vicinity, this snapshot of two luvvies saving the world over lunch might be worth a pretty penny. Still, Stevenson is fairly sure that \u201ceven the Mail would have a hard time saying there\u2019s anything wrong with rescuing children living in mud and shit\u201d.     Stevenson in her new film, Departure.    Word is that the bus has been a big success. \u201cI\u2019ve got a young film-maker out there filming what\u2019s going on for fundraising purposes. He sent back footage at the weekend of children on the top deck watching Mary Poppins.\u201d She sounds genuinely moved \u2013 not easy given she has to practically holler to be heard over the boisterous lunchtime trade. But then Stevenson has always been able to embody apparently contradictory qualities. She is tall and, at times, indomitable-looking. (\u201cI do think tall women have to work harder to get sympathy. I often joke about this with some of my smaller friends.\u201d) And yet her best work has involved devastating displays of vulnerability. Her screen breakthrough was the bittersweet 1990 romcom Truly, Madly, Deeply, in which she alternated authentically messy tears and radiant laughter as a grieving woman whose partner returns as a ghost. She was offered a part in Schindler\u2019s List on the strength of it. \u201cI was in the bath and my mum called through the door: \u2018Darling, there\u2019s a Steven Spielberg on the phone.\u2019 \u2018God that\u2019s hilarious mum!\u2019 \u2018No I really think that\u2019s his name.\u2019\u201d Only she\u2019d already committed to do a play in Los Angeles. \u201cThe tragedy of life is mistiming. I\u2019ve turned down wonderful stuff. But is there even a right or wrong? It\u2019s more like, \u2018That\u2019s what I did. I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019\u201d     \u2018Tall women have to work harder to get sympathy\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    The LA trip had been at the insistence of her agent. \u201cI went a bit reluctantly. I\u2019m not very good at self-promotion. So I did a play out there because I wanted to be working rather than hanging out by swimming pools trying to look nice.\u201d Then she received an offer to come home for what transpired to be her second great signature role: Paulina, the torture victim who turns the tables on her former tormentor, in Ariel Dorfman\u2019s Death and the Maiden at the Royal Court. Bang went any more LA meetings (\u201cMuch to my agent\u2019s dismay\u201d). But she did get the 1992 Olivier award for best actress. \u201cI loved doing it. A philosophical proposition that was also a thriller.\u201d It was Stevenson\u2019s idea to have Paulina shove her knickers in her torturer\u2019s mouth. \u201cIt came up in rehearsal. I think it\u2019s made its way into the stage directions now.\u201d Did she feel her Hollywood moment was over? \u201cNo. I\u2019ve done American films: Being Julia, Mona Lisa Smile. It\u2019s ticked over. And that\u2019s fine. Being flavour of the moment is not a good place to be. If you\u2019re flavour of the moment, by definition you\u2019ll be the bad taste of the moment in five years\u2019 time.\u201d Her career \u2013 a model of longevity \u2013 bears this out. In 2014 she brought formidable pluck and cheer to the partially entombed Winnie in Beckett\u2019s Happy Days. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Billington called her interpretation \u201cbrilliantly intelligent\u201d.      Up to her hips \u2026 as Winnie in Happy Days by Samuel Beckett in 2014. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    Her range is exploited well in the new British drama Departure, in which she plays a newly single woman clearing out her French holiday home, with her teenage son. With her husband gone and her son on the cusp of leaving home, she has to face her own incompleteness. \u201cEverything has been motivated by and structured around their child. He reaches adolescence, and then \u2026 well, they leave you. They don\u2019t leave you for good. I\u2019ve got children myself [Rosalind, 22, and Gabriel, 15, with her husband, the anthropologist Hugh Brody] so I\u2019ve been through this. There\u2019s a necessary and painful letting go.\u201d The film is striking for giving a middle-aged woman unpredictable notes to play. \u201cFemale roles are often not complex because they\u2019re adjuncts,\u201d Stevenson sighs. \u201cVery often the interesting things happen to the man. The woman is there as wife, mother, daughter, PA. A lot of writers won\u2019t give you your own narrative because it isn\u2019t deemed necessary. So much in our culture about women\u2019s identities relates to their sexual value. When that is no longer of interest they, as individuals, are past the point of being of any interest either. It\u2019s a source of frustration. As you get older, you get more experience, you have more to say, more layers. And at exactly the same time that\u2019s happening in your life, the roles are narrowing down. It\u2019s like you\u2019re on the up escalator but the parts are on the down escalator. You\u2019re waving to your actress self: \u2018Byeee!\u2019\u201d     \u2018Female roles are often not complex because they\u2019re adjuncts\u2019 \u2026 with Michael Byrne in Death and the Maiden by Ariel Dorfman. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    As a young performer, the pickings weren\u2019t as slim. \u201cI got offered a wide range in my 20s and 30s. My only hand on the rudder through all that was to to try not to get pinned down as one thing. After Truly, Madly, Deeply, I got many wacky, daffy, quirky single women, trying to cope in their daft, loveable way. But I\u2019d done that. I need the insecurity of not knowing where I\u2019m going.\u201d  Born in Essex, Stevenson had an itinerant childhood. Her father\u2019s job in the army uprooted the family every few years; there were spells in Germany, and at boarding school in Berkshire. She studied at Rada and got roped into the RSC in 1978, when she was 22. \u201cI was an unhatched egg that had just rolled out of drama school. But someone fell sick in The Tempest and they needed a replacement quickly. They grabbed my coat and suitcase off me when I arrived in Stratford, rushed me into the wings and said, \u2018Do whatever she does!\u2019\u201d \u2018She\u2019 turned out to be Ruby Wax. \u201cIf she barked, I barked.\u201d     Departure: watch an exclusive trailer for the new British drama \u2013 video   The production had its shortcomings. \u201cIt had all been designed around laser beams. Only they never worked.\u201d But it was invaluable for another reason: it introduced her to Alan Rickman, with whom she later starred in Truly, Madly, Deeply and on stage in the legendary 1986 RSC production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses.    \u2018Many hundreds of people in this profession owe their careers to Alan Rickman\u2019    \u201cI\u2019d seen Alan playing King Rat in Dick Whittington at Bristol rep and I thought, \u2018That is one sexy, charismatic actor\u2019. He befriended Ruby and me, little sprogs that we were. Ruby was so funny, and he told her: \u2018Write it down.\u2019 They stayed best friends. She wouldn\u2019t brush her teeth without ringing Alan first.\u201d To Stevenson, he was like a big brother. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t happy in Truly:\u2018I can\u2019t snog my brother!\u2019 I\u2019d sometimes drive him mad, occasionally vice versa. But it was an unconditionally loving friendship. He came to see everything I ever did, right up to Happy Days. If you wanted notes, there\u2019d be a whole list after and they\u2019d be brilliant. I can hear his voice in my head: \u2018Get off the front foot, on to the back foot. Jules, less is more\u2019.\u201d     With Alan Rickman in Truly, Madly, Deeply. Photograph: Allstar/BBC    She doesn\u2019t need to say she misses Rickman. The loss resonates every time she mentions him. \u201cNobody scared me more in the audience because I minded so much what he thought. I\u2019m a mother of grown-up children but it was like I was 20 years old needing his approval.\u201d About his legacy, she is clear. \u201cHe collected talent around him, nurturing it, giving people opportunities. You would come into your own working with him. \u2018What you need is this script editor\u2019 or \u2018What you need is this director\u2019. He\u2019d hook you up. Many hundreds of people probably owe their careers to Alan. There was no one else like him.\u201d  Departure is released 20 May.",
