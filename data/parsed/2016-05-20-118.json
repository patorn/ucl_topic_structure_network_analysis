  "body": "Hometown: Vancouver.  The lineup: Tommy Genesis (vocals, music).  The background: Before we even get to the music, we lov Tommy Genesis. For starters, what a great name that is. It sounds like Domo Genesis of Odd Future, our favourite group of the decade. It completely fails to place the musician in question sexually or otherwise, and it has biblical overtones with intimations of religious provocation; of someone keen to challenge assumptions. We love her manga cute/Harajuku couture, or at least its contrast with her music which so graphically alludes to sex and is full of strident self-assertions (\u201cI never met a muthafucker that I need\u201d). Then there\u2019s the sound, which is brittle, harsh and full of cold, futuristic sonics seemingly informed by witch house, postpunk DIY electronica and the chilly clatter of ATL trap. Perhaps there\u2019s something in the water because Genesis, although from Vancouver, records for Awful Records, the Atlantan label renowned for its idiosyncratic approach in challenging the definition of hip hop.       It almost comes as a surprise to realise, beyond the conceptualising, that she\u2019s a flesh and blood person, albeit one with an intriguing backstory. Her dad is from a religious/traditional family in India, and her mum is a \u201cvery liberal-minded\u201d Scandinavian, which might explain the interrogative nature of her beliefs. She describes herself variously as a \u201cfetish rapper\u201d and \u201ca playful demon angel baby\u201d, justifying her choice of American Apparel thus: \u201cI like to wear plaid skirts because it\u2019s like walking around with a sign that says, \u2018Fuck you I\u2019m young\u2019, and I like to wear crop tops because they\u2019re really comfortable but also slightly provocative. I like combat boots because they make me feel powerful and masculine. I like to look like I could have just walked out of an anime.\u201d She used to be one half of an indie band called Moan and studied gender politics, film and sculpture at college. She has run art galleries in Vancouver and done performance art and poetry readings. If this makes her sound dilettantish, good: it means she won\u2019t be pinned down and fully intends to \u201c[traverse] media as frequently as her own moods\u201d, as Dazed Digital put it. She\u2019s a very internet-age artist. \u201cThe internet is my heritage,\u201d she says. \u201cMy cultural lens is a blurry, undefined, intimate one.\u201d Despite being signed to Awful, she reminds us of the Odd Future members at the peak of their fluid online polymathy before they got bogged down in record company politics and release dates. Polymorphously perverse, her songs are \u201cabout pussy and darkness ... pain, sex, relationships, drugs, boredom and revolt\u201d and are either self-produced or produced by Awful\u2019s father, KeithCharles Spacebar, GODMODEGAME666 and others. There is one mixtape out there \u2013 World Vision \u2013 with a sequel ready for release and a third on its way. If you like machine-hard futuristic production and glassy, zomboid vocals, you\u2019ll love tracks such as Hate Demon. Shepherd was written \u201cabout a girl who broke my heart\u201d and serves as a protean anthem, while Angelina \u2013 nominally about la Jolie \u2013 veers between the abstract and psychotic with the demented glee of early Tyler, the Creator (\u201cShe tell me he gon\u2019 flip me like he flip his cousins back South / But she don\u2019t know that I went from cunt to dick early this month\u201d). Bump (about suburban drug culture) is her minimalist apotheosis, as sparse and terse as Ariana Grande in hell remixed by 1986 Mantronix. Recently, Genesis told Complex magazine she wanted her work to \u201cbe something, not be about something\u201d. \u201cIn art theory, there\u2019s a concept called phenomenology,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s when you make art that can operate on its own. It\u2019s not something you have to sit there and explain in a critique, but something the viewer can discover. I try to apply this concept to my methodology of music-making. I don\u2019t just want to reference what\u2019s already been made, I want to make something new.\u201d We\u2019re struggling to think of firm antecedents for this music, or too many contemporary reference points, so we\u2019d have to declare ... job done.  The buzz: \u201cMeet the internet\u2019s most rebellious underground rap queen.\u201d  The truth: If Ariana Grande signed to Awful \u2026  Most likely to: Be a sacrificial lamb. Least likely to: Follow the flock.  What to buy: World Vision 2 will be released by Awful.  File next to: Angel Haze, Kitty Pryde, Future, SpaceGhostPurrp.
