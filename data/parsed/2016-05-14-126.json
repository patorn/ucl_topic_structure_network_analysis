  "body": "Kitchen taps: a lemon (39p)I cut a lemon into quarters, rub the flesh on to the tap and leave the sticky citrus coating for an hour. I rinse it off and the tap is gleaming and smells divine. This technique is so simple I immediately wonder how much I\u2019ve wasted on lemon-scented cleaning products over the years.  Verdict: 5/5    I rub the flesh on to the tap and leave the sticky citrus coating for an hour. I rinse it off and the tap is gleaming    Oven: vinegar and baking soda (\u00a31.44) Many people can\u2019t face removing the layers of grime that build up after months of chicken kiev dinners, judging by the number of oven-cleaning services advertised online. I brace myself, wipe down the inside of my oven and cover the surfaces with baking soda. I spray the walls with vinegar; it fizzes in a reassuringly scientific way. The results are good, even if it takes a fair bit of elbow grease to shift the dirt \u2013 but it\u2019s still not up to professional standards. It doesn\u2019t sparkle like the \u201cafter\u201d pictures online, but it did only cost \u00a31.44. Verdict: 4/5 Toilet: Coca-Cola (\u00a31.69)Apparently there\u2019s enough acid in Coca-Cola to clean a toilet bowl. I empty a whole bottle down the loo, and soon regret it. The sweet smell and lack of germ-killing credentials make this method feel unsanitary, not to mention expensive. I leave it for 15 minutes, scrub and flush, but I am left unconvinced. Verdict: 0/5 Water stains on wood: hairdryer and olive oil (free) White water stains can ruin wooden desks, bedside cabinets, or, in my case, an old kitchen stool used as a coffee table. One of the thin white rings miraculously disappears after five minutes of applying heat to it, while others refuse to budge. I apply a little olive oil to stop the wood drying out, but I am quickly bored. Verdict: 2/5 Bath: grapefruit and salt (65p)After the success of the lemon in the kitchen, I have high hopes for the citrus fruit\u2019s bigger cousin. The salt is supposed to act as a scouring agent on a grubby bath, so I use a fair amount and rub it in vigorously with the grapefruit. After an hour, I rinse it off using a scouring pad and, I admit, a tiny bit of soap to get rid of the pulp. I\u2019m a convert. My bath has never looked so fresh and clean. Verdict: 4/5",
