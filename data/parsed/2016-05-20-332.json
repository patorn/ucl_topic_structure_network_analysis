At Ithaa, a restaurant in the Maldives, the mission is to bring top-class dining to an underwater location. Local lobster makes the cut, but everything else is flown in for the benefit of customers who must dine barefoot, but otherwise be well-heeled. In contrast, we visit L\u2019Enclume, where Simon Rogan\u2019s hyperlocal mission means that any ingredient from outside Cumbria need not apply. John Robinson Love, Nina9.30pm, BBC1 New Nick Hornby adaptation of Nina Stibbe\u2019s book, set in a posh London crescent in the early 80s. Faye Marsay is Nina, a dungaree-clad girl from Leicester who takes a job as a nanny for George (Helena Bonham Carter) and her two verbose little boys. Nothing much happens, but gentle humour and sweet moments follow as Nina and the family settle into life together, singing football songs, worrying about nuclear war and discussing crabs around the dinner table. Hannah Verdier Mum10pm, BBC2 It\u2019s February, and Cathy\u2019s first Valentine\u2019s Day since the death of her husband. Not wanting her to be alone, her brother Derek arrives, much to the chagrin of his partner, the spiteful tact-vacuum Pauline, who obviously had something a bit more spiffy in mind and makes sure everyone knows it. Lovelorn Michael also pitches up for the same reason, and finds Cathy in possession of a mystery Valentine\u2019s card. It\u2019s subtly brilliant work from writer Stefan Golaszewski. Ben\u00a0Arnold EMI: The Inside Story10pm, BBC4 For the Sex Pistols, they were \u201cstupid fools\u201d; for many other artists, including Radiohead, who enjoyed a considerably longer relationship with them before marching off, they were simply incompetent number-crunchers, venture capitalists without a clue how to run a music business. How did this once-revered label, home to\u00a0everyone from the Beatles and Pink Floyd to Queen, lose its way so badly? The likes of Neil Tennant, Nick Mason and Roger Taylor tell\u00a0all. Ali\u00a0Catterall Bob\u2019s Burgers10pm, Comedy Central The fifth season of Fox\u2019s underrated animated comedy about a family-run fast-food joint finally makes it across the Atlantic, almost two years after its original airing in the States. In the first of a double bill, there\u2019s sibling rivalry when Gene and Tina star in rival musicals. Then it\u2019s time for an altogether spookier outing as Tina embarks on a relationship with Jeff, a ghost living in the family\u2019s basement. Brilliantly deadpan fun. Hannah J Davies No Such Thing As the News11.05pm, BBC2 This new series is based on the popular podcast No\u00a0Such Thing As a Fish, in which the researchers of QI unearth and kick around their most interesting obscure facts of the week. This spinoff applies the treatment to current events: it takes a look at the week\u2019s affairs, but in search\u00a0of interesting gems, rather than taking the usual panel show satirical broadsides. With James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Ptaszynski and Dan Schreiber. David Stubbs Live sport Test cricket: England v Sri Lanka The second day of the first Test match from Headingley. Can England build on their promising winter? 10.30am, Sky Sports 2 League One football: Millwall v Bradford City The second leg of the playoff tie, with a place at Wembley \u2013 and a spot in the Championship \u2013 up for grabs. 7.30pm, Sky Sports 1 Film choices Trainwreck (Judd Apatow, 2015) 3.45pm, 8pm, Sky Movies Premiere Amy Schumer bursts on to the screen in her star/screenwriter debut as a boozy, sexually relaxed journo called Amy. Life is a carefree frolic until she develops feelings for sports doctor Aaron (Bill Hader). Sounds like a standard romcom, but Schumer\u2019s writing and acting are subtler than that. Lots of laughs, too, and Tilda Swinton offers standout support as Amy\u2019s bossy British editor. Paul Howlett He\u2019s Just Not That Into You (Ken Kwapis, 2009) 9pm, E4 An impressive coterie of top actors take a firm grip on this thoughtful film about love and sex. There\u2019s control-freak Jennifer Connelly, seductress Scarlett Johansson, cyber-dating Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Aniston, who is painfully realising that lover Ben Affleck isn\u2019t going to marry her. All are upstaged, though, by Ginnifer Goodwin\u2019s Gigi, who can\u2019t understand why she\u2019s never asked on a second date. PH",
