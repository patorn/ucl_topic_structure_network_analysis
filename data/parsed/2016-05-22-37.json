  "body": "The 2016 presidential campaign has put Americans\u2019 gun rights \u201cin the balance\u201d, according to the former Texas governor Rick Perry.   Related: NRA lobbyist: 'Bernie's right' about lawsuits against gunmakers    \u201cI don\u2019t think this is overblown rhetoric,\u201d Perry said in an interview outside the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual convention in Louisville, Kentucky. \u201cYou know, in campaigns you do have some hyperbole. This is not hyperbole.\u201d If Hillary Clinton is elected, Perry said, she will nominate a supreme court justice willing to overturn the court\u2019s landmark 5-4 decision in District of Columbia v Heller, from 2008. In that case, the court ruled that Americans have an individual right to own firearms in the home for self-defense.  On Friday, Maya Harris, an adviser to Clinton, said the candidate believed the Heller decision was \u201cwrongly decided\u201d, as it undermined the ability of cities and states \u201cto craft commonsense laws to keep their residents safe\u201d. Supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the Heller decision, died suddenly in February. Republican leaders immediately pledged to delay the nomination of a replacement until after the 2016 election.  In endorsing presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on Friday, NRA leaders told members: \u201cThe second amendment is on the ballot in November.\u201d Trump once again turned the charge against Clinton. Perry, who ended his bid for the Republican nomination in September, has been a fierce critic of Trump. But he told CNN on Friday that he would be willing to be his vice-president.  \u201cI suspect I\u2019m going to be helping him in myriad ways,\u201d Perry said.  Asked to comment on Sunday on what he thought about Trump\u2019s endorsement by the NRA, Perry was lukewarm.  \u201cGreat, yeah, good, good show,\u201d he said.  He said he was very concerned about the future of gun rights in America. If Clinton and \u201cthe anti-gun people\u201d succeed in overturning Heller, he said, \u201cthat would jeopardize gun rights\u201d.  Any justice nominated by Clinton, Perry added, \u201cshe will give a test to, about whether or not they\u2019re going to be supporting gun rights\u201d. Though it was a huge symbolic victory for gun rights advocates, the Heller decision did not radically transform gun laws in most of America. Local handgun bans were extremely rare, thanks to the political power of the NRA and other advocates.  Since Heller, courts have left other gun control laws in place, including state bans on \u201cassault weapons\u201d. Perry said overturning Heller would still have serious implications for gun owners. \u201cWe consider that to be the nose under the camel\u2019s tent,\u201d he said. \u201cThose of us who have been in this business for a long time understand that you ratchet things one way or the other a little bit at a time.  \u201cThis is a ratcheting away from [the] second amendment right to carry freely wherever we should be able to.\u201d Asked what he thought Clinton would realistically be able to do to restrict gun rights in her first term in the White House, Perry said: \u201cNothing, because she won\u2019t be there.\u201d   The NRA refused to issue Guardian US with accreditation for its annual convention.
