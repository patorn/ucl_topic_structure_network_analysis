  "body": "The man who could on Sunday become Austria\u2019s first rightwing populist president likes to present himself as a centrist. The Austrian Freedom party (FP\u00d6), Norbert Hofer argued in a recent interview, was far from rightwing but \u201cto the left of the US Democrats\u201d. Austria, he said, was \u201cblessed\u201d not to have an extremist party like Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn. Last month, Hofer\u2019s pitch as a consensus-building reformer of Austria\u2019s static political system helped him defy the polls and gain a 35% victory in the first round of the presidential elections, leaving the candidates of the centre-left Social Democratic party (SP\u00d6) and centre-right People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP), who have shared the post between themselves since 1945, floundering in his wake.   Related: Austrian far-right party's triumph in presidential poll could spell turmoil    Now, after the resignation of the chancellor Werner Faymann, Hofer\u2019s rhetorically dexterous performances in TV debates with his rival, Alexander Van der Bellen, and a period in which neither of the two centrist parties could bring themselves to fully rally behind his sole remaining opponent, many in Austria think it is possible that the \u201cfriendly face of the FP\u00d6\u201d (Der Kurier) with the \u201cdoe eyes\u201d (Der Spiegel) will soon represent their country on the national stage. But a number of commentators warn that Hofer\u2019s persuasive oratory and natural charm have allowed him to successfully cover up an ideological background that places him on the extreme right of the political spectrum. Stefan Petzner \u2013 a protege of the late longtime FP\u00d6 leader J\u00f6rg Haider, who now works as a PR adviser to a variety of political parties \u2013 recently described Hofer as a \u201csheep in wolf\u2019s clothing, a ticking timebomb\u201d. Haider, under whom the rightwing party rose to prominence in the 90s, would not have voted for his own party\u2019s candidate, he said.  Burgenland-born Hofer, who was relatively unknown outside party circles until his nomination for the presidential post in January, was one of the key architects of the FP\u00d6\u2019s lurch to the right following a course of relative moderation during Haider\u2019s leadership.   Austria election map   Having risen up the ranks as a political adviser to Haider\u2019s successor, Heinz-Christian Strache, Hofer was tasked with rewriting the FP\u00d6 manifesto in 2011, reintroducing a \u201ccommitment to a German people and cultural community\u201d. He used a German phrase, Volksgemeinschaft, which strongly echoes the rhetoric of the Nazi era. In an interview with the Austrian far-right magazine Aula in June 2011, Hofer heralded this move as a \u201creversal of Haider\u2019s prostration\u201d, referring to the ex-leader\u2019s toning down of overtly nationalist rhetoric before joining government in 1999. \u201cIt looks odd when people deny their own roots,\u201d he said. When taken to task on the manifesto commitment, the presidential candidate has repeatedly denied that Austria should form part of a greater Germany rather than remain an autonomous republic. Surprisingly, given how unpopular notions of pan-Germanism are in contemporary Austrian society, he has not always done so in unambiguous terms. \u201cFor me, Austria is a nation\u201d, he told Die Presse newspaper on Tuesday. \u201cBut I won\u2019t condemn anyone who sees it differently.\u201d Critics point out that Hofer\u2019s actions send a different message. He is an honorary member of the student fraternity Marko-Germania zu Pinkafeld, which in its 1994 founding document rejects the \u201chistory defying fiction of an \u2018Austrian nation\u2019\u201d.

Photograph: Hans Punz/AFP/Getty Images    In a speech in February 2015, Hofer called for South Tyrol in northern Italy \u2013 once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire \u2013 to be integrated into the Austrian state and has since proposed offering dual nationality to citizens of the autonomous province. Often, Hofer\u2019s flirtation with the iconography and language of the National Socialist movement has been far from covert. As late as 2013, he attended party gatherings wearing a blue cornflower on his lapel \u2013 a plant popularised as a symbol of the pan-German movement by the Austrian politician Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer, whom Hannah Arendt described as Adolf Hitler\u2019s \u201cspiritual father\u201d. Strache has stated that the cornflower represented \u201cthe bourgeois freedom movement of 1848\u201d, a claim that historians dismiss as fictitious. Hofer has said his favourite artist is the painter and sculptor Odin Wiesinger, whose works feature young men in fraternity uniforms and maps of the Greater German Reich. In a Facebook post from May 2015, Wiesinger claimed that \u201csince this so-called Germany was \u2018liberated\u2019 in 1945, it is \u2018anyone\u2019s\u2019 country and is being governed by puppets\u201d. In a separate entry, written in March 2016, Hofer wrote to Wiesinger: \u201cDear Odin! Don\u2019t be aggrieved. The polls are good and as a result the attacks are getting stronger. Be assured of my friendship.\u201d Asked in a TV interview whether he was an anti-fascist, Hofer rejected the term, saying he was against all forms of extremism. According to journalist Nina Horaczek, of Austrian weekly Falter, who has written a biography of Strache: \u201cHofer has broken with the anti-fascist consensus that has existed in Austria and Germany since the end of the second world war.\u201d During last Sunday\u2019s TV debate, Hofer bemoaned that leftwing activists had intimidated his party\u2019s politicians and defaced campaign posters. But the revival of the FP\u00d6 has also coincided with the rise of a new kind of rightwing activist movement which, although not officially affiliated with the party, shares many of its aims and beliefs.   Related: The Guardian view on European politics: Vienna calling | Editorial    Shortly before the first round of the presidential elections, a group of up to 30 members of the \u201cIdentitarian movement\u201d disrupted a Vienna performance of Nobel prize winner Elfriede Jelinek\u2019s play, Die Schutzbefohlenen, which deals with the refugee crisis, spraying fake blood and throwing out leaflets bearing the words \u201cmulticulturalism kills\u201d.  During the ensuing brawl with the audience, eight people were injured. A week later, activists scaled the roof of Vienna\u2019s Burgtheater during a performance of the same play, unfurling a banner reading \u201chypocrites\u201d. The pan-European movement, originally derived from France\u2019s far-right and anti-immigrant youth movement G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire, claims to reject the kind of violent methods employed by the neo-Nazi scene, instead staging \u201caesthetic interventions\u201d of the kind more familiar from leftwing or green movements. The movement has found a particularly fertile ground in Austria, where student Markus Willinger wrote its manifesto in 2013. Since 2014, the Identitarians have been monitored by Austria\u2019s office for the protection of the constitution because of its links to the neo-Nazi scene.

Vienna\u2019s Archive of Austrian Resistance research centre estimates that the organisation has no more than 60-70 active members and about 500 sympathisers. The group itself claims that its Austrian branch has 800 paying members and about 2,500 people who attend its events. During a meeting with the Guardian, one of its founding members, Patrick Lenart, claimed Austria\u2019s Identitarians were the \u201cmost active movement after that in France\u201d and that its membership had grown fourfold in the past year.   Related: The far right is weaselling into the mainstream, dressed up in suits | Paul Mason    Lenart, a 28-year-old philosophy student wearing a checked hipster shirt and Ray-Ban sunglasses, refused to say for whom he would vote on Sunday. But he said he could not think of any points in Hofer\u2019s manifesto that he disagreed with. Lenart praised the FP\u00d6\u2019s funding programmes for folklore customs in his native Carinthia, and said he believed the people of South Tyrol had to be given a chance to choose, in his words, \u201cwhether they are Italians or Germans\u201d. Strache has shared Identitarian videos on his Facebook page; in Vienna an Identitarian activist ran for office for the FP\u00d6. \u201cOur main aim is the preservation of our own cultural identity, that Austria remains Austrian and Europe remains Europe, and that is something the FP\u00d6 has in common with us,\u201d Lenart said. He added that it was a \u201cshame\u201d Hofer had said in the runup to the elections that he wanted nothing to do with the movement. At any rate, the Austrian new right\u2019s political sights are already set beyond an election victory for Hofer. Asked if liberalism was part of the European identity his movement wanted to preserve, Lenart replied: \u201cI think we all think very liberally these days, but I think it would be important to have an alternative to liberalism in our political landscape. Our current, tapered form of liberalism is a bigger problem than Islam, because it robs us of our own tradition and our own culture. \u201cThe world is melting into one. People are being de-rooted. The task of the Identitarian movement is to create the possibility so that people can once again become conscious of their place in an ancient chain.\u201d",
