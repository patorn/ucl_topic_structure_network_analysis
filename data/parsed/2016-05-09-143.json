  "body": "Robert Peston\u2019s new talk show opened with him muttering \u201cbreak a leg!\u201d to co-host Allegra Stratton, which was either unintentional or a radical teardown of the fourth wall on Sunday-morning ITV. The casual vibe continued as Peston appeared in an open-necked shirt, and admitted to being \u201cbleeding nervous\u201d. This was not the Andrew Marr show, where an hour earlier, Marr in a tie had interviewed Michael Gove in a tie and Prince Harry in, erm, a polo shirt. This is about British sartorial standards (and, as usual, Peston\u2019s hair). Peston, who has long been described as \u201cdishevelled\u201d, looked wilfully smart-casual to the extent that his first guest, George Osborne, had also jettisoned the tie. And they\u2019re not the only men in positions of power prone to flashing a bit of neck. Evan Davis, Barack Obama, BBC chief Tim Davie, Google\u2019s European boss, Matt Brittin, and obviously Jeremy Corbyn are all at it, too.     Completely relaxed \u2026 George Osborne. Photograph: ITV    \u201cI think he looks very well-groomed,\u201d says Dominic Sebag-Montefiore, creative director at legendary Knightsbridge tailor Edward Sexton. \u201cHis hair looks nice, he\u2019s got a smart pair of glasses, he looks respectable. Although I\u2019m a strong advocate of the shirt and tie, this is a Sunday-morning programme, not News at Ten.\u201d Peston has been relaxing his look ever since he left the BBC for ITV last November. A month before the move, he insisted that \u201cthe notion that what makes you a serious journalist is wearing a tie is bonkers\u201d. In February, he wore a flat cap and faux-fur collar for a news broadcast. After which the Tory MP Nicholas Soames publicly ordered him on Twitter to \u201cget a haircut put on a tie and generally smarten up\u201d. Peston, in the social media equivalent of whipping off one\u2019s tie in the House of Commons, told him to \u201ceff off\u201d. According to Edinburgh bespoke tailor Peter Johnston, Peston\u2019s look is bang on trend. \u201cSmart casual has come to the forefront in business dress in the last five years. When you get into warmer weather, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to wear an open-necked white or pale blue shirt.\u201d For Sebag-Montefiore, who tells me that \u201cboth Edward [Sexton] and I are in open-necked shirts, smart blazers and trousers today\u201d, it\u2019s all in the collars. \u201cIt\u2019s about wearing an open-necked shirt in a very deliberate way so the collar stands proud. And Peston\u2019s shirt collars are not flopping down because they need a tie to support them. It\u2019s a deliberate choice and he is not executing it badly.\u201d So there are areas for improvement? \u201cThere are things I would do differently,\u201d Sebag-Montefiore admits. \u201cI\u2019d like to see his jacket fit better.\u201d",
