  "body": "I guess someone was bound to say it. So, exhibiting a combination of traditional football rivalry, newspaper competitiveness and the columnist\u2019s penchant for contradictory polemic, Ashley Booker is that someone. He has written an article for the Derbyshire Times headlined \u201cLeicester City\u2019s Premier League success is not the greatest fairytale of all time\u201d in which he strives to put the team\u2019s achievement in context. It begins: \u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t join the nation - I mean bandwagon - in congratulating Leicester City...\u201d Booker, a Nottingham Forest fan, argues that claims about Leicester\u2019s feat by \u201cso-called experts, pundits and media men - mainly Sky Sports presenters\u201d are \u201cabsolute rubbish.\u201d He continues:  \u201cLeicester deserve all the plaudits they are getting, but their success has to be put into context of past glories. Manchester United winning the European Cup 10 years after the Munich disaster is arguably better; Bob Champion winning the 1981 Grand National on Aldaniti after overcoming cancer is too and, of course, what about my own miracle men, Forest, who went from second division also-rans to two-time European champions in just over 36 months? There\u2019s also the story of F1 driver Niki Lauda who suffered severe burns during the 1976 German grand prix and came close to death after inhaling toxic fumes. Six weeks later he was back racing and won the world championship the following season. All are great stories, as is Leicester\u2019s, but for those describing Jamie Vardy and his pals as the greatest ever - please do me a favour.\u201d  Booker, acting editor of Johnston Press\u2019s north Midlands newspaper group, is particularly exercised by Sky Sports.  He contends that the praise for Leicester City \u201cis yet another example of people subscribing to the view that football began in 1992 when Sky Sports started bankrolling the so-called \u2018beautiful game\u2019. \u201cEverything else in the sporting world pre-1992 appears to have been airbrushed from history.\u201d But Booker is prepared to change his mind... \u201cif the Foxes go on to win the Champions League next season (or the following season, like Forest).\u201d Then, he concludes, \u201cI may entertain the idea that Leicester City Football Club\u2019s achievements are the greatest ever. Until then, no...\u201d I wonder whether bookies will offer 5,000-1 odds on that happening. If so, will Booker wager \u00a31 on that possibility? Or would it break a Forest fan\u2019s heart to make money from the success of a team just 22 miles down the road? Anyway, I\u2019m sure there will be many who appreciate Booker\u2019s viewpoint (including former Forest players, Garry Birtles, writing in the Daily Telegraph, and Viv Anderson, interviewed by the Daily Mail). And there will be just as many who think him blinded by his loyalty to his club, now languishing in the bottom half of the Championship. But fans and ex-players aside, journalists will surely recognise Booker\u2019s column as a classic example of the sort of counter-intuitive controversy that is bound to attract readers.
