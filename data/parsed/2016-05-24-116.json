  "body": "YEP, YOU GUESSED We go again. Another day, another tedious bulletin outlining the goings-on at Manchester United, where Louis van Gaal has left the building and paid for his trip by private jet to the Algarve, where he famously and rather childishly provoked giggles by deliberately buying a property that was very near and just a little bit bigger than the one owned by his neighbour, compatriot and enemy Ronald Koeman. Yep, The Fiver knows full well football can be a spiteful and petty business and in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho it seems United are about to appoint the most spiteful and petty of them all. A box-office appointment that is already generating endless headlines before it\u2019s been rubber-stamped, it will do no end of good for the club\u2019s far-reaching and all-important global brand, keeping their name in the news while simultaneously spreading happiness among their coterie of sponsors. Just look at the goofy grin on the moustachioed chops of Mr Potato \u2013 the official Malaysian snack partner of Manchester United looks genuinely thrilled!   Related: Manchester United\u2019s Ed Woodward meets Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s agent in London    Of course before Mourinho can be unveiled as Manchester United\u2019s new boss, he must negotiate the finer points of a contract that will ensure he receives millions of pounds for doing nothing when the time inevitably comes for him to be unceremoniously booted through the door marked \u201cDo One!\u201d. With this in mind, Manchester United blazer Ed Woodward is currently in talks with Mourinho\u2019s Mr 15% Jorge Mendes, a man so successful at his job that he reportedly secured his client \u00a34m from the club for quite literally doing nothing apart from hanging around until a certain Dutchman was shown the door. With Van Gaal gone, the future of Ryan Giggs at Manchester United remains unclear, although it has been noted that the Welshman\u2019s name was conspicuously absent from the list of club employees thanked by the Iron Tulip in the statement he released on his departure. An oversight or something more sinister? Come now, he deliberately bought a summer house that was very near and just a little bit bigger than Koeman\u2019s, which suggests there might well be devilry in this glaring lack of detail. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI give a small house, it\u2019s not a castle. But it\u2019s in a great part of Marseille, with around 200 square metres of garden. We renovated it, we had it painted. We bought all the furniture, all the plates. I didn\u2019t take a picture with them and put it on Facebook or Twitter\u201d \u2013 Eric Cantona, in an exclusive chin-wag with Owen Gibson, talks about his donation to refugees, as well as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Pep Guardiola, Manchester United and why he\u2019ll be supporting England, not France, at Euro 2016.     \u2018I don\u2019t care at all about France. In terms of football, I am an Englishman. I have in my veins the English blue blood.\u2019 Photograph: Sebastian Nevols    GONE FOR A BARTON 6 June 2012: \u201cI\u2019m a Celtic fan \u2026\u201d \u2013 Joey Barton discusses his Scottish allegiances. 24 May 2016: \u201cI am so grateful and so happy to finally be a [Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019] Rangers player. I am incredibly humbled by the way [fans] have reached out to me and I feel I already owe them a lot of things. I can\u2019t wait to get out there and show what I am about\u201d \u2013 Joey pitches up at Ibrox. FOOTBALL WEEKLY LIVE AC Jimbo and co are heading back to Manchester, on Friday September 2. Get your tickets while they\u2019re mildly toasty NOW! FIVER LETTERS \u201cFor someone whose time is clearly so precious to them (Jeremy Adams, Friday\u2019s Fiver letters) might I suggest that 15 seconds to load a web page would indicate a terribly poor or possibly faulty internet connection. I\u2019d moved on from the whole \u2018URL not found\u2019 and got back to the usual disappointment of the rest of The Fiver in less than five seconds. Perhaps collectively we could troubleshoot this for him? I\u2019ll kick off by suggesting that he should try turning his router off and on again\u201d \u2013 Matt Keen. \u201cThe Economist, 7 May, had a boring buzzkill (natch) column under the heading Fairy Tales, titled Underdogs are Overrated, comparing Big Cup outfit Leicester City to Lance Armstrong, Donald Trump and North Korea. Two weeks later, the letters to the editor included six replies to the column, including from a Cern physicist and one \u2018Sir Tony Brenton, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire\u2019. Maybe Jack Stokes (yesterday\u2019s letters) and I can run some relationary models between the 1056, and the six Economist pendants. I wonder if Sir Tony has ever had a letter published in The Fiver? Does he have a desk nearby?\u201d \u2013 Jef Diesel. \u201cNow, I genuflect at the altar of the Special One as much as the next man (assuming that man happens to be a certain Catalan with the ability to speak German), but the problem is that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho doesn\u2019t understand the traditions of Manchester United, doing things the right way, with respect for everyone. Apropos of nothing, this\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cIf Noble Francis married Mark Noble, would Noble Francis become Noble Noble? And would that stop him getting in the letters section EVERY DAY!!??\u201d \u2013 Gary Walsh. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Gary Walsh. JOIN GUARDIAN SOULMATES Chances are that if you\u2019re reading this tea-timely football email, you\u2019re almost certainly single.

And don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s not the rejection that kills you, it\u2019s the hope. BITS AND BOBS Tory ambassador and bird-shooting banter-fan Sol Campbell is ready to take time to fix England\u2019s defence. \u201cIf they want someone to come in and help the young defenders I would absolutely do it, I\u2019d do it all day long,\u201d he roared. \u201cI\u2019ve just passed all my coaching badges.\u201d     He\u2019s, etc. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Guardian    Lille have signed striker Eder on a four-year-deal after being impressed by his 13 goalless appearances for Swansea. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior,\u201d parped coach Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Antonetti. Massive knack-scare plus tantrum turns into minor thigh-niggle inside an hour.  New Queen\u2019s Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers says he wants Joey Barton to be loud and proud next season: \u201cThese fans are phenomenal. It\u2019s my job to deliver the football that inspires and excites the supporters. It\u2019s about scoring goals and winning.\u201d Middlesbrough are poised to make Viktor Fischer their first signing of the summer after agreeing to give Ajax \u00a33.8m for the decent Dane. Liverpool are set to sign 22-year-old goalkeeper Loris Karius for \u00a34.7m from Mainz, but Mario G\u00f6tze doesn\u2019t fancy joining him.  Uefa is taking the lead on clean football ethics again: fining Liverpool \u20ac40,000 \u2013 half suspended \u2013 for their fans\u2019 \u201cManchester is full of sh1t\u201d chant during March\u2019s Big Vase clash. References to the disasters at Hillsborough, Heysel and Munich were heard over both legs of the last-16 tie, but failed to make Belgian delegate Jean Paul Mievis\u2019s report. United have been fined the same amount by Uefa for less specific \u201cillicit chants\u201d, plus another \u20ac18,000 for fans blocking stairways and throwing objects. Oh, and Liverpool will pay another \u20ac17,000 for fans setting off fireworks, throwing objects and for the late kick-off. And third person\u2019s Steve Evans says Steve Evans is \u201cready, better than ever physically and mentally to deliver promotion for [Nasty] Leeds. I\u2019ll be back to work on Wednesday.\u201d Which will be awkward, what with Massimo Cellino making eyes at Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke. STILL WANT MORE?
