  "body": "The Giro d\u2019Italia\u2019s fluffy wolf mascot will be banned from appearing when the race enters France next week after protests from a farmers\u2019 group who complained his presence would be \u201cpure provocation\u201d. Lupo Wolfie, who became the Giro\u2019s mascot last year, was due to accompany the race when it enters the Hautes-Alpes department in south-eastern France for stages 19 and 20 next week.

His predecessor was Ghiro, a giant rat who has been described as a wobbly-eyed cross between Don Corleone and Master Splinter.",
