Here are the 10 best ways to discover the rich landscape and culture of West Sweden.    Related: Eat like a Swede    Sample signature seafoodWest Sweden is famous for its seafood. But the experience does not have to start at the dinner table. The closeness of Sweden\u2019s island archipelago allows visitors to take part in the fishing themselves. Fishing tours and seafood safaris take place all summer and autumn in the seaside resort of Sm\u00f6gen, where lobster and crayfish are abundant \u2013 especially in August and September when crayfish parties take place in homes throughout the country. You can head out on shellfish safaris all over the western province of Bohusl\u00e4n, hunting for oyster, crayfish, lobster, mussels and shrimp. If there\u2019s no home for you to head to don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t have to miss out on a crayfish party. Norrqvarn Hotell & Konferens offers some catch-your-own fun fresh from the G\u00f6ta canal, while guests at the V\u00e4der\u00f6arnas V\u00e4rdhus guesthouse have the chance to tuck into freshly caught langoustines (ocean crayfish) from its enviable location on the Weather Islands. Kayak in Bohusl\u00e4nIf you visit Bohusl\u00e4n, make sure to experience it paddling a kayak through the crystal clear waters surrounding this beautiful archipelago, with plenty of beaches to rest at. Nautopp Seakayaking offers a three-day tour starting from the seaside resort of Grebbestad (home of some of the world\u2019s best oysters). When you reach the Fj\u00e4llbacka archipelago you relax swimming, snorkelling and sunbathing. Make sure you look out for seals when you pass the island of Hamburgsund. At night you sleep in tents on sandy beaches.      Head to Sm\u00f6gen for seafood safaris.

Fika is the obligatory time of day \u2013 sometimes even law-enforced at the workplace \u2013 when Swedes meet over coffee and something sweet to eat. Alings\u00e5s is called the capital of fika, due to its rich heritage in this tradition. As early as the 18th century coffee shops filled the town and, luckily, many remain. Visitors are invited to partake in the tradition in a newly created fika tour. The hour-and-a-half long walk, hosted year round, takes visitors to five selected stops set among the tempting bakeries and coffee shops of Alings\u00e5s. This way you get to experience the Swedish lifestyle up-close \u2013 Swedes love to sit down with a cup of strong coffee and a bun and talk for hours.  \u201cCinnamon buns, seven types of traditional cookies, and princess cake (prinsesst\u00e5rta), a layered cake with whipped cream, vanilla and jam filling covered in a layer of green marzipan, is served alongside modern raw-food fika [raw, unprocessed, health-concious ingredients such as nuts and dried fruits],\u201d explains Gunbritt Reteike, Alings\u00e5s council\u2019s head of tourism. Travel along G\u00f6ta canalConstructed in the early 19th century, G\u00f6ta canal connects a number of lakes and rivers to form a route from Sj\u00f6torp by Lake V\u00e4nern, north-east of Mariestad, to Mem on the Baltic Sea, just east of S\u00f6derk\u00f6ping, stretching 191 kilometres. There are plenty of tours you can take here, including cycling, hiking and going on one of the canal boats. You can also catch fresh crayfish from the canal. Norrqvarn Hotel & Conference offers a three-day cycling tour where you get to pass historic sites and visit old harbour warehouses. Visit the G\u00f6ta canal site for more information.

Surrounded by a large garden and steeped in medieval history, the castle also offers more modern facilities, including dining at restaurant Hvita Hjorten and coffee at Caf\u00e9 Stallet. There is also lodging for visitors \u2013 either in the nearby camping grounds and guest harbour, or in Victoriahuset on the banks of V\u00e4nern. The castle is open May to September.

The cosy fishing village is also the setting for popular crime novelist Camilla L\u00e4ckberg\u2019s Fj\u00e4llbacka Murders series. The city even hosts murder mystery tours in L\u00e4ckbergs\u2019 name.   Go seal watching in KosterKosterhavet, Sweden\u2019s first national marine park, protects a coral reef and aquatic life in and around the Koster fjord, host to the greatest amount of marine biodiversity in Sweden.

Other activities in the area include snorkelling, and fishing for mackerel and crayfish.
