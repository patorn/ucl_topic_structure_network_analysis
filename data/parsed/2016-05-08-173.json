  "body": "This experimental work from British artist and film-maker Ben Rivers belongs at the most arcane reaches of the arthouse spectrum. Created as part of an installation, it\u2019s a piece which would sit just as comfortably in a gallery as it does in a cinema. Rivers blends documentary and fiction \u2013 the first 40 minutes is an account of film-maker Oliver Laxe shooting a feature in the High Atlas mountains in Morocco, before Laxe becomes the protagonist of Rivers\u2019s own hallucinatory narrative. There is a savage beauty to this work, which is very loosely based on a short story by Paul Bowles, but it is a demanding, difficult viewing experience.         Watch the trailer for The Sky Trembles and the Earth Is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers.",
