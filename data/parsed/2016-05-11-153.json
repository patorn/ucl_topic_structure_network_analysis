  "body": "With a day to go before the publication of the government\u2019s white paper on the BBC \u2013 which may or may not turn it into a state broadcaster akin to Russia or North Korea \u2013 it seems as good a point as any to look back to the last time this happened in 2006.  The then Labour government took a little longer to publish its thoughts on the future of the white paper. Here are some of the main proposals put forward by the then culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, who said the BBC should \u201ccontinue to take fun seriously\u201d. Strictly entertainment   Related: The BBC\u2019s uncertain future | Letters    \u201cWe do not subscribe to the idea that public service broadcasting should be confined to the \u2018worthy\u2019. Indeed, in most cases the BBC\u2019s output will achieve its maximum impact only by entertaining its viewers and listeners,\u201d the white paper opined in 2006, though a version of the next sentence could even be found in Thursday\u2019s text. \u201cOn the other hand, the BBC should not chase ratings through derivative or copycat programming. For the BBC, being entertaining should be of fundamental importance, but it should involve competing with other broadcasters on grounds of quality, not by simply copying or adapting successful formats.\u201d What sort of entertainment programmes the BBC should be making, and where they should be scheduled, has been a key focus of attention in the run-up to Whittingdale\u2019s white paper. Strictly Come Dancing, namechecked in the 2006 white paper, is still the BBC\u2019s biggest entertainment hit. Expect it to be referenced again, along with The Great British Bake Off and, in less glowing terms, The Voice. Pick any one of five \u201cWe confirm a set of five characteristics that will distinguish the BBC\u2019s content: high quality; challenging; original; innovative; and engaging. All BBC content should display at least one of the characteristics.\u201d To which critics might reply: Tumble?  Trust in me The BBC governors were replaced with a new BBC Trust and executive board 10 years ago. \u201cThere have been concerns that the trust will be too close to the executive. But that would be against the long term interests of the BBC,\u201d it said. And that is exactly what happened, the trust encumbered by its dual role of both \u201cregulator\u201d and \u201cchampion\u201d, and criticised in crises from excessive pay to the Savile scandal.  The governors, which the trust replaced, lasted 80 years. The trust, which will be abolished in the new charter, managed just 10. Flog it! On the BBC\u2019s commercial activities, the white paper said they should be run \u201caccording to four principles: fit with the BBC\u2019s public purposes; commercial efficiency; BBC brand protection and avoiding market distortion. The BBC Trust will be responsible for holding the executive to account for complying with the criteria\u201d. A year later in 2007, BBC Worldwide controversially acquired the Lonely Planet travel guides business, selling it six years later at a loss of nearly \u00a380m. Show me the money \u201cThe television licence fee remains the best way to fund the BBC and will remain its main funding mechanism throughout the next 10 years. We will review the scope for alternative funding mechanisms around the end of digital switchover [2012].\u201d Amid warnings of tough times in store for Channel 4, it added: \u201cWe will consider forms of assistance such as asking the BBC to provide Channel 4 with financial help\u201d as well as the distribution of licence fee money more widely beyond the BBC. Digital switchover aside (see below) top-slicing did not become a reality for the BBC until the 2010 funding settlement with the new coalition government, taking on responsibility for the World Service and broadband rollout, among other things. Channel 4\u2019s financial apocalypse never happened. Now it faces a different challenge. Let\u2019s get digital \u201cThe BBC is best placed among all broadcasters to act as a \u2018trusted guided\u2019 for the public through this process.\u201d  The rollout of digital TV was an unmitigated success \u2013 as this poor soul, who watched the first analogue signal go out, can testify. There was even money to spare. Its entire reason for being \u201cWe confirm six new public purposes for the BBC: sustaining citizenship and civil society; promoting education and learning; stimulating creativity and cultural excellence \u2013 including film; reflecting the UK\u2019s nations, regions and communities; bringing the world to the UK and the UK to the world and building Digital Britain.\u201d Hard to argue against. But even harder to measure, you might think. The future \u201cBroadcasting in 2016 will bear little relation to today\u2019s media world.\u201d         They\u2019re going to remake House of Cards? With Kevin Spacey? Net what?    It got that right.",
