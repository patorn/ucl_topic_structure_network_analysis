  "body": "Gary Lineker has called culture secretary John Whittingdale a \u201cchump\u201d for making a joke that abolishing the BBC is a \u201ctempting prospect\u201d.  Whittingdale, who is due to publish the government\u2019s white paper on the future of the BBC next week, made the comments in a speech at Cambridge University\u2019s Conservative Association last Friday. Lineker, the former England footballer and BBC Match of the Day host, tweeted that the culture secretary was a \u201cchump\u201d to make such comments about the corporation.

We should be proud of it, not destroy it.  https://t.co/WvNmDUKOMD\u2014 Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) May 4, 2016    Later, Lineker hit back at a Sun editorial claiming his criticism of Whittingdale showed he was becoming a \u201csniping left-wing bore\u201d. He described the Sun attack as a \u201ccareer high\u201d, adding:     In @TheSun I've been accused of having morals, fighting for social justice and being alright at my job.

The @guardian reading lefty stereotyping has always been my pigeon hole, move on.\u2014 Graeme Le Saux (@graemelesaux14) May 5, 2016    Whittingdale jokingly said of the BBC\u2019s charter, which runs out at the end of 2017, \u201cif we don\u2019t renew it, it may be that the BBC will cease to exist, which is maybe occasionally a tempting prospect\u201d.  The culture secretary also indicated his commitment to hand part of the licence fee to outside organisations to make programming such as children\u2019s TV, arts coverage and local news.  \u201cThere is a case for having some plurality, so that the decision as to what programmes are commissioned isn\u2019t exclusively taken by the small group of commissioning editors at the BBC,\u201d he said, in comments first reported by Cambridge University\u2019s student newspaper Varsity on Monday.  Last week Tony Hall, the director general of the BBC, sought reassurances from the chancellor, George Osborne, that so-called \u201ctop-slicing\u201d would not take place, having considered the prospect ruled out under the funding agreement struck with the Treasury last year. The pro-Brexit minister added that the corporation \u201cfinds it difficult to take seriously people who have a different view of the world\u201d and \u201chas always regarded people who want to leave Europe as faintly mad [and] it has generally been in favour of spending public money rather than those who want to see lower taxes\u201d.",
