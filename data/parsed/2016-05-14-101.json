  "body": "Rooftoppers is an extraordinary book. It might make you laugh and fascinate you. Every time I read it I can\u2019t put it down. A young orphan called Sophie can\u2019t find her mother and is adopted by a man called Charles and gets an interview but it doesn\u2019t go very well. She moves to France with Charles to hunt for her mother. I won\u2019t tell you the rest because I don\u2019t want to spoil it for you. I would rate it for readers aged 10+ on your own but 8-9 with your parents. I would give it 10 out of 10. I hope you read the book and if so enjoy it.
