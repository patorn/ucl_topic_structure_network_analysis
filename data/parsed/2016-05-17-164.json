  "body": "Has Test cricket become \u2018London-centric\u2019? It\u2019s a short walk uphill from King\u2019s Cross to the corner of Barnsbury Road and Tolpuddle Street, on the west edge of Angel in north London. There was a cricket ground here once, White Conduit Fields, named for the stoneworks that carried water from the local spring. The ground is long gone now, buried deep among the many layers of old London that lie beneath the new streets. But there are little clues, for those looking. A nearby cul-de-sac still carries the name, a restaurant occupies the old pub that once shared it, too, and across the road by the gravel football pitch in Barnard Park there\u2019s a small plaque with a precis of the spot\u2019s place in history. Because White Conduit, wrote the historian AD Taylor, was \u201cthe acorn that blossomed into the gigantic oak\u201d. That oak still grows. It is five miles further west in St John\u2019s Wood, 30 minutes away through the Camden backstreets on the 274 bus: Lord\u2019s. Thomas Lord, the man who gave it the name, worked at the White Conduit Club as a net bowler and, as Plum Warner put it, \u201ca sort of general attendant\u201d. Lord\u2019s father had land but it was sequestered after the Jacobite uprising and for a time Lord fetched up working as a labourer on the very farm he used to own. His son, Thomas, travelled to London, thinking he would set himself up in the wine tradebut found a better opportunity when the Earl of Winchilsea and the future Duke of Richmond offered to back him in building a new private ground across the city.   Related: Jonny Bairstow: \u2018Adversity has made us stronger. We\u2019re a special family\u2019    First Lord set up in Dorset Square, close by Marylebone. White Conduit moved with him, and soon merged with the newly formed Marylebone Cricket Club. The rents at Dorset Square grew too high and Lord relocated to the North Bank of the St John\u2019s Wood estate. Then Parliament decreed that the new Regent\u2019s Canal would run through the venue. So Lord finally arrived at the current site. Lord\u2019s name fitted the ground just fine. It was White Conduit\u2019s rule that \u201cnone but gentleman ever to play\u201d and while the new MCC was a little more relaxed, it has always retained an aristocratic air, one which, to be honest, now seems out of keeping with the city around it, and the game as it is played around the country. Lord\u2019s, wrote Jim Kilburn, \u201cthe place where you take your hat off as you go in\u201d. Kilburn, who spent more than 40 years working as the cricket correspondent for the Yorkshire Post, loved it there. \u201cLord\u2019s does command respect,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo sit at Lord\u2019s is to share in substance and so become a man of substance yourself.\u201d Kilburn was not alone in feeling that. And the waiting list to join the MCC is still 27 years long. But the very same qualities Kilburn admired in the old ground rub others the wrong way. John Arlott described it as \u201ca place for authoritarians\u201d. And while Kilburn reckoned that \u201cfew other places so happily mingle formality and comfort\u201d, it often seems to me that the one precludes the other. In London, I\u2019d sooner go to The Oval, an admission that will likely escape censure on the grounds that, as a rule, MCC members don\u2019t tend to be Guardian readers. And the one man I did meet who was a member of both constituencies explained that on a busy day a copy of the paper draped over the neighbouring chair was an excellent way to secure himself a little more elbow room because it made so many other members reluctant to sit next to him. Lord\u2019s has too many airs and graces for my taste, too many spectators who have come to be seen rather than to watch. The MCC had its AGM recently. The president, Roger Knight, gave a speech in which he described Test cricket as a \u201cLondon-centric\u201d game, a statement that seems bound to be received well around the rest of the country and, most especially, you imagine, in Yorkshire and Lancashire. Knight\u2019s numbers stack up. He pointed out that in the past three years, more than 340,000 spectators have come to Lord\u2019s to watch the first Test of the summer. At the same time, the three following Tests, all held at Headingley, have drawn only 110,000, or \u201c32% of the figure for Lord\u2019s\u201d, as Knight put it. \u201cAnd in 2012, when there were three Tests against West Indies, the crowd here was higher than the other two grounds added together.\u201d Which is why, Knight suggested, Lord\u2019s should continue to stage two Test matches a summer. \u201cIt is by no means certain that from 2020 onwards there will be sufficient Test matches to enable MCC to be awarded two per summer,\u201d Knight said, \u201csimply because there may not be sufficient Test matches to distribute among the grounds that would expect to stage them.\u201d He argues that \u201cTest cricket is thriving in London, the time has come to pay attention to that fact\u201d. This time also being the moment in which Lord\u2019s faces losing its second Test. With another match at The Oval, three of each summer\u2019s seven matches are held in London and the seven remaining Test venues, many struggling for money, are competing with each other for four fixtures.  In this argument, it seems that what matters most to the MCC isn\u2019t the health of Test cricket around the rest of the country but whether or not its members still get to enjoy their 10 days of Test cricket each summer. Warner once described the MCC as \u201ca private club with a public function\u201d. Knight\u2019s words reveal on which side the balance lies. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.
