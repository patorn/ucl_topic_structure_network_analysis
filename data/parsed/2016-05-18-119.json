However, there are ways to boost how you feel about yourself, including sharing your problems with others and doing activities that make you happy. You can also fake it if you\u2019re not yet there.  You could be a first-year student whose confidence has been knocked after receiving negative feedback, or a final-year student needing a confidence boost in your skills and career choices.  Our panel of carefully selected experts will be on hand to answer your questions and offer tips and advice. Our Q&A will cover:   Tips to boost your confidence. Building resilience. Having confidence in your decisions. Working out what you\u2019re good at. Advice on ways to fake confidence.  The Q&A will take place in the comments section below this article.
