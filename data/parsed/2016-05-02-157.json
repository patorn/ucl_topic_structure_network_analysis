  "body": "China has suspended an outspoken property magnate from the Communist party after he publicly questioned President Xi Jinping\u2019s attempts to bring the country\u2019s media to heel.  In February, just days after Xi demanded absolute loyalty from China\u2019s party-controlled press, Ren Zhiqiang challenged the move on social media.  \u201cWhen did the people\u2019s government change into the party\u2019s government?\u201d Ren, a sharp-tongued tycoon who some call China\u2019s Donald Trump, wrote to his tens of millions of online followers.  The internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China, responded by closing the 65-year-old\u2019s social media accounts and accusing him of spreading illegal information.  A government spokesperson said Ren\u2019s comments were a \u201cvile influence\u201d. State media announced Ren\u2019s long-awaited punishment on Monday in a brief dispatch. China Radio International said he had \u201cviolated the political discipline of the party\u201d and had been suspended from the party for a year. \u201cRen\u2019s remarks on online platforms and during public occasions have run counter to the party\u2019s basic policies on multiple occasions,\u201d the state-controlled news group added.      Xi Jinping. Photograph: Iori Sagisawa/AP    Ren\u2019s suspension \u2013 a punishment less severe than some had anticipated \u2013 has come amid severe political tightening in China.  Last week China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament gave the green light to a controversial law placing foreign non-governmental organisations operating in China under the control of the security services. Critics say the law is designed to force NGOs seen by Beijing as potential threats out of the country. In February, Xi toured three state media organisations as part of what one expert called a \u201cno-holds barred\u201d attempt to seize control of the news agenda.  Xi told Chinese journalists they should \u201clove the party, protect the party, and closely align themselves with the party leadership in thought, politics and action\u201d.  The intensifying clampdown has brought signs of resistance. In March Chinese security officials launched a manhunt apparently intended to track down the author of an anonymous online letter that had called for Xi\u2019s resignation.  Kerry Brown, the author of a new book about Xi called CEO, China, said he saw the crackdown as part of a decade-long Communist party struggle to stamp out those questioning its rule, such as civil rights lawyers and dissidents.  \u201cIt is part of a war. Xi Jinping has been tougher at fighting that war largely because the party has become, I think, more spooked by the effectiveness of some of its opponents,\u201d he said.  Brown said he believed the entire party leadership backed the current offensive. \u201cI think the party leadership at the top may disagree on many things that we don\u2019t know about. But I\u2019m pretty sure they agree on one thing and that is that without the party, they and the whole mission of [helping] China to become this great nation for the first time in modern history will go out of the window.  \u201cI think they really, profoundly believe that. They think the party is the thing that is going to get them there and they must defend it.\u201d",
