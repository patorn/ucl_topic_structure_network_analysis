  "body": "There\u2019s always been more than a touch of Jane Austen about the films of Whit Stillman, the incisive social satirist behind 1998\u2019s The Last Days of Disco and 2011\u2019s Damsels in Distress. Stillman\u2019s 1990 debut feature Metropolitan drew inspiration from Mansfield Park, and his subsequent studies of social manners have all possessed an arch observational tone that one imagines Austen might have appreciated. In 2003, he was reported to be working on a project called Winchester Races, which would marry material from the unfinished Austen novels The Watsons and Sanditon. Here, he draws on the title and plot respectively of two early epistolary works; Love and Freindship (Stillman duly standardises the young Austen\u2019s spelling) and Lady Susan. The subtitle of the former was Deceived in Freindship and\u00a0Betrayed in Love, a delightfully ironic phrase that resonates somewhat with the narrative of the latter, a tale with which Stillman takes some delicious modern liberties as he brings the slightly inaccessible source material to the big screen with crowd-pleasing panache.    Stillman brings the slightly inaccessible source material to the big screen with crowd-pleasing panache    \u201cI am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like,\u201d Austen said of Emma, and that dictum could perhaps be applied to this terrifically brittle account of a middle-aged woman who brilliantly manipulates those around her through a mixture of intelligence, elegance, and fox-like cunning. Kate Beckinsale is superb as Lady Susan Vernon, the widowed mother whom we first meet leaving the Manwarings\u2019 Langford estate amid rumours of impropriety, to\u00a0the bracingly chosen strains of Purcell. Lady Susan is en route via London to Churchill (\u201cHeavens, what a bore!\u201d), the Surrey country house of her late husband\u2019s brother, Charles (Justin Edwards), where she plans to stay with her companion Mrs Cross (Kelly Campbell), an \u201cimpoverished friend\u201d and unpaid skivvy who, \u201conce rested, craves activity\u201d.         Watch the trailer for Love & Friendship    Satirical title cards introduce us to a plethora of key players including Morfydd Clark\u2019s Frederica Vernon, Susan\u2019s \u201celigible daughter\u201d; Tom Bennett\u2019s Sir James Martin, \u201cher unintended\u201d and \u201ca bit of a rattle\u201d; and Xavier Samuel\u2019s dashing Reginald DeCourcy, Charles\u2019s handsome brother-in-law and the new focus of Lady Susan\u2019s schemes. \u201cYour renown precedes you,\u201d Reginald cattily tells the coquettish Lady Susan upon her arrival, only to be handsomely slapped down with a skill and precision that will soon make him the lovesick slave of the target of his jibes. For some, such as Emma Greenwell\u2019s Catherine Vernon, Lady Susan is \u201ca genius\u2026 diabolically so\u201d, whose machinations must be halted at all costs. For the audience, she is a devilish delight, a femme fatale who believes \u201cfacts are horrid things\u201d and whose electrifying company we cannot help but crave.    She is a devilish delight, a femme fatale whose electrifying company we cannot help but crave    Brilliantly described by the BBFC as\u00a0containing \u201cno material likely to harm or offend\u201d, this acerbic U-certificate gem must be the most politely impolite film of the year. Intelligently adapting the monologues of Austen\u2019s source material into dramatic dialogue (a scene between Reginald and his father, for example, conversationally intertwines Letters 12 and 14 of the novella), Stillman\u2019s screenplay draws spicy cream from the milk of the author\u2019s formal experiments.     Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale in Love & Friendship, who also co-starred in Whit Stillman\u2019s Last Days of Disco.    Performance adds another layer to the cake; as the splendidly stupid Sir James, Bennett pulls off one of the great comic coups of the year, creating a character of whom Richard Curtis would have been proud. One part Austen to two parts Blackadder, Sir James is the not-too-distant cousin of Hugh Laurie\u2019s gormless George, whether delightedly chasing peas around his plate (\u201chow jolly... tiny green balls!\u201d) or wondering which two of God\u2019s 12 commandments he is now allowed to break. Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, who co-starred with Beckinsale in The Last Days of Disco (and features in Stillman\u2019s Amazon pilot The Cosmopolitans), makes light work of Lady Susan\u2019s American-exile friend and confidante, Alicia Johnson, with Stephen Fry lending cameo support as Alicia\u2019s drearily \u201crespectable\u201d husband whose next bout of gout is eagerly awaited. But this is Beckinsale\u2019s show, and just as Lady Susan commands the attention of all those around her, so she draws our eyes and ears at all times with a performance of poise and precision. Most important is just how much fun Stillman seems to be having with what is only his fifth feature in 26 years. Eimer N\u00ed Mhaoldomhnaigh\u2019s eye-catching costumes and cinematographer Richard Van Oosterhout\u2019s well-chosen Irish locations lend visual heft, but it\u2019s the sound of the wicked laughter that Love & Friendship provokes that I will remember longest. What a treat. Well played, Mr Stillman!",
