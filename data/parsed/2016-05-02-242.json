  "body": "What was the last piece of music you bought? The new album by And\u00e9 Somby, Yoiking With the Winged Ones. He\u2019s appearing at Tectonics in Glasgow and Oslo this year.            What\u2019s your musical guilty pleasure? Sometimes I like listening to disco, or New Wave stuff such as Roxy Music. But I listen to so much music I don\u2019t really feel that anything is a guilty pleasure. How do you listen to music most often? CDs in the car, vinyl records at home, and on my headphones when travelling. But family life means I don\u2019t listen as much at home any more.    Applause between movements has always been part of the response between the audience and the musicians    What was the first record or CD you bought? When I was 13 and I lived in Munich there was a great CD store off Marianneplatz, and they\u2019d let you listen to anything. I first heard Tristan and Wozzeck there, which my parents then bought for me. The first thing I bought with my own money though was Bach Sonatas & Partitas for solo violin. Is applauding between movements acceptable? Sure. It happens more and more but I don\u2019t find it a problem. Mozart used to write to his father telling him about the applause he\u2019d get in the middle of a symphony. It\u2019s always been part of the response between the audience and the musicians. Mobile phones are more of a problem for me than an audience voicing its excitement. What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert? I\u2019m kind of traditional, but one thing that I do hate is when there\u2019s too much light on the audience and they want to read the programme notes. If people want to read about the music they can do it before the concert, after it, or at the break, but they should be listening during the performance. I like it quite dark in the hall, like a theatre. What\u2019s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member? I remember going to seeing Christa Ludwig doing Winterreise in New York. I was 13 and didn\u2019t know the piece well - it was the first time I\u2019d heard it all the way through. It was at Carnegie Hall with James Levine at the piano. It was just amazing.            We\u2019re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why? The premiere of Monteverdi\u2019s Orfeo. The initial beginning of opera is so far from us, it\u2019s so unknown. There are so few documents about it, no pictures, nothing. To be there and discover what it was like would be incredible. If you found yourself with six months free to learn a new instrument, what would you choose? Percussion. Perhaps Indian drumming. Do you enjoy musicals? Do you have a favourite?            No, it\u2019s so loud with the PA and I don\u2019t like those amplified voices. I\u2019m more into Kurt Weill, which is where musicals came from; those witty, powerful texts, and that distilled music which is both simple and complex. I\u2019m doing the Seven Deadly Sins later in the year with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Which conductor or performer of yester-year do you most wish you could have worked with? Artur Schnabel. For me his Beethoven Piano Sonatas are just unequalled, they\u2019re really vibrant and free. He\u2019s using tempo in an interesting way, there\u2019s lots of rubato and this strong feeling of structure. Doing a Beethoven or Brahms piano concerto with him would have been incredible.         Schnabel plays Beethoven.     What, in your opinion, is the most overrated classical piece? I used to avoid doing Shostakovich Five as I thought it was overrated \u2013 and then I did it and just loved it! It\u2019s not the same, but in a funny way I think Mahler is being played too much. I love his work but it\u2019s over-programmed. Which non-classical musician would you love to work with? Diamanda Gallas or Brian Wilson. Imagine you\u2019re a festival director here in London with unlimited resources. What would you programme - or commission - for your opening event? I\u2019m kind of doing that with the Tectonics festivals around the world \u2013 but not with unlimited resources! I\u2019d love to do a new large-scale opera or a vocal piece that blends lots of genres, such as folk music, improvised and electronic music, and which uses a brand new text. Something that would also use multi-media, professional and non-professional artists so that it\u2019s community based as well. And to be staged somewhere that makes an innovative use of space. It\u2019s late, you\u2019ve had a few beers, you\u2019re in a Karaoke bar. What do you choose to sing? Probably some Israeli songs from the 80s. Something like Svika Pick.            Tectonics festival, curated by Ilan Volkov, is at City Halls, Glasgow on 7 and 8 May.",
