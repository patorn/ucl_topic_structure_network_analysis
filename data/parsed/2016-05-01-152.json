  "body": "Where I grew up, in Aldgate, east London, one of the poorest boroughs in the country, I saw lots that was real \u2013 the bankers with their briefcases, the man next door with five wives, the illegal immigrants in Flat 5. I\u2019m from a world you rarely see on screen, and I want to show it off. So many of my memories revolve around TV. After watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I went to my sister\u2019s room crying hysterically. Eventually I got the words out: \u201cBuffy\u2019s dead!\u201d It was the first real loss I experienced. And I didn\u2019t have the words to describe it. To be able to do that to someone through your writing, that\u2019s the dream. The first TV to inspire me to write was Kathy Burke\u2019s remarkable Walking and Talking. More recently, Tituss Burgess in Tina Fey\u2019s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt [a big black flamboyant wannabe Broadway star] inspired the character in the second series of my TV show Chewing Gum. The things they were brave enough to do with his character allowed me to be brave enough to do what I wanted with mine. It was like I was waiting for permission. When they see the filthy things I\u2019ve written, people think I\u2019m fearless, that I have no filter, but if they knew the scope of inappropriate things that go on in my head they\u2019d thank me for how much I don\u2019t say.

You couldn\u2019t bring up phlegm.\u201d We\u2019d all watch EastEnders, but it was only me who\u2019d act it out. My sister would hear me talking to myself in the bathroom mirror in a Scottish accent. Except I\u2019d never met a Scottish person. I didn\u2019t know I was acting, but I was \u2013 I was running through my own made-up BBC dramas. Like most people my age, today I watch all of my TV online. Perhaps it\u2019s because we lack commitment. We don\u2019t want to be told when something\u2019s on \u2013 I\u2019ll watch when I want to watch. But that means I lose something I loved \u2013 that excitement of saying at school: \u201cDid you watch Big Brother last night?\u201d TV is the glue. Now we daren\u2019t talk about it, in case of spoilers. As a kid I\u2019d watch a cable channel called Trouble, comedies like Moesha and Kenan and Kel. It was the only place to see black people on TV. If there was something on, it was always comedy, always American. Because we lived in Aldgate, which wasn\u2019t a black area, these shows became what we thought a black world looked like. My generation of black British people often feels part American because of what we learned from TV. If we crack jokes, we can find ourselves doing it in an African-American accent.

You have black shows with black people, and white shows with white people \u2013 in the real world, most of us are racially integrated. We need to start showing that. The problem is something to do with the way America likes to see Britain. Americans want to see Downton Abbey. So British TV babyfeeds them what they want. We make things palatable and one-dimensional. But this is Britain \u2013 we are a mesh of cultures. I want to see that on our screens. TV has a social responsibility. It doesn\u2019t only reflect society; society also reflects TV. We have a moral obligation to hold a mirror to the people watching the shows. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do: I\u2019m not pushing \u201cblack\u201d, I\u2019m pushing unity among men and women of all colours. So much of what we see on TV lacks diversity, and that\u2019s to do with privilege. Privilege distances you from reality. Chewing Gum is a sitcom set on an estate in east London. Its central character is a girl from a Pentecostal background who decides to embark on a more worldly lifestyle \u2013 it\u2019s about adolescence 10 years too late. In my dreams everybody is watching it, finding out about my world and realising it\u2019s not what they imagined. That it\u2019s not terrifying. That the people here are hilarious, people you might want to make friends with, people like you. The House of Fraser British Academy Television Awards will be shown on Sunday 8 May, 8pm, BBC One Michaela Coel is nominated for Female Performance in a Comedy and has won the Bafta Craft award for Breakthrough Talent. Chewing Gum is nominated for Best Scripted Comedy",
