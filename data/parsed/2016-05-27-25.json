  "body": "One of the best things to do in the moneyed microstate of Monaco is to visit the medieval village of Monaco\u2011Ville, which overlooks Monte\u00a0Carlo, the port and the shimmering cobalt blue of the Mediterranean. Here can be found the Prince\u2019s Palace, focal point of the principality\u2019s comic-opera royal family. At 11.55 every morning there is a changing of the guard, something about which the Monaco Grand Prix, to be run here on Sunday, seems to know very little.   Related: Monaco GP: Hamilton faster than Rosberg in accident-ridden FP1    This street circuit, with its very individual demands, has a habit of producing serial winners. Graham Hill, then Alain Prost, followed by Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher, seized\u00a0control of its tight corners and narrow passages beside the harbour and\u00a0were most reluctant to relinquish their hegemony. Now Nico Rosberg preens like the Prince of Monaco after three successive victories at a track where the challenges were memorably described by Nelson Piquet as \u201clike trying to cycle round your living room\u201d but added that \u201ca win here was worth two anywhere else\u201d. Lewis Hamilton appeared destined for his own lengthy reign when he triumphed in his second world championship season in 2008 following on from victories here in GP2 and F3. At the time Sir Jackie Stewart predicted there would be many more wins for Hamilton here \u2013 but the victory eight years ago represents his solitary success. He badly needs to score over his Monaco neighbour to cut into the German\u2019s 43-point championship lead. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of reasons and excuses and things that have got in the way,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cI remember in 2009 I crashed. I probably had the car to get pole and I crashed, so I didn\u2019t win that race. My mistake. Then others I didn\u2019t have the performance to be on pole, and pole is everything here.\u201d In fact, overtaking is so difficult at Monaco that the procession of cars often resembles some multicoloured train \u2013 although at least this one will run in an area that has been crippled by yet another rail strike. It is his most recent failures that have most disappointed Hamilton because he has had both the car as well as the talent to win. \u201cI wasn\u2019t comfortable with the braking in 2013,\u201d he says about a race in which he qualified second and finished fourth, dropping a couple of places after the introduction of the safety car. \u201cYou know about 2014,\u201d he says, with a roll of the eyes and a rueful grin. Two years ago Rosberg compromised Hamilton\u2019s chances of winning pole when he made a mistake at Mirabeau and reversed back on to the track. The introduction of the yellow flags ruined Hamilton\u2019s flying lap. While the majority opinion in the paddock \u2013 including Hamilton\u2019s \u2013 was that Rosberg\u2019s action was deliberate, the German was cleared by stewards. Last year, infamously, Hamilton was let down by Mercedes. He totally dominated the weekend, winning pole and then opened up a 24-second lead on Rosberg. In an extremely poor miscalculation, however, Mercedes thought they could bring in Hamilton for fresh rubber and return him to the track still leading the race. They got their sums wrong. The driver\u2019s anguished cries must still haunt the team\u2019s collective memory. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened guys? Guys, what\u2019s happened?\u201d he pleaded over the team radio. \u201cI\u2019ve lost this race, haven\u2019t I?\u201d So did Mercedes owe him one? \u201cNo. I arrive here and I don\u2019t feel like I am owed anything. They helped me win the world championship [twice]. I have zero frustration about this race,\u201d he adds, almost convincingly. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful that I get to race here. I\u00a0won in Formula\u00a03, GP2 and F1. If I didn\u2019t win here again that\u2019s just how it is. As long as I won championships in that time. One weighs a lot more than the other. I won the world championship in 2014. A and last year I won the world championship.\u201d Hamilton, however, has not won a race since October. He was still in a bullish, confident mood as he looked forward to this weekend\u2019s round. \u201cI don\u2019t have any doubt about myself. Never have. Why would I? I\u2019ve been racing 23 years. Nico and I have known each other since we were 13. He is bloody fast and keeps me on my toes. If I had a team\u2011mate that finished fifth we couldn\u2019t get the constructors\u2019 championship. You should go and find out over the 23 years who has been the most successful in all the championships, the thousands of races we\u2019ve done. People just know F1.\u201d Hamilton has detected a hardening of Rosberg\u2019s resolve, though. He can no longer be pushed around by his innately faster team-mate, as he was in Austin in October, when the British driver secured his third world title.           F1 Monaco GP: all you need to know about the Monte Carlo circuit    \u201cFrom Brazil onwards he changed his approach a little bit,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cI remember I tried going round the outside and he blocked me. I thought: \u2018Good on you, I would have done exactly the same.\u2019 I think from there he\u2019s definitely worked harder for position. That\u2019s how it should be. He kept questioning scenarios on the track and for clarification [from Mercedes] on what moves are allowed, and what are not.\u201d Rosberg\u2019s run of seven successive wins was ended by Max Verstappen\u2019s victory in Barcelona this month, in his debut race for Red Bull. The Mercedes team watched in horror as Hamilton and Rosberg took each other out of the contest after only three corners. \u201cWe will try our best to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cBut, ultimately, we are hired to go racing and shit happens. I just do my talking on the track. My dad taught me that when I was eight. I am trying to do my talking on the track. I don\u2019t feel like I have to do it off the track because I am good enough on the track.\u201d In Monaco Hamilton has not always spoken very eloquently on the track \u2013 but here he spoke well off it.",
