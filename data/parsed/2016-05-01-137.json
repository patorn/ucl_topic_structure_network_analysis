  "body": "The Culpeper is the gift that keeps on giving: on its ground floor, a pub; a restaurant on the first; skyline views from its reopening-for-the-summer rooftop terrace; and now, on the second floor, five en suite bedrooms at \u00a3120 a night B&B. It is an endeavour where succeeding at every level could be tricky, but team Culpeper manages it all with panache. It is late afternoon when I check in and the bar is already full, causing drinkers \u2013 a mix of London\u2019s young and zestful, City workers and craft-ale fans \u2013 to mill around the doors of the pub at the corner of Commercial Street and Wentworth Street. The atmosphere is genial-busy, even the sun is making an appearance, but the hubbub makes me wonder if the only way I\u2019ll be able to avoid getting annoyed by drinkers\u2019 late-night conversations is by joining them.     The Culpeper plans to serve breakfast in its rooftop greenhouse. Photograph: Dominic Dorrin    Two floors up and inside Room Two, looking on to Commercial Street, I realise Monsieur Grump can take the night off. It is quiet but, more than that, it is quite lovely. The distressed aesthetic of the light-blue- and-sandstone walls is softened by Scandi elements such as a slatted wooden light shade, wooden clothes rail, a beautifully patterned throw from Mandal Veveri and striking prints by Rebecca Salvadori. It offers cosiness, character and, as I\u2019ll find later, the sleep-inducing comfort of a quality Hypnos bed, too. Other accoutrements include a Nespresso tea-and-coffee maker, wire-frame chair and reading matter, such as a map of the area designed by Herb Lester. However, just like the bijou bathroom (powerful shower, no bath), these elements suggest the Culpeper\u2019s rooms aren\u2019t designed for long-term lounging. And I can\u2019t argue with that when east London\u2019s adult playground is just a few minutes away. Brick Lane, the Old Truman Brewery, and Petticoat Lane and Spitalfields markets can all be reached before you\u2019ve switched on Google Maps.      But, while the Culpeper may not want you hiding in your bedroom, it is more than happy to have you at its bar and restaurant, where hotel guests receive a 10% discount during their stay. Though tithed to Enterprise Inns, it offers a good choice of bottled and draught beers, the latter from Purity Brewing including the smooth Mad Goose, the fruity LongHorn IPA and the citrusy Pure Gold. I enjoy a pint of this last ale before meeting my dining companion and climbing the stairs to the restaurant. The evolution of the Culpeper \u2013 which is named after 17th-century herbalist Nicholas Culpeper \u2013 has been a phased one. When Jay Rayner raved about the food in July 2014 it was before the restaurant ascended to the first floor: that happened last year. Two years on and the food remains as successful and satisfying: inventive yet fuss-free modern British that is designed to comfort without resorting to crockery-bending quantity.     The pub, on the ground floor. Photograph: Dominic Dorrin    My starter of crispy lamb breast, baby artichokes and salsa verde (\u00a36.50) is potent meaty terrain but with a textural counterpoint provided by vegetables, while my friend enjoys the delicate taste of asparagus, house-cured bacon and poached duck egg (\u00a38). The three mains on offer cover meat, fish and vegetarian options: we step either side of the red mullet (\u00a316) and pick gnocchi, shitake mushrooms, wild garlic, parmesan and pine nuts (\u00a312) and pork chop, baby garlic, broad beans, anchovy and herb crunch (\u00a316). Though the flavours are different, the result is the same: sweet and savoury in the right measure, punch where required, and satisfaction guaranteed. And so to bed \u2026 or rather up an extra flight of stairs to the rooftop, where many of the restaurant\u2019s vegetables and herbs are grown. This area is still being worked on but, ultimately, it will be a rooftop space where guests will take breakfast (I can tell you the fry-up rates highly, too).     The Culpeper\u2019s rooftop garden. Photograph: Dominic Dorrin    I stand and look at the night skyline, the Gherkin seeming so close, and picture this space busy with a grill pumping out food and a bar serving its cans of Purity\u2019s Lawless. I\u2019m sure it will be entertaining but, for a few seconds, it\u2019s wonderful to experience London in a moment of calm, with only a few street sounds filtering up to the heights. While it has several floors, the Culpeper doesn\u2019t have too many flaws. It certainly deserves its reputation for quality and \u2013 in a city where so many rooms are expensive but lack character \u2013 value for money.\u2022 Accommodation was provided by The Culpeper, 40 Commercial Street E1, doubles \u00a3120 B&B, 020-7247 5371, theculpeper.com Ask a local The Gentle Author, writer and blogger at spitalfieldslife.com     Libreria bookshop in Spitalfields.
