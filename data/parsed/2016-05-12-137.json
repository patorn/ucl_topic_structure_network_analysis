  "body": "Roberto Mart\u00ednez has been sacked by Everton after three seasons in charge. The club\u2019s new major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, decided to end Mart\u00ednez\u2019s tenure following talks with the Goodison Park hierarchy on Thursday and has begun the search for a successor.   Related: Frank de Boer to leave Ajax after agent says Dutchman would love Everton job    Moshiri opted to spare Mart\u00ednez the indignity of angry protests at the final home game of the season against relegated Norwich City. The club also postponed the club\u2019s end-of-season awards dinner on Thursday in the wake of the sacking after fans planned to protest against the board\u2019s running of the club. David Unsworth, Everton\u2019s Under-21s coach, is expected to take charge of Sunday\u2019s Premier League fixture. \u201cEverton Football Club regrets to announce that Roberto Mart\u00ednez has left his position as first-team manager with immediate effect,\u201d the club said in a statement. \u201cThe chairman and the board of directors would like to place on record their thanks for the dedication and commitment Roberto has shown during his three seasons with the club. \u201cRoberto has been a great ambassador for the club, conducting himself, at all times, with the utmost integrity and dignity. He secured the club its highest ever Premier League points total, a place in the last 16 of the Europa League and appearances in both domestic cup semi-finals. \u201cHe has also played a key role in the development of several young players, managing their progression to the Everton first team and international honours.\u201d Confirmation of Mart\u00ednez\u2019s exit followed the resolution of talks between Everton and the Spaniard\u2019s representatives over a severance payment. The 42-year-old had three years remaining on the lucrative contract he was given by Everton at the end of his first season in charge in 2014.     Everton\u2019s fans make their feelings known.

Moshiri acted following a dire run of form, a second poor Premier League season and clear evidence of support draining for Mart\u00ednez from the fanbase, players and the boardroom, although the chairman Bill Kenwright was loth to part company with the former Wigan Athletic manager. Everton have won only one of their last 10 matches and their latest anaemic away performance, Wednesday\u2019s 3-0 reverse at relegation-threatened Sunderland, came with the manager demanding a reaction to a feeble 3-1 loss at Leicester City on Saturday. Mart\u00ednez and his players were on a scheduled day off from the club\u2019s Finch Farm training ground on Thursday.       Supporters, who have turned against Mart\u00ednez in increasing numbers in recent weeks, were to protest outside the awards dinner at St George\u2019s Hall in Liverpool and there would have been further calls for Mart\u00ednez\u2019s departure at Goodison on Sunday had the owners delayed the decision until the end of the campaign. Frank de Boer\u2019s agent, Guido Albers, said at the weekend that his client \u201cwould love to join a club like Everton\u201d. His departure from Ajax was announced by the Dutch club on Thursday after De Boer\u2019s team blew the chance to win the championship on the final day of the season. Moshiri, the British-Iranian billionaire who acquired a 49.9% stake in Everton in February, has promised new investment this summer but his first major call at the club will be a new managerial appointment. Everton are 12th in the Premier League and lost both domestic cup semi-finals this season. Last season\u2019s 11th-place finish was the club\u2019s lowest in nine years and Mart\u00ednez\u2019s record over the past two Premier League campaigns stands at 22 wins from 75 matches.
