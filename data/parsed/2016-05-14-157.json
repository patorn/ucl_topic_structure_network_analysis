In a small Danish fishing village of Agger, the film finds 16-year-old Marie on the cusp of adulthood, having all but outgrown the home she shares with her stoic father and mysteriously catatonic mother. After finding a job at a fish-processing facility and a boyfriend who looks like Ronan Keating, Marie seems to have amassed all the key hallmarks of adulthood, and that\u2019s to say nothing of the thick coat of hair growing all over her body. Though its Nordic origins and sombre tone have seen When Animals Dream lazily compared to Let The Right One In, the film\u2019s cerebral take on werewolf lore has more in common with a long line of North American horror movies in which lycanthropy stands in for the biological and social hurdles of adolescence. From 80s camp classic Teen Wolf to po-mo millennial romp Ginger Snaps, such films have made a case for the horror genre as a medium uniquely well suited to the capturing the emotional whirlwind that is pubescence.             Throughout When Animals Dream, Marie\u2019s supernatural transformation is presented as just one of many teenage traumas. At work, her colleagues inflict a barrage of physical and verbal abuse under the guise of banter, while at home her father is controlling to the point of suffocation. Upon observing Marie\u2019s changing physicality, he attempts to medicate her emergent animalism with drugs that will render her as comatose as her mother. He sees a woman unrestrained and his first impulse is to restrain her, in line with the Victorian doctors who pathologised unruly women as \u201chysterical\u201d, or the contemporary fathers who police their daughters\u2019 sex lives with the proverbial 8 Simple Rules.  But if When Animals Dream gets the horror of puberty right, it\u2019s blind to the comedy that comes with it. Lead actor Sonia Suhl maintains a look of cold indifference throughout the proceedings \u2013 lest the film dip even fleetingly below the austerity threshold of contemporary Danish cinema \u2013 and sometimes looks not so much angsty as anaesthetised. As viewers will no doubt be anticipating, Marie\u2019s reticence eventually gives way to third-act carnivory as she allows the wolf within to take control. By this point, though, her loss of humanity is underwhelming; she displayed so little of the stuff in the first place.",
