  "body": "I wonder if the Windsors watched The Windsors (Channel 4). You would, wouldn\u2019t you, if someone made a satirical comedy about your family? I can imagine them (the real Windsors) all sitting down together in the TV room ... \u201cBut they\u2019ve turned me into a deluded old fool!\u201d splutters Charles. \u201cI rather liked Henry Anfield, until this.\u201d \u201cTurned you into a deluded old fool?\u201d says Camilla, taking a large glug of her gin and tonic. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a Gypsy!\u201d says Kate, crossly. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve got anything against them.\u201d \u201cNo, of course you\u2019re not, and of course you don\u2019t,\u201d says Prince William, patting her hand. \u201cI thought you said this was a comedy,\u201d says Prince Harry. \u201cBut it\u2019s a documentary isn\u2019t it? God, Pippa does have a fantastic arse, doesn\u2019t she? How did they know about me shouting \u2018incoming\u2019 when I come? Oh, because it\u2019s a documentary I suppose \u2026\u201d OK, so the show\u2019s not saying anything new. But it is saying it with a new joy: this is caricature to the max. To the cli-max (\u201cincoming!\u201d), in Harry\u2019s case. He\u2019s not just a bit thick, he\u2019s actually illegi \u2026 sorry, illiterate. Kate and Pippa aren\u2019t just commoners, they drink Diamond White cider and fight rottweilers in a Morrisons car park. Camilla\u2019s not just a bitter outsider, she\u2019s pretty much Lady Macbeth, plotting the downfall of everyone around her (a brilliant idea \u2013 tricking Kate into going to Harry\u2019s ball for amputee soldiers dressed as Long John Silver). Oh, and she\u2019s pregnant \u2013 Camilla, not Kate. Charles must have somehow fumbled his way into the right hole, though an Italian fertility doctor also played his part.  Hilarious performances all over the place, including from Harry Enfield, who does a lovely deluded old fool. Give that man a knighthood. Actually, my favourite characters are Fergie\u2019s girls, Beatrice and Eugenie (played by Ellie White and Celeste Dring), a couple of useless Sloanes searching for purpose on the fringes of the family. Until they get radicalised, that is. Glorious. The whole thing actually made me feel quite patriotic.",
