  "body": "Daniel Ricciardo set a Monaco lap record to claim his first pole for Sunday\u2019s grand prix. It was Red Bull\u2019s first pole since the Brazilian Grand Prix of 2013, and their first here since 2012. But there was more frustration for Lewis Hamilton, who had problems with his car and was beaten back into third place by his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Meanwhile, Red Bull\u2019s other driver, the great F1 prodigy Max Verstappen, returned to earth with a bump when he crashed out in the first stint of qualifying. Formula One is just too unpredictable. Red Bull\u2019s principal, Christian Horner, described Ricciardo\u2019s Q3 lap as \u201cdynamite\u201d and added: \u201cIt was an amazing performance. A 1min 13.6sec. Mighty. He\u2019s been driving beautifully all weekend. You\u2019ve only got to look at the last sector, how clean he has been driving, and the lap times just rolled together for him.\u201d While most drivers concentrated on using Pirelli\u2019s new ultrasoft tyres, Ricciardo used the slower supersoft in Q2, which means the Australian will start race using that rubber. Horner said: \u201cWe felt the supersoft has a bit more range. We thought if we can get on that tyre, it certainly gives you more strategic options. So I\u2019m surprised no one else opted for it. We gave it a go and it paid off.\u201d Ricciardo\u2019s normal grid-wide smile appeared broader than ever as he revelled in the Monaco pole. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a special place,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew coming into the weekend we would have a shot at it. It looked good from Thursday. I also had it in my mind after Barcelona that I have been driving well but haven\u2019t quite got maximum rewards. So I came into this weekend with a lot of confidence and a lot of belief I could be in this position. I have always enjoyed this place. We have a good package behind us and it\u2019s nice to be able to make the most of out it.\u201d There could not have been a greater contrast between his countenance and that of Hamilton, who must wonder when his ill fortune will change. The Mercedes driver was favourite for pole at the start of Q3 but then hit problems with his fuel pump and his car came to a standstill. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with the engine,\u201d he gasped over the radio. \u201cI\u2019ve got no power.\u201d The defending world champion\u2019s car was frantically wheeled back to the garage by a team of mechanics but by the time Hamilton re-emerged there were only seven minutes of qualifying remaining. After two aborted efforts he was able to put in just one flying lap before the end. Hamilton had remained positive this season, despite the poor starts and the car woes that have plagued his campaign. He has not won a race since Austin last season. But now he was a study in utter dejection. \u201cIt was a difficult qualifying,\u201d he said with marked understatement. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to say at the moment but the good thing is I did get out to do a lap at least. It was as bad as some of the races have been in respect of the engine problems so I\u2019m grateful to be up in third. Pole was there for the taking but I will do what I can in the race to salvage what I can from today\u2019s result.\u201d When asked about Hamilton\u2019s negative body language the Mercedes principal, Toto Wolff, said: \u201cLewis wears his heart on his sleeve and when he\u2019s a bad day you can see that and it\u2019s fair enough. It\u2019s his character. We want him to be authentic. But he bounced back very well after Barcelona.\u201d Wolff sounded as if he had had enough of the technical glitches that have marred another otherwise successful start to the season. \u201cWe are pushing the limits on the car and all the systems, and on the engine, and when you push yourself you reach the limits. But we need to sort it out. It\u2019s starting to get frustrating. It\u2019s extremely painful not to be on pole.\u201d It was also a painful afternoon for Master Verstappen, the precocious star of Barcelona two weeks ago when the 18-year-old become the youngest driver by more than two years to win a grand prix. Qualifying had barely started before he was out of it and he will start the race from the back of the grid. The young Dutchman broke his right front suspension when he clipped the barrier coming out of the Swimming Pool complex, careering across the track to crash into the wall. \u201cI was already down to earth, but these things happen, especially in Monaco,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you count the crashes [at Monaco] over the last few years, there have been quite a few, and unfortunately it happens to me in qualifying after a win in Barcelona. It was very unexpected from my side. Of course, it is not ideal, but I also try to stay out of the barrier and I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d Verstappen believes his crash cost him a chance of a top-four grid slot. \u201cYou don\u2019t want that to happen, especially in Q1 when you have a car that is comfortably top four. It is not what you want. It was pretty simple. I turned in slightly too early, touched the inside barrier and broke the track rods. I couldn\u2019t steer any more so I went straight into the barrier.\u201d On another disappointing day for Ferrari, Sebastian Vettel qualified fourth and Kimi Raikkonen sixth. Vettel said Ferrari should have \u201cdone a better job\u201d and that his car \u201cjust got worse. Unlike everyone else we didn\u2019t get any quicker.\u201d",
