  "body": "It\u2019s a case of similar titles, different subject matter, with Girl Up by Laura Bates (the Everyday Sexism project), and Man Up, by Rebecca Asher (Shattered: Modern Motherhood And The Illusion of Equality). The former is primarily aimed at the youth-feminism market; the latter, while not unsympathetic to feminism, asks: \u201cWe live in a man\u2019s world, so why do so many boys and men fail to flourish?\u201d Indeed, ironically, the titles flag up the differences: while Girl Up is a play on \u201cman up\u201d, Asher might argue that the very phrase \u201cman up\u201d is a judgment on perceived male weakness and thus part of the problem. In the case of Girl Up (\u201cPart manifesto, part girl guide\u201d), while it is youth-oriented, Bates doesn\u2019t deliver a sanitised \u201csugar-and-spice\u201d tutorial. In the preface, actor Emma Watson observes that the book is \u201cnot for the faint-hearted\u201d, and she ain\u2019t kidding! Alternative titles included Spunk for Girls and Bend Clit Like Beckham, the inside covers feature dancing cartoon vaginas (complete with top hats and canes), and, as seems de rigueur with new-style feminist tomes, there\u2019s some impressive swearing. Bates knows her market \u2013 no self-respecting teenager would want to be caught dead reading something that fails to produce at least a prickle of parental dread. I experienced a couple of pearl-clutching moments myself (one section appears to take masturbating with root vegetables for granted \u2013 is Bates quite sure about this?). However, as Bates, a Cambridge graduate, is doubtless aware, it\u2019s one thing to master earthy no-frills teen-vernacular; quite another feat to get an enduring message across.   Related: Laura Bates interview: 'Two years ago, I didn't know what feminism meant'    In the main, Girl Up proves effective at communicating a central idea that is at once very simple and incredibly complicated: far from being weak, fluffy creatures, young women are strong and powerful. \u201cSuperheroes!\u201d declares Bates, going on to detail the forces aligned against them. Everything from societal judgments, double standards, social media pitfalls and street harassment to sexual objectification, pornography, partner abuse, food disorders and body shaming \u2013 citing and interviewing female role models along the way (from Mary Beard and Martha Lane Fox, to Shami Chakrabarti and Bridget Christie). Some of Bates\u2019s positions may prove too hardline for some readers \u2013 such as the matter of sexual consent. Obviously, rape is always rape (not \u201cdate rape\u201d, or any other term that softens or undermines it), but in my opinion it\u2019s possible to have real concerns about grey areas of consent without being in any way a rape apologist. However, Girl Up\u2019s brio more than propels it along. In particular, I enjoyed Bates\u2019s invention of the \u201csexist bullshit klaxon\u201d (in a just world, you\u2019d be able to buy one on Amazon), her defiant rebuttal of the \u201cmean girls\u201d stereotype, the before and after shots of herself posed in a bikini (to demonstrate how Photoshop works), and her robust response to the much droned about phenomenon of \u201cfriend-zoning\u201d: \u201cGirls don\u2019t owe guys sex just for being nice. Seriously, fuck off.\u201d Quite.    Asher is vivid on the perils of teenage gangs\u2026 and does a great job of delving behind male suicide statistics    In Man Up: Boys, Men and Breaking the Male Rules, Asher flags up how boys and men are also stereotyped from a young age (\u201cWhy does society hold this shallow and colourless image of men?\u201d), and how this leads to disturbing statistics. Males are four times more likely to have behavioural difficulties, three times more likely to be excluded from school, and make up 75% of suicides and 95% of the prison population. \u201cMen are still restricted by the straitjacket of the male stereotype,\u201d writes Asher, who has a son and daughter. \u201cThere is growing recognition that the state of masculinity needs reassessment.\u201d There were times when I wasn\u2019t wholly persuaded by Asher\u2019s arguments (I think, despite everything, most men would still choose the \u201cmale breadwinner\u201d pressure over the generic female crapshoot), but Man Up makes for interesting reading. It encompasses the various stages of male existence, from early conditioning (\u201cWe can show boys that they have so many more options than the dominant male stereotype suggests\u201d), through school, young adulthood, fatherhood, and \u201csocial isolation\u201d in later years. Asher is especially vivid on the perils of teenage gangs, ably utilising such interviewees as MP David Lammy and musician and actor Ashley Walters. Asher also does a great job of delving behind male suicide statistics (the primary cause of death for men aged 20-45). With its scholarly, painstakingly thorough approach (Everyday Sexism gets a mention), you do wonder how many boys and young men will end up reading Man Up, but it could be a valuable book for parents, or anybody who works closely with children or teenagers. At the same time, Asher stresses that to care about men is not to undermine feminism: \u201cIt is precisely the interrelated nature of our existence and fortunes as men and women that motivates my analysis of the male world.\u201d I was left feeling that the books were similar after all, if only in one key way. While Girl Up uses a variety of accessible tools (jokes, lists, illustrations) to explain feminism to young girls, Man Up employs meticulous research to examine how boys and men are faring today. Ultimately, for all their differences, both books strive to illuminate \u2013 shining torches out into the modern world. Girl Up is published by Simon & Schuster (\u00a312.99).
