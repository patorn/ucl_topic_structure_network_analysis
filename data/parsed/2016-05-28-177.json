  "body": "Stephen on Zo\u00eb What were you hoping for? For someone to warm me up. First impressions? Lovely eyes, trendy and looked as nervous as I was. What did you talk about?The horror of renting in London, the pubs of Hackney, her resident spider, our paper rounds as kids, Mad Men. Any awkward moments? I nicked the last bit of chicken while she went to powder her nose. Good table manners? Top marks. Best thing about Zo\u00eb? She was pleasant company. Would you introduce her to your friends? If the chance arose I would. She\u2019s a highly likable lass. Describe Zo\u00eb in three words Fashionable, intelligent and vivacious. What do you think she made of you? I think the age difference might have put her off. Did you go on somewhere? It was getting on and she said she was tired. And... did you kiss? Not on the lips I\u2019m afraid. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? A quieter restaurant would have been better. Marks out of 10?A solid 8. Would you meet again? I think we both know that probably won\u2019t happen. Zo\u00eb on Stephen What were you hoping for?A fun evening getting to know someone new. First impressions?Not my usual type. What did you talk about?Fashion, mackerel, how he can\u2019t stand the trash TV I like, but we both enjoy wildlife documentaries. Any awkward moments?He went to get drinks and was at the bar for half an hour. Good table manners?Yes. Best thing about Stephen?He is just so lovely and kind. Would you introduce him to your friends? I think they would scare him. Describe Stephen in three wordsKind, friendly and interesting. What do you think he made of you? Probably obsessed with cats. Did you go on somewhere?We stayed on for a couple of drinks.   Related: Blind date: \u2018He looked disappointed\u2019    And... did you kiss?Just a peck on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?That I had worn warmer clothes because I was too cold to take my jacket off. Marks out of 10?8. Great conversation.
