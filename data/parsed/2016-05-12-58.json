  "body": "This week we want to hear your songs on the theme of power. Interpret and extrapolate how you will \u2013 be it the lyrics, the music or song\u2019s title and whether you see brute force or political influence \u2013 and post your nomination in the comments.   Related: Readers recommend playlist: songs about sinners    You can find a list of all songs previously picked and so ineligible for the series here. You have until 11pm on Monday 16 May to post your nomination and make your justification. A regular RR contributor (this week, George Boyland) will then select a playlist from your recommendations. If you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions \u2013 and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian \u2013 please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line \u2018RR guru\u2019 or make yourself known in the comments. Here\u2019s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:  Tell us why it\u2019s a worthy contender. Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song\u2019s words. Provide a link to the song. We prefer YouTube, but Spotify or Soundcloud are fine. Listen to others people\u2019s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist. If you have a good theme, or if you\u2019d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com. There\u2019s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \u201czedded\u201d, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of \u201czedded\u201d (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), \u201cdonds\u201d and other strange words used by RR regulars. Many RR regulars also congregate at the \u2019Spill blog.    Related: Were you a punk? Share your pictures and stories    We\u2019d like to learn a bit more about you and what you love. Each week, alongside RR, we\u2019ll be asking you to tell us more about the songs you\u2019ve nominated through our GuardianWitness page. We want to hear the stories, see the photos \u2013 of gigs, of moments, of your record sleeves \u2013 that you associate with the songs you have nominated. You can also share your theme ideas.",
