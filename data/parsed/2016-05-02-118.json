The club\u2019s sporting director Txiki Begiristain was pictured in Bilbao last month, with Basque newspaper EITB reporting that City have told Athletic officials that they are willing to meet his release clause. \u201cIt is a specific request of Pep Guardiola,\u201d read the report. Laporte, who moved to Athletic as a 16-year-old, has signed four contract extensions since December 2013 as his status as one of the world\u2019s best young defenders has grown.",
