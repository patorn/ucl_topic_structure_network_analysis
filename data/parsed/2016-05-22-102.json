  "body": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is set to be appointed the new Manchester United manager in the next few days after agreeing a deal to take over from Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman won the FA Cup with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday and seemed to be under the impression that he would still be in charge next season, but is now certain to be replaced by Mourinho.   Related: Manchester United win FA Cup as Jesse Lingard sinks Crystal Palace    The Portuguese manager, who left Chelsea under a cloud in December last year, turned down an offer from Paris Saint-Germain in the hope that United would come calling \u2013 and negotiations took place in the last few days after United had missed out on fourth place in the Premier League and therefore a Champions League berth. Mourinho has already agreed a salary and has discussed possible transfer targets with the club and is likely to be presented as United\u2019s new manager once his agent, Jorge Mendes, has finalised the finer details of the contract. Van Gaal leaves United after two seasons in charge. United finished fourth in the league in his first campaign and won the FA Cup on Saturday but went out in the group stage of the Champions League and were then eliminated by Liverpool in the Europa League. United\u2019s plan had always been to keep Van Gaal in the job for three years before handing over to someone younger, such as Ryan Giggs. But the lack of progress on the pitch and the fact that many of the club\u2019s new signings failed to improve the team meant that the club decided to end the deal with one year remaining. However it seemed Van Gaal was unaware of the news as rumours started to swirl round Wembley last night and his final press conference turned into something of a farce. The FA Cup-winning manager turned up to speak at Wembley with the trophy in his hands, and placed it on the table in front of him. \u201cI show you the Cup, I don\u2019t discuss my future with the media,\u201d he said defiantly. \u201cSome of you have had me sacked already.\u201d Reports were still emerging at that point that the club had drawn a line under Van Gaal\u2019s reign, with William Hill shortening their odds on United for the title next year on learning of Mourinho\u2019s appointment, but the Dutchman was having none if it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cI am proud that I am the first United manager after Sir Alex Ferguson to win a trophy. I have had a picture taken with Sir Alex, because that is history.\u201d Even before Saturday night\u2019s developments it was common knowledge that United would not be satisfied with just an FA Cup win. Champions League qualification has always been their main aim and Van Gaal could only manage a fifth-place finish. Yet when asked if he had plans for next season Van Gaal replied in the affirmative. \u201cThe aim will be the same, we need to improve further and we need to sign new players,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much we improve is dependable on the players we can buy. I have said on several occasions I would like a fast winger. I believe in refreshment of my squad, you cannot always use the same players.\u201d So confrontational was Van Gaal\u2019s mood it was difficult to remember a Cup final had just taken place and he was the winning manager. \u201cWe showed we can still fight to the end, and I am very proud as a Manchester United manager,\u201d he said of the game. \u201cWe had spirit, even after injuries and going down to 10 men [after Chris Smalling\u2019s red card], and it was a beautiful goal from Jesse Lingard that decided the match.\u201d He then went on the attack again, complaining about media coverage of his decision to leave Memphis Depay out of his Cup final squad. \u201cI had to make a hard decision, and it is true that Memphis did not travel to Wembley with the team,\u2019 he said. \u201cHe just came down on a later train, that\u2019s all. We did not all travel together because I want focus in my squad.\u201d   Related: Louis van Gaal was doomed at Manchester United by refusal to adapt | Amy Lawrence    Alan Pardew was a disappointed runner-up, as might be expected, though at least he did not have to face questions about not being in the same job next season. \u201cWith a bit more help with the referee we might have done better,\u201d the Crystal Palace manager said. \u201cI thought it was a penalty when Rooney brought down Wilf [Zaha], but I was most disappointed with the Connor decision [not to play advantage when Wickham recovered from a foul to put the ball in the net]. You could see he was going to get up first and the advantage was still with us. \u201cWhen we took the lead so late in the game I thought we might see it through but Rooney came up with a great moment to put them back in it. Not many other players could have done that, and the winning goal was a wonder hit. It was a great final, it could have gone either way, but in the end it didn\u2019t go ours.\u201d",
