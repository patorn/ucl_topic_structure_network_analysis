  "body": "Labor\u2019s ability to fund its multi-billion dollar election promises has been thrown into doubt by treasury officials, on the evening before the Turnbull government delivers its first budget. Labor last year announced plans to raise $47.7bn over 10 years by increasing the tobacco excise dramatically, and using that money to pay for $70bn worth of spending plans. It says if elected it would increase the tobacco excise by 12.5% a year, between now and 2020, plus twice-yearly indexation, and that that would raise $3.8bn over four years, and $47.7bn over the decade.

Under current policy, a pack of 25 cigarettes costs about $24.69 today and will cost $29.91 in 2020. Under Labor\u2019s proposed policy, it would cost $40.80 in 2020. But organisations like the Grattan Institute have criticised the plan, warning it will lock in higher spending and make the structural budget deficit worse because fewer people are smoking. Now a leaked document from the Turnbull government\u2019s first budget \u2013 to be released on Tuesday \u2013 shows Labor\u2019s plan would raise billions of dollars less than it thinks. The treasury figures, seen by Guardian Australia, show Labor\u2019s plan will only raise $28.2bn over 10 years \u2013 a massive $19.5bn less than expected.   Related: Australian budget 2016: what we know, and what we don't    That will put huge pressure on Labor\u2019s $70bn spending plans, because Labor has been relying on the dramatically-higher tobacco excise to fund more than half of them. The revelation is being used by the Coalition to reinvigorate its attack on Labor as a high-spending, high-taxing party that has trouble controlling the budget.  The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told parliament on Monday \u2013 without referring to the budget document \u2013 that Labor would not be able to pay for its planned increase in education funding by relying on the tobacco excise. He said the Coalition\u2019s school funding plan was more sensible that Labor\u2019s. \u201cWe have been spending more and more on education but the outcomes have not been improving,\u201d Turnbull said on Monday. \u201cNow, the answer to that is ensuring that the taxpayers\u2019 dollars, the parents\u2019 dollars, are better deployed so that we get the better outcomes.\u201d The shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, in February said Labor\u2019s tobacco excise tax projections were \u201crock solid\u201d because they had been costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the budget leak was a \u201cdesperate attempt to cover for the fact the Government will be adopting, in full, Labor\u2019s policy on tobacco excise.\u201d  \u201cLabor\u2019s tobacco excise policy was fully and independently costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office.\u201d \u201cLabor has never directly hypothecated the revenue from tobacco excise for schools spending. It\u2019s just one of the savings proposal that Labor in opposition has outlined and there will be more to come,\u201d he said.",
