  "body": "Film producers like nothing more than a chest-burstingly uplifting, against-the-odds, underdog-come-good, overcoming-adversity story, and Leicester City\u2019s tilt at the Premier League title is about as chestburstingly uplifting as they come. So just as football journalists have been sharpening their pens and documentary-makers loading up their editing suites over the past few weeks as the Foxes have been closing in on the championship, film production executives will have begun the unseemly jostle to get Leicester City: The Movie in the works.  But how to go about it? The first issue is where to pitch it. Notoriously, most films about football \u2013 about British football, at least \u2013 have been pretty bad: hamstrung between the need to appeal to the widest possible only-vaguely-interested audience (ie, the US) while not alienating the rabid, intensely knowledgeable home support. The poorly received Goal! trilogy fell between every stool possible. (One of its writers, Adrian Butchart, is the man talking up a potential Jamie Vardy movie \u2013 but this, like much else in the film world, is a case of attempting to hype a film into existence.) The Damned United did a good job in dramatising Brian Clough\u2019s relationship with Peter Taylor, but the actual football left a bit to be desired. Mike Bassett: England Manager mined Graham Taylor\u2019s discomfiture for laughs, but Leicester City: The Movie won\u2019t be a vehicle for satire.           \u2018Walt Disney wouldn\u2019t script this\u2019 \u2013 Leicester City champions    Acquiring sources is an important part of the development process \u2013 especially in Hollywood, where producers are often hit with nuisance lawsuits claiming plagiarism. The Leicester Mercury\u2019s Rob Tanner looks to be ahead of the pack with 5000-1: The Leicester City Story \u2013 according to the publishers, no one has come in yet to pick up the rights, but that\u2019s surely a matter of time. This leads to the next question: are we looking at a cheeky, chirpy, cheapo British film; or a heartwarming all-guns-blazing Hollywood epic? Eddie the Eagle or Jerry Maguire? The Match or Rush? We could very well have duelling Leicester City movies on our hands, if the recent manoeuvres over another great news story, the Hatton Garden Job, are anything to go by. The outfit that brought us The Guvnors put a cheeky-chirpy British version swiftly into production, while a big-shot Hollywood producer announced a heist film with the possible involvement of Michael Caine. So who would play whom? Here\u2019s our stab at a cinematic teamsheet. The man at the helm     Who\u2019d bet against it? \u2026 Claudio Ranieri, AKA the Tinkerman, Leicester City managerl; and actor Tom Hanks. Photograph: Getty Images/WireImage    Claudio Ranieri, manager \u2013 played by Tom Hanks By any rights, the role ought to go to The Great Beauty star Toni Servillo, an authentically great Italian actor with the right blend of soul-searching whimsy. But after that crack about putting a bet on Leicester, Hanks has put himself firmly in the frame. If he\u2019s up for it, no contest. Best defence Kasper Schmeichel, goalkeeper \u2013 Tom Felton Felton \u2013 Draco Malfoy to you and me \u2013 is already a master of the bottle-blond look that Schmeichel has inherited from his dad. Christian Fuchs, full back \u2013 Christoph Waltz He might be a bit old to play a professional footballer, but Christoph \u201cBlofeld\u201d Waltz is probably the only German-speaking actor Anglo-American audiences will have heard of.  Danny Simpson, full back \u2013 Craig David A dodgy-musician cameo is a fine addition to any Hollywood film, and Simpson would appear to provide the best opportunity.      The big man \u2026 Leicester\u2019s victorious captain Wes Morgan; and Idris Elba. Photograph: PA/Getty Images    Wes Morgan, centre back \u2013 Idris Elba Imagine Luther in shorts. The Leicester captain, with his on-pitch gravitas and commanding physical presence, would be a decent cameo for a heavyweight British actor. Worth putting in a call to Elba.  Robert Huth, centre back \u2013 Matthias Schoenaerts Even though he\u2019s Belgian, Schoenaerts would be a good bet for the hulking German centre back, notorious for getting stuck in where it hurts. Might have to lose a little muscle bulk though, to approximate Huth\u2019s beanpole physique. Marking in the middle Danny Drinkwater, midfield \u2013 Jack O\u2019Connell There\u2019s got to be a place in the line-up for British cinema\u2019s current golden boy, star of \u201971 and Unbroken. Leicester\u2019s midfield engine room could be the pick. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, midfield \u2013 Omar Sy Sy, star of the massive French hit Intouchables, could make the role of the tough-tackling midfielder his own \u2013 plus help hoover up some of that chunky French box office, the biggest in Europe.     Mercurial \u2026 footballer of the year Riyad Mahrez; and actor Tahar Rahim. Photograph: Getty Images    Riyad Mahrez, midfield \u2013 Tahar Rahim The Algerian PFA player of the year has \u2013 spookily \u2013 his almost direct screen counterpart: French Algerian actor Rahim, star of epic gangster film A Prophet. If anyone can get inside the mercurial Mahrez\u2019s skin, it\u2019s him. Marc Albrighton, midfield \u2013 Matt Smith A boyish 26, Leicester\u2019s eager-beaver wide man isn\u2019t especially high in recognition terms, but floppy-haired former Doctor Who Smith has got a definite lookalike thing going on. Up front and personal     Well, he\u2019s got the hair \u2026 Jamie Vardy, record-breaking striker; and Tom Hiddleston Photograph: Getty Images    Jamie Vardy, forward \u2013 Tom Hiddleston The Foxes\u2019 goal-getter is their own breakout star, probably their only player recognisable to those not really interested in football. Unfortunately Wilfrid Brambell is no longer with us, so we\u2019ll probably just have to make do with Hiddleston: if he can play Hank Williams, he can play anyone. Shinji Okazaki, forward \u2013 Jackie Chan Japan isn\u2019t short of actors, but hardly any of the younger generation have got international recognition. Hollywood has never been shy of messing around with ethnic identities (see Memoirs of a Geisha), so let\u2019s throw Chan into the mix. Leonardo Ulloa, forward \u2013 Oscar Isaac A bit-part player in this season\u2019s events, but Ulloa has come good in the final reel to help see Leicester over the line. Since everyone loves Isaac after Inside Llewyn Davis, here\u2019s a good opportunity for a dramatic walk-on. Show me the money     Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, chairman; and the ever-versatile Tilda Swinton Composite: Rex/Getty Images    Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, chairman \u2013 Tilda Swinton Since no one outside the Leicester boardroom knows what the club\u2019s Thai chairman and CEO of King Power Duty Free, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, looks like, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they went for some serious stunt casting. After Swinton has finished playing the Ancient One in Doctor Strange, she might be fancied to take this on.",
