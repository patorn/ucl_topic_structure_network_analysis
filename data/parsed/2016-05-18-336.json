  "body": "The Queensland solicitor general was disqualified from giving advice to the government on the state\u2019s largest known defamation payout because he acted for Campbell Newman in his ill-fated defence. Peter Dunning drew up the defence for the then Queensland premier, which included accusing solicitor Chris Hannay of contempt of court and perverting the course of justice, and was taken as grounds for aggravated damages in a suit that was ultimately settled for $525,000. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the cost to taxpayers and ordered a review of indemnity guidelines after Guardian Australia revealed the payout and the refusal of Newman and his co-defendant, Jarrod Bleijie, to make a public apology that could have reduced it.   Related: Campbell Newman defamation case: taxpayers cover $525,000 payout    Dunning, as the government\u2019s top legal counsel, would ordinarily have advised the state on whether the settlement represented the best outcome for taxpayers. But his role acting for Newman \u2013 the first time a solicitor general has defended an individual minister in a libel suit since the role began in 1985 \u2013 created a conflict that prevented him giving that advice. Gabrielle Appleby, an associate professor of law at the University of New South Wales, said the conduct of the Newman case seemed \u201cunusual\u201d in light of ministers\u2019 obligation when represented by the solicitor general to act according to \u201cmodel litigant\u201d principles. \u201cOne of those principles is that the state or ministers don\u2019t take every defence that\u2019s available to them and they try to mitigate damages that the state has to pay in the event they\u2019re unsuccessful,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout seeing the details of the defence that was drafted and knowing the detail of why a public apology was not offered as part of the settlement negotiations, it does seem unusual that such a course was not considered by the state.\u201d Legal sources said the $525,000 settlement was believed to be the largest defamation payout in Queensland history. It eclipses the $400,000 paid by Channel Nine owner Alan Bond also in 1985 to the then premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, in what the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal found was \u201ccommercial blackmail\u201d. Dunning declined to comment on the settlement but said he was careful not to act in cases that were \u201cinconsistent with my role with the government\u201d. While Queensland is the only state that allows a solicitor general to maintain a substantial separate private legal practice, Dunning indicated he was not paid separately to act for Newman and Bleijie and stopped acting for them when they left office last year.  \u201cPlainly I couldn\u2019t have acted for them after they ceased to be the government whilst I was solicitor general, nor could I have acted for them in a private capacity whilst I was solicitor general,\u201d Dunning told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhatever other people might have done on the job, I am very careful that not only do I not take government work to be paid for, given I\u2019m on a retainer to the government, nor do I take instructions that are inconsistent with my role with the government.\u201d Guardian Australia asked the attorney general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, what advice the state received on the Newman settlement and why a public apology was not required. It also asked whether the review of indemnity guidelines would include the role for the solicitor-general acting for individual ministers who were sued. D\u2019Ath declined to comment. Dunning\u2019s predecessor, Walter Sofronoff, refrained from acting for ministers sued in office, including the then premier, Anna Bligh, when she was sued for defamation by Clive Palmer in 2009.   Related: Campbell Newman declares he will not run for federal seat    Palaszczuk told reporters on Monday that she wrote to her director general on the day of the settlement \u201casking him very clearly to revisit legal indemnity guidelines for ministers into the future\u201d. Palaszczuk said the government would \u201cgive serious consideration to the redrafting of those guidelines\u201d at a cabinet meeting next Monday.  \u201cLet me make it clear, the approval for the legal indemnity in this case was made under the former government,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on those specific details but, suffice to say, the new guidelines that will be in place will put a great deal of value on taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d The Solicitor General Act states that the role \u201cshall not permit or suffer a conflict of interests to exist between the practice of his or her profession and the proper discharge of his or her functions as solicitor general\u201d. To do so is \u201cgrounds for removal\u201d. Newman was targeted by the libel suit after responding in February 2014 to reports that Hannay had advised clients not to appear in court together for fear of being arrested under anti-association laws. He told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s completely disingenuous from the defence lawyers concerned and I am sure they have ways of dealing with that. That is just nonsense. \u201cThese people are hired guns. They take money from people who sell drugs to our teenagers and young people. \u201cYes, everybody\u2019s got a right to be defended under the law but you\u2019ve got to see it for what it is, they are part of the machine, part of the criminal gang machine and they will see, say and do anything to defend their clients and try to get them off or indeed progress their sort of case, their dishonest case.\u201d Bleijie was also targeted in the lawsuit after saying a day later that Newman was responding specifically to a question about \u201cHannay Lawyers on the Gold Coast\u201d. Hannay and his son Daniel, also a solicitor with his firm, alleged Bleijie\u2019s remarks helped identify them as the targets of Newman\u2019s attack. They filed a claim seeking $1.2m in aggravated damages from Newman and Bleijie in April 2014. Newman and Bleijie filed a defence that accused Chris Hannay of \u201can attempt to interfere with the administration of justice\u201d and contempt of court by advising clients not to front court together. The case went to mediation with former high court judge Ian Callinan.",
