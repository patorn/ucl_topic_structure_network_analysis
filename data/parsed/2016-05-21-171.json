  "body": "Come in \u2013 down Caesar! Sorry, he\u2019s very protective, no he\u2019s never bitt\u2014 well, only the once, did it not mention a dog? Here, I\u2019ll chain him up. Just step round the boxes, some stuff I\u2019m selling on eBay, so if you wanted to buy a reconditioned iPhone? Watch that mousetrap! Here\u2019s your room, oh dear, really, some of the guests, well they\u2019re not getting a good review, sorry I\u2019ve been out all day or I\u2019d have warned you, I\u2019ll get some bleach, you\u2019ll have it spotless in no time. Did it not say cleaning\u2019s extra? Sure, coat hangers are \u00a35 each. I\u2019m right next door so if you could keep the noise down, the walls are fairly thin \u2013 here\u2019s your bathroom, oh that\u2019s not very nice is it, let me put the lid down, the flush is a bit temperamental, mind, you want to depress and hold for exactly seven seconds, it\u2019s all on the note \u2013 you\u2019ve got loo paper? And towels? Didn\u2019t it say? You could use this flannel they\u2019ve left, until you\u2019ve bought some, or borrow ours, \u00a315 a day. House rules \u2013 the usual, no alcohol, no talking after 9pm, lights off at 10pm or you forfeit the deposit, hot water\u2019s on for an hour from 3am, additional times by arrangement, breakfast between 6.45 and 7am, the tray will be on the stairs \u2013 you\u2019re welcome to go into the kitchen, but it\u2019s very much Caesar\u2019s space. What else? Any ants, no problem, they\u2019re not the biting kind. And whatever you do, don\u2019t go in there. My stepson. If he comes out, don\u2019t meet his eye. Don\u2019t touch that shrine! Are you\u00a0interested in Moloch? There\u2019s a lot of occult power involved, so if\u00a0you do hear any unusual noises in the night, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019ll just be the spirits, completely harmless but you might want to stay in your\u00a0room. You\u2019ll sleep well, I always do, the great thing about this area is, the planes don\u2019t wake you until at least six. Now. Does either of you fancy a massage? It\u2019s a bit of a sideline of mine, actually, so now\u2019s your chance, before it gets busy.",
