Masterpiece of the week     William Hogarth \u2013 The Painter and his Pug (1745) Photograph: Tate    An oval self-portrait of Hogarth is propped on leather-bound volumes of the works of his favourite authors: Milton, Shakespeare and Swift. The palette in front of them is inscribed and illustrated with his philosophic idea of The Line of Beauty, which is serpentine, not straight, according to Hogarth \u2013 an idea that puts him at the heart of the European Rococo movement. But his pug dog brings such highfalutin speculations down to earth. Hogarth\u2019s own face mirrors the dog\u2019s ordinariness and toughness. Beauty is not only serpentine, it comes out fighting.\u2022 Tate Britain, London Image of the week     The Guvnors in their Sunday suits, Finsbury Park, London (1958) by Don McCullin Photograph: Don McCullin    Don McCullin\u2019s image of a street gang earned him his first credit in the Observer, kickstarting his career \u2013 this week he was named Master of Photography at Photo London and took part in a webchat with Guardian readers.
