  "body": "I recently went in for my annual cancer scans. Seven years into survivorship, I shrugged at the thought of it. No biggie, I thought. I\u2019ve got this. Scanxiety is for losers. I was still cocky at 8am. I had forgotten that after last year\u2019s gauntlet of tests, I had ripped my hospital ID card, chain and all, from around my neck and tossed it in a trash can in the parking lot. I forgot until this year, when I couldn\u2019t properly check in without it. I had to go get another one.    Related: MRIs terrify me. My cancer history means I must endure two a year, forever | Mary Elizabeth Williams    I felt the need to tell the nice lady who made me a new card, who assured me that people lost them all the time, that I hadn\u2019t lost it. I had thrown it away in a cinematic fashion, as if I were yanking off my tie and stomping away from my job. And then a huge explosion went off behind me and I just kept walking. She laughed, really laughed, and that made me feel better.  In the waiting room, I texted a friend, Anya. We like coming up with dream casts of movies based on books. \u201cNew movie\u201d I typed. She came right back with Excellent Women by Barbara Pym, a devastatingly witty tale of an English spinster and her peculiar love life. Casting began immediately with Rocky Napier, the dashing, flirtatious military man. \u201cTom Hiddleston IS Rocky Napier,\u201d Anya said. \u201cCheck,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost eerie.\u201d  We settled upon Adam Driver as the odd anthropologist Everard Bone. A few more characters in, and my name was called.  After the first event, a 45-minute blood draw with an IV, I texted Anya again. \u201cI cannot wait to get out of here,\u201d I said.  Anya was confused. All my advance talk of \u201cpractically a spa day\u201d \u2013 the robe; the free tea \u2013 and the movie banter had led her to believe that, seven years on, cancer was in my rearview mirror. I would\u2019ve thought so too.  But it always follows me. I try to fake it out by pretending things are OK. If I pretend, I can sort of believe it too, for a time. So I pulled Anya into fantasyland with me, until I couldn\u2019t.  There I sat with a taped-over IV in my arm, which was left in so that the next event, an injection of radioactive isotopes for a bone scan, would be smooth sailing. Because I am allergic to the sort of medical tape usually used to strap this business into place, my little arm-tube gets wrapped up in a comfy sock-like cloud, a perfect cushion to try and get some writing done. I really need to mention here that I spent a good two years in these environs. I know full well there are only a few things that can be done in waiting rooms. Pawing through greasy magazines. Staring into space. Discussing minutiae slowly with your friend or family member. Frantic texting. These fun activities are all served with a complimentary side of cold sweat.  \u201cI am eating a gigantic and revolting cinnamon roll from a coffee shop called Grand Grounds,\u201d I texted Anya. \u201cMy arm has a diaper. I\u2019m about to carb-cry in public.\u201d \u201cI wish I was there with you!\u201d she said.  \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, seriously,\u201d I said.

This was beyond even my denial capabilities. I wanted to walk out the door of the hospital and never, ever come back, but I was staring down the barrel of a 50-minute bone scan, starring me, wrapped up human-burrito style. \u201cThis is actually the worst,\u201d I texted Anya. She was getting ping-ponged by my moods. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever talk about it?\u201d she asked.  \u201cI\u2019m really, really tired of the topic of cancer,\u201d I said. It seems like everyone has cancer or has had cancer or has dead or dying relatives and friends. I really try not to be a Debbie Downer about it, and I don\u2019t want to be a bore. I am not always successful. Plus, there are survivors who really do walk on sunshine for the rest of their days, run marathons, savor each morning\u2019s ever-sweeter dew. I feel that I have somehow failed for not being all inspirational and zesty in perpetuity. \u201cThe ongoing horror of survivorship is a big, dirty secret,\u201d I said. \u201cThey make CANCER SUCKS coffee mugs, but I\u2019ve never seen a SURVIVORSHIP SUCKS one.\u201d I don\u2019t know if I have cancer cells hiding, waiting to mass again. Did that experimental breast cancer vaccine teach my healthy cells to think differently? Are all the fruits and vegetables I scarf daily doing anything? And the miles of walking? All I know is that I am holding steady in a state called No Evidence of Disease. \u201cHow about a CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVE mug?\u201d Anya replied.  \u201cI need to find a new therapist,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you for your support.\u201d The closing ceremony was a visit with my oncologist. After the physical exam, she told me that everything looked great on all my bloodwork, but a tumor marker that had been stable for years had gone up a bit. Is there a word that means \u201csudden and extreme onset of clamminess\u201d? I immediately began to chastise myself for everything I\u2019ve done wrong as a survivor, including not eating a raw, sugar-free diet, not doing triathalons, and not being super positive at all times. Even though I know all of that is no guarantee that my cancer won\u2019t come back. Just a fluctuation, my doctor said. No big deal. The nurse piped up that if someone didn\u2019t know any better, and they saw my paperwork, they\u2019d wonder how this perfectly healthy woman got mixed up in this bunch. \u201cNo evidence of metastatic disease,\u201d my doctor said, with an authoritative nod. I felt so wobbly after that I had to log some more time on a sad chair instead of literally running to my car and laying rubber in the parking lot. I texted Anya. Things like \u201cGwyneth diet\u201d, \u201cjogging\u201d, \u201cdumbass\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Midge in Vertigo pulling my hair and saying, \u2018stupid! stupid! stupid!\u2019\u201d \u201cBut things are OK,\u201d Anya said.   Related: I had alcohol-related breast cancer. Here\u2019s why I still drink | Joanna Moorhead    \u201cYes, it could be worse.\u201d I\u2019m not being kept in a box and tortured. I am free. I live a pretty great life, relatively speaking. Death stalks us all; that\u2019s the nature of being a beast. Maybe survivors are just a bit more aware of it. I cope with walks, my go-to for any kind of problem-solving. I cope with rude jokes, if only in my head. I cope by actively redirecting my thoughts, which might be constructive ingenuity \u2013 or plain denial. Or I don\u2019t cope and just feel sorry for myself and also freak out.  Still, it\u2019s downright liberating to complain about being a survivor. I can complain. I will complain! And then, having done so, I will shrug and say, \u201cbut seriously, it could be worse.\u201d",
