Related: 'Riding roughshod over democracy': residents on fracking in North Yorkshire    Tests for shale gas can now take place in the village of Kirby Misperton, in the Ryedale district, after councillors gave the green light to UK firm Third Energy. The decision was greeted with boos, jeers and honking horns from crowds of anti-fracking campaigners outside County Hall in Northallerton, where residents raised fears of catastrophic seismic activity, health problems and pollution during a rancorous two-day hearing. It paves the way for the first fracking test in Britain since 2011, when tests on the Fylde coast were found to have been the probable cause of minor earthquakes in the area. Since then, two high-profile applications to frack in Lancashire have been rejected by councillors and are the subject of appeals. Opponents fear fracking \u2013 in which chemical-filled liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture rock and release gas \u2013 can cause problems including water contamination, earthquakes and noise and traffic pollution. Environmentalists warn that pursuing new sources of gas \u2013 a fossil fuel \u2013 is not compatible with efforts to tackle climate change.  North Yorkshire county council received 4,375 objections and just 36 letters in support of Third Energy\u2019s plans to frack for shale gas at its existing well in Kirby Misperton, known as KM8. The council\u2019s own officials backed the proposal earlier this month and the Tory-dominated planning committee formally gave it the go-ahead by a majority of seven votes to four on Monday night. David Cameron and his ministers will welcome the development. The prime minister said in 2014 that the government was \u201cgoing all out for shale\u201d and the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, said after the general election that she would \u201cdeliver shale\u201d. In August, ministers said they would intervene in planning applications following industry frustrations that local authorities were not moving quickly enough. Tensions ran high during the hearing in Northallerton, where the festival-like atmosphere among demonstrators turned sour when pro-fracking experts addressed councillors on Monday. Tory councillor Peter Sowray, leader of the planning committee, conceded after the vote that the process had caused deep wounds within the local community that would take time to heal. \u201cPeople are going to be angry. It will take time to calm down \u2013 for some people it never will,\u201d he said. Sowray, who voted in favour of the proposal, said there was not going to be \u201chundreds of wells\u201d and stressed that his committee\u2019s approval was limited to work at one site. \u201cThere may be more applications,\u201d he said. \u201cThis application will prejudice future applications.\u201d Outside the County Hall, there were chants of \u201cWe say no\u201d and \u201cYou will be held accountable\u201d as protesters vowed to continue to fight the plans.  Christopher Pickles, a 78-year-old resident of Hovingham, a village 10 miles from the frack site, said the vote would make campaigners \u201credouble our efforts\u201d and consider a legal challenge.   Related: In the timeless Yorkshire moors of my childhood, the frackers are poised to start drilling    Councillors heard at the meeting on Monday that North Yorkshire police were investigating allegations that anti-fracking activists hacked the email accounts of five parish councils to send bogus emails objecting to Third Energy\u2019s bid. The murky development came amid growing acrimony in the rolling North Yorkshire countryside, with Third Energy bosses accusing its opponents of misleading counsellors by using underhand tactics, scaremongering and dramatic performances. One pro-fracking B&B owner was jeered with chants of \u201cShame on you!\u201d by demonstrators as she spoke in favour of the plans. Third Energy rolled out a series of executives and experts to counter concerns surrounding noise, water pollution and even potential earthquakes. The firm argued there would be \u201cno significant disturbance from noise\u201d and that the risks to water contamination were \u201cvirtually zero\u201d in spite of \u201can awful lot of scaremongering\u201d. One expert produced a graphic showing the scale of the 37-metre gas drilling rig compared with the 55-metre Cliff Hanger ride at the theme park Flamingo Land, which is less than a mile away from the fracking well. Third Energy\u2019s commercial director, Ian Gair, said he had not been planning to speak but felt compelled to counter the \u201cwhat I can only call performances\u201d from anti-fracking campaigners. \u201cDo not be cowed by cries of foul play or precedent setting,\u201d he told councillors, adding: \u201cWould you stifle a child at birth for fear of what it would grow into?\u201d Shaun Zablocki, the company\u2019s operations support manager and a self-described \u201cScarborough lad\u201d, attacked the \u201coutrageous statements\u201d and \u201cglaring inaccuracy\u201d of some of the anti-fracking objectors. \u201cIt is hard to understand their motives as being anything other than disingenuous and attempts to mislead the committee,\u201d he said. Speaking before the decision was announced, Third Energy\u2019s chief executive, Rasik Valand, implored the councillors to judge the application on its merits. He denied that fracking would deal a blow to tourism in the region, suggesting that the \u201cnegative publicity\u201d brought about by its objectors would have a more detrimental effect. \u201cIt is important to take a step back and focus on what is the issue: hydraulic fracturing, two to three kilometres in the ground on an existing well that has been operating for a long time \u2026 for two months,\u201d he said. \u201cThis application like every other application can only be considered on its merits. I urge you to please consider this application in line with the approval from your planning officer.\u201d  In a press conference after the vote, Valand said his \u201coverwhelming reaction\u201d was relief. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey for us. We started this journey when we drilled a well two years ago,\u201d he said. Valand said he did not see the decision as setting a precedent that could open the door for fracking across Britain, but said further tests would now need to be carried out. Earlier, independent councillor John Blackie prompted jubilant cheers from the crowds outside when he said the \u201chighly damaging\u201d fracking plans fell \u201cwell short\u201d of convincing him. Local tourism and agriculture would be put in peril by approving the plan, he claimed. He said it could lead to fracking in Ryedale \u201cfor ever and ever and ever\u201d and that other gas firms would follow Third Energy\u2019s lead. \u201cAs sure as God made little apples, others will follow and that has not escaped the attention of the objectors who fear that our tourism and agriculture is doomed if this application goes ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a shot in the dark and I see no compelling reason why North Yorkshire should be the guinea pig when those impacted have so much to lose.\u201d",
