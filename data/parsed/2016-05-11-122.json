  "body": "Fears of a broad slump in the art market were eased Tuesday night at Christie\u2019s, where records were set for six postwar-contemporary artists including Mike Kelley and Jean-Michel Basquiat. While the sale, which raised $318m, is a vertiginous drop from the billion-dollar auctions the market enjoyed last year, auctioneers and dealers breathed a sigh of relief that the experience at Sotheby\u2019s impressionist and modern sale the previous evening, when almost half the lots went unsold, was not repeated.    Related: How 2015 may have marked the end of the art market's boom years    Basquiat\u2019s horned devil\u2019s head Untitled, from 1982, widely considered a masterwork by the then 22-year-old artist \u2013 despite lacking any of the painter\u2019s characteristic graffiti \u2013 fetched $57m, including seller\u2019s fees.  The buyer, Christie\u2019s global head of postwar and contemporary art Brett Gorvy, later revealed, was an anonymous Japanese telephone bidder. The seller was Adam Lindemann, a New York collector who bought it for $4.5m just 12 years ago.  Christie\u2019s officials said they had had a tense day ahead of the sale. \u201cWe had a big challenge because of what happened last night,\u201d Gorvy said. The events at Sotheby\u2019s the previous evening had left the market shaken. A third of lots on offer went unsold with sales plunging 61% from a year earlier, reaching just $144.5m in what was Sotheby\u2019s worst showing at an evening sale in the category since the 2009 recession. Last night\u2019s sale, Gorvy said, would go some way to reassuring collectors that they would be positioned as \u201cthe last man or woman standing\u201d if they continued to buy despite signs of a global economic slowdown and mounting tension around upcoming elections, including in the US. \u201cThe most challenging aspect we have is keeping people\u2019s confidence focused,\u201d Gorvy told the Guardian. \u201cThe desire is there, the art is there, but if you take away the confidence it all falls apart. If you can show it\u2019s a market for serious collectors, we can hand-pick works and then we can say confidently to our clients, \u2018This is your time\u2019.\u201d  At the Christie\u2019s sale, 52 of the 60 offered lots found buyers. In addition to Kelley and Basquiat, records were set for Agnes Martin, Kerry James Marshall, Barry X Ball and Richard Prince, whose Runaway Nurse from 2007 went for $9.7m. There was some disappointment for sellers, with a dark blue-green Mark Rothko No 17 finding only one bidder and selling for just over its low estimate at $32.6m. Art adviser Abigail Asher said the sale represented a relatively straightforward picture of the high end of the art market. She added that the days of the billion-dollar sale or frantic competitive bidding are over and that the market is austere, in part, because the auction houses have ceased offering direct guarantees to sellers. Both leading auction houses found that the practice, while helpful in bringing top quality work to market, was a perilous exercise. Sotheby\u2019s in particular was left holding a significant quantity of work from last year\u2019s estate sale of the property developer Alfred Taubman. That work, which has failed at market, now belongs to the auction house. It isn\u2019t a market-wide collapse: the market for contemporary art remains stronger and deeper than for impressionist and modern. That was borne out on Monday night when Sotheby\u2019s took the brunt of the shift. While not as bad, Christie\u2019s and Phillips\u2019 postwar and contemporary art auctions also booked less business.  Christie\u2019s specialty, 39-lot Bound to Fail sale included Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s Him (2001), a sinister sculpture of a kneeling, penitent Hitler, which went for $17.2m, a record for the artist. Records were also set for a Richard Prince sculpture, Anyone Can Find Me (1989\u201390) and for a Bruce Nauman video piece, No, No, New Museum (1987). Christie\u2019s sold 97% by lot for $78.1m, well over the low estimate of $59.4m. Sotheby\u2019s bad night was offset only by the sale of Auguste Rodin\u2019s marble L\u2019Eternel Printemps, which sold for an above-estimate $20.4m. On the same day, the publicly listed house announced a larger than expected loss for the first quarter. Still, certain trends are emerging, particularly for women artists, among them Helen Frankenthaler, Agnes Martin, Bridget Riley. \u201cThere is a huge thrust of interest in women artists and minority artists because they have been ignored culturally,\u201d explains British dealer Ivor Braka. \u201cSo there is a certain sense of political motivation.\u201d But no artist better exemplifies contemporary art as the hottest category in the market than Basquiat, a celebrity in death with a celebrity following, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Jay Z. \u201cThis was not his best work but it\u2019s not terrible,\u201d explained biographer Phoebe Hoban.  \u201cHere\u2019s an artist who died tragically young, who had tremendous energy and represents a time in New York that\u2019s over. There\u2019s nothing new to his appeal but he sells because he\u2019s best of the 80s artists. He\u2019s a brand, an investment, and you can always flip them.\u201d",
