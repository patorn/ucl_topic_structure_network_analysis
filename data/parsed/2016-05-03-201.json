The Republic\u2019s 12.5% corporate tax rate \u2013 one of the lowest in Europe \u2013 makes the country an attractive prospect for multinationals, and a stroll through what has inevitably come to be known as the Silicon Docks area of Dublin will take you past the European headquarters of Google, Facebook and eBay, to name just a few. But these big beasts are only one thread in Dublin\u2019s tech tapestry. The startup scene is thriving too, with thousands of early and mid-stage firms innovating within the worlds of fintech, travel tech and edtech in particular.  \u201cWe\u2019re very much more of a B2B [business to business] enterprise city than a consumer internet city,\u201d says Niamh Bushnell, Dublin\u2019s first commissioner for startups. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a home market per se, so we specialise in areas that make sense to us and that are big globally. So we think internationally and connect internationally from a very early stage.\u201d Dublin was ranked just outside the world\u2019s top 20 startup ecosystems in reporting firm Compass\u2019s Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking 2015, but it was a close thing. The value of the city\u2019s startup ecosystem is now estimated at around $2.8bn, according to a Compass spokesperson, compared with a figure of $43.9bn for London and $9bn for Amsterdam. But in terms of total numbers of startups, the Irish capital is punching well above its weight, with roughly the same number as Amsterdam (around 2,250), a city with more than three times the population.     There are certain people who just like working for startups. The energy is there. They know what they\u2019re getting into.  Dr Patricia Scanlon, founder and CEO, Soapbox Labs     It is a scenario that works to Dublin\u2019s advantage, says Bushnell. \u201cYou\u2019re always bumping into people on the street \u2013 literally, you meet the same people over and over again, so you can build relationships pretty quickly. All of that really benefits the startups that are \u2018born\u2019 here but also the international startups \u2013 they can get into the community very quickly.\u201d Dr Patricia Scanlon, founder and CEO of Soapbox Labs, which makes literacy software for children, can attest to the advantages of this small, \u201cvery social\u201d scene in terms of the support available at the beginning of the startup journey. \u201cI found it very easy to wrap my head around where the funding was, what\u2019s the best route, how to hire, the lowdown on all the accelerators,\u201d she says. There are downsides to a startup ecosystem on this scale, however. Rhona Togher, co-founder and CEO of health tech firm Restored Hearing, which has developed a sound therapy for tinnitus, raised seed funding in Ireland, but has had no option but to look abroad when it comes to series A cash. The home market is just too small and risk-averse as far as Togher\u2019s particular niche is concerned. That said, she has found the local venture capitalist (VC) community supportive in other ways. \u201cI\u2019ve met with almost every VC here in Dublin and they\u2019ve said, \u2018This might not fit our portfolio but here\u2019s a list of 10 people who you can talk to who would be able to help or might be interested in investing\u2019.\u201d Togher\u2019s experience is far from unique. Quoting figures from a recent report by the Irish Venture Capital Association, Bushnell says: \u201c46% of investments that were made into Irish startups in 2015 were from international investors.\u201d The proportion of foreign investment is on the up: \u20ac241m in 2015 compared with \u20ac132m the previous year. What the Dublin startup scene lacks in larger-scale, homegrown investment opportunities, it makes up for in state and local authority-funded programmes enabling entrepreneurs to navigate this landscape. Bodies like Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland provide support to startups at all stages of development, through mentoring, research, relationship brokering and much more.  Talent is in plentiful supply on the Dublin scene. The presence of Trinity College Dublin, Ireland\u2019s top university, is a factor, but international companies also play a major role. \u201cOur trick,\u201d says Bushnell, \u201cis to make sure that what they\u2019re doing in Ireland is valuable; up-skilling the people that they\u2019re employing.\u201d Smaller firms can have their work cut out tempting talent away from the big players, say both Scanlon and Togher, but neither entrepreneur has had any problem hiring people for key roles, thanks to what Scanlon identifies as \u201ca buzz about the tech startup scene\u201d.

They know what they\u2019re getting into.\u201d That buzz is something Bushnell is keen to build on. It\u2019s one of the main reasons why her office, Startup Dublin, was set up in the first place. Traditionally, she says, Dublin has been \u201creally bad at telling its story\u201d. But not anymore: in December 2015 Startup Dublin released information on 1,200 startups based in the city. Over the coming months they\u2019ll be following up with a web platform that will enable stakeholders in the city and around the world to engage more deeply with the scene there. \u201cWe want to be credible, we want to be on a par with the way people are talking globally and we want to have the data for it,\u201d says Bushnell. \u201cFinally we can say, \u2018Here it is; crunch the numbers; knock yourself out\u2019.\u201d Restored Hearing received early stage funding and support from Wayra, the Telefonica startup accelerator.
