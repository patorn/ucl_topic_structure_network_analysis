New research by the UN\u2019s great apes survival partnership (Grasp) points to an alarming rise in trafficking of orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos stolen from the wild, mostly to feed demand from a boom in macabre Chinese circuses.         But an increasing number are also finding their way to the private gardens and restaurants of the Gulf elite, and Grasp fears that the trade is being accelerated by celebrity endorsements.   Doug Cress, the programme\u2019s coordinator, told the Guardian: \u201cThe paparazzi shots of Paris Hilton and football star James Rodriguez and others cuddling baby orangutans at private zoos in Dubai are incredibly damaging to conservation efforts, and Grasp calls on celebrities to avoid such photo opportunities.\u201d  Photos of Paris Hilton with a dressed-up baby orangutan at the Saif Belhasas private zoo in Dubai began circulating in 2014. \u201cShe\u2019s the cutest little girl in the world,\u201d Hilton reportedly said of the ape.   Last December, the Real Madrid star James Rodriguez uploaded a photo of himself with an orangutan in Dubai to his Instagram account, despite strong condemnation by Grasp.   The rapper Kid Ink also posted an Instagram shot of himself with an orangutan dressed in baby clothes in Dubai two months ago, as did Khloe Kardashian.   None of the celebrities\u2019 agents responded to emailed requests for comment.  Cress said: \u201cThese pictures are seen by hundreds of millions of fans, and it sends the message that posing with great apes \u2013 all of which are obtained through illegal means, and face miserable lives once they grow too big and strong to hold \u2013 is okay as long as it\u2019s cute. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s illegal, and it contributes to the destruction of already endangered species.\u201d Grasp says that United Arab Emirates permitting records show that no import licenses for baby orangutans were issued that could match with the apes visible in the celebrity photographs.        Research that Grasp will publish later this year shows that 49 chimpanzees have been recovered since January 2014, a figure indicating that a minimum of 490 chimpanzees were killed during smuggling operations in this period.  Because fully-grown apes cannot be easily trafficked, smugglers prefer to steal babies from the wild. For every one baby chimpanzee taken, an average of 10 will be killed trying to defend it. But Grasp sees even this figure as the tip of the iceberg. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting a fraction of the total,\u201d said Cress. The proliferation of seizures in the Middle East is \u201cextremely worrying\u201d to the group, suggesting that regional instability is making the area an increasingly attractive transit zone for smugglers moving their cargo to Asia. A Grasp investigation is planned into the area\u2019s trade dynamics. Iraqi Kurdistan and Armenia are thought to be hotspots for the wildlife black market, while Libya has been a stopover for trafficked apes on the way to Egypt, since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. The road from Alexandria to Cairo has long been considered a \u201cswinging door\u201d out of Africa for animals being moved east, and some Red Sea Coast hotels are believed to act as holding centres. \u201cWealthy and untouchable people in Egypt own those hotels and have private zoos for guests which flush animals through at all times \u2013 and apes are a huge piece of that traffic,\u201d Cress said. \u201cIt is hard to close down because elites in the Mideast are hard to reach. It is not a public opinion thing. It is about reaching a select number of people who control the power.\u201d       The role played by Middle East elites in illegal trafficking is a growing concern for Grasp, but the end destination for stolen animals is usually the far east. In China, around a thousand theme parks for the country\u2019s emerging middle class have opened since 2000. \u201cMost of the apes there quickly end up riding bicycles and shooting each other with toy guns,\u201d Cress said. \u201cThe orangutans are used in boxing shows for cheap laughs. It is like cowboys and Indians or cops and robbers. They just clobber each other.\u201d With live gorilla\u2019s each in China selling for $42,000 \u2013 and chimpanzees for $26,000 \u2013 corruption linked to the ape trade has become widespread. Last October, Guinea\u2019s chief wildlife officer and Cites representative, Ansoumane Doumbouya, was arrested for allegedly trafficking the animals he was supposed to be protecting. Often animals are recovered by accident \u2013 one crate subdivided into six boxes and marked as carrying dogs \u2013 was sent back to Nairobi from Cairo, after fingers were seen peeping out of its slats. The traumatised baby chimps inside were eventually found going round and round on the airport carousel. In the past seven years, there were just 27 arrests around the world for trafficking in apes. A quarter of the cases were never prosecuted.",
