  "body": "Diving intrepidly into the Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics, the Telegraph has unearthed a troubling new paper for all fans of Mary Norton. According to Jonathan G Panuelos and Laura H Green\u2019s What Would the World Be Like to a Borrower?, it seems Arrietty, Pod and Homily would have rather a tough time of it. Being 16 times smaller than an average human, they would \u201close heat much faster than humans do\u201d, they\u2019d have terrible hearing, their speaking voices would be \u201cmuch higher than any human speaking naturally\u201d so they\u2019d be unable to talk to humans. And with scaled-down eyes, they would be \u201cnearly blind, as very little light would enter [their] eyes\u201d, according to the paper. \u201cBorrowers, as depicted in the film, could not exist, as a variety of both physical and biological factors make such a creature \u2026 unviable. Any human isometrically scaled down 16-fold would experience a variety of problems, having reduced hearing and vision, extremely high voice pitch, and be unable to maintain normal body temperatures,\u201d write the authors. Shockingly, then, it seems that the Clock family and their adventures in The Borrowers and its sequels were nothing more than a figment of Norton\u2019s imagination. A figment that won her the Carnegie medal, no less, but still \u2013 she was making things up. What does this mean for other classics from my childhood, I wonder? Is there going to be research showing that spirits couldn\u2019t really have existed in Lucy M Boston\u2019s Green Knowe? Might Will Stanton\u2019s magical powers as an Old One in Susan Cooper\u2019s The Dark is Rising sequence actually be scientifically impossible? Could a Psammead really grant wishes? Clearly this is an area in which much, much more research is needed. I\u2019m happy to volunteer, of course, but the thing that\u2019s really worrying me is that I\u2019m due to be spending five hours in the car with the family this afternoon and have downloaded an audiobook of The Borrowers to see us through. Here\u2019s hoping I don\u2019t get a lecture on the relationship between surface area and heat loss from the back seat \u2026",
