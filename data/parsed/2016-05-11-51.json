  "body": "After declining to endorse Donald Trump last week, Paul Ryan on Wednesday said he hoped an upcoming meeting with the presumptive Republican nominee would begin the process of unifying the party in order to defeat Hillary Clinton in November. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, one day before Trump is to meet Ryan and other Republicans on Capitol Hill, the House speaker said the stakes were too high to gloss over and fail to address the lingering differences within the party.    Related: US election delegate tracker: who's winning the presidential nomination?    \u201cTo pretend we\u2019re unified as a party after coming through a very bruising primary, which just ended like a week ago, to pretend we\u2019re unified without actually unifying, then we go into the fall at half strength,\u201d Ryan said at his weekly press conference. \u201cThis election is too important to go into an election at half strength. That means that we need a real unification of our party. Which, look, after a tough primary that\u2019s going to take some effort.\u201d Ryan stunned many in Washington with his announcement last week that he was not yet ready to support Trump, laying bare an unprecedented distance between the highest ranking Republican in the nation and the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, who for the next six months will serve as its standard bearer in the general election. At least a few rank-and-file members stood up in a closed-door Republican conference meeting to express their discomfort with Ryan\u2019s declaration, according to a source in the room. There were others who were instead supportive of Ryan\u2019s statement, reflecting the deepening chasm among Republicans who are damned if they embrace Trump and damned if they don\u2019t. Some House Republicans have stated publicly that they will not back Trump as the nominee, particularly those from key battleground states, such as Illeana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Scott Rigell of Virginia. At the same time, there are those Republicans hailing from more conservative districts who are under growing pressure to rally around Trump. Trump struck a conciliatory tone toward Ryan during an interview on Wednesday, telling conservative radio host Don Imus the House speaker is \u201ca very good person [who] loves the party and loves the country\u201d. \u201cMaybe more than anything else, we have to get to know each other,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI really think probably we\u2019ll come out with something that\u2019s going to be good, I hope, otherwise I\u2019ll just continue on the path that I continue on.\u201d Trump is scheduled to meet Republican leaders in Congress on Thursday, including a separate meeting with Ryan and Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee.  Ryan has routinely criticized Trump\u2019s controversial statements, from banning Muslim immigration into the US to the real estate mogul\u2019s initial refusal to disavow the endorsement of a former Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke. The two men also have vast policy differences, ranging from entitlement reform to trade to immigration.  Ryan was mum on what he would need to hear from Trump in order for the billionaire to secure his confidence, confessing that they had met only once, in 2012, when Ryan was Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential nominee. \u201cI don\u2019t really know him,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe just need to get to know each other and we as a leadership team are enjoying the fact that we have a chance to meet with him.\u201d   Related: Sanders' end game: keep the message alive even as nomination slips away    Ryan\u2019s counterpart Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, issued a tepid endorsement of Trump following the crushing victory in the Indiana primary last week that forced his only remaining rivals, Texas senator Ted Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich, out of the race.  While at least three Republican senators \u2013 Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Dean Heller of Nevada \u2013 have come out against Trump, others returning to Washington after a weeklong recess appeared resigned to accepting him as the nominee.  Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who engaged in a bitter feud with Trump while competing for the Republican nomination, said on Tuesday he would honor the pledge he signed as a candidate to support the nominee. Even so, he maintained his prior criticisms and reservations about Trump and declined to explicitly say if he would vote for him in November.  Senator Kelly Ayotte, who faces a tough re-election fight in New Hampshire, also sought to walk a fine line by stating she would support and vote for Trump but not offer him a formal endorsement.  Republicans are defending 24 Senate seats in November, many of which are in states won by Barack Obama in previous election cycles. Trump also risks potentially expanding the competitive electoral map to states such as Arizona, where Senator John McCain recently confessed at a private fundraiser that having the former reality TV star at the top of the ticket would make his re-election \u201cthe race of my life\u201d. Senator Pat Toomey, once thought to be in a more comfortable race in Pennsylvania, responded to Trump\u2019s nomination by penning an op-ed in one of his home state\u2019s newspapers seeking to distance himself from many of Trump\u2019s outlandish proposals and comments toward women, immigrants and Muslims. \u201cTrump was not my first, second, or third choice. I object to much in his manner and his policies,\u201d Toomey wrote. \u201cWinning the nomination is a great accomplishment, but it does not mean party members check their judgment at the door.\u201d Even so, Toomey added he was \u201cinclined to support\u201d the nominee of his party. Other influential Republicans were more openly prepared to embrace Trump, including Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Senate intelligence committee chief, and Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Corker downplayed Trump\u2019s brash demeanor, telling reporters that Republican primary voters wanted \u201ca personality and someone who is irreverent\u201d but that the campaign had now entered a second phase, drilling down on policy. \u201cWhen people say \u2018Never this or never that\u2019, I think a better place to be is to chill and let the campaign evolve a little bit and see where the candidate ends up,\u201d Corker said. Susan Collins, a senator from Maine who has often broken with her party on key issues, said she expected to eventually support Trump as long as he could assume the role of a more serious general election candidate. \u201cHe needs to reach out to Republicans, articulate more clearly what a Trump presidency would look like, and he needs to tone down and abandon the personal insults that have marred his campaign,\u201d she said.",
