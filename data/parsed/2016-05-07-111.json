A victory, dare we imagine it, would add his name to the annals of boxing history and crown him boxing royalty \u2013 and yet Khan still doesn\u2019t get his due. To have a gifted and remarkable champion so undervalued in Britain is a blot on the game. A career in the glare of a boxing community and media that doggedly question his abilities attack his worth as a top boxer. This is a Pakistani man from a working-class northern town who has twice captured world titles, beaten some of the best of his era and whose inability to admit defeat has hooked spectators for over a decade.   Related: Amir Khan v Canelo \u00c1lvarez: in the end it all boils down to weight    In her magnum opus on boxing Joyce Carol Oates wrote about the super-human effort required to be a boxer: \u201cThe punishment \u2013 to the body, the brain, the spirit \u2013 that a man must endure \u2026 is inconceivable to the rest of us.\u201d Amir\u2019s perseverance and physical discipline at his level is exemplary. The insults come, though, and a one that arrives like clockwork is the prevalence of a glass jaw. Its sting is twofold; the speed and technical skill that make him sharp in the ring is overlooked. And, ever unanswerable, at every match he has to face down his critics anew. They did get to him. He felt he had to answer doubters after a historic win with Marcos Maidana, facing punches with a heart that at the end delivered two fractured hands and a quip: \u201cI\u2019ve proved tonight I\u2019ve got a chin.\u201d He\u2019s also weathered unnecessary personal comments, too. He\u2019s apologised just for having fun with his success \u2013 forced to remove an innocent photograph in a club of him clutching fake money. He\u2019s distanced himself from his spending on fast cars and watches in which he found so much pleasure. The more humble side of his character \u2013 the humanitarian work, investment in local kids, loyalty to his family \u2013 is a bit lost. Well, Brits really bristle at showy over-confidence. You only have to look at how Lewis Hamilton, the three-times F1 world champion of the diamond studs and pop-star ex-girlfriends, is branded \u2018unlikeable\u2019 or \u2018unloveable\u2019 by the press. The elephant in the room is that the disparaging comments faced by both sports stars are skewed by issues of race. You can wade through the negativity and racist commentary posted on boxing websites, forums and press. Spectators boo and direct racial abuse from stands beyond the ring, the boxer\u2019s twitter feed is full of racial abuse. Why? His self-promotion? It reveals the febrile, charged environment that Khan has faced in the UK. The abuse leveled at him goes way beyond what should be reasonable in sports rivalry.   Related: Amir Khan, the road to Vegas \u2013 in pictures    So when America embraces him it\u2019s great to watch. At the tail end of his career he\u2019s found more personal satisfaction here in the US, where he receives more respect and admiration than at home. The country has rewarded his unwavering search for the best fights in the world and now, finally, he\u2019s top dog \u2013 his face lit up on electronic billboards across the Las Vegas Strip. In the face of his detractors, Amir Khan behaves like a proper Brit \u2013 with a shrug of the shoulders and mind to move on. He beams with pride representing his country. This love is sewn into his shorts, it\u2019s encrusted in diamonds on his fight kit and in the energy he uses to wave the British flag. And at the heart of what makes Amir Khan the most watchable, entertaining and enthralling boxers in the world today is an unbreakable spirit and courage. American promoters want him because they know he will stake everything. It\u2019s why millions of viewers will pay to watch him on Saturday night. His ambition burns as brightly now, a mature boxer of 29, as it did in those youthful early days in Athens. If he wins against Canelo he\u2019ll rightly be swamped with accolades and be recognised as a British hero. Even if he loses, his legacy and commitment to British boxing is still one the country can be proud of.",
