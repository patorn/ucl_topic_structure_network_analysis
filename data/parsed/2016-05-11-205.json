They knew it was our last game. They knew there would be congestion, so they should have come earlier,\u201d West Ham\u2019s co-chairman told BBC Radio 5 Live. \u201cThere is jealousy towards Manchester United because everybody feels they get treated specially,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey\u2019ve been treated specially again here tonight. If you check the coach, there won\u2019t be any damage to it. If we arrived late at Old Trafford they wouldn\u2019t put the kick-off back.\u201d   Related: David Sullivan back-tracks on blaming Manchester United for Upton Park violence    More than six hours later and as images of the United team bus being pelted with bottles as it arrived for the final game at Upton Park were being plastered over back pages of almost every national newspaper, West Ham published a statement on their website which praised 99% of supporters for behaving \u201cimpeccably\u201d but finally acknowledged that the scenes were \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and promised to ban those responsible for life. For many, however, it was too little, too late. When questioned about his comments early on Wednesday morning, a source close to Sullivan claimed he was unaware of exactly what had happened to United\u2019s bus outside the ground, which begs the question why he decided to offer such an inflammatory opinion if he wasn\u2019t in full possession of the facts? In the week in which the club proudly trumpeted their achievement of selling more than 50,000 season tickets for their imminent move to the Olympic Stadium, it was hardly the best PR move. The vice-chairman Karren Brady \u2013 a long-term associate of Sullivan and co-chairman David Gold \u2013 attempted a damage-limitation exercise, promising to deal with those responsible \u201cin the strongest way\u201d but claiming her \u201coverriding memory will not be of them but of a fitting farewell to the Boleyn\u201d. Clearly Sullivan\u2019s son Dave Jr hadn\u2019t got the memo, though. Asked by one Twitter user whether his father regretted his comments, the 18-year-old, who has previously been in hot water for criticising then-club captain Kevin Nolan, replied: \u201cNot at all, I agree with him. If Manchester United had been on time/early there would have been no issues.\u201d By blaming United\u2019s tardiness for the escalation of events and refusing to condemn his own supporters, Sullivan left himself wide open to criticism. Even his apology, published on the club\u2019s website at 11.51am on Wednesday (nearly 15 hours later), appeared half-hearted. \u201cIf we were to have scripted how our final game at the Boleyn would have played out, it wouldn\u2019t have been much different to last night\u2019s match,\u201d he began. Really? You can understand West Ham\u2019s delight at coming back from a 2-1 deficit to beat United as they attempt to secure European football for next season but were the scenes before kick-off how the club wants their last match in E13 to be remembered?     West Ham\u2019s co-chairman David Sullivan has now backtracked on his accusation that Manchester United\u2019s team bus was not damaged and vowed to ban those responsible. Photograph: Paul Gilham/Getty Images    Sullivan did go on to apologise to United but he is well known for being an owner who shoots from the hip. The Cardiff-born son of an RAF serviceman who made his first million selling soft-pornography photographs by mail order, the 67-year-old said this season he would be taking a vow of silence after stating that the then QPR striker Charlie Austin had \u201cno ligaments in his knee\u201d during an interview with a West Ham supporters\u2019 group podcast. Legal action from Austin\u2019s camp was only avoided after a public apology, although in February Sullivan went on to allege that a physiotherapist had been sacked after assuring him that the club\u2019s record signing Andy Carroll would be fit for the start of the season. The mitigating circumstances are that Sullivan was upset at the prospect of the \u00a3250,000 post-match celebrations which had been organised by the club being placed in jeopardy by the decision to delay kick-off. However, that and the fact that he is said to take every West Ham defeat harder than any fan does not excuse such ill-judged comments. The publication of his apology \u2013 described by the club as \u201ca message from David Sullivan\u201d \u2013 indicates there was pressure on him to backtrack before any further damage was done. Now estimated to be worth around \u00a31bn despite having served 71 days in prison in 1982 for living off immoral earnings, Sullivan is rumoured to be ready to entertain selling West Ham once they are settled in at the Olympic Stadium. That could provide a last, highly lucrative windfall for a man who has no compunction about how he has made his fortune. \u201cIf I was selling guns or cigarettes, I might have doubts about what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Sullivan said in an interview with Essex Life magazine in 2010. \u201cBut adults appear in these magazines and adults buy them, and I believe that as long as you don\u2019t hurt anybody or commit a criminal act, adults should be able to do what they like with their lives. I can\u2019t see a problem.\u201d Once more, it appears that Sullivan is in denial.",
