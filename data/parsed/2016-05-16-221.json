  "body": "The first teaser trailer for Danny Boyle\u2019s long awaited sequel to cult smash Trainspotting has been released, though it doesn\u2019t reveal any new footage. Instead, the 45-second promo offers a reminder of the joys of the original 1996 movie, soundtracked with Iggy Pop\u2019s evergreen Lust for Life, to mark the start of shooting. Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are back as Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie for Danny Boyle\u2019s sequel. Apparently titled T2, with apologies to James Cameron\u2019s dystopian sci-fi sequel, the film is expected to be loosely based on Irvine Welsh\u2019s 2002 novel Porno, the Scottish author\u2019s followup to his 1993 tale of Edinburgh heroin addicts.     Director Danny Boyle and actor Ewan Bremner shooting Trainspotting 2 Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images    The book tells the story of Renton\u2019s return to Scotland after several years as a nightclub owner in Amsterdam, having ripped off his former associates Sick Boy, Begbie and (to a lesser extent) Spud following the quartet\u2019s drug deal in Trainspotting. It sees Sick Boy, Spud and Renton embarking on a pornography venture as the latter does his best to stay out of Begbie\u2019s way and avoid a violent confrontation. Trainspotting screenwriter John Hodge is also back for the sequel, which is expected to arrive in cinemas in January next year.  While the trailer may not offer much in the way of footage, Coming Soon has posted some photos of the returning cast in character for those who just can\u2019t wait to see what Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and Begbie look like 20 years on.",
