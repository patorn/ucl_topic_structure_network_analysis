  "body": "Among the poetry racks on the second floor of San Francisco\u2019s legendary City Lights bookstore, an audience member is confronting the author Jarett Kobek with a spirited defense of the revolutionary power of Twitter and Bernie Sanders. His harangue, delivered during a book reading in February, was in atavistic beatnik dialect. \u201cI do Tweet about it, Jack!\u201d he shouted, stirring an erstwhile polite audience to shout things like \u201cSit the fuck down!\u201d and \u201cLet him talk!\u201d  It\u2019s hard to imagine a more appropriate reception for Kobek\u2019s second novel, I Hate the Internet, a savage satire of internet culture set in 2013 San Francisco.. It centers on the fallout from a surreptitious recording posted to Youtube, its narrator describing real-world events of the city rendered in the hyperbolic language that has come to represent online interactions, and diverging into off-topic invective to expose its \u201c intolerable bullshit\u201d.  More funny than obnoxious, the novel has become a sleeper sensation \u2013 a more or less self-published book that landed a favorable review above the fold on the front page of the New York Times\u2019 arts section (something Kobek believes is a first for a self-published book). It has dipped into the Amazon top 500, and appears set for a wider international release in six languages.     The City Lights Bookstore in North Beach, San Francisco. Photograph: Alamy    San Francisco\u2019s independent bookstores, pinched for years by online competition and soaring commercial rents pushed up by the city\u2019s tech boom, have pushed the book hard. \u201cWith this cover, I think the book would have sold OK even if the pages were blank,\u201d says Kobek. It\u2019s easily spotted on the city\u2019s buses and in its parks, wielded as a talisman against the epidemic of smartphones. But the reception has exceeded his rosiest expectations. \u201cThe ironic thing, of course, is that this has all mostly happened on the internet,\u201d said Kobek, 38, of his book\u2019s unlikely success. His shaved head is glinting in the afternoon light of a dingy cafe in San Francisco\u2019s North Beach. He points to a photograph of American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis reading his book in bed, and a mention on music site Pitchfork as catalysts for the book\u2019s surge in sales. Sales on Amazon, both digital and paperback, and attention from the New York Times are laden with irony. The novel describes them respectively as \u201can unprofitable website dedicated to the destruction of the publishing industry,\u201d and \u201ctransitioning from America\u2019s paper of record into a website that catered to the perceived whims of affluent, youthful demographics.\u201d  Over the course of the novel, its author gradually reveals an ambivalence towards the internet belied by its stark title. Early on Kobek writes: \u201cThis bad novel, which is a morality tale about the internet, was written on a computer. You are suffering the moral outrage of a hypocritical writer who has profited from the spoils of slavery.\u201d Later, during a long mountain-top soliloquy by a semi-autobiographical character, a scene which openly parodies the climax of Ayn Rand\u2019s libertarian novel Atlas Shrugged, the reader learns: \u201cI know what the internet was like before people used it to make money. I am the only literary writer in America with a serious tech background! I am the only literary writer in America who ran Slackware 1.0 on his 386x!\u201d Kobek admits that his experiences both using technology and working for tech firms have been formative . \u201cThe internet is as much a part of me as anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve done just about every low-level, high-paying job the internet has to offer, from web design to systems admin. I was a big Unix guy at one point, in my late teens.  \u201cBut my relationship with it started divorcing around the time social media started. Really the book could be called \u2018I hate four companies and social media\u2019 \u2013 but that is a bad title.\u201d     A street car moves past Twitter Inc headquarters in San Francisco, California. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images    What the book taps, says Kobek, is a visceral emotional impulse he encountered frequently on his just-concluded national book tour, its ranting tone and merciless humor attempting to offset a feeling of powerlessness commonly felt by internet users The book defines this as \u201cintellectual feudalism produced by technological innovation arriving in the disguise of culture\u201d. Kobek blazes with brutal rhetoric, but described the narrator\u2019s desperate attempt to understand an impossibly complex and fluid situation. \u201cI knew people hated the internet,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t realize how deeply wounded people are by it. Everyone knows someone who\u2019s had just horrible experiences. It\u2019s been exhausting, at times it has felt like group therapy,\u201d he said of his recent book tour . Kobek lived in San Francisco from 2009 through 2014 before decamping to Los Angeles. \u201cThe preparation was, unfortunately, being tortured by San Francisco for four years,\u201d says Kobek . \u201cWhen I come back now, I just feel overwhelmingly sad. As much as I shit on it, San Francisco has enormous charm. But it\u2019s like a city with Alzheimer\u2019s, it still looks the same but there is something missing.\u201d     \u2018The merit of any moment in San Francisco could be measured by a simple question: was the beauty of the city outweighing its annoying citizens?\u2019 Photograph: Alamy    He writes of the city with wrath. \u201cSan Francisco had two distinctions: One, it was the most beautiful city in America. Two, it was filled with the most annoying people in America. It had always been like this, from the beginning. The merit of any moment in San Francisco could be measured by a simple question: was the beauty of the city outweighing its annoying citizens?\u201d  But the success of Kobek\u2019s bleak book is a story of hope and entrepreneurial pluck. Stymied in his early attempts to get it published, he co-founded a small press in Los Angeles called We Heard You Like Books, designing the cover and writing the Kindle and Nook files himself. He even created a prequel in the form of \u201can agitprop video game\u201d cassette for beloved British microcomputer the ZX Spectrum. The book will be released in the UK this fall by Serpent\u2019s Tail, and in Germany by Fischer Verlag. His next book, which takes up with the same characters during in an earlier era in New York City, has been sold to Viking. In I Hate the Internet, Kobek identifies with the tragic experience of comic book artist Jack Kirby, who created Captain America and many other superheroes but never financially benefitted from the business that he helped build. \u201cThe internet, and the multinational conglomerates which rule it, have reduced everyone to the worst possible fate. We have become nothing more than comic book artists, churning out content for enormous monoliths that refuse to pay us the value of our work.\u201d With this novel, Kobek seems to have found a way to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen to him \u201cAs long as you have something to sell,\u201d he says, \u201cthey can\u2019t really hurt you.\u201d",
