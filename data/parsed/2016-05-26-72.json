  "body": "This week we want your musical recommendations with unusual or extraordinary vocals. Maybe the voice is extraordinary or distinctive to begin with, or a particular vocal performance is out-of-this-world? Either way, and however you interpret what the word \u2018extraordinary\u2019 constitutes \u2013 pick your tune and make your suggestions now.   Related: Janis: Little Girl Blue \u2013 a heartfelt account of a remarkable talent    You can find a list of all songs previously picked and so ineligible for the series here. You have until 11pm on Monday 30 May to post your nomination and make your justification. A regular RR contributor (this week, Sheila Deane, who posts below the line as thoughtballoons and who set this week\u2019s topic) will then select a playlist from your recommendations. If you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions \u2013 and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian \u2013 please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line \u2018RR guru\u2019 or make yourself known in the comments. Here\u2019s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:  Tell us why it\u2019s a worthy contender. Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song\u2019s words. Provide a link to the song. We prefer YouTube, but Spotify or Soundcloud are fine. Listen to others people\u2019s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist. If you have a good theme, or if you\u2019d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com. There\u2019s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \u201czedded\u201d, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of \u201czedded\u201d (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), \u201cdonds\u201d and other strange words used by RR regulars. Many RR regulars also congregate at the \u2019Spill blog.",
