Even though it is quite weird that Percy Jackson does not appear like the Romans and has his own distinct ways of fighting (like Greeks), he is accepted by the camp. While entering he aids Juno (or Hera) and carries her to the camp and meets his friend Frank and Hazel in this journey. The three demigods set out on a mission to free the god of death however during this time, Gaya is trying to manipulate Percy\u2019s mind and attempts to use him as a pawn.         Will Percy Jackson along with his friends succeed on this mission? Will Gaya be able to manipulate Percy\u2019s brain? Will the roman campers accept Percy? There are millions of questions that remain unanswered. It is a must-read book and perfect to take you into a marvellous journey.
