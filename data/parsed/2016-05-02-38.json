  "body": "A little-noticed part of Labor\u2019s climate policy could push up retail power prices by between 8% and 25%, economist Danny Price has claimed, with price hikes in Victoria exceeding the impact of the former Labor government\u2019s carbon tax. Price, who helped devise the Coalition\u2019s climate policy, told Guardian Australia last week the main plank of Labor\u2019s policy \u2013 a new style electricity emissions trading scheme \u2013 was exactly what he designed for Malcolm Turnbull in 2009 and mirrored what the Coalition\u2019s Direct Action plan would almost certainly have to become to meet Australia\u2019s greenhouse targets. He said the price rises under that scheme would be \u201cminimal\u201d for many years.   Related: Labor proposes two emissions trading schemes costing $355.9m    But Price has now modelled a second plank of Labor\u2019s policy \u2013 a scheme under which big brown-coal generators, near the end of their operational life, would submit bids for how much money they would need to receive to shut straight away and deal with the community and employment fallout. The cost of the winning bid would be paid for by all the other generators in the market, who would enjoy higher prices because of their competitor\u2019s closure. The academics who first proposed the idea, Frank Jotzo and Salim Mazouz, estimated it could cause a one-off rise of between 1% and 2% in retail power bills, while recent modelling by analysis company Reputex found the impact could be even lower \u2013 between 0.2% and 1.3% \u2013 or that perhaps there would be no price rise at all. \u201cFor residential electricity bills, falling network costs may completely offset any cost impact of the new policy, with retail energy prices expected to fall out to 2020,\u201d said Bret Harper, associate director of research at Reputex. \u201cThe closure of a large coal generator is likely to have a negligible impact on residential electricity bills.\u201d But according to Price, in a brief to clients of his firm Frontier Economics, that did not \u201cring true\u201d and he modelled the example of Hazelwood, a brown coal-fired power station that produces over 20% of Victoria\u2019s electricity and produces 3% of Australia\u2019s greenhouse emissions, suddenly closing down under the scheme in July 2017.   Related: Why Coalition climate scare campaign is not credible and makes no sense    He found this could cause a short term price shock adding up to 25% to retail prices in Victoria, falling to between 14% and 15% in a few years as investments in other energy sources came on line. In New South Wales and South Australia, connected with Victoria in the east coast electricity market, the retail price increases would be an initial 13% or 14% falling to 8% or 9% over time, he said. Despite Price\u2019s praise for sections of his policy, Labor\u2019s climate spokesman Mark Butler said Price \u201chelped Tony Abbott write his Direct Action policy\u201d and \u201cregularly rails against our policies to expand renewable energy, so I\u2019m not surprised that he is again campaigning against our Climate Change Action Plan\u201d. \u201cLabor has responded to overwhelming calls in the electricity industry for government to adopt an orderly framework around the transition from Australia\u2019s heavy reliance on coal fired power to modern, clean energy. Mr Price\u2019s opinion is directly at odds with modelling from the ANU and energy analysis firm, Reputex. That modelling supports electricity industry projections that average household power bills will decline in real terms over the period to 2020,\u201d Butler said. Jotzo, an associate professor at the Crawford School of public policy, and Mazouz, a principal at the Centre for International Economics consultancy, responded to the substance of Price\u2019s claims. \u201cThe key point is that without effective carbon pricing, an exit mechanism of some form is needed for an orderly transition from old coal-fired power stations to renewables. There is a broad consensus about this in the policy community and in industry. Danny Price attacks our proposal for how this could be achieved but does not offer any solutions,\u201d they said.   Related: Business council praises Labor's 'bridge' to emissions trading scheme    Jotzo pointed out that their plan included \u201ca safety valve in case the costs turn out unacceptably high. As we state in our paper, government would not need to go ahead with the closure scheme if the bids in the reverse auction were judged too high. And as Frontier point out, high expected price impacts would be visible through high payments demanded for exit, so the government would know what to expect.\u201d And Mazouz said the Frontier modelling \u201cassumes that the market is taken by surprise by the sudden retirement of an entire plant\u201d. \u201cThis would not be so. The market would know the schedule for plant retirement, and indeed a plant could be phased out gradually by retiring the several units that a power station consists of one at a time. Our proposal is all about orderly transition, and any policy mechanism can be designed to be gradual and fully predictable,\u201d he said. Price last week said \u201cthe emissions intensity part of Labor\u2019s plan appears to be exactly what we were proposing for Malcolm Turnbull and Nick Xenophon in 2009\u201d. Price modelled the scheme for Turnbull and Xenophon when Turnbull was the opposition leader and considering his response to the then Labor government\u2019s cap and trade ETS. Turnbull lauded it as a \u201ccheaper, greener, smarter scheme\u201d and said it could deliver deeper cuts to greenhouse emissions but impose far lower increases in electricity prices. But the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, dismissed it as a \u201cmagic pudding\u201d.  Price said the new Labor policy was \u201ca bit light on detail but it looks pretty much the same [as the Turnbull 2009 plan]. Malcolm Turnbull thought it was a good idea then. I\u2019m delighted the Labor party is proposing it now.\u201d   Related: Direct Action 'safeguards' will allow industry to increase emissions \u2013 analysts    Price \u2013 who the government recently appointed to the Climate Change Authority and who acted as an adviser on Direct Action \u2013 said the Coalition would probably have to move to a similar scheme itself in order to meet its own emissions reduction targets. \u201cThe government\u2019s Direct Action plan \u2013 its safeguard mechanism \u2013 could be modified to create exactly this same type of scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that was the most likely way for them to go after the review they have scheduled for 2017, because they are obviously going to have to make changes to meet even their existing targets and this is a low-cost way to do it. \u201cIt is actually emerging as an idea with the potential to be adopted by both major parties.\u201d Under Direct Action the \u201csafeguards mechanism\u201d is supposed to ensure increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government\u2019s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions. At the moment the baselines are lenient, ensuring industries don\u2019t \u201cgo rogue\u201d but not seeking to reduce their greenhouse emissions. But many observers, including business groups, expect they will have to be tightened after 2017 to gradually reduce industrial emissions. And that would turn Direct Action into much the same scheme as Labor is proposing.",
