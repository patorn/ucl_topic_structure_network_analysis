  "body": "\u201cOh gosh, someone\u2019s had an accident there,\u201d says actor Naomie Harris, sounding concerned. She\u2019s in a car en route to the Dior show at Paris fashion week; such invitations have tumbled in since she played Winnie Mandela in 2013\u2019s Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom and updated Eve Moneypenny in the Bond films Skyfall and Spectre. Harris, 39, began acting professionally aged nine, and after university (Cambridge) and drama school (Bristol Old Vic) she was cast by Danny Boyle in the dystopian 28 Days Later. Her new movie is Our Kind of Traitor, an adaptation of the John le Carr\u00e9 novel, in which she and Ewan McGregor are an ordinary couple caught up with the Russian mafia while on holiday in Marrakech. Is going to fashion shows fun or professional obligation?I love fashion and I have a great stylist who introduced me to it, because I didn\u2019t know anything about fashion before. Now we go every year to these shows and it\u2019s just a fun thing to do. But it\u2019s just for the red carpet, not everyday\u00a0life. With Our Kind of Traitor \u2013 and the BBC\u2019s recent The Night Manager \u2013 are we seeing Le Carr\u00e9 being adapted in more opulent, glamorous style?I\u2019d say Our Kind of Traitor has got the real Le Carr\u00e9 feel to it, but maybe a difference would be the emphasis on the romantic relationship. It\u2019s a spy thriller and all of that, but at the heart of it, it\u2019s about love and family and you don\u2019t generally see that at the centre of Le Carr\u00e9 films. It used to be that Le Carr\u00e9 heroes were the cynical, anti-James Bonds. As someone who has worked on film versions of both, do you think they are coming closer\u00a0together?If anything, Bond is moving closer to Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s world in that, with Daniel [Craig] playing Bond, it\u2019s become much grittier and less fantastical. So yeah, there\u2019s some movement but they are still fundamentally going to be very\u00a0different.         Watch the trailer for Our Kind of Traitor    With two regular people at the centre of Our Kind of Traitor, it encourages the audience to think what we might do if, say, a kingpin money launderer for the Russian mafia asked for our help. How did you answer that personally?Oh, I\u2019d react incredibly badly. I\u2019m such a scaredy-cat, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be going on any of those adventures. I\u2019d be like my character, Gail, not wanting to go. That she goes along with it is solely because of her depth of love for Perry [McGregor] \u2013 and I don\u2019t think I would be brave enough to do that for anyone.    A woman who waits around for a man, pines after them\u2026 I don\u2019t have any experience of that kind of woman  Naomie Harris     Our Kind of Traitor is directed by Susanna White, who made Generation Kill, Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang and the BBC\u2019s Jane Eyre. Is it a different experience being directed by a woman in an action film like this one?It\u2019s not really a different experience \u2013 as in, if you have a great director then they have great sensitivity and understand how to speak to you to get you into a specific emotional state. The difference in having a female director \u2013 and also Gail Egan as a producer \u2013 is just a sense of reassurance on set. So often when you\u2019re on a film set, you do feel isolated, because you\u2019re often the only woman. I\u2019m so used to it that I just accept it, but there\u2019s some part of it that\u2019s alienating, and when you have an experience like working with Susanna and Gail, it makes you feel much more part of the process than you normally do. You feel like you belong a lot more. You famously asked for press material to refer to \u201cBond woman\u201d not \u201cBond girl\u201d \u2013 do you specifically seek out strong female\u00a0roles?I\u2019m not interested in playing roles that stereotype me as a woman or as a black woman. I grew up with incredibly strong, powerful women around me who were highly intelligent and doing their own thing, and those are the women I\u2019m interested in portraying because that\u2019s what I know to be the truth. A woman who waits around for a man, pines after them\u2026 I don\u2019t have any experience of that kind of woman, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be very good at playing that kind of character. You landed the Moneypenny part after Sam Mendes saw you on stage in Danny Boyle\u2019s Frankenstein. But is it true that you don\u2019t find theatre acting wholly\u00a0enjoyable?I\u2019m not a theatre animal. It\u2019s not my thing at all. I went to the Bristol Old Vic theatre school, so I\u2019ve trained to be a theatre actor, but in every performance\u00a0I felt like I was going to throw up. I don\u2019t think that level of nerves is particularly healthy. I suppose the challenge is to channel those nerves into energy, excitement and things that help your performance, but I didn\u2019t manage to find a way to do\u00a0that.     Harris alongside Idris Elba in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Photograph: Pathe/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    You played the role for a few months \u2013 it didn\u2019t get better?It didn\u2019t get easier at all; every night was the same. Like Groundhog Day. Arrgh! Can you do anything to overcome nerves?I do something called EFT, which is emotional freedom technique, otherwise known as tapping, which really helps me. Is that where you use your fingers to stimulate acupuncture points?Yes, so I\u2019ll do that before a first day of filming. And if there\u2019s a particularly tricky scene I\u2019m worried about, I\u2019ll do it before then as well.   Related: Film Weekly podcast: Jason Solomons meets Naomie Harris    Will anything positive come out of the #OscarsSoWhite debate about the Academy Awards\u2019 lack of diversity?I hope it does, because I wanted the debate to be more focused on solutions rather than venting about where we\u2019re at. The stats speak for themselves \u2013 the Oscars voters are 94% white, 76% male \u2013 so it just seems right, fair and inevitable that there should be some kind of change in the voting system. But if you just say, \u201cThis is unfair, we\u2019re going to boycott it,\u201d it doesn\u2019t force people into action. However, if you show the injustice of the system and say, \u201cLook, here\u2019s a way forward\u201d, it makes it more difficult for people to\u00a0ignore. Idris Elba, your co-star in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, complained recently that there\u2019s no British equivalent of the American Dream, and that\u2019s why he left to find more interesting work in the US. Would you agree with that?I understand what he\u2019s talking about with the American Dream: the notion that you can achieve anything. And I love the can-do mentality, in LA especially, the hunger. But there are negative sides to that as well, because I don\u2019t think this insatiable appetite for success at all costs is particularly healthy or balanced. And I think there\u2019s a fallacy in the dream, in that success doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to happiness. The things that you want aren\u2019t necessarily the things that are best for you. So I agree with him in some ways and in some ways not. As someone who was raised in a single-parent household in Finsbury Park, London, and went to state schools, are you surprised by the middle-class dominance of acting?It doesn\u2019t surprise me in the sense that it\u2019s an expensive profession to enter if you want to train, because now there aren\u2019t really the grants. So everybody has got to raise their own money to get to drama school, which is a huge hurdle if you don\u2019t have parents who have got money. And if you don\u2019t have any financial support and back-up it\u2019s a very scary profession, because there are always these huge intervals when you\u2019re not earning. That\u2019s just the nature of the business.     Harris with Jonny Lee Miller in Danny Boyle\u2019s Frankenstein at the National Theatre in 2011: \u2018In every performance I felt like I was going to throw up.\u2019 Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    Has that been difficult for you personally?I was very lucky because I started earning at nine and I saved all my income so that when I turned 18 and needed to go to university, it was all there. I always had a really strong work ethic. I didn\u2019t need to rely on anybody else financially and I couldn\u2019t anyway \u2013 that was never really an option \u2013 but I had a strong belief in myself that I could do it on my own. And that\u2019s what got me through. You wrote a novel aged 13 \u2013 what was the\u00a0plot?It was about a middle-class girl whose parents get taken ill and she has to go and live on a council estate with her aunt. It was about the escapades she gets into and the culture shock, being from a very middle-class background and ending up on a council estate.

How does it hold up?I did reread it about two or three years ago and I was really impressed! It\u2019s so dated, because I talk about cassette players and Walkmans, so if I ever try to rewrite it and bring it up to date, it would need quite a bit of work. But I was like, \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Then of course I shoved it back in a drawer. Is it true that you\u2019ve never drunk alcohol?Well, I\u2019ve had a sip of wine and I do love Bailey\u2019s at Christmas. The most girly drink possible. But other than that, no. I hate the taste and smell of it. What\u2019s the most useful and useless skill that you\u2019ve had to learn for a movie?Most useful: the physical training I had to do for Skyfall because it really kicked my butt and got me in shape. I\u2019m usually quite lazy about things like that but it\u2019s given me a lifelong healthy habit. The most useless was probably learning to scuba dive [for After the Sunset], because I absolutely hated it. I won\u2019t be doing that again in a hurry. Our Kind of Traitor is out 13 May",
