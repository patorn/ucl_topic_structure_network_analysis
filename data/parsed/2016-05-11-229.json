  "body": "The culture secretary, John Whittingdale, has pledged not to tamper with the list of \u201ccrown jewel\u201d sporting events, such as the Wimbledon tennis finals, Olympic Games and the football World Cup final \u2013 that must be broadcast free-to-air on services such as the BBC. Whittingdale, speaking at a business of sport conference organised by the Telegraph newspaper, said that the government would not look to either add or remove sports from the so-called crown jewels list. Any move to remove some of the sports from the list would almost certainly kill the chance of the BBC, ITV or Channel 4 holding on to them in the face of deep-pocketed pay-TV rivals such as Sky, Discovery and BT.   Related: BBC's demise is 'tempting prospect', jokes John Whittingdale    Any move to add more sports to the free-to-air protected list could anger some sports bodies who make significant sums from lucrative pay-TV deals, a factor that prompted cricket\u2019s governing body to leave free-to-air TV in favour of Sky. \u201cSky \u2013 and now as well BT \u2013 have generated huge sums for the sports they screen, while helping to grow and sustain interest and participation,\u201d said Whittingdale. \u201cWe do not propose to reopen discussion on listed sporting events. Rather than dictate to individual sports, I believe that it is better to allow national governing bodies and other rights-holders to decide for themselves the right balance between reaching a wide audience and generating as much revenue for their sport as they can.\u201d Whittingdale said the government\u2019s \u201cstarting point should always be how to ensure the broadest audience can experience live sport\u201d. With the BBC targeting its sports rights portfolio as a major area to make cost-savings, the corporation is already struggling to hold on to a number of the events on the protected free-to-air list.

ITV won the terrestrial rights to screen horse racing from Channel 4 next year.  The BBC still airs the Olympic Games after striking a deal to sub-license the rights from Discovery which paid \u00a3920m for the pan-European rights from 2018 onwards.

Alongside the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d is a designated B-list \u2013 which includes the Cricket World Cup, England test matches and golf\u2019s Ryder Cup \u2013 which only have the free-to-air rights protected for highlights. In 2009, an independent review of the list recommended that a number of events be added to the crown jewels list, such as Open Championship golf, the full Rugby World Cup and Ashes cricket. However, when the coalition government came to power in 2010, it delayed making changes, saying it would not make any decision on the future of listed events until after the conclusion of digital switchover. In its sports strategy published in 2015, the government said it did not intend to reopen discussion on listed events. The current list was compiled in June 1998 and is as follows: Crown Jewels: full live coverage protected for free-to-air TV \u2013 such as BBC \u2022 The Olympic and Paralympic Games  \u2022 The Fifa World Cup finals tournament  \u2022 The European Football Championship finals tournament  \u2022 The FA Cup final  \u2022 The Scottish FA Cup final (in Scotland)  \u2022 The Grand National  \u2022 The Derby  \u2022 The Wimbledon tennis finals  \u2022 The Rugby League Challenge Cup final  \u2022 The Rugby World Cup final Group B: Delayed highlights of coverage protected for free-to-air TV \u2022 Cricket Test matches played in England \u2022 Non-finals play in the Wimbledon tournament \u2022 All other matches in the Rugby World Cup finals \u2022 Six Nations rugby matches involving home countries \u2022 The Commonwealth Games \u2022 The World Athletics Championship \u2022 The Cricket World Cup, including the final, semi-finals and matches involving home nations\u2019 teams \u2022 The Ryder Cup  \u2022 The Open Championship",
