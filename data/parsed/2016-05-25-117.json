  "body": "More obese patients should be offered weight-loss surgery to make people healthier and save the NHS money, medical professionals have said. Writing in the British Medical Journal, bariatric surgeons say fewer than 1% of people who could benefit are getting surgery, and the numbers are falling rather than rising. They warn that the UK is lagging behind other countries in Europe, and argue that the procedures could help 2.6 million obese people in the UK. Have you had weight loss surgery, and if so, did it improve your health? Did you ask for the surgery, or were you referred for the operation by a doctor? Were you worried about the procedure, and did those concerns prove justified? What was the recovery period like afterwards, and how did the surgery change your life? Did it eliminate any issues with food and addiction, or did you find other unexpected issues emerged \u2013 physical or psychological? Share your stories and experiences using the form below.",
