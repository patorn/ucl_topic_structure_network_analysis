  "body": "They promised it would be the biggest party in Leicester\u2019s history \u2013 and it certainly lived up to expectation. Tens of thousands of fans filled the streets \u2013 and later the city\u2019s A&E unit \u2013 as they celebrated Leicester City\u2019s title-winning heroics in euphoric style. Ecstatic fans spilled out of pubs and danced in the street after Claudio Ranieri\u2019s underdogs were formally crowned Premier League champions in front of 32,000 fans following their 3-1 win against Everton at their King Power stadium on Saturday night. The raucous celebrations continued well into the next day, prompting the Leicester Royal Infirmary to warn that it was treating twice as many patients as normal \u2013 mostly people who had suffered alcohol-related mishaps.

Photograph: Jim Powell for the Guardian    On Sunday morning, the emergency services were clearly feeling the repercussions of the fans\u2019 title-winning excess. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS trust posted on its official Twitter account:    @Leic_hospital is feeling the effect of the @LCFC game yesterday. If you don't need to come to A&E please don't. Call NHS111 for advice/care\u2014 Leicester Hospitals (@Leic_hospital) May 8, 2016    A spokeswoman for the trust confirmed that Leicester Royal Infirmary had been flooded with twice the usual number of patients as it urged non-emergencies to call the NHS 111 helpline instead. She added: \u201cLast night and this morning we have seen twice as many patients in our emergency department than we would normally on a Saturday night/Sunday morning. The majority are being treated for minor injuries or alcohol-related incidents. \u201cWe expected it to be incredibly busy this weekend and have the necessary plans in place to safely treat our patients. \u201cA plea is for those who do not need to come into A&E to call NHS 111 for healthcare advice.\u201d Buildings across the city were cloaked in blue and white on Saturday night, with lifesize images of Leicester players draped from streetlights as fans marched proudly through the centre, chanting: \u201cWe\u2019re all going on a European tour.\u201d Fireworks accompanied the roar that erupted around the stadium when the real trophy was presented to captain Wes Morgan after the 3-1 victory over Everton. The Blue Ink tattoo parlour, where striker Jamie Vardy spent seven hours being inked before watching the Chelsea-Tottenham match that confirmed Leicester\u2019s triumph, was operating at full throttle. \u201cI\u2019m having to charge my phone twice a day,\u201d said tattoo artist Nik Moss-Glennon, whose Instagram account has been deluged with requests. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been this busy.\u201d At Hogarth\u2019s gin bar, champagne glasses were raised and tears were shed as the Foxes lifted the trophy.   Related: Julian Barnes: my stupid Leicester City love    \u201cI\u2019ve been a Leicester fan since I was born,\u201d Jak Ward, 22, told the Leicester Mercury. \u201cWords can\u2019t express what this means to me. It\u2019s a dream come true. \u201cIt\u2019s been a turbulent season. They\u2019re made of steel. The spirit they\u2019ve shown has been amazing \u2013 the fans, the players, the manager. Everyone. I never, ever, ever, ever thought I\u2019d see this moment. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Sheree Dewey, 44, passed glasses of fizz to strangers as well as friends as she explained her love for the city. \u201cLeicester was always a city that people hadn\u2019t heard of,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, everyone\u2019s heard of Leicester. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have grown up here and to have lived to see this. When they escaped relegation last season, I thought that was bloody brilliant. Now this \u2026 I just can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t wait for the parade.\u201d The joyous celebrations came as the club confirmed details of its victory parade through the city on Monday 16 May. An open-top bus carrying Leicester players will snake through the city\u2019s streets, from Jubilee Square to Victoria Park. The squad will then appear on stage at Victoria Park alongside other entertainment as the celebrations are beamed out on big screens across the city.",
