  "body": "Government claims that Labor has a $200bn budget black hole over 10 years are partly based on aspirational statements that are not Labor policy, such as restoring $19bn of foreign aid cuts, Mathias Cormann has revealed. But Labor has copped criticism for claiming the government\u2019s $48bn company tax cuts over 10 years are unfunded, while Labor includes the money as revenue available for its own spending plans.  Cormann told Radio National on Tuesday the $200bn black hole claim \u2013 or $66bn over four years \u2013 included \u201ca range of savings the government has banked, where various shadow ministers have said they won\u2019t be proceeding with them, although that is where there is a level of argument\u201d.   Related: Australian Tax Office to review deduction that lets MPs 'double dip'    Asked whether that included the claim that Labor would restore $19bn in foreign aid cuts, Cormann said it was included because in July Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, had said \u201cwe certainly wouldn\u2019t continue with the aid cuts that are scheduled by this government\u201d. Plibersek had clarified it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to restore the funding in the short term but Labor hoped to do so in the long term. On Saturday Labor promised to reverse a $224m cut to foreign aid in the 2016 budget but did not commit to restore $19bn in foreign aid over 10 years, as the government\u2019s \u201cblack hole\u201d claims have implied. Cormann denied it was misleading to include the aid figure. \u201cThey want to have it both ways: they want to say they are committed to restoring the foreign aid to 0.5% of gross national income; at the same time, nudge nudge wink wink, they don\u2019t want it reflected in budget bottom line,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe Coalition is committed to affordable and sustainable foreign aid funding ... Labor has made some outlandish promise that are not affordable \u2013 if they are no longer committed to restoring all of the funding that we\u2019ve cut, they\u2019ve got to say so.\u201d   Related: Today's campaign: calls for 'the old Malcolm' mount, putting pressure on Turnbull    Asked at a doorstop what portion of the alleged $66bn black hole was for actual Labor policies, Cormann said it consisted of $30bn of Labor\u2019s promises costed with their own numbers and \u201c$35bn worth of savings that we have banked where Labor in one way or another has said you must restore that spending\u201d. \u201cIf Tanya Plibersek wants to come out today and say they\u2019re no longer committed to restoring the funding cuts, that\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll adjust the numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Australian people deserve clarity. They deserve to know what the numbers actually are.\u201d Cormann said the black hole claims included $18.1bn over four years of savings measures that Labor opposes and are blocked by the Senate.  \u201cThese numbers are black and white,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially every promise Labor has made so far, about $30bn of promises so far, are all unfunded, which means Labor can\u2019t deliver them.\u201d On Tuesday the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said: \u201cThe biggest hit to the budget has been the government\u2019s reluctantly costed and completely unfunded $48bn tax cut for corporations. \u201cWe won\u2019t take any pious lectures from a government which has at the centrepiece of its budget a tax cut which it wouldn\u2019t tell Australian people how much it would cost ... and is completely unfunded.\u201d Asked whether it was hypocritical of Labor to claim the $48bn company tax cuts over 10 years were unfunded while proposing to spend the saving, Bowen responded: \u201cIt\u2019s a measure we won\u2019t proceed with. \u201cWhen our fiscal bottom lines are compared in this election \u2013 [the government] will have that [$48bn company tax] black hole and we\u2019ll have our spending and savings commitments, we\u2019ve taken a fiscally responsible approach.\u201d   Related: Coalition, Labor and Greens urged to halve homelessness in next decade    The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, targeted Labor over its spending at a media conference at Angelsea, in Victoria, where he announced $60m to address mobile phone black spots. \u201cThe real issue is the flagrant wastefulness and recklessness of the Labor party outspending us by 20 to one in this campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cBillion-dollar Bill keeping on joking, making jokes about the spend-o-meter. He thinks it\u2019s a joke spending all our taxes, that\u2019s what Bill thinks, another billion here, another billion there.\u201d Turnbull said the government\u2019s black hole claims were based on \u201cthe things that [Labor] have blocked, the measures of ours they have denounced and said should be reversed and of course the promises they\u2019ve made. \u201cIf the Labor party disagrees with any of these points, then they should correct them.\u201d",
