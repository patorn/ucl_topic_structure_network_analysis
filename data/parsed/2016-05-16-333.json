  "body": "Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End PS4, Sony, cert: 16\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 In a medium where a sense of spectacle is taken as a given, Uncharted 4 raises the bar to a new level. Naughty Dog\u2019s exquisitely pretty game takes unhurried players on a 15-hour-long journey, leading them through jungle into tombs over sun-baked isles. It might be seen, then, as conventional adventuring fare in the tradition of Lara\u00a0Croft. But the latest voyage for everyman protagonist Nathan Drake proves thematic familiarity and high quality are\u00a0not mutually exclusive. Here,\u00a0every moment is delivered with such craft and\u00a0care, and every set piece\u00a0so precisely\u00a0considered, the result\u00a0is a benchmark game for the PlayStation 4, assisted by outstanding performances from the cast. Uncharted 4\u2019s gunplay is refined and reliable, the writing as engrossing as the series has seen, and the cinematographic delivery utterly beguiling, as Drake chases down the myth of a pirate Shangri-la. Put simply, it is a game that looks, sounds and plays like one of the finest titles of this console generation. WF     Fire Emblem Fates: finely tuned strategic gameplay.    Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright/Conquest 3DS, Nintendo, cert: 12 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Making the best of a popular and successful franchise, what is ostensibly the 14th game in the Fire Emblem series\u00a0is actually made up of three separate titles. The first two are Birthright and Conquest (the third, Revelation, is due in\u00a0June), which open the same way but change completely when the hero chooses which warring family to side with. Those familiar with Fire Emblem will\u00a0know what to expect from Birthright and Conquest. They\u2019re turn-based strategy RPGs, with handsome anime visuals and addictive gameplay. Players must develop relationships between the characters while keeping them alive in order to improve the chances of victory on the battlefield. Birthright is the beginners\u2019 game, a little easier, but lacking the variety and depth of the darker Conquest. Admittedly, neither game offers much that is new, and the tutorial is convoluted, but the finely tuned strategic gameplay, beautiful soundtrack and compelling narrative make these a welcome pair of 3DS classics. CD         Watch a trailer for Battleborn.    Battleborn PS4, Xbox One, PC, 2K Games, cert: 16\u2605\u2605\u2605 Even if developer Gearbox\u2019s name were absent from Battleborn, its pedigree as a product of the makers of Borderlands would be clear. From the simple but satisfying shooting mechanics to character progression that unlocks abilities, the two bear similarities so striking, it\u2019s hard to believe it is not a direct spin-off. At the end of the universe, the few survivors huddle around the last remaining star to squabble over dwindling resources. The threadbare story serves mainly to justify wildly divergent characters \u2013 25 in total, all from different species and boasting unique skills. The meat of the game is in its multiplayer mode. Battleborn is, however, servant to too many masters. Gameplay ranges from conventional team shooter to multiplayer online battle arena, with elements of tower defence and loose strategy. A nice twist is that all characters revert to level one for each match, allowing you to explore new abilities each time, but no single aspect is evolved enough to please devoted fans of the many genres it attempts to balance.
