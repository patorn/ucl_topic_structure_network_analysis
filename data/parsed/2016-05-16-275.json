  "body": "It was another dismal showing for the UK but Eurovision performed rather better for BBC1, with more than 7 million viewers, bouncing back from last year\u2019s five-year ratings low. The annual song contest, this time graced by the presence of Justin Timberlake (not in competition, as they say at the Cannes film festival) had an average of 7.1 million viewers on BBC1 from 7pm on Saturday, with a five-minute peak of 8.5 million. It was up on last year, when an average of just 6.6 million viewers tuned in, but not as high as 2014, when it was watched by 8.8 million people, or 2011 when it drew 9.5 million viewers. BBC1\u2019s Eurovision lost out to Simon Cowell\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent on ITV which had 7.8 million viewers, a 37.2% share, also from 8pm. When the two were head to head, Eurovision had 5.7 million viewers. But Eurovision was on substantially longer, finally coming to a close after around three and a half hours, against Britain\u2019s Got Talent which wrapped up at 9.20pm.
