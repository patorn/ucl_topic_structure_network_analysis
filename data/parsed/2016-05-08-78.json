  "body": "Fifteen years ago I took an idea for a new documentary series to Channel 4 hoping they would give me a chance. I\u2019d had some early success with three series of Naked Chef on the BBC but I felt it was time for a new challenge. I wanted to push myself and I needed a broadcaster that would challenge me. That\u2019s where C4 came in. I went to them asking whether they would take a punt on a documentary series where there was only a small chance of a successful result. To be honest, they pushed me more than I was expecting because they wanted authentic, warts-and-all television and not just \u201cthe Naked Chef opens a restaurant\u201d. They were absolutely right to do that, and I truly don\u2019t think I would be the man I am now had it not been for that key decision. And that, to me, is the C4 way: brave, risk-taking, demanding \u2013 but also nurturing, dynamic and caring. It\u2019s been 15 years since we started filming Jamie\u2019s Kitchen, which led to the Fifteen restaurant in London and we\u2019re all still here \u2013 me, C4 and Fifteen \u2013 all doing well, all still shaking things up, all taking risks and reaping the rewards. C4 is now almost 35 years old, but to me it still maintains that edginess it had on day one. And, of course, we\u2019ve made series and specials that have launched campaigns and changed government policy. Together, Channel 4 and I have created real change.  Channel 4 is a terrific platform for reaching millions of smart, well-informed and vocal viewers. Its people are not afraid to take risks and as a result they get a lot of flak \u2013 and so do I \u2013 for some of the programmes we make together. But they keep the faith in me and I keep the faith in them, whether it\u2019s for a series on endangered fish species or the crazy thing we make with Jimmy Doherty on the end of Southend Pier, Friday Night Feasts. Channel 4 is as comfortable being playful as it is being provocative.  Most importantly, I guess that for the past 15 years it\u2019s felt like home. The people at Channel 4 have been nurturing, encouraging, caring, and when I say \u201cpeople\u201d, I mean everyone from the top down. Yes we\u2019ve had the odd disagreement \u2013 that happens in every home \u2013 but we\u2019ve always come out of them stronger, and that\u2019s the sign of a great relationship. Thanks for caring, Channel 4.
