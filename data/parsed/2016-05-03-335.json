But it was immediately revised by the Lords and sent back \u2013 to be voted on in the Commons again next week. Dubs says the new amendment, which states that numbers of child refugees will be determined by the government in consultation with councils, has made it \u201ceasier for the government to accept\u201d, but the key principle, that Britain should take in unaccompanied, mostly Syrian minors from Europe, remains in place. The government has argued that the UK is already helping refugees in the Middle East, and that accepting vulnerable children from European camps would create a \u201cpull factor\u201d. But Dubs, who arrived in the UK from Czechoslovakia on Kindertransport aged six, disagrees. \u201cThere is little evidence to suggest that, but in any case the plight of unaccompanied children in various parts of Europe is so serious that one has to set that off against the possibility that one or two might come as a result of a magnet effect,\u201d he says. This isn\u2019t the first time Dubs has worked on migration issues \u2013 he chaired the Refugee Council for seven years and worked on immigration while on the Labour shadow cabinet front benches during the late 1970s and early 1980s. But he believes that public support for his amendment is significant at a time when resentment and negative sentiment has been stirred around the issue of refugees and migrants across Europe.    The British have good humanitarian instincts. People feel that if we can do something to help, we should    \u201cIt seems to have got hope to people, that it\u2019s something we could easily do as a country and is important to do,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cBritish people have good humanitarian instincts. Basically people feel that it\u2019s a rough world, and if we can do something to help a few people, then we should do that.\u201d A Labour working peer since 1994, the Prague-born Dubs says that he is fighting this case on principle, but in terms of garnering media attention his background has obviously helped. He arrived in Britain in 1939, one of 10,000 children who the UK received as part of the government-backed Kindertransport scheme from Germany and Nazi-occupied countries before the outbreak of the second world war. Dubs was one of the youngest children and also, he says, luckier than most, because both his parents survived the war: his father was already in Belsize Park, north London, and his mother also eventually escaped \u2013 he is not sure how \u2013 and joined them in Britain. His father died of a heart attack shortly afterwards, leaving her alone with a child and no money, scrubbing floors and travelling the country for various jobs. She died of leukaemia just after Dubs finished university at the London School of Economics. Years later, he learned that he was one of the 669 children saved from the Nazi regime by Sir Nicholas Winton \u2013 the \u201cBritish Schindler\u201d \u2013 and the two became friends. Dubs says that, steeped in politics at an early age, he quickly realised he wanted to enter this field, because \u201cif evil politicians had caused so much that was dreadful in the world, maybe politics could also be used for good\u201d. Always aligned to the Labour party \u2013 \u201cthe only way forward\u201d \u2013 he was selected as Labour candidate for Battersea South, which he represented until 1987, a post he describes as \u201ca privilege\u201d. There followed a short period\u00a0out of work \u2013 he went to sign on for the dole after losing his seat and wrote \u201cnot enough votes\u201d on the form as the reason for his unemployment. After writing a book on how to lobby parliament, to help campaigners and activists, he worked for the Refugee Council, becoming the first refugee director of the organisation, and later for Liberty, as well as other charities and trusts. It seems that Dubs has always been a thorn in the side of governments, during Labour tenures too. In 2008, while Gordon Brown was prime minister, Dubs refused to approve the government\u2019s attempts to increase the period of detention without charge, from 28 to 42 days. \u201cThe whips asked me four times if I\u2019d support the government and I said no. Then they asked me if I\u2019d take the day off and I said no.\u201d He opposed the Iraq war, though he says that, to this day, he regrets not moving a Lords amendment that declined to support military action in Iraq without endorsement from the UN security council. It wouldn\u2019t have passed, he says, but still: \u201cThere was a point of principle about it and a time when it was important to go on the record. I would have felt more at peace with myself if I had played my part\u201d In the Lords he has fought, among many other things, to make mental health trusts more open, to provide more support for neurological diseases \u2013 his son has MS \u2013 and in favour of assisted dying. He wants to see an income tax increase hypothecated to the underfunded health service \u2013 something he feels the public would support if they knew every penny of the increase was going to the NHS. He has also been consistently vocal on race relations \u2013 during the Brixton riots of the early 1980s he \u201cgot into long arguments\u201d about police stop and search, which was disproportionately targeting young black men and which he views as one of the factors causing \u201cunderstandable resentment\u201d. Still clearly passionate in opposing discrimination of any sort, and at a time when the Labour party has been under fire over antisemitism, Dubs says: \u201cI think antisemitism, Islamophobia and racism are all absolutely and equally abhorrent,\u201d adding: \u201cIf I thought the Labour party had a problem with antisemitism, I would leave tomorrow.\u201d He does, however, feel that party leader Jeremy Corbyn began to address the issue \u201ctoo slowly, and didn\u2019t make a clear enough statement\u201d about it early on. As for the government, he thinks the current administration is \u201charsher than the Thatcher government in some ways \u2013 the cuts in our services are awful, the cuts in social security support, all these things are a terrible package, where the poor are having to carry the burden\u201d. He was pushing to tackle tax avoidance long before the Panama Papers and still believes this is key \u2013 along with opposing austerity measures. The unfairness in our society is much more manifest. How can we have a world with such wealth inequality? It is scandalous \u2013 and I shall go on playing my part, to lessen inequality, to work for equality, to oppose discrimination of any sort and to have decent public services.\u201d As the new amendment on unaccompanied child refugees goes back to the Commons, he remains hopeful that MPs will do the right thing. \u201cBritain is a great country, but I don\u2019t think we are doing a good enough job,\u201d he says. \u201cI keep saying, I\u2019d like other people to have the same opportunities in Britain that I had.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age 83.
