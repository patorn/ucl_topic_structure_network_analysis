  "body": "Conservatives have never really courted Mike Sani, the founder of mass youth voter movement Bite the Ballot, with his campaign often finding itself at odds with David Cameron. But things have changed recently. Last year, the prime minister was the only one of five party leaders to drop out of the Leaders Live debates aimed at the youth vote, hosted by Bite the Ballot before the general election. Yet three weeks before the voter registration deadline for the European Union referendum, Sani got the call from Downing Street, meeting the Cameron with a delegation from Google, Facebook, Twitter and Buzzfeed.  Young voters, twice as likely to vote to remain as to vote to leave, are suddenly the voters Cameron needs. As good as it is now to have the prime minister on board, Sani said he was worried it had all come too late.    Brexit explained: Conservatives   \u201cTo be going into No 10, to talk about how you increase voter registration at this stage, it\u2019s like \u2018are you kidding me?\u2019 But you gotta go,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have put the referendum on the same day as Glastonbury? Has it been thought through? Probably not. But that\u2019s always the way when people are making decisions and not thinking outside their own community. I\u2019m sure they have reasons why it\u2019s on that day, but it feels a bit rushed.\u201d Bite the Ballot, which has a staff of 12, will now push for 500,000 new registrations before the 7 June deadline for the EU referendum, in a campaign called #TurnUp in collaboration with Hope Not Hate, an anti-fascist group which has turned its attention to wider civic engagement.  Hope Not Hate\u2019s director Nick Lowles said he had realised that the feelings of alienation that led to the rise of fascist groups were still present despite the demise of the British National party. \u201cPart of the alienation is the feeling that the political process doesn\u2019t support them and now we want to say to people, you can change things, you can punish your MP or your councillor if they aren\u2019t doing stuff that you like,\u201d Lowles said. \u201cI think that\u2019s empowerment; you don\u2019t have to go down the extremist route.\u201d Before starting Bite the Ballot six years ago, Sani, 33, was a business studies teacher in a Dartford comprehensive school. \u201cMy boss turned up to work one day and asked me, three weeks before the general election, \u2018have you decided who you\u2019re going to vote for?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t vote. Politics doesn\u2019t affect my life\u2019.   Related: Are you aged 18-35? How will you vote in the EU referendum?    \u201cAnd he just shot me down, he couldn\u2019t believe it: \u2018You drove here today and politics affects your petrol prices, if your nightclub can have a late licence.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t really believe I\u2019d got to the age of 27 and I didn\u2019t really know this, and I\u2019d worked in two educational establishments and no one is teaching the next generation this.\u201d Sani said he was not driven by a political ideology but by the fundamental inequality of young people being excluded from the political debate. \u201cKnowledge is power, and some people are educated about how the country is run and some people are not,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people are just seen as consumers, not citizens. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people even know what a political ideology is. Why should they? You don\u2019t just automatically pick this stuff up. It\u2019s a typical British blame culture of how it\u2019s your fault if you don\u2019t know.\u201d Bite the Ballot began as a lunchtime club for Sani\u2019s students but he decided after a year to quit teaching and devote himself to the cause full time.  In 2012, the group held its first voter registration rally at the Ministry of Sound for the London mayoral elections and it created the UK\u2019s first national voter registration day in 2014. On the first anniversary of the drive, three months before the UK general election, almost half a million people registered over the course of a week.  It was a world record, the most successful registration drive in any western democracy per capita, and the group\u2019s achievement was hailed by Barack Obama in his address to 500 young leaders in London last month. Sani said he believed Bite the Ballot was seen as more of a nuisance than a help before the referendum and relations were at a low ebb after Cameron pulled out of the Leaders Live debate.  \u201cThey dragged it along and along, and we had an email chain for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then they pulled the plug and said they wouldn\u2019t do it, nine months after. All of us involved, everyone said \u2018we need to say that that\u2019s not on\u2019. So we launched this social media attack.\u201d That response, he says now, was probably \u201ctoo emotional\u201d and Sani said he had learned to adapt his behaviour now the campaign had the ear of government. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change it but it was a learning curve for us,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because we are small, we are not afraid to spotlight when things are not done right.  \u201cI think in the lifecycle of Bite the Ballot, there have been times we\u2019ve just been very vocal, but then there have to be times where you check in with yourself and think, \u2018right, OK, people are listening now, let\u2019s evolve\u2019.\u201d The blame was not entirely with politicians and educators for low voter turnout, Sani said. Young people who want to fight for issues that matter to this generation, such as better mental health care, opposing university fees or de-colonising their curriculums, have to take their fight to the polling booth, too.  \u201cThis is an active generation, speaking out particularly on issues like mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people do have to know that the world doesn\u2019t owe it to them if they don\u2019t step up. \u201cMy point would be to students: you\u2019re not registered in enough numbers to be taken seriously. Time was spent organising rallies, not enough on making sure every single student was registered to vote. Why did fees come in? It came down to the fact politicians knew students wouldn\u2019t punish them at the ballot box.\u201d Once the registration deadline is passed, Sani and Lowles both want to turn their attention to education. \u201c[Education secretary] Nicky Morgan came out and said very recently how important it was for young people to vote and get involved and use your rights. And it\u2019s like, \u2018yeah, well done\u2019.  \u201cNicky Morgan has actually got the power to ensure they do. Change the education system. Let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s a good, engaging political education for everyone, rather than just allowing politics to be done to them.\u201d",
