Sunelia also has 15 spa destinations, such as Le Clos Du Rh\u00f4ne, in the Camargue regional nature park, with a wildlife sanctuary and herds of bulls and white horses, as well as Mediterranean beaches. Up in the mountains, the kids can go wild at the Les Trois Vall\u00e9es site in the Pyrenees \u2013 10 minutes from Lourdes \u2013 where the many outdoor activities include everything from caving to paragliding as well as the campsite has a 2,000-square-metre waterpark.\u2022 sunelia.com Les Castels     Les Castels\u2019 Ch\u00e2teau de Boisson, near Montpellier. Photograph: Peter Allan    Founded in 1959, Les Castels brings together beautiful sites and estates across France, with 38 to choose from. The smart four- and five-star sites offer different styles of accommodation: chalets, treehouses, gypsy caravans \u2013 or apartments, for those who prefer to enjoy the great outdoors from a more solid base \u2013 in a choice of seaside, mountains and the countryside settings. Many of the sites \u2013 which have a sustainable environmental approach \u2013 are situated around grand chateaux. These include the 15th-century Ch\u00e2teau de Boisson, which is just inland from Montpellier and has its own swimming pools, workshops and entertainment for children and is an excellent base for hiking, climbing and canoeing.\u2022 camping-castels.co.uk Sandaya     Aerial view of Sandaya\u2019s new campsite, Douce Qui\u00e9tude. Photograph: Peter Allan    Most of Sandaya\u2019s 11 sites are along the Mediterranean coast, though it also offers locations in Normandy, Brittany and Aquitaine. This year the company celebrates its fifth anniversary and has three new campsites, including Douce Qui\u00e9tude on the French Riviera, a leafy site with pool and waterpark and also a good base for exploring towns such as Saint-Tropez and Cannes. Another new campsite is Blue Bayou in Valras, in the Languedoc region, right on the coast and nearby seaside resort Valras-Plage, which has more than four kilometres of beach which is perfect for hiking and watersports. Accommodation ranges from mobile homes with private hot tubs to six-person bungalows. \u2022 sandaya.co.uk Riviera Villages     One of Riviera Villages\u2019 three holiday camps in Saint-Tropez    If you\u2019re looking for a holiday camp with a little more than the usual family fun park aesthetic, Riviera Villages has accommodation in wooden lodges among exotic gardens, with palm trees and plants adding to an easy-going, tropical feel. The \u201cTiki Lounge\u201d, for example, has a private terrace with small pool and wooden decking area, and three bedrooms. The three holiday resorts are all in the gulf of Saint-Tropez, and all on the beachfront. While offering a fun, family ambience, with plenty of sports and activities, these should also appeal to those after a more peaceful, adult-focused break.\u2022 riviera-villages.com Camp Atlantique     Les Peupliers campsite on \u00cele de R\u00e9    Camp Atlantique has six family campsites in France offering a range of accommodation \u2013 wooden chalets, eco-lodges, bungalows and gypsy caravans \u2013 all within walking distance of a beach. These include the Les Peupliers campsite on \u00cele de R\u00e9 on the Atlantic, and Le Boudigau, further south on the edge of Basque country. All sites have heated swimming pools, waterslides and facilities for playing games, from badminton to beach volleyball. \u2022 camp-atlantique.co.uk",
