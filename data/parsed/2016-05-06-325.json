  "body": "Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts? I recently took on a great role in the non-for-profit sector and I am being paid much more than my previous role in the corporate sector. The organisation itself is good and the little work I do, I enjoy. The problem is that I often don\u2019t have enough work and feel myself stretching out small tasks to fill in the hours of the day.   Related: Are these the world's most boring jobs? | Guardian readers and Sarah Marsh    The job role was only recently created, so it is difficult to see what comes under my remit. I\u2019ve been there a few months now and although I have offered to take on tasks from other teams/departments, I often feel like I\u2019m treading on other\u2019s toes. More importantly, doing a bit of everything means that I don\u2019t often feel valued. I\u2019m simply trying to fill my time finding things to do. I have tried in the past to speak to my boss to see whether there are extra responsibilities I can take on, with no result. In fact, it often seems he hasn\u2019t got enough to do himself and is often complaining of his own boredom. As someone used to busy offices and fast-paced roles, having very little to do is ruining my self-confidence and I\u2019m not sure what to do next. There are obviously aspects of the job I like so I\u2019m reticent to leave, but I hate the boredom and worry I\u2019ll get found out. Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy\u2019s and readers\u2019 help, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com. Please note that he is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or to reply personally.",
