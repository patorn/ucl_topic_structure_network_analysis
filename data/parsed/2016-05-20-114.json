  "body": "Common Ground takes Rob Cowen back to Bilton, Yorkshire, where he grew up in the 1980s, and to the edge-lands \u2013 those areas between town and country where as a child he experienced moments of \u201ccondensed wildness\u201d, such as a grass snake slithering past his\u00a0foot. It is to this liminal space that he returns as a father-to-be, aware that a new phase of his life is beginning. His\u00a0journey to the edge-lands is also a journey within: \u201cin seeking to unlock, discover and make sense of a place, I\u00a0was invariably doing the same to myself\u201d. In this space where human lives meet the wildness and unpredictability of nature, Cowen reconnects to\u00a0a forgotten yet vital landscape. Rediscovering the area around his home alters his \u201cinternal landscape\u201d. In\u00a0this memoir of transformation, he writes evocatively of the power of these overlooked spaces, his poetic prose turning them into sites of mystery and rebirth. And yet he acknowledges that just as his own life is about to change, this precious world is also \u201cdoomed\u201d, destined to be built on. \u2022 To order Common Ground for \u00a36.29 (RRP \u00a38.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
