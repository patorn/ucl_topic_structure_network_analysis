  "body": "In January I went on the Argos website and ordered a washing machine and TV, entering my debit card details. It stated it would take five days to deliver. But when I rang customer services a man told me it does not accept debit cards, contrary to what it says on the website. Then when I received my bank statement in February I noted that a payment of \u00a3286 was taken from my debit account by Argos, but I still haven\u2019t received any goods. How do I retrieve my money? Argos seems to be lax in its customer services and even emails do not seem to make any impact. I\u2019d be very grateful for your help. PB, London W6 This is the latest in a swelling postbag about Argos\u2019s poor customer service and puzzlingly contradictory advice. It follows a recent complaint published on these pages about the delivery of the wrong mattress and a refund made on the purchaser\u2019s credit card. Not only did the refund not materialise, but was actually made to another purchaser\u2019s debit card. After we intervened the reader was offered a \u00a375 gift voucher as a goodwill gesture. Regarding your complaint, you decided not to proceed with the purchase and we have been reassured by Argos that the \u201cmatter has been resolved and a full refund issued\u201d. We recommend the company improves its customer service as a matter of urgency before it loses any more shoppers. Argos has been credited with leading the way in the digital transformation of UK retailing; let\u2019s hope its new owner, Sainsbury\u2019s, gets to the bottom of what appears to be going wrong.
