  "body": "It was the day Senate Republicans were \u201cempty-chaired\u201d eight times over. A mock confirmation hearing for Merrick Garland, the president\u2019s nominee for the supreme court, had a lopsided appearance as eight Senate Democrats took their places but not one of their political opponents showed up. But if the hour-long stunt was aimed at embarrassing Republicans into finally holding a real hearing for Garland, who has been in limbo for 63 days, that party\u2019s response suggests they are likely to be disappointed.  Democrat Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate judiciary committee, chaired the meeting in a packed room on Capitol Hill and called on four witnesses to testify about Garland and the consequences of not filling the supreme court vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. Garland himself was not present. Former judge Timothy Lewis, who was appointed to the US court of appeals for the third circuit by President George H W Bush, testified that his confirmation in October 1992 by a Democratically-controlled Senate made him \u201cliving proof\u201d that a Senate controlled by one party can confirm an opposing party\u2019s nominee to an appellate court in a presidential election year. Lewis powerfully contrasted Monday\u2019s supreme court non-decision to return a high-profile dispute over access to birth control to lower courts with the landmark 1954 Brown v Board of Education ruling that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. He worried that, split between four conservatives and four liberals, today\u2019s court would have tripped up on Brown v Board of Education, leaving different rules in place in different parts of the country. \u201cThink about the implications for the nation if that case on Monday was Brown versus Board of Education,\u201d he told the half-panel. \u201cThink about that. As an African American and as someone who is, and has always been, committed to issues of social justice and civil rights, I can\u2019t help but think about that and I can\u2019t help but think about it in the context of other cases that are bound to come up through the court during this period. \u201cThese are matters that should be of critical importance to all of us on both sides of the aisle. The future really is at stake \u2026 elections matter. The duly elected president of the United States has nominated a highly qualified person to a position of great importance. That matters. Not the future president; this president, with almost a year left, nominated Merrick Garland to this position. Elections matter, decisions matter.\u201d Lewis, from Pennsylvania, warned that the supreme court is at risk of being marginalised. \u201cI join you in wishing some of your colleagues from across the aisle were here today to understand this and to hear this. There are real consequences affecting real people. Some of these are matters of life and death.\u201d He pointed to the case of Duane Buck, a death row inmate in Texas, whose sentence was \u201cbased on testimony that he posed a future danger because he was black\u201d. It has been challenged by a petition but deferred because of the court\u2019s hamstrung state. \u201cThis is the fifth consecutive week that the court has not acted.\u201d Senate Republicans have refused to hold a vote, or even a hearing, on Garland\u2019s nomination, saying the choice should be left to Obama\u2019s successor.  Lewis described Garland as a nominee \u201cstraight out of central casting\u201d and urged the Senate to put the constitution ahead of partisan politics. \u201cToday we are mired in a very unfortunate and dysfunctional place that is resulting in what is going on now with respect to a wonderful judge, a highly qualified nominee and, incidentally, a terrific human being, Merrick Garland,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here because I refuse to accept that and I think the country should refuse to accept it too. I believe that it is the responsibility of the United States Senate, just as it is the responsibility of citizens of this country, to rise above these petty self-interests and to act with honour and with decency.\u201d He added: \u201cI am also here because I believe the United States supreme court should never be viewed as a political arm, an ideological arm of any political party. I detest, as a former federal judge and as an American citizen, seeing that occur today. I believe that the supreme court must remain above the fray because it is a symbol of our greatest aspirations as a society and I believe that we have to do whatever we can.\u201d The Democratic senators also heard from Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School and former law clerk to Garland, which he described as an \u201cinvaluable experience\u201d. Driver continued: \u201cIt was, without question, the most formative single year of my entire career. As has been well documented by now, Judge Garland possesses an unbelievable sharp analytical mind. He works very long hours in order to make sure that his cases come out in the right way. He is, many people have said, a judge\u2019s judge.\u201d He warned: \u201cThe failure to confirm Chief Judge Garland\u2019s nomination to the supreme court would represent not only a grave injustice for this particular nominee but may also, I fear, portend catastrophic consequences for our constitutional order.\u201d Driver said Garland stands by his clerks in good times and bad and, in one of several lighter moments, revealed: \u201cJudge Garland had incisive views about Adam Levine\u2019s vocal stylings and Maroon 5 ... The reason of course is he would drive his daughters to school and at least periodically would allow them to commandeer the car\u2019s audio system.\u201d Donna Bucella, who worked with Garland in the Justice Department on the Oklahoma City bombing case in 1995, said she admired his ability to take charge of the investigation. \u201cMerrick is calm under pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never really know what\u2019s going on in his head. He\u2019s always 25 steps ahead of everybody else.\u201d As even the Democratic members slipped away, leaving yet more chairs unfilled, the proceedings wound down after an hour. Leahy acknowledged: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not a hearing, it\u2019s obviously not a substitute for a hearing with Judge Garland.\u201d He added: \u201cI get frustrated when I hear these lobbying groups go on attacks against him because he can\u2019t respond to those.\u201d In a real confirmation hearing, Leahy remarked, \u201cHe\u2019d swat them down.\u201d But Democratic complaints that the court is not merely deadlocked but diminished, with grave implications for the nation, appeared to fall on deaf ears. Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, dismissed the \u201cpretend hearing\u201d during remarks on the Senate floor. He said: \u201cSenate Democrats initially invited a witness who, at the beginning of the Bush administration, wrote this: \u2018The Senate should not act on any supreme court vacancies that might occur until after the next presidential election.\u2019 He also wrote that this would be \u2018a responsible exercise of the Senate\u2019s constitutional power\u2019. Apparently that witness is no longer available. Interesting.  \u201cThe would-be witness is Abner Mikva, a former Democratic congressman, federal judge, and White House counsel. He wrote these words in the second year of President George W Bush\u2019s first term. It was not, like the situation today, in the eighth year of a term-limited president. Democrats certainly have a complicated history when it comes to their own words and the supreme court.\u201d",
