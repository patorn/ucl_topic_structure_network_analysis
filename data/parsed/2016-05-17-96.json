  "body": "A man accused of murdering his six-year-old daughter in a fit of rage has described freezing in shock the moment he found her collapsed on the floor of her bedroom, and expressed regret for not phoning an ambulance until some hours later. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move, I couldn\u2019t breathe properly,\u201d Ben Butler told a jury at the Old Bailey. \u201cI didn\u2019t help the way I should have helped. I tried to help, I tried to shake her. She didn\u2019t wake, she didn\u2019t respond to what I did. I tried to breathe in her mouth, it didn\u2019t work. It just took the wind of my sails. I still don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t do more.\u201d  Butler, 36, who denies killing his daughter Ellie, said he should have called an ambulance when he could not revive her, but he collapsed on the floor himself. Giving his own account for the first time of the day his daughter was found with what a pathologist has said were \u201ccatastrophic\u201d head injuries of a type typically seen after a high-speed crash, Butler said he panicked when he found Ellie unconscious and he lay down on the floor. Later he called his partner, Jennie Gray, and asked her to come home. Jurors have previously heard that an ambulance was called at 2.45pm on 28 October 2013, two hours after Butler called Gray demanding she return home from work. \u201cI should have told Jennie, she would have told me to call the ambulance,\u201d Butler said. The jury heard that Butler had planned a \u201clazy\u201d day with his daughter that Monday and was due to go shopping for a Halloween costume. That morning, he said, he gave Ellie a jam sandwich, sweets and crisps and left her in her room while he went back to bed. At 11.30am he woke up, did some housework and then called up to Ellie and another child in the house offering them cake, he said. When he received no reply, he called again and then went upstairs, the jury heard. His daughter\u2019s bedroom door was shut. Butler said he opened the door quickly and at first saw the other child sitting on the sofa. \u201cThen I looked down and there was Ellie on the floor,\u201d he said, describing how her feet were pointing towards a wardrobe. He said he took the other child to another room. Asked by his barrister, Icah Peart QC, what he did next, Butler replied: \u201cI walked out the door \u2026 and shut the door behind me.\u201d Asked whether he had asked the other child what had happened, Butler said he had not. \u201cThe only way I can describe it is if you have a car accident \u2013 everything went slow. I felt like all the wind had come out of me and I went downstairs and I lay on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cI was crying, it took me a while to get up off the floor. I tried desperately hard to erase that memory, so it\u2019s not easy for me.\u201d At some point, he said, he contacted Gray and told her her needed her to come home immediately, though he did not say why.  \u201cCan you remember what she said?\u201d Peart asked.  \u201cShe didn\u2019t know until she came home there was anything wrong,\u201d the defendant said. The court heard that Butler then rang a friend, Ian Hudson, whom he had phoned in 2007 when Ellie had fallen ill with what was originally thought to be shaken baby syndrome. Butler was jailed for assaulting her, but his conviction was overturned in 2010. Butler said he did not tell his friend what had happened. Instead they had a brief conversation about a bank account. Butler said he put a towel stained with some of Gray\u2019s blood and some other items including a diary of hers in the bin because he sensed he would be blamed by police because of the previous overturned conviction for assaulting Ellie Earlier, he described the prosecution team as the \u201cchuckle brothers\u201d and said they had concocted the charges of murder and child cruelty. He said fractures found on Ellie\u2019s head had been caused while she was in foster care, at her grandfather\u2019s or when she was in the care of the local authority. He told the jury that Ellie was a \u201cunique\u201d baby who had been damaged at birth. He said an untreated broken shoulder discovered in the postmortem was not something he knew about. She had fallen over the family dog and was concussed but her arm was not in pain, he said. He did not seek medical treatment because after recovering from initial concussion she appeared to improve.  Butler and Gray both deny child cruelty over the shoulder injury. He said he was shocked when he was arrested. \u201cNo one actually knew what was wrong then,\u201d he said, \u201cand the postmortem didn\u2019t know what was wrong for four months, but the decision was made to arrest me that night, they [Sutton police] jumped, they thought they had won the lottery\u201d. Asked what he thought of medical expert opinion that he either hit Ellie with an object or hit her head against the wall, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s just bullshit. I\u2019m not guilty of murder, I\u2019m not guilty of manslaughter. I\u2019m not accepting things that I haven\u2019t done. I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d He said his biggest mistake was not calling an ambulance, and that one mistake had multiplied into a personal catastrophe. \u201cI realised I hadn\u2019t been watching the [children]. I had been asleep. I didn\u2019t call the ambulance for ages. One mistake leads to the next thing. Panicking, you\u2019re not doing the right thing, [this] leads to more problems. I should have told Jennie, she would have told me to call the ambulance, I just didn\u2019t.\u201d Before finishing his examination of his client, Peart asked: \u201cDid you kill Ellie Butler?\u201d Butler replied: \u201cAbsolutely not, 100% not.\u201d \u201cDid you strike her any way?\u201d Peart asked.  \u201cThere\u2019s no mark, there\u2019s no noise in the house, there\u2019s no marks on Ellie that look inflicted \u2013 there\u2019s a small bruise. I am not guilty of murder or manslaughter. I didn\u2019t cause that injury,\u201d Butler said. He told jurors: \u201cThe biggest mistake we ever made was trying to cover up what we did wrong.\u201d  Under cross-examination prosecutor Ed Brown, QC, accused Butler of being \u201ccalculating\u201d, a liar, and a violent man who would do or say anything to save his own skin. He answered \u201cno\u201d to each assertion. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mind Ellie lying dead somewhere in that house, so long as it gave you time to cover up your terrible crimes,\u201d Brown said to Butler.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d he replied. Butler reminded the jury that he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice when he had a conviction for assaulting Ellie when she was seven weeks old overturned. He repeated that he didn\u2019t want to call the ambulance because he knew he would be wrongly framed, given his two-and-a-half-year battle to get Ellie out of foster care following his successful appeal. \u201cYou fucking destroyed our fucking lives,\u201d Butler said. \u201cNot you personally, people we should trust had destroyed our lives. You fucked us for five, six years, [so] by the way let\u2019s trust you,\u201d he said rhetorically. Gray, 36, has admitted perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.",
