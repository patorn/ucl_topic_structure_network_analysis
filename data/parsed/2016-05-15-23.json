  "body": "The clay that Andy Murray once viewed with suspicion has become his friend and, a week before the French Open, a straight\u2011sets win against the best player in the world, Novak Djokovic, was sweet indeed. Had he not beaten Djokovic in his first Rome Masters final on Sunday \u2013 6-3, 6-3, with crisp, powerful groundstrokes from deep and artful work near the net \u2013 he knows the questions about the Serb\u2019s dominance over him would have invaded every conversation between now and Roland Garros, where he lost a tight semi\u2011final against the world No1 last year.   Related: Andy Murray beats Novak Djokovic to win Rome Masters claycourt title    Murray could take quiet comfort also from only his second success in 14 matches since beating Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final, because he kept his cool while the normally contained Serb came close to combustion on a surface they rightly considered hazardous. The Argentinian chair umpire, Damian Steiner, would not budge, however, when, with Murray two games from victory, Djokovic gave vent to his frustrations on the changeover, begging Steiner to suspend play to clean up a court that had been steadily drizzled on for most of the match. As Djokovic saw it: \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him to postpone the match. I asked to have a little break where we would give a little time, maybe five more minutes, to people to arrange the court. The chair umpire knew that the forecast was good. There was not going to be any rain. I didn\u2019t see any reason why we couldn\u2019t stop. \u201cWe played on a very, very heavy court because it was raining for an hour and it was very muddy behind the baseline. In three games I literally could have twisted my ankle two or three times. \u201cI asked him: \u2018Is it necessary that somebody gets injured?\u2019 [before] he realises what\u2019s going on? It\u2019s his decision whether or not the court is playable but to me it\u2019s ridiculous that [in] casual shoes he comes out and just slides on the line and says, \u2018OK, the court is good.\u2019 \u201cWe can laugh about it now but it\u2019s not just a matter of whether or not you\u2019re going to play better, win or lose. It\u2019s a matter of keeping yourself healthy. \u201cConditions like we had today \u2026 the risk for an injury is much higher than it [should] be. Behind the baseline especially, where we move the most, was heavy, muddy, very, very wet.\u201d Djokovic also exploded earlier in the second set. \u201cThese kind of matches are important for both players,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot at stake. When you play a rival, and of course you want to win, sometimes you get too emotional. \u201cI threw a racket, it bounced over the fence and I got a warning instantly. So the chair umpire was on fire today. He really wanted to show his authority to me. So congratulations to him.\u201d Murray, naturally, was not so wound up about all of this but he largely agreed with Djokovic. \u201cI didn\u2019t find it so much of a problem behind the baseline,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt was the lines that were the issue. They were extremely wet and you could see sometimes when the ball hits the line it just takes off. And it pretty much rained for a large portion of the match. \u201cIt is a difficult one because, if something was to happen to one of the players in that situation, either of us would be absolutely gutted and unhappy. If it was like at the beginning of the clay season maybe it would have been a bit different. But, with the French [Open] starting in one week, if you get a problem it can really hamper your preparations and your chances of winning there \u2013 so I can understand that.\u201d     Andy Murray celebrates victory over Novak Djokovic in Rome. Photograph: Pacific Press v/REX/Shutterstock    However, this was Murray\u2019s day to celebrate one of his finest wins, the first by a British men\u2019s player here since 1931, when George Patrick Hughes prevailed over the French legend, Henri Cochet, in a quick and decorous best-of-five final, a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 victory that presaged one of those extraordinary British droughts, the sporting counterpoint to our weather. The last overall British winner was Virginia Wade, who beat the then West German player Helga Niessen Masthoff 6-4, 6-4 in 1971. In a rainy, cloud-covered mist that would not have looked out of place in the Scottish Highlands Murray and Djokovic played the best of three but it surely was tougher and longer than that black-and-white moment. It lasted an hour and 35 minutes and must have seemed twice as long for Djokovic, who was carrying not only fatigue from a three-hour semi-final against Kei Nishikori the night before but a bruise on his left foot, self-inflicted towards the end of that match as he tried to loosen dirt from his shoe. It was not his weekend by any stretch. It was, however, Murray\u2019s 29th birthday. Next Sunday it will be Djokovic\u2019s 29th birthday. Since they were 11 they have been duelling and it has largely gone the Serb\u2019s way when it matters \u2013 apart from the two slam finals that Murray won, at Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows. How he would love to add the French to that collection, on a surface that was treacherous for both of them here on Sunday but might just be kind to the Scot in Paris.  This article was amended on 16 May 2016 to clarify that Murray\u2019s win was the first by a British player since 1971, when Virginia Wade won the women\u2019s final. It was the first win by a British man since George Patrick Hughes in 1931.",
