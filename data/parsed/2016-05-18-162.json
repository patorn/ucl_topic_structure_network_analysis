Related: Cannes 2016: Chloe Sevigny interview special - the Dailies film podcast    The actor, known for her work in independent films such as Kids and American Psycho, spoke to the Guardian about uncomfortable occasions during auditions for high profile directors. \u201cI did audition for some bigger directors who were more mainstream and they were creepy situations,\u201d she said. \u201cOne asked me, \u2018What are you doing after the audition?\u2019 which is just inappropriate, obviously knowing what he wanted. Another one wanted to bring me shopping and have me try on clothes.\u201d But according to Sevigny, the \u201cworst\u201d experience came when a director she wouldn\u2019t name talked at length about her body. \u201cI went in and I was dressed a little provocatively because I was dressing the part,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Oh you should show your body off more before you get too old \u2026 you should show it off now, you never show your body.\u2019 I\u2019m like, actually I\u2019ve been nude in almost every movie I\u2019ve done so I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re watching!\u201d  Sevigny\u2019s comments follow those of other female actors who have spoken out on the sexist treatment of women in the casting process. Last year, Maggie Gyllenhaal revealed she was turned down for a role opposite a 55-year-old actor as she was deemed too old at 37 to play his love interest. Rose McGowan also shared a casting call for an Adam Sandler movie where women were told to show off their cleavage. Sevigny believes it\u2019s important to have a \u201cstrong sense of self\u201d as a woman in the industry and to avoid falling prey to unwanted advances.

But she is also aware of the pitfalls that can await female directors. \u201cI think that male directors are often seen as mad geniuses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe behaviour that they\u2019re allowed to get away with is celebrated and it makes people think they are just even more talented because they exude these behaviours that are eccentric. Whereas when females do it, they get labelled as crazy and they don\u2019t work again. Why can\u2019t the woman be the mad genius as well? There\u2019s just not room for that right now unfortunately. Women get judged in such an unfair way.\u201d  Sevigny is also starring in the Jane Austen adaptation Love & Friendship with Kate Beckinsale and will next be seen with Richard Gere and Laura Linney in The Dinner.",
