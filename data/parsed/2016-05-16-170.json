  "body": "British Airways is considering ditching free food in economy class on short-haul flights in response to changing consumer habits \u2013 and even the free long-haul meal could be up for review. Passengers would instead have the option of paying for a better quality meal, the new BA chief executive, Alex Cruz, is considering. Cruz, who took over in April, was formerly at BA\u2019s codeshare partner Vueling, a Spanish budget carrier.   Related: IAG revises growth plan after Brussels attacks affect demand for flights    Charging for meals would remove one of the last onboard differences between BA and its budget rivals, but help the national carrier compete on fares. BA has already added charges for checking in bags, brought in under the guise of discounts for hand-luggage-only fares. The other airlines owned by BA\u2019s parent company IAG \u2013 Vueling, Iberia and Aer Lingus \u2013 already charge for food, and passengers on budget carriers have become accustomed to buying food from shops in airport departure lounges prior to boarding.  BA said reports of imminent meal charges, including a possible tie-in with suppliers such as Waitrose, were \u201cpure speculation\u201d. However, John Strickland, a leading airline consultant, said the move would be no surprise, and could save the airline unnecessary wastage as well as raising revenue. He said: \u201cIn business class, passengers are still getting a very nice product offer. But it\u2019s inconsistent in economy. People are used to going onboard loaded with food from shops at the moment because they don\u2019t know what to expect on BA \u2013 a full meal, or a wrap and a packet of crisps. BA is in a no-man\u2019s land at the moment. It needs to bring some clarity to better meet or manage customer expectations.\u201d Long-haul passengers may not be immune to the developments. A new \u201cenhanced meal\u201d option on long-haul flights has recently been introduced by BA, where passengers pre-pay for a menu of their choice.  Cruz\u2019s boss, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, recently told the Guardian that he was an admirer of low-cost, long-haul operator Norwegian, which charges transatlantic passengers \u00a328 for a pre-ordered meal service or \u00a310-11 for fresh food from the trolley. \u201cThere appears to be consumer acceptance of that ... that if you want a meal on a long-haul flight, you\u2019re going to have to pay for it. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d A BA spokesman said: \u201cWe are constantly reviewing every element of the experience our customers receive, including the in-flight catering, to ensure we\u2019re delivering what they want. Everything we do is with our customers in mind and we will make changes that reflect their feedback.\u201d",
