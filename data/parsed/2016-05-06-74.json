  "body": "North Korea has kicked off a once-in-a-generation congress in an attempt to confirm the absolute power of its leader, Kim Jong-un, and show unity before a possible nuclear test in the coming weeks. Speaking at the opening of the seventh Workers\u2019 party congress in Pyongyang, Kim hailed the \u201cgreat success\u201d of a nuclear test in January and launch of a satellite into space in February. Kim is the third in his family line to rule North Korea with an iron fist, and his speech will be closely analysed for signs of a change in attitude in the upper echelons of power.   Related: A history of North Korea's party congresses \u2013 what should we expect?    \u201cIn this year of the seventh party congress, the military and the people accomplished the great success in the first hydrogen bomb test and the launch of an Earth observation satellite, Kwangmyongsong-4, to brilliantly illuminate the prowess of Juche Joson,\u201d Kim said, referring to his country\u2019s homegrown founding ideology that combines Marxism and extreme nationalism.  Footage broadcast on North Korean state television showed him flanked by his top military aide and the head of state in a hall packed with military and party delegates. Human Rights Watch said before the speech that Kim was expected to \u201csolidify his power and formally announce his policies\u201d at the congress. \u201cKim Jong-un talks a lot about improving the lives of North Koreans, but we\u2019ll only know if he\u2019s serious if he takes action to end human rights abuses,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at HRW. \u201cBut I\u2019m not holding my breath waiting for that to happen.\u201d At the last congress, in October 1980, North Korea\u2019s then ruler, Kim Il-sung, elevated his son Kim Jong-il to number two in the party, cementing the family dynasty that has lasted to this day. At that time Margaret Thatcher was a year into her prime ministership, Jimmy Carter was US president and the Berlin Wall was nine years away from falling.   Related: Propaganda and the party congress: how to report from North Korea    Under Kim Jong-un, North Korea has embarked on a policy known as byungjin \u2013 developing nuclear weapons alongside the economy. Since 2011 the country has conduced two nuclear tests and two satellite launches \u2013 largely derided as thinly veiled ballistic missile tests \u2013 in defiance of international pressure.  However, the government has lost some control of the economy, and in recent years a black market has prevented further humanitarian crises on the scale of the 1994-98 famine. There is widespread speculation that a new nuclear test could take place during the congress, as a display of strength. Hours before the congress began, Pyongyang\u2019s committee for the peaceful reunification of Korea said: \u201cRegardless of whether someone recognises it or not, our status as a nuclear state that is armed with H-bombs cannot change.\u201d  It is unknown how long the congress will last. The previous event in 1980 ran for five days. Reuters contributed to this report.",
