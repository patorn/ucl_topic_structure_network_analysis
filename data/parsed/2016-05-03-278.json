  "body": "Nearly 3 million viewers watched a fully-clothed Gary Lineker celebrate Leicester City\u2019s Premier League title win on a special Monday night edition of BBC1\u2019s Match of the Day. Lineker, who promised to present the programme in his pants if Leicester won the league, was interviewed at home by presenter Dan Walker after Tottenham\u2019s failure to beat Chelsea saw them crowned champions.   Related: The Leicester Supremacy \u2013 a triumph that was never supposed to happen | Barney Ronay    Match of the Day was watched by 2.8 million viewers, a 27.1% share of the audience, from 10.55pm on Monday night, making it the most watched show across all channels. It had seven times the 400,000 viewers who saw Channel 4\u2019s Sex Box an hour earlier, from 10pm. \u201cI can\u2019t get my head round it, genuinely the biggest sporting shock,\u201d said Lineker last night. \u201cThis is actually impossible.\u201d Asked about his promise to present the first of next season\u2019s Match of the Day in his underwear - made before Christmas last year when a Leicester win still felt like an impossible dream - Lineker said: \u201cWe\u2019ll all have to wait and see won\u2019t we. \u201cI suppose I had better start thinking about it now hadn\u2019t I? If it means I have to wear pants doing Match of the Day then so be it, I suppose.\u201d Asked on Twitter if he would rise to the challenge, Lineker said he had another pressing concern about appearing nearly naked.     It's rising during the challenge that worries me. https://t.co/8n3dTLHIIK\u2014 Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) May 3, 2016",
