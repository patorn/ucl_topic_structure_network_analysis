  "body": "Walking into Martine Syms\u2019s first solo UK show, Fact & Trouble at the ICA, feels like walking into someone else\u2019s memories: a disconcerting mix of the familiar and the foreign.  Arrows point up a narrow, poorly lit stairwell which opens up into a bright white floor. In the small corridor that separates two rooms, enlarged pictures and video stills plaster the walls. These images are part of Syms\u2019s 2016 work, Misdirected Kiss, and appear in what seems to be no particular order; an imperfect tapestry of moments in other people\u2019s lives. Syms builds on this sense of voyeurism in the adjacent rooms. Two screens mounted back to back show snippets of home videos from her ongoing project Lessons (2014-), in a randomly ordered loop. I watch footage of a gospel choir, the video quality so bad I can\u2019t make out any faces, until it\u2019s suddenly replaced by another clip. Painted in large black letters on the three walls that surround the screens are the words: \u201cLightly, Slightly, Politely.\u201d     Imperfect tapesty ... Fact & Trouble at the ICA. Photograph: Mark Blower/ICA    The characters here are anonymous, save for a photograph of the actor and rapper Queen Latifah, and another of model Tyra Banks, posing with a pre-teen Syms. Syms\u2019 work considers what is to be a black woman, based on representations in film, text and photography: but Fact & Trouble makes no explicit attempt to create a narrative. As I crane my neck to see what lies behind one of her double-sided pictures, searching for meaning starts to feel as futile as trying to make sense of a hoarder\u2019s treasures \u2013 their aesthetic and symbolic appeal apparent only to the hoarder.    I don\u2019t think art is the most effective form of protest. I don\u2019t think it changes policy    And Syms does describe herself as a hoarder, of what she calls \u201corphaned media\u201d \u2013 old home videos and family photos. We meet just after her exhibition opens, at the west London hotel where she is staying. Tired, dishevelled and dressed in black, she is sitting at a booth in the restaurant, sipping on green juice. Given what I\u2019ve read about her \u2013 Syms calls herself a \u201cconceptual entrepreneur\u201d whose work covers themes as varied as \u201cAfrofuturism, queer theory, the power of language, and the spiritual nature of the colour purple\u201d \u2013 I am expecting to meet someone burdened by deep thoughts and artspeak.     Conceptual enterpreneur ... Martine Syms Photograph: Christopher Horne/ICA    Instead Syms, who looks younger than her 28 years, exudes southern California cool. She takes her time, pausing often, aware perhaps that her life and experiences will always be compared to the stereotype of what it means to be black in America. \u201cMy mum was very interested in art and liked to write, and my dad was a hobbyist photographer,\u201d she says of her upbringing (some of her father\u2019s photos are in the show). \u201cIt was a cultural household, but that wasn\u2019t a special thing \u2013 I feel like a lot of black families are like that. Being into music wasn\u2019t a thing. I don\u2019t even know if being into photography is anything special.\u201d This habitual exposure, and also her years as a graphic designer, explain why Syms isn\u2019t interested in what she calls \u201ca rarified type of art\u201d. Instead, she takes her work to where everyone is \u2013 the internet \u2013 and engages with different audiences through films, public lectures and publications.  \u201cPeople act like art is a white thing \u2013 or not for people of colour \u2013 when really so much culture and art comes from people of colour. I want everyone to get into what I am doing. So sometimes I don\u2019t like to work just in an art context because\u201d \u2013 she pauses for a long time then says, laughing \u2013 \u201cit feels like a lot of people aren\u2019t going to see it. I like it to be a part of everyday life. It is for me.\u201d Raised with three siblings in Altadena, an area north of Los Angeles (which in the early 1900s attracted millionaires from the east, many of whom left after the schools became desegregated in the 1960s and 70s), Syms was home-schooled for three years: \u201cThe area I grew up in didn\u2019t have the best public schools and it was hard to get all of us into the same private school \u2013 for a lot of racist reasons from what it sounds like.\u201d  Skipping grades when she did start school, Syms is influenced by ideas old and new. Misdirected Kiss derives its name from a 1904 film and both our conversation and her \u201cperformative lecture\u201d, later in the week, are peppered with references to African American intellectuals (Jacqueline Najuma Stewart, Arthur Jafa, Audre Lorde) and other cultural theorists such as Alison Landsberg. She appears more at ease examining and testing the work of these thinkers than immersing herself in the more ephemeral, attention-seeking world of pop culture. Even as pop icons such as Beyonc\u00e9 delve into politics and respond to protests such as the Black Lives Matter movement, Syms doesn\u2019t believe art can change the status quo for black people in America. \u201cI have said it before and I will continue to say that I don\u2019t think art is the most effective form of protest,\u201d Syms tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t think it changes policy, I think it changes discourse, and discourse can change ideas, and for me that\u2019s what it\u2019s about: having that space for conversation.\u201d         Martine Syms\u2019 Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto    And Syms wants to have that conversation, whether with art audiences at venues such as the ICA or the wider black cultural community, whom she targets in her Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto, a video essay first published in 2013 by the digital art organisation Rhizome. Afrofuturism has traditionally explored the black experience through science-fiction and is often seen as a means of escape from present-day hardships. But Syms puts forward the theory there\u2019s no happy-ever-after for the black person beyond the stars.   Related: Afrofuturism:  where space, pyramids and politics collide | Chardine Taylor-Stone    \u201cI was a black person using technology so in this one year I kept getting invited to all these Afrofuturist events,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I was not really feeling it. I thought some of the claims were just a little too self-serious. Around the time there was a noticeable increase in deaths from police brutality, and some of it just felt extremely strange. Senseless. I had already been thinking about that and responding to that.\u201d Drawing inspiration from writers Kodwo Eshun and Greg Tate, as well as Geoff Ryman\u2019s mundane science-fiction manifesto, Syms starts by saying: \u201cWe the mundane Afrofuturists, being alternately pissed off and bored, need a means of asserting a different set of values to begin imagining the future.\u201d Dreams of utopia, she says, \u201ccan encourage us to forget that outer space will not save us from injustice \u2026 post-black is a misnomer, post-colonialism is too\u201d. It\u2019s not all serious, of course. Syms\u2019 humour, transmuted to her work, is dry and sarcastic. At her ICA lecture, she deadpans some of her personal \u201crules\u201d: \u201cThe natural state of your skin is ashy. Shea butter is the only defence, use it generously. Lotion is for white people. When unoccupied, read from a book with an impenetrable title such as The Politics of Representation in Network Television.\u201d But at a time when black creatives from Cape Town to Chicago are building bodies of work and reputations on the very notions Syms is dismissing, her manifesto has been met with both praise and scorn.  \u201cI guess I can be a little mischievous!\u201d Syms counters. Mischievous is one word. Some might say volunteering to create a space for meaningful, open dialogue beyond the art bubble is bold, dangerous even, especially in an age when trolling is mistaken for candour and the ubiquitous presence of cameras means everything you\u2019ve ever said or produced could live forever online. Still, Syms insists she is ready for it: \u201cArt\u2019s function is to communicate. If someone goes to the show and they hate it and want to write about that, that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m happy for that. Don\u2019t email me about it. Don\u2019t @ me, but go ahead!\u201d \u2022 Fact & Trouble is at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, until 19 June.
