  "body": "Sadiq Khan has been elected mayor of London, reclaiming the post for Labour after eight years of Conservative rule and becoming the first Muslim mayor of a major western capital. Khan took 1,310,143 votes (57%) after second preferences were taken into account, beating Conservative Zac Goldsmith into second place on 994,614 (43%). His tally gave him the largest personal mandate of any politician in UK history. The 45-year-old son of a Pakistani bus driver beat Zac Goldsmith at the end of a sometimes bitter campaign during which the Conservatives accused Khan of being \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cpandering to extremists\u201d. Labour complained that Goldsmith\u2019s campaign was Islamophobic. In his victory speech Khan said he was \u201cdeeply humbled by the hope and trust\u201d voters placed in him, adding: \u201cI want to thank every single Londoner for making the impossible possible.\u201d  He added: \u201cI\u2019m so proud that Londoners have today chosen hope over fear and unity over division.\u201d  The convincing win will provide solace to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, after a poor set of election results overnight in Scotland, England and Wales. Khan becomes the first Labour leader at City Hall since the Conservatives\u2019 Boris Johnson unseated Ken Livingstone in 2008.

Lady Warsi, a former chairman of the Conservative party, described it as an \u201cappalling dog-whistle campaign\u201d and said it \u201clost us the election, our reputation and credibility on issues of race and religion\u201d. Roger Evans, the outgoing deputy mayor, said Goldsmith\u2019s \u201cvery foolish\u201d campaign left a \u201cnegative legacy which we in London are going to have to clear up long after the people who ran Zac Goldsmith\u2019s campaign have gone on their way\u201d. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t do this stupid thing again by trying to bring Sadiq down by saying he is an extremist,\u201d added Andrew Boff, a senior Tory on the London Assembly. \u201cHe is not an extremist. He went out and engaged with people with orthodox religious views. Dialogue is not assisted by shutting people out.\u201d Even Goldsmith\u2019s sister, Jemima, tweeted: \u201cSad that Zac\u2019s campaign did not reflect who I know him to be \u2013 an eco friendly, independent-minded politician with integrity.\u201d   Related: From pints to propaganda... it's the London mayoral election awards    Labour also secured 12 seats on the London Assembly, the Conservatives took eight while the Greens and Ukip took two each and the Liberal Democrats were reduced to one. The result paves the way for Khan to implement a manifesto programme that he promised would make him \u201ca mayor for all Londoners\u201d. The son of a bus driver, Khan was the fifth of eight children in his family and grew up on a council estate. He has promised to make solving London\u2019s housing crisis a key priority, and has said he will freeze fares on public transport for four years.           Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor - video profile    He said he would set a target that half of all new homes should be \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d, promised to boost landlord licensing and to name and shame rogue landlords. Oxford Street would be pedestrianised, he said. He would restore the capital\u2019s air quality to legal and safe levels and be \u201cthe most pro-business mayor yet\u201d. In continental Europe, where the mayoral election made headline news, the focus was firmly on Khan\u2019s religion and family background rather than his politics. Headlines in France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany included: \u201cThe first Muslim mayor of London\u201d, \u201cFirst Muslim mayor of a major European capital\u201d and \u201cThe green millionaire vs the leftwing Muslim\u201d. (The US Drudge Report, meanwhile, went with: \u201cDeveloping \u2013 first Muslim mayor of Londonistan.\u201d) Khan led Goldsmith, the MP for Richmond Park, for almost the whole campaign, but his lead narrowed over the last fortnight from 16 points to nine points on polling day, according to YouGov.    Related: Global press reaction to Sadiq Khan a mix of curiosity and ignorance    There was speculation that the antisemitism row surrounding Labour, which resulted in the suspension of Naz Shah MP and Ken Livingstone from the party, could dent his hopes. Khan did come second to Goldsmith in the Barnet and Camden constituency, which has a large Jewish population, leading to speculation the controversy may have affected the result. \u201cThe Conservatives will have to have a postmortem,\u201d said Travers. \u201cThey would have been better hacking away at Jeremy Corbyn day and night as a strategy.\u201d Goldsmith\u2019s campaign, overseen by the firm led by the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby, sought to paint Khan, whose family are from Pakistan, as a supporter of Muslim extremists.            Zac Goldsmith congratulates Sadiq Khan on election success    It sent leaflets to Hindu, Sikh and Tamil voters warning that Khan was \u201cdangerous\u201d. It did not mention that he was a Muslim, but several recipients felt it was divisive \u201cgutter politics\u201d. Another letter warning that Labour wanted to tax gold jewellery owned by many Indian families was also seen as stoking community tensions. The home secretary, Theresa May, described the former transport minister as \u201cunsafe\u201d to run London at a time when we face \u201ca significant threat of terrorism\u201d, because of his history of defending extremists when he was a human rights lawyer. Boris Johnson, who repeatedly joined Goldsmith on the campaign trail, had said: \u201cIn Islam and the Labour party there is a struggle going on, and in both cases Khan \u2013 whatever his real views \u2013 is pandering to the extremists.\u201d Khan is a married father of two who became a partner in a human rights law firm aged 27. He chaired the human rights group Liberty and was elected to parliament in Tooting in 2005. He became transport minister in the last year of Gordon Brown\u2019s government. If, as expected, Khan stands down from parliament, the result is set to trigger a byelection in Tooting, which Labour holds with a less than 3,000-vote majority requiring a 2.7% swing for the Conservatives to strike back.",
