And your plan better include voting,\u201d Obama said, bemoaning low youth turnout in the 2014 election. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that made a difference in terms of the Congress I\u2019ve had to deal with?\u201d In the 40-minute address, Obama was equally light-hearted, cracking inside jokes about campus eateries and dormitories, and serious in his charge of graduates to fight for change and justice. \u201cMy generation,\u201d he said, \u201cis too stuck in our ways to provide much of the new thinking that will be required\u201d. The president also urged the younger generation to channel their indignation into action. \u201cChange requires more than righteous anger \u2013 it requires change and it requires a program and it requires organizing,\u201d he said, noting the growth of young activist movements including \u201cblack Twitter\u201d and Black Lives Matter. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of the new guard of black activists who understand this,\u201d he added. \u201cTo bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt requires changes in law, changes in custom. If you care about mass incarceration, let me ask you, how are you pressuring members of Congress to pass the criminal reform bill now pending before them?\u201d In a likely allusion to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose rallies have been disrupted by progressive activists, Obama also discouraged graduates from trying to shut down the speeches and events of people they disagree with. \u201cThere\u2019s been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view or disrupt a politician\u2019s rally,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths. Because as my grandmother used to tell me, every time a fool speaks, they\u2019re just advertising their own ignorance.\u201d     Barack Obama chats with Valerie Jarrett and Vernon Jordan prior to delivering the speech.

In his address, the president made sure to mention some of the university\u2019s most distinguished alumni, such as Zora Neale Hurston, Thurgood Marshall and Ta-Nehisi Coates. Obama\u2019s relationship to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), such as Howard, has been complicated, and the Ivy League-educated president has sometimes been accused of keeping the institutions at arm\u2019s length. According to the Department of Education, overall federal funding to HBCUs is down slightly from 2008, after a peak during 2009-2010 thanks to Obama\u2019s ARRA stimulus package. In addition, some of the policies the administration has taken up to slow the ballooning growth of student loan debt have had a disproportionate impact on HBCU students, who often come from less wealthy households than students nationwide. But at Howard on Saturday, it was all celebration. The crowd erupted into cheers of \u201cObama, Obama\u201d several times and offered the president a raucous applause as he approached the lectern. Howard president Wayne Frederick also addressed some of the critiques of the president. He declared that Obama had \u201caddressed our educational needs to the fullest measure, by radically reforming the trillion-dollar student loan program\u201d and called him a \u201cnoble and courageous 21st-century visionary\u201d. Obama, in the final commencement season of his presidency, will also address graduates at Rutgers University and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.",
