  "body": "If you have an egg you have a meal. Eggs allow us to conjure all kinds of culinary magic. Eggs make a meal of something that otherwise might seem too slim or too simple. Whether it\u2019s dipping a buttered soldier into a runny yolk or crowning a simple plate of roasted ratatouille or humble lentils with a crisp edged, cheery yolked fried egg. Eggs make a meal. I once cooked for Prince Charles who, I was told, takes an egg with almost every meal \u2013 a wise man. I carefully poached one and sat it on top of his plate of spring risotto. I think of that meal every time I poach an egg, which actually isn\u2019t that often as John, my husband-to-be, is the head poacher in our house. I keep a little bowl of eggs next to our cooker. They come in all shades of blue, cream, brown and ivory but mostly I find myself reaching for the blue-shelled ones. They remind me of a still-life painting, most of all the Cedric Morris cover of Elizabeth David\u2019s classic, An Omelette and a Glass of Wine. The bowl gets emptied a couple of times a week when we haven\u2019t planned a meal or made it to the shops. We make French-style curdy herb omelettes, we softly scramble them, we spike them with chilli and wrap them in tortillas with spicy black beans for a hearty brunch and we fry them until crisp-edged for quick suppers with leftover fried potatoes and veg and a couple of spoonfuls of good chutney. It goes without saying that organic, free-range eggs should be used whenever possible. The sunnier the egg, the happier the eater. Roast shallots and greens with baked eggs This is a light, bright, late-spring brunch of baked eggs, courgettes, artichokes, sweet caramelised shallots and bright greens, all doused in the sunshine-mellow yellow of saffron. Serves 48 banana shallots2 tbsp olive oilSea salt4 small or 2 large courgettes, cut into 1cm coins2 garlic cloves, crushed2 heads of spring greens, washed and finely sliced4 cooked artichoke hearts, halvedA pinch of saffron, soaked in 50ml boiling water4 eggs  To serve  A small bunch of parsley, choppedA small bunch of mint, chopped A dollop of natural yoghurtChilli flakes (optional) 1 Peel the shallots, then slice them in half from root to tip. Warm the olive oil in a heavy-based, shallow pan that can go in the oven. Add the shallots and a big pinch of salt and lightly brown them on both sides. Keep the heat moderate. Set the oven at 200C/400F/gas mark 6. 2 When the shallots are soft, push them to one side and add the courgettes and garlic to the other side of the pan, cook for a few of minutes until the courgettes begin to turn golden. Then add the greens, artichokes, saffron water and another pinch of salt, and cook for a minute or two until the greens have just wilted, then transfer the whole pan to the oven. 3 Bake the vegetables for 15 minutes to allow the shallots and courgettes to roast and soften. Remove the pan from the oven and make four small, shallow hollows among the vegetables, then crack an egg into each of them. Return the vegetables and eggs to the oven for 4-5 minutes, until the whites are just set and the yolks are still runny. Serve with some chopped mint and parsley, a dollop of yoghurt and a sprinkle of chilli flakes, if you like.     Lentils, herbs and a fried egg Photograph: Issy Croker for the Guardian    Lentils, herbs and a fried egg This has become a staple quick dinner in our household. When I have a little longer, I cook the lentils from scratch but in a fix a tin of puy lentils works extremely well. The lentils have an agrodolce (sweet from the currants and tart from the capers) which I love. It\u2019s a quick and simple way of layering up the flavour without too much faff. The egg crowns the lentils and the just-right yolk dresses the lentils once it\u2019s broken into the bowl. Serves 4A splash of olive oil or coconut oil1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped\u00bd tsp each of cumin, coriander, tumeric, cinnamon, chilli powderSalt and black pepper2 x 400g tin of puy lentils or 600g home cooked lentils2 tbsp small capers2 tbsp currants4 eggs  To serveA handful of soft herbs, choppedA few handfuls of rocketA dollop of natural yoghurt 1 Heat a frying pan on a medium heat with a little oil. Once hot add the onion and fry for 10 minutes until soft. Add the spices and fry for another minute. 2 Add the lentils and 50ml of water and cook for 5 minutes until warm. 3 Fry the eggs in a little olive or coconut oil and season well. Sometimes I fry them until the edges crisp up, sometimes I flip them over easy, but I always keep the yolk runny. 4 Finish the lentils by stirring in the capers and currants, then pile the lentils on plates, top with an egg, a spoonful of yoghurt and a scattering of rocket leaves and herbs. It starts with an egg \u2026 Ten meals with four simple ingredients: Turkish flatbreadsTop gently charred flatbread with creamy plain yoghurt, finely chopped mint and parsley, sumac and a fried egg.
