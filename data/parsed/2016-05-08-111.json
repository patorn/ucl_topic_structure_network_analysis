When his Great Barrier Reef series was broadcast at the start of the year, it was reported that this was likely to be his last series, or at least his last made on location. But it\u2019s difficult to believe David Attenborough won\u2019t always be around. For most people who grew up in 20th-century Britain, he is not just a national treasure but a permanent fixture. But then, that\u2019s what we thought about the Great Barrier Reef. Just before the reef series was broadcast, Attenborough told a journalist that his first dive on the reef is the moment in his career he remembers most vividly: \u201cSuddenly, this amazing world with a thousand things you didn\u2019t know existed is revealed right in front of you, all wonderful colours and shapes. On land, the rainforest is comparable \u2013 but the difference is, you can walk for a day and see absolutely nothing. \u2018Where are all these bloody monkeys they are always on about?\u2019 But on a reef you see everything immediately.\u201d Greenpeace is campaigning to protect the Great Barrier Reef from new coalmines \u2013 huge mines that would threaten the reef directly through dredging and dumping, and indirectly by adding significantly to dangerous climate change. The more coal that is burned, the warmer and more acidic the oceans become. Warming ocean temperatures are the main cause of the recent bleaching of the reef.     \u2018Attenborough\u2019s point about the high visibility of the reef\u2019s biodiversity is of key significance.\u2019 David Attenborough with Mark Taylor during the filming of the Great Barrier Reef series Photograph: BBC/Atlantic Productions    Despite the much-publicised collapse of the coal industry, coal-fired power stations are still the world\u2019s biggest source of CO2 emissions, and bear an even greater share of historical emissions. That gives the industry primary responsibility for the climactic changes we are experiencing now, including the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. The reef has undergone three mass bleaching events that we know of, all during the last 20 years. The first two affected about 60% of the reef; this year\u2019s has affected 93%, and about half of the bleached coral is expected to die. New technologies, coupled with new commitment from the world\u2019s governments, might save the reef. But if we continue to burn fossil fuels, it has little chance of survival.     \u2018As we delay phasing out coal and other fossil fuels, we condemn natural wonders such as the reef to extinction.\u2019 The Great Barrier Reef in 2003 Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images    Attenborough\u2019s point about the high visibility of the reef\u2019s biodiversity \u2013 the fact that you can see hundreds of the reef\u2019s many thousands of species on a single dive \u2013 is of key significance. One of Greenpeace\u2019s original goals was to provide people with a clear view of what industries tried to hide \u2013 environmental destruction carried out away from prying eyes, normally at sea. But the reef is one of the world\u2019s most dived areas. Amazingly, despite this, the Australian government is ignoring this environmental catastrophe and refusing to recognise the damage caused by coal. Climate campaigners are used to trying to motivate people around a disaster that unfolds silently over decades, but this is different. You are living through the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. Half of it is dead or dying now, because of our addiction to fossil fuels. James Delingpole, chief climate change denier on the far-right website Breitbart, tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it already so I don\u2019t care. In fact I\u2019m glad because it makes my experience rarer and more special.\u201d As we delay phasing out coal and other fossil fuels, we condemn natural wonders such as the reef to extinction. But we can still learn from the huge bleached skeleton sunk off Australia\u2019s coast. There is no slack left in the system. We cannot keep heading in the same direction and then perform some miraculous handbrake turn just before we reach \u201ccatastrophic climate change\u201d. Climate change is already catastrophic, and it\u2019s going to get more catastrophic. The faster we get our act together the more we will save, but every delay in cleaning up our act, every new coalmine and every new airport, is a death sentence for something or someone. The signing of the Paris agreement a fortnight ago is a real cause for optimism in the fight against climate change. With 175 signatories \u2013 the most countries ever to sign any international agreement at the same time \u2013 it felt like the start of a new era. With the Great Barrier Reef dying before our eyes, it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Happy birthday, David Attenborough.",
