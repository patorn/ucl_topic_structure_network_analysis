  "body": "Hut in the middle of nowhere, Poland A listing that reads \u201chut in the middle of nowhere\u201d can\u2019t help but pique the interest, and this one\u2019s description is pretty accurate. The wooden hut in Dar\u017ckowo, northern Poland, is a perfect retreat for anyone who wants to be cut off from the world for a bit. Though modestly furnished, it has two bedrooms, a kitchen and a fireplace, and is on the edge of a small lake. Its owners are a city family who \u201csearched, searched and searched\u201d for a place where they could \u201cshelter from their troubles\u201d; now, they\u2019ve shared it with the world. It\u2019s not the only lonely waterside spot we came across in Poland, though. Right on the border with Germany, we found the beautiful cabane en for\u00eat, a chic little retreat on the bank of the Oder river.\u2022 \u00a330 a night, sleeps four, airbnb.co.uk Saimaa adventure, Finland      A country of 187,888 lakes, Finland isn\u2019t short of places for watery exploration. Lake Puruvesi, in the easterly Saimaa region, is a stunning setting for an escape. As the name suggests, Puruvesi is known for its incredibly clean water, making it an inviting place to swim, as well as go on fishing or boat trips. This particular cabin \u2013 Lakeside Nightingale \u2013 is close to a conservation area and the world\u2019s largest wooden church, in nearby Kerim\u00e4ki. It is a newly built two-bedroom villa with a contemporary interior designed for relaxation: it\u2019s full of light, with a log fire and a decked terrace from which to enjoy the view. Add to this an electric sauna and it\u2019s the perfect setup for anyone seeking a Nordic adventure. \u2022 Three nights from \u20ac573, sleeps six, finlandcottagerentals.com Lake Bled private beach, Slovenia      It\u2019s hard to write anything about Europe\u2019s lakes without mentioning Slovenia, home to the incredibly photogenic Lake Bled. Of course, Bled can get very busy during the tourist season, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no solace there. This lakeside cabin, 15 minutes\u2019 walk from the main town, has a private beach, making it the perfect spot for anyone who wants to make the most of swimming in the cool blue water, which, despite its Alpine surroundings, stays at a pleasant temperature from June to September. The cabin has a fully equipped kitchen and bathroom, as well as a decking area and bikes that guests can borrow for free. \u2022 \u00a3146 a night, sleeps up to five, airbnb.co.uk Green and wild, Sweden      Undoubtedly the most \u201cback to nature\u201d of our selection, Kolarbyn eco-lodge forgoes electricity and running water for wooden huts, sheepskin rugs and candles. Two minutes\u2019 walk from Sk\u00e4rsj\u00f6n lake and surrounded by fairytale forest, these 12 huts sleep two in traditional charcoal-burner style (Kolarbyn produces charcoal using ancient kiln methods). Each hut has a wood fire and there are blueberries to pick from the green roof \u2013 though there is also a log cabin for those who prefer a bit more room and some traditional bedding. Guests have to chop their own firewood and cooking is all done on a barbecue. However, some timeless luxury can be attained, thanks to a wood-fired floating sauna, with room for 10 people, which can be hired. For those keen to explore the area, the campsite runs activities including a mindfulness hike, beaver safari or wilderness riding expedition. \u2022 Charcoal hut from \u00a340pp a night (adult), \u00a320 (child), sleeps two; log cabin from \u00a3110 a night, kolarbyn.se Winter \u2013 and summer \u2013 wonderland, Norway      These four ridiculously quaint, red-painted wooden Nordic cabins are on a small bay in Flam, Aurland. With snow-capped peaks coated with deep green pine forests all around, holidaying here is like being in a Christmas card. The interiors are cosy, wood-panelled spaces, but still have all the mod cons expected on a longer self-catering holiday (Wi-Fi, TV, DVD player, washing machine). Each cottage has a rowing boat (included in the price) and they are suitable for breaks at any time of year \u2013 when the days are long and balmy, or when the valley is covered in sparkling snow. \u2022 From \u00a3130 a night, each cabin sleeps six, fretheimhytter.com  Luxury in the great outdoors, Germany      Set in the Eifel national park in western Germany, near the Belgian border, Chalet Waldeck is a luxurious holiday spot in an area full of opportunities for outdoor adventure. The chalet has a contemporary rural design, with exposed wooden beams, modern furniture and fittings and a private sauna. A lakeside path provides a starting point for exploring on foot, and canoeing and kayaking are also available. There are beaches for wild swimming on a lake 3km away, and park rangers run guided tours of the woods, known as a haven for birdwatchers. \u2022 From \u00a3117 a night, sleeps two, homeaway.co.uk Designer fjord stay, Iceland      An sleek architectural beauty that stands discreetly within the rugged Icelandic terrain that surrounds it, wooden Villa Lola is on the furthest inland tip of Eyjafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur , the longest fjord in Iceland. Anyone with a taste for design will be instantly attracted to this unique place to stay, and it\u2019s also perfectly positioned for hikes up S\u00falur mountain, horseback tours under the midnight sun or a round at the 18-hole golf course. In the winter, there\u2019s skiing at a local resort or dog sledding \u2013 another magical Arctic experience. \u2022 \u00a381 a night, sleeps four, airbnb.com Treetops and trekking, Portugal      Another unique waterside retreat can be found at the Lima Escape campsite in the vast Peneda-Ger\u00eas national park, known for its river valleys, oak forests and undulating geography. As well as casual camping (and glamping, thanks to a couple of bell tents), the highlight of the site has to be two modernist treehouse cabins (one sleeps two and the other four) perched on wooden beams among the trees. The site is in a bend of the Lima river, a magical shady spot popular with hikers. The area lends itself to high-elevation treks, mountain biking, climbing and horse riding. The nearby town of Lindoso has a weekly market on the riverside. In the evenings, there is a bar and cafe at the campsite, for those who can tear themselves away from the cabin\u2019s peaceful terrace. \u2022 One-bedroom treehouse from \u20ac45 a night, two bedroom from \u20ac55, lima-escape.pt  Water, woods and wildlife, Sweden      If the charcoal huts at Kolarbyn sound a bit too Bear Grylls-y, this cabin retreat three hours west in V\u00e4rmland make a good alternative. There are two wood cabins on the site, both traditionally made, both with green roof, cosy bedrooms and fully appointed kitchen and facilities. And, of course, there is also a sauna. Both sleep four. and one cabin has an outhouse that could accommodate two more people. Positioned right on the water, cabins each have their own canoe or boat, which can be used to seek out secret picnic spots among the network of lakes. Inland, there is dense forest to discover, full of wildlife from beavers to elks. \u2022 From \u00a3660 a week, naturetravels.co.uk Romantic hideaway, France       South-west France has a fair few charming waterside cabins to choose from, not least a vintage bus at an eco resort in Limoges. One of the coolest places we found, or rather, one of the most romantic, was Caru Cabin at Terre et Toi resort in the Dordogne. Built by hand and perched on a wooden platform over a private pond, the cabin has everything required for a honeymoon-type hideaway: paper lanterns, skylight above the bed, wood-burning stove and sun deck. There are a few other glamping huts at the site, other guests to socialise and eat with around the wood-fired pizza oven, and bikes to hire for a ride to the local village. \u2022 \u00a387 a night, sleeps two, canopyandstars.co.uk",
