  "body": "For Laura Watts, the best thing about her parents\u2019 house, with its striking early 70s design, was always the woodland which surrounds it. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a treehouse, with enormous windows,\u201d she says. \u201cCrows used to peck on the windows and wake us up in the mornings. You\u2019d see deer walking by, and rabbits. There were lots of tiny frogs at the pond. It was a wildlife house, really.\u201d While Watts and her siblings were climbing trees and fighting imaginary bears outside, their parents Celia and William Goodhart might have been preparing to hobnob with politicians and academics in their \u201cwacky country house\u201d three miles southwest of Oxford. The sloping modern home was designed by Celia\u2019s brother-in-law, architect Hal Moggridge. A steep staircase, decorated with plaster fashioned to look like exposed cement, joins a diagonal hallway to connect the house\u2019s six bedrooms and deliberately designed large spaces for entertaining. William Goodhart \u2013 a human rights lawyer and Liberal Democrat politician \u2013 and his family are well connected. \u201cThere were plenty of debates,\u201d says Watts, \u201cespecially with my uncle, a Conservative MP, who lived down the hill. But they usually avoided talking politics with him. They had different views and that was that.\u201d     \u2018You\u2019d see deer walking by, and rabbits\u2019: a view of the house from the garden. Photograph: Gavin Kingcome    Moggridge was influenced in his design by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, who believed that buildings should exist in harmony with their natural environments, as well as Finnish architect Alvar Aalto and famous structures of the era such as the Royal Festival Hall. \u201cAt first the whole of the front of the house was going to be glass,\u201d says Moggridge. \u201cIt was very fashionable at that time. But my parents were worried, completely rightly, about the brightness and overexposure. So the form of the house changed and the windows became holes punched into the wooden walls.\u201d The family didn\u2019t just stumble on the secluded plot of land: it was once the site of a crumbling Victorian mansion that belonged to archaeologist Arthur Evans, which Watts\u2019s grandfather, who lived next door, bought in an auction in the 1940s. \u201cNo one bid for it, apparently,\u201d says Moggridge. \u201cThey had to demolish the big old house that Evans lived in; he wanted to give it to Oxford University, but they didn\u2019t want it. It was rather derelict.\u201d The ambitious project remains one of only three houses created by Moggridge, who is now a landscape architect. \u201cIt was the biggest real project I\u2019d done,\u201d he says. \u201cThe place was totally overgrown. When we first were surveying it, it was a matter of crawling through the undergrowth. My wife helped me, as I was a one-man band at the time.\u201d     \u2018The built-in storage made fantastic hiding places\u2019: looking into the dining room from the kitchen. Photograph: Gavin Kingcome    A lot of care was taken when it came to selecting the materials for the interiors, he adds. The exceptionally high wooden ceiling in the first-floor drawing room is made from Parana pine, while the concrete columns and beams were made by the same company which provided the materials to build St Catherine\u2019s College in Oxford. The elderly Goodharts lived in their home, known as Youlbury House, for years after they retired, and succeeded in having it grade II listed in 2009. Now they are moving out and the house is back on the market. Watts still remembers the house fondly. \u201cThe built-in storage made fantastic hiding places and spaces to play in. We did spend a lot of our time playing in the airing cupboard.\u201d And while Moggridge says he is proud that his design has \u201cweathered quite well\u201d, it\u2019s the long evenings spent putting the world to rights which stand out in his memory. \u201cThey had a lot of good parties which we were often invited to,\u201d he recalls. \u201cEven when there were just a few people we\u2019d have a drink. They had some very interesting friends.\u201d",
