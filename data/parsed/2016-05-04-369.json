  "body": "Scott Morrison has sought to blame Labor for the fact Australia\u2019s aid budget is its least generous in history, saying the government would not have had to cut $224m from it had Labor not \u201cset fire to the budget\u201d. The budget confirmed official development assistance will be $3.8bn in 2016-17, confirming a $224m reduction in spending foreshadowed in earlier budgets. Aid groups have complained the cut left Australia\u2019s contribution at a record low as a proportion of national income and would trigger cuts to life-saving programs. On Wednesday, when asked about his maiden speech in 2008 in favour of raising foreign aid, the treasurer told the National Press Club: \u201cWhen I gave that speech, this country had a $20bn surplus. \u201cWhen I gave that speech, we had $40bn in the bank and Labor blew it all. They blew it all, with reckless policies that set fire to the budget.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s regrettable, it grieves me, I know it grieves [foreign minister] Julie [Bishop] terribly. But don\u2019t elect the government that\u2019s going to set fire to the budget, then you won\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d  Foreign aid will be cut by $11.3bn over five years compared with levels Labor projected in May 2013. Australia has signed on to the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid but the 2016-17 budget leaves that figure at 0.23%.   Related: Australians massively overestimate level of foreign aid in budget, poll finds    The chief executive of the Australian Council for International Development, Marc Purcell, said the budget had delivered the fourth successive aid budget cut. \u201cIf re-elected, the Turnbull government will preside over the lowest-ever level of Australian aid for the full term of the next parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough cuts to programs, the poorest have suffered by life-saving programs ceasing.\u201d Aid cuts damaged Australia\u2019s relationships with neighbours such as Afghanistan and Burma, Purcell said. Oxfam Australia\u2019s budget spokeswoman Joy Kyriaco said the cut meant Australia gave just 23 cents in aid for every $100 of national income, one of the lowest levels in its history. \u201cIt beggars belief that the government has now cut more than $11.3bn from Australian aid,\u201d Kyriacou said. \u201cOxfam has already had to scale back life-saving work in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 the poorest region in the world \u2013 due to unprecedented aid cuts.\u201d Childfund Australia\u2019s chief executive, Nigel Spence, said the budget had made \u201ceven deeper cuts to an already decimated aid budget\u201d. Spence said: \u201cWe have to realise these cuts have a significant human cost for some of the most vulnerable children and families in our region and beyond.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had to cut education projects, child protection projects and an innovative global education program that was building bridges between children in Australia and developing countries throughout Asia.\u201d The campaign director for Campaign for Australian Aid, Tony Milne, said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d with the budget cut, which made Australia \u201cthe least generous we\u2019ve ever been\u201d.  \u201cWe are walking away from our role as a global citizen and building a fairer world.\u201d In a statement, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said the $3.8bn spent on aid made Australia \u201capproximately the 12th largest donor in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u201d.  \u201cThe aid program will continue to focus on the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d she said. \u201cThe budget highlights Australia\u2019s ongoing commitment to humanitarian assistance. Australia will increase the emergency fund to $130m in 2016-17, to enable timely and effective responses to disasters and other humanitarian crises.\u201d She said the government would give a further $220m over the next three years to address the humanitarian needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting large numbers of refugees. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, said Australia\u2019s aid program was now the weakest in history. \u201cThe Liberals have trashed Australia\u2019s reputation as a good global citizen.\u201d She told Guardian Australia: \u201cLabor will always do better on aid than the Liberals. Our record speaks for itself \u2013 in government, Labor doubled the aid budget.\u201d  Plibersek committed to provide $450m for refugee assistance, and $40m for non-governmental organisations working on maternal and child health, schooling, clean water and sanitation in the developing world.",
