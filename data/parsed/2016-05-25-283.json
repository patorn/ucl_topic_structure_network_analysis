  "body": "Does tough regulation turn round failing care homes? Jan Whyment thinks that it does, because she cannot speak highly enough of the specialist dementia facility that is home to her\u00a0son, David. Yet little more than a year ago, inspectors declared it \u201cinadequate\u201d and ordered immediate remedial action. The Acorn care home, a 22-bed unit in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, has\u00a0undergone such a remarkable transformation that it is now considered \u201cgood\u201d on all measures. It is one of 73% of care homes initially judged inadequate by Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors that have raised their game sufficiently to be upgraded on reinspection. Andrea Sutcliffe, the commission\u2019s chief inspector of adult social care, thinks that the figures \u2013 the first before-and-after comparisons that have been produced \u2013 are \u201cvery encouraging\u201d. She says: \u201cWhat we want to be saying to people is that it\u2019s never too late to turn things round.\u201d   Related: Care home crisis won\u2019t be solved by just paying more, says Justin King    Of 372 homes in England originally rated inadequate by the CQC under its\u00a0new \u201cspecialised, expert-led and intelligence-driven\u201d approach that started in October 2014, 273 improved their grade on reinspection, which takes place usually within six months. Of these, 205 rose one level to \u201crequires improvement\u201d and 68, like Acorn, rose two levels to good. None has yet achieved the fourth, top, rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d. The downside is that 99 homes, or more than one in four, failed to make sufficient improvement to be upgraded. Nursing homes (78% of which improved) proved better than residential alone (68%). A further 34 homes found inadequate were not reinspected because they had either closed or been sold. Sutcliffe acknowledges that more needs to be done to chase the laggards. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to be complacent, or indeed for the providers to be complacent,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly a quarter [of those making an improvement] have gone from inadequate to good, but then that is a really significant jump.\u201d Acorn made the jump after CQC inspectors descended on the home last February. The then registered manager resigned within 24 hours and an enforcement notice was issued where the service was found in breach of legal requirements. The inspection report, released three months later, found the home inadequate on three of the five standard measures \u2013 safety, effectiveness and leadership \u2013 and as requiring improvement on being caring and responsive. The home\u2019s owners, a small chain called 1st Care, drafted in a new manager while the first inspection was\u00a0still under way. That sparked the rapid turnaround which resulted in the home being rated good on all five measures when it was reinspected last August. The manager, Jas Richards, is a qualified nurse. But she prefers to be thought of as a team leader rather than as either of those things. \u201cEverything was a shambles and we had 60 days to turn it round,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe worked day and night. The key thing was that the team wanted to make the change, wanted someone to listen to them.\u201d Nick Richards, 1st Care\u2019s operations director, attributes the home\u2019s striking overhaul to Richards\u2019s \u201cpositivity, sensitivity and determination\u201d, but also to what he calls the CQC\u2019s \u201cjustifiably robust\u201d approach. He stresses that the company retained a positive working relationship with the inspectorate throughout, in spite of the issuing of an enforcement notice. \u201cHaving a warning notice served sounds pernicious,\u201d Richards says. \u201cBut we actually used it as a tool to say to the team: \u2018This has got to happen and it can\u2019t wait 12 months \u2013 it\u2019s got to happen now.\u2019\u201d For Whyment, Acorn\u2019s turnaround means she has the reassurance that her 49-year-old son, who has early onset dementia and has been at the home just over a year, is in a safe, supportive and caring environment. \u201cI was full of scepticism when they said he had to go into a home,\u201d she says. \u201cBut really, it feels like it\u2019s his home \u2013 not a home. \u201cI thought it was good from the get-go, but it\u2019s just got better and better. You\u00a0see little improvements every time you visit.\u201d",
