  "body": "Rick Moody \u2013 of The Ice Storm fame, a brilliant novel adapted into the equally stunning film directed by Ang Lee \u2013 delights with his ingenious new novel. The premise \u2013 a memoir in the form of a collection of hotel reviews that span 40-odd years in the reviewer\u2019s life \u2013 is both original and entertaining. The work of one Reginald Edward Morse, a motivational speaker by trade and top reviewer at RateYourLodging.com, the collection constitutes the unexpected magnum opus of a middle-aged man whose life is marked by loneliness and disappointment \u2013 a broken marriage, an estranged daughter, affairs, money troubles. If you\u2019ve seen Anomalisa it\u2019ll be impossible not to draw comparisons, and Moody treads a similarly fine line between the comic and the tragic \u2013 never, for example, has hotel porn been discussed with such pathos. Capturing the essence of our virtual reality- and social media-obsessed age, it\u2019s timely, moving and clever. Hotels of North America is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a312.99).
