  "body": "Maggie O\u2019Farrell manoeuvres her characters with a conjuror\u2019s sleight of hand: now you see them, now you don\u2019t. It\u2019s a\u00a0feat that first became apparent in The Vanishing Act\u00a0of Esme Lennox, in which a woman\u00a0assumed responsibility for an\u00a0unheard-of aunt who had spent 60\u00a0years in a psychiatric hospital. Her most recent novel, Instructions for a Heatwave, followed a similar pattern: a\u00a0retired man nips out for a newspaper and never comes back, until his family finally trace him to a convent in rural\u00a0Ireland. This Must Be The Place pulls off the biggest disappearing act of all, as the woman who vanishes is supposed to be\u00a0internationally famous. Claudette Wells is, or was, the wife and muse of a\u00a0temperamental Swedish film-maker. She is famed for her protean screen quality and sharp intelligence, though also for her bizarre, bag-lady appearance and tendency to throw distress flares at photographers. Above all she is notorious for having stormed off set at the height of her career, and never been seen again. The story of Claudette\u2019s withdrawal from the world is told by multiple narrators, none of whom you\u2019d instinctively trust, though the most reliable is Claudette\u2019s second husband, Daniel. A Brooklyn-born linguist, he is\u00a0well known on the late-night chat circuit: \u201cIf\u00a0you\u2019ve ever listened to a radio programme about neologisms or\u00a0grammatical shifts or the way teenagers usurp and appropriate terms for their own subversive use, it will probably have been me who was wheeled in\u00a0to say that change is good, elasticity is to be embraced.\u201d As it turns out, Daniel has a great deal of difficulty embracing elasticity and change as far as marriage to Claudette is concerned. For a start, he\u00a0is sworn to protect her anonymity; second, he has abandoned his own family in the US to be with her; and third, she has chosen to live in a derelict farmhouse in one of the most isolated and inaccessible valleys in Ireland: \u201cTo get here you really have to\u00a0want to get here.\u201d It\u2019s a situation that brings O\u2019Farrell\u2019s qualities as a humorist and stylist to the fore. \u201cThe key to life with Claudette,\u201d Daniel observes, \u201cis knowing that her\u00a0default setting is overreaction and\u00a0outrage.\u201d And O\u2019Farrell\u2019s seemingly effortless ability to give the mundane a\u00a0metaphorical lift remains as sharp as\u00a0ever. You know precisely what she\u00a0means when she refers to \u201cthose\u00a0double electric doors, curved in\u00a0shape,\u00a0which open and shut with a hesitant glide, creating a momentary parenthesis around those who pass through them\u201d. Stylistically the novel takes some audacious risks. One section is given over to an illustrated auction catalogue of Claudette memorabilia purloined by a former personal assistant. O\u2019Farrell inserts her own spoilers, telling us for instance that \u201cin several years\u2019 time Daniel will receive the news that his daughter has been killed in an accident\u201d. Chapter headings skip around in an unpredictable fashion: \u201cLenny, Los Angeles, 1994\u201d, for instance, or \u201cRosalind, Bolivia, 2015\u201d. Lenny is the\u00a0subject of the most fleeting cameo, and we do not actually meet Rosalind until page 418. The great thorn in the side for a narrative of this type is maintaining credibility. Both The Vanishing Act of\u00a0Esme Lennox and Instructions for a\u00a0Heatwave had the advantage of being\u00a0set in the 1940s and 70s respectively, before credit trails and surveillance systems were quite so well\u00a0developed. Though it\u2019s perfectly possible to believe that a former film star might choose to live in\u00a0a place untouched by mobile phone coverage, is it really so simple to throw the world off her scent by spreading rumours of\u00a0her death? That the novel should be so fully persuasive is down to O\u2019Farrell\u2019s recurrent theme \u2013 which is not so much how a person can unaccountably go missing as how swiftly and silently love may slip out of a relationship. Instructions for a Heatwave featured a\u00a0devastating passage in which a man, on a beach with his family, discovers that his marriage is over: \u201cHe realises that it is the end, their end, standing there on the beach with them, like a\u00a0third person\u201d. In the present novel, Daniel has a similar experience. \u201cAm I witnessing the beginning of the end, if this is it, the tipping point we all dread? Am I living through the moment when all the tiny lights begin to be extinguished, when her love for me begins to falter, shrink, lose ground? I have been through the demise of enough relationships to know such moments arise, but would I know how to recognise it when it came? Is this it? What have I done?\u201d It is O\u2019Farrell\u2019s ability to recognise such moments, when they inevitably come, that makes her such a deft and\u00a0compelling chronicler of human relationships. \u201cDo you think,\u201d Claudette asks her husband one morning in bed, \u201cthat we might have reached the end of our story?\u201d This is, Daniel reflects, \u201csuch a Claudette way to put it\u201d. And such an O\u2019Farrell way of putting it as well. \u2022 To order This Must Be the Place for \u00a315.19 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
