  "body": "The US has lifted a decades-old arms embargo on Vietnam in a historic move that follows the country\u2019s growing assertiveness against China\u2019s influence in the region. Speaking on a visit to Hanoi, Barack Obama said Washington had fully lifted \u201cthe ban on the sale of military equipment to Vietnam that has been in place for some 50 years\u201d. Obama is the third American president \u2013 after Bill Clinton and George W Bush \u2013 to visit since the war ended in 1975. \u201cAt this stage both sides have developed a level of trust and cooperation,\u201d he added during a joint press conference with the Vietnamese president, Tran Dai Quang.  Quang said the end to the embargo was \u201cclear proof that both countries have completely normalised relations\u201d. Despite a shared communist ideology, Vietnam is one of several countries engaged in a fierce territorial dispute with Beijing over islands and reefs in the South China Sea, a route for roughly \u00a33.17tn in trade. The area is also thought to have significant oil and gas reserves. China has reclaimed several atolls that Vietnam says it owns, and built military installations and runways on some islands. Vietnam, a country of 90 million, has also been a key partner for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a US-led trade deal seen as a counter to China\u2019s growing influence. However, Obama said the decision to lift the ban was not based on China but on \u201cour desire to complete what has been a lengthy process towards moving toward normalisation with Vietnam\u201d. The Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times ran an editorial titled \u201cObama unable to turn Hanoi into an ally\u201d and said while Beijing was a major opponent of Hanoi regarding the South China Sea, \u201cthe former is also considered by Hanoi\u2019s mainstream elites as a political pillar for Vietnam\u2019s stability\u201d. Activist groups have called for Obama to push for greater respect for human rights in Vietnam, where there are about 100 political prisoners in jail. In March, seven activists were sentenced for \u201cspreading anti-state propaganda\u201d. The ruling Communist party has run a one-party state since 1954. There has also been a recent round of arrests against environmental protesters, angered after 100 tonnes of dead fish were found near a Taiwanese-owned industrial complex. The Vietnamese government has cracked down on any attempt to protest, blocking access to Facebook over the weekend.  And on Sunday, the BBC reporting team was told their accreditation to cover Obama\u2019s visit had been withdrawn without reason. Obama said on Monday that any future arms sales would need to meet strict requirements \u201cincluding those related to human rights\u201d. Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, criticised the move. \u201cObama has jettisoned what remained of US leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam \u2013 and basically gotten nothing for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States government has been telling the Vietnam government for years that they need to show progress on their human rights record if they are going to be rewarded with closer military and economic ties. Yet today President Obama has rewarded Vietnam even though they have not done anything of note.\u201d Diplomatic ties between the US and Vietnam were restored in 1995. In 2007, the US allowed the sale of some non-lethal equipment and last December, Washington said it would provide five unarmed patrol boats to the Vietnamese coastguard. Following his three-day trip in Vietnam, Obama will travel to Japan for a G7 summit and a visit to Hiroshima. Reuters and AP contributed to this report.",
