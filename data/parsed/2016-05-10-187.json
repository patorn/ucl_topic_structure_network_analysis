A coalition of wildlife organizations wrote to the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) on Monday urging the agency to remove Bundy\u2019s cattle in the Gold Butte area of Nevada, where the 70-year-old has for years allowed his cows to graze freely on public lands in defiance of federal land-use restrictions. The advocates\u2019 demands come three months after federal officials arrested Bundy, eventually charging him and 18 other activists for their roles in a high-profile conflict at the family\u2019s ranch in Bunkerville, about 80 miles north-east of Las Vegas. For decades, Bundy refused to pay grazing fees to the federal government, arguing that the BLM had no right regulating land activity in the west. An ensuing court battle dragged on for years until the authorities showed up to his ranch in April 2014 with the intention of seizing his cows, which the government classified as an illegal trespass on public lands. But hundreds of supporters, some heavily armed, showed up to defend Bundy\u2019s cattle, forcing the government to stand down for fear of violence \u2013 a retreat that galvanized anti-government groups across the west. After Cliven\u2019s sons Ammon and Ryan staged a similar standoff on federal lands in Oregon in January, federal prosecutors aggressively targeted the Bundy family and their followers. Now, Cliven and four of his sons who participated in the 2014 standoff are in jail awaiting trial on serious federal felony charges that could force them to spend decades behind bars. Although the Bundy men are locked up, the cattle are still grazing without restrictions in an area that the government and environmentalists say is critical habitat for the Mojave desert tortoise, a threatened species. \u201cThe BLM must not wait to act to protect the desert tortoise,\u201d nine environmental and wildlife groups wrote in their letter, which cited a recent study showing how livestock grazing causes severe declines in tortoise populations. \u201cThe cattle should be rounded up and removed from these public lands no later than summer 2016.\u201d  BLM, however, currently has no seizure plan for the livestock, agency spokesman Jeff Krauss said in an email. \u201cMr Bundy\u2019s cattle continue to be in trespass. There are no plans for a gather at this time as we continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice on the ongoing legal matter.\u201d Spokespersons for the US justice department did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.  Angie Bundy, wife of Ryan, one of the jailed activists, said the family would not be surprised if federal authorities showed up again. \u201cI really believe they\u2019ve conveniently put our men in jails so they can come after our land and our resources.\u201d  Cliven\u2019s youngest son, Arden, 18, has taken on many of the responsibilities at the ranch, and other relatives are helping out, according to Angie. \u201cArden had to grow up fast,\u201d she said, adding that the ranch is still running smoothly. \u201cThe cows should do well this year if people leave them alone.\u201d In a court motion in February, prosecutors said the ranch had as many as 1,000 cattle straying as far as 50 miles away and further claimed that Cliven had neglected his livestock. \u201cWhile Bundy claims he is a cattle rancher, his ranching operation \u2013 to the extent it can be called that \u2013 is unconventional if not bizarre,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cRather than manage and control his cattle, he lets them run wild on the public lands with little, if any, human interaction.\u201d Rob Mrowka, senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, said that in addition to concerns about the tortoise competing with Bundy\u2019s livestock for food, advocates were worried about the welfare of the cows. Bailey Logue, one of Cliven\u2019s daughters, scoffed at those allegations, saying the family\u2019s cattle were in \u201cgreat health\u201d. \u201cUs women know how to ranch just like the guys do \u2026 The ranch is in great hands.\u201d  Nevada senator Harry Reid also recently stated that he would like to create a national conservation area by the Bunkerville ranch. Despite those comments and the calls from environmentalists, Bailey said she expected the family would see even more supporters at the ranch if the government tried to take their cattle a second time. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid,\u201d Angie added. \u201cIf you have a bunch of women and children standing out there and protesting, it\u2019ll probably get more people out.\u201d Travis Bruner, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, said the BLM needed to remove the cattle to send a message to other land-use activists that it would not tolerate these protests. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, livestock operators all over the west who graze on public land will feel emboldened to not adhere to laws and regulations.\u201d",
