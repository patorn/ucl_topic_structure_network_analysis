  "body": "Last year\u2019s Chelsea flower show represented the high point of a certain kind of traditional English horticultural charm. Returning to Chelsea for the first time in a decade, Dan Pearson won best in show for the Chatsworth Garden, inspired by the stately home and, in fact, including huge stones brought down from the garden on enormous lorries. A trout stream ran through moss and willow. It was a joy, but Chelsea as a whole met with criticism that it was growing tired, with a lack of fresh voices in design. \u201cWe found that the number of female designers was actually decreasing,\u201d says Matthew Appleby, deputy editor of Horticulture Week, \u201cbut the membership of the Guild of Landscape Designers is more than half women. The RHS [Royal Horticultural Society] wondered why it was happening, and it was because they weren\u2019t putting female designers on their shortlist.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d adds gardening writer and Chelsea veteran Val Bourne. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent among the women, but the top jobs tend to go to men.\u201d This year there are six main show gardens designed by women, up from two last year. Jo Thompson is perhaps the best established of them. She has designed the Chelsea Barracks Garden, sponsored by Qataria Diar. Rosy Hardy has created Forever Freedom for Brewin Dolphin, and Catherine MacDonald has created a garden for growers Hartley Botanic. Jekka McVicar, the doyenne of herbs, has moved away from the show tents to bring to life \u201ca modern apothecary\u201d. Hay Joung Hwang, originally from South Korea, has created the Smart Garden, sponsored by electronics giant LG.     Star of the show: Juliet Sargeant, who designed the Modern Slavery Garden at Chelsea Physic Garden, London.

Juliet Sargeant aims to raise awareness of modern slavery. Her garden \u2013 in the Fresh category \u2013 will have an oak at its centre to represent the tree under which William Wilberforce sat when he decided to abolish slavery. \u201cWhen I was invited to design the garden [my race] didn\u2019t even occur to me, but I suppose I am [the first black female designer],\u201d Sargeant says. \u201cAnd I do think that it\u2019s important to say something. The industry isn\u2019t as diverse as it could be, and we need to ask ourselves why that is. \u201cThe RHS is a very, very traditional organisation, but hopefully things will start to change. I see lots of young people from different cultures enjoying their gardens, but that interest isn\u2019t reflected at Chelsea.\u201d Her garden has not been simple, either. \u201cAs it\u2019s an anti-slavery garden, we wanted to check that everything in our garden was slave-free, but it\u2019s an incredibly hard thing to guarantee \u2013 the supply chains from around the world are so complex.\u201d With Diarmuid Gavin, Andy Sturgeon and Cleve West, all loaded with gold medals, making appearances, the bookies say the money is still on the boys, at least in the Show Gardens category. But the message couldn\u2019t be clearer: change is afoot in SW3. Beyond the border Now in its fifth year, the Chelsea Fringe sees dozens of events around the country \u2013 and further afield \u2013 putting on horticultural talks, walks, meals, deals and every other kind of event (chelseafringe.com), while around the ground itself local businesses are competing for the Chelsea in Bloom prize. The Chelsea flower show runs from 24-28 May",
