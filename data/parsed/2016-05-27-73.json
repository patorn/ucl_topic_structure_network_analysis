  "body": "The French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has promised to stand firm over controversial labour reforms as the hardline CGT union urged workers to step up fuel and energy strikes to force him to abandon his proposed law. After days of strike blockades at oil refineries and fuel depots forced France to dip into its strategic fuel supplies to counter petrol shortages, Hollande told reporters at the G7 summit in Japan: \u201cI will stand firm because I think it is a good reform.\u201d  He said the government\u2019s priority was to ensure the \u201cnormal functioning of the economy\u201d in the face of some of most severe industrial action in decades, which has resulted in scores of pumps running dry and violent clashes in Paris.

Why is France being racked by strikes and protests over its labour bill?    The employers\u2019 federation, Medef, said the strikes would have a negative effect on France\u2019s fragile economic growth. its head, Pierre Gattaz, said the government should resist \u201cblackmail\u201d, calling the strikers \u201cthugs\u201d.  The government is under increasing pressure to find a way out of the standoff, but neither president nor unions have indicated they are prepared to budge.  While there were still long queues at petrol stations in some parts of the country on Friday, the situation eased slightly in some areas as union blockades of fuel depots were lifted. But six of France\u2019s eight oil refineries were still shut down or operating at reduced capacity as a result of the union action.

Strikes continued at nuclear power stations \u2013 which provide three quarters of the country\u2019s electricity \u2013 but have not affected supply.  Polls have shown that a majority of French people blame the government for the crisis, saying it mishandled the reforms. An Opinionway poll found 66% of French people think the government should abandon their plans.     Riot police and protesters during a demonstration against the reforms in Paris.

The government argues its measures are a much-needed loosening of France\u2019s famously rigid labour protections, cutting red tape and tweaking some of the more cumbersome rules that deter employers from hiring.  The Elys\u00e9e argues they would make France more competitive and help tackle stubborn mass unemployment, that tops 10% of the workforce.  But after more than two months of street demonstrations, the CGT has radically upped its strategy and is now trying to choke off the nation\u2019s fuel supply to force Hollande to abandon what it sees as a betrayal of workers\u2019 rights.",
