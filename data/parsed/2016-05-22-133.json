  "body": "Ever since Charles Babbage\u2019s conceptual, unrealised Analytical Engine in the 1830s, computer science has been trying very hard to race ahead of its time. Particularly over the last 75 years, there have been many astounding developments \u2013 the first electronic programmable computer, the first integrated circuit computer, the first microprocessor. But the next anticipated step may be the most revolutionary of all. Quantum computing is the technology that many scientists, entrepreneurs and big businesses expect to provide a, well, quantum leap into the future. If you\u2019ve never heard of it there\u2019s a helpful video doing the social media rounds that\u2019s got a couple of million hits on YouTube. It features the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, detailing exactly what quantum computing means. Trudeau was on a recent visit to the\u00a0Perimeter Institute for Theoretical\u00a0Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, one of the world\u2019s leading centres for the study of the field. During a press conference there, a reporter asked him, half-jokingly, to explain quantum computing. Quantum mechanics is a conceptually counterintuitive area of science that has baffled some of the finest minds \u2013 as Albert Einstein said \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe\u201d \u2013 so it\u2019s not something you expect to hear politicians holding forth on. Throw it into the context of computing and let\u2019s just say you could easily make Zac Goldsmith look like an expert on Bollywood. But Trudeau rose to the challenge and gave what many science observers thought was a textbook example of how to explain a complex idea in a simple way.           Justin Trudeau stuns audience with quantum computing knowledge    The concept of quantum computing is relatively new, dating back to ideas put forward in the early 1980s by the late Richard Feynman, the brilliant American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate. He conceptualised the possible improvements in speed that might be achieved with a quantum computer. But theoretical physics, while a necessary first step, leaves the real brainwork to practical application. With normal computers, or classical \u00a0computers as they\u2019re now called, there are only two options \u2013 on\u00a0and off \u2013 for processing information. A computer \u201cbit\u201d, the smallest unit into which all information is broken down, is either a \u201c1\u201d or a \u201c0\u201d. And the computational power of a normal computer is dependent on the number of binary transistors \u2013 tiny power switches \u2013 that are contained within its\u00a0microprocessor. Back in 1971 the first Intel processor was made up of 2,300 transistors. Intel now produce microprocessors with more than 5bn transistors. However, they\u2019re still limited by their simple binary options. But as Trudeau explained, with quantum computers the bits, or \u201cqubits\u201d as they are known, afford far more options owing to the uncertainty of their physical state. In the mysterious subatomic realm of quantum physics, particles can act like waves, so that they can be particle or wave or particle and wave. This is what\u2019s known in quantum mechanics as superposition. As a result of superposition a qubit can be a 0 or 1 or 0 and 1. That means it can perform two equations at the same time. Two qubits can perform four equations. And three qubits can perform eight, and so on in an exponential expansion. That leads to some inconceivably large numbers, not to mention some mind-boggling working concepts.    In artificial intelligence and cryptography, it\u2019s thought that quantum computing will transform the landscape    At the moment those concepts are closest to entering reality in an unfashionable suburb in the south-west corner of Trudeau\u2019s homeland. In a neat, spacious lab in Burnaby, a satellite of Vancouver, I\u2019m looking inside what appears to be a large black fridge about 10 feet high. Within it is an elaborate structure of circuit boards, not unlike the sort of thing a physics class might construct out of Meccano, except with beautifully colourful niobium wafers as the centrepiece. It all looks fairly unremarkable, yet somewhere in here a multiplicity of different universes are thought to exist. The lab belongs to a small company called D-Wave, a highly skilled collection of just 140 employees that prides itself on building the world\u2019s first functioning quantum computer, which is what is contained within the large fridge-like casing. Actually it is a fridge, the coldest fridge ever assembled. The cooling apparatus enables the niobium computer chip at\u00a0its core to function at a temperature\u00a0of just under \u2013273C, or as close to absolute zero as the known\u00a0universe gets. The supercooled environment is necessary to maintain coherent quantum activity of superposition and entanglement, the state in which particles begin to interact \u2013 again rather mysteriously \u2013 co-dependently, and the qubits are linked by quantum mechanics regardless of their position in space. Any intrusion of heat or light would corrupt the process and thus the effectiveness of the computer. Exactly how and why quantum physics adheres to these science-fiction like rules remains an issue of great speculation, but perhaps the most common theory is that the different quantum states exist in separate universes. The D-Wave quantum computer I look at has one thousand\u00a0qubits.     The future is here (and also there): a D-Wave quantum processor. Photograph: D-Wave    \u201cA thousand qubit computer can be in 2 to the 1,000 states at one time, which is 10 to the 300th power,\u201d says D-Wave\u2019s CEO, Vern Brownell. \u201cThere\u2019s only 10 to the 80th atoms in the universe. Now does this mean it\u2019s in 10 to the 300th universes at the same\u00a0time?\u201d Can billions of different universes coexist within one computer? That\u2019s the sort of question that is probably best not grappled with before midnight and without the aid of illegal stimulants. And in a sense, the answer doesn\u2019t matter. The more immediate and relevant question is whether or not this quantum computer works. At the moment quantum computing still resides within a largely theoretical or speculative realm. The potential is staggering, involving a computational power many times the order of all the world\u2019s existing classical computers combined. But realising that potential is a fiendishly difficult task. That\u2019s why D-Wave\u2019s 2X computer costs more than $15m and only a handful of organisations have so far bought one. Still, as those organisations include Google, Lockheed Martin and Nasa, and among D-Wave\u2019s investors are Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and the CIA\u2019s hi-tech arm, In-Q-Tel, it\u2019s clear that some of the world\u2019s most forward- looking institutions believe that the computer has a future. In areas such as artificial intelligence and cryptography, it\u2019s thought that quantum computing will transform the landscape, perhaps bringing about the breakthrough that will enable machines to \u201cthink\u201d with the nuance and interpretative skill of humans. Brownell used to be chief of technology at Goldman Sachs. In that job there were few tech developments that he didn\u2019t have pitched at him. He believes that while social media successes like Facebook are clever utilisations of existing technology, the fact that Silicon Valley is constantly chasing profitable variations on the same theme means that it is no longer doing the really tough mental work. \u201cThe level of innovation is much, much less than we\u2019ve seen historically and probably at an all-time low in terms of the real world-changing innovations.\u201d   Related: The potential of quantum computing \u2013 Science Weekly podcast    D-Wave, he says, boldly bucks this trend. But that\u2019s not how he used to think. When he first heard about D-Wave seven years ago, the company had been going for nine years and, in some informed circles, was a bit of a laughing stock. His initial reaction when the company approached him was deep scepticism. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at first at all,\u201d he\u00a0says, \u201cparticularly as there were all these blog comments with experts\u00a0saying it was snake oil. I wasn\u2019t\u00a0really interested.\u201d His attitude changed when he came out and met the team. D-Wave was co-founded by Geordie Rose, a 44-year-old physics PhD who, doubtful about academia, took a course in entrepreneurship. He was impatient with the research approach of highly expensive but severely limited laboratory experiments. Rose\u2019s novel idea was to build a functioning quantum computer with commercial appeal. But this is where the science starts to cause people to pull their hair out. Most experimental quantum computers that had been assembled in labs followed the universal gate model, in which qubits substituted for transistors, without any notable success. Rose chose instead to develop an \u201cadiabatic\u201d quantum computer, which works by a process of what\u2019s called \u201cquantum annealing\u201d or \u201ctunnelling\u201d. In essence, it means you develop an algorithm that assigns specific interactions between the qubits along the lines of the classical model \u2013 ie if this is a 0, that one is 1 etc. Then create the conditions for quantum superposition, in which the qubits can realise their near infinite possibilities, before returning them to the classical state of 0s and 1s. The idea is the qubits will follow the path of least energy in relation to the algorithmic requirements, thus finding the most efficient answer. If that\u2019s hard enough to explain, imagine how difficult it was to build. And the early results were not encouraging. No one seemed to be sure what, if anything, was going on at a quantum level, but whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t impressive. D-Wave\u2019s first demonstration in 2007 of its 16-qubit device, which involved solving a sudoku puzzle, hardly set the world on fire. Umesh Vazirani, co-author of a paper on quantum complexity theory, dismissed D-Wave\u2019s claims of speedup as a misunderstanding of his work, and suggested that \u201ceven if it turns out to be a true quantum computer, and even if it could be scaled\u00a0to thousands of qubits, [it] would\u00a0likely not be more powerful than \u00a0a cellphone\u201d.    Even if no one ever builds a useful quantum computer we still learn an immense amount by attempting to  Dr Nic Harrigan, Bristol University     Thereafter the company was regularly accused of hype and exaggeration. Part of the problem was that it was very hard to measure with any agreed accuracy what was happening. D-Wave came up with a test to show that entanglement \u2013 seen as a necessary prerequisite for a working quantum computer \u2013 was taking place. But some experts doubted the reliability of the test. When D-Wave passed a different test, developed by an independent scientist, sceptics argued that while entanglement might be happening, the only real test was\u00a0performance. In 2013, the D-Wave Two was cited in one test as performing 3,600 times faster than a classical computer. But yet again these results were rubbished by several prominent scientists in the field. In 2014 Matthias Troyer, a renowned professor of computational physics, published a report that stated that he found \u201cno evidence of quantum\u00a0speedup\u201d. A longtime doubter of D-Wave\u2019s claims is Scott Aaronson, a professor at MIT, who has called himself \u201cChief D-Wave Sceptic\u201d. After Troyer\u2019s paper, he argued that although quantum effects were probably taking place in D-Wave\u2019s devices, there was no reason to believe they played a causal role or that they were faster than a classical computer. Brownell is dismissive of these critics, claiming that the \u201cquestion has been largely settled\u201d. He cites Google\u2019s comparative test last year in which its D-Wave quantum computer solved certain problems 100m times faster than a classical computer. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t quantum computing,\u201d asks Brownell, \u201cthen how did we build something that\u2019s a hundred million times faster than an Intel Core? It either has to be quantum computing or some other law of nature that we haven\u2019t discovered yet that\u2019s even more exciting than quantum mechanics. I challenge any scientist in the world to tell us: if it\u2019s not quantum annealing, what is it?\u201d           We should be more afraid of computers than we are    Even Aaronson acknowledged that the Google test was significant. \u201cThis is certainly the most impressive demonstration so far of the D-Wave machine\u2019s capabilities. And yet,\u201d he added, \u201cit remains totally unclear whether you can get to what I\u2019d consider \u2018true quantum speedup\u2019 using D-Wave\u2019s architecture.\u201d But Troyer was not convinced. \u201cYou need to read the fine print,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is 108 times faster than some specific classical algorithm on problems designed to be very hard for that algorithm but easy for D-Wave\u2026 A claim of 108 speedup is thus very misleading.\u201d One side-benefit of all these claims and counter-claims, as Aaronson has most forcefully argued, is that they help us to understand quantum mechanics a little better. Nic Harrigan works at the Centre for Quantum Photonics at Bristol University, a leading research institute in quantum\u00a0mechanics. \u201cAlthough there are incredible potential applications of quantum computing,\u201d Harrigan says, \u201ceven if no one ever builds a useful quantum computer we still learn an immense amount by attempting to. This might sound like ass-covering, but quantum mechanics itself is a theory so fundamental to our understanding of the universe, and is the seed to so many current and future other technologies, that anything we can do to understand it better is huge. Somewhat incredibly it turns out that a good way to try and understand what is actually going on in quantum mechanics (and just how it differs from normal classical physics) is to consider which kind of computational problems one can more easily solve using quantum mechanical\u00a0systems.\u201d At Google they were cautiously optimistic about D-Wave\u2019s usefulness. The head of engineering, Hartmut Neven, outlined the strengths and weaknesses of the tests, and acknowledged that while there were other algorithms that, if deployed on classical computers, could outperform quantum annealing, he expected future developments to favour quantum annealing. \u201cThe design of next-generation annealers must facilitate the embedding of problems of practical relevance,\u201d he said. The kinds of problems that quantum annealing might help address are all concerned with what\u2019s called optimisation \u2013 finding the most efficient model in complex systems.   Related: How cloud computing is becoming more sustainable    \u201cOptimisation sounds like a really boring problem,\u201d says Brownell, \u201cbut it\u2019s at the core of so many complex application problems in every discipline. Probably one of the most exciting is in the artificial intelligence world. Say you\u2019re trying to recognise a water bottle. It still takes computers an enormous amount of time to do that not as well as humans do. Computers\u00a0are catching up, but quantum computing can help\u00a0accelerate that process.\u201d He cites genomics, economics and medicine as other areas that are rich with optimisation problems. With conventional computers, creating complex models \u2013 such as, for example, the Monte Carlo simulation used in the finance industry to analyse different interest rate scenarios \u2013 requires an enormous amount of computing power. And computing power requires real power. \u201cYou go to these big web properties and they have data centres that are installed next to hydroelectric plants because they consume so much electricity,\u201d says Brownell. \u201cThey\u2019re the second-largest consumers of electrical energy on the planet.\u201d D-Wave\u2019s vision, he says, is for a green revolution in computing, in which everyone will have access to much more energy-efficient quantum computers through the cloud. In a few years, he thinks, we\u2019ll be able to access quantum computing from our phones. \u201cI think we have the opportunity to create one of the most valuable technology companies in history,\u201d says Brownell. \u201cI know that sounds really grand, but based on the capability we\u2019ve built, we\u2019re at the stage to be the dominant player in quantum computing for decades to come.\u201d Well, any self-respecting CEO would say that. But it certainly seems that D-Wave are currently leading the\u00a0quantum computer race. Where that race is going, what it involves and how many universes it\u2019s taking place in are, however, questions that we\u2019ll probably need a working quantum computer to answer.",
