  "body": "The BBC journalist Victoria Derbyshire has completed her 10-month treatment for breast cancer, which she documented in a regular diary to help demystify the process. Derbyshire, 47, who was diagnosed with the disease at the end of July 2015, has been filming diaries that kept track of her experiences. On Wednesday, she completed six weeks of radiotherapy, her last major treatment for the cancer. In the latest instalment of the diary, Derbyshire said: \u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday 25 May and I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. That was my last radiotherapy session. Just finished this second. Thirty sessions \u2013 five days a week for the last six weeks \u2013 and it\u2019s finished. Wow, can\u2019t believe it. Gosh. \u201cI am actually happy, despite these tears. And hopefully that is it for cancer treatment for ever, if all goes according to plan.\u201d In the diary, Derbyshire said she experienced an \u201cuncharacteristic wobble\u201d halfway through the radiotherapy treatment. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is completely normal and everyone who\u2019s ever had a cancer diagnosis will think this \u2013 I am thinking about what if this cancer comes back,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, I never want to go through chemotherapy again, ever, I just do not want it to come back ... I just want this to have been a blip and get on with my life, my kids\u2019 life, my partner\u2019s life, my family\u2019s future.\u201d Derbyshire had chemotherapy from November 2015 to February this year, and the radiotherapy treatment was recommended to her after her mastectomy seven months earlier, to reduce the risk of any cancer cells remaining.     A screengrab from Derbyshire\u2019s video diary after her mastectomy. Photograph: BBC    \u201cYou lie on a bed, you put your arms up, you\u2019ve taken your top layer of clothing off and there is a large disc above you which angles,\u201d she explained of the process. \u201cThe radiation beams come from there and target the right hand side of me, the right breast. But you can\u2019t see the beams, they don\u2019t shoot out from this large piece of machinery \u2013 it\u2019s not like Star Wars.\u201d Radiotherapy treatment, which uses high-energy rays to destroy cancerous cells by targeting specific regions of the body, is not available at all hospitals, and Derbyshire had to cover more than 1,000 miles over the period of her treatment, travelling to St Luke\u2019s cancer centre at the Royal Surrey NHS County hospital. \u201cClearly it is an issue for hundreds and hundreds of patients, you can\u2019t always get the bespoke treatment that you need in your local NHS hospital,\u201d she said. She will now have to take the drug tamoxifen daily for the next five to 10 years to prevent the breast cancer from coming back.   \u201cOn 31 July 2015 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. One mastectomy, six sessions of chemotherapy, 30 doses of radiotherapy later, I feel like this could be a fresh start,\u201d Derbyshire said.  \u201cAnd I know not everybody gets that opportunity. I am completely aware of that and so I am very grateful \u2013 exceptionally grateful.  \u201cI want to say to you, if you are going through cancer treatment or you are about to go through cancer treatment: I\u2019m sending you all my love and strength. Take it, have it. You can have it. Please do. And just keep going.  \u201cIt\u2019s time to crack on with the rest of my life.\u201d",
