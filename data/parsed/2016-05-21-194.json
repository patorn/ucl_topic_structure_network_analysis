  "body": "Ministers have given the go-ahead for New-York-style problem-solving courts in which judges review the progress of convicted offenders after sentence with the aim of keeping them out of prison. Such courts \u2013 which often specialise in handling drug or alcohol addiction, domestic abuse and housing cases \u2013 involve imposing non-custodial punishments. Those convicted have to appear regularly before the judge to be assessed.    Related: Looking for better ways to make prison work in the 21st century | Letters    A pilot programme involving a number of courts is already under development and will be formally launched later this year. A joint working group involving judges and Ministry of Justice (MoJ) officials endorsed the scheme and is examining how it can be expanded. Announcing the initiative, the justice minister Caroline Dinenage said she hoped it would provide alternatives to prison for female offenders who are particularly at risk behind bars. The justice secretary, Michael Gove, has expressed enthusiasm for the type of problem-solving courts developed in New York and met some of the US judges who run them. The US tribunals focus on identifying and dealing with each offender\u2019s underlying problems and preventing their re-offending. If they fail to engage with rehabilitiation efforts they can be sent to prison. Gove has pledged to reform prisons without reducing the inmate population but this latest initiative derives from New York judges whose explicit aim is to end America\u2019s enthusiasm for mass incarceration.  Addressing a meeting in the Royal Courts of Justice in London earlier this week, the most senior judge in New York\u2019s state courts, Judge Lippman, said: \u201cIt is up to those who care about the administration of justice to think out of the box to make it happen \u2013 not to be soft on crime or tough on crime but rather to be smart on crime. \u201cWe are grappling with the issues of over-incarceration in New York and around [the US].\u201d Courts, he said, could serve as an agent for change. Imprisonment for six months, he added, increased the chance of reoffending. \u201cSending people to jail may actually harm public safety.\u201d  The lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, attended the meeting, which was held in his court. The MoJ has not revealed how many courts will be involved in the pilot programme nor how much money has been allotted to the scheme. Lippman said investment in problem-solving courts, which involve judges spending longer on each offender, would save money overall by reducing the more expensive bills incurred by keeping inmates locked up.  The initiative will also draw on the experience of the few specialist courts already running in England and Wales such as the family, drug and alcohol courts. Other specialist courts have fallen by the wayside because of lack of official support.  Dinenage said: \u201cOver the coming months, together with the judiciary, we will be developing our plans for the first pilot courts in England and Wales. Criminal behaviour is often driven by underlying problems \u2013 alcohol and drug addiction, for example \u2013 that are not being properly adressed.  \u201cThese problem-solving courts, by looking at each offender as a person to be helped as well as punished, place their underlying problems at the heart of each case.  \u201cJudicial supervision, with appropriate levers and sanctions, becomes key to real change. It\u2019s about turning someone\u2019s life around and making the public safer.\u201d Current re-offending rates are \u201cscandalous\u201d, she said. \u201cFar from being an easy option, problem-solving courts \u2013 like prison reform \u2013 become part of a problem-solving strategy that will benefit the public and keep them safe. That\u2019s why breaking the cycle of reoffending is such a priority for this government. \u201cThe more ideas from the frontline judiciary, the more effective these reforms will be.\u201d  Dinenage, who is also the minister responsible for female prisoners, added: \u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear that the question of women offenders should be looked at very carefully, especially those who are pregnant or with young children, because of the negative effect of a custodial sentence. Problem-solving courts \u2026 may be particularly helpful in diverting women to the services they need.\u201d Phil Bowen, director of the UK\u2019s Centre for Justice Innovation, which has championed New-York-style problem-solving courts, welcomed the government\u2019s commitment. \u201cWe know from research,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a defendant in a problem-solving court is a third less likely to go on to commit more offences than those going through a traditional court. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of seeing the role of courts in this country \u2013 as places offering real opportunity to change people\u2019s behaviour and lives for the better. If done right, the tough-love, practical approach will slot into and strengthen our court systems \u2013 cutting crime and improving public safety.\u201d How problem-solving courts work Last summer the justice secretary, Michael Gove, visited Newark municipal court in New Jersey, where convicted offenders are brought back regularly to have progress on community sentences assessed. The judge can send offenders to prison for failing to comply with rehabilitation orders. Judge Alex Calabrese, who presides over criminal courts in Red Hook, Brooklyn, also met Gove in London last December and explained more about the pioneering US community courts he oversees. The Red Hook court uses an enhanced range of community and social service sentencing options. A proportion of defendants are given medium- or long-term judicially supervised treatment orders for drug addiction, mental illness, or other problems.  The majority of defendants receive short-term social or community service sanctions, typically five days or less in length. The aim is to identify and resolve problems in the community and reduce the number of conventional jail sentences handed down. The first such community court in the US was set up in Manhattan\u2019s midtown area in 1993. It worked with businesses that were losing trade because crime was so disruptive around Times Square.",
