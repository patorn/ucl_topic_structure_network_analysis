  "body": "Eleven-year-old Isla Palmer is crazy about cats, but her mum won\u2019t let her have one because she\u2019s a vet and says the last thing she wants to do is come back to another animal.  One day, when Isla goes with her mum to work, she spots a beautiful black cat in need of a home. When the girl asks her mother if they can have it, she refuses. Isla\u2019s grandma is in the story the whole time and she is the reason they get the cat in the end. But it is not only this cat in need of home, and soon the Palmer\u2019s house is full of them.  This might seem like a dull tale but there was something that kept me wanting to read on, and I think it was the way it\u2019s written. I also like the relationships between the characters \u2013 that\u2019s the most important thing.
