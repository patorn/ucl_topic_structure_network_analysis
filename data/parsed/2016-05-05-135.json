  "body": "Claudio Ranieri has said the acclaim he has enjoyed since Leicester City\u2019s historic Premier League triumph is his reward for years of persistence amid heartache. Until Monday\u2019s confirmation of his first top-flight title as a manager, the Italian had endured several near-misses during his three decades in the dugout, finishing as a runner-up with Chelsea, Roma and Monaco. \u201cI think this is my karma because I fought so hard to achieve all my things \u2013 it has a special flavour,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the beginning I felt something special. Of course I could never imagine this. We worked so hard. I know all the players and all the managers in all the clubs worked so hard but only one wins \u2013 and this year it happened to me.\u201d   Related: Leicester to offer Riyad Mahrez new deal but \u201850/50 chance\u2019 he could leave    Ranieri said his only other achievement that comes close to Leicester\u2019s victory was back in his early days as a manager, when he guided Cagliari from the Italian third flight to survival in Serie A. \u201cThat was my first fairytale and now there is another. To win the Premier League title is special, more in Leicester, more with these fantastic lads.\u201d The 64-year-old described how he had been almost overwhelmed by tributes this week, saying he had so far been unable to respond to most of the messages of congratulations because every time he starts drafting a reply on his phone he is interrupted by several new texts. At Thursday\u2019s press conference he was given a standing ovation by journalists, a reception in stark contrast to the widespread ambivalence that greeted his appointment as Leicester manager last summer. Keenly aware of how quickly perceptions change in football, he quipped that \u201cmy little sharks\u201d \u2013 as he dubs the journalists on the Leicester beat \u2013 will not be slow to criticise him if Leicester\u2019s performances dip, saying it while making a hand gesture mimicking a snappy mouth. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for next season if something goes wrong and you say: \u2018Ha, Ranieri, gnash, gnash, gnash!\u2019\u201d     Claudio Ranieri was all smiles as his greeted the media on Thursday.

That is not good. But I continue to respect. Respect is the most important thing in life. I respect everybody. So if somebody doesn\u2019t respect me, it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d For now, everyone wants to sing songs of praise for Ranieri and Leicester \u2013 including Andrea Bocelli, the top Italian tenor who will perform at the King Power Stadium on Saturday, when Leicester play their last home game of the season, against Everton. \u201cHe called me, I don\u2019t remember, maybe one month or two months ago,\u201d said Ranieri, who has known his compatriot since meeting him backstage at a concert at Wembley several years ago. \u201cHe was happy with what Leicester was doing and said: \u2018I\u2019d like to come to sing something.\u2019 I said: \u2018Why not?\u2019 I gave all my information to the club and they made all the arrangements.\u201d   Related: Robert Huth and Marouane Fellaini charged with violent conduct    Asked whether he felt any temptation to quit while at a barely surpassable high point in his career despite having three years left on his contract, an incredulous Ranieri replied: \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d He said he intended to strengthen Leicester\u2019s squad to try to retain their title next season while competing in the Champions League for the first time in the club\u2019s history but said he would pursue only players with the character to fit in. \u201cI don\u2019t want big names here, I don\u2019t want to break the dressing room,\u201d he said. \u201cMy lads are special. Of course we have to buy some good players but whoever arrives must have the same spirit. All the time I said to my players it\u2019s not important the name of the opponent or the club, we prepare and we fight. I want to continue with this philosophy. We want to grow up together.\u201d Jamie Vardy will return from suspension to face Everton but Robert Huth will miss out after being suspended for three matches for violent conduct following his clash with Marouane Fellaini at Old Trafford last Sunday. Danny Drinkwater was sent off in that game for two bookable offences so must also sit out the Everton match but Ranieri hinted that Matty James may be given a poignant first appearance of the season after recovering from the knee injury that has prevented him from taking part in the campaign so far.",
