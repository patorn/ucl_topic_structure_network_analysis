  "body": "Former Friends star Matt LeBlanc has described claims he is at war with his Top Gear co-presenter Chris Evans as a \u201cbig load of bullshit\u201d and hit out at the \u201cruthlessness\u201d of the British press. The new-look show will return to BBC2 on Sunday amid reports that the two stars do not get on and a sometimes troubled production which has seen senior executives depart and a hasty apology after LeBlanc was filmed doing \u201cdoughnuts\u201d near London\u2019s Cenotaph.   Related: Top Gear's big studio audience told to forget how show used to look    \u201cAll this stuff that Chris and I are at war with each other is a big load of bullshit. We\u2019ve never had a rift,\u201d LeBlanc told the new issue of Radio Times. \u201cI\u2019m a true car fan, Chris is a true car fan. We\u2019re hanging out, having a laugh, doing our best. He is an extremely smart guy. I\u2019d beat him in a race, though \u2013 and you can tell him I said that.\u201d  Hired by the BBC to co-present the show with Evans following Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s axing last year, LeBlanc said: \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate the ruthlessness of the British press.  \u201cI know it\u2019s a big show but hey, we\u2019re not cowboys, it\u2019s all meticulously planned, permission granted, in writing. \u201cI didn\u2019t fire those guys [Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May]. I\u2019ve met them. They\u2019re nice guys. I\u2019ll watch their new show. I wasn\u2019t there when any of it went down. It\u2019s not my fault they\u2019re gone. I didn\u2019t put a gun in anyone\u2019s mouth.\u201d Evans has also come in for criticism, with the star recently hitting out at the \u201cweasels\u201d and \u201cmalcontents\u201d who he said wanted to see the show fail. Speaking about an incident in which he was sick after one high-speed journey with motor racing driver Sabine Schmitz, Evans said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been driven around at really high speeds but when you are, it\u2019s difficult.  \u201cI was sick. The next week a Top Gun pilot was sick as well, so I\u2019m in good company.\u201d Evans said he would have had to give up TV if he had turned down the opportunity to present Top Gear.           Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc in trailer for revamped Top Gear    \u201cWhen I got the call last summer, I took half an hour to think about it before I said yes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest TV show in the world, watched by 350 million people, the most illegally downloaded show on the planet. I couldn\u2019t say no really. Well, if I had, it would have meant giving up on making TV programmes.\u201d  Of his co-presenter LeBlanc, Evans said: \u201cMatt is a brilliant driver. Really on it, gung ho. I love cars, but I\u2019ve never raced. I\u2019ve gone over 200mph, but for me cars are more about the aesthetic. Matt can take an engine to pieces and put it back together again blindfolded. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cChris is more about the aura of cars, the mystique,\u201d said LeBlanc. \u201cI\u2019m more technical. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by how these inanimate objects harness this explosion. The internal combustion engine is an amazing thing. Plus, I inject comedy. That\u2019s my background. I\u2019m always pitching jokes.\u201d LeBlanc added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend I do all my own stunts. I do as much as I\u2019m comfortable with. When it gets really crazy, I have a stunt driver. That\u2019s no secret. Insurance companies are involved. If something calls for real precision driving, I let someone else do it.\u201d The show\u2019s popular Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment will be replaced with Star in a Rallycross Car, which will feature a new car and a new track.  Clarkson will reunite with his former Top Gear colleagues, May and Hammond, for a new show on Amazon Prime, The Grand Tour, after the trio signed a reported \u00a3160m deal with the US on-demand service.",
