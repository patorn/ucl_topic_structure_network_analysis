  "body": "The federal race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, has welcomed a plan by the Victorian government to trial blind recruiting for public service positions to overcome racial bias. The Recruit Smarter trial will see 29 public and private organisations, including state government departments, Victoria Police, Melbourne University and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, take part in an 18-month pilot program to assess which details should be stripped from a person\u2019s initial job application to ensure a more equitable selection process.  The resulting resumes could be de-identified in terms of the name, gender, age and location of the applicant. Soutphommasane, who has spoken before about what he called the \u201cbamboo ceiling\u201d, said racial discrimination did occur in employment and recruitment in Australia, often as the result of unconscious bias on behalf of the recruiter.   Related: Stan Grant's speech on racism and the Australian dream goes viral    \u201cThere is increasing awareness of unconscious bias \u2013 not only with gender but also cultural diversity,\u201d he said in a statement to Guardian Australia. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot more to be done. This includes ensuring our cultural diversity is better represented in positions of leadership within organisations.\u201d Soutphommasane said he was looking forward to the results of the trial. Robin Scott, the multicultural affairs minister in the Andrews government, said the trial was a personal issue for him because he had watched his wife, Wu Shaojie, struggle to get an interview when applying for jobs. \u201cWhen she anglicised her name to Jade and used my surname there was an instantaneous change in the response and she was much more successful in the job application process, and I think this just brings home that this is real, this is the lived experience of many people in Victoria and Australia,\u201d he said. A study by the Australian National University in 2010 into the callback rates for job applicants of names from various cultural backgrounds found \u201cclear evidence of discrimination\u201d in the selection process. Most affected were people from Middle Eastern and Chinese backgrounds, who according to the study had to submit 50% more applications to receive the same number of callbacks as someone with an Anglo-Saxon sounding name.  Scott said his wife\u2019s experience brought that research home to him.  \u201cI\u2019m determined that less people face the sort of challenges that she faced. Should people have to change their name, should people have to address their own identity when they are seeking work? I think the answer to that is no.\u201d Professor Alison Booth, one of the authors of the ANU study, said the trial was a good first step but would only remove one layer of discrimination. To affect change throughout the organisation, she said, it would need to be coupled with training. \u201cOnce you get those all those people going in for the interview, it\u2019s still possible that their could be internalised and entrenched biases at work,\u201d she said. \u201cAll that you could hope for is well-trained interviewers to ensure the process is fair.\u201d Booth said blind recruiting could not be applied for progression within an organisation, unless it was was large enough to have many internal applicants going for the same promotion.  Jennifer Whelan, managing director of the diversity and inclusion specialist Psynapse,  said the trial was an \u201cexcellent initiative\u201d but that in order to generate lasting change organisations needed to become more diverse at the leadership level. \u201cEven if you get good representation at entry levels it doesn\u2019t fix the problem that the higher up you go, in pretty much any industry, the more homogenous it becomes.\u201d The full list of organisations taking part in the trial involved can be found here.",
