  "body": "The Flint water crisis was a \u201ctragedy that never should have happened\u201d in the US, Barack Obama said Wednesday during his first visit to the city since evidence of lead contamination emerged last fall, while residents jeered Michigan\u2019s governor in his first public remarks before the community. \u201cFlint\u2019s recovery is everybody\u2019s responsibility,\u201d the president told a crowd of 1,000 gathered inside a high school gymnasium. \u201cAnd I will make sure that responsibility is met.\u201d The president focused his remarks on what he called a \u201ccorrosive\u201d mentality in politics that \u201ccontributed to this crisis\u201d. \u201cNow, I do not believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is not the place to sort out every screwup \u2026 but I do think there\u2019s a larger issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset that believes the less government is the highest good no matter what,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an \u2026 ideology that undervalues the common good, says we\u2019re all on our own.\u201d The president\u2019s trip included a discussion with nine residents and a local pediatrician, Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha, who last fall uncovered elevated blood lead levels in Flint children. \u201cI told them that I understood why you\u2019re afraid, not just for yourself but for your kids,\u201d Obama said during his 50-minute speech. \u201cI also want to come here to tell you that: I\u2019ve got your back; that we\u2019re paying attention.\u201d The president\u2019s visit also ushered in the first public remarks to Flint residents from Michigan governor Rick Snyder since he conceded the city\u2019s water was contaminated seven months ago. From the moment Snyder stepped on stage, attendees booed and jeered the second-term Republican governor, who won the state gubernatorial race in 2010 without ever serving public office. As he has in recent months, the governor apologized for his administration\u2019s role in the crisis \u2013 but his remarks were brief. The former venture capitalist could barely get a word in without an interruption. \u201cYou didn\u2019t create this problem,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cGovernment failed you.\u201d Attendees countered back: \u201cYou did!\u201d     A local resident of Flint yells \u2018Get out of here\u2019 as Rick Snyder speaks. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images    Moments later, by contrast, Flint\u2019s congressional representative, Dan Kildee, received rapturous applause from the room. \u201cThis looks like Flint,\u201d he said. Kildee criticized the efforts of emergency managers in the city who \u201cmade choices that had more to do with dollars and cents\u201d than with the health of residents. Snyder appointed a string of emergency managers between 2011 and 2015 to run Flint, essentially stripping the city\u2019s elected mayor and city council of power. In April 2014, as a cost-saving measure, the city switched its drinking water source from Lake Huron to the corrosive Flint river. State environmental officials didn\u2019t require Flint to treat the river water, which allowed lead to leach off pipes before flowing into households across the city. A Snyder-appointed taskforce found that concerns raised about the river at the time \u201cshould have resulted ... in a full and comprehensive review of the water situation in Flint\u201d. Kildee said there is an \u201cobsession\u201d with austerity in government. \u201cWe shrunk government to a point it wasn\u2019t even in a position \u2026 to defend its own people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s wrong.\u201d Obama echoed Kildee\u2019s remarks, saying austerity measures lead to \u201csystemic neglect\u201d that diminishes \u201cthe life of a community and make it harder for our young people to succeed\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not just enough to fix the water,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix the culture of neglect.\u201d    It\u2019s not just enough to fix the water. We\u2019ve got to fix the culture of neglect  Barack Obama      At a stop at a food bank earlier on Wednesday, Obama drank from a glass of filtered Flint water, in an attempt to encourage residents to drink filtered water. \u201cIf you\u2019re using a filter \u2026 then Flint water at this point is drinkable,\u201d Obama said, cautioning, however, that pregnant women and children younger than six should continue using bottled water. Residents have expressed the overreliance on bottled water, out of safety, has become an unnerving reality in the city. But, as a short-term measure, Obama said using filtered tap water is the \u201cright thing to do\u201d. \u201cAnd, frankly, it\u2019s going to be a lot more convenient than people traveling long distances to try to lug back a bunch of bottled water,\u201d he said. The president said Flint should still push forward with an effort spearheaded by Flint mayor Karen Weaver to remove lead service lines across the city. Weaver has estimated the city needs $55m to complete pipe replacement, and only about $2m has been appropriated for the effort so far \u2013 enough to remove roughly 500 lines in a city estimated to have about 15,000. \u201cThat may be a long-term process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may take a year, it may take two years. \u2026 In the meantime, folks have to be able to use water.\u201d Obama told reporters after the briefing that Flint parents should have their kids tested for lead exposure and said, with proactive measures, long-term health effects of lead can be reigned in.

It will then be retested after that.\u201d Weaver said she was encouraged to know that Obama is concerned about the \u201cman-made\u201d water disaster. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve what happened here,\u201d she said before Obama took the stage. \u201cBut we do deserve the resources to fix it.\u201d The president\u2019s visit was prompted by a letter from an eight-year-old Flint resident. Mari Copeny, who is known around the city as Little Miss Flint. Copeny urged Obama in her letter to meet with the community, as it would \u201creally lift people\u2019s spirits\u201d. He also met with Flint residents in a community roundtable prior to delivering his remarks at the high school. \u201cI am confident that Flint will come back,\u201d Obama said. The president highlighted federal remediation efforts in Flint ahead of Wednesday\u2019s speech, saying Obama has directed an \u201call-out\u201d response to address the city\u2019s water crisis: federal aid, prompted by an emergency declaration issued in January, has provided over 9m liters of water, along with 50,000 filters for Flint residents, according to the White House. Obama green-lighted an expansion of Medicaid coverage in the city for 14,000 children and 1,000 pregnant women. Snyder said on Tuesday that Flint residents would be available for the expansion next week. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been authorized to continue providing water, filters, and water test kits through mid-August, the White House said. Snyder, whose aides first learned of concerns over lead contamination, publicly conceded last October that Flint residents had been exposed to high levels of lead. The governor, however, has sought to distance himself from criticism for his months-long delay in launching a widespread response. Nearly $70m is being appropriated by the state legislature to reconnect Flint with Detroit\u2019s water system, begin testing for lead, and provide bottled water to residents. Snyder activated the national guard to assist, and has proposed an additional $165m for further measures. With 40% of the majority-black city living below the poverty line, however, residents say there\u2019s still a disconnect between the needs of Flint\u2019s 100,000 residents. The family of Copeny has endured a series of irritating skin rashes, even after Flint began pulling water again from Lake Huron last fall, her mother said this week. Lead isn\u2019t a known cause for skin irritation, but state officials, along with assistance from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have continued to investigate what causes the rashes. Earlier, students and residents lined the road outside Northwestern, where organizers of a recall petition for Snyder gathered signatures. Nearly halfway through Obama\u2019s speech, the president broke out with a momentary cough, prompting a light-hearted moment, when he asked to applause: \u201cI\u2019m gonna get a glass of water.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we find one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be filtered.\u201d",
