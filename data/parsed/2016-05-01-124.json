  "body": "\u201cI started photographing megachurches as an oppositional idea,\u201d explains Lisa Anne Auerbach, a California photographer and artist. \u201cI had been doing a series about small freestanding businesses [encapsulating] this idea of America: you\u2019re an individual, you hang up your shingle, you pick yourself up by your bootstrap, and become your own fantasy. I was thinking about megachurches being another part of the American dream \u2013 faith and family and community.\u201d Using a database published by Hartford Seminary, a theological college  in Connecticut, Auerbach catalogued megachurches \u2013 \u201cand I use their definition for this\u201d, she stresses \u2013 in Protestant denominations, which claim to have weekly congregations of over 2,000 people. Auerbach also subscribed to Outreach magazine, a publication aimed at those who run churches, which has listings of megachurches. The top 50 in the country have more than 10,000 worshippers a week.     New Spring church in Anderson, South Carolina. Photograph: Lisa Anne Auerbach    Auerbach\u2019s project was driven by her bafflement at America\u2019s evangelical Christian demographic. \u201cWe hear about America being 90% Christian, or some crazy number, and as an artist living in Los Angeles, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m in touch with at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI had been reading about megachurches in the press, mostly in relationship to politics, and thinking: who are these people that are going to these places, that are buying this conservative agenda?\u201d  With anthropological curiosity, Auerbach started exploring the phenomenon in proximity to her home, but always brought her camera when travelling elsewhere. So far, she has photographed megachurches in Florida, Arizona, Michigan, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and California. Initially planning to make big prints of the megachurches, she reasoned: \u201cIf you walk into a room full of them, it\u2019s going to look like a recruitment \u2013 the opposite of what I wanted.\u201d So she decided to make a jumbo zine, which she dubs a \u201cmegazine\u201d, scaling up the traditional half-letter-size format to 60in. She has made three such megazines in total: one on psychics, two on megachurches.     Sa-Rang community church in Anaheim, California. Photograph: Lisa Anne Auerbach    Auerbach\u2019s megachurch megazine is currently on view in a Paris exhibition called Wasteland: New Art from Los Angeles, a reference to the famed TS Eliot poem. The relationship between architecture, landscape and religion seems particularly strange from a European perspective. The conception of the cathedral is not only where one goes to be spiritual or commune with God, but to feel awe through the grandeur of the architecture and the building\u2019s history. Comparatively, the US megachurch buildings are stripped wholesale of that sense of wonder and connection to the past; they are also far from the focal point of a city.  \u201cNotre Dame is a cathedral in the center of the city,\u201d says Auerbach. \u201cWhereas these churches, although they\u2019re very powerful, are hidden. The reason they\u2019re hidden, I found, is that they\u2019re camouflaged. They look like places we just drive by. They\u2019re in office parks; they\u2019re in former big box stores. I thought that was fascinating: I don\u2019t even know what to look for. That was the impetus to say: what is this thing?\u201d     Central Christian church in Mesa, Arizona. Photograph: Lisa Anne Auerbach    In tandem with the photographs, Auerbach provides statistics on purported congregation size and denomination, as well as church location and name. Some nomenclature is so fanciful as to seem fabricated (or at least worthy of the Onion): Love International Ministries, Potential Church, Life Changers International, Pilgrim Rest.  Auerbach jotted down personal anecdotes about her experience, to \u201cflesh out the photographs a little bit\u201d. She noted bad puns, such as \u201cthou shalt not park here\u201d signs in a lot, and a church coffee shop called He Brews. She observed that the sign reading \u201cchapel\u201d was the exact dimension and typeface as the one adjacently announcing \u201crestrooms\u201d. She noticed a mosaic cross juxtaposed directly above a garbage can, and a church parking lot \u201csuspiciously filled with single men sitting in their cars and pickup trucks\u201d. Encountering an outdoor baptismal tub, she wondered if people ever repurposed it for a refreshing summer dip (\u201cIf you\u2019re already baptized, can you do it just to cool down?\u201d) She stumbled on a drive-through prayer center in Arizona, where members \u201cprayed for my photo project while I took the photo\u201d.     Brookwood church in Simpsonville, South Carolina. Photograph: Lisa Anne Auerbach    The images are characterized by an acute eeriness \u2013 Auerbach purposefully photographed the spaces on weekdays, while more or less vacant. \u201cI don\u2019t want the presence of people to get in the way of looking at the space,\u201d she says. Auerbach also provides field notes about the church\u2019s accessibility (or lack thereof), who was lurking and the general vicinity: billboards, furniture stores, McDonald\u2019s, minimarts, mega-mansions, grim apartment buildings, soccer fields, freeways and expressways.  From the outset, Auerbach\u2019s mission was above all a visual one. Her photographic influences \u2013 William Christenberry, Walker Evans, Lewis Baltz, (\u201call the New Topographics stuff\u201d) \u2013 are apparent: like them, she provides a matter-of-fact look at the commonplace American landscape. \u201cI wanted them to be traditionally beautiful photos, despite being weird,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI knew these places are around, but I was like: have I seen them? Would I recognize them? Is it part of my commute and I don\u2019t acknowledge it, because I don\u2019t know what to look for? It came from curiosity.\u201d      Victory Christian Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Photograph: Lisa Anne Auerbach    Her descriptions of the churches she encountered range from funny to uneasy. She finds edifices evocative of a hospital, greenhouse, plastic toy, warehouse, Old West movie set, bunker and low brown turtle. Recurring adjectives include bland, industrial, sterile and Disney-like; materials include stucco, tile, stone, concrete, cinder block and unsightly brick. The drab architecture reflects the monolithic nature of church theologies: \u201cUnlike the small businesses, which felt very individualistic, and about creating your own world view, the church felt more about power, about converting people, so they could have wealth.\u201d The featureless buildings concealed in plain sight indicate the way evangelical America works: disguised within the quotidian landscape, pumping commercial spaces with pious significance. \u201cWHERE WILL YOU SPEND ETERNITY?\u201d one of the photographed places of worship challenges ominously. It\u2019s a loaded question for something just off the expressway.     The Rock in Anaheim, California. Photograph: Lisa Anne Auerbach    In the context of the election and the fever pitch of conservative voices, the project takes on added resonance \u2013 on an electoral level as well as an anthropological one. Auerbach says: \u201cI started photographing soon after the 2008 election, because I started reading about how megachurch members were determining polls in various places. It\u2019s against the law for churches to promote candidates, but they preach around that, as closely as they can.\u201d Auerbach is thinking of driving across the country during the upcoming national election, but admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can handle it.\u201d She is thinking of making a megazine about cats instead.",
