  "body": "On April Fools\u2019 Day 2014, Kudra Falla-Ricketts, then 16, was getting ready for school. Her mood was low. All she could think about was the protest in Bentley, a farming community west of Lismore, against drilling for coal seam gas. She wanted to be with her community at the front line of the Northern Rivers\u2019 resistance.  Instead, armed with her computer, the Metgasco mining company logo and her school email address, Falla-Ricketts composed a prank media release that announced the company was pulling out of the Northern Rivers. \u201cIt was kind of spur of the moment,\u201d Falla-Ricketts said. \u201cWithin an hour of thinking of it, it was done.\u201d  At school she was called to the principal\u2019s office and suspended for misuse of her school email account. Falla-Ricketts was secretly delighted with the unexpected opportunity to spend more time at Bentley. She navigated the ensuing media storm and managed to promote national awareness about Bentley and the risks of CSG.

Her party is hoping to capitalise on her local popularity and the strong anti-CSG sentiment in the community. The chances of her being elected are remote \u2013 the Greens won only 6% of first-preference votes in 2013, well behind the Nationals\u2019 Kevin Hogan, who narrowly beat the incumbent, Labor\u2019s Janelle Saffin. Both are standing again.  The Greens hope to make some inroads. At the 2015 New South Wales state elections of 2015, the Greens came a close second to the Nationals in Lismore, which is part of the Page federal electoral district.      Falla-Ricketts grew up in an atmosphere imbued with rallies, actions and awareness about climate change. Her father, Aidan Ricketts, the well-known activist, educator and author of The Activist\u2019s Handbook, has been an influential figure in her life. Falla-Ricketts acknowledges her self-confidence derives from the encouragement he provides. But her father takes little credit for her determination and drive. \u201cThese are not things she is pushed to do,\u201d Ricketts said. \u201cIn more recent years, she has availed herself of every opportunity for training in leadership.\u201d Falla-Ricketts has been a member of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and a participant in the YMCA Youth Parliament, speaking about transgender discrimination. While Falla-Ricketts said the direction of Green preferences had not yet been decided, her personal choice was evident, describing Saffin as a \u201cbeautiful\u201d person and being supportive of her record as an MP.   For now, Falla-Ricketts\u2019 focus is on listening to the electorate and encouraging young people to have their say. She says the main issues in Page are education funding, affordable housing, keeping TAFE open and accessible, developing meaningful employment opportunities and environmental protection. \u201cI\u2019m really someone that needs to be working on something, to help the environment, or the world, or I don\u2019t feel fulfilled.\u201d A version of this story has also been published on UniPollWatch, Australia\u2019s biggest student journalism project.
