  "body": "The Australian actor and comedian Rebel Wilson is suing the magazine publisher Bauer Media over articles that Wilson claims were defamatory, damaged her reputation, humiliated her and impacted her career.  In May 2015 Woman\u2019s Day published two articles \u2013 one in print and one online \u2013 that claimed the actor had lied about her age, name and background, and had fabricated stories from her childhood.  The claims were picked up by national and international press and published in subsequent articles in Bauer titles the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly, OK Magazine and New Weekly. At the time, Wilson tweeted that it was evidence of \u201ctall poppy syndrome\u201d.    OMG I'm actually a 100 year old mermaid formerly known as \"CC Chalice\" ....thanks shady Australian press for your tall poppy syndrome x\u2014 Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson) May 18, 2015    In a writ filed to the Victorian supreme court on Monday, Wilson said she was not contacted before the articles were published and that they had been timed to coincide with the release of Wilson\u2019s film Pitch Perfect 2 in order \u201cto attract public and media attention within Australia and internationally\u201d.  The writ said the articles made her out to be a \u201cserial liar who has invented fantastic stories in order to make it in Hollywood\u201d and claimed it took the publications a year to remove the articles, after Wilson had supplied them with evidence that she had never lied about her name, and requested an apology on 20 May 2015.

She's paid to pretend to be someone else | Van Badham    The writ states that following each article, Wilson had \u201cbeen gravely injured in her feelings, credit and reputation, has been humiliated and embarrassed and has suffered loss and damage\u201d. She is also suing for special damages, claiming she was removed from some roles and missed out on others because of the articles. Wilson spoke about the fabrication claims in a November issue of Who magazine: \u201cBeing an actress it affects women more than men in terms of ageism and sexism, so to be called out by the press on something most sensible, business-minded people would have done in my position, it was a bit hurtful,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an actor, you have what\u2019s called a playing range; to me, it\u2019s not really beneficial having your age written anyway.\u201d Wilson also discussed the controversy during an episode of the ABC program Home Delivery with Julia Zemiro in February. \u201cI think, when I did go to America, I kind of just stopped saying my age,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s Hollywood; come on, people! \u201cThe reality is, when you work in America, you have to show your passport and your visa for every single job, so it\u2019s not like you can hide how old you are.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Wilson has accused Bauer Media of wrongdoing. In February the actor claimed an ACP Magazines journalist had harassed her ill grandmother: \u201cFor a \u2018journalist\u2019 to harass and verbally abuse her, leaving her scared, is totally wrong,\u201d she wrote.  Bauer Media said the person identified by Wilson was not working for them \u201cin any capacity\u201d \u2013 and that an earlier tweet, identifying the wrong Bauer journalist, had left that journalist \u201cdistressed\u201d.  Bauer Media declined to comment on the defamation allegations. They are yet to be served the writ.",
