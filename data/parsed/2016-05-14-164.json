Those concerned that they might have to get up to speed with that series\u2019 labyrinthine backstory, fear not: this is not a spinoff, nor a tie-in, but a completely new serialised drama. Alice Isn\u2019t Dead tells the story of a truck driver searching for her presumed-dead wife, and experiencing much enigmatic spookiness along the way. The bad news is that you can\u2019t just jump in; you have to go back and listen from the beginning. The good news is that the episodes are only 20 minutes long, so you\u2019ll catch up in no time. And you really should. SH See also: The Black Tapes \u2013 a horror podcast to keep you up at night. You Must Remember This The podcast that dishes the dirt on old-world Hollywood This secret history of Hollywood podcast doubled its listenership with a special on the Charles Manson murders. But narrator Karina Longworth, a former film critic with an appetite for meticulous research and an LA purr, is just as compelling on Frank Sinatra\u2019s weird space foray or the troubled life of 30s bombshell Frances Farmer. It\u2019s a film podcast that actually feels cinematic, with crackly clips and incidental music. Like attending the ultimate starry cocktail party. BT See also: Lore \u2013 true tales from the twisted side of history.   Related: Listen To This: Another Round podcast changes the world one drink at a time    Another Round The podcast for those who love a drink... or 10 Even though the worst thing in the universe is to be sober around drunk people, Buzzfeed\u2019s Another Round podcast somehow manages to feel inclusive. Its gimmick is extraordinarily flimsy \u2013 Tracy Clayton and Heben Nigatu (pictured, left)talk to each other and drink \u2013 and yet their conversations, on everything from racial politics to how to pronounce posh British actors\u2019 names, manage to be both earnest and wide-ranging. Hamilton\u2019s Lin-Manuel Miranda pops up for one brilliantly freewheeling episode. Bim Adewunmi, formerly of this parish, turns up in another. Better than it sounds, honest. SH See also: Tom And Lorenzo\u2019s Pop Style Opinionfest \u2013 the fashion gurus and Mad Men superfans tackle all things cultural and sartorial. Athletico Mince The football podcast for people who don\u2019t like football      A new entrant in the overstuffed \u201ctwo blokes ramble on about whatever\u201d genre. It has an unfair advantage: one of the blokes is Bob Mortimer, of Vic and Bob fame. He talks with humorist Andy \u201cGet in the Sea\u201d Dawson in a show where the promise of \u201cat least 8% football content\u201d is more likely to refer to Raheem Sterling\u2019s home cinema or Leighton Baines\u2019s tiny shorts than the merits of a double-pivot midfield. It\u2019s 98% funnier than regular footy bantz. JS See also: Second Captains \u2013 this one is sporty, but the Irish Times crew play for laughs. The Allusionist The vitally verbose pod for those in love with words If you\u2019re bored of language, you\u2019re bored of life. At least that\u2019s how it feels listening to comedian and etymology enthusiast Helen Zaltzman, who you might know from her other podcast Answer Me This. This fortnightly series is all about words, from the 5,000-year history of the emoji to the smallest language in the world. She chats with experts from crime reporters and CBT therapists to her brother, standup Andy Zaltzman. The Detonating The C-Bomb episode has proved predictably popular, while one titled Post-Love finds listeners sharing their worst breakup lines. Imagine Dictionary Corner playing the Edinburgh festival fringe. BT See also: No Such Thing As A Fish \u2013 QI researchers comb the news. A TV spinoff starts Friday 20 May on BBC2. Death, Sex & Money The podcast that asks life\u2019s difficult questions Anna Sale\u2019s interview-led podcast tackles the \u201cbig questions and hard choices that are often left out of polite conversation\u201d, all of which feature at least one of the three magic words in the show\u2019s title. So we hear from the former NFL player who has fallen out of love with the sport, the Sesame Street star battling memories of her own childhood and the sex worker trying to support her family. Sale is a fine interviewer, warm and empathetic but always willing to push forward with questions that some might leave unasked. GM See also: Love And Radio \u2013 stories and interviews that pack a punch. The Comedian\u2019s Comedian The podcast that stands up for standups Comedian Stuart Goldsmith\u2019s career has been given a boost by this nerdy yet inclusive podcast. Exploring the intricacies of standup, from writing methods to internal struggles, what might come across as a specialist series turns out to be an education in creativity that even outsiders will enjoy. Goldsmith\u2019s forensic interview style often prompts fascinatingly raw responses \u2013 Tony Law\u2019s drunken joyride of an interview is an agonising/enthralling listen. Both a great way of learning what drives major-league acts (Jimmy Carr, David Cross et al) and a an introduction to comics unnoticed by the mainstream. HG See also: The Fear \u2013 funny types discuss their darkest terrors. The Mysterious Secrets Of Uncle Bertie\u2019s Botanarium The period comedy pod by half of Flight Of The Conchords     Jemaine Clement. Photograph: Rob Kim/Getty    \u201cI shall prove that Heaven\u2019s Clover exists. But first, I shall give each and every botanist in here a good thrashing!\u201d This Kiwi period comedy has Jemaine Clement as Lord Joseph Banks, a \u201csquillionaire\u201d berk who sets sail from the Gravy Isles on a quest to prove his mad-scientist uncle (also Clement) right. A gag-packed script \u2013 think Jules Verne redone by Yonderland \u2013 is finessed with lavish production and great music. Sumptuous. JS See also: Me1 Vs Me2 Snooker \u2013 Richard Herring takes himself on in an endless tournament.   Related: Longform: the podcast about writing that uncovers the story behind the headlines    Longform  The podcast that offers up an inside scoop on the big stories  A weekly spinoff from journalism curation site Longform, this pod lines up in-depth conversations with non-fiction writers that go deeper than your average interview. Statistician Nate Silver discusses his shift from analysing baseball to US presidential campaigns, foreign correspondent Kelly McEvers gives an insight into the life of the war reporter, and Adrian Chen talks about his New York Times profile on Megan Phelps-Roper, former member of the virulently homophobic Westboro Baptist Church. LP See also: EyePlayer \u2013 Private Eye\u2019s droll take on major media stories. Criminal The crime podcast for when you\u2019re waiting for more Serial Tales of true crime, once banished to a shelf at the back of WH Smith, are flourishing online. Criminal approaches the genre from a thoughtful angle, privileging curious tales and quirks of jurisprudence over anything overly grisly. In an episode titled The Finger, host Phoebe Judge interviews a man defending his legal right to flip off the cops, while Jolly Jane is the tale of a nurse operating in 19th-century Boston who eased her patients to an early death via an injection of morphine. Cheerful stuff! LP See also: Sword And Scale \u2013 stories of small-town serial killers, Japanese cannibals and more. The Adam Buxton Podcast The podcast from the top dog of homespun offbeat chat     Adam Buxton. Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose    The master of offbeat wit infused with a humble, home-made quality, Dr Buckles transfers his skills into a new, interview-based podcast. Centred on in-depth conversations \u2013 referred to here as \u201cramble chats\u201d \u2013 Buxton teases out personal stories and smart observations from the likes of Caitlin Moran and Louis Theroux. Often its most poignant moments arise from Buxton\u2019s intimate admissions on everything from dealing with grief to his dog, Rosie. Worth a five-star rating for the DIY jingles alone. HG See also: Distraction Pieces \u2013 rapper Scroobius Pip chats amiably to artists, authors and activists. Strangeness In Space The podcast that sends kids\u2019 TV favourites into orbit  Daft sci-fi comedy for all the family, starring Trev and Simon from Saturday morning kids\u2019 TV of yore. Pink Custard, an 80s synthpop duo, are blasted into space by mistake. Cue silly songs rhyming \u201candroid\u201d with \u201coverjoyed\u201d, delivered in a Pet Shop Boys style, puns that will make seven-year-olds\u2019 giggles rain down, and gags about pop, space and sandals. So far only three episodes are on iTunes \u2013 each one is crowdfunded and when they reach their total, they make another \u2013 so treat yourself to the lot. HV See also: Hello From The Magic Tavern \u2013 surreal chat straight outta a portal behind Burger King. Call Your Girlfriend The podcast celebrating frank and funny female friendships \u201cA podcast for long-distance besties everywhere\u201d brings together Ann Freidman and Aminatou Sow for smart talk laced with menstruation, Gossip Girl and Ivanka Trump. It\u2019s a proper lady coven, run completely by women, with the inevitable quick-fire one-liners that ensue. Start with episode 35: The Saddest Hello Since Lionel Richie, where the duo come out as Bieber sympathisers, discuss Drake\u2019s penis muscles and wonder how Adele can be so sad when she\u2019s dating a \u201chot bear\u201d. HV See also: Guys We Fucked \u2013 unabashed and hilarious convos about female sexuality. The best podcasts\u2026 for comedy     Andy Zaltzman and John Oliver. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    The Bugle Now a monthly missive due to co-host John Oliver\u2019s other, rather more lucrative gig, his and Andy Zaltzman\u2019s satirical podcast is still the sharpest around. Comedy Bang! Bang! Scott Aukerman\u2019s ensemble comedy pod is still the biggest and best of its kind 400 episodes in, and its sketch show TV spinoff is worth a watch, too. My Dad Wrote A Porno Jamie Morton reads chapters from his father\u2019s hilariously clunky erotic novel, while mates Alice Levine and James Cooper chuckle heartily. Mouth Time! Courtesy of Reductress, the Onion-style parody of women\u2019s mags and blogs, comes a silly and savage takedown of chatty lifestyle podcasts. Call Chelsea Peretti The Brooklyn Nine-Nine star does verbal battle with comics and bemused members of the public in this send-up of phone-in shows. The best podcasts\u2026 for brain food      Donald Trump. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty    Slate Trumpcast Slate\u2019s political pod looks at the conditions that brought about The Donald. The podcast will only stop when \u2013 or if \u2013 Trump fails in his unlikely bid to be president. Invisibilia An NPR series that sees Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller explore the imperceptible internal details that govern our behaviour, with fascinating results. The Urbanist Scoff all you like at those chaps at Monocle (right), but their podcast on the future of cities is never less than enlightening. Planet Money This economics \u2019cast from the This American Life team explains both boom and bust with wit and clarity.  The Memory Palace Nate DiMeo\u2019s short historical podcast tells long-forgotten yet never less than illuminating stories from our collective past.  The best podcasts\u2026 you\u2019ve already heard of      Marc Maron. Photograph: Getty    WTF With Marc Maron Maron\u2019s comedy confessional has had a big 12 months, with President Obama among the famous types visiting the WTF garage.   Related: Listen to this: Louis CK and Julia Louis Dreyfus visit Marc Maron's WTF podcast    This American Life Podcasting\u2019s first breakout hit, Ira Glass\u2019s series remains a masterclass in long- and short-form narrative, as 2015\u2019s school segregation eps showed. Radiolab Covering everything from science to philosophy, the WYNC series remains a beguiling exploration of both sound and storytelling. Serial OK, the most recent run wasn\u2019t as compelling as season one\u2019s tale of Adnan Syed, but Sarah Koenig\u2019s true-crime pod is still engrossing. Desert Island Discs The long-running Radio 4 show\u2019s archive , stretching back to the middle of the last century, is the pick of the Beeb\u2019s extensive podcast selection. The best\u2026 of the rest     Iggy Pop Photograph: Rebecca Sapp/WireImage    Song Exploder Musicians such as Iggy Pop and Carly Rae Jepson dissect what makes their tunes tick. Melanin Millennials Lively show tackling the under-representation of women of colour in the UK media. The Sporkful A food \u2019cast that devours both haute and not-so-haute cuisine, from gyoza to doughnuts. Fruit YouTube star Issa Rae shares a fictional saga about an American jock\u2019s sexual awakening.  Reply All The baffling world of internet culture is broken down in this engaging pod.  Mystery Show Starlee Kine solves small-scale conundrums like \u201cHow tall is Jake Gyllenhaal?\u201d.  How Did This Get Made? Rubbish films are savaged by comedians. Nic Cage features a lot.  The Odditorium Dr Bramwell and friends highlight cultural curios.  Sampler Our list of top pods not enough for you? Here\u2019s a podcast about other podcasts.  The podcasters\u2019 picks     Josie Long. Photograph: Sarah Lee    Josie Long \u2013 The Beef and Dairy Network podcast \u201cIt\u2019s odd, incredibly funny and the production values are wonderful. Ben Partridge plays it pitch perfectly. His guests improvise so well you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s off the cuff. Mike Bubbins as Eli Roberts is my favourite.\u201d Adam Buxton - Throwing Shade  \u201cMy podcast producer Seamus got me into Throwing Shade, an American podcast hosted by Erin Gibson and Bryan Safi (who describe themselves in their intro as \u201cfeminasty\u201d and \u201chomosensual\u201d respectively). To paraphrase Erin and Bryan, they discuss topics that affect women and gays and treat them with much less respect than they deserve, which means they veer from baffling LA gossip to serious political subjects with an enjoyable mixture of silliness and outrage. When they get the giggles it reminds me of doing the 6 Music music radio show with Joe. They have that thing that is often such a big part of making a good podcast: a shared comedic language of cajoling and teasing that the listener is invited to feel part of.\u201d Scroobius Pip \u2013 The Joe Rogan Experience  \u201cThis is the podcast that got me into podcasts. Two to three hour conversations that can go from discussing the vastness of reality looking both outside of the known universe and inside on a cellular level to making dart jokes at the flick of a switch.\u201d Helen Zaltzman \u2013 The Dinner Party Download \u201cIt\u2019s what I listen to when I can\u2019t figure out what mood I\u2019m in, because it has everything: interviews, music, food, drinks, jokes.\u201d Not forgetting... the Guardian\u2019s range of podcasts     Guardian HQ, Kings Place    Football Weekly - AC Jimbo and the gang break down the beautiful game.
