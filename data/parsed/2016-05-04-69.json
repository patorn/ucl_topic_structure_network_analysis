In an email to staff, Taylor said: \u201cAfter six years of leading in-house entertainment and events, I am writing to tell you that I am moving on from the BBC. During this time I have worked with some incredibly talented on-screen and off-screen presenting and production talent, making every day both challenging and rewarding in unique ways.\u201d It is understood that she has not announced where she is going next or how her departure will affect the new Top Gear. She said in her email: \u201cAs I cha cha cha my way off to my new adventure, I wish you all the success that you surely deserve as part of BBC Studios. I know you will shine.\u201d The BBC director of studios, Mark Linsey, said: \u201cI\u2019ve worked closely with Katie over many years and I\u2019d like to thank her for leading entertainment and events production and managing some of the best entertainment shows on screen.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday the controller of factual and daytime, Natalie Humpheys, announced she was leaving. Mark Freeland, controller of fiction and entertainment, announced his departure last week, following two earlier departures from BBC Studios.",
