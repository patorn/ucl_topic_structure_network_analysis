  "body": "She might be a beloved and bestselling author of classic children\u2019s books from Forever to Blubber, but Judy Blume says she wakes up every day \u201cand I look to the sky, and I say, \u2018whoever\u2019s up there, I thank you for not having to write today\u2019.\u201d Blume doesn\u2019t have to write because, at 78, she has embarked on a new career: she\u2019s an independent bookseller. Together with her husband, George Cooper, she has opened a small, nonprofit bookshop in Key West, Florida, where she\u2019s working almost every day. And she\u2019s loving it. She had planned \u201cto take a gap year\u201d after she finished writing and promoting her last novel, In the Unlikely Event. \u201cI was going to relax and read and have this whole time with no pressure. And then bingo \u2013 the chance comes along to open a bookshop, and there you go. I guess I like that in my life \u2026 To learn something new like this, at 78, makes it all the more exciting.\u201d Blume and Cooper had been urging Mitchell Kaplan, founder of independent book chain Books & Books, to open a bookshop in Key West for years. He told them that if they could find a space, he would partner with them. They found a corner store, part of a large deco building , and with help from Kaplan and his team, Books & Books @ the Studios of Key West opened in February.     \u2018A very satisfying experience\u2019 ...

Photograph: Penguin Random House    \u201cWe\u2019ve done better than anyone, including Mitch, thought we could do,\u201d says Blume, down the line from Florida. \u201cIt has been a very satisfying experience \u2026 Writing In the Unlikely Event took five years \u2013 it was very long and difficult and complicated. This is just a great change for me, and I am enjoying it so much.\u201d Customers, she says, \u201csometimes\u201d recognise her \u2013 an author who has sold more than 80m books around the world \u2013 \u201cand they\u2019re completely taken aback, especially if I\u2019m sitting there dusting the shelves. I\u2019m pretty good at recommendations \u2013 I\u2019m good in the kids\u2019 department for sure. I read all the picture books when they come in. And I can lead people to what they want, although I\u2019ve not read as many of our books as some of our volunteers [the store has two paid employees, as well as Cooper, Blume and a series of volunteers]. I\u2019m trying really hard to keep up. It\u2019s like Christmas every day, working here.\u201d  Business for independent bookstores in America in general, is \u201cgoing well\u201d, Blume believes. \u201cI just think people are so hungry for a real bookstore again. So many people live in places where there isn\u2019t one \u2026 It\u2019s not just us doing well. A lot of independent booksellers are.\u201d The figures back her up. At BookExpo America last week, the American Booksellers Association announced that for the seventh year in a row, its bookstore membership has gone up, to 1,775 members operating in 2,311 locations, up from 1,401 members operating in 1,651 locations in 2009. The lion\u2019s share of these are independents, says the ABA: in 2015, sales for independent booksellers were up just over 10%, and are remaining strong in 2016. In the UK by contrast, the Booksellers Association recorded 894 independent bookshops in 2015, a decrease of 3% from 2014. A decade ago, there were more than 1,500. \u201cIndependent bookselling in the US is continuing not just to grow, but to thrive,\u201d says ABA chief executive Oren Teicher, who attributes the growth to various factors: the localism movement, \u201cwhich is exploding, and we are benefiting from that\u201d; booksellers \u201cgetting smarter at using technology\u201d; publishers\u2019 increasing acknowledgment that \u201ccustomers discover books in bricks and mortar locations [so] our colleagues in publishing have figured out that they need bricks and mortar stores as much as we need their books\u201d; and the growing role of the bookseller as curator, in a world flooded with new titles.

A recent report in the UK revealed that in 2015, sales of printed books were up by 0.4% to \u00a32.76bn, while ebook sales fell for the first time in the seven years the Publishers Association has tracked them, down 1.6% to \u00a3554m in 2015. In the US, the Association of American Publishers reported last month that while overall sales for consumer books were up 0.8% to $7.2bn (\u00a34.9bn) in 2015, ebook sales declined, down 9.5% in adult books and 43.3% in children and young adult titles. \u201cFive years ago in the American book business, there was a widespread panic that somehow digital reading was going to replace physical books and they would be a relic of some other time and place. Fast forward to today, and I think digital reading has levelled off and calmed down slightly. It\u2019s going to be a piece of our business, but print books aren\u2019t going away. We\u2019re living in a hybrid world,\u201d says Teicher. Added together, these ingredients make \u201cthe recipe for our success\u201d, says Teicher. \u201cBut there is still a very modest margin in books, and people have to work really hard. We have significant challenges before us, clouds on the horizon that could interfere with our success.\u201d These range from pressure on wages and rents, he says, to the \u201c1,000lb gorilla\u201d \u2013 the continued growth of online shopping. \u201cBut independents are extraordinarily resilient,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had a penny for every time we\u2019ve been counted out, I\u2019d be a pretty rich guy today.\u201d",
