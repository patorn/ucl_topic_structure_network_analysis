It means being rock\u2019n\u2019roll up to, but not beyond, the two-martinis-on-a-schoolnight watermark. You put on your leopard-print pencil skirt and you\u2019re, like, mentally high-fiving Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg as you leave for the office.     Gigi Hadid for Guess Jeans    But what does gingham mean? This is a matter of some urgency, because gingham is owning spring 2016. Gigi Hadid wears a red-and-white gingham high waisted bikini in American Vogue this month, and wore a black-and-white gingham one-piece swimsuit on her birthday. Poppy Delevingne has designed a black-and-white gingham sundress for cult label Solid and Striped. Prince George\u2019s pyjamas \u2013 which, lets face it, have been this season\u2019s top-scoring outfit so far \u2013 were blue gingham, while his mum wore a gingham dress by bespoke London label Eponine last month. Days later, President Obama wore a gingham shirt for the White House Easter egg roll. Caitlyn Jenner has been wearing a gingham shirt with denim cut-offs; on the J Crew site this month, creative director Jenna Lyons has posted a \u201cgingham diary\u201d with five different looks. (Our favourite: shopping for peonies at a photogenic West Village apothecary while rocking a belted pink gingham blazer #goals.)

It is family-album seaside holiday snaps, school uniforms, homestyle bistro tablecloths. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy\u2019s gingham dress embodies the message of the film: there\u2019s no place like home. I blame this year\u2019s gingham revival at least in part on Taylor Swift, and the Taylor Swiftification of pop culture. Gingham is perfect for Swift\u2019s homebody, cat-loving vibe, and she has worn it for years. If you were invited for brunch with Tay Tay\u2019s squad, you would totally wear gingham. (Squad members Gigi and Kendall Jenner have been at the forefront of this year\u2019s gingham thing.) Gingham is also hot. Bardot in that pink-and-white wedding dress, Monroe in gingham capri pants, Gigi in her swimsuit. It\u2019s an earthy hotness, a girl-can\u2019t-help-it sex appeal rather than the strategic, Versace-wearing kind. (Caveat: this only works on women. On men, gingham isn\u2019t sexy at all, just wholesome. Why is this? Wholesomeness and innocence is appealing in women but not in men?)     Marilyn Monroe in gingham capri pants. Photograph: Alfred Eisenstaedt/The Life Picture Collection/Getty Images       Warehouse off-the-shoulder gingham dress    And it is particularly hot right now. \u201cGingham is moving away from the Stepford wives connotations,\u201d says Harvey Nichols fashion buying director Anita Barr. \u201cIt works particularly well for summer, playing on the French Riviera traditions of the 1950s. A grown-up, contemporary variation was seen at Stella McCartney, who plays with an asymmetric print in bold primary colours. Or if you\u2019re looking for a subtle nod to the trend, Alexander McQueen\u2019s woven leather stiletto heels, toe-capped using a gingham print, add an edgier ladylike look.\u201d \u201cGingham says attitude: sweet, sassy, a bit geeky,\u201d say the Warehouse design team, who have come up with an early summer hit with their monochrome gingham off-the-shoulder dress, (\u00a349). What does it all mean? Well, for a start, it means you should buy the dress.",
