  "body": "The new head of the Australian Medical Association has said fighting the Coalition\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d six-year Medicare freeze is his highest priority in his new post. West Australian obstetrician Dr Michael Gannon, appointed to a two-year term as AMA president at the organisation\u2019s national conference on Sunday, said general practitioners could not endure more restrictions imposed upon their working conditions. \u201cGPs are at breaking point. They can\u2019t take too many more cuts,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cThe freeze is unfair and it\u2019s wrong. It reflects a continued underinvestment in general practice, the best value-for-money part of our health system in so many ways.   Related: Medicare co-payments are fine \u2013 for those with the capacity to pay | Toby Hall    \u201cHigh-quality primary care reduces the need for more expensive hospital admissions. For too long we\u2019ve under invested in general practice; unravelling the freeze is so important.\u201d The AMA\u2019s stance is supported by a television advertising campaign launched on Sunday by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners condemning the six-year freeze on Medicare rebates.  In May\u2019s budget, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced the controversial freeze on indexation for Medicare rebates would continue until the 2019-20 financial year. As part of its election health policy, Labor has promised to remove the freeze, a move it says will cost $2.4bn over four years. The government says Labor\u2019s estimate is too low, and the promise is inadequately funded.  Gannon replaces as AMA President Professor Brian Owler, a neurosurgeon whose two-year term had expired, and who urged his replacement on Sunday to be \u201cbrave and courageous\u201d. Owler was an outspoken critic of the current Coalition government, particularly in the wake of the 2014 budget which proposed introducing a $7 GP co-payment. The AMA fought vigorously against the levy\u2019s introduction, forcing then prime minister Tony Abbott to declare it \u201cdead, buried, and cremated\u201d in December 2014. Gannon is expected to take a more conciliatory approach towards dealing with the government. He has previously said the AMA was becoming too left wing. Gannon, head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the St John of God Subiaco hospital in Perth, told News Corporation earlier this year the AMA should work more closely with government, and that refugee health, in particular, was not core business for the organisation.   Related: Turnbull is introducing GP co-payment by stealth, doctors say    \u201cThe criticism that is made of the current leadership is that it\u2019s strong on progressive policies but not listened to by the conservative government.\u201d \u201cMy view is the Turnbull government will be re-elected and we need to build bridges,\u201d he said. But Gannon said on Sunday the AMA, under his stewardship, was prepared to engage constructively with the government, \u201cwhichever political party is in power\u201d. \u201cThere are currently reviews into the Medicare Benefits Schedule, private health insurance, and primary health care. \u201cIt is vital that the profession has a strong voice in Canberra, and is willing to embark on constructive interaction with government in responding to the recommendations that these reports will inevitably include. \u201cIf the government does not talk to the AMA, and vice versa, we are both poorer, and it is our patients who suffer most.\u201d",
