Related: Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 charged with violent conduct  for \u2018eye-gouging\u2019 Diego Costa    Tottenham will need a temporary home in 2017-18 while the final phase of building work on their new 61,000-capacity ground on the existing White Hart Lane site is completed and they have been in talks for months with the FA over using the national stadium. Tottenham have long known that they might be able to relocate for the season to stadium:mk in Milton Keynes but they have more recently pursued what would be an upgrade to Wembley. Dyke said: \u201cWe\u2019re in discussions with Tottenham that they should come in for a full season when they\u2019re building their new stadium, and we are a long way down the path on reaching agreement. \u201cI think there are some discussions about whether they will play Champions League games at Wembley next year but I don\u2019t know much about that. But on the full season [2017-18] \u2013 think we\u2019re quite close to a deal.\u201d Tottenham will play their final season at the 36,000-capacity White Hart Lane next time out and they intend to be in their new \u00a3400m home for 2018-19. The FA could raise around \u00a315m from staging a Premier League club\u2019s home fixtures. \u201cWe thought we had a responsibility to English football if we can fit [the clubs] in, and that money we can use to support grassroots football,\u201d Dyke said. \u201cIn particular, we want to use it to build all-weather pitches, which is something I\u2019ve been going about for two or three years.\u201d Chelsea have also expressed an interest in using Wembley while they redevelop Stamford Bridge \u2013 there would be no overlap with Tottenham in 2017-18, as things stand. \u201cChelsea have really exciting plans for that stadium \u2013 to demolish the whole thing and build a new one on the existing site,\u201d Dyke said. \u201cIf they came [to Wembley], that would mean coming for three years.\u201d",
