  "body": "Alastair Cook mused on the contrasting emotions thrown up by sport after seeing Jimmy Anderson rout Sri Lanka here two years after the same opposition, on the same ground, reduced him to tears.   Related: Jimmy Anderson leads charge again as England rout Sri Lanka inside three days    Anderson was last man out off what would have been the penultimate ball of the 2014 Test for what was a series-sealing defeat, but his match figures of 10 for 45 this year set up an innings victory and leave his captain in a philosophical mood: \u201cTurning up here this week, there\u2019s no doubt you wondered if the cricketing gods have something in store for you again,\u201d said Cook. \u201cYou never bury a moment like 2014 but we put in a performance here at the standards at which we can play. And that\u2019s sport, some days are good, some are bad. It\u2019s amazing. The same opposition and same place and such contrasting emotions.\u201d In a Test dominated by bowlers, it would be England\u2019s wicketkeeper, Jonny Bairstow, who claimed man of the match after his 140 as well as nine catches across the two Sri Lankan implosions. Cook said: \u201cJonny was playing on a different wicket to the other 21 guys, it was an extraordinary innings. I remember the first time I saw him play for Yorkshire at Scarborough [in 2010] and thought he\u2019d play for England. There hasn\u2019t been a better batsman in the country over the past two years.\u201d Sri Lanka, following on, were 77 for two when rain brought an early lunch on the third day, only to fold to 119 all out by 5.15pm after England received a pep talk from their head coach, Trevor Bayliss, a man of few words.

But no, he said to make sure we are on it from ball one. Sometimes after a break you can drift into a session. We were OK in the morning session but it reminded us to be switched on.\u201d The Sri Lanka captain, Angelo Mathews, said: \u201cIt was a quite an embarrassing defeat. Everything went wrong for us apart from winning the toss. Anderson and Stuart Broad bowled beautifully and we couldn\u2019t handle it. It was swinging and seaming. \u201cWe have a few days to regroup, all we have got to do is change our mindset and believe we can do it. It was a humiliating defeat but if we stick to our plans we can turn it around.\u201d",
