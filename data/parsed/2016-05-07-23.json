  "body": "It was the most glorious day of the year so far. So where better to go than an indoor event devoted to a celebration of tedium? Well, that was the view of 400 people who packed into London\u2019s Conway Hall for the sixth annual Boring Conference to ponder the \u201cmundane, ordinary, obvious and overlooked\u201d. Seventeen speakers gave short talks on a quotidian subject of their choice. Speaking outside beforehand, the genial organiser, James Ward, assured the Observer of the quality of what was to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good line-up this year, with the exception of me,\u201d said Ward. \u201cI\u2019m there as ballast.\u201d As in previous years, Ward gave the first talk himself. \u201cBoring continues to sell out, despite Ward\u2019s growing animosity towards the project,\u201d he said, by way of introduction. Everyone laughed \u2013 many of the crowd were Boring Conference regulars. You might expect such a wilfully contrary event to attract a lot of ocean-going hipsters, but I only counted one waxed moustache. Ward listed six facts about the number six. \u201cSix comes between five and seven,\u201d he said. \u201cThree times two equals six, and it works the other way as well \u2013 what are the chances? There are six members of S Club 7 I don\u2019t want to marry. The Birmingham Six spent 16 years in prison, which is six plus six plus half of six plus a sixth of six. An insect has six legs. Six is the atomic number of carbon.\u201d These genuinely dull facts were poor preparation for the rest of the talks. In a boringly predictable way, despite the subject titles, the Boring Conference was nothing of the sort. Each speaker was knowledgeable, funny and fully engaged. Just as any subject can wilt in the wrong hands, a good speaker can breathe fire into the most unpromising topic. Ward was listened to with rapt attention as he expounded on \u201cPedestrian Crossing Signals used in the GDR, 1961-1998\u201d, a history of the distinctive socialist green and red figures who appeared on traffic signals in East Germany until the fall of the Berlin wall. \u201cThat was my favourite so far,\u201d said Kate Danvers, from New Zealand, during a break. \u201cI\u2019m looking around at everything in the street differently now. It\u2019s amazing what people get interested in.\u201d She had flown over from Amsterdam for the event, drawn by the \u201canti-marketing\u201d of the title.

He explained his love of jigsaws while beginning a 1,000-piecer live on stage. There he stayed for the rest of the day, his progress streamed live online. Like life itself, he explained, a jigsaw was a big problem you could solve by following a series of small steps. \u201cThere are two schools of thought on whether it\u2019s cheating to look at the box,\u201d he added. Even here were interesting nuggets. I didn\u2019t know that \u201c1,000-piece\u201d jigsaws were usually in fact 1,026 pieces, following a 38\u00b527 grid. The rest of the day\u2019s topics covered a mind-boggling sweep of interests: Alexandra Palace, bricks, boring (as in drilling), the word \u201cthe\u201d, a proposed alternative system of coinage, \u201cpaper bags from independent bookshops\u201d. Catherine O\u2019Flynn spoke with her novelist\u2019s eye for detail about mediocre British chain restaurants and the \u201cunguessable exuberance\u201d of their menus\u2019 descriptions of dessert. Tom Jackson read from some of his collection of more than 1,000 old postcards. Design historian Ellie Herring gave a potted history of the issues surrounding streetlight design. When they were first introduced, she explained, there were serious concerns about their unflattering effect on women\u2019s faces and makeup. A personal highlight was writer Nicholas Tufnell\u2019s talk, perhaps because it had the least promising subject. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak about toilets,\u201d he explained. \u201cSpecifically, toilet roll. More specifically, the serial numbers inside toilet roll tubes, which I\u2019ve been collecting my whole life.\u201d By taking the quality control numbers from inside these tubes, he developed a system for creating imaginative verse. He read two very different poems inspired by the toilets of Hackney and Islington. Poetry was about taking the mundane and making it magnificent, he added. By this definition, Boring VI was richly poetic. Long may its founder\u2019s delight in the mundane and obscure continue.",
