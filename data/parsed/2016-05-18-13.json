  "body": "Jeremy Hunt and the British Medical Association, who were at loggerheads until last week, are each hailing the new version of the junior doctors\u2019 contract as a victory for them. So who has done best out of the negotiated settlement? Both have given ground, but both have advanced some of their key aims, as part of the compromise.  Weekend working In future, Saturdays and Sundays will count as \u201cplain time\u201d \u2013 part of a junior doctor\u2019s normal working week. This is a big U-turn by the BMA, which had consistently refused to countenance any of Saturday being classified that way.  However, trainee medics will receive extra money for working at least seven full weekends a year up to a maximum 10% increase in their pay, depending on how often they do so. Most will receive at least the 3% uplift for doing seven weekends.  Hunt was able to hail the BMA\u2019s change of tack as helping him to bring in the \u201ctruly seven-day NHS\u201d that the Conservatives have pledged. The new system makes it a third cheaper for hospitals to roster junior doctors to work at weekends, he says.  Night working The BMA are claiming that a complicated new payments system for overnight working is a big improvement for doctors. Pay is going down from 50% extra for a shift to 37% for working at least eight hours any time between 8pm and 10am. But the union says that it will also end some anomalies that meant some doctors working very late at night did not get a premium rate in return.  Basic pay The 55,000 junior doctors in the NHS in England will now get an increase in their basic pay of 10%-11% and not the 13.5% the health secretary previously promised, because other changes to their payments make it harder to keep the package cost-neutral \u2013 another Hunt pledge.  Also, most juniors will also get a separate 8% uplift to their pay so long as they do on-call work, which almost all do. Pay premia for young doctors opting to specialise in A&E, psychiatry and oral and maxilo-facial medicine have been increased to \u00a320,000. And while doctors doing locum shiftss will have to first offer their services to the NHS, they will get a 22% bonus every time they do.  Role of new guardians of safe working The BMA has strengthened its role in creating these new posts, which will ensure that hospitals do not force junior doctors to work excessive hours. Trainee medics see them as vital to ensuring they do not become overworked and so compromise patient safety. Each NHS trust must now set up a junior doctors\u2019 forum to advise the guardian, while the BMA will also now be represented at any hearing of an appeal against a guardian\u2019s decision.  Equalities issues Efforts have been made to minimise the discrimination against part-time and, especially, female junior doctors, which the government acknowledged in its own equalities impact assessment of the previous contract. Specifically, medics returning after some time out \u2013 after having a child, for example \u2013 will receive \u201ctargeted accelerated learning\u201d, including a mentor, to help them get back up to speed fast with learning they have missed.  But the new deal does not offer anything concrete to help junior doctors overcome the difficulty of arranging childcare for the extra weekend shifts many will be working \u2013 another problem identified by the equality assessment back in March.  Imposition v introduction Until two weeks ago Hunt was adamant that he would impose an unpopular contract that 98% of junior doctors had voted to go on strike over. Now a much-changed contract will be introduced by agreement \u2013 if junior doctors endorse the whole package in their ballot \u2013 thus preserving the BMA\u2019s historical status as a key partner in employment and contractual issues in the NHS. If accepted, the BMA will avoid the damaging split that its leadership had begun to fear in recent months.",
