Don\u2019t believe the hype: \u00a36bn is a large sum, but not quite as it seems. About a third probably covers newly arrived EE\u2019s expansion of its 4G mobile network, which is spending that would have happened anyway. The Openreach broadband element \u2013 call it \u00a34bn \u2013 equates to \u00a31.33bn a year since this is a three-year programme. That\u2019s an upgrade from a current rate of \u00a31bn a year, but we\u2019re not talking tsunamis.   Related: BT to spend \u00a36bn on superfast broadband and 4G rollout    Nor does the spending represent a technological revolution. BT aims to deploy \u201cultrafast\u201d broadband to 12m premises but the tally includes only 2m sites with fibre-optic, or fibre to the premises (FTTP), lines, which purists regard as the only kit worthy of the \u201cultra\u201d superlative. For its part BT counters that its G fast system, which uses copper wires for the last leg, is sufficiently speedy and more affordable for most punters\u2019 purposes. The argument would be almost academic if Ofcom wasn\u2019t so keen on promoting FTTP for the national digital health. In its last review, the regulator spoke about a \u201cgood outcome in the long term\u201d being 40% of households with FTTP. BT\u2019s plan \u2013 even when added to Virgin Media\u2019s investment in equivalent technology \u2013 won\u2019t get the UK to that level. It\u2019s hard, though, to see how Ofcom would vent any frustration with BT. Forced separation is off the agenda (at least for the time being) for the strong reason that an independent Openreach might have fewer incentives to invest. Thus plan A is to encourage competition by allowing rivals to use BT\u2019s ducts and poles to build their own fibre networks. From a regulatory perspective, the approach is coherent but it relies on competitors to BT actually risking their capital. BT\u2019s shareholders don\u2019t seem remotely troubled by the prospect. They can see their company doesn\u2019t have to break sweat with its \u00a36bn programme and they lapped up the promise of 10%-plus dividend growth in each of the next two years. The shares were the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100. The market\u2019s reaction is fair. But it\u2019s impossible to shake the sense that life for BT is just too comfortable at present. The \u00a36bn wave is underwhelming. Centrica\u2019s empty boast angers investors The first shock Iain Conn delivered to Centrica\u2019s shareholders didn\u2019t really meet the description. By the time the chief executive arrived from BP at the start of last year, cutting the dividend by 30% was the prudent course. But Thursday\u2019s surprise \u2013 a share placing to raise \u00a3700m \u2013 definitely moved the dial. Nobody saw it coming, thus the violent 10% share price fall. Strictly speaking, Conn has not diverted from the strategy he outlined last summer. After too many years chasing exploration and production assets that turned out to be overpriced, Centrica would be a customer-facing \u201cenergy and services company\u201d. It sounded commendably dull, as the owner of British Gas should be. It\u2019s just that investors had assumed Conn\u2019s intention to display \u201ccapital discipline\u201d meant the new adventure could be funded by internal cashflows. Instead, a couple of small acquisitions \u2013 one of \u00a3200m, one of \u00a3150m - has sent Centrica into a panic about a possible downgrade of its credit rating. The worry is legitimate since borrowings stood at \u00a34.7bn at the last count. But Conn was also banging on about being \u201con track to deliver against our 2016 targets\u201d only three weeks ago. You can\u2019t blame investors for being furious: if capital discipline means tapping shareholders for the odd \u00a3700m so soon after a dividend cut, what\u2019s the boast worth? Donald Trump should stop yelling at Yellen How bad would a Donald Trump presidential victory be for financial markets? Whatever your guess, add a few percentage points after the presumptive Republican nominee said he would probably ditch Janet Yellen as chair of the US Federal Reserve when her first term finishes in 2018. Fed chairs normally have to screw up monumentally not to be granted a second term whoever is president (Ben Bernanke even survived the banking crisis). Yellen\u2019s crime, as Trump sees things, is that she is not a Republican. Maybe you\u2019d expect him to take that line. But investors would also expect presidential candidates to stay quiet and not undermine the Fed chair until the moment of replacement arrives. Rolls-Royce puts a high value on Singer After all the fuss (at least in this column), Rolls-Royce\u2019s shareholders ushered Bradley Singer, the man from activist US hedge fund ValueAct Capital, into the boardroom with a 94% vote in favour. It\u2019s their lookout, but that majority is astonishing. Singer may be a fine fellow but ValueAct has a supporting role in the horror show that is Canadian pharmaceutical firm Valeant, a demonstration of how financial engineering can go seriously wrong when applied to an industry that runs on long-term investment.",
