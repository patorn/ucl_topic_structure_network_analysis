  "body": "Father John Misty has just begun his fourth song when there\u2019s a commotion in the crowd. \u201cDo we have a medical emergency?\u201d he asks, as the music stops and house lights come up. Eventually, normality resumes, and his band simply pick up Only Son of the Ladiesman where they left off \u2013 where the song\u2019s lothario protagonist has died, and his \u201cused body\u201d is being flailed at his funeral by numerous irate conquests. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want a medical emergency in that song,\u201d quips the Father, drily. Everything seems to be turning out right for Josh Hillman. In his 20s, as J Tillman, he released several earnest singer-songwriter albums that were mostly ignored. He drummed in Fleet Foxes, before a psychedelic experience provided the revelation that led to the Father John Misty persona: a tongue-in-cheek, wry, drug-crazed Casanova. We first heard him on 2012\u2019s Fear Fun, but last year\u2019s superior follow-up, I Love You, Honeybear, turned him into an international star. This time \u2013 inspired by hismarriage to film-maker Emma Garr - the songs used the new persona to explore love and, ironically, leave him more emotionally exposed than he was before. When he drops to one knee to sing, \u201cI can hardly believe I\u2019ve found you and I\u2019m terrified by that\u201d, it\u2019s part theatre, part raw honesty of a kind songwriters generally shy away from.     Letting the songs do the talking \u2026 Father John Misty. Photograph: Andrew Benge/Redferns    The character has also turned him from background wallflower to pelvis-thrusting, guitar-hurling, biblically bearded charisma volcano \u2013 Jim Morrison\u2019s head on Jarvis Cocker\u2019s knowingly gyrating body. Half-hilarious, half-sensual, he doesn\u2019t so much own the stage as lease the land for several miles around. Despite a reputation as a devilish raconteur, he says little here, but this means the songs speak for themselves. He\u2019s like peak-period Elton John with Nick Drake\u2019s strings as killer titles (Nothing Good Ever Happens at the Goddamn Thirsty Crow or When You\u2019re Smiling and Astride Me) deliver high-rolling, comical tales of unprotected sex alongside searing insights and confessionals. Like an edgy standup who has an audience not knowing if they\u2019re supposed to laugh, the emotional wallops come when they\u2019re least expected.   Related: Father John Misty: \u2018I wanted to write about love without bullshitting\u2019    He\u2019s dropped the canned laughter in Bored In the USA\u2019s list of modern American ills, which means the song shapeshifts from wryly satirical to powerful and devastating. One minute he\u2019s screaming like early Nick Cave or introducing \u201cmy favourite love song\u201d \u2013 Nine Inch Nails\u2019 electro stomper Closer (chorus: \u201cI want to fuck you like an animal\u201d). The next he\u2019s delivering I Love You, Honeybear as such a beautiful statement of adoration it\u2019s a wonder no one cries.  There are more rollicking ribald confessionals of personal failings in The Ideal Husband (as our hero, ahem, mounts the drum kit to tell his new wife about \u201cevery woman that I\u2019ve slept with \u2026\u201d), but in playing this show more straight, the person behind the persona emerges as the great American singer-songwriter he probably always wanted to be in the first place.  At Glasgow Academy tonight, Manchester Albert Hall Friday 13 May, then touring.",
