  "body": "Benjamin Jullien has had a somewhat nomadic start to his career, the 21-year-old already playing in four different countries on his way to becoming a surprise package in Warrington\u2019s impressive start to the season. \u201cI started playing in the under-20s at Avignon and it was a great experience for the one year I was there playing,\u201d the Frenchman says. \u201cThen I went to Brisbane for six months to try it out, playing for their feeder team at 18 to see how I got on.\u201d A spell at lower league North Wales Crusaders followed before a trial with the Wolves last year resulted in the club handing the second-row or centre a full-time deal. Jullien has since made eight appearances this season and could feature again on Sunday as the league leaders travel to Wakefield.

I expected to play about two games this year. This is my first year in Super League and I\u2019m really grateful to the club for the chance they\u2019ve given me.\u201d Opting to leave home as a teenager to try to secure a future as a professional, Jullien has ended up living a humble lifestyle on site at the club\u2019s training campus at the University of Chester, which does have its benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard living at the university because all the students help me and give me English lessons,\u201d he says. Most French players have traditionally played for Catalans Dragons, but Jullien believes that more young Frenchmen will opt to look to come across the Channel. \u201cI preferred coming to England as opposed to going to Perpignan,\u201d he says. \u201cCatalans have a lot of Australian players and the French lads don\u2019t have much chance of playing, unfortunately.\u201d",
