  "body": "PUBS Fox and Hounds, Ennerdale, Lake District A fine stop on the coast-to-coast walk (Ennerdale is the first stop on Wainwright\u2019s famous trail), this pub is also a decent pitstop for a pint after a less-ambitious stroll up Grike Fell. After the Fox and Hounds closed in 2010, the community came together to buy the pub lease, and it nails that winning formula: good beer (all sourced from West Cumbria brewers including the local Ennerdale Brewery), locally sourced food and a friendly atmosphere.\u2022 01946 861 373, foxandhoundsinn.org Red Lion, Preston, Hertfordshire       Related: 10 of the best community-run cottages, hostels and guesthouses in the UK    In the 1980s, the phrase \u201ccommunity-run pub\u201d had all the allure of a parish council meeting. The Red Lion started a huge change in perception back then, as the first example of a community-owned public house anywhere in the UK, having been bought from Whitbread, and is still going strong with a recipe of hand-pulled pints, good food and convivial events.\u2022 01462 459585, theredlionpreston.co.uk Golden Ball, York      Recently transformed by community ownership into a great social hub inside York\u2019s city walls, the Golden Ball story is an inspiration. At the heart of the Grade II-listed pub \u2013 with a well-preserved Victorian layout and lovely tiled bar \u2013 is the hand-pulled beer: a broad range of old local favourites (Timothy Taylor\u2019s Golden Best, Everards Tiger) and new contenders like local micro-brewery Treboom\u2019s Yorkshire Sparkle.\u2022 01904 652211, goldenballyork.co.uk RESTAURANTS The Clink, Cardiff Prison      The idea is simple: teach prisoners to cook and serve good food, and afterwards, employment, rather than reoffending, beckons. It works. Plus the food is excellent and seasonal \u2013 confit of sea trout, samphire and sorrel followed by elderflower and strawberry panna cotta, for example. The Clink at Cardiff (there are others at Brixton, High Down and Styal) won the Sustainable Restaurant Association\u2019s three-star award and consistently gathers recommendations.\u2022 Three courses from \u00a325, 029 2092 31310, theclinkcharity.org Brigade Bar and Bistro, London      Housed in a magnificent Victorian fire station near the south side of Tower Bridge, the Brigade is a social enterprise that gives homeless people a chance to learn culinary skills, then apply them. Reviews are impressive \u2013 for innovative bistro-style dishes such as barbecued sticky partridge, ox burger and pineapple carpaccio.\u2022 Three courses from \u00a335, 0844 346 1225, thebrigade.co.uk Star Bistro, Cheltenham      Right on the 102-mile Cotswold Way, the Star Bistro is one stop you wouldn\u2019t want to miss. It\u2019s in the grounds of Ullenwood Manor, home to National Star College for disabled people. The students gain work experience, you get superlative food \u2013 from breakfast to afternoon tea.\u2022 01242 535984, nationalstar.org MUSEUMS Maritime Heritage Centre, Scarborough      Is there a town in the UK with more maritime heritage than Scarborough? Staffed and run entirely by local volunteers, the SMHC has pulled together all kinds of fascinating material, including a set of original Victorian lantern slides and model ships. There are also special exhibitions and archives.\u2022 Donations, open Wed-Sun 11am-4pm, 01723 369361, scarboroughsmaritimeheritage.org.uk  The Whitaker, Rawtenstall, Lancashire      The classic tale of a much-loved local resource saved by the locals themselves applies to this fine, vibrant museum in a beautiful park at the centre of the Rossendale Valley. At the heart of it is a Victorian natural history collection, but temporary exhibitions and an excellent cafe-bar all add to the experience.\u2022 Open Wed-Sun 10-4pm, 01706 260785, thewhitaker.org Coastal Communities Museum, North Berwick, East Lothian      This energetic and fascinating place is dedicated to the people of this area, and run by them. Its centrepiece is the optics from engineer David Stevenson\u2019s 1902 Bass Rock lighthouse, which visitors can operate. A pre-second world war beach hut offers kids some dressing up opportunities. There\u2019s a cafe too.\u2022 Open Wed-Sun 11-4pm, 01620 894313, coastalmuseum.org Ashburton Museum, Devon     Moccassins and other Native American artefacts at the Ashburton Museum    This tiny gem is full of Dartmoor objects but also has, surprisingly, a fine collection of Native American artefacts. And it\u2019s all run by volunteers.\u2022 Adults \u00a31.50, children free, open Tues-Fri 2-4pm and Sat 10am-12pm, 01364 653595, ashburton.org/museum.htm",
