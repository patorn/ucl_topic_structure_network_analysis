Someone I now forgetonce saidjourneying is hard.The moon glimmersin the brown channel. Yangtze is the concluding poem in Sarah Howe\u2019s Loop of Jade, her TS Eliot prize-winning first collection published last May by Chatto. Tracing memory over recent experience, and vice versa, Howe gathers into Loop of Jade an extended and variegated commentary on her return visits to mainland China and Hong Kong, where she lived until she was just shy of eight years old. A Renaissance scholar at Harvard University, Howe often writes a dense, coruscating kind of poem, where language is the foregrounded loop, and adds its own richness to the richness of memoir and \u201cdeep\u201d travelogue. On other occasions, as in Yangtze, she seems to stand back and trust a cooler, simpler, descriptive mode. Is this a voice from the Chinese \u201cside\u201d of her literary inheritance? Perhaps, but it also recalls an American poet still setting an example for later generations, Elizabeth Bishop. Yangtze\u2019s structure sometimes recalls that of haiku. Haiku is not, of course, a Chinese form, but there were Chinese nutrients in the soil of its flowering. Yangtze is evocatively haiku-like in some of its procedures: the somewhat ad hoc approach to punctuation (which often disappears altogether, enhancing the symbiotic flow of imagery), the juxtapositions, the silences, the sense of the unsaid. Grammatical connection may slip quietly away: in stanza two, for instance, \u201cBy remote paths, / twisting pines,\u201d and in the pure \u201chaiku moment\u201d of stanza five: \u201cFrom the white /eyelet of a star/ the sound of ripples.\u201d The movement between associative or impressionistic writing and the denotative is one of the poem\u2019s many pleasures. It imitates the mind in travelling mode \u2013 the way we might explain to ourselves (or check in the guidebook) the backstory of some new sight, or simply let impressions float over us. The poem goes with the flow of the river while accommodating the physicality of the journey: \u201cour crude boat / chugging / points towards Chonqing\u201d. I admire its effortlessly aleatory quality, its natural pattern-making and avoidance of symmetry. Each stanza is the length it needs to be, the length of a span of attention that naturally varies as it reflects what is seen, thought, felt. The diction is precision-tooled, yet appears transparent as clean water. The rhythm is slow, but never too slow. An asterisk after stanza five marks a pause, but it\u2019s the merest breathing space. When movement resumes, there\u2019s some luminous narrative detail about the fisherman in his \u201chigh-prowed skiff\u201d, and some some nice alliterative music, before a dreamlike descent into the underworld of \u201cthe sunken valley\u201d. Howe\u2019s short, sometimes one-beat units in the penultimate stanza (\u201ctowns that once / held hundreds / of thousands\u201d) seem to prepare for the ensuing self-interruption. The speaker is about to tell us what the shells of the abandoned houses \u201cfill with\u201d \u2013 when she finds she can\u2019t. It\u2019s a moment reminiscent of the concluding stanza of Bishop\u2019s One Art, where the speaker has to force herself, publicly, to write down the dreaded phrase admitting that losing her lover feels \u201clike disaster\u201d. Howe\u2019s missing word(s) may be too painful, or too elusive. Her question, urgent with repetition (\u201cwhat, what is it they fill with?\u201d) also corrects the tendency of poems, even with the most honourable intentions, to hasten towards emotive answers. The Yangtze has suffered cataclysms of development, noted here by a journalist describing her cruise from Chongqing to the Three Gorges Dam. It\u2019s been suggested that the erection of this vast hydroelectric plant is among the most significant alterations ever made to the natural world.   Related: Poetry, music and identity with Sarah Howe, Emmy the Great and Solomon OB \u2013 books podcast    Unmistakeably elegiac, Howe\u2019s poem notices effects rather than their cause. In addition to her eloquent local phenomena stands the symbolism of the unfinished bridge, indicating the bisection of tradition and progress, old and new technologies. The poem\u2019s embedded refrain, \u201cjourneying is hard\u201d, possibly from Li Po, (although many traveling poets have said the same) may be Howe\u2019s reference to China\u2019s costly march into modernity. That process is haunted \u2013 and so is the process of the poem. The river is haunted by the \u201cghost forest\u201d in in its depths. The water-haunted trees haunt their drought-stricken roots. The fisherman whose net catches \u201cthe wizened finger / of a submerged branch\u201d may sense the possibility of a failing livelihood. And, of course, the poem\u2019s last stanza is haunted, wonderfully, by what has been said and shown earlier, the \u2013 pretended? \u2013 failure to remember who said \u201cjourneying is hard\u201d and the image of the glimmering moon and \u201cthe brown channel\u201d. It\u2019s as if the river\u2019s course had been deflected from linearity to form yet another \u201cloop of jade\u201d in Howe\u2019s lustrously layered treasury of poetic time.",
