  "body": "In Cannes, it is de rigueur to stand in line for a couple of hours, with about 2,000 others, sun beating, water confiscated, for the chance to watch a three-hour Romanian film set in a funeral during the cold war whose references you won\u2019t get, whose quality is still undetermined and which might never get released. But for those times when the highbrow can feel a little daunting, a trip to \u201cthe market\u201d always puts things in perspective. In the basement of the Palais, the convention centre that hosts the festival, like a very gaudy, very guilty secret, are hundreds of stalls at which people from all around the world hawk the movies that people actually go and see: dodgy horrors and wobbly softcore, deeply cheap cartoons and an astonishing number of films featuring ponies. Taking a tour is a refreshing reminder of where cinema is really at. But it\u2019s also a tragic experience. You hear the desperate flogging of scores of dead horses; you see some of the same films up for sale year after year, like puppies the pound just can\u2019t put down. Here\u2019s some of the fresh meat at this year\u2019s market. Attack of the Killer Donuts      Ever said you\u2019d die for a Krispy Kreme? Here\u2019s the movie to prove that arterial clogging isn\u2019t the only risk of these sweet treats. In fact, it may be an artfully disguised public health broadcast.  Operation Neighborhood Watch      At the age of 45, Denise Richards is no longer Hollywood\u2019s sexy ingenue, but middle America\u2019s disapproving mom who, from the looks of it, gets to spend an entire film fully-clothed, sighing and rolling her eyes at children. That\u2019s your future, Blake Lively!  Dudes & Dragons      Despite the over-enthused cult that surrounds and frantically masturbates along to Game of Thrones, there are apparently a few major problems that can be easily fixed in just one film. More dragons! More dudes! More booty! Less budget! Sam      Tom Hooper\u2019s Oscar-bait trans biopic The Danish Girl was so politely told that we half-expected the director himself to offer us a cup of tea at the end. Which is why we would take this obnoxious-looking comedy, with seriously skewed logic, as a palate-cleanser until Hollywood finally works out how to deal with LGBT issues with the requisite intellect. Painkillers     painkillers    One has to admire the insanely arrogant assumptions made by this poster. It\u2019s the new CARRY SLEE! You know, from the people who made REGRET! With all those names at the bottom that could just be a list of on-set cleaners! Breaking Legs      Legs will break! We can\u2019t quite tell if this is an inspirational dance flick or a gruesome body horror. Either way, we admire the use of the Cannes logo in the corner, usually reserved for films selected as part of the festival, not being sold in some creepy booth in the basement.  A Fish Story      Wacky monkeys, dogs and sharks are standard ingredients at the march\u00e9 but where them fish at? They\u2019re here! Although, sadly, we\u2019re missing a shot of a young girl giving the \u201cWhat are you even like!!!\u201d look to a big old bass. Gibby      Did you imagine even the most minor movie monkeys don\u2019t have first-name brand recognition these days? Well, think again. For you really don\u2019t want to piss off the star of Gibby, not with her reputation \u2013 and her entourage. La Trampa       The tagline reads like a drunk horoscope; the picture suggests dogging in a picture-framers involving a sailor, a clown and a postman. \u201cIt could happen to you!\u201d Lucky, lucky us.  Shark Exorcist      Movies are known for inventing niche jobs that would never actually exist (Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s \u201cwoman who lures men out of living with their parents\u201d in Failure to Launch is a low point) but we would like to live in a world where a shark exorcist is a thing. Maybe he or she could send all dumbass B-movies involving sharks straight to hell.",
