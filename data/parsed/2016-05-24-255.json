These are United\u2019s emerging starlets, all hoping to form the next generation of home-reared first-team players who can shape United\u2019s future. All were given debuts by Van Gaal and all may ponder what their fate will be under the Dutchman\u2019s successor. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is the super coach whose track record is hardly super regarding honing fresh talent. Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku can each tell tales of Mourinho\u2019s lack of faith in their ability. He inherited De Bruyne when he took over Chelsea for a second time in June 2013. The Belgian was 21 and lasted half a season before being sold to Wolfsburg for \u00a318m. After being voted German footballer of the year for 2014-15, Manchester City paid \u00a355m for him and he was arguably the side\u2019s best player last season. While at Chelsea there is a story of Mourinho taking De Bruyne aside to explain tactics and what was required of him. The forward, despite his callow years, is said to have taken no notice, deciding the Special One\u2019s ideas were not worth buying into.           Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?    Lukaku joined Chelsea in 2011 and was 19 at the beginning of Mourinho\u2019s second spell there. The striker was sent on loan to Everton in the manager\u2019s first campaign and sold to the same club for \u00a328m in July 2014. Last term proved the big breakthrough as he scored 25 times in 48 appearances for Everton. Lukaku may leave Goodison Park this summer. One likely destination is Chelsea, but to reacquire him the London club would have to pay about twice what he cost Everton. De Bruyne and Lukaku were youngsters bought by the club. Mourinho\u2019s record with home-grown talent was worse. In his two periods at Stamford Bridge, 2004-07 and 2013-15, not one player produced by Chelsea became a first-team first choice. And there is no single player who illustrates this point better than Josh McEachran. Touted as a major talent at every stage coming through the youth ranks, he spent all of Mourinho\u2019s second spell on loan, at Watford, Wigan Athletic and Vitesse Arnhem. Now 23, the midfielder is playing for Brentford. Even the one exception allowed more than a few minutes of first-team action, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, is no shaft of light for Rashford and company. The midfielder was 18 when Mourinho handed him a debut in December 2014, as a substitute in a Champions League group game against Sporting Lisbon. Only three more appearances followed that season, and by the following October Mourinho was criticising him. \u201cHe is brilliant with the ball,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look 19 \u2013 he looks solid, stable and mature. But without the ball he doesn\u2019t look as good tactically. I wanted more stability defensively. I see him playing there [in the holding role] when he has the defensive ability to do that.\u201d This analysis came after Mourinho took off Loftus-Cheek at half-time during the 2-0 win over Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge, which the manager appeared to promise was the start of a run of games. \u201cHe\u2019s a player to start the next game and a run of matches, to try and get that stability as a first-team choice,\u201d Mourinho had said of a player who joined Chelsea aged eight. But he granted Loftus-Cheek only a single further minute, in November\u2019s 0-0 draw at Tottenham Hotspur, before his sacking as manager on 17 December. None of this can fill United fans and the club\u2019s latest crop with hope. Van Gaal deserves credit for blooding 14 academy players during his two seasons in charge. To the 10 already mentioned can be added Saidy Janko, Reece James, Tom Thorpe and Jesse Lingard. Only Janko, Thorpe and James have left Old Trafford, so Mourinho has an 11-strong pool of hungry youngsters to assess when he arrives. Not all can or will make it, of course. But Van Gaal\u2019s parting gifts include the first-team regulars Rashford and Lingard, who scored Saturday\u2019s memorable volley against Crystal Palace to claim the FA Cup, plus Borthwick-Jackson, Fosu-Mensah, McNair and Varela as bona fide squad members. The Cup may have been United\u2019s first trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, but a new wave of players who could be a telling part of the club\u2019s story during the next decade perhaps counts as Van Gaal\u2019s greatest legacy. Mourinho is highly intelligent and a shrewd operator. It would seem absurd if the claims of Rashford, Lingard, et al were ignored, but the experience of Adnan Januzaj offers caution. He was handed Ryan Giggs\u2019s No11 shirt when Van Gaal arrived. Since then he has sunk virtually without trace.",
