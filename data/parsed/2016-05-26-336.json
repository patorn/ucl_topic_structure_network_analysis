  "body": "He wore a mask but the accent was unmistakable. The man in the al-Qaida tape \u2013 bellowing, \u201cas we are killed, you will be killed\u201d \u2013 was Australian. And his appearance in the April 2005 video sparked an international police race to identify him.   Related: Police believe former Australian soldier joined Taliban and is now in Syria    Greg recognised the masked man immediately. \u201cI had a gut feeling. The way he was using his hands to point, his body movements, even right down to the way he was holding his weapon,\u201d he says. \u201cI just knew it was Mathew.\u201d The Australian federal police moved in November to issue an arrest warrant for Mathew Stewart, a former soldier who vanished while travelling in central Asia in August 2001.  Internal police documents released under freedom-of-information laws in April revealed the 39-year-old is thought to have entered Afghanistan from Iran and taken up arms with the Taliban. In October he resurfaced again, this time in Syria, where police believe he helps train fighters for the jihadist militia Jabhat al-Nusra.      Mathew Stewart vanished when on holiday in central Asia in 2001, later surfacing in an al-Qaida propaganda video. He is now believed to be training militants in Syria.    Such a senior responsibility suggests Stewart is no longer the drug-addled drifter who left Australia 15 years ago. He has earned the trust of the central command of one of the world\u2019s foremost terrorist organisations. The mad surfer from Mooloolaba is likely the most senior member of al-Qaida Australia has ever produced. Few are as surprised by the Queenslander\u2019s transformation as the men he trained and toured East Timor with as a private in the Australian army. Guardian Australia has interviewed several of Stewart\u2019s former army colleagues, who recalled the young soldier\u2019s steady unravelling from drug abuse, his experiences in East Timor, and relentless bullying by two of his section commanders. The men, all since retired from the army, are torn between revulsion at Stewart\u2019s acts and an enduring sense of comradeship with a man they insist \u201chad nothing dark in him\u201d.  \u201cI hate what he\u2019s doing \u2026 But we can\u2019t hate him,\u201d one of Stewart\u2019s former army mates says. \u201cI do love Stewie,\u201d another agrees. \u201c[But] if it came down to it, and it was between me and him in Afghanistan? I\u2019d shoot him.\u201d Five months before Stewart\u2019s Delta company, part of 2RAR battalion, landed in East Timor to spearhead a UN peacekeeping force, it took part in a training exchange in Malaysia. It was the 23-year-old\u2019s first visit to an Islamic country. \u201cMathew absolutely hated Muslims. He despised them,\u201d recalls Ben, a former member of his company who, like the others, asked that his surname not be published.    He was so committed to the job. All he wanted was to be a soldier. I think it gave him some credibility.  Former army colleague     The feeling was widespread among the young men, observing up close an unfamiliar culture. \u201cBut [Stewart] was probably the most vocal, he saw it as a very domineering religion and culture,\u201d Ben says. Stewart was popular in the unit. \u201cHe was exceedingly friendly,\u201d Ben says. \u201cOne guy had his car break down, and Stewie lent him his car for I don\u2019t know how many months. That\u2019s just the sort of guy he was.\u201d Reece, who also served alongside Stewart, agrees. \u201cThere was nothing dark in him,\u201d he says. \u201cMathew was that kid who was always willing, the first one to volunteer.\u201d Members of the unit were aware Stewart had \u201cpartied hard\u201d before joining the army. \u201cHe obviously had some issues,\u201d Ben says. \u201cHe had done a lot of hard drugs when he was younger, he was right into surfing and that culture. His home life was pretty rocky to say the least.\u201d \u201cHe was just a normal kid that wanted a change,\u201d Reece says. \u201cHe was so committed to the job. All he wanted was to be a soldier. I think it gave him some credibility.\u201d Each of the men contacted by Guardian Australia raised Stewart\u2019s treatment by two superiors inside the company. \u201cI and a lot of blokes feel as though he was treated wrongly by [them],\u201d Greg says. \u201cIt was torment. Mental torment.\u201d \u201cHe was constantly made a target by these stronger personalities, larger figures,\u201d Ben says. \u201cHe was constantly given shit jobs. Sleep is one your critical resources out there, and you always want more time in bed. But Stewie would be left on gun pickets for extra time, get verbally abused.\u201d \u201cIt just broke his fucking heart, basically,\u201d Reece says. \u201cHe was incensed about it, upset. Asking, \u2018Why are they picking on me?\u2019 \u201cThey were fucking arseholes, to put it plainly,\u201d he says.     Stewart after he joined the Taliban in August 2001    They say the mistreatment in the \u201cdysfunctional unit\u201d continued throughout the training exchange and in Timor, where Stewart served six months from September 1999. \u201cHe had a bit of a stutter, but he developed more of a stutter,\u201d Ben says. \u201cHe had a big scar on his chin and he constantly used to rub that with his forefinger all the time. It was a nervous twitch.\u201d \u201cHe had two corporals steal every bit of confidence he had in himself,\u201d Reece says. \u201cI\u2019m not bashing up the army. It\u2019s individuals in the army who get away with things that they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d    The conditions [in East Timor] were bad. Once we got back we were pretty troubled souls  Former colleague     East Timor was an arduous deployment. \u201cWe saw bodies hanging from a noose that had been out there for weeks,\u201d Greg recalls. \u201cHuman remains in a well that you\u2019d been taking water out of for showers.\u201d Reece lost 20kg over the course of his first tour. \u201cThe conditions were bad,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was Australia\u2019s first deployment since Vietnam. It wasn\u2019t organised. It wasn\u2019t smooth.  \u201cOnce we got back we were pretty troubled souls,\u201d Greg says.  Only since 2002 has mandatory psychological screening been carried out on Australian soldiers returning from combat. \u201cWe were fed beer, that was our decompression,\u201d Reece says. \u201cThen we were turned loose on leave.\u201d Stewart began to disintegrate on his return to Australia. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t good,\u201d Reece says. He was sharing a house in Townsville with other soldiers. \u201cThere were cigarette burns on the coffee table. He was smoking weed, he was doing stronger drugs. It was almost like he was having a last hurrah.\u201d His stutter worsened. \u201cHe was twitchy, very unsure of himself constantly questioning,\u201d Ben says. \u201cConstantly seeking approval from his friends, peers, superiors. It never stopped.\u201d There was only the faintest clue of the path Stewart would take just over a year later. He never talked politics, but \u201che said something funny to me once\u201d, Reece recalls. \u201cHe was talking anti-American. There\u2019s big trouble coming, America\u2019s this and that. It was strange for the time.\u201d Days before Stewart left Townsville to get psychiatric help in Brisbane (he would eventually be discharged on health grounds), Greg walked into his house unannounced. \u201cI found him by himself, bed full of needles, incoherent,\u201d he says.  Reece was the last of the trio to see Stewart. It was \u201cearly or mid 2001\u201d, he says. At the time he was taking language courses ahead of a second tour of East Timor. \u201cI spoke to Mathew at his mum\u2019s place. I asked him how he was. He seemed more focused then, he wasn\u2019t drinking. It seemed as though he had a plan.\u201d It is likely that by this time Stewart\u2019s interest in militant Islam had already been stoked. He told a Turkish journalist in 2010 it was sparked some months before, when he encountered a picture online of the Chechen militiaman Ibn Al-Khattab. \u201c[In] Khattab\u2019s gaze I saw the peace of mind I do not see in any human being,\u201d he said, according to a police translation.  When the first video of Stewart surfaced in 2005, \u201cwe all couldn\u2019t believe it\u201d, Ben says. \u201cWe were taken aback and amazed. We honesty didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ended up like that, considering all the hate he had for Muslims and Islam back then.\u201d   Related: Can Pakistan win its war against the Taliban?    Ben too recognised Stewart instantly for his frame, voice and mannerisms. With one difference: he didn\u2019t stutter. Stewart\u2019s former comrades bear surprisingly few grudges towards him, even Ben and Reece, who later served in Afghanistan. \u201cWhat happened to Mathew stuck with me throughout my career. He was honestly a guy who was loved by many and hated by two,\u201d says Reece. \u201cI hate what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019ve lost friends in the past 15 years that we\u2019ve all gone through, and he\u2019s probably contributed to that. And a lot of us feel that. But we can\u2019t hate him. If you knew what he was like, you\u2019d understand.\u201d They hope by speaking out they can raise awareness of mental health issues among soldiers. \u201cI owe it Mathew, I owe it to his family to say something,\u201d Reece says. Greg agrees. \u201cThere needs to be closure, there needs to be accountability.\u201d  Did you serve with Mathew Stewart, or do you know more about this story?
