Related: Harm patients? Junior doctors are striking to\u00a0protect them | Stephen Fabes    Rosena Allin-Khan, who is also deputy leader of Wandsworth council\u2019s Labour group, has said she wants to make the byelection \u201ca referendum on this Tory government\u2019s failures \u2013 especially the NHS\u201d.  The mother-of-two is a junior doctor, although as an A&E specialist she worked to provide cover through the January strikes against the government\u2019s reorganisation of the health service. It is not clear whether she joined the all-out strikes last month.  Allin-Khan was chosen on Saturday at a meeting of the Tooting constituency party, following interviews with Labour\u2019s national executive council on Wednesday.     From the doorstep in the morning to the Tooting NHS front line on the Sunday late shift! Amazing team #Tooting pic.twitter.com/QdJndbRtYM\u2014 Rosena Allin-Khan (@DrRosena) April 17, 2016    Commenting on her selection, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cLabour has selected a great candidate to fight the Tooting byelection. Rosena Allin-Khan is a local doctor who is committed to defending local NHS services.\u201d In her campaign literature, she makes much of her mixed Polish and Pakistani heritage and her working class roots.  In a leaflet, she says: \u201cComing from a working class, mixed Polish-Pakistani background, I am a product of all that Tooting stands for \u2013 tolerance, diversity and hard work. I went to Trinity St Mary School and my mum had to hold down three jobs to make ends meet \u2013 to support me and my younger brother. \u201cThanks to my mother\u2019s hard work and changes implemented by a Labour government, I was able to go to a good school and then go on to study medicine at university. I\u2019ve now chosen to raise my own young family here in Tooting while working as an emergency doctor at St George\u2019s A&E department.\u201d Allin-Khan has said she is well placed to tackle the government over its NHS policies, which have proved unpopular and led to one of the most significant \u2013 and well supported \u2013 series of walkouts since the miners\u2019 strike in the 1980s.    Supporting all junior doctors! We will not risk lives! The new contract is not safe for patients. @WandswrthLabour pic.twitter.com/pR66lB42la\u2014 Rosena Allin-Khan (@DrRosena) April 7, 2016    \u201cAs a doctor I\u2019ve seen firsthand the effects that this government is having on our NHS,\u201d her campaign leaflet says. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly inspiring to have the support of so many Labour party members as we\u2019ve stood on the picket line. \u201cMy frontline experience allows me to show how Jeremy Hunt\u2019s attacks on junior doctors will impact the service we are able to give. I will hold him to account, ensuring our action is amplified in parliament.\u201d The Tory candidate for the 16 June byelection is Dan Watkins, who lost to Khan in 2015 by just 2,842 votes, despite local activists delivering 3m pieces of literature and claiming that about 80% of their pledges turned out. In a blog on the Conservative Home website, Matthew Maxwell Scott, former chair of Tooting Conservatives, said gentrification in the area could improve his party\u2019s chances, but sounded a pessimistic note.  \u201cAs a whole, it is different but not completely transformed from the mid-1980s,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEqually, the changes in the more Labour-inclined parts of the constituency around Tooting Broadway are often cosmetic. Vastly improved pubs and surprisingly posh chicken shops reflect changing tastes and higher disposable incomes, not a political metamorphosis.\u201d Corbyn met Allin-Khan in Tooting following her victory where the two shared a conversation about football. The Arsenal-supporting Labour leader was disappointed to hear the newly selected candidate is a Liverpool supporter.  Allin-Khan said she was very excited to challenge for the seat and praised the work carried out by her predecessor. \u201cSadiq Khan has left a fantastic legacy with his tireless work in he community in the last 11 years and I look forward to building upon all that he\u2019s done for community cohesion and all that he\u2019s done locally,\u201d she said.  \u201cI have a great track record in the area of campaigning tirelessly.\u201d",
