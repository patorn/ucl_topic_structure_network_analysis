J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his Liverpool players had no appetite for standing on ceremony after their European dreams were shattered by Sevilla\u2019s second-half transformation and their own inability to withstand it.   Related: Sevilla\u2019s knowhow leaves the Liverpool Europa League party to fall flat | Barney Ronay    Klopp appealed for one more show of defiance from Liverpool supporters, the dominant number inside a stadium that has brought them only European torment in 2002, 2014 and now 2016. There was none. He took every option available to cajole a comeback equal to the quarter-final victory over Borussia Dortmund, ending the game with Daniel Sturridge, Divock Origi and Christian Benteke on the pitch. Not this time. The final whistle signalled only despair for Liverpool\u2019s players and they collapsed to the turf en masse. The final step was in sight, Sturridge\u2019s exquisite finish had delivered a deserved lead, but they faltered badly and produced a reverse Istanbul \u2013 a second-half implosion of three goals in 25 minutes. After Sturridge\u2019s goal Sevilla appeared on the brink of unravelling. After half-time they caused Liverpool to unravel. The champions were ruthless, precise, powerful and showed why they have never lost a Europa League tie under Unai Emery and deserve a place in the history books. K\u00e9vin Gameiro and two from the captain Coke, his first goals in the competition, inflicted a fifth consecutive cup final defeat on Klopp. The manager pointed the finger at the referee, Jonas Eriksson, for missing two handballs inside the Sevilla penalty area, disallowing a second Liverpool goal and allowing Sevilla\u2019s third. Klopp was wrong about the goals. Of greater consequence was Alberto Moreno\u2019s mistake for the Andalucian club\u2019s equaliser and his team\u2019s feeble reaction in the face of the second-half onslaught. Sevilla\u2019s hat-trick of Europa League victories, their fifth triumph in the tournament in the last 10 years, made them the first club to win three consecutive Uefa titles since Bayern Munich dominated the European Cup between 1974 and 1976. For Liverpool, it was the most deflating end to a season in which Klopp has restored belief and unity to Anfield, investing so much in cup competitions that they affected the Premier League campaign. But there will be no European football in his first full season as Liverpool manager.

Daniel Carri\u00e7o hooked a Sturridge header off the line and then somehow escaped with a clear handball 60 seconds later when intercepting Firmino\u2019s flick inside the area with an upper arm. The same player also touched a Sturridge pass into the area with his fingertips. Again not given. Simon Mignolet was untroubled in the first half and Liverpool\u2019s anxious opening was a distant memory by the time Sturridge swept them into a merited lead with a magnificent finish. Firmino and Coutinho were given far too much space as they switched play from right to left, where Liverpool\u2019s most potent striker was unmarked when he collected Coutinho\u2019s pass on the corner of the area. His closest defenders, Mariano Ferreira and Adil Rami, backed off. A fatal error, and Sturridge punished them by curling the ball just inside the far post with the outside of his left foot.

Photograph: Laurent Gillieron/EPA    Dejan Lovren, and the Liverpool bench, thought he had doubled the advantage with a towering header from James Milner\u2019s corner but Sturridge was in an offside position as he attempted to apply the final touch in front of the goalkeeper. Klopp chastised John Achterberg, Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeping coach, for leading the on-pitch celebrations while the assistant referee had his flag raised. Having taken the lead with a touch of brilliance, Liverpool gave it away carelessly 20 seconds after the restart. Moreno, the former Sevilla left-back and boyhood Sevilla fan, made a hash of clearing a crossfield ball and headed straight to Ferreira. The full-back burst through Moreno and Coutinho into the area and crossed low for Gameiro to score his eighth goal of the campaign from close range. Sevilla\u2019s leading goalscorer almost made it two when \u00c9ver Banega cut open the Liverpool defence with a precise pass and Gameiro looked certain to score until Kolo Tour\u00e9 intervened with a vital challenge. The France international should have scored when a long throw into the Liverpool area fell to the unmarked striker, but Gameiro could only scuff his volley straight at Mignolet who diverted over. Collectively, the Premier League side were disintegrating. Sevilla were now the dominant, dangerous force and they went in front when Vitolo dissected Liverpool\u2019s midfield with a series of passes followed by a twist inside Lovren. As the ball broke loose on the edge of the area Coke arrived first and swept an excellent finish around Mignolet into the bottom corner.           J\u00fcrgen Klopp defiant after Liverpool lose Europa League final to Sevilla.    Liverpool were struggling to stem Sevilla\u2019s threat and their third arrived through Coke once again. The ball was deflected into the path of the captain, who appeared offside as he controlled before beating Mignolet with a close-range finish. The ball had arrived at Coke\u2019s feet via touches off Clyne and Coutinho, however, and after a lengthy wait while Klopp, Emery and their players argued and harangued the assistant referee, Eriksson eventually awarded the goal. Another Dortmund was required. Instead, Liverpool slid tamely to a comprehensive defeat. Klopp may have turned doubters into believers at Anfield but turning Liverpool into Europa League champions was beyond him.",
