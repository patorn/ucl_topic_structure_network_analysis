The Republic of Ireland manager, an avid golfer, had earlier sought out the then 12-year-old Tom McKibbin with the message: \u201cI want to talk to you later.\u201d O\u2019Neill duly delivered a sit-down, invigorating pep talk to the young golfer. O\u2019Neill wanted to know about his aspirations and his planned route to the top. He departed with the image of McKibbin and Rory McIlroy on the final fairway of a major championship. McKibbin has pictured the same, his inspiration coming from sitting up to watch McIlroy triumph at tournaments such as the US Open of 2011. McKibbin is even a member of the Northern Ireland club McIlroy put on the map, Holywood.

And yet, endearingly, he remains modest to the point of being bashful. McIlroy, like O\u2019Neill, has taken note; the four-times major winner has been a valuable source of assistance for the most likely player yet to emerge as Northern Ireland\u2019s next golfing superstar. \u201cBecause of the local connection, I have been following Tom\u2019s progress closely and it has been great to see him enjoy such success, particularly in the United States at such a young age,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cI\u2019ve also enjoyed spending time in his company and if any of my experiences so far can have a positive influence on him, that would be fantastic. I hope to see a lot more of Tom in the future.\u201d On Wednesday, after an invite from the Rory Foundation, which is hosting the tournament, McKibbin will rub shoulders with some of golf\u2019s leading lights when participating in the Irish Open pro-am. From McIlroy, this was a wonderful touch; for the schoolboy, it is cause for huge excitement. The pair have played together in Florida, with McKibbin also inside the ropes during a warm-up day for the recent WGC Match Play Championship, gaining valuable advice from his illustrious compatriot. McIlroy clearly has more immediate aspirations but a positive legacy for golf in his home country would be highly pertinent. There are already signs of exactly that.

Photograph: Courtesy of Sara Cupples    One of several intriguing aspects of McKibbin\u2019s journey is that the US has formed such a consistent backdrop. \u201cThere are a lot more players over there, things are a lot more competitive over there,\u201d he says. \u201cI have played tournaments in America for longer than I have here because for a while there was nothing for my age group. I was always playing with older kids.\u201d Competitive matters had started closer to home, at Portmarnock, where a nine-year\u2011old McKibbin won a qualifier for the European championships. He hasn\u2019t looked back since. Johnny Foster, a widely respected coach in Northern Ireland, has overseen McKibbin\u2019s development from the age of seven. Only weeks earlier, upon a first visit to the driving range, a friend\u2019s father had noticed Tom\u2019s natural skillset. Now, Tom has a fitness programme aimed at injury prevention which he partakes in four times a week. \u201cTom is a tremendous student,\u201d says Foster. \u201cHe puts time and effort into things. His attitude is his greatest strength. He just seems to be in love with golf. I literally had a blank canvas at the start and the fact he started very early meant he didn\u2019t come with bad habits. He has now travelled a lot outside of Ireland so he realises the world is a lot bigger than just being the best guy at your golf club or in your area. \u201cIt is great when he wins and super for his confidence but I\u2019m more interested in whether he is learning. People turn the corner somewhere around late high school, early college, when the focus starts going on results. At Tom\u2019s stage it is about development; as a person, concepts of the game and life, so that when turbulence comes \u2013 and it will \u2013 he deals with it and sees it as part of his journey. If Tom enjoys it, he will stick at it and if he sticks at it, he will be successful.\u201d Given the geographical background, Foster is also well placed to pinpoint a McIlroy effect. It is clearly visible at Holywood, where 50 children of varying abilities will routinely take part in a junior medal tournament. \u201cKids are more involved now in robust coaching and competitive programmes,\u201d Foster says. \u201cRory makes golf look cool and is a tremendous ambassador; young, healthy, swing looks great. \u201c When he does something it shines a light; getting in good shape, so kids want to eat better, for example. He is a real standard bearer and that\u2019s brilliant for us in a small country. I see more kids taking up golf as their No1 sport.\u201d There is, of course, inherent danger attached to the placing of a spotlight on one so young. Promise often isn\u2019t replicated by reality, throughout sport. Where McKibbin benefits \u2013 coaching aside \u2013 is from grounded parents, Sara and Robin, and a considerate school, Belfast Royal Academy. \u201cIt is trying to find that balance between trying to keep normality and trying to let Tom achieve what he wants to achieve,\u201d Sara says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t miss an awful lot of school. Anything we try to let him compete in or think he should compete in, we try to make sure they are holidays or next to holidays so that he only misses a couple of days here and there. It has always been very clear to Tom; if the schoolwork isn\u2019t done, golf won\u2019t happen. \u201cThe school has been really supportive. We have a different balance between sport and academic work. The school recognised that Tom had already done rugby etc, he is multi-skilled, he is sociable so they exchanged the likes of football and rugby time for golf. \u201cThe only worry I have with attention is that it doesn\u2019t put too much pressure on him. But at the same time, there is nothing better than life experience and Tom is doing things none of us did when we were kids. Why shouldn\u2019t he enjoy it and soak it up?\u201d This journey has been as much of an eye-opener for mother and father as Tom himself, with the funding of trips across the Atlantic an obvious challenge. Robin previously took on jobs in Dubai and Afghanistan. \u201cGolf itself isn\u2019t expensive,\u201d Sara adds. \u201cFolk think it is an expensive hobby. Junior memberships are so reasonable. Tom\u2019s first one was \u00a380; he was there every day. Even the equipment at that stage is reasonable. \u201cThe travel can create huge pressure but the experience of going to these places is important to him because this is what he wants to do. I didn\u2019t know a good or bad golf shot when he started out but I could see his drive, obsession almost, right away.\u201d That obsession has led to a handicap of five at home and scratch in the US, and McKibbin has his sights firmly set on the Future Masters in 2016. Last year, he opened that tournament with a 65 with the follow-up of 73 and 76 \u201conly\u201d good enough for an eighth-placed finish. Beyond the Future Masters in Alabama in June, McKibbin has a landmark aim: \u201cThe Masters,\u201d he says with a smile. Something else he shares with McIlroy, then.",
