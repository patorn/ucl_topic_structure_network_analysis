  "body": "A bitterly disappointed Daniil Kvyat has said he received no explanation for his sudden dropping from the Red Bull team, only four races into the Formula One season. Kvyat, who finished ahead of his senior Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo in last year\u2019s championship and won a podium place in last month\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix, has been sent back to his old Toro Rosso team and replaced by the 18-year-old sensation Max Verstappen.   Related: Lewis Hamilton believes experience will help him overcome F1 setbacks    Speaking for the first time since his demotion following the Russian Grand Prix earlier this month, the Russian said: \u201cThere was no real explanation to be honest. If the bosses want something to happen they just make it happen.\u201d Kvyat was speaking as he sat alongside Verstappen at the official FIA press conference before Sunday\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix at the Circuit de Catalunya. He revealed he was given the news in a telephone conversation with Red Bull consultant Helmut Marko as he was relaxing watching the TV series Game of Thrones. \u201cThe decision was a bit of a shock. I was standing on the podium three weeks ago,\u201d the 22-year-old said. \u201cBut it is what it is. I have always given my answers on the track and I think nothing will change. \u201cThere are 17 races remaining. I am coming back to Toro Rosso, the team I raced for in 2014, the team I really like a lot, the team that I have felt in the past few days has given me a very warm welcome, which I\u2019m grateful for. The atmosphere in the team is very positive. I will be pushing to the absolute limit on the track and will give my answers there.\u201d Despite his podium success in the chaotic race in Shanghai, Red Bull have been disappointed by the performances of Kvyat, who only came into the team last season after a year at Toro Rosso following his GP3 title win in 2013. Essentially, Red Bull wanted to fast-track Verstappen into their top team and Kvyat\u2019s faltering form gave them the opportunity to do this sooner than expected. There was also a concern regarding Verstappen\u2019s three-year contract expiring at the end of 2017 \u2013 Ferrari and Mercedes have both shown interest in signing the driver, who looks destined to become the next big thing in the sport. Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, said: \u201cMake no mistake, Max is one of the hottest properties in Formula One. People said it was too early for Max when he got his debut at 16 but he is now one of the most exciting things in the sport. \u201cWe are privy to a lot of information going back to the start of testing and Daniil has been struggling for form against his team-mate. The race in Russia [in which Kvyat crashed into the Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel] was a catalyst but a lot more consideration went into it than one Sunday afternoon.\u201d Horner also revealed Red Bull had signed a fresh deal with Verstappen which would tie him to the team for the next few years. \u201cThis kills off the driver market as far as Red Bull is concerned,\u201d he said. Verstappen, who became the sport\u2019s youngest driver at 17 when he made his debut in last year\u2019s Australian Grand Prix, said: \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the chance they have given me. I\u2019m racing for a top team now and that is always what I wanted to do. The team have given me a lot of confidence and I\u2019m going to enjoy it. Daniel Ricciardo has a lot of experience and I will try to learn a lot from him.\u201d But it was Kvyat who did most of the talking. And he wore a bemused expression for most of the press conference. \u201cI feel like I did everything for the team, bringing in the points, doing development work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working well together, so it\u2019s a question for other people who made the decision. So I really don\u2019t see any reason.\u201d",
