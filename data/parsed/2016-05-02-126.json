Historians hundreds of years from now will refer to his \u201cObama out\u201d in the same breath as the Emancipation Proclamation and \u201cMr Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d But how did we get here, and what does it all mean? As a gesture, the mic drop signals the end of a statement so definitive that it cannot possibly be followed. It\u2019s an act of destruction, as described in Eric B and Rakim\u2019s 1987 single I Ain\u2019t No Joke: \u201cI used to let the mic smoke / Now I slam it when I\u2019m done and make sure it\u2019s broke.\u201d Notable mic-droppers over time have included everyone from Eddie Murphy to Chris Rock to the Arctic Monkeys\u2019 Alex Turner. Interestingly, fictional Barack Obama is an inveterate mic-dropper. Key & Peele sketches have depicted Obama dropping the mic, as has Saturday Night Live and, in January of this year, YouTubers the Gregory Brothers songified Obama\u2019s state of the union address and uploaded the results as Obama Mic Drop: 1999. Realistically, it was only a matter of time before the real-life Obama caught up with his make-believe counterparts. Saturday\u2019s mic drop, however, was a vast improvement on the real Obama\u2019s previous efforts. In April 2012, during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, the US president concluded a Slow Jam the News segment not by dropping the mic, but by sort of prissily flinging it to the ground, much in the way a child would if they saw a wasp on their ice-cream. However, Obama should remember to exercise caution, for the mic drop has been known to backfire. Just look at Google\u2019s April fool this year \u2013 a gif of a mic-dropping Minion that, when deployed in Gmail, blocked all replies from the recipient. Some people who used it claimed they lost their jobs as a result, and Google had to sheepishly withdraw the prank. Remember, Mr President, with great mic drops comes great responsibility.",
