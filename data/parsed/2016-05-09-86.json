Denis Baupin, an MP for the Europe \u00c9cologie Les Verts (EELV) party, strenuously denied the accusations and said his lawyers would countersue. \u201cThey are lies, defamatory and have no basis in fact,\u201d said Baupin\u2019s lawyer, Emmanuel Pierrat. Baupin, 53, is married to Emmanuelle Cosse, the current minister for housing and a former national secretary of the EELV.     Sandrine Rousseau. Photograph: Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images    Sandrine Rousseau, a former EELV spokesperson, alleged in comments made to the website Mediapart that Baupin had attacked her in October 2011 during a meeting on preparations for the presidential election the following year. \u201cI left the room and in the corridor outside, Denis Baupin came over, pushed me against the wall by my chest and tried to kiss me. I pushed him away violently,\u201d Rousseau said. Elen Debost, the deputy mayor of the city of Le Mans, claimed she had received hundreds of text messages from Baupin. She said: \u201cI felt what all women feel when they are victims of violence: they blame themselves, they feel fragile, isolated. That\u2019s all I felt at the time and it stopped me from complaining. I\u2019m not proud of not having complained.\u201d     Elen Debost, deputy mayor of Le Mans. Photograph: Jean-Francois Monier/AFP/Getty Images    Isabelle Attard, a former MP for the Calvados region, made allegations of \u201calmost daily harassment with salacious, provocative SMSs\u201d. \u201cThey came in salvos,\u201d Attard said. Cl\u00e9mentine Autain, a regional councillor for the Front de Gauche, told France Info that \u201ceveryone knew\u201d and that one of the women who accused Baupin had \u201cconfided in her\u201d certain events that she considered \u201cvery serious\u201d. Autain said the women had not come forward before because of the \u201cpolitical climate moulded by a virile world\u201d. She said: \u201cThe political world is a hunting ground in which women try to survive \u2026 [they are] isolated and don\u2019t want to be perceived as victims.\u201d The campaign group Osez le F\u00e9minisme issued a statement calling for an end to the \u201cimpunity for those in power\u201d. \u201cTo think the Denis Baupin affair is isolated is a mistake. For several years, men in politics have been implicated in affairs of violent machismo,\u201d it wrote, citing the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair as an example.  DSK, as Strauss-Kahn is known in France, was on track to become president in 2011 when he was accused of sexually assaulting a maid in a New York hotel. The case was later dropped, but his political career was over and his wife, the television presenter Anne Sinclair, divorced him. Mediapart, which published the women\u2019s claims against Baupin, said it had spent several months investigating the accusations. The women told France Inter radio, which also investigated the claims, that they had been prompted to accuse Baupin after seeing a photograph in which he and seven other male MPs posed for a photograph wearing lipstick to protest at violence against women. None of the women had complained publicly before or reported the alleged harassment to the police. As most of the accusations took place more than three years ago, they are out of time for legal proceedings.",
