  "body": "There were shocks and surprises \u2013 and even talk of a renegade jury \u2013 at the closing ceremony for the 69th Cannes film festival. Few of the perceived favourites picked up prizes, while some movies derided as turkeys triumphed \u2013 and the one-award-per-movie rule also appeared to have been torn up.   Related: I, Daniel Blake review: Ken Loach's welfare state polemic is blunt, dignified and brutally moving    Ken Loach won his second Palme d\u2019Or \u2013 the festival\u2019s highest honour \u2013 for I, Daniel Blake, a social-realist drama about a disabled carpenter struggling with the red tape of the benefits system. The director, who turns 80 next month, returned from retirement to make the film, and took to the stage at the Palais to address the audience in French.  \u201cThe festival is very important for the future of cinema,\u201d he said, instructing all present to \u201cstay strong.\u201d Loach continued by saying it was \u201cvery strange\u201d to received the award in such glamorous surroundings, considering the conditions endured by those people who inspired the film.  \u201cWhen there is despair, the people from the far right take advantage,\u201d said Loach. \u201cWe must say that another world is possible and necessary.\u201d Jury member Donald Sutherland praised I, Daniel Blake as \u201can absolutely terrific movie that resonates in your heart and soul,\u201d backstage during a press conference. Loach has a very loyal following in Europe: many of his films have premiered at Cannes, while The Wind That Shakes the Barley, about two brothers who join the IRA in the early 1920s, won the Palme d\u2019Or in 2006. Yet few foresaw victory for the veteran dramatist on Sunday.  The film-maker called his second win \u201cextraordinary\u201d backstage. \u201cOur breath has been taken away,\u201d Loach said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting to come back. We are quietly stunned.\u201d   Related: Cannes 2016: full list of winners    The prize for best director was a tie between Graduation, Cristian Mungiu\u2019s Romanian drama about a doctor\u2019s daughter struggling with her exams and Olivier Assayas\u2019s Personal Shopper, a horror starring Kristen Stewart as a recently-bereaved psychic PA in Paris. The first film was warmly \u2013 if soberly \u2013 received; the second was greeted with boos at its press screening \u2013 although not quite as many as met It\u2019s Only the End of the World, Xavier Dolan\u2019s melodrama about a young man who returns to his family to tell them he\u2019s dying.  That film took the Grand Prix \u2013 or runner\u2019s up award \u2013 marking the second time Dolan has triumphed, following 2014\u2019s Mommy. In an emotional speech, the 27-year-old French Canadian thanked his producer for \u201cfeeling the emotion of the film\u201d.   Related: It\u2019s Only the End of the World review: Xavier Dolan's nightmarish homecoming is a dream    \u201cEmotion is not always easy to share with others,\u201d he continued. \u201cViolence can sound like a scream. All we do in this world, we do to be loved. Me, especially. To be accepted. The more I grow, the more I direct, the more difficult it is to be understood. I now know who I am.\u201d Jury member L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes, the director who last year won the same prize for the Auschwitz-set drama Son of Saul, called Dolan\u2019s film \u201ca very moving journey,\u201d backstage. \u201cIt had ambition - and much risk was taken. \u201cWhen it started, you could feel a very specific voice of director,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m very happy when I see people try to go in very different and personal ways. I think that\u2019s the essence of cinema.\u201d Dolan used his time backstage to address his critics. \u201cI\u2019ll always read what people think and say,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is how I\u2019ve been building my life - I\u2019ve been wondering what people think. If they see black when I see white, there\u2019s a problem.\u201d Meanwhile British film-maker Andrea Arnold won her third Jury Prize (after Red Road and Fish Tank) for American Honey, a lyrical road-trip across the US. Many had anticipated a more substantial award for the film which, alongside Maren Ade\u2019s Toni Erdmann, was considered one of the frontrunners. \u201cWhen I\u2019m happy I want to dance,\u201d said Arnold in a speech in which she thanked her team. Asghar Farhadi\u2019s The Salesman \u2013 a quiet thriller about an actor wrestling with his desire for vengeance after his wife is assaulted in their flat \u2013 took best actor for Shahab Hosseini and best screenplay for the writer/director. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting a second award for the film,\u201d said Fahardi on stage.  Jaclyn Jose won best actress for her role as an impoverished mother fighting police corruption in Brilliante Mendoza\u2019s Manilla-set crime thriller Ma Rosa. She took expressed shock. \u201cI am so surprised,\u201d she said on stage. \u201cI just walked the red carpet with my daughter.\u201d Jose thanked the festival before dedicating her award \u201cto the Philippines\u201d. \u201cWe found her to be a master of her skills,\u201d said jury member Mads Mikkelsen, backstage, of their decision to award Jose. \u201cIt was a beautiful performance for a lead actress. That\u2019s why she got it.\u201d The jury this year was chaired by Mad Max director George Miller, whose Fury Road was one of the breakthrough films of last year\u2019s festival.    Related: Cannes 2016: Ken Loach wins Palme d'Or \u2013 the Dailies film podcast    His fellow jurors included Nemes, as well as actors including Sutherland, Kirsten Dunst and Vanessa Paradis. Speaking at the start of the ceremony, Miller described the previous fortnight as \u201cexhausting, but one of the best experiences of my life\u201d. \u201cWe must commend the festival for this feast of cinema,\u201d he said. \u201cWe passionately and fiercely debated the films. Nothing was left unsaid.\u201d Backstage speaking to the press, Miller echoed his sentiments made at the ceremony, calling the experience of leading his jury \u201crigorous and vigorous.\u201d \u201cArguably we debated longer than most juries,\u201d he added. \u201cNothing was left unsaid. And we avoided looking at what other people were saying.\u201d Divines \u2013 about a teenage girl in the Paris suburbs, commended as a successor to La Haine \u2013 won the Camera d\u2019Or for best debut. Its director, Houda Benyamina, used her time onstage to ebulliently cheerlead for more female directors.  \u201cCannes is ours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are here! It\u2019s possible. The fact that a woman won the prize is a curiosity; things have to change. It\u2019s about time.\u201d Benyamina then paid tribute to her female producer, before crying out \u201cAnother woman!\u201d and \u201cVive directors!\u201d The honorary Palme went to Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, the veteran French actor best known for his work with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. L\u00e9aud, now 71, played the character Antoine Doinel in a series of films by the New Wave icon, starting with 1959\u2019s The 400 Blows. The juror Arnaud Desplechin made emotional tribute in his introduction, which was followed by a prolonged standing ovation.  In his speech, L\u00e9aud remarked: \u201cCinema is the only art the captures death at work, like bees we can see dying in a hive.\u201d Despite the unexpected end, the verdict on this year\u2019s festival was that it passed without the cinematic fireworks of some previous editions, with fewer films debuting on the Croisette likely to be loom large in the awards conversation. Yet the relative peace outside the Palais was a triumph, with heightened security and 500 extra policemen apparently fending off any terrorist threat.",
