The BBC took BBC Three off our TV screens recently as it moves online to further target that lucrative 16-24 demographic. The BBC Trust claimed that there was \u201cclear public value in moving BBC Three online, as independent evidence shows younger audiences are watching more online and watching less linear TV\u201d. As made evident by their Twitter feed, many in the country have been left slightly confused by this move. Maybe they\u2019re right to do this, or maybe it\u2019s a mistake. Only time will tell. But the idea is part of a broader sense that young people live the vast majority of their lives on the internet. We don\u2019t care about the BBC, we care about Netflix. Stuff ITV, let\u2019s talk about YouTube. And again, maybe they\u2019re right. I don\u2019t have Netflix, but while I was initially a little upset about BBC Three moving online I quickly realised that I don\u2019t often consume content on a \u201clinear basis\u201d from the BBC: I watch/listen/read it on-demand. The last time I remember sitting down and watching something in the slot it was actually scheduled was back in 2012, when the Olympics were in London. Anything else and it\u2019s on demand.

If someone came up to you and told you that you could store thousands of books on a device that weighed less than one of those books, and you were a devout book lover, let\u2019s be honest: you\u2019d would take it. And the Kindle works wonders for baggage allowances. Imagine: taking more books than your local library onto an aeroplane and still being within your baggage allowance! But it\u2019s worth remembering that, against all odds, the sale of physical books is on the up and the sale of digital books is falling. A lot. Maybe you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, adults and young children read books too! No evidence to say that teens aren\u2019t going digital\u201d. Hah. Well\u2026 A survey carried out for the Bookseller Children\u2019s Conference in 2015 claims that 16-24 year olds (the same demographic that BBC Three went online to reach, remember) prefer physical books to digital books, with 64% saying print books were their favourite and 20% saying they didn\u2019t mind. While teens may well be more likely to embrace e-books than those of an older age demographic, I think that\u2019s a really clear indication that we\u2019re not shifting wholesale away from tradition \u2013 not when it comes to books anyway.   Related: How ebooks made me an adventurous reader \u2013 and a published author    People have their different reasons for this. For me personally, one of the many reasons I\u2019m still more than happy to splurge most of my money in Waterstones is not only the smell of new books (intoxicating though that is), but also the feeling of actually holding a book, and being able to actually have a page turner. You can\u2019t smell a Kindle \u2013 you\u2019re holding plastic \u2013 and tapping an e-ink screen to turn a page isn\u2019t really the same being able to turn a page. Sure, I love the internet. It\u2019s great. I am more than happy to make use of it, searching for new books to buy and adding them to wishlists so when I have the money I\u2019ll go straight back and order it. I\u2019ll spend great tacts of time watching YouTube videos, writing blog posts, or just procrastinating. And the internet is undoubtedly where I consume most of my visual content, using services like YouTube or iPlayer to do so.   Related: E-readers vs books: the debate    But that\u2019s not the same as the assumption that everything people my age do is filtered through the digital sphere. I\u2019m still able, in my school, to have a conversation with someone about what was on TV last night. We\u2019re not at all disillusioned with traditional mediums of print and publishing; I\u2019m still more than happy to read something that\u2019s written on paper, be that a book or a newspaper, and whilst emails and WhatsApp and these new digital means of communication are useful, nothing\u2019s stopping me from enjoying receiving a letter. Sometimes, innovation just doesn\u2019t beat tradition. No doubt about it, the world is turning increasingly digital. By the end of this year, it\u2019s estimated there will be around 2.13 billion global social media accounts. There are currently 44 million Netflix accounts around the world at the moment. The BBC reported that in January 2016 iPlayer had 315 million requests for TV and radio content, a 2% month-on-month increase. But that doesn\u2019t mean we have no time for tradition any more \u2013 and I suspect books will live longer than most.
