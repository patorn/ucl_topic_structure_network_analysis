  "body": "Russell T Davies has defended cutting Shakespeare and said he would not countenance keeping a female character declaring she would kill herself for love. Davies\u2019 version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is broadcast on BBC1 on Monday evening. He told Hay festival that he has cut boldly, and not just more obviously extraneous lines. He has cut Helena saying to Demetrius \u201ctreat me as your spaniel\u201d and how she would rather die than not be loved. \u201cI\u2019ve got to put my name on this and I don\u2019t care what Shakespeare was thinking, I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s my name on it,\u201d Davies said. \u201cIt [a woman threatening to kill herself for love] was kind of standard in the 1590s, it is not standard now. I\u2019m deliberately hoping to get young girls watching this and I will not transmit lines in which women are so much in love that they are threatening to commit suicide.\u201d   Related: Hay festival: Shakespeare experts clash over whether to cut, or not to cut    Davies, who spoke on the fourth day of the festival in Wales, took exception to one person who asked whether he would also cut Juliet\u2019s death scene in Romeo and Juliet. Davies responded that in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream he had taken out what was a fleeting reference, whereas Romeo and Juliet \u201cis entirely about that moment. I\u2019m disappointed frankly with that question\u201d. The programme is only 90 minutes long so cuts were inevitable, Davies added. He conceded taking lots of scene-setting lines out: great poetry, he admitted \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean it ceases to exist\u201d by cutting it. The writer estimated that he changed five words because they did not rhyme after his cutting, adding: \u201cI hope it is done with a lot of respect.\u201d Cutting Shakespeare is a lively debate in what is the 400th anniversary of his death. The new artistic director of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe theatre, Emma Rice, has said she will cut lines audiences might not understand. The deputy artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Erica Whyman, however, told the festival last week that she gets furious when lines are cut for that reason.         A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream trailer    Davis said the truth was that all companies cut lines, make changes and reinvent Shakespeare plays. He said he had had no battles with Shakespeare purists and questioned whether they even exist, as every production was different.  There is no definitive version, he said. \u201cIt is wonderful to change, and anyone who thinks you can\u2019t change stuff like this will simply have life and time and culture drown them.\u201d Similar to the current Shakespeare\u2019s Globe production \u2013 where Helen is Helenus, a gay man \u2013 Davies has added a gay aspect to his version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. There is a same-sex relationship between Demetrius and Lysander, and Titania, played by Maxine Peake, kisses a woman. Davies said: \u201cIt is hilarious that people get up in arms with Titania kissing a woman and they are perfectly happy about her kissing a donkey!\u201d Peake joined Davies at the packed Hay event and spoke of how she struggled with Shakespeare for years.   Related: Maxine Peake to star in A Streetcar Named Desire in Manchester    She recalled watching Roman Polanski\u2019s Macbeth at school and having no idea what was going on. \u201cIt was drummed into me, \u2018Keep away from it, it\u2019s too complicated\u2019. I always kept that with me, a fear of it, which I think a lot of people do. If you don\u2019t grasp it at school and don\u2019t get that opportunity to enjoy it \u2026 it\u2019s just words, that\u2019s all it is.\u201d Peake told how she played Ophelia opposite Christopher Ecclestone\u2019s Hamlet 12 years ago and felt out of her depth. Her Shakespeare breakthrough came when she played Hamlet at the Manchester international festival in 2012. \u201cNow I love it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt to love it and I\u2019ve learnt my way to do it.\u201d Davies\u2019s Dream is a key part of the BBC\u2019s Shakespeare season and he paid tribute to the broadcaster as the only company he would have approached. It was filmed in Cardiff by the team behind Doctor Who, the series he successfully reinvented. Coming up next, he said, is \u201cHawking\u201d \u2013 an idea for a six-part drama about living with Aids in the 1980s. Peake, meanwhile, is to return to the Manchester Royal Exchange to play Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire.",
