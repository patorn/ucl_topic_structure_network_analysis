  "body": "It\u2019s 1980. The air is thick with testosterone, Aramis aftershave and the musk of well-used jockstraps. On the face of it, Richard Linklater\u2019s latest picture, which unfolds during a riotous three days before the college term starts, has more in common with National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House than it does with the gentle, observational style of Boyhood. But dig a little deeper, and this joyously hedonistic semi-autobiographical comedy, which has been described as a \u201cspiritual sequel\u201d to Dazed and Confused, is unmistakably a Linklater movie. It\u2019s a film that takes a seismic rite of passage \u2013 the journey from being a high-school big shot to a freshman little fish in a pool of immense, ravenous ego-driven sharks \u2013 and explores it without the framework of one large dramatic inciting incident to hang it on. Instead, like all of Linklater\u2019s best pictures and some of his worst, the film is driven by dialogue. And there are few writer-directors who have a better ear for authentic voices than Linklater. His ear for music is equally attuned \u2013 the soundtrack speaks of the malleable identities of boys who will pledge temporary allegiance to any social group if it gets them near the girls.           Richard Linklater on Everybody Wants Some!!: \u2018Directing is like being a coach\u2019    The film follows Jake (Blake Jenner), a freshman pitcher who joins the fictional South Texas State University as a member of the baseball team. This buys him a place in one of the baseball houses, a dilapidated frat-like building that can barely contain all the alpha-male jock arrogance jostling for position within its creaking walls. Everything \u2013 even banter \u2013 becomes a competition. The picture works best if you reserve judgment \u2013 yes, some of the attitudes towards women are a little unreformed and some of the characters are puddle deep \u2013 and enjoy the show. What\u2019s most interesting, perhaps, is the way that Linklater rehabilitates the jock as a character. Traditionally viewed \u2013 by everyone from John Hughes onwards \u2013 as muscle-bound bullies each with an IQ barely above that of the boots they wear, here they are as diverse and (occasionally) complex as any other section of the college community.",
