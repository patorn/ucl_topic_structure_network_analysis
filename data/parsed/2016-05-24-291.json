  "body": "Russell T Davies wanted to replicate the nostalgia he harnessed in the reboot of Doctor Who for his production of Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, and even asked the 10th Doctor and Shakespeare veteran David Tennant for advice on the adaptation. The former Doctor Who showrunner said Tennant hadn\u2019t been available to star in the adaptation, which is part of celebrations of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death.  \u201cWhen I embarked on this production, I scrolled down my phone to seek the advice of the greatest expert in Shakespeare I know, David Tennant,\u201d Davies wrote in the Radio Times. \u201cSadly, he wasn\u2019t free to appear in this production \u2013 he would have made a great Moth \u2013 but he suggested some brilliant jokes. When you see the gag with Bernard Cribbins and a handpump, that\u2019s copyright DT.\u201d \u201cThe ghost of Doctor Who was invoked deliberately. When I brought that show back in 2005, I wanted to make it feel brand new, but I also wanted to stir that ancestral memory of something once loved. And I think A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is the same. It wasn\u2019t just my school putting on a production, it was 100,000 schools. This is the kids\u2019 play.\u201d The BBC1 adaptation of Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, which will broadcast next Monday evening, starred Maxine Peake as fairy queen Tatiana, Matt Lucas as Bottom, John Hannah as King Thesus, Richard Wilson as Starveling and former Doctor Who star Bernard Cribbins as Snout. Among many updates to the play, Davies has introduced a kiss between two female characters, Peake\u2019s Tatiana, and Queen Hippolyta (played by Utopia\u2019s Eleanor Matsuura). He has defended the kiss, saying that \u201cit\u2019s 2016\u201d and he \u201cwanted children to watch this and see the real world in the middle of this fantasy\u201d.",
