  "body": "Clive Palmer will not stand for election to the House of Representatives in his Queensland seat of Fairfax, but his Palmer United party will contest Senate elections in every state \u2013 leaving the option that Palmer will run for the upper house. He told the parliament that he had been attacked by the media and the major parties for an \u201cimproper purpose\u201d. Palmer has come under sustained criticism lately, particularly over the liquidation of his company Queensland Nickel.   Related: Queensland Nickel liquidators pursue $300m from Clive Palmer's companies    While he did not confirm whether he would run for the Senate, Palmer will have a media conference on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI have been attacked over the last three years by a centrally controlled media which is supportive of the two-party system which is a danger to democracy,\u201d he said. Palmer accused the treasurer, Scott Morrison, of becoming more like a \u201cpublic servant\u201d, bringing down a budget that did very little. He also accused the Coalition of wanting to destroy \u201cthis country and its infrastructure\u201d. Palmer claimed credit, though his senators, of overturning much of Tony Abbott\u2019s 2014 budget.   Related: Lisa Wilkinson tells Clive Palmer, 'Australia thinks you're a joke'    He reminded the parliament of his \u201cAl Gore moment\u201d, when he brought the climate campaigner and former US vice-president to Australia. Palmer voted to cut the carbon tax but keep the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and maintain the Renewable Energy Target (RET).  \u201cPalmer United will fight to get balance of power in the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe I have the courage today to leave the House of Representatives, satisfied with what Palmer United party has done and knowing it would have been a different Australia if we hadn\u2019t stopped the 2014 budget and the Newman government in Queensland. \u201cWe need to praise the incorruptibility of our public officials, the integrity of our marriages and worth of our people. It\u2019s ideas that matter.\u201d",
