  "body": "Aldi is to introduce 18 British craft beers at its stores as it capitalises on the bank holiday weekend. Amid heightened demand for specialist beers, the discount supermarket chain will stock its shelves with brews such as Wet Your Whistle, White Witch and A-Hop-alypse Now from Sunday. It said the move would allow it to tap into a UK craft beer market worth \u00a3420m and predicted to reach \u00a31bn by 2020. The German retailer spent the past two years sourcing the beers from 15 UK-based breweries, before selling them for \u00a31.25 each in stores in England and Wales.   Related: The aggressive, outrageous, infuriating (and ingenious) rise of BrewDog    It added that the range was \u201ccarefully selected to celebrate provenance, artisan brewing and the exceptional beer produced across the UK\u201d. The breweries chosen include Wiltshire-based Wadworth, a fourth-generation family business that delivers ales locally in oak casks by shire horses. Tony Baines, Aldi\u2019s joint managing director of corporate buying, said the ales on offer were an eclectic mix and would be on sale at affordable prices. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be supporting the growth of some of the most distinguished regional breweries and microbreweries across the country,\u201d he added.
