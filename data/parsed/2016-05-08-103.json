The chancellor is due to publish Treasury research about the short-term costs of Brexit in the coming days, and has revealed that one key finding will be that property prices could fall if voters decide to leave the EU on 23 June. Speaking on the first episode of ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday, the chancellor said: \u201cYou will see the analysis we will do, but I\u2019m pretty clear that there will be a significant hit to the value of people\u2019s homes and to the costs of mortgages. That is one example of the kind of impact, economic impact, that we get from leaving the EU.\u201d   Related: Should we stay or should we go? UK businesses on the EU referendum    Osborne also took on the argument of his colleague, the justice secretary, Michael Gove, who had said earlier on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, that he hoped Britain would leave the European single market. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had the leave campaign admit this morning that Britain would leave the single market \u2013 that is the largest free trade area in the world. That would be catastrophic for people\u2019s jobs and their incomes and their livelihoods. Now, some people might think wrecking the economy is a price worth paying. I absolutely reject that,\u201d the chancellor said. The referendum campaign is expected to take on new life this week, as Labour and the Conservatives switch their attention from last week\u2019s elections to the looming decision over Britain\u2019s future in the EU.

But Osborne, widely seen as a potential future party leader, said he did not expect any contest to be held until \u201cthe end of the decade\u201d. Cameron has said he will not serve a third term as prime minister. \u201cI\u2019m a very happy, content member of David Cameron\u2019s team. I fought very hard to get my friend elected as leader of the Conservative party, then elected as the prime minister of this country and I\u2019m very happy being part of that team that is bringing change to this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a leadership election at the end of this decade. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do before then\u201d.  With debate within the party raging about what even senior insiders saw as a divisive campaign for the London mayoralty by the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, who lost out to Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan, Osborne added that he favoured what he called the \u201cmoderate, compassionate Conservative party that appeals to the moderate mainstream of this country, that offers sober, serious, principled answers to the big problems the country faces\u201d.",
