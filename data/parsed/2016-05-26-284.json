  "body": "Later this week, Lou Armour, a special needs teacher, and Gabriel Sagastume, a retired criminal prosecutor, will stand shoulder to shoulder on a stage at the Brighton festival. Thirty-four years ago, they were in the Falklands, fighting on opposite sides. If they had met then, they might have tried to kill each other; now when they meet, they hug. Armour and Sagastume, along with four other Falklands veterans, have been brought together by Argentinian theatre-maker Lola Arias to create Minefield, a piece of documentary theatre co-commissioned by the London international festival of theatre. Like Arias\u2019s previous, celebrated shows, it treats individual lives as historical documents that can tell us much, often more than any history book.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    In The Year I was Born, Arias approached nine Chileans, all born between 1976 and 1984, the years of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship, and asked them to investigate their own family histories and mythologies, sometimes with devastating results. One participant discovered that the father she had always been told was dead was in fact in prison for his role in the murder of two of Pinochet\u2019s political opponents. The way that personal lives are shaped by public events was also explored in My Life After, which excavated the consequences of the Argentinian dictatorship on those whose parents had differing ideological positions. Minefield, which transfers to London\u2019s Royal Court after its Brighton dates, presents a different challenge, as it takes the veterans back in time to the young men they were in 1982. Arias has been struck, however, by how little conflict has emerged. She points to the fact that while both the Argentinian and British governments may continue to take a stand  on the sovereignty of the Falklands or Malvinas, the people who went to fight there were not defending a personal ideology, but simply doing a job for their country.     Lola Arias\u2019s The Year I Was Born. Photograph: David Alarc\u00f3n    \u201cThe moments of conflict have often been more around their desire to remember and honour the dead and the reputation of the regiments they fought for,\u201d Arias says. \u201cThey keep asking why we haven\u2019t included key moments such as the battle for Goose Green, and I tell them that we are not writing a history book but dealing in personal memory and if you weren\u2019t at Goose Green then it is not part of your memory. You are representing yourself on stage, not your country or your battalion.\u201d It\u2019s memory as a minefield that has fascinated Arias in so much of her work and which takes centre stage in this piece, which takes the men back in time and makes them consider recollections which have either become burnished through frequent retelling or have remained buried and unacknowledged. \u201cWhen you start to remember, you never know what you will find,\u201d says Arias, \u201csometimes something explodes that you didn\u2019t even know was there.\u201d As part of the ongoing creative process \u2013 which has lasted longer than the Falklands war itself; the conflict was over in 74 days \u2013 she asked the men to keep diaries charting their thoughts and feelings about revisiting the past. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite challenging at times,\u201d says Armour, who quietly acknowledges that he has been unexpectedly ambushed by some of the feelings that have arisen. It\u2019s been the same for some of the others: Ruben Otero, who now makes a living in a Beatles tribute band, has had to relive surviving the sinking of the General Belgrano, in which 323 of his comrades died; Marcello Vallejo, now a triathlon champion, is brutally honest about how his Falklands experience fuelled a period of substance abuse, now long behind him.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    \u201cAn integral part of the process is dealing with what comes out,\u201d says Arias, \u201cand deciding what will and won\u2019t appear in the piece. I create text from what they tell me and then I give it back to them and they decide whether it will or won\u2019t go in, and they can always change their minds at any point, even once we are performing it. They have the power. In the end the authorship of all my pieces is a shared responsibility, because all of us are involved in the process.\u201d Arias is acutely conscious that we are all constantly authoring our own life stories and the act of retelling them creates constant modifications, so that every true life story is a kind of fiction.  Her aim is to get beyond the \u201crecited\u201d version \u2013 particularly those involving trauma and tragedy \u2013 that is often constructed as a form of self-protection. \u201cWe go back to the very beginning and reconstruct their memories and stories. It can take hours to get just a single minute of material. You have to be very patient, because it can be painful and difficult,\u201d says Arias. She acknowledges that the process sounds a little like mining, only it\u2019s memory rather than ore or gems that is being extracted. But it\u2019s just as precious, perhaps even more so. \u201cWhat you discover is how far the past and present co-exist in all our lives and how much what once happened to us has an influence on who and what we are now. Whether we acknowledge it or not. This play is like a time machine. We see these men as they are now in their 50s and we also catch a glimpse of their younger selves, those young men in their late teens and early 20s who went to war.\u201d She smiles: \u201cSometimes I catch myself looking at them and find it very difficult to imagine them on the battlefield, when I see who they are now.\u201d \u2022 At Brighton Dome Corn Exchange, 28 and 29 May.
