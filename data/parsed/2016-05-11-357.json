  "body": "Related: Cannes 2016: big names and some great Brits swell an exciting lineup | Peter Bradshaw    On a bracingly cold December morning, a cottage complete with miniature lawn and garden trellis stands inside a studio on the outskirts of Prague. Inside, Kristen Stewart is running through a scene from the supernatural thriller Personal Shopper. Overseeing it is Olivier Assayas, the writer-director responsible for coaxing from the 26-year-old a revelatory performance in Clouds of Sils Maria. In that film, she was Val, the straight-shooting, unsentimental assistant to an insecure star played by Juliette Binoche. Stewart\u2019s work for Assayas made her the first American woman to win a C\u00e9sar award, France\u2019s equivalent of an Oscar. And word has just reached Prague that the New York Film Critics Circle have also awarded Stewart a prize. \u201cIt\u2019s a real possibility now that she could get an Oscar nomination,\u201d says Charles Gillibert, the producer of both Clouds and Personal Shopper, as we mill around on set. (She didn\u2019t.) I make a mental note to congratulate Stewart when we sit down later for a chat. However, there are bad tidings from the line producer, Sylvie Barthet. The last few days have been unexpectedly tough on Stewart, and her agent has asked that she be allowed to concentrate solely on her performance. Still, you never know: people change their minds, opportunities arise. I\u2019ll see what happens. I am given a pair of headphones and a seat in front of a monitor to watch the scene being shot. This is a pivotal moment in Stewart\u2019s career. After taking two years off following the end of the Twilight franchise, she returned with a slate of movies that signalled her intention to bury Bella for ever. In Camp X-Ray, she played a guard at Guant\u00e1namo Bay; one scene, in which a prisoner covers her in excrement, proved that she was willing to get her hands dirty, along with everything else. Then Clouds of Sils Maria stripped Stewart of her protective layers. Films with Woody Allen (Caf\u00e9 Society) and Ang Lee (Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk) have followed. It\u2019s a busy time. A breaking dawn, you might say.     Stewart and Juliette Binoche in 2014\u2019s Clouds of Sils Maria, also directed by Olivier Assayas. Photograph: Allstar/CG Cinema    In Assayas\u2019s latest picture, which he describes as a companion piece of sorts to Clouds, Stewart plays Maureen, personal shopper to the stars. She and her twin brother, Lewis, who are both mediums, have made a pact: whichever of them dies first will establish contact with the other from beyond the grave. When Lewis dies, Maureen goes to his home to wait for a sign. In the scene being shot this morning, she and Lewis\u2019s girlfriend, played by Sigrid Bouaziz, are discussing s\u00e9ances. After the fourth take, Assayas calls out: \u201cPretty good.\u201d After the fifth: \u201cA dernier.\u201d In each one, Stewart brings her trademark minimalist intensity: the angular features, the tight mouth and piercing gaze contain infinite and mysterious tensions. Her antennae seem to never stop twitching. Between takes, Bouaziz, also 26, quizzes her co-star about a word that crops up in one of her lines: tacky. \u201cIt can mean, like, cheesy,\u201d Stewart explains. \u201cI knew the word,\u201d Bouaziz tells me later, killing time between set-ups. \u201cBut I love to ask Kristen because she tells me how young people speak in English.\u201d   Related: Cannes 2014 review: Clouds of Sils Maria - blue sky thesping    Bouaziz is hauled away to inspect some furniture that will be used in the next scene. Her character is a carpenter, and the props manager has produced three chairs for her and Assayas to choose from. To the casual observer, it resembles an unusually dreary version of Goldilocks. \u201cThis one is too complicated,\u201d the director decides, rocking on the heels of his navy blue Golas. He moves on. \u201cThis one is not the right shape.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd this one is \u2026 \u201d Just right? Almost. \u201cRemove the fabric,\u201d he says thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s 80% there.\u201d \u201cThere are studios in Hollywood asking Olivier to make films,\u201d Gillibert tells me over coffee. \u201cHe can do whatever he wants. He\u2019s making European cinema.\u201d He sees a parallel between Assayas and Stewart. \u201cLike Olivier, Kristen challenges herself. I\u2019ve seen on Personal Shopper how Olivier has had to adapt himself because of what she is doing with her character. He told me: \u2018She\u2019s challenging the scenes! I thought she was going to do this, but she\u2019s doing that.\u2019 With Kristen there is nothing unimportant. Everything is made significant by what she does.\u201d When the crew breaks for lunch, I plonk myself next to Assayas as he works his way through soup and salad in the catering tent. He has shaggy silver hair and eyebrows like black tyre tracks. Stewart is sitting a few benches away, perusing texts and larking around with a friend. \u201cShe is a genius,\u201d says the 61-year-old director. \u201cShe has an instinctive understanding of cinema and an extraordinary precision in her knowledge of the frame. She is never boring \u2013 she knows how to make any shot riveting.\u201d     Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg with director Woody Allen on the set of his new film, Cafe Society. Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate    It wasn\u2019t his intention to make two consecutive films with Stewart. But when a planned US production collapsed at the last moment, he bashed out Personal Shopper. \u201cI wrote this movie really fast and it has ended up as a sort of continuation of our first film together. Clouds opened doors for me. Things I couldn\u2019t touch before I was able to do: mixing realistic and genre elements, dealing with the invisible.\u201d In both films, Stewart plays a woman on the fringes of wealth and celebrity. \u201cA personal shopper is the most alienated job you can find,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing in surfaces, but it\u2019s not even for yourself. Maureen is doing a job she doesn\u2019t like, and the film is about her trying to come to terms with her own identity. She\u2019s darker than Val. And the film is darker. Clouds can be seen as comedy. This can\u2019t.\u201d   Related: Kristen Stewart to make directorial debut with short film about female power dynamics    Stewart is outside the tent, woolly hat pulled low over her ears, cigarette in mouth. When it\u2019s time for her to make her way back at last, someone barks into a walkie-talkie: \u201cKristen is travelling.\u201d I stroll with Assayas back to the cottage. It\u2019s different directing Stewart this time, he says. \u201cEverything was filtered through Juliette before. I was not pushing Kristen to her limits. It was all about transporting her to a different area so she could do things she hadn\u2019t tried before. Now it\u2019s more about pushing that as far as we can.\u201d The afternoon is going to be taken up with shooting a flashback featuring Maureen and Lewis, who is played by the Norwegian actor Anders Danielsen Lie. There has been no news from Stewart\u2019s agent, so I decide to call Peter Sattler, the writer-director of Camp X-Ray, to get some idea of why she is so elusive. \u201cKristen likes to live in the moment on set and to preserve that lightning-in-a-bottle feeling of a scene,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe responds to what\u2019s happening right there, so it never sounds like she\u2019s just reading lines. I would stop a scene when she wasn\u2019t expecting it, to get her flustered. Or I\u2019d purposefully criticise a take to rile her up. She\u2019d be like, \u2018Are you fucking with me?\u2019 She was boots-in all the way. I said to her, \u2018We\u2019re making a tiny, tiny movie and you\u2019re one of the biggest stars on the planet. Are you gonna be a diva?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, I\u2019m down with it. I\u2019m there.\u2019 And she was. People would come to the set and go, \u2018Where\u2019s Kristen?\u2019 She\u2019d just be there, in costume, hanging out with the crew. This is the face of Chanel for Chrissakes!\u201d     Stewart with Robert Pattinson in Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1    The shoot has moved to the cottage interior and there is nowhere for me to stand without getting in everyone\u2019s way. I can spend another hour or two staring at a monitor. Or I can watch the back of Stewart\u2019s head through a crack in the garden fence. It\u2019s getting dark. I trudge through the mud to the cabin where the production office is based. I nudge the door open and ask Barthet if I can get a car to the airport now. She looks a little surprised, but nips out to see if there is a driver available to take me. I sit down at the desk of one of her colleagues. I spot a note attached to an A3 envelope. It reads: \u201cDear Kristen, I would like to kindly ask you if you could sign these photographs.\u201d I suddenly feel very depressed. This is a small, prestigious European production directed by a highly-prized auteur and destined for the competition at Cannes. It couldn\u2019t be much further from Twilight. And yet everyone is still clamouring for a piece of Kristen Stewart. I include myself in this, along with the unnamed person chasing her autograph. Still, it would be wrong to say that I\u2019ve had a wasted journey. When my driver picked me up from the airport the night before, he gave me a Personal Shopper goodie bag, which contained a half-bottle of white wine. I couldn\u2019t find a corkscrew in my hotel room so I tried using a pencil. All this did was break the pencil and reduce the cork to crumbs. So I called reception to ask for a corkscrew. After the room service guy opened the bottle, I tipped him a 200 Czech koruna note, which is just over \u00a35, because I didn\u2019t have any coins. So essentially I destroyed a pencil and purchased a small bottle of wine. When it came to Kristen Stewart, however, I never graduated beyond the status of window shopper. \u2022 Personal Shopper is in competition at the Cannes film festival, 11-22 May.",
