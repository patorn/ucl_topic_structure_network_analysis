With Ariel, Plath\u2019s second volume of poems, we approach the catalyst for 20th-century poetry\u2019s thermonuclear explosion. First, the terrible circumstances surrounding the first appearance of Ariel are essential to any reading of Plath\u2019s work. In the early years of her marriage to Ted Hughes, Plath had been the junior partner. She was known as the author of The Colossus: and Other Poems (1960), a well-received first collection, described by the Guardian as an \u201coutstanding technical accomplishment\u201d, but not yet indicating the extraordinary power locked within Plath\u2019s literary psyche. The key to Plath\u2019s final years, on top of the disintegration of her marriage to Hughes, lies in her lifelong fascination with her own death. As she expresses it in Ariel, her title poem, \u201cI am the arrow\u2026 that flies. Suicidal, at one with the drive. Into the red eye...\u201d Everything she wrote now was shadowed by this obsession. Between 1961 and \u201962, working fast and urgently, she completed her autobiographical novel, The Bell Jar, writing to her mother that what she had done \u201cis to throw together events from my own life, fictionalising to add colour \u2013 I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown\u2026 I\u2019ve tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar.\u201d The Bell Jar was released by William Heinemann (publisher of The Colossus) in London on 14 January 1963 under the pseudonym Victoria Lucas. This was a decision inspired by Plath\u2019s desire to spare the feelings of her mother and a number of real-life characters in the novel. Plath\u2019s first novel appeared in the midst of the most bitter English winter of the century, and aroused virtually no comment. Meanwhile, Plath had begun to put together the manuscript that became the framework for Ariel in early 1962. Restlessly focusing her poetic intention, she had changed its title from The Rival to A Birthday Present to Daddy to The Rabbit Catcher and finally to Ariel and Other Poems. She was now separated from Ted Hughes, whose affair with Assia Wevill had precipitated their break-up, and living alone with her two small children, Nick and Frieda, near Primrose Hill, London, in a house, 23 Fitzroy Road, once occupied by W\u200aB Yeats. By November 1962, she was done.     Plath and Hughes on their honeymoon in Paris.

All the poems written during the autumn of 1962, and into the new year, had been inspired by the intense solitude of her situation, and many of the final poems in Ariel are attributable to her predicament as a young single mother, but also to her clinical depression and the incipient breakdown that culminated in her suicide in the early morning of 11 February 1963. (Al Alvarez\u2019s account of this tragedy in his study of suicide, The Savage God, remains the indispensable portrait of this psychodrama.) The poignant circumstances of Plath\u2019s death, as they became known, intensified the Anglo-American literary interest in the poet and her work. In 1965, The Bell Jar was republished under her own name and quickly recognised as a dark classic of contemporary feminism. But it was the publication of Ariel in the same year (1966 in the US) that set the seal on her posthumous fame and reputation. Here was a collection of strange, disturbing, and confessional poems whose wild and exhilarating ferocity exerted a remarkable grip on the imagination of a new generation. Robert Lowell, in his preface to the first edition of Ariel, describes these as poems that are \u201cplaying Russian roulette with six cartridges in the cylinder\u201d. He was acknowledging what countless subsequent readers would discover for themselves: that Ariel is the volume on which Plath\u2019s reputation as one of the most original, daring and gifted poets of the last century rests. The manuscript Plath had left behind on her death was titled Ariel and Other Poems. But that manuscript would not appear for more than 40 years. Instead, a rather different book called simply Ariel (published by Faber & Faber) reached bookshops in the UK in 1965 and sold a phenomenal 15,000 copies in 10 months. In the US edition (varying slightly from the UK edition), 12 of Plath\u2019s chosen poems were cut, 15 new ones added in their place; and several other poems moved from their original order. Ted Hughes \u2013 of whom, towards the end of her life, she had written \u201cI hate and despise him so I can hardly speak\u201d \u2013 had made the changes, inviting many searching and explosive questions about his apparent conflict of interest as Plath\u2019s executor and also the subject of her poetry. A generation would pass before an enraged feminist critique softened into a belated recognition that Hughes had fulfilled an almost impossible task with remarkable sensitivity and understanding. After all, the manuscript left behind at her death was still a work in progress.     Plath\u2019s novel The Bell Jar was originally published under a pseudonym.    Among these groundbreaking, and often difficult, poems are numbered several classics: Lady Lazarus, Ariel, The Moon and the Yew Tree, Daddy and Stings. Plath\u2019s fierce interrogation of herself and her feelings, and her unflinching honesty, came as a shocking revelation to poetry readers in the mid-1960s. Eventually, the Ariel of 1965, edited by Ted Hughes, was complemented in 2004 by a new edition, masterminded by Frieda Hughes, Plath\u2019s faithful daughter, which for the first time restored the selection and arrangement of the poems as her mother had left them. In addition, finally, there is Ted Hughes\u2019s own response (in Birthday Letters) to his dead wife\u2019s phoenix-like resurgence. One of the most disturbing poems here is Suttee, his record of Plath\u2019s emergence as a poet, in which Hughes casts himself as a midwife delivering an \u201cexplosion / Of screams\u201d and before being \u201cengulfed / In a flood, a dam-burst thunder / Of a new myth\u201d, a birth that \u201csucked the oxygen out of both of us\u201d. Many of the poems in Birthday Letters address the conundrum of Plath\u2019s other self. Hughes had already rehearsed this line of thought in his 1982 foreword to the first edition of Plath\u2019s journals, claiming that, although he had \u201cspent every day with her for six years, and was rarely separated from her for more than two or three hours at a time\u201d, he had never seen \u201cher show her real self to anybody \u2013 except, perhaps, in the last three months of her life\u201d. Despite the unreconciled dialogue between husband and wife, in many conflicting registers, Ariel survives the obsessive extra-literary attention directed towards Plath and Hughes in the more than 50 years since Plath\u2019s suicide. For many readers, it is likely to remain one of the great volumes in the Anglo-American canon.
