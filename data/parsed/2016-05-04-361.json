In a speech published in Beijing\u2019s official newspaper this week, the Chinese president warned that the presence of \u201ccabals and cliques\u201d inside the party risked \u201ccompromising the political security of the party and the country\u201d.   Related: Chinese corruption gets House of Cards treatment with Communist mini-series    \u201cThere are careerists and conspirators existing in our party and undermining the party\u2019s governance,\u201d Xi said, according to the People\u2019s Daily transcript of his comments. \u201cWe should not bury our heads in the sand and spare these members but must make a resolute response to eliminate the problem and deter further violations.\u201d The speech comes at a time of growing speculation over possible factional struggles within the 88 million-member Communist party that Xi has led since late 2012. As evidence of those rifts, experts point to recent moves by Xi to rein in the influential Communist Youth League, which is the power base of former president Hu Jintao and current prime minister Li Keqiang. This week it emerged that the Youth League\u2019s budget had been slashed by more than 50% following a damning investigation into its activities by Xi\u2019s anti-corruption agents. Experts also see Xi\u2019s decision last month to take on the title of commander-in-chief of China\u2019s joint battle command centre as a potential indicator of trouble at the top. Since coming to power Xi has amassed an unusual plethora of official titles including general secretary of the Communist party, president of the People\u2019s Republic of China, chairman of the central military commission, leader of the national security commission and head of the leading group for overall reform. One academic has dubbed him the \u201cchairman of everything\u201d. Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard University expert in elite Communist party politics, said: \u201cXi Jinping\u2019s donning of uniform and giving him his new military title is a warning to his colleagues that he has the army behind him. Whether he actually has or not, one doesn\u2019t know. But that is his bulwark, as it was Mao\u2019s.\u201d  However, MacFarquhar said the new title could be a sign of weakness rather than strength, noting that not even Mao Zedong had accumulated such a glut of titles. \u201cChairman Mao never needed titles. Everyone knew who was in charge,\u201d he said. Xi has made a high-profile anti-corruption campaign one of his administration\u2019s key missions, disciplining hundreds of thousands of officials, including top party and military figures. But experts say the war on corruption has generated discontent among officials, caused political paralysis and fuelled suspicions Xi is using the campaign as a pretext to purge his political enemies. In his recent speech, Xi denied those charges and vowed to \u201cstep up\u201d the anti-corruption drive, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news and propaganda agency. \u201cWe must make it clear that our party\u2019s fight against corruption is not a snobbish affair that discriminates between different people, and it is not a House of Cards power struggle,\u201d Xi said. Andrew Wedeman, a political scientist who is writing a book called Swatting Flies and Hunting Tigers: Xi Jinping\u2019s War on Corruption, said continuing to pursue the campaign carried severe risks for China\u2019s leader. \u201cThere is a certain point where the elite would want to wind this down because at the end of the day \u2013 as perhaps suggested by the revelations in the Panama Papers \u2013 there is enough guilt to go around among the leadership that if you really push this thing too far then an awful lot of people would be in trouble. \u201cGiven the extent of corruption, you can only push this thing so far without doing serious damage to the integrity and the unity of the party,\u201d Wedeman added.",
