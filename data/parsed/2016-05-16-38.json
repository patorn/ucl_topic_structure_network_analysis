  "body": "The original plaintiff in the landmark class-action lawsuit seeking to reclassify Uber drivers as employees has spoken out against the settlement and accused the drivers\u2019 attorney of obtaining his support for the agreement \u201cunder false pretenses, duress, and misinformation\u201d. Douglas O\u2019Connor, a former Uber driver, filed suit against the ride-hail company in August 2013, kicking off a three-year legal battle that resulted in a proposed settlement of $84m on 21 April. It allowed Uber to continue classifying drivers as independent contractors. \u201cIt is apparent that under the agreement, Uber drivers are being sold out and shortchanged by billions of dollars while sacrificing the determination of their classification as employees,\u201d reads a declaration filed by O\u2019Connor\u2019s new attorneys on Monday morning. \u201cI cannot in good conscience support this disastrous settlement agreement.\u201d    Related: Uber\u2019s $100m driver payout could have been $852m, angering some drivers    O\u2019Connor\u2019s objections join a chorus of dissatisfaction against the drivers\u2019 attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, over the deal\u2019s $84m monetary payout \u2013 which could rise to $100m if Uber\u2019s valuation increases to $93.75bn within a year of its initial public offering (IPO). Court filings released on 9 May revealed that, had the case gone to trial and Uber lost, the company could have been forced to pay as much as $852m to drivers in reimbursements for losses over mileage, tips and mobile phone charges. As he was the original plaintiff, the case became known as O\u2019Connor v Uber. But though O\u2019Connor\u2019s name may add a certain resonance to his dissent, it\u2019s not clear that his objection carries any more legal weight than any other of the more than 300,000 drivers in the class.  \u201cMr O\u2019Connor was not certified as a lead plaintiff but we kept him in the loop on the case and included him in the settlement,\u201d said Liss-Riordan by email in response to O\u2019Connor\u2019s declaration. As of 1 September 2015, O\u2019Connor was \u201cno longer seeking to serve as a class representative\u201d, according to court filings. But O\u2019Connor\u2019s new attorney, Ben Meiselas of Geragos & Geragos said: \u201cIf you look at the complaint, he was the putative class representative. He did the depositions. He had to sit through it. He is the one who was the face of the litigation.\u201d Class representatives bear special responsibility, and privileges, in class-action cases.  \u201cThe class representatives are the voice of the class, and the class attorney has a legal obligation to include the class representatives in settlement discussions,\u201d said Beth A Ross, a labor and employment attorney who has brought class-action lawsuits over the employment classification of FedEx drivers. \u201cIt is not common in a class case for the certified class representative to object to a class settlement, although it occasionally happens.\u201d    Related: Uber and Lyft pull out of Austin after locals vote against self-regulation    In his declaration, O\u2019Connor alleges that Liss-Riordan did not invite him to attend any mediation sessions with Uber or consult with him on the settlement. He also alleges that he was only provided with a copy of the settlement after it had already been announced to the press, and that he was pressured to sign the settlement before he had a chance to read it. \u201cI am limited in what I can say about a former client but this is simply not true,\u201d Liss-Riordan responded.  Geragos & Geragos, a Los Angeles-based law firm that, last Wednesday joined a motion seeking to remove Liss-Riordan as class counsel for the case.  That filing described the settlement as \u201ccollusive and disastrous\u201d and \u201ctantamount to a $1bn wage theft\u201d.    O\u2019Connor\u2019s objection to the settlement is a marked change from remarks he made to the Guardian the morning after it was reached, on 22 April. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d the former Uber driver and current corporate chauffeur said at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve moved on to greener pastures.\u201d",
