  "body": "Brendan Rodgers will be unveiled as Celtic\u2019s manager on Monday afternoon, after the Scottish champions confirmed the Northern Irishman would replace Ronny Deila on a 12-month rolling contract. Dermot Desmond, Celtic\u2019s main shareholder, met the candidates \u2013 also including Neil Lennon and David Moyes \u2013 in London at the start of this week. Rodgers, who has been out of work since being sacked by Liverpool last October, was initially thought to be eyeing a job abroad. Yet in what will be viewed as a coup for Celtic, he has accepted the challenge of trying to lead the club back into the group stages of the Champions League. \u201cI am absolutely delighted to be named Celtic manager,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThis is genuinely a huge honour for me. I have followed Celtic all my life and to be given this fantastic opportunity and to be part of such a truly great football club is a dream come true. \u201cI will give my new role everything I have and do all I can to bring our supporters exciting, entertaining and winning football. \u201cThe club has been in magnificent shape in recent years and has collected silverware regularly during this time. My objective now, of course, is to continue this work, to keep us at the top and again make our mark in Europe. \u201cI know what a magnificent support Celtic enjoys and I can promise our fans one thing \u2013 that I will be doing everything I can to give you a team that you can be proud of and a team that delivers.\u201d Deila won back-to-back titles after taking office in June 2014. Yet his tenure was defined by a series of failures in Europe. Three days after last month\u2019s Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Rangers, it was announced that the Norwegian would leave Celtic. Peter Lawwell, Celtic\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cBrendan is a highly sought after manager and we are pleased that we have been able to bring such a high calibre individual to Celtic. \u201cHe has a huge and genuine affection for the club. I know Brendan feels privileged to be named Celtic manager and I know he will give us everything he has to be successful at Celtic. Above all, he will bring huge experience, knowledge and ability to the role. \u201cWe wanted to bring one of the biggest and best names to the club to match our own aspirations and those of our supporters \u2013 we believe, in appointing Brendan, that we have done this. We have appointed a special manager and we are sure he can bring some special times to Celtic.\u201d   Related: Celtic confirm under-fire manager Ronny Deila will leave at end of season",
