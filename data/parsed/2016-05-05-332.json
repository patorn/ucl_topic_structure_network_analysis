  "body": "It might not be quite as all-encompassing as last year\u2019s General Election, but elections are taking place across the UK on the 5 May. 129 MSPs will be elected to the Scottish Parliament, alongside 108 and 60 representatives for the Northern Ireland and Welsh assemblies respectively.  London decides its new mayor, as well as London assembly members, after a sometimes controversial campaign. There are also local council and police and crime commissioner elections across England (and Wales, for the latter). There are also two Westminster by-elections. This is the place to share your stories from wherever you are on polling day in words, pictures or video. Show us what\u2019s been happening in your community and at polling stations around the country. If you\u2019re following the election from outside of the UK, tell us how and why. What are the most important issues in these elections where you are? What needs to change in your area, and do you think anything will change as a result of them? Whether it\u2019s your first time voting or you\u2019re a veteran of the ballot box, we want to hear about your day. Remember that sharing pictures of yourself or what\u2019s happening before you go into or after you leave the polling station are great, but please don\u2019t take pictures or video of yourself inside the polling station, as publishing it to GuardianWitness or social media could be a breach of the law. You can share your stories by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button on this article. You can also use the GuardianWitness smartphone app or the Guardian app or email us at guardian.witness@theguardian.com  GuardianWitness is the home of readers\u2019 content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others.",
