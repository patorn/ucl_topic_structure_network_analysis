  "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said there is no point complaining about Liverpool\u2019s meagre ticket allocation for the Europa League final and that ticketless fans should head for Basel on 18 May.   Related: Liverpool fans allocated just over 10,000 tickets for Europa League final    Liverpool and Sevilla will each receive only 10,236 tickets for the final at St Jakob-Park, having qualified with victories over Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk respectively on Thursday. Basel\u2019s stadium will have a capacity of 35,000 for the Europa League final and only one Uefa final since 1998 has been staged at a smaller venue \u2013 the 2014 Europa League final in Turin. Around 2,000 of Liverpool\u2019s tickets will go to former shareholders who sold to Tom Hicks and George Gillett in 2007. As a condition of the sale to the club\u2019s previous owners, the shareholders\u2019 priority rights for cup final tickets was protected and the current owners, Fenway Sports Group, are unable to change the terms. Seasonal hospitality members are also guaranteed seats. Only 47% of Liverpool\u2019s tickets \u2013 just under 5,000 \u2013 fall into what the club described as the \u201cgeneral supporter allocation\u201d. Liverpool have 27,000 season ticket holders and took 32,000 fans to the Capital One Cup final in February. Uefa has said Basel was selected two years ago as it was Switzerland\u2019s turn to host the event and St Jakob-Park is the biggest football stadium in the country. European football\u2019s governing body has also indicated that Liverpool\u2019s ticket allocation will be increased in the event of Sevilla not taking up their full entitlement. Unai Emery\u2019s team play the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona a week after the Europa League final. Contrary to Uefa\u2019s customary advice, Klopp believes supporters without tickets should travel to Switzerland and insisted it was futile protesting against an allocation that was decided long ago. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cWhat I learned in life is what I can\u2019t change I don\u2019t think about. It\u2019s a wonderful opportunity and we can\u2019t change the stadium. It\u2019s a wonderful stadium and wonderful city. It\u2019s worth going even if you don\u2019t have a ticket, to enjoy the city. We can\u2019t think about the size of the stadium. If you ask who wants to see this final you will find 30 million people so there is no chance. It\u2019s like this.\u201d However, Uefa has since advised Liverpool supporters who travel without a ticket to stay away from the stadium. \u201cWe advise anyone without tickets not to approach the stadium on the day of the final since safety and security measures will be very tight,\u201d said a statement. \u201cThe stadium perimeter will be reinforced in order to guarantee safe and secure entrance for all ticket holders.\u201d Of Liverpool\u2019s allocation 10% will go to matchday officials, players, former players and media, and 2% to contractual partners. Meanwhile, Klopp said Liverpool\u2019s captain, Jordan Henderson, and the striker Divock Origi may have a chance of featuring against Sevilla despite fearing their seasons were over because of respective knee and ankle ligament injuries.   Related: The Joy of Six: football chants    He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know about Jordan in this moment but he was really celebrating after the game and I saw in his eyes that he thinks he has a chance. It is the same with Divock Origi. You need to be ready the Sunday before otherwise we can\u2019t take the risk. No doubt he will be fit for the European Championship.\u201d Klopp also believes Daniel Sturridge, who impressed on his return to the Europa League starting lineup on Thursday, will be in peak condition for England this summer. \u201cWith Daniel we did everything we could to get him as fit as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cNow he looks great and that\u2019s good news for England with the European Championship. There is nothing negative.\u201d Adam Lallana has said the misery of losing the Capital One Cup final in February will spur Liverpool to ensure there is no repeat against Sevilla. Liverpool have reached two cup finals since Klopp replaced Brendan Rodgers as manager in October, the first ending in a penalty shootout defeat against Manchester City at Wembley. The England international, outstanding in the 3-0 win over Villarreal, insists that painful experience can help Klopp\u2019s team in their second shot at a trophy this season. Lallana said: \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced losing in a final and it is not nice. I think the experience of that day will help us, even in such a short turnaround to this final. It is a young squad but I feel we need to win something to feel what it is like to win and almost make it like a bug, just keep going.\u201d",
