  "body": "British fighter jets were scrambled to intercept three Russian aircraft approaching the Baltic skies in the first such intervention as part of their latest mission to keep airspace there secure, the defence ministry has said.   Related: RAF jets intercept two Russian bombers nearing UK airspace    The RAF Typhoons were launched from Amari air base in Estonia on Thursday afternoon when the Russian military transport aircraft did not transmit a recognised identification code and appeared to be unresponsive. Britain\u2019s defence secretary, Michael Fallon, described it as an \u201cact of Russian aggression\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is another example of just how important the UK\u2019s contribution to the Baltic Air Policing Mission is. We were able to instantly respond to this act of Russian aggression \u2013 a demonstration of our commitment to Nato\u2019s collective defence.\u201d In February, Typhoons from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire intercepted two Russian long-range bombers that were heading towards UK airspace. Four RAF jets were deployed in April to join the Baltic Air Policing mission \u2013 in which Nato members help others who do not have their own capabilities. They will remain attached to the mission until the end of August. One of the pilots involved in the mission on Thursday said it went smoothly. \u201cThe scramble went exactly as planned, we launched our Typhoon aircraft quickly and then using our advanced sensors and mission systems, combined with support from our battlespace managers on the ground, carried out textbook intercepts of the three aircraft.\u201d Wing Commander Gordon Melville said: \u201cWe have once more proven our ability to secure the skies in the vicinity of the Baltic States and have demonstrated the close link between the Royal Air Force, Estonian and Nato units that have planned and enabled this defensive response so successfully. We will continue to stand by 24/7 to secure the Baltic skies.\u201d During the last Baltic mission Typhoon fighter jets were scrambled 17 times, intercepting more than 40 Russian aircraft.
