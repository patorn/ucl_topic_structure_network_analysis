  "body": "Less than a year after his election as leader reignited the hopes of separatists in Quebec, media tycoon Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau has stepped down as the head of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. P\u00e9ladeau said he had been forced to decide between his work and his family. \u201cI am forced to make a choice, an agonizing choice, between my family and my political project, our political project, which is shared by so many people,\u201d he told reporters in Montreal on Monday as he fought back tears. \u201cI have chosen my family.\u201d  Earlier this year, P\u00e9ladeau, 54, split from his wife, television producer Julie Snyder. On Sunday, Snyder told a television talkshow program that the couple \u2013 who have three children among them \u2013 are in mediation.  P\u00e9ladeau said the party would soon begin the search for an interim leader. \u201cI\u2019m making this decision for the good of my children,\u201d he added. \u201cI have to remain an example for them. I profoundly love the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, its activists and its (National Assembly) members.\u201d   Related: Citizen P\u00e9ladeau: flamboyant tycoon ready to revitalize Quebec's separatists    The former CEO of Quebecor, Canada\u2019s second biggest media group, P\u00e9ladeau burst onto the Canadian political scene in 2014, vowing to \u201cmake Quebec a country\u201d. He was elected as the PQ leader last May and since struggled to woo voters from the province\u2019s governing Liberal party.  Heir to a media empire founded by his father, P\u00e9ladeau\u2019s election as leader earned him comparisons with Italian media magnate-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi and injected a star quality into Quebec\u2019s separatist movement, amid concerns over dwindling membership numbers. In 1980, the party had 300,000 members; last year the figure had slipped to around 70,000. Recent polls suggest that most Quebeckers oppose sovereignty.  Many within the party\u2019s left, however, found it hard to reconcile P\u00e9ladeau\u2019s call for an independent Quebec with his abysmal record on labour rights. His time at the helm of Quebecor was marked by conflict with labour unions, including 16 lockouts during strikes at Quebecor companies. Others questioned how P\u00e9ladeau would manage the glaring conflict of interest between his political power and Quebecor, which ranks as the main private media owner in Quebec. P\u00e9ladeau\u2019s solution was to put his shares in a trust.  On Monday, P\u00e9ladeau promised to remain active within the party. \u201cI am convinced that the future of Quebec and Quebecers lies in the independence of our nation,\u201d he said.",
