  "body": "Only five players remain from the Hull City squad who won automatic promotion in 2013 and it provides an insight into the strength of this season\u2019s Championship that one of them, David Meyler, harbours no doubt the current crop are more talented. Yet that apparent superior ability was only enough for Steve Bruce\u2019s team to finish fourth, 10 points off Burnley and six adrift of Middlesbrough. Plagued by inconsistency, especially away from home, Hull\u2019s season mixed 3-0 wins over both promoted teams with defeats by three of the bottom four. So here they are, running the play-off gauntlet with Derby in their sights and the first leg at the iPro Stadium on Saturday. The clubs\u2019 meetings this season do not make for pretty reading for Hull: two defeats, six goals conceded and none scored. Derby were the only team to win in the league on Humberside \u2013 Hull\u2019s other 10 defeats came on the road \u2013 but Meyler believes confidence, belief and hunger remain high. \u201cWe still have a great chance,\u201d the midfielder says. \u201cDerby will be tough but we believe in ourselves. At the start the target was automatic promotion. We felt with the squad we had we could win the Championship but we hit bad form and sticky patches at the wrong times.

We came out of that and got back to winning ways but then had another sticky patch. It was unfortunate but that\u2019s why the division is so difficult and tough for teams to go straight back up.\u201d The lure of winning promotion at Wembley remains great. For Meyler at least, the complicated route would be more satisfying. \u201cWe have two games that are huge and a chance to reach Wembley \u2013 if you guaranteed me which way to go up, I would say the play-offs. We\u2019re doing it the hard way but I believe we can and nobody can tell us otherwise.\u201d   Related: Previewing the Football League play-offs: how the 12 clubs have fared in the past    On a personal level, the 26-year-old\u2019s season has mirrored the club\u2019s. His highlight was a morning in January when his girlfriend gave birth to their daughter, Alanna, and hours later, having not slept all night, he was at the training ground to sign a new two-year contract. \u201cI have watched him grow from a boy to a father,\u201d Bruce, who also worked with Meyler at Sunderland, has said. \u201cWe all know that he\u2019s a manager\u2019s dream.\u201d There have been noteworthy issues for the vice-captain, too. He was demoted to the bench for several weeks following a mistake in the FA Cup replay against Arsenal in March and Bruce remarked last month that \u201cwhen his partner had the baby I think he lost a stone in weight. He was up every other hour feeding the baby because that\u2019s just him\u201d. Meyler worked his way back into the starting XI, only for a hamstring problem to keep him out of the final three league games. He says he is fit and ready for Derby after sitting out last weekend\u2019s hammering of Rotherham \u201cas a precaution\u201d because there was nothing riding on the game. Bruce\u2019s team are almost unrecognisable from the team who went up in dramatic circumstances on the final day three years ago, when Ross McCormack scored a last-minute goal for Leeds to bump Watford out of second and into the play-offs, ensuring Hull went up in their stead. Meyler thinks this side are stronger, making their fourth-place finish all the more frustrating. \u201cIn the team we had in 2013, we probably had a lot of players that were hungry to reach the Premier League,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this team has players that have already been there. This team is 100% more talented, more gifted. It\u2019s just consistency that we have lacked. We\u2019re disappointed in ourselves for that. We\u2019d beaten Burnley and Middlesbrough at home 3-0, we\u2019ve had fantastic wins but at times we left ourselves down with inconsistency.\u201d     Hull City\u2019s David Meyler reacts to Olivier Giroud\u2019s opening goal for Arsenal in their FA Cup fifth round replay at the KC Stadium. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters    Without taking anything for granted, Meyler will likely be part of the Republic of Ireland\u2019s European Championship squad. He would rather miss the friendly against Holland though, 24 hours before the play-off final on 28 May. He was named in Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s extended group for that fixture \u2013 along with six others involved in the play-offs \u2013 but hopes there will be double reason to celebrate on Saturday afternoon because O\u2019Neill is expected to name his 23-man squad for the tournament. The prospect of being involved in Euro 2016 has added to Meyler\u2019s motivation but forgetting about France has been challenging. \u201cYou have to keep it to one side,\u201d he says. \u201cThe lads who played in the Bosnia play-offs know they are in but for the rest it\u2019s about playing at a consistently high level for our clubs and achieving something to make the manager take notice. The majority are playing all the time and it\u2019s a case of if you\u2019re doing well with your club you will reap the international awards. \u201cWhat you do at club level gets you that recognition. I\u2019m obviously looking forward to it because it\u2019s huge for the country. It also helps to focus on your club game because doing well there does not harm your chances.\u201d",
