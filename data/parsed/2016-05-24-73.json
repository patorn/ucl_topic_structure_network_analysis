  "body": "Jamie Bourn, business development manager for Purpose Media UK Limited, explains why he should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:  I am the business development manager for Purpose Media, an award winning creative design and digital marketing agency that has grown an average of 30% each year since it was founded in 2009, and more than 66% in the last year alone.  I started as an apprentice in 2010, aged 16, winning over the managing director by explaining the benefits of apprentices and highlighting a grant I\u2019d found to to fund his first year\u2019s salary. I completed my IT diploma early and won Apprentice of The Year in 2012.  I now head up the sales department, and am solely responsible for winning \u00a31m in new business in 2015, as well as adding \u00a3250,000 in recurring revenue by upselling existing customers.  I have also implemented a defined sales process and run regular internal team training sessions. The newly introduced CRM system now enables opportunities to be tracked and turned into customers.  I will always go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction, colleague development and take regular exams to become Google and HubSpot certified. I am the the pioneer of many new ideas including a breakfast event with Google, which is planned for later in 2016. I am still only 21 but sit in on the company board and operations meetings and play a key role in strategic planning. Our plans are for Purpose Media to reach \u00a310m within five years.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
