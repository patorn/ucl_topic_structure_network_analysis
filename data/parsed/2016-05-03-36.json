  "body": "Like every candidate who isn\u2019t Zac Goldsmith or Sadiq Khan, the Green Party\u2019s Sian Berry has felt squeezed out of the limelight of the London mayor campaign. This, though, has had its consolations. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit frustrated by the focus on the two-horse race,\u201d she says. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t inevitable at the start.\u201d And yet: \u201cIt\u2019s also been nice not to have been in it, and all the negativity that\u2019s been going on. The nature of it has upset me.\u201d  With commendable consistency, given her party\u2019s strong stance on civil liberties, Berry has intervened in the frontrunners\u2019 hostilities. She has several times times condemned Goldsmith\u2019s (often backfiring) attempts to tarnish Khan as an apologist for, or even an enabler of, Islamist extremism on the grounds that in the past he has \u201cshared platforms\u201d - that helpfully nebulous concept - with people reported to have expressed unpleasant views.  Media complicity in this denigration of Khan, which has drawn sharp criticism from some of Goldsmith\u2019s fellow Conservatives, has displeased her too. \u201cAll they\u2019ve kept reporting, in the Evening Standard, in the Telegraph and the Times, over and over again, is basically the same attack on Sadiq: he went to a meeting that was about human rights in some respect, or he spoke as a local MP, and they\u2019re throwing it at him as if it\u2019s some terrible working-with-extremists kind of thing, when at 90% of those meetings there were other MPs from other parties. I\u2019ve been quite consistent in condemning it. I feel it\u2019s my duty as one of the other candidates. It\u2019s really not what London needs.\u201d  London also hasn\u2019t needed to be so heavily distracted from the policy offers of the Greens. Adventurous ideas for introducing a zone-less \u201cflat fares\u201d programme for public transport and redeveloping City airport as a housing and business innovation quarter have been joined more recently by a bunch of ideas for bringing air quality within legal limits and a proposal for founding a regional public bank to help small businesses. This is modelled on existing schemes in Switzerland, Spain, various places in the US and, in particular, Germany. \u201cIt would also be an ethical place to put your savings,\u201d Berry says. \u201cAnd it would involve much more personal contact with customers.\u201d  The thinking behind the bank fits with a Green theme of community involvement running through other signature policies. Mindful of the resistance to some of Boris Johnson\u2019s cycling infrastructure, she cites the approach taken in New York by now former mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s transport commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan (no relation). Basically, she tried stuff out before setting it in stone.  \u201cThat\u2019s the process I want to use, more or less,\u201d Berry says. \u201cIt\u2019s to say to communities, \u2018do you want to make your town centre people-friendly? If you do, come to us and we\u2019ll help you put together a plan.\u2019 I think doing things on a temporary basis is a good method. The message from the Mini-Hollands is that coming forward with multi-million pound schemes that are too big to fail, and pushing them through so as not to waste the money can potentially just rile people.\u201d She\u2019d make \u201cliveable\u201d streets in their broadest sense an inclusive process from the bottom up: \u201cIf it\u2019s a cycling project and you rely on people who are already cyclists to be your ambassadors, you might rub people up the wrong way. It\u2019s not for the people who already cycle, it\u2019s for people who would like to cycle and don\u2019t. Or who want to walk more and don\u2019t want to have to scurry across a busy road. We have to make sure that the next phase comes from communities who want to reduce the impact of traffic generally.\u201d The same principle guides the Greens\u2019 distinctive housing policies. Their Renters\u2019 Union would be funded from and supported by City Hall, but grow out of campaigns at local level. Berry has championed \u201cmaking creative use of empty buildings,\u201d rather than letting them rot. The Greens are also strongly against the demolition of housing estates, arguing that improvements and additional homes can be provided more efficiently and with far fewer damaging effects if residents are empowered to lead regenerations themselves: \u201cDensification in certain areas is going to have to happen, but it has to be done with communities.\u201d She proposes a community homes unit to equip them with the skills they need. Preventing demolitions was one of the four \u201cred line\u201d tests the party set for deciding whether to recommend a \u201csecond preference\u201d vote for Khan, Goldsmith or neither. In the event, both frontrunners missed out. They were invited to formally discuss the policy issues - airport expansion, road-building and inequality were the other three - but both failed to. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of stick for not recommending, but we were literally left with no choice,\u201d Berry says. On estates, she felt both men had said good things but she and her colleagues had needed to know more about how they would enable residents to \u201cown the process\u201d of change, should it occur. She accepts that Khan\u2019s likely housing adviser, Islington\u2019s cabinet member for housing James Murray, is probably the most anti-demolition politician in such a position in the city. She also makes a favourable distinction between the approaches of Hackney and Camden, where she is a councillor, and those of Labour counterparts Southwark and Lambeth, where some of the most fraught estate regeneration battles continue to be fought.  \u201cI\u2019ve been pushing Sadiq on this because I think he might be up for condemning or challenging some of the Labour councils. I think it will be a test if he does become mayor. Camden aren\u2019t brilliant, but they and Hackney are trying things out. They\u2019re not as bad.\u201d She thinks Khan\u2019s pledge to review the Silvertown tunnel and other possible Thames crossings east of Tower Bridge might have resulted from Green pressure, though she\u2019s surprised he wasn\u2019t attracted by their equality red line: \u201cThat was just an open goal for Sadiq.\u201d Perhaps the reason for Khan\u2019s reticence lies in the diplomacy of relationships with Labour boroughs: I\u2019m told by an independent source that discussions about his policy on estates became \u201cquite frosty\u201d at times. As Berry says, how he handles the issue should he become mayor will be interesting. A more immediate question now for her is whether her party can maintain its two-member presence on the London Assembly, where the outgoing Jenny Jones - who finished third in the mayoral race in 2012 - and Darren Johnson have done a lot to embed Green politics in mainstream debate about how London should be run.  When we met, Berry was confident that momentum was gathering. Since then, the Clean Air in London campaign has put the Greens top of its list for air pollution policies (followed closely by the Lib Dems) and recommended a second preference vote for Khan (placing him comfortably ahead of Goldsmith). Londoners on Bikes have reached the same conclusion regarding cycling policies. Even so, the latest opinion poll again shows Berry in a low-scoring bunch in the mayoral contest with Lib Dem Caroline Pidgeon and Ukip\u2019s Peter Whittle.  Like them, her victory hopes lie with the \u201cLondonwide list\u201d section of the Assembly election, which uses a form of proportional representation to ensure that smaller parties get a look in. Berry tops the Green list, followed by Islington councillor Caroline Russell. Anything less than two seats will be a disappointment. The same will go for the Lib Dems while Ukip have high hopes of taking one seat at least. It could be nip and tuck. Sian Berry\u2019s Green Party manifesto is here.
