  "body": "Precise, understated, simple, complicated: the work of Felix Gonzalez-Torres requires slow looking. Three concurrent exhibitions, in New York, Milan and London, each curated by artists Julie Ault and Roni Horn, are presenting Gonzalez-Torres\u2019s work. Rather than adding up to a dispersed retrospective (he has had several), each exhibition focuses on a different aspect of his art. The New York show consists of some of his fragmentary textual \u201cportraits\u201d (including one of Ault); his bead-curtain works hang in Milan; and in London, Ault and Horn display a number of works from a single year of his life. The London exhibition fills one large gallery, split by a dividing wall. In the narrower space near the entrance hangs a mirror, showing the street beyond. The blue surface gives the world it reflects (and swallows) a kind of hard, filmic chill, draining things of their warmth. Gonzalez-Torres was obsessed with the magic hour of the LA sunset and its golden light, but \u201cUntitled\u201d (Fear) is a crepuscular last light. As much as the mirror reflects, it projects an atmosphere.     \u201cUntitled\u201d (Last Letter). Photograph: The Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation Courtesy of Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York    Why the fear? You could almost call this exhibition 1991 \u2013 Gonzalez-Torres made all these works the year his lover Ross Laycock died, on 24 January, from Aids-related complications. In the largest space, images line two opposite walls. In one we see Ross and his dog, Harry, straining on his leash. Taken some years previously, the photograph, like all the others here, has been mounted on stiff card and turned into a jigsaw. At first, the variety of images makes little sense: re-photographed newspaper clippings and half-tone photos, enlarged fragments of handwritten postcards and love letters. You snatch at a phrase in fear and hope, an image of the sea and another called \u201cUntitled\u201d (Cold Blue Snow) \u2013 which sends you back to that blue mirror. All his works are called \u201cUntitled\u201d, but the parentheses give context. We know, for example, that what looks like the side wall of an anonymous barn is in fact an image of the New Hampshire home of David Souter, former US associate chief justice, a controversial George HW Bush appointee. Other images focus on a judge\u2019s hands resting on his knees; street \u201ccelebrations\u201d following the return of soldiers from the first gulf war; a pack of Bazooka bubblegum.      \u201cUntitled\u201d (March 5th) #2    These images stutter across the walls and you have to get up close, grasping for connections. There are family groups here, a pair of unoccupied beach loungers, a couple of raccoons in the branches of a tree, their eyes wide in the camera\u2019s flash. Pairing, dividing, splitting and joining were part of this artist\u2019s repertoire, both as a formal device and signalling relationships: twinning, merging and dividing, like cells, like people and like thoughts. Things cleave together as well as apart.  While these puzzle pictures face off across the gallery, two larger works also acknowledge each other. Two bare lightbulbs in \u201cUntitled\u201d (March 5th) hang high on one wall, their cables descending to white electrical transformers and entangling on the floor. The flare of light melds and separates in the eye. Opposite, two tall mirrors stand vertically, a hand\u2019s breadth (and perhaps a breath) apart in \u201cUntitled\u201d (Orpheus, Twice).  When Orpheus looked back at Eurydice, the underworld reclaimed her and she disappeared. How many ways are there to look at Gonzalez-Torres\u2019s mirrors? How do we see ourselves in them, and spy on others? Each mirror could frame a human figure as well as reflect it. Each could be a door we might pass through. Everything here is on a wall. The space between is like a clearing or a wasteland. The gallery floor feels charged rather than empty. It is all a puzzle.  Ault worked with Gonzalez-Torres in the New York collective Group Material, and has edited an excellent book about his art. Gonzalez-Torres got to know Horn after he and Laycock saw a single gold leaf field by Horn, laid on the floor in a museum show in LA in 1990. Discussing her work, Gonzalez-Torres wrote that \u201cthe act of looking at an object, any object, is transfigured by gender, race, socioeconomic class and sexual orientation\u201d. And much else besides.      \u201cUntitled\u201d (Orpheus, Twice)    Both directly and indirectly, much of Gonzalez-Torres\u2019s own work concerned the Aids crisis, and it is difficult not to see his art in the light of his death from Aids-related illnesses in 1996. But not all its meaning is found there. His output retains its presence \u2013 touching on love and delight, on loss and yearning, on the personal and the political. It has not aged or become outdated. But his characteristic lightness of touch does demand a similar sensitivity to the conditions and qualities of space from his curators, and Ault and Horn provide it. It is unlikely many people will see all three shows, though I wish I could. \u2022 Felix Gonzalez-Torres is at Hauser & Wirth, London, from 27 May to 30 July; Andrea Rosen, New York, until 18 June; and Massimo De Carlo, Milan, until 20 July.",
