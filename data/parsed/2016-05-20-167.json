  "body": "Venezuela\u2019s embattled president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is \u201cmad as a goat\u201d, according to Uruguay\u2019s former leader Jos\u00e9 \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica. Mujica\u2019s comments came after Maduro accused the head of the Organization of American States (OAS) of being a \u201ctraitor\u201d and CIA agent.  \u201cThey\u2019re all crazy in Venezuela,\u201d Mujica said. \u201cI have great respect for Maduro, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t say \u2018You\u2019re crazy, you\u2019re as mad as a goat.\u2019\u201d Maduro responded at a party rally on Thursday, telling his supporters: \u201cYes, I\u2019m mad as a goat, it\u2019s true. \u201cI\u2019m mad with love for Venezuela, for the Bolivarian Revolution, for Ch\u00e1vez and his example.\u201d Venezuela\u2019s government is grappling with street protests, a shrinking economy, chronic food shortages, and power cuts. Maduro, who says that the country\u2019s problems are caused by rightwingers and foreign plots, has resisted opposition calls for a referendum on his rule.  Earlier this week the OAS chief Luis Almagro \u2013 who previously served as Mujica\u2019s foreign minister \u2013 warned the Venezuelan leader that he risked becoming \u201cjust another petty dictator\u201d, and called on him to hold the recall referendum.  Maduro responded to Almagro by denouncing a supposed \u201cmedia war\u201d against him, and accusing Almagro of being a \u201clongtime traitor\u201d.  Asked about the row on Thursday, Mujica \u2013 who is currently a senator in the Uruguayan congress \u2013 said: \u201cThe problem is trying to solve the economic problem in Venezuela. A country can\u2019t live fighting, Venezuelans have to find a way to solve things between them.\u201d Mujica, who ruled Uruguay from 2010 to 2015, refused to live in Uruguay\u2019s presidential palace and lived instead in his own slant-roof three-room ranch 20 minutes outside the capital city of Montevideo. But despite his eccentricities, Mujica carried forward a forceful progressive agenda, making Uruguay the first South American nation to legalize abortion and the first country in the world to legalize the sale of marijuana.Venezuela meanwhile is suffering a deep economic crisis and the world\u2019s highest inflation rate. Opposition marches during the last few days have demanded Maduro\u2019s resignation, while food and medicine scarcities have become chronic. This was not the first time the plain-spoken Uruguayan has disparaged a serving South American president. In April 2013, Mujica was caught on an open microphone describing Argentina\u2019s then-president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. \u201cThe old woman is worse than the one-eyed guy,\u201d Mujica said, referring to Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s husband and predecessor in office N\u00e9stor Kirchner who strabismus resulting in a misaligned eye. \u201cHe was was more political, this one is stubborn,\u201d Mujica said.",
