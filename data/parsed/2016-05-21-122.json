  "body": "The planter Nina Baxter, garden designer, and head of an all-woman planting team for Jo Thompson\u2019s show gardens The first show I did for [designer] Andy Sturgeon, I did about seven plants in one day. The next day, I asked Andy what he thought. He said, \u201cWell, it could be a bit better. Maybe start again?\u201d I had to take out everything I\u2019d done. But after a while, your eye locks in and you start to see how it should be \u2013 it\u2019s that balance between making everything look natural and not showing vast amounts of soil. At the end, I go through and every now and then take out a plant. It\u2019s amazing how much better it looks. You\u2019ve got to think of every angle: the judges look under things, over things, behind things \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to have that planted up. Yuko Tanabe on our team comes from Japan every year; she\u2019s tiny, so can get into awkward places to plant. By the end of the week, everyone is slightly manic, because you\u2019ve all been working 14-hour days. Whatever the weather, you know you have a deadline: you have to get that garden done. Thousands of plants have to be offloaded from trucks. The big trees and shrubs tend to be put in by the landscape team; the planting team deal with smaller shrubs, roses and perennials \u2013 about 6,000 plants. It is difficult to concentrate with lorries continually going past, and when people are stone-cutting, you get covered in dust. But the worst thing is when the plane trees on Main Avenue dump their pollen. It\u2019s horrible: you get it in the back of your throat and in your eyes \u2013 they call it Chelsea flu. Everyone hopes for a big strong wind overnight so it takes it off the trees all in one go. You\u2019ve got to constantly look after the plants, nurture them, deadhead them, put up shade tents \u2013 they\u2019ve got to look perfect. I\u2019m a garden designer as well, and I battle against people who want their gardens to be like Chelsea. I tell them, this is a picture of a garden at one particular time of year, and that the same garden in August would have very little going on. But you might spot some trends or a plant combination, and adapt those ideas. It\u2019s very important to have a good shed behind the show garden, because it becomes your home for the duration of the build. We had massive shed envy last year: James Basson, who did the L\u2019Occitane garden, had a coffee machine in his, so we were sneaking in to get cups of espresso. There\u2019s that moment when the planting team finishes and the sponsor\u2019s team comes in to manage the garden for show week. It\u2019s a difficult moment, because you feel real ownership of it, and you\u2019re so tired and emotional. It\u2019s like your baby. The veteran     Ricky Dorlay, master plantsman: \u2018It\u2019s a stress at times, but it is a challenge I enjoy.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    Ricky Dorlay, master plantsman, Hillier Nurseries, Hampshire This is my 51st Chelsea for Hillier Nurseries. We take 3,500-4,000 plants to Chelsea, and my job is to get them to the show in prime condition. The company\u2019s going for its 71st gold medal, as I am for my 51st. It\u2019s a big team effort. There\u2019s a great friendship, a lot of laughs. I\u2019ve got to know the other teams, and there\u2019s a lot of camaraderie. People will joke, \u201cOh, no, not you again \u2013 haven\u2019t you retired yet?\u201d Our exhibit features a lot of structural plants \u2013 some of the cornus and Japanese maples have been going to Chelsea for 20 or 30 years. It can be quite a stress on plants, and it takes them a year or two to get over it, as it does us. One year, I had flowering cherries in prime condition, put them on the lorry, but there was an accident and we were held up for three hours. By the time we got to London, they were in full flower, so they all had to go home again. I\u2019m 76 this year. I can\u2019t deny that, inwardly, I\u2019ll know when the time comes to stop going. It\u2019s a stress at times, but it is a challenge I enjoy. It\u2019s all about getting another gold.. The young plantsman     Jamie Butterworth, nurseryman: \u2018It\u2019s the World Cup of gardening.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    Jamie Butterworth, show plant manager, Hortus Loci nursery, Hampshire, raising plants for five Main Avenue show gardens I start work at 6am and leave about 6 or 7pm; it\u2019s pretty full on, but I love it. Because I\u2019ve spent so long talking to the designers, I\u2019ll be picking the plants that most fit the garden they are creating. We\u2019ll be sending up around 20,000 plants for Main Avenue gardens, plus trade stands, and the smaller gardens. I\u2019ll go on press day \u2013 I\u2019ve managed to blag myself a ticket. I\u2019ve always said I would swap Christmas for press day, because I love it so much. I first worked at Chelsea when I was 16, and I\u2019ve been back every year since. I am 21 now. I\u2019m an RHS ambassador for secondary schools. I\u2019ll go into schools to show them that gardening isn\u2019t just weeding; it\u2019s working with multimillion-pound gardens and designers, travelling the world to find plants, even working with Nasa on growing plants in space. I love the pressure, the adrenaline. You work for as long as you can, as hard as you can, then you go to the pub afterwards. It\u2019s the World Cup of gardening. The judge     James Alexander-Sinclair, RHS judge: \u2018Occasionally, judging panels go a bit crazy.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    James Alexander-Sinclair, garden designer and RHS show garden judge I\u2019ve been judging at Chelsea since 2008, and I consider it an honour: it means people trust what you say. Over the last three or four years, we\u2019ve tried to make the judging process as transparent as possible. If a judge says, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t like that\u201d, they have to justify why. There are some shoo-in gold medals, but there are always gardens that surprise you: you walk on thinking one thing and another when you walk off \u2013 maybe you\u2019ve seen something, or something has been pointed out to you by the other judges, and your mind has been changed. Each garden will have 45 minutes spent on judging it. It\u2019s a democratic process: there\u2019s debate and chat. We try to keep it fun, but serious. Occasionally, judging panels go a bit crazy. We all swoop and say, \u201cThis is the most amazing garden.\u201d Then a moderator comes along and says, \u201cDid you realise there\u2019s a whole patch over here that\u2019s dead?\u201d The moderator is there to make sure the judging is consistent. I\u2019ve judged gardens that didn\u2019t get gold medals, but I\u2019ve adored them; they were lovely places to be, but maybe the brick wall wasn\u2019t straight or the trees hadn\u2019t quite come into leaf. What you are looking for is excellence, and excellence doesn\u2019t mean \u201cquite good\u201d. I know by Monday lunchtime who has won a gold medal and best in show. We\u2019re sworn to secrecy and won\u2019t tell anybody until Tuesday morning, so that\u2019s hard, but one copes. You wander around looking smug. The broadcaster     Abdullai Adejumo, BBC producer-director: \u2018I\u2019ve never been to Chelsea before.\u2019 Photograph: Rebecca Rees for the Guardian    Abdullai Adejumo, producer-director of BBC television\u2019s Chelsea coverage I\u2019ve never been to Chelsea before, but I know it\u2019s the greatest flower show there is. We\u2019ll be broadcasting about 13 hours of TV, starting 22 May; both live coverage and films we\u2019ve produced in advance. I\u2019ve worked on The One Show, so the pace of it won\u2019t faze me \u2013 we are filming stuff on the ground that will go on TV that day; there\u2019s a lot of pressure to make it look good. You\u2019ve got to be able to deliver in record time. There will be about 150 BBC staff at Chelsea; I am one of 10 directors, each with a crew, a cameraman and a soundman. We\u2019ll be on our feet pretty much all day. I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed for sun. I have a garden and a lawnmower, and I\u2019m hoping Chelsea will inspire me. I want to get the best out of it personally, but also professionally \u2013 the best footage, the best stories. I am looking forward to getting inside some of the gardens and learning what all the fuss is about. The visitor     Rosemary Cox, regular Chelsea visitor: \u2018We have an all-day ticket, so we\u2019re not rushing.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    Rosemary Cox has been going to Chelsea for more than 30 years I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. My parents used to go, too, so I heard all about it for many years. Eventually I got to go, with my late husband John, more than 30 years ago. There were carnations everywhere, plus lupins and sweetpeas; there was one stand of McBeans orchids \u2013 they were really exotic. Now I go with my daughter; we have an all-day ticket, so we\u2019re not rushing.   Related: Gardens: eat seeds and leaves    I\u2019ll wait patiently to see the gardens, but people take photographs, which is fine \u2013 but then they look at them to see if they\u2019re all right and that takes ages, whereas I\u2019d snap, then move on. But that\u2019s people, isn\u2019t it? And they all love the gardens, so you can\u2019t get cross. Chelsea-goers are very friendly, because you all share a love of horticulture. It tends to be the grey pound, and I\u2019m very grey. Older people have the time and probably more of the money and interest. As long as I can still get around, I\u2019ll keep coming \u2022 Follow the Guardian\u2019s RHS Chelsea coverage at theguardian.com/chelsea-flower-show",
