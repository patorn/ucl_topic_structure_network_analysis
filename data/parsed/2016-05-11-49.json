  "body": "\u2022 A report about the conviction of two men for insider trading described one of them, Andrew Hind, as \u201ca former adviser to Sir Philip Green\u201d. Arcadia has contacted us to say that Hind has never been an adviser to Green, or an employee of any company controlled by him. Hind, who was finance director at Topshop in the 1990s, was employed by the Arcadia group before Green and his family took control of the business (Ex-Deutsche Bank executive found guilty of insider dealing, 10 May, page 18). \u2022 Because of an editing error, the illustration that accompanied an Opinion article (Labour\u2019s fight won\u2019t be settled until 2020 \u2013 that\u2019s way too late, 7 May, page 33) was wrongly credited to Noma Bar. The illustrator was in fact Nate Kitch. \u2022 A regular offender made an appearance in a picture caption that described the boxer Amir Khan as being counted out while lying prone in the ring. To be prone, a person must lie face down, not face up as Khan was. On your spine is supine (\u00c1lvarez blow leaves bruised Khan with few title options, 9 May, page 8, Sport). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Senior Northumbria police officers \u2018used flat at force\u2019s HQ for affair\u2019 Why that chart demonstrating Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election success is misleading",
