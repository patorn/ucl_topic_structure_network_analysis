History reveals that nothing has more power to undermine democratic institutions than the boundless fear of a foreign enemy.   Related: How the Pentagon punished NSA whistleblowers | Mark Hertsgaard    Rogue Justice is Karen Greenberg\u2019s splendid new book about all the ways liberty was assaulted in America in the decade after the cataclysm of 11 September 2001. In these years, she writes, America came \u201cperilously close\u201d to \u201closing the protections of the bill of rights\u201d.  After the towers of the World Trade Center disintegrated and the Pentagon was set aflame, the administration of George W Bush systematically exploited the panic of a horrified country to dramatically expand its own powers. It never hesitated to undermine \u201cthe rights to freedom of speech and religion, to freedom from capricious searches and seizures, to due process and fair treatment, and to protections from cruel and unusual punishment\u201d\u2013 in other words, all of privileges guaranteed by the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth amendments to the US constitution. Greenberg is director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University in New York. She begins her book with the astonishing intelligence failure that may have made 9/11 possible.  An FBI field agent in Minneapolis had filed a report about Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent who had paid $8,300 in cash to get time on a flight academy\u2019s 747 simulator. As part of a request for a search warrant to examine Moussaoui\u2019s computer \u2013 after agents had jailed him when they discovered he had overstayed his visa \u2013 the agent wrote: \u201cThis is a guy who could fly an airplane into the World Trade Center.\u201d  It turned out that the computer contained what Greenberg calls a \u201ctrove of information\u201d about the hijackers and their plans. The FBI, however, only found that out after the 9/11 attacks.  Washington never acted on the agent\u2019s request for a warrant, which required the approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court. But the court never even received a request for the warrant, because a Fisa judge had accused the FBI of \u201croutinely lying in the affidavits used to obtain court orders, and agents had become unwilling to stick out their necks by approaching the court for the warrants it could issue\u201d.  This failure to crack the biggest terrorism case the FBI ever had set off a stream of decisions in federal courts and Congress that were designed to free the intelligence community of nearly all the restraints the Fisa court had imposed on surveillance activities since its creation in 1978.  Greenberg meticulously describes how these actions created a system in which virtually all communications in America by e-mail or telephone could be swept up, in a vast government effort that mostly remained secret for more than a decade. A principal defender of the new surveillance policy, and much of the rest of the \u201crogue justice\u201d detailed by Greenberg, was deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo, who gleefully \u201cignored some of the most sacred principles of American democracy and law\u201d , sometimes without even bothering to inform his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft. Yoo often preferred to work directly with the White House, where his crucial ally was David Addington, a member of the office of Vice-President Dick Cheney. Yoo was the perfect ally for a White House that wasn\u2019t interested in \u201clegal nuance\u201d. Presidential aides, Greenberg writes, wanted advice not \u201cto guide them in determining which policies were legal, but, rather, to provide plausible cover for the policies they wanted to impose\u201d.  Yoo\u2019s vilest contributions to the war on terror were his memos legalizing torture. Those who knew the most about effective interrogation techniques \u2013including more than three dozen retired admirals and generals \u2013 believed that torture was completely counterproductive. Cheney and his minions were convinced, though, that when terrorists were interrogated it was essential to \u201cgo to the dark side\u201d.  Yoo asserted in one memo that \u201cany effort by Congress to regulate the interrogation of battlefield detainees would violate the constitution\u2019s sole investing of the commander-in-chief authority in the president.\u201d  As Greenberg points out, this was \u201can extreme and unprecedented position, one with sweeping consequences for all laws, both military and civilian, concerning the treatment of prisoners\u201d. After Ashcroft made Jack Goldsmith the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department, Goldsmith concluded that Yoos\u2019s memo seemed \u201cdesigned to confer immunity for bad acts\u201d and made arguments \u201cwildly broader than was necessary to support what was actually being done\u201d. Publicly, though, the Bush administration called the torture \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d. Many news organizations accepted the term, and the truth about this disastrous policy would not come out until the Senate finally issued its torture report, in December 2014.    Related: Senate report on CIA torture claims spy agency lied about 'ineffective' program    When it did so, California\u2019s Dianne Feinstein declared: \u201cIt is my personal conclusion that, under any common meaning of the term, CIA detainees were tortured.\u201d The program, she said, \u201cwas not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees\u201d.  Greenberg concludes with the mixed progress made by the Obama administration in redressing the excesses of its predecessor. The new president repudiated torture, but he allowed those who had carried out the previous policy to go unpunished.  He also was responsible for his own dramatic expansion of presidential power \u2013 the right to kill American citizens by drone, if they are considered terrorists.  The only unqualified heroes in the book are the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who in leaks to outlets including the Guardian revealed the appalling scope of government surveillance, and the lawyers of the American Civil Liberties Union, who filed more cases challenging the anti-terrorist policies of both administrations than anyone else. \u201cThey may have accomplished less than they hoped,\u201d writes Greenberg, \u201cbut they have at least succeeded at pulling off the veil.\u201d  By connecting so many of the dots in the War on Terror, the author has made her own very important contribution to this process.
