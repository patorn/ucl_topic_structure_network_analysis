What job, for example, awaits you after reading literature, art or philosophy at university? The answer is that there isn\u2019t just one type of career on offer. Arts and humanities graduates end up in sectors as diverse as healthcare and computing. \u201cThe employment opportunities are greater than ever before,\u201d says Emma Hunt, deputy vice-chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth, who says the idea of arts students being less employable is an outdated one. \u201cCreative graduates are no longer tied to just one segment of the employment landscape.\u201d Often employers are less bothered by what students study, and more concerned that they have \u201cthe right thinking skills and creative skills \u2013 and that they can apply themselves to the job at hand\u201d, says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters.  So whether you want to work in communications, education, or law \u2013 they are plenty of options for arts and humanities graduates. Most jobs don\u2019t require specific undergraduate qualifications, \u201cso recruiters are simply looking for broader skills,\u201d adds Isherwood.
