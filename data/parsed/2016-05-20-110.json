  "body": "The press at Cannes are for a notoriously vocal audience, eager to express their verdict on a film through energetic applause or noisy boos. This year, spontaneous clapping greeted one impromptu song in Palme d\u2019Or frontrunner Toni Erdmann, while Personal Shopper and The Neon Demon were among the higher-profile premieres to earn groans of disapproval.    Related: The Last Face review \u2013 African conflict is aphrodisiac for white people in Sean Penn's crass romance    But the reception to Sean Penn\u2019s fifth film as director easily beat all three in both decibels and persistency. Laughter at dialogue in the earnest romantic drama about two foreign aid doctors in war-torn Africa began early, soon turned to hooting, and then to boos as the credits rolled. A string of one-star reviews filtered through a few hours later. Speaking at a press conference the same afternoon, Penn dismissed questions about such criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s finished, the film,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s not a discussion I feel I can add value to.\u201d Asked whether his years as an actor meant he was better able to manage the egos and personalities on set, he said: \u201cYour first challenge is dealing with your own ego on anything you\u2019re doing.\u201d Penn is a veteran of the Croisette. He won the best actor award nearly 30 years ago, has starred in many of the festival\u2019s biggest films, premiered two of his movies as director in France (1991\u2019s The Indian Runner and 2001\u2019s The Pledge) and chaired the jury in 2008.      Bardem and Theron in the film    He recalled his jury experience as highly instructive. \u201cIn America, unless we really pursue it, we have a very monocultural selection of films. To come to Cannes and be forced to go to two movies a day for a couple of weeks makes you realise: \u2018Oh, we are not better than a Filipino director.\u2019\u201d Such exposure was invaluable, he said, to \u201creally get sense of what\u2019s going on with world cinema\u201d. Some critics have found fault with the film for its foregrounding of a romance between two white outsiders \u2013 played by Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem \u2013 in an African tragedy. The pair play doctors who fall in love while treating refugees and the victims of civil war in Liberia and South Sudan. In one early scene, Theron explains that a concert fundraiser is required in order for westerners to listen to stories about such conflict.      Theron and Bardem at the press conference. Photograph: Laurent Emmanuel/AFP/Getty Images    Asked if he felt the central story in his film was an equivalent sop, Penn said: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to entertain if entertainment is not synonymous with Donald Trump\u2019s behaviour. Too much of film is today, I think. Greek tragedy is almost forgotten. The hunger now, I\u2019ve found, is pulling us away from our humanity.\u201d In the film, Theron\u2019s character protests that Europe and the US could stop this sort of conflict if they intervened in the correct way. Penn did not respond directly when asked if he agreed, but said: \u201cTo find beauty in things is the way to fix things. I just think that what we\u2019re calling beauty today is largely a perversion of it. That\u2019s lamentable.\u201d Penn also spoke of coming to feel that \u201cthe only genius is generosity and we see less and less of it\u201d as well of a \u201cstrange dichotomy\u201d between the levels of privilege and suffering currently seen.    Related: Cannes 2016: Sean Penn faces a stinker and The Neon Demon glows \u2013 the Dailies film podcast    Bardem discussed his admiration for the real-life doctors currently working in Africa and countries such as Syria, as well as saying that, for him, \u201cheroes are normal people trying to feed their kids with a horrible salary or unemployment\u201d. His co-star, Jean Reno, said that the immersive shoot had helped him feel more medically competent. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like we were making in the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in the middle of the night, in the jungle, trying to save a baby and his mother. When I saw the movie, I thought: \u2018Wow! I\u2019m a doctor!\u2019\u201d Penn reported that his experience of meeting foreign aid workers had led him to believe such an occupation \u201ctends to draw people who have a hunger for adrenalin\u201d. The director, who was at one stage engaged to Theron, made reference to the \u201cintimacies created in risky situations \u2013 whether they be creative or life threatening\u201d before concluding: \u201cI have found working with people in the field that certainly a part of what drives them is not all altruistic. It\u2019s chemical.\u201d",
