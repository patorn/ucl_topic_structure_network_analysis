  "body": "The Arts party has bold policies for the 2016 election \u2013 to triple arts funding and make big companies pay a special 0.2% tax on their revenue to pay for a cultural renaissance in Australia. But it\u2019s the party\u2019s unorthodox approach to politics that\u2019s grabbing attention. Which other party can boast it has a poet in residence? The party leader, Patrick James Collins, a maker of short films, said: \u201cIt\u2019s about time a political party had a poet in residence \u2013 he\u2019s up in Brisbane, busy writing poems about the election. I would call on all major parties to get one.\u201d His name is Eido Boru and he\u2019s already written a swag of poems for the party\u2019s cause. One is a haiku: \u201cWant one million votes / For the balance of power / Wear an Arts T-shirt\u201d.     The leader of the Arts party, Patrick James Collins, says \u2018it\u2019s about time a political party had a poet in residence\u2019. Photograph: Arts party    The at times didactic poems paint a vision of fostering an Australian Banksy or creating another Mad Max. \u201cLet\u2019s keep our talent / Creating at home / No more buggering off / To New York, London, Paris or Rome.\u201d Collins told Guardian Australia arts funding is the party\u2019s main cause. \u201cIt\u2019s essential in a country with an ever-growing population that the budget for arts and culture should be growing too. But support for arts and culture is shrinking. It makes no sense.\u201d The Arts party has policy ideas for the arts beyond tipping more money in, such as mandatory music and art education in primary schools. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a rounded education without a serious dose of arts,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an optional extra as it is treated now.\u201d The party is running Senate candidates in every state and lower-house seats in New South Wales and Victoria. The Arts party candidates include gallery owners, arts educators and administrators. The party has received endorsements from a number of high-profile actors and artists including Bryan Brown, Ben Quilty, Lex Marinos and Geraldine Turner. In a video endorsement Brown says: \u201cSo why not an arts party? We\u2019ve got a Shooters party, a Motoring Enthusiasts party. But the arts play a hugely significant part in our quality of life and our wellbeing here in Australia.\u201d         The Australian actor Bryan Brown\u2019s endorsement for the Arts party.    The actress and singer Geraldine Turner said: \u201cThe arts are at the centre of all our lives \u2013 not something we push aside. I also happen to believe music should be compulsory in all schools. Arts education is incredibly important if we are to nurture ourselves as we grow up.\u201d         Geraldine Turner says \u2018we must give a voice to the arts in this forthcoming election\u2019.     The painter Ben Quilty said: \u201cIn my country at the moment the arts are under siege \u2013 art schools, Tafes, art education are all slowly being dismantled.\u201d The party says arts are not a left or right-wing issue. Collins describes it as \u201ca non-political political party\u201d and says he is a \u201cnon-political arts-lover\u201d who has never been a member of a political party nor worked in arts administration. The idea, like many great works of art, was hatched in a pub. \u201cWe sat in the pub, talking about the state of the arts about three years ago,\u201d said Collins, who is leading the charge but not standing as a candidate. \u201cWe had the brainwave \u2013 someone to keep the bastards honest. \u201cThe only thing that qualifies me is that I got off my backside. Thousands of people have sat in the pub and thought about forming the Arts party \u2013 I actually did it.\u201d   Related: Arts workers should be angry about funding cuts \u2013 we can't work harder for less    Government support for the arts has undergone significant changes and cuts since the 2013 election. The 2014 budget cut Australia Council funding by $28.2m over four years. The 2015 budget then redirected $105m over four years from the Australia Council to a national program for excellence in the arts, a program that allowed the arts minister to dole out arts grants. That program became the Catalyst Australian arts and culture fund, which gives $12m a year to small and medium-sized organisations delivering \u201cinnovative projects\u201d. The 2015 midyear economic update the government imposed a 3% efficiency dividend on cultural and collecting institutions \u2013 except the Australia Council \u2013 a total cut of $36.8m over four years. Cultural institutions including the National Gallery of Australia, National Portrait Gallery and National Library have warned they may have to sack staff as a result. The 2016 budget maintained base funding of the ABC but cut funding for specialist news services by $18.6m over the next three years.     Ben Quilty, one of the artists to have lent their support to the Arts party, says \u2018the arts are under siege\u2019 in Australia. Photograph: Arts party    The chief executive of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Paul Murphy, said: \u201cThe arts community is the place where we know the adage \u2018from little things big things grow\u2019 is absolutely true. The lack of funding and incentive for talented young people hoping for a break means the well of Australian talent will be far drier than it ought to be. \u201cWe can now only hope that a federal election will act as a circuit breaker and that the open hostility demonstrated towards arts funding is reversed.\u201d The Arts party policy says that tripling funding to artists and small and medium-sized organisations would cost $124m a year in increased funding to the Australia Council. The party has a number of suggestions for raising revenue, a shopping list of progressive measures including legalising and taxing cannabis, capping the number of investment properties people can use to negatively gear, tightening superannuation tax concessions and imposing a super profits tax on banks. Another proposal is a 0.2% levy on the revenue of corporations with a turnover of more than $100m to pay for community projects, which can only be offset by other donations to arts organisations. Are these the ideas of a non-political political party? \u201cWe have governments to make us the best we can be, to invest back in us,\u201d Collins said.   Related: Arts minister promises to ditch Brandis-style 'out of the blue' funding changes    \u201cAll these are just ideas, we\u2019re not going to implement any of these ... A few wacky tax ideas is not necessarily what we\u2019re about \u2013 we want to see people voting for their cultural lives and opportunities for their children, the next generation of actors and stars.  \u201cAll the stages and arts organisations are disappearing. We didn\u2019t want it to appear as though we hadn\u2019t thought about money, so we said \u2018here are our ideas\u2019.\u201d The shadow arts minister, Mark Dreyfus, said: \u201cLabor will return all unspent funds to the Australia Council that were cut from the 2015 budget, abolish Catalyst and restore integrity to the arts funding process in this country. \u201cLabor is the party of the arts. There will be further announcements on Labor\u2019s arts policy during the campaign.\u201d The Greens policy calls for increased access to arts and culture in rural and regional Australia and for the national curriculum to give Australian children a rich and varied arts education. Collins said the party wants to win 1m votes, for a chance to capture a Senate seat or at least to send a message to the major parties to value the arts. The party has registration to contest local government elections in New South Wales and will register and contest state elections in that state and Victoria. It claims to have a paid membership of 2,000 and has raised $41,000 through crowdfunding for its federal election campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re here for the long haul,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere. \u201cEveryone talks the talk, only some walk the walk on arts policy. Even Labor\u2019s approach of putting back two years\u2019 of funding, that\u2019s the best offer from the major parties. We want five steps forward not two steps back.\u201d",
