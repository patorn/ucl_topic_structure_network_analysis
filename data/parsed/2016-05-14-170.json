  "body": "On a desk in Oldham police station is a grey box file. Written on its lid is \u201cJohn Doe\u201d, beneath a photo of a grey track winding up a rocky moorland valley. I know the track quite well. It\u2019s on Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester, and takes you from Dovestone reservoir at the bottom of the valley, to the smaller Chew reservoir, which, when it was built in 1912, was England\u2019s highest, at 488 metres. Close by, in Greenfield, lies the Clarence pub, built from the burnt-looking millstone grit that is used in most of Saddleworth\u2019s older buildings. The closest pub to Dovestone reservoir, it\u2019s popular with daytrippers, but when I drop in one spring afternoon the place is deserted save for a table of four men in their 60s, walkers sitting around their emptied lunch plates. Once the pub has cleared out, Mel Robinson, the landlord, comes and sits with me while I finish my pint. He speaks solemnly, wanting to focus on the facts of what happened that afternoon five months ago. At about 2pm on 11 December 2015 a stranger walked in. Tall, white, with receding grey hair, brown eyes and a prominent nose, he looked about 70. \u201cIt seems like I\u2019m the last person to talk to him,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cIt was cold outside, and going dark already. Overcast. It rained all day the day before, and it rained all day the day after.\u201d It being the quiet period after lunch, he was sitting at the end of the bar. He got up, but the stranger didn\u2019t want a drink: \u201cHe wanted to walk to \u2018the top of the mountain\u2019. It was unusual, the way he was dressed. He was wearing just a light mac, normal trousers and shirt, and slip-on shoes.\u201d The top of the mountain. That was unusual, too. Walkers often come in for directions, but this isn\u2019t mountain country, and the locals don\u2019t use the noun of even the highest escarpments. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say Indian\u2019s Head, he didn\u2019t say Dovestone reservoir. He just said \u2018the top of the mountain\u2019.\u201d    There has been speculation he was a spy. 'My left testicle,' a local reporter tells me. 'But he belonged to someone'    Robinson thought about the highest accessible place nearby, and gave the man directions to Chew reservoir. Then he walked him to the door. \u201cPast those gates,\u201d he told him, indicating the footpath that leads to Dovestone reservoir, \u201cthat\u2019s the easier walk.\u201d He added that he wouldn\u2019t get there and back before dark, but the man simply asked him to repeat the directions, thanked him and went on his way. Robinson thought no more about it until the next day. \u201cThe police came in to see if I knew him, if he\u2019d been in. It\u2019s a mystery to us. We\u2019d all like to understand what\u2019s happened.\u201d People getting off the train at Greenfield sometimes ask the way to Saddleworth. \u201cYou\u2019re in it,\u201d Richelle Walsh, the station assistant, will tell them. She may explain that Saddleworth is not actually a village, but a civil parish of 10 or so villages and hamlets scattered around the river Tame. Saddleworth Moor itself lies above the villages, forming the north-western edge of the Dark Peak. I make my way past Dovestone reservoir, with its sailing club and dog walkers, and on to the track. It\u2019s four years since I was last here, researching a book. On that occasion, the moor\u2019s gullies and hollows were deep in crusted snow after blizzards the week before. When I reached Chew reservoir, I found it frozen over, the wind coming off it cold enough to bring tears to the eyes. This winter\u2019s snow has gone, but the vegetation is still sparse and the landscape\u2019s bareness makes you conscious of the violence of geological processes. As you look up the valley, the scene is almost colourless: the blacks of heather and peat scattered with paler moor grass and boulders of millstone grit. But the moor is beginning to revive. The curlews and grouse are tentatively calling, and I hear the odd lark. For all Saddleworth Moor\u2019s notoriety, it\u2019s never seemed anything but tranquil to me.   Related: Saddleworth Moor death: image of 'Neil Dovestone' released    It was about 10.50am on Saturday 12 December when the body was found by a cyclist. He was lying on his back, 700 metres down from Chew reservoir, at a place where the track widens to allow vehicles to pass. If he followed Robinson\u2019s directions, he\u2019d walked a little over 4km, much of it uphill. His arms were at his sides, his feet facing downhill. It is natural to assume that a man of his apparent age, found dead in an exposed location, has had a heart attack. In his right trouser pocket was \u00a3130 in \u00a310 notes. In his left coat pocket were three train tickets from the previous morning: a single from Ealing Broadway to London Euston (\u00a34.80), and a return from Euston to Manchester Piccadilly (\u00a381.50). The train from London, the 10am service, would have got him to Manchester just after midday, about two hours before he went into the Clarence. How he travelled the 17km from Manchester to Greenfield is unclear. Also in his coat pocket was a medicine box made of card. Inside was an empty container labelled thyroxine sodium, a drug produced by GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of hypothyroidism. The label was printed in both English and Urdu.     CCTV of the man at Manchester Piccadilly. Photograph: MEN media    Back in Greenfield, I meet Ken Bennett in the yard of the Clarence. A former Fleet Street journalist, Bennett has lived in the area for 50 of his 75 years. These days he\u2019s employed by the Oldham Evening Chronicle as a roving reporter for Saddleworth. He knows the case, and the region, better than most. Bennett was living nearby in Ashton-under-Lyne when he was posted here in 1965 to cover the search for the remains of the Moors murders victims. He remembers the mist. \u201cI\u2019d never been to Saddleworth. I thought it was like something from Great Expectations when I arrived.\u201d It\u2019s almost exactly 50 years since Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were sentenced, but the media still tend to mythologise the region, he says \u2013 \u201cthe constant reference back to the Moors murders\u201d \u2013 and the taint of their crimes persists. Even he refers to the moors as the \u201cshadowlands\u201d. As for the man who came here last December, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most unfathomable stories, it really is. He mightn\u2019t have known where he was going, but he was going on a journey, and he didn\u2019t want anyone to find him.\u201d The story has been picked up as far away as Japan and the US. An Australian news website speculated that the man was an international spy. \u201cMy left testicle\u2026 But I\u2019ll tell you this, he belongs to someone.\u201d *** John Coleman, the detective sergeant leading the investigation, was on the scene within half an hour of the discovery. It was clear it was an unusual case. For a start, the man was carrying no ID. No wallet. No cards. No keys, phone, watch or driving licence. \u201cUnless you\u2019re out running, for somebody in the modern age to have no identification on them whatsoever is almost unheard of.\u201d We are in his office in Oldham police station on a day of inexhaustible greyness. Coleman is a runner, and often follows the circuit round Dovestone reservoir and on to Saddleworth Moor. \u201cIt does have an air of being bleak and desolate,\u201d he says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to spend the night up there, but I consider it quite beautiful.\u201d Coleman has been in the force for 19 years and his vocabulary is partly that of the career detective: undertaking, demise, elimination, conducted. He sometimes pauses and smiles tightly while he works out how best to put something. In his mind\u2019s eye, a wife or a child is reading this. He and his colleagues, who are working on the investigation alongside the usual CID caseload of fraud, rapes and serious assaults, no longer call the man John Doe. \u201cThe people who work at the mortuary found it very difficult to have somebody in their\u2026\u201d He looks down at the folders on his desk, \u201c\u2026care, would you say? Who they didn\u2019t have a name for. So they gave him the name Neil Dovestone, after the reservoir.\u201d To him the man is now Neil, and that is how he refers to him during our conversations. \u201cThey would do the same thing for a baby,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a big why, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat led him to this? Why that day? Has there been a traumatic experience, or has it been a build up? Why travel in that way? Why Dovestone? Why climb up there, inappropriately dressed for the conditions? All these questions.\u201d Among the first thing Coleman\u2019s office did was cross-reference the man\u2019s DNA against the national criminal intelligence and missing persons databases. Neither provided a match. But the train tickets enabled him to trace Neil Dovestone\u2019s steps on CCTV, rewinding his journey from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston to Ealing Broadway. He was also filmed in Ealing on the morning of 11 December, walking towards the station. At Piccadilly, he went back and forth between the station shops for 53 minutes, bought a sandwich in Boots and spent about four minutes at the station information counter. It is a long time, four minutes, but it isn\u2019t known what he was asking about. He left the station at just after 1pm and walked towards the city centre; and that\u2019s the last footage of him to have been recovered. He has been described in the press as \u201csmartly dressed\u201d, but look at the CCTV stills and his smartness is that of many men of a particular age: white shirt, blue cords, blue jumper, brown jacket, all from Marks & Spencer, and the black, flat shoes Mel Robinson remembered, sold by Bally. \u201cHe looks like a gentleman who has had money at one stage,\u201d Coleman says, and indeed the cheapest loafers on the Bally website are \u00a3250. He is a big man (6ft 1in) with big hands; and yes, that nose is prominent \u2013 not long, so much as wide. (Bennett, half-joking, says he has a \u201cnorthern\u201d face, \u201clike an Easter Island head\u201d.) He looks neither unhappy nor anxious. In some images there\u2019s a trace of a smile. As he did not appear on CCTV at Greenfield, Saddleworth\u2019s only station, and the earliest bus would not have got him there until well after he went into the Clarence at about 2pm, it\u2019s assumed he took a taxi from Manchester. And yet, despite the unusual 45-minute fare, no taxi driver has responded to appeals. Nor have inquiries in Ealing resulted in any leads. Coleman describes the work he and Met colleagues have done there: \u201cHe\u2019d need to get his hair cut, let\u2019s go to all the barbers. He\u2019d need to go to the dentist, let\u2019s do the dentists. He\u2019d need a GP, let\u2019s do them. We went to bookmakers, we went to old people\u2019s homes, we went to local clubs, we produced posters.\u201d     Saddleworth Moor. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian    Which brings us to perhaps the strangest thing about the case: five months after Neil Dovestone died, and despite the media coverage, he is still unidentified. In January, someone contacted Coleman to tell him that their elderly neighbour in Camden matched the description in the news: the man hadn\u2019t been seen since 10 December, they explained, his front door had been left ajar, and he was known to make frequent trips to Manchester. \u201cSo we do those inquiries. Negative. He\u2019s alive and well, just left for no reason.\u201d Later that same month came a more promising lead. A man from Northern Ireland, Sean Toner, contacted Coleman. His father, Hugh, had gone missing from a Craigavon hospital in 1994 and had not been seen since. In photos, he bears a resemblance to the man in the CCTV images, even allowing for the 22 years that have elapsed. But when a DNA sample was taken from Sean Toner, it proved not to be a match. The calls continue to come in. Calls that are at once hopeful and full of dread. A brother, a husband, a father, an uncle, a cousin, a friend. During 2014\u201315, more than 137,000 people were recorded as missing in England and Wales. At the time I spoke to the UK Missing Persons Bureau, their database contained the details of 5,478 people missing for more than a month. \u201cAnd each one of the people that you speak to, it\u2019s tragic,\u201d says Coleman, \u201cbecause either way it\u2019s not good news: if it turns out it\u2019s not the person, well, the father or brother is still missing. Then again, if it is him, it\u2019s still bad news.\u201d Nor is Neil Dovestone\u2019s case unprecedented. In 2015\u201316, 126 reports were logged of bodies whose identity could not immediately be determined. Of these, only 80 have so far been identified. On Coleman\u2019s desk is a spiral-bound policy document, the first of three such case files, each an inch thick. Like the train tickets and the cash and the box that contained the medicine bottle, it is dog-eared. \u201cThe weather was horrendous,\u201d he says, and shows me a photograph of the track. You can barely see the valley bottom, so heavy is the rain. *** Up on the moor, a helicopter has been coming and going all afternoon, ferrying bags of fertiliser from the valley. On the plateau, you find acres of exposed peat where nothing grows, largely because of a century of acidifying pollution from the industrial centres that ring the Dark Peak: Stockport, Manchester, Huddersfield, Halifax, Barnsley, Rotherham, Sheffield. The quiet is broken, too, by planes making their approach to Manchester. In part, it\u2019s the proximity of the cities that accounts for Saddleworth Moor\u2019s notoriety. I trace my afternoon\u2019s route on the map and realise I have crossed Hollin Brown Knoll, where the bodies of two of the Moors Murders victims were found. It takes less than an hour to drive here from Manchester, and Brady and Hindley knew the moor well. (I felt no shiver at the time, of course. I was probably whistling.) Then there was the gravestone at the cemetery at St Chad\u2019s, dating from 1832: \u201cHere lie interred the dreadfully bruised and lacerated bodies of William Bradbury and Thomas his son both of Greenfield who were together savagely murdered in an unusually horrid manner.\u201d The murders took place at the Moorcock Inn, the ruins of which lie next to Dovestone reservoir. The crime became a local cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, both because the perpetrator was never identified and on account of its sheer bloodiness: according to the Manchester Courier, \u201cthe wall of the room, on three sides, was sprinkled with human blood, which had flown from the bodies of the murdered men, in consequence of heavy blows from some iron instrument.\u201d People in their thousands came to view the scene. You could even buy a commemorative plate. On the plateau above the reservoir, I\u2019d come across a crumbling stone cross marking the spot where James Platt, the MP for Oldham, was killed in 1857 \u201cby an accidental discharge of his own gun\u201d. More recently, in 1963, two ice-climbers were killed by an avalanche in Chew valley itself. If you spend enough time digging any piece of ground you will eventually unearth bones, but one of Coleman\u2019s early lines of inquiry was whether the setting itself \u2013 Saddleworth Moor \u2013 was significant. At the lower end of Chew valley is the towering millstone-grit outcrop known as Indian\u2019s Head. In outline, Indian\u2019s Head (Wimberry Stones on the OS map) looks more like the finned back of a stegosaurus than the recumbent head in profile from which it takes its local name. It was here, in August 1949, that a British European Airways DC-3, flying from Belfast to Manchester, crashed in fog. When I climb partway up the clough, I find the frame of the landing gear propped in the grass. Twenty-four people were killed. The local GP said at the time, \u201cI have been a doctor since 1914 and served in both wars, but this was the worst sight that I have ever seen.\u201d Among the eight survivors were two boys, Michael Prestwich, aged two, and Stephen Evans, who was five. Had one of them made a pilgrimage to the site? Coleman wondered. Was Neil in fact Michael or Stephen? But Prestwich, it turned out, had been killed 10 years later in a train crash, and when Coleman\u2019s theory was publicised, a 72-year-old professor of pharmacology, Stephen Evans, contacted Oldham CID to say he hadn\u2019t been to Saddleworth since that appalling day in 1949.    People have asked why we're making so much effort. But if it was your father, you'd want to know, wouldn't you?    On 11 January, a postmortem was carried out. The month\u2019s delay is accounted for by the coroner\u2019s reluctance to carry out the procedure before any family had been consulted. It did not reveal an immediate cause of death, but there was no reason to suspect it was anything other than a cardiac arrest. \u201cYou have to remember it had the appearance of just being \u2013 I don\u2019t want to make this sound flippant \u2013 but an everyday occurrence.\u201d On 29 January, with the man still unidentified, a secondary postmortem was done to investigate a scar on his left hip. As anticipated, fixed to the femur was a 10cm surgical titanium plate of a sort used in fractures. The hope was that it would carry an identifying number. The strength of the femur means it tends to fracture only after significant trauma \u2013 a road accident, or a fall from a height. The operation is not particularly common, and in the UK such plates are routinely numbered; but in this instance there was only a simple diagram indicating the angle at which the plate was to be implanted, and the logo of the manufacturer, Treu-Dynamic, whose website states: \u201cTreu Dynamic International (Pvt) Ltd was established in 1997 to provide quality services in the field of surgical, orthopaedic, spinal and maxillofacial instruments and implants in the Pakistan market.\u201d While the plate is also sold into Morocco, the fact that it did not carry an identifying number means it could only legally have been implanted in Pakistan. According to Treu-Dynamic, around 500 of these plates were distributed each year in Pakistan between 2001 and 2015, meaning approximately 7,000 during the relevant period. Assuming that half of the patients were male and half of the operations involved the left leg, the number who underwent this operation is around 1,750. (These are crude figures, Coleman stresses.) Since GlaxoSmithKline had confirmed that the thyroxine sodium was of a batch distributed only in Pakistan (hence the Urdu text), Coleman\u2019s attention was directed to that country. \u201cWhen you look at the CCTV,\u201d he says, \u201cthe gentleman looks white European.\u201d He\u2019s choosing his words very carefully. \u201cHe does, to my mind, and to everyone I\u2019ve spoken to. But when you see the deceased\u2026 it may be that he is from Pakistan.\u201d He won\u2019t say just what he means by this, but adds that the CCTV footage does not give a particularly representative impression of Neil Dovestone\u2019s face. He\u2019s keen to get a better likeness into the public domain, especially in Pakistan. \u201cClearly we can\u2019t use a photograph of a deceased person, so we\u2019ve had a forensic artist put an image together.\u201d     A forensic artist\u2019s impression of \u2018Neil Dovestone\u2019. Photograph: Greater Manchester Police    A few weeks later, the image arrives in my inbox. Here he is, finally. It\u2019s not what I expected. Less austere, less statuesque. It\u2019s not an Easter Island head. Even allowing for the licence taken by the forensic artist \u2013 whose job, after all is to conjure life into the dead \u2013 there is a softness to his eyes and something wry in the set of his mouth. His nose, Coleman says, looks like it might once have been broken. As is normal, the image has been rendered without colour, meaning that the nuances of skintone are lost; but Coleman is mindful that Pakistan\u2019s second-largest ethnic group, the Pashtuns, are often fair-skinned. What seems clear to me is that anyone who has spent time in the company of that face, with its lopsided nose, is likely to remember it. A dental examination showed his teeth to be in poor condition, but the forensic odontologist\u2019s view is that the work that had been carried out is likely to have been done in the UK. At Manchester Royal Infirmary, meanwhile, Prof David Mangham, an orthopaedic pathologist, is working to categorise Neil Dovestone\u2019s femur injury more precisely, age the scar and establish whether any suture material has been preserved that might narrow down the period or place of the operation. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got a specific type of fracture, along with a usable image, the surgeon may well be able to recognise their work,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cThe scenarios are, a) that he\u2019s a Pakistani national, b) that he\u2019s dual nationality, c) that he\u2019s gone out there and had an accident at work or in the army or whatever, or d) that he was a health tourist.\u201d By the time the surgical plate was analysed, the story of Neil Dovestone had shifted to a new, more discordant key. On 22 February, a routine toxicology report revealed an unusual alkaloid in his system: strychnine. Strychnine has been banned in the UK since 2006, when its only remaining legal use, in the killing of moles, was deemed unduly cruel. \u201cThere are very, very few deaths by strychnine poisoning,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible death.\u201d As a pesticide, it remains available in other countries, including Pakistan, where it is commonly used to cull feral dogs. When the empty thyroxine sodium bottle was analysed, it bore traces of the poison. By interfering with neurotransmitters that moderate nerve function, strychnine causes muscles to contract uncontrollably. It is partly the violence of its effects that accounts for the poison\u2019s regular appearance in Agatha Christie\u2019s novels. The ultimate cause of death, which does not come quickly, is asphyxiation. We can\u2019t say for sure that Neil Dovestone knew what the thyroxine sodium bottle contained, or even that he was alone when he died (although alternative scenarios seem farfetched), but it\u2019s fair to say that strychnine would not be the choice of someone who wished to go gently.     Indian\u2019s Head, Chew valley, the site of a plane crash in 1949. Was \u2018Neil Dovestone\u2019 among the survivors? Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian    \u201cMy father was a merchant seaman,\u201d Ken Bennett tells me. \u201cHe always said, never trust the sea; it broods, it\u2019s always watching you.\u201d Britain\u2019s earliest topographers often equated moorland with the sea: the rolling, treeless hills that resemble waves, the exposure and isolation and sense of imperilment. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear some wonderful, lyrical things about the moor, but I always think you treat it with massive respect. It holds an awful lot of secrets.\u201d It\u2019s persistent, this belief that a landscape can be not only unknowable, but inimical. \u201cNo community wants to be identified as somewhere you go to and you don\u2019t come back,\u201d he adds. \u201cSomewhere you just vanish.\u201d It seems that\u2019s just what Neil Dovestone came here to do. Looking downhill from the spot where he was found on that soaking morning five months ago, you can see the edge of Dovestone reservoir and vehicles passing along Holmfirth Road. Rising beyond the road, 3km away, is the millstone grit outcrop known as Pots and Pans, and the first world war obelisk that obtrudes from it. In mid-December, as night fell, the birds would have been silent, but the sound of Chew brook never ceases. DS Coleman is right: it is beautiful; but if you are looking for the pastoral, a landscape of consolation, this is not it. The reposefulness of the setting serves to emphasise not only the loneliness of Neil Dovestone\u2019s death, but its violence. With no lines of inquiry remaining open in the UK, Coleman has two hopes left: that either the forensic artist\u2019s image will be recognised, or Mangham\u2019s analysis of the femur injury will lead to a particular hospital or surgeon in Pakistan. \u201cThe whole ethos of this investigation has been different to most,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had family members die, and you\u2019d want to know, wouldn\u2019t you? If I\u2019d lost my father, I\u2019d want somebody to tell me. People have asked why we\u2019re putting so much effort into this case, and that\u2019s the reason; because the family needs to know.\u201d For now, Neil Dovestone\u2019s details remain logged on the Missing Persons database, awaiting the day when his real name will be returned to him.
