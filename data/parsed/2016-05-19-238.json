  "body": "With its wide seafront promenade, pretty marina, and many galleries, boutiques and authentic restaurants, Santa Eulalia, Ibiza\u2019s third-largest resort, is less raucous than some of the party island\u2019s other holiday hotspots. And on a quiet back street behind the main tourist hub, there\u2019s an unexpected shopping find too: Vintage Icons and Echoes, which is crammed with retro artefacts and designer gear. Every inch of the 1,000 sq ft space is stuffed with bargains, from corsets to genuine ringmaster\u2019s coats, 1950s cocktail dresses to 1920s nightgowns. You might find a Vivienne Westwood number or end-of-the-line Prada shoes at a fraction of the original price. There are wigs, hats, jewellery, magazines and kitsch ornaments. The decor\u2019s a little bit bonkers, with Action Man toys flying from the ceiling and a yeti made from seven goatskins.      British owner Elaine Walsh used to run the five-storey Afflecks Palace market in Manchester, until issues with the lease forced her to give it up \u2013 so she moved lock, stock and barrel to Ibiza last year. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun shop. It\u2019s not meant to be serious, and I wanted it to be affordable,\u201d says Elaine. So far, so good \u2013 it\u2019s been a hit with locals and curious tourists, who often come across it by chance. \u201cPeople find it amusing and there\u2019s always something new. I\u2019m constantly introducing and removing pieces \u2013 it\u2019s a bit like gardening!\u201d After browsing for a while, head to tree-lined Calle San Jaime to celebrate your purchases with a sangr\u00eda in the sunshine outside one of the many bars. My kind of shopping.\u2022 20 Calle de la Iglesia, Local D, Santa Eulalia",
