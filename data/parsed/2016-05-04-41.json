The footage \u2013 filmed on a cellphone during the battle, which lasted more than half a day \u2013 reveals the extent to which the US military is once again engaged in intense combat in Iraq.    Related: US Navy Seal killed by Isis in Iraq named as Charlie Keating IV    Provided to the Guardian by the lieutenant of an elite Kurdish peshmerga unit, the video shows a convoy of four by four vehicles coming under fire near Tel Osqof, a Christian town about 30km north of Mosul.  Amid the crackle of gunfire, peshmerga fighters and at least six US troops take cover behind an unarmored pickup truck on an arterial road leading into the town. One of the Americans appears to be saying \u201cI don\u2019t have a gun\u201d, as another says, \u201cI have a gun over here.\u201d  A peshmerga shouts: \u201cPlease save up your bullets.\u201d Another peshmerga fighter asks: \u201cCan we not ask for AK-47 bullets from the Americans?\u201d Lieutenant Saad, the peshmerga fighter who shot part of the footage, praised the US forces that aided the Kurds in repelling the Isis assault: \u201cIf it was not for the American firepower, we would have more casualties. They are really good fighters.\u201d  Special Warfare Operator First Class Charles H Keating IV of San Diego, who hailed from Arizona, became the third US casualty of the latest US war in Iraq.   tel osq   In the video, a US Black Hawk helicopter with medical insignia is seen descending in an open field near a US and Kurdish position outside of the town before taking off again.  While it is unclear if Keating was aboard the helicopter in the footage, a peshmerga fighter can be heard saying \u201cit has come to take away the wounded\u201d.  After consulting with the Pentagon, the Guardian has decided to blur the visible faces of US forces at Tel Osqof.  The initial description of Keating\u2019s death provided by US Central Command and the Pentagon said that he was was killed in northern Iraq \u201cas the result of enemy fire\u201d and behind the front lines.  Ashton Carter, US defense chief, described Keating\u2019s death as \u201ca combat death, of course\u201d. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, also said Keating died a combat death, but characterized the overall mission in Iraq as something short of combat.

Photograph: US Navy    \u201cOur men and women on the ground in Iraq do not have a combat mission, but they do have a dangerous mission to operate in a dangerous country,\u201d Earnest said. For years, the White House has argued that US troops in Iraq with adjuncts in Syria \u2013 officially 4,000 but often 5,500 at any given time \u2013 are an advisory force, not a combat force. Barack Obama, announcing a deployment of 250 more special-operations forces to Syria on 25 April, said: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces that continue to drive [Isis] back.\u201d Yet details of the battle at Tel Osqof, provided on Wednesday both by frontline participants and the US military command in charge of the war against Isis, suggest that the suddenness and intensity of warfare can erode the distinctions between assistance and combat.  Colonel Steve Warren, the spokesman for the command operating the war against Isis, said that Keating was part of a quick reaction force (QRF) spooled up in support of a US \u201cadvise and assist\u201d mission that \u201cjust happened to be in that village\u201d meeting with peshmerga leaders at Tel Osqof, less than four km behind the front.  From there, the US advisers fought alongside the peshmerga in a gun battle with what Warren said were at least 125 Isis fighters. \u201cOur forces automatically became embroiled in the ensuing battle,\u201d Warren said, and called in the QRF. \u201cIt was a big fight, one of the largest we\u2019ve seen recently.\u201d   Related: Kurdish fighters say US special forces have been fighting Isis for months    Warren said that the mission of QRF force Keating was a part of was not to reinforce the US fighting positions, but to extricate the Americans from the fight.  \u201cThat\u2019s why the QRF went, to help extract them. It was a big fight. They were in contact [with the enemy], they couldn\u2019t get away. So the QRF came to help ensure they were able to get away,\u201d Warren told reporters. After being wounded by small-arms fire, Keating was successfully evacuated by Black Hawk helicopter to a medical facility in Irbil, the Iraqi Kurdish capitol, but his wounds proved fatal. Warren, who called Keating an \u201cAmerican hero\u201d, said that Isis fired on the US helicopters but did not disable them.  Warren said \u201cour guys got out of there relatively rapidly\u201d but specified that the fight at Tel Osqof lasted over half a day. Thirteen US warplanes, including two drones, launched 31 airstrikes, the battle continued at least into 9.30pm, Warren said.  The Isis attack on peshmerga positions at Tel Osqof was multi-pronged and came as an apparent surprise. Before 6am on Tuesday, Isis militants bridged a peshmerga trench and crossed into territory held by the Kurdish forces.  \u201cIn the past, when they attacked, they tried to fill up the trench beyond our berms with a bulldozer, but this time was different,\u201d said a Kurdish officer, Major Ibrahim, who has fought Isis since August 2014. \u201cThere was a convoy of Isis humvees and there was a mobile bridge in a truck.\u201d      Still from the video. Photograph: The Guardian    At least 10 peshmerga were killed and up to 30 were wounded while almost all the Isis militants in the 20 vehicles that breached the front line died. Peshmerga captured at least three US-made Humvees that Isis had itself captured from the Iraqi military in 2014.  US aircraft including F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, B-52 bombers, A-10 close air support aircraft and drones launched airstrikes on more than 30 locations, destroying another 20 Isis vehicles, including a bulldozer. Warren put the Isis death toll at 58. When the Guardian visited the town on Wednesday, at least four mangled bodies were still on display in Tel Osqof. Houses with shattered windows were marked by bullet holes in their facades. Crushed packages of US ammunition littered the roads.  Dlovan Jaffar, a peshmerga fighter, took part in close combat with Isis on Tel Osqof\u2019s streets. Standing by a mangled corpse of an Isis militant on Wednesday, Jaffar said the Isis Humvees had advanced despite a hail of rocket-propelled grenades fired by the peshmerga. \u201cWe cornered three Isis militants inside a house, but then one of them blew himself up killing the other two,\u201d Jaffar said. The Americans, he said, fought outside the town, alongside elite peshmerga fighters.      Still from the video. Photograph: The Guardian    \u201cI saw an American helicopter that touched down near the entrance to the town,\u201d he said.  General Wahid Kovali, the leader of an elite peshmerga counter-terrorism unit that fought alongside the US forces, said the Seals and others fought heroically.  \u201cThey were very good fighters, but they also had good guns,\u201d said Kovali, whose forces are on the front berm across from Isis-held Iraqi territory. \u201cIt was a bad day for us here yesterday,\u201d Warren said, claiming that Isis launched the offensive to distract attention from recent territorial losses in northern Iraq.  Warren disputed that the US-led war against Isis, which will enter its third year this summer, is becoming more of a combat mission.  \u201cOur mission remains to advise, assist, train [and] equip our partner forces, both here in Iraq and in Syria. That really continues to be our primary mission,\u201d Warren said.",
