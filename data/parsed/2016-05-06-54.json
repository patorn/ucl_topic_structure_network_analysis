  "body": "Larry Elliott (Economics of Alice in Wonderland, 2 May) provides a test for Mr Cameron to do something to persuade people to support his EU stance: get Mrs Merkel and co to stop imposing more austerity on Greece \u2013 to show that the EU can equal mutual support \u2013 and we\u2019ll vote to stay. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of the EU? The clock\u2019s ticking, Dave.John BishopWolverhampton \u2022 Your leader on BHS (2 May) makes it clear that limited liability law is inadequate. In return for the privilege of limited liability, should not it be made illegal for a limited liability company to pay any dividends while the pension fund (holding employees\u2019 deferred pay) is in deficit?David BarnardCholesbury, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Does Leicester really need Leicester City\u2019s richly deserved triumph to put it on the map (Supplement, 4 May)? Aside from its other distinctions, Leicester also boasts other sporting achievement \u2013 Leicester Tigers have been rugby union champions of England 13 times (including three when a cup decided this) and twice of Europe. If rugby union\u2019s besetting sin is\u00a0smugness, football\u2019s is myopia.Huw RichardsLondon \u2022 Michael Cunningham (Letters, 6\u00a0May) mentions Leicester band Family, which reminded me of seeing them in London in 2013, when they reformed for a couple of shows. They were introduced on stage by Leicester City legend Frank Worthington.Chris SimmondsAberdeen \u2022 I had never heard of modal verbs before reading the letters page (5 May). I\u00a0went to a grammar school.Gerry MooreLondon  \u2022 Maybe the real reason for the English obsession with the Tudors (Tudormania, 4 May) is that they are among the minority of royals in English history who were actually English.Jan WiczkowskiManchester  \u2022 While it is sad to see it closing, even if\u00a0New Day had only been published for a short while (Report, 5 May), any paper without a proper letters page is always going to struggle.Keith FlettLondon  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
