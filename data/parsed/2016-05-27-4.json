  "body": "So to San Siro. When Gareth Bale walks on to the pitch on Saturday there will be something familiar about it all. Another European Cup final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for Real Madrid and back where it all began for him. For the first time Bale returns to the stadium where he scored that hat-trick against Internazionale: the prelude to another meeting in which the destruction of the defender was so complete that not only did White Hart Lane call a taxi for Maicon but he would have happily taken it, too. The prelude for an entire career, in fact. That, certainly, is how Bale sees it. Something shifted at San Siro; something started, too. \u201cWe lost in Milan,\u201d the Welshman says, easing into a chair in the small room where he takes Spanish lessons at Real Madrid\u2019s Valdebebas headquarters, \u201cbut it felt like we won and that game was the reason I wanted to play in the Champions League. It was the game that gave me the confidence to know I could play against the best. To score a hat-trick against the reigning European champions \u2026 my confidence grew, belief. And I haven\u2019t looked back from there, really.\u201d Bale has since become a European champion himself, of course. On Saturday he chases his second winners\u2019 medal. A lot has happened since the last time he was at San Siro. Bale was 21 years old, starting out; he is approaching 27 now. Twice the Premier League player of the year, the world\u2019s most expensive footballer, he has carried Wales to the European Championship and his club to titles, scoring the winner in the finals of the Copa del Rey, the Club World Cup and the Champions League. He can still see the ball loop in the air that night in Lisbon, see himself hanging there: \u201cIt happened in slow-motion. It felt like I was there for two years.\u201d He can still feel the pitch, so dry he would not have celebrated by sliding to his knees had he known; still feel his team-mates piling in too. \u201cMy head was being pulled everywhere, everyone going crazy.\u201d Can still hear the dressing room? \u201cChampagne was sprayed, the trophy was there, everyone was jumping and singing. Just \u2026\u201d Words will not really do. \u201cI just kind of had this crazy feeling you don\u2019t get: singing, chanting, happy.\u201d Bale remembers the belief and the relief. Most have tried to suggest otherwise but he says the memory of Lisbon, of Sergio Ramos\u2019s dramatic equaliser on 92.48 minutes and his goal in extra time, \u201cdefinitely plays a part\u201d on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019d rather not be 1-0 down with a minute to go,\u201d he says. But if they are, well, they have been there before. And so have Atl\u00e9tico, although he is more cautious about suggesting that \u201cscar\u201d will play on their minds. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was over but you\u2019re looking up and you see 87, and then 89, 90 \u2026 then you know it\u2019s injury time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was just praying: \u2018Please get a goal.\u2019 When we did, it just erupted.\u201d Bale then added the second, the relief greater because he had missed two good chances, which brings him to a recurring theme in this conversation: confidence, the ebb and flow of belief, his clear sense that so much of football is in the mind. He talks lucky pants, superstitions and pre-game routines, moments when confidence unexpectedly vanishes and moments when it returns, just as unexpectedly. \u201cBefore I came to Madrid maybe I would have gone into my shell and hidden,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut I kept going until the end.\u201d By the end Bale had a scarf round his head and a medal round his neck. As at San Siro in 2010 he also had the match ball up his shirt. His dad \u201crobbed\u201d the one from Milan but he still has one from the 2014 final. Now he wants another, and is approaching this final in a different frame of mind. \u201cI feel more relaxed. I suppose you\u2019ve had the experience so you know what to expect. Last time I was nervous but now I feel like I know how to deal with it. Hopefully that can improve my performance.\u201d It is not just the final, it is everything. Adapting is not always easy and Bale admits that he still struggles with the 9pm or 10pm kick-offs common in Spanish football, the usual post\u2011match climbdown taking him through the night and usually on to the internet to \u201clook at some golf stuff\u201d. Nor is the language easy still, although he is improving, and it helps that Zinedine Zidane speaks slowly. But Bale says he feels more at ease, more settled than ever. It shows, too. On a flip board in the corner are a list of Spanish verb endings. Through the doors, on the ground floor of the club\u2019s residency, a couple of Real Madrid basketballers play table tennis, near where Ramos sits chatting. Outside, staff tidy after the morning\u2019s training session. You can see Barajas airport from here and it is just a day before Madrid head that way, bound for Milan. Yet there\u2019s no sign of anxiety. Bale is relaxed and engaging, enjoyable company, open and at ease. Everything is falling into place. He is playing better than ever before, getting the recognition he was not always afforded. He admits that at times last season he felt isolated. He did not get on the ball as often as he would have liked and it is true, too, that fans had doubts. Their doubts have gone now and so, it seems, have his. \u201cI feel more a part of it now,\u201d the Welshman admits. \u201cIn the first year you don\u2019t know a lot of people but I feel more settled, more integrated, more involved.\u201d   Related: Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Diego Simeone plans to stop Real inflicting new scar | Sid Lowe    Madrid\u2019s outstanding player for much of the season, he finished on 19 league goals and 10 assists. Of those goals, nine have been headers \u2013 more than anyone in Europe, and a return, he recalls, to youth team days at centre-back. Those statistics are even more impressive since he has played only 23 league games. He averages a goal or assist every 57 minutes. Imagine if he had played all 38 games. But, then, those 23 tell a story, too: of a season punctuated by small injuries and slow recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating: I\u2019d feel I was just hitting my peak and then something would happen,\u201d Bale says. \u201cWe can\u2019t quite put our finger on why. There\u2019s no underlying reason: we\u2019ve looked into everything: the hardness of pitches, boots \u2026 I\u2019m running a lot, more than usual, so maybe it\u2019s a bit of fatigue. I need to pace myself a bit better but, when you\u2019re playing well, you just want to keep going. Sometimes I have to think I\u2019m not 19 any more, manage my body better. But injuries do just happen. [Manchester City\u2019s Vincent] Kompany, for instance. You just have to do your rehab properly and come back stronger.\u201d Bale has certainly looked stronger at the season\u2019s close and it may be that earlier absences benefit him now. At times he appears on a different physical plane; faster, taller and stronger than anyone else. Faster, taller and stronger than he used to be, too. At the start of the season photos appeared, like \u201cBefore\u201d and \u201cAfter\u201d shots from a body-building magazine. \u201cBut I never do any gym work,\u201d he protests. \u201cNo weights, never. I work on my core but my body\u2019s natural. Someone showed me the photo and I was like: \u2018I honestly did nothing in the summer.\u2019 And my friend said: \u2018Play on it. Say you\u2019ve been in the gym.\u2019 \u2018But I haven\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018But it sounds good.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, but it\u2019s lying.\u2019 \u201cAnd I know that somewhere down the line I\u2019ll say: \u2018No, I didn\u2019t go to the gym.\u2019 Maybe I matured, filled out a bit.\u201d He has changed, that is for sure. Bale screws up his body to \u201cbecome\u201d the scrawny, skinny 16-year-old who made his debut for Wales. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 years,\u201d he says, barely able to believe it. \u201cI feel a lot different. I\u2019ve obviously grown in every direction.\u201d Even then he was fast; at 14 he could run 100 metres in 11 seconds. So how fast can he run it now? \u201cI\u2019ve actually never done it since I left school \u2026 and I don\u2019t really want to in case I pull a hamstring or something,\u201d he laughs. It does not take a stopwatch to conclude that the answer is still: faster than just about everyone else. He can feel it, too. There are still \u201cMaicon moments\u201d, and many of them: \u201cCertain games where you think: \u2018This guy, I\u2019ve got his number.\u2019 But if I\u2019m 100% fit and confident, I feel like I can go past anyone, one on one, especially if I have space: if I\u2019m able to just knock it and run, I\u2019m quicker than most.\u201d It is a glimpse of the weaknesses he seeks out but he has sought others, too. Bale talks about adapting to a new country, a new culture and a new game, about the need for something other than speed, about getting found out and that difficult, trophy-less second season. \u201cBad\u201d is his blunt assessment. He talks about that and about how learning the hard way brought him here. If everything started at San Siro six years ago, it has not always been a smooth ride back to there. \u201cThe Premier League is end to end; here teams come and sit and you have to learn a different style,\u201d he explains. \u201cI feel like that first season everyone didn\u2019t know fully what I was about so I could do the same thing as in England. Then they knew what I was about and tried to nullify what I do well. I found it more difficult but I\u2019m so happy that season did happen because I learnt a lot: about keeping the ball, movement, intelligence, decision\u2011making. It\u2019s because of that bad season that I think I\u2019ve had such a good season now. I\u2019ve improved, I have more variety in my game.\u201d Denying Bale space is no longer enough. \u201cI feel like now, if Atl\u00e9tico play defensively, I\u2019m much more comfortable than I would have been. Last year made me re-evaluate \u2026 well, maybe not re-evaluate but learn. When you\u2019re good at something, people try to stop it and you need to find another way. It was similar to when I broke [through] against Inter: people started double marking me. I had to come inside, do things differently, figure out ways around it. [At Madrid] things improve when you start to build better relationships; you play better, adapt. It took me a bit longer than I would have liked but I\u2019ve become a better player for having that bad season.\u201d Although Bale was among the few players disappointed at Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s sacking in January, Real have improved under Zidane: they reached the Champions League final and finished the league season with 12 consecutive victories. Tactically, there have not been huge changes, although Bale underlines the importance of Carlos Casemiro in deep midfield. \u201cOur Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 \u2026 he literally tackles everything that moves, even if it\u2019s the referee.\u201d It has been more about the atmosphere, confidence. Bale has enjoyed the freedom to come in from the right and the quiet approachability of the Frenchman. Quiet, calm, Zidane could hardly be more different from his manager at Tottenham, Harry Redknapp, and yet Bale does see similarities. \u201cThey\u2019re not so different in [that] they both want you to express yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that way they\u2019re very similar. I was speaking to Luka [Modric] about this: at Tottenham he [Redknapp] used to say get the ball to me, Luka, Rafa [van der Vaart], Aaron [Lennon], and just go at teams, enjoy it. I suppose it\u2019s similar here: we like to attack. He [Zidane] likes us to roam, to have freedom. Ultimately that makes you feel better.\u201d Not that they are without responsibilities; Zidane has insisted on the need for every player to fulfil his defensive duties, and after the cl\u00e1sico Bale admitted they had waited for the chance to break from deep, noting that Zidane has given them \u201cpatience\u201d to do so, and insists the Champions League semi-final victory against Manchester City was \u201cnot dull and boring to us\u201d but a case of control. Diego Simeone, meanwhile, says he expects Real to play on the counterattack in Milan. So, will they? \u201cThat depends how they set up,\u201d Bale says. \u201cGames against Atl\u00e9tico are always very physical. They\u2019re very defensive and make it very difficult to break them down. It is about taking our opportunities because they\u2019re not going to give us a lot. If they attack us, we can defend and hit on the counter; if they don\u2019t attack, we can\u2019t counter. But we have a few gameplans. We can keep the ball, counterattack, defend. When the game comes, plans sometimes go out of the window, though. \u201cI feel we\u2019re hitting our peak and playing very well at the moment. It\u2019s amazing to be in another final; that\u2019s what I came here for and we\u2019re all looking forward to it.\u201d There is just one problem: \u201cWe don\u2019t actually have a lot of tickets,\u201d Bale says with a smile. \u201cBut my friends are going, my family too. So long as they are there.\u201d San Siro, again. Back where it all started.",
