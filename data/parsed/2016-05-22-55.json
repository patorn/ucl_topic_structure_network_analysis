  "body": "Conor McGregor has spoken at length about his \u201cpublicized civil war\u201d with UFC in a lengthy interview with ESPN.  The disagreement between UFC and its biggest star came in April when McGregor announced his retirement on Twitter. McGregor believed that his publicity duties ahead of UFC 200 were getting in the way of his training schedule. McGregor was due to fight Nate Diaz, who he had lost to at UFC 196.  \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, [the retirement announcement on Twitter] blew up,\u201d McGregor told ESPN. \u201cI was kind of having fun to start, half-hearted. Then all of a sudden it\u2019s, \u2018you\u2019re off 200!\u2019 I was like, \u2018alright, well fuck you too, then.\u2019 \u201cAll said and done, there were times [I thought], \u2018I should have just jumped on the damn flight [and done the publicity tour].\u2019 But sometimes you\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right for you and not what\u2019s right for everybody else, especially if you\u2019ve done what\u2019s right for everyone else a million times over.\u201d McGregor has since rowed back on his retirement announcement and said he has held talks with the UFC president, Dana White. He added that his relationship with the organization is \u201cgood\u201d.   Related: Will Conor McGregor's absence hurt UFC 200? It's debatable    \u201cI\u2019m committed to the fight game,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI enjoy competition. I enjoy challenges. If a challenge is in front of me and it appeals to me, I will go ahead and conquer it. \u201cDid I do all the media? Did I dance like a monkey? No. Am I still here? Am I still fighting? Am I still collecting? Yeah. So, [UFC] saved face, I saved face \u2013 there was no loser. We all won in a way. I had them realistically, but they couldn\u2019t bow down, so there was no loser. I was over here, they were there and now we\u2019re in the middle. We\u2019re in a good spot.\u201d McGregor added that his reluctance to go on the publicity tour in April had been influenced by the death of MMA fighter Joao Carvalho at a fight in Ireland. Carvalho\u2019s death came a week before his retirement tweet and McGregor said the death had affected him. \u201cI had fucking journalists knocking down my mother\u2019s door, you know what I mean?\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I signed up to do \u2013 have people knocking on my mother\u2019s door, talking about a kid dying. It\u2019s not nice to see a kid die like that. It does something to you. And there\u2019s been show after show canceled in Ireland since that. It\u2019s fucked up to be a part of it, and I didn\u2019t want to bring it back up and put it more on a public scale. \u201cAfter all that, I did not want to be put in front of a camera and made to dance. I just wasn\u2019t feeling it.\u201d In the ESPN interview McGregor also dismissed rumors of a fight with retired boxing legend Floyd Mayweather, saying the sums involved were beneath him.  \u201cI hear [Mayweather] talking. The leak came out, it was him that leaked the rumor and it said he gets $100m and I get $7m \u2013 that\u2019s a pay cut to me. I don\u2019t take pay cuts. I thought boxing was where the money was at. The $7m is absolutely laughable. He\u2019s talking $100m \u2013 I\u2019m also talking $100m,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI\u2019m 27 years of age and I\u2019m just about halfway through a $100m contract. At 27 years of age, Floyd Mayweather was on Oscar De La Hoya\u2019s undercard. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to conquer both worlds? He\u2019s getting old now. He needs me, I don\u2019t need him. Who else can he fight?\u201d",
