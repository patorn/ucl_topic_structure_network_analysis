  "body": "A new Star Wars book will attempt to explain away Carrie Fisher\u2019s shifting accent as Princess Leia and reimagine the gold \u201cslave\u201d bikini she was forced to wear in 1983\u2019s Return of the Jedi as a symbol of empowerment, according to its author. Claudia Gray told Entertainment Weekly that her book, Star Wars: Bloodline, would address a number of complaints surrounding Leia\u2019s depiction in the original Star Wars trilogy, including the lack of resolution following her discovery that she is Darth Vader\u2019s daughter.   Related: Carrie Fisher blasts Star Wars body shamers    Leia\u2019s accent shuffles from a plummy English delivery (in her early encounter with Peter Cushing\u2019s Grand Moff Tarkin) to her usual Californian tones over the course of 1977\u2019s Star Wars, a fact Fisher has referenced in interviews. Gray said she decided to fix the anomaly once and for all. \u201c[In interviews] she sort of laughs at her younger self for being so influenced by Peter Cushing,\u201d noted the author. \u201cBut I thought: I\u2019m gonna use that. So there\u2019s an explanation in the book that she\u2019s actually making fun of Tarkin. She\u2019s mocking his accent in that moment. She remembers that\u2019s what she was doing. So that moment has been explained. It\u2019s no longer a problem.\u201d Gray also said she wanted to reconfigure Leia\u2019s encounter with Jabba the Hutt in Return of the Jedi to focus on the princess\u2019s bravery, rather than her skimpy attire. Bloodline reveals the one-time Rebel Alliance leader has been given the title of \u201cThe Huttslayer\u201d for her heroism in killing the slug-like alien gangster. \u201cRight around when I was working on this part of the book there was a movement that went around in some Star Wars fan circles \u2013 a lot of talk about how much people don\u2019t like the \u2018Slave Leia\u2019 outfit,\u201d said Gray. \u201cThat\u2019s her most powerless moment in the entire thing \u2026  \u201cI believe it was a young lady named Angie P, who said, \u2018I petition that we call it The Huttslayer outfit,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018That is a great name and that is going to happen right now\u2019.\u201d Continued Gray: \u201cNot only did I like recasting that outfit as a memory of Leia being really strong and kickass, but think about it \u2013 for a human being to kill a Hutt with her bare hands? That\u2019s unbelievable. Anybody who would be able to pull that off would be remembered for it. That would be legend.\u201d The author also said she felt it was vital to examine Leia\u2019s feelings towards her father Darth Vader in the aftermath of Return of the Jedi. \u201cThat was one of the things I wanted to delve into the most,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see so little of Leia\u2019s reaction to this knowledge in the movies. We see her find out right before the Battle of Endor, she\u2019s clearly very upset. But they have a war to fight.  \u201cYou see Luke struggle with this, be tempted to darkness, and he gets to see his father leave darkness behind. But these are not experiences Leia got to have \u2013 and if anything she suffered more from Vader than Luke did. I really wanted to delve into: how much at peace is she with this? How conflicted is she? What does she think about when she thinks about the times she encountered Vader?\u201d In other Star Wars news, Independent.ie has published photography purporting to reveal Luke Skywalker\u2019s Jedi Temple being built on the island of Skellig Michael off the coast of Ireland. The religious building is expected to feature in Rian Johnson\u2019s upcoming Star Wars: Episode VIII, which is currently filming.
