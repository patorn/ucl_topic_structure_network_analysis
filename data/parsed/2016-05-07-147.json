It\u2019s a large, white canvas from 1973, divided into blocks of multicoloured stripes that resemble barcodes. Ottavio\u2019s son, Luca, the artistic director of the Missoni archive and co-curator of the show at London\u2019s Fashion and Textile Museum, isn\u2019t sure which way it should be hung. His father, who died in 2013, recalled the stripes running horizontally across the canvas, but after much discussion, Ottavio reportedly said: \u201cI don\u2019t care which way you hang it, Luca. Just don\u2019t ask me again.\u201d This says much about the creative, free-spirited family: inspired by the art world, Ottavio and Rosita went on to build a distinctive, irreverent brand that, half a century later, still turns heads in the fashion and design world. Missoni\u2019s much-imitated signature look is the multicoloured zigzag \u2013 a technique Rosita\u2019s grandparents applied when making intricately embroidered, fringed shawls at their factory, T&J Vestor, which still operates today.     Senza Titolo, 1973, by Ottavio Missoni. Photograph: Missoni Press Office    When the Missonis incorporated this into their knitwear collections, fashion editors took note. By the 70s, Missoni had become an internationally renowned fashion house: \u201cWe codified our style,\u201d says Rosita Missoni, now 84. \u201cWe had discovered the pleasure of mixing patterns.\u201d   Related: Stripes and zigzags: fashion brand Missoni's links to modern art    In 1983, the Missoni label became one of the first brands to expand its range from the catwalk into the home. Their signature pattern appeared on everything from candles to pouffes. In the late 90s, after more than 40 years at the head of the women\u2019s fashion collection, Rosita retired \u2013 only to return two months later to run the homes division, handing responsibility for womenswear to her daughter, Angela. \u201cIt was a good commercial collection,\u201d says Rosita of homewares, \u201cbut it could have been more creative, so I thought I would take care of it.\u201d The exhibition, which opens this weekend, arrives from the Maga Museum in Gallarate, northern Italy, an institution the Missonis would have visited in the 1950s when, just married, they bought a small apartment in the city and installed four knitting machines in the basement. The retrospective has been conceived as an immersive experience: Ottavio\u2019s private patchworks, made for his own home, hang in the space and in the final section of the show, visitors can recline on Missoni furniture to watch a short film about the glamorous founders of Italy\u2019s iconic fashion house. \u201cBecause mostly, the show is the story of our lifestyle, our lifetime,\u201d says Rosita.     Ottavio Missoni\u2019s private patchworks hang above the furniture for an immersive experience. Photograph: Max Zambelli/Missoni press office    Today the Missoni homewares range incorporates ceramics, linens, rugs, cushions, throws, footstools, towels, lighting and outdoor fabrics and furnishings in the unmistakable, patterns and colourways of their fashion fabrics. \u201cTheir designs are instantly recognisable,\u201d says Celia Joicey, director of the Fashion and Textile Museum. \u201cAnd the fact they have managed to diversify, keep their identity and last so long \u2013 where so many other brands have lost their way \u2013 there are lessons to take from that.\u201d Soon after Rosita\u2019s homewares relaunch, \u201clittle by little\u201d she recalls Missoni-esque imitations appearing. \u201cCopies for me are always a compliment,\u201d she says, magnanimously. \u201cIt means you have something to say. And, of course, it makes you step onwards.\u201d This year\u2019s homewares range introduces six new prints that are rooted in the iconic patterns and signature colourways of the Missoni brand. Among them, a print from a 1970s silk dress that Rosita came across in her research for the Maga retrospective, which has been reclaimed from the catwalk and embroidered across luxury sateen cushions. Asked how Missoni continues to thrive against a never-ending trend for neutral interiors, Rosita says it\u2019s all in the technique. \u201cI always start with black or white as a base, and work from there. It\u2019s not just a case of putting pattern on pattern: it\u2019s a skill, a judgment one has to be very sure of. But, by now, I think I know how to play it.\u201d \u2022 Missoni Art Colour runs until 4 September at the Fashion and Textile Museum, London SE1 (ftmlondon.org) and is sponsored by Woolmark.",
