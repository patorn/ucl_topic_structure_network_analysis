  "body": "\u201cI was dead,\u201d Kieren Fallon says, and he\u2019s right. He was. Last autumn, the six-times British champion jockey was kicking around the backstretch on some of America\u2019s more flyblown racetracks, riding the occasional no-hoper and looking increasingly like that pulp-fiction staple, the washed-up ex-champ who should have got out when he could. Seven months later, he is very much alive. A fell runner would not expect as many ups and downs in one career as Fallon has enjoyed and endured, but then he has always been the survivor\u2019s survivor. Fallon\u2019s title-winning days are surely behind him, but when it comes to the Classics, he can still look forward and not back.

The easy winner of the 1,000 Guineas Trial at Leopardstown earlier this month is expected to provide the sternest opposition to Minding, the winner of the Guineas at Newmarket, as she attempts to complete a Classic double. For Fallon, meanwhile, a victory on Sunday would be his 23rd in British and Irish Classics alone. \u201cI had one foot in the grave as regards racing [last year],\u201d Fallon said this week, during a brief visit to Ayr to ride a 15-1 double. \u201cI got a new lease of life going back to work for Michael. He\u2019s ambitious and he\u2019s hungry and sharp, and to see that again, I\u2019d feel disappointed in myself if I couldn\u2019t bring one little thing. Hopefully this year, that thing will be a Guineas winner.   Related: Kieren Fallon: I come from nothing so everything I ever got was a bonus    \u201cI\u2019ve always liked her. When I went over in the spring, she gave me the feel of a Guineas filly. Michael is a very patient trainer and we knew she was going to improve, and she has. Whether she will be up to beating Minding, we won\u2019t know until the day, but we go there with a lot of confidence.\u201d Fallon said at Chester recently that the medical for his licence to join O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s stable was the latest turning point in his career. \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better now than I did last year,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great doctor in Ireland, and he\u2019s sorted me out.\u201d The result is plain. Physically, Fallon looks as lean, taut and strong as always, but there is a distinct sense of eagerness and confidence about him too. He has always been a difficult jockey to beat. Now, though, his edge owes less to raw power than it does to instinct and experience, and Fallon can draw on deep reserves of both. \u201cI\u2019m only doing a job, and it\u2019s no different to any of the jobs I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Fallon says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ride any different, if I\u2019ve got the ammunition, I\u2019m going to use it as best I can. I\u2019ve been lucky enough over the years. Usually, one has come along, and luckily, this one has come along. \u201cFillies are a little bit different to colts, I find. I\u2019ve been more successful with fillies over the years than colts, and I\u2019ve ridden some great fillies like Bosra Sham, Ouija Board, Alexandrova, the list goes on. \u201cAidan [O\u2019Brien] has got a serious filly in Minding. Now Or Never is as good as any Guineas filly I\u2019ve ridden before, but this could be an exceptional year.\u201d Win or lose, Fallon insists that he is back in Europe for the foreseeable future, and will enjoy every moment of the latest chapter in one of the great riding careers.

I love to see that. \u201cIt\u2019s their big day as well. I\u2019ve had many big days over the years, thank God. For the lads, this could be their first big day and they might not have another one again.\u201d Fallon has spent three decades attracting triumph and trouble in roughly equal proportion, and his extraordinary journey through the sport of kings has always seemed odds-on to end in a valley rather than a peak. But he is clearly getting more from life as a jockey this spring than he has for a very long time. Fallon, as always, has been through tough times and emerged on the other side, riding a horse with a serious chance in one of the season\u2019s biggest races. Even if the strength of his youth is beginning to fade, the desire and hunger remain. \u201cI rode around Killarney last night,\u201d he says. \u201cFourteen or 15 runners around there, and I got a real buzz out of it. We were having a laugh, even though we were killing each other, and it gives you a new lease of life and it means you appreciate the good times. Going around there, it\u2019s tough, but if you don\u2019t join in and get into the mix, you\u2019re going to end up on the muck heap. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done before doesn\u2019t count for anything. It\u2019s even worse than that, because it means you want to get back there even more.\u201d",
