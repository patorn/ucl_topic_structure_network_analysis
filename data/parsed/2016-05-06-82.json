After a night of unexpected twists and defeats for all parties, the Scottish National party fell two seats short of the overall majority that the polls had predicted and that its leader had craved.  The SNP\u2019s third successive election victory left Sturgeon with 63 seats, meaning she will need to seek short-term deals with other parties to push through her policies and, crucially, Holyrood budgets. Scottish Labour endured its worst election result in more than a century, beaten into third place with 24 seats. The Scottish Tories became Holyrood\u2019s official opposition after winning 31 seats, more than doubling their 2011 tally.  Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, won the constituency seat of Edinburgh Central, and her party\u2019s share of the vote rose by 10 points following a campaign focusing heavily on Davidson\u2019s claim that she would be the SNP\u2019s most vigorous opponent.

Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA    Davidson called on Sturgeon to categorically rule out an independence referendum in the new parliament. \u201cNow she has failed to win a majority, whatever claims the SNP were pursuing with regard to constitutional brinkmanship over the next five years have now been utterly shredded. No mandate, no majority, no cause \u2013 the SNP must now let Scotland move on,\u201d she said. Sturgeon said she had won \u201ca clear and unequivocal mandate\u201d as first minister, and said her large group of MSPs made it unnecessary to seek formal alliances with other parties. Sturgeon was deputy first minister in Alex Salmond\u2019s first minority government from 2007 to 2011, which survived by striking short-term tactical deals, chiefly with the Conservatives. \u201cHowever, the government I lead will be an inclusive government,\u201d Sturgeon added. \u201cIt will be firm on our determination to deliver on the commitments we made to the Scottish people but it will also reach out to others across the parliament to find common ground and build consensus.\u201d   Related: Holyrood elections see rise of 'Team Ruth' and demise of Labour vision    Scottish Labour\u2019s leader, Kezia Dugdale, said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d at her party\u2019s poor performance but said she would not resign. Labour lost 13 seats overall and won in only three constituencies, down from 15 in 2011.  Dugdale said she took full responsibility for the result, but also said voters had been put off by Labour\u2019s internal divisions under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership.  Party sources said the antisemitism row involving the former London mayor Ken Livingstone had cut their support by five points. \u201cIt\u2019s quite apparent that when people saw a divided Labour party across the country, it wasn\u2019t particularly appealing in terms of getting people\u2019s votes,\u201d Dugdale told BBC News. \u201cSo I would appeal to the Labour party the length and breadth of the country to unite behind our ideals, our values and our principles, and focus on the future.\u201d Her ally Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary and Labour\u2019s sole MP in Scotland, questioned Corbyn\u2019s leadership in an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One. \u201cI don\u2019t think the public see the UK Labour party led by Jeremy Corbyn at the moment as being a credible party of future government in 2020,\u201d he said.

Both the SNP and Labour missed out on considerable numbers of votes in the regional list vote, raising doubts about their overall appeal and election strategies. The SNP\u2019s regional vote was five points lower than its constituency vote, as its supporters lent backing to the more radical and leftwing Scottish Green party. More than 78,000 of the 514,000 people who gave Labour their constituency votes switched their list vote to other parties. Deals with the pro-independence Scottish Greens, which took six seats to become Holyrood\u2019s fourth largest party, would give Sturgeon a secure majority. But the Greens are expected to insist the SNP introduces tougher taxes on higher earners in return for its backing, something Sturgeon is likely to resist to avoid alienating centre-ground voters. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens\u2019 co-convener, said it was too early to set out a precise list of demands to put to Sturgeon if she asked for parliamentary support, but confirmed that progressive taxation at national and local level was a priority.  Harvie said that would become a significant issue when Sturgeon needed a majority to push through her next budget. \u201cThe case for progressive taxation is strong, and they\u2019re going to require support to get their budget through,\u201d he said.

Not any more | Lesley Riddoch    David Cameron, who played no part in the Scottish Conservative campaign, hailed Davidson\u2019s victory as a realignment of Scottish politics. He said he would not have believed that the party\u2019s fortunes could be transformed so dramatically within six years of him becoming prime minister. \u201cThat is what has happened and that is what is so extraordinary for our party,\u201d he said. In contrast, Scottish Labour\u2019s disastrous showing marred a relatively good set of election results in other parts of the UK for Jeremy Corbyn, the UK Labour leader, who made only a handful of campaign appearances in Scotland.  Corbyn said Dugdale had fought with \u201cdetermination\u201d, but acknowledged that the Scottish party faced a great deal of rebuilding. \u201cWe are going to be with you. We are going to walk hand in hand with the party in Scotland to build that support up once again so that the Labour tradition in Scotland will be established once again,\u201d Corbyn said. Despite the scale of Dugdale\u2019s defeat, there was no sign of open rebellion against her leadership. But there were demands from her deputy, Alex Rowley, for her to reopen the debate within the party on Scotland\u2019s constitutional relationship with the rest of the UK to help win back pro-independence former Labour supporters who now voted SNP. Rowley said the party had to produce \u201ca clear vision for the future of Scotland\u201d and needed to revisit the question of \u201chome rule\u201d for Scotland, or federalism at UK level, to give Holyrood full control over tax-raising powers and areas such as pensions or employment law.",
