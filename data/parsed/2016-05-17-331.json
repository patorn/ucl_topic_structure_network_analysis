  "body": "The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has endorsed US Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying Trump would be \u201cvery difficult to deal with.\u201d He criticised the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, for calling for Australia to rethink its foreign policy, independent of the United States. \u201cWe will stick to the American alliance full stop,\u201d Shorten said on Tuesday. \u201cThe Labor party sees as part of our foreign policy the strong ongoing maintenance of the American alliance.\u201d   Related: Richard Di Natale: global warming is the most urgent threat to Australia's security    Di Natale spoke at the Lowy Institute on Tuesday, and told its audience that if Australia wanted to be a \u201cconfident and courageous country\u201d it must forge a more independent path in the region, free of the entanglements of the US alliance. He said Australia\u2019s tight-knit alliance with the US had made the country more prone to threat than if it was unaligned. By failing to pursue an independent foreign policy \u201cwe renounce our ambition to be a confident 21st century country and undermine our own national interests\u201d, he said. Shorten criticised that argument on Tuesday, dismissing it as another \u201csilly\u201d Greens idea. He then risked inserting himself into the US political debate by saying he knew who he would vote for in the upcoming presidential election if he had the chance. \u201cI have to say that if I was in America I would be voting for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cWhoever America elect we\u2019ll work with, but there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Trump would be very difficult, I think, to deal with.\u201d Former prime minister John Howard was heavily criticised in 2007 when he warned that the election of then-US Democratic presidential aspirant Barack Obama would be a boost for terrorists in Iraq. \u201cIf I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq, I would put a circle around March 2008, and pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats,\u201d Howard said at the time. Obama said the attack from Howard was a \u201cjust a bunch of empty rhetoric\u201d unless Australia put more troops on the ground in Iraq.   Related: Bill Shorten: caught between the Tele and the deep Greens sea | Lenore Taylor    Shorten also criticised Malcolm Turnbull for his decision to delay the start date of its so-called backpackers tax by six months, which puts it off until well after the election. Labor has said it wants to scrap the tax but won\u2019t commit to doing so until it sees modelling of the true amount of revenue that would be forgone. It says the measure cannot raise $540m because the tax is deterring holidaymakers from coming to Australia. \u201cThe budget was barely two weeks ago and the wheels are falling off it. What a shemozzle,\u201d Shorten said. On Tuesday the assistant treasurer, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, announced the government would delay the backpacker tax for six months until 1 January 2017. The delay would cost $40m, she said.",
