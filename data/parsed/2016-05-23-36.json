  "body": "\u2022 An editing error in an article about health spending led to a claim that the NHS in England had run up a record deficit of \u00a32.45bn in the last financial year. The deficit is not for the whole of\u00a0the NHS in England, but NHS trusts, which predominantly run hospitals (NHS incurs record \u00a32.45bn deficit in England as demand outstrips funds, 21\u00a0May, page 10). \u2022 Cliveden, the National Trust property formerly owned by the Astor family, is in Buckinghamshire, not Berkshire, and it was the second Duke of Buckingham, not the first, who acquired the estate in the 17th century and fought a duel with his mistress\u2019s husband. We also had the date of the duel wrong: it took place in 1668, not 1688 (Chamber music: giant amp filled Cliveden with sound, 19\u00a0May,\u00a0page 13). \u2022 The clue for 17 across in last Thursday\u2019s quick crossword (No 14,361, page 24, G2), \u201cAnnual London dog show\u201d, did not tally with the solution, \u201cCrufts\u201d. While the dog show was formerly held in London, since 1991 it has been held at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: NHS chief says Brexit would be dangerous for health service Why isn\u2019t there a Grindr for straight people?",
