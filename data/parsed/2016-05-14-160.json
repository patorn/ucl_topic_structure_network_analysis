  "body": "Andy Mulligan\u2019s four-part play School Drama (Wednesday to 21 May, 2.15pm, Radio 4) stars Tom Hollander as has-been TV actor Geoff Cathcart, who\u2019s brought in to organise a production of Romeo And Juliet in a failing school. The school has been rebranded by a sponsor who is keen to raise its profile by entering it into a drama festival. The teachers aren\u2019t sure the kids are up to the play. And the prospect of swordplay in the hall is obviously anathema to the health and safety culture. In John Dryden\u2019s production, the parallels between the hothouse of a modern school and Renaissance Verona can be sensed amid the clanging lockers, crackling intercoms and incipient chaos of corridor life.   We experience the school through the eyes of outsider Geoff. \u201cYou spend more money on security systems than you do on books,\u201d he fumes rather high-handedly when he doesn\u2019t get his way. It\u2019s a fair point. To embed just a few lines of Shakespeare\u2019s verse in a 15-year-old mind in the hope that at some point in the future it may detonate is still surely one of the noblest purposes of education.  Scritti Politti\u2019s Green Gartside sits in for Tom Robinson (Saturday, 9pm, 6 Music). Most musicians-turned-DJs have surprisingly little to say about music. They tend to use most of their energies in making it clear that they\u2019re in favour of the right stuff and against the wrong stuff. Gartside isn\u2019t like that. He talks about what music sounds like and how it works, rather than what it allegedly stands for. The guest on Johnnie Walker\u2019s Sounds Of The 70s (Sunday, 3pm, Radio 2) is another veteran sharing the same initials. The always interesting Graham Gouldman is best known for his work with 10cc but got his start as a jobbing songwriter in the 60s. On more than one occasion the ideas for those songs came from his father, who was the kind of person who noticed things like the sign in a window saying \u201cno milk today\u201d and wondered whether this might hint at hidden heartbreak.  The estimable Martin Kelner is back on TalkSport once a week, adding his quizzical northern top notes to the symphony of banter that is the Colin Murray show (Tuesday, 10am, TalkSport). The guest on Let\u2019s Talk With Eamonn Holmes (Sunday, 11am, TalkRadio) is Christopher Biggins, talking about the experiences of being bankrupt and being a gay man married to a woman.   St Helena \u2013 Joining The Rest Of Us (Friday, 11am, Radio 4) is the first of two programmes devoted to the tiny island in the south Atlantic where Napoleon ended his days. It\u2019s presented by vet Joe Hollins, who has been recording the life of the community for the last six months. Here the opening of a new airport promises to bring tourism and a long overdue sense of connection to the rest of the world. Before that the only way was a boat from South Africa. It was 2,000 miles away",
