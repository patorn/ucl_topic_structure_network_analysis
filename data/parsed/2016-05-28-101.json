Songs, movies, books, food: We\u2019re hardwired for specific quantities of pleasure, and once the amount is exceeded, good goes bad,\u201d teenage Hannah Dexter explains in Robin Wasserman\u2019s new novel Girls on Fire. \u201cVery rarely, Lacey said, you find something for which your brain has infinite capacity, and that, Lacey said, is the thing we call love.\u201d Lacey Champlain is the new girl in Battle Creek, the rural Pennsylvania town where Hannah has spent her entire life. The high school they both attend is still in shock following their popular classmate Craig Ellison\u2019s apparent suicide. Lacey becomes more than just Hannah\u2019s best and only friend: She\u2019s her guru, preaching ideas that Hannah sometimes misunderstands but always absorbs. Now that they\u2019ve found each other, the thing Lacey calls love isn\u2019t just an abstract concept for the girls. It also seems to describe her connection to Hannah.  Stop me if this is beginning to sound familiar. It\u2019s fair to say, now that it is inspiring articles and thinkpieces, that the \u201cgirl\u201d book has become a genre of its own. Inspired by Gillian Flynn\u2019s 2012 blockbuster Gone Girl, a whole host of novels have set themselves up as explorations of or elaborations on certain feminine stereotypes. These novels take the shape of thrillers, but their animating mission is to question.   Related: The Gone Girl backlash: what women don\u2019t want    In Flynn\u2019s novel, the trope to be questioned was the Cool Girl. Gone Girl\u2019s twisted narrator Amy defined a Cool Girl as \u201ca hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she\u2019s hosting the world\u2019s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2.\u201d The Cool Girl exists to fulfill men\u2019s fantasies, and Amy sees herself as this woman\u2019s antithesis: one particular man\u2019s worst nightmare.  The trope \u2013 and this passage in the Flynn novel \u2013 has proved enduring, more so than is typical for a commercial bestseller. The Cool Girl seems tailor-made for an era when women\u2019s media and social media hashtag campaigns leave no sexist stereotype unquestioned. Her invention is a work of feminist criticism within a work of fiction, and has itself inspired endless feminist criticism. What is more interesting about Wasserman\u2019s novel is how she attacks two other long-established archetypes: the good girl and the bad girl. Wasserman believes the two depend on each other for sustenance. The bad girl is a stock character so ancient that tracing its origins is both impossible and unnecessary, but Euripides\u2019 Medea is the quintessential early example. It\u2019s vengeance, not evil, that drives Medea to murder her own children and romantic rival after her husband Jason\u2019s betrayal. Her crime is a refusal to quietly endure the consequences of Jason\u2019s cruelty. Bad girls aren\u2019t villains; they\u2019re transgressive forces within patriarchal cultures. Made to choose between wreaking destruction and accepting their own powerlessness, they pick destruction. Classic literature often pairs bad girls with good girls \u2013 who are not always kindhearted, but do adhere to society\u2019s rules for women. The bad girl tends to serve a dual function in these stories, as a cautionary tale and an obstacle the good girl must clear to obtain the object of her affection. Mad Bertha\u2019s fiery suicide frees up Rochester to marry Jane Eyre. Scandal-stricken Countess Olenska in Edith Wharton\u2019s The Age of Innocence cedes her beloved Newland Archer to her proper cousin May Welland, but not without some manipulation on May\u2019s part. The bad girl either dies or fades into the background in the end, and the good girl lives happily (or boringly) ever after. From Vanity Fair to Gossip Girl, friendships between good girls and bad girls are by no means rare, either. In Thackeray\u2019s satirical novel, scheming social climber Becky Sharp attaches herself to \u2013 and sometimes plays architect to the life of \u2013 rich, dull Amelia Sedley. Cecily von Ziegesar\u2019s Gossip Girl series takes a page from Wharton, pairing up effortlessly heartbreaking bad girl Serena van der Woodson and Blair Waldorf, a high-achieving good girl who is also a power-hungry mean girl. Lacey and Hannah\u2019s friendship first takes the broad shape of a romance. Furtive glances across the classroom lead up to a fateful meeting in the nurse\u2019s office. After an episode of gym-class humiliation straight out of Carrie, a teary and blood-stained Hannah observes that pale, dark-haired Lacey smells \u201clike Christmas, ginger and cloves\u201d and worries she\u2019ll lose her interest with a single dim comment. They cement their connection with all-night drives across state lines. Lacey rechristens her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u201cDex\u201d and intoxicates her with drugs, boys, rock shows, and Satanic rituals. (\u201cDex\u201d can\u2019t quite discern how sincere Lacey is about the latter.)  So far, their story hews close to the standard good-girl-meets-bad-girl narrative \u2013 with Wasserman interrupting the characters\u2019 accelerated journey to intimacy, every few pages, to plant some alarming omen. But unlike so many classic examples of the trope, Girls on Fire isn\u2019t a social procedural. Its primary concern isn\u2019t how a good girl\u2019s fate might come to be entwined with a bad girl\u2019s. By instead asking why, it calls attention to rarely discussed attributes of both character types. Bad girls like Dangerous Liaisons\u2019 Marquise de Merteuil unconsciously set themselves up to fail, ignoring possible paths to happiness in the course of single-mindedly following impossible ones. For good girls \u2013 Dangerous Liaisons has Madame de Tourvel and C\u00e9cile de Volanges \u2013 virtue tends to mask some blankness or hollowness at their very core. When they\u2019re not looking to a man for purpose, they\u2019re looking to a bad girl to supply them with a personality.  Then comes the inevitable girl-loses-girl moment, after Hannah\u2019s naivety prevents her from fully comprehending how vulnerable Lacey is at home. Lacey leaves her friend to fend for herself at a party hurtling toward drunken chaos. It\u2019s uncommon for a good girl to be tested this way \u2013 to find herself in a tense situation without a bad girl to navigate her towards safety or danger, to have to make the choice herself.  \u201cLacey had told me of quantum incompatibilities, qualities so opposed to each other that the very existence of one eliminated the possibility of the other,\u201d Hannah recounts in one early, lyrical passage.  I could recognize Lacey\u2019s presence in my bedroom as its ultimate illustration, Lacey\u2019s combat boots crushing my turquoise shag carpeting, her eyes alighting briefly on the stuffed turtle I still kept tucked between my pillows, Hannah Dexter\u2019s past and future in a doomed collision, matter and antimatter collapsing into a black hole that would consume us both. Translation: I was pretty sure that once Lacey saw me in my natural habitat, she would disappear.  Hannah has a knack for making false assumptions, and she\u2019s dead wrong here. Lacey isn\u2019t antimatter. She doesn\u2019t disappear. The bad girl happily acclimates to the good girl\u2019s environment. Later, the good girl will have an opportunity to permanently relocate to the bad girl\u2019s domain. It\u2019s essential and rare that the decision is hers to make, just like it was at the party. Literature\u2019s bad girls have \u2013 or seize \u2013 the agency to make choices. That, more than anything else, is what distinguishes them from good girls. Whereas Lacey and Medea and Jane Eyre\u2019s Bertha create their own alternatives when they\u2019re backed into a corner, good girls with plenty of options tend to move in whatever direction they\u2019re pushed. They are almost always manipulated or forced or tugged along by the dictates of propriety. Made to choose for themselves, like Hannah, good girls might not look so different from bad girls.",
