  "body": "Pep Guardiola has cast his eye over Manchester City\u2019s squad and has decided to build his side around Mart\u00edn Demichelis, Jes\u00fas Navas, Wilfried Bony and Aleksandar Kolarov. Not really. He\u2019s going to sell a load of players, including Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Vincent Kompany, and then City are going to sign Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Ilkay Gundogan, West Ham\u2019s Aaron Cresswell, Juventus\u2019s Paul Pogba and Everton\u2019s John Stones, and then they\u2019re going to lose Champions League semi-finals for the rest of eternity.   Related: Pep Guardiola must carry out major surgery to rouse Manchester City    Liverpool have joined the chase for the Charlton Athletic wonderkid Ademola Lookman. They\u2019re running round south London brandishing a giant net but they\u2019ll pay \u00a36m for him if that doesn\u2019t work. Despite Olivier Giroud once again demonstrating that he is the best striker in England by scoring no league goals in 15 games and it is biased to suggest anything else, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is on the hunt for another striker. He is looking at AZ Alkmaar\u2019s Vincent Janssen, Internazionale\u2019s Mauro Icardi and Juve\u2019s \u00c1lvaro Morata, while Arsenal are also gazing longingly at Leicester City\u2019s midfield dynamo, N\u2019golo Kant\u00e9. There\u2019s talk of a \u00a320m buyout clause in Kant\u00e9\u2019s contract and Arsenal will start the bidding at \u00a310m \u2013 and they won\u2019t pay a penny more! Manchester United want Real Madrid\u2019s out-of-favour centre-back Rapha\u00ebl Varane. Chelsea have agreed to sell Nemanja Matic to Juventus for \u00a320m. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho won\u2019t wait for United to appoint him. United already have a manager. Leicester City, the champions of England, are sniffing around Liverpool\u2019s Christian Benteke and Roma\u2019s Kostas Manolas. However, the wheels are already coming off: Chelsea and United want Danny Drinkwater.",
