  "body": "Most university students \u2013 63% according to a recent survey \u2013 are in favour of the National Union of Students (NUS) having a \u201cno platforming\u201d policy. The policy allows the union to block certain individuals or organisations from speaking at their events. However, no-platforming has been a source of tension over recent months. Critics on both the political left and the right have condemned the \u201cdisinvitation\u201d of various high-profile speakers as an attack on free speech. The policy makes regular headlines revealing the latest jilted and aggrieved activist, academic or politician. The NUS has borne the brunt of this criticism \u2013 a Spectator blog, for example, accused the organisation of cowardice. Yet amid all the outrage, details have become hazy. What exactly have these people done to so offend students? And perhaps more to the point, did these speakers actually get banned from university platforms? Boris Johnson, London Mayor     Boris Johnson (Photo by Jack Taylor/Getty Images) Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images    Which platform? An EU referendum debate at King\u2019s College London. Why no platform? Several media outlets including the Independent, the Huffington Post, and The Telegraph reported last week that King\u2019s Think Tank, a student-led policy institute, had called for the London mayor to be banned from taking part in an event because of his comments on Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d heritage and his claim that the president had an \u201cancestral dislike of the British Empire\u201d. An email from the Think Tank was widely reported to have withdrawn Boris Johnson\u2019s invitation to speak at an EU debate. Was he actually no-platformed? The media got the wrong end of the stick here: Johnson was never denied a platform by King\u2019s College students. The individual who wrote the email was not a student, but an external volunteer at the Think Tank. He had even signed off as \u201cdirector of EU Referendum Events at King\u2019s College London\u201d, which turned out to be a fake title.    In response to recent events, please see the below response from the King's Think Tank. #FreeSpeech #KCL pic.twitter.com/YTtj4Yx3RO\u2014 King's Think Tank (@KingsThinkTank) April 25, 2016    Even if the email had been legitimate, Johnson never accepted the invitation it was supposedly rescinding \u2013 so it\u2019d be a stretch to label this as \u201cno-platforming\u201d. Peter Tatchell, LGBT activist     Peter Tatchell Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    Which platform? A talk on \u201cre-radicalising queers\u201d at Canterbury Christ Church University. Why no platform? Fran Cowling, the NUS\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) representative, refused to share a panel with Tatchell at the talk in February, calling him racist and \u201ctransphobic\u201d. Her accusations were partly based on his signing of an open letter in the Observer against no-platforming, which, she claimed, helped to incite violence against transgender people. Was he actually no-platformed? Not really: Tatchell was not denied admission and he did give his talk at Canterbury. The NUS was criticised by right-leaning media after Cowling\u2019s snub, although the union was clear that this was not an official action.  Nick Lowles, director of Hope Not Hate     Nick Lowles Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/Antonio Olmos    Which platform? An anti-racism conference at Canterbury Christ Church University. Why no platform? The anti-racism campaigner said he was blocked from attending the event in February by NUS Black Students, a \u201cpolitically autonomous\u201d wing of the NUS, after he was accused of holding \u201cIslamophobic\u201d views. Lowles told the Guardian: \u201cMy crime, it seems, has been to repeatedly call on the anti-racist movement to do more to condemn on-street grooming by gangs and campaigning against Islamist extremist groups in the UK and abroad.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s amusing in its absurdity but it does reflect the failure of a small section of the left to understand that we have to confront extremism and intolerance in all its forms. My issue is with this small group of political activists and not with NUS itself, who I believe were unaware of this.\u201d Was he actually no-platformed? Lowles\u2019 invitation was certainly opposed by some students - or at least \u201cthe idea\u201d of it was - but it is unclear whether they blocked it. NUS president Megan Dunn distanced herself and the union from the group, saying: \u201cHope Not Hate is not on NUS\u2019s no-platform list. I would happily share a platform with anyone from Hope Not Hate tomorrow.\u201d Hope Not Hate was ultimately not represented at the event. Germaine Greer, writer     Germaine Greer Photograph: Michael Hall/Cardiff Univ    Which platform? A guest lecture at Cardiff University. Why no platform? Rachael Melhuish, women\u2019s officer at Cardiff University, called for Greer to be no-platformed last October for her \u201ctransphobic\u201d views. Melhuish and her fellow campaigners took particular issue with Greer\u2019s repeated assertion that post-operative transgender women are not women, and 3,000 students signed a petition urging staff to cancel the lecture. Was she actually no-platformed? Not successfully. Greer was invited by the university to give her lecture with the caveat: \u201cWe in no way condone discriminatory comments of any kind.\u201d She ended up delivering her lecture the following month, after calling the university\u2019s statement \u201cweak as piss\u201d.
