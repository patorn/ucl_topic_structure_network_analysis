  "body": "1) With the Champions League final looming, we present the protagonists: Real Madrid\u2019s first win in the first final against Stade de Reims in 1956 by Spain\u2019s equivalent of Path\u00e9 News; the goals from all the finals between 1956 and 1962 in which Real played seven times and won five. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have been the bridesmaid twice, their first appearance, losing 4-0 to Bayern Munich in 1974 and to Real in 2014. Real\u2019s history with the final is of course not only long but they\u2019ve been in some belters: Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 securing the club\u2019s first title for 32 years (since beating Partizan 2-1 in 1966) against Juventus in 1998; against Valencia in 2000 \u2013 with Steve McManaman delighting the fans and Zinedine Zidane\u2019s ballistic volley in 2002 against Bayer Leverkusen. Atl\u00e9tico, however, have the form against their rivals with seven wins in three years, the last away from home in La Liga in February. And as a final teaser, Cristiano Ronaldo opens the top five free-kicks from the Champions League this season.  2) Artistic and quite beautiful Path\u00e9 footage from June 1925 of the glorious Suzanne Lenglen, who dominated women\u2019s tennis at the time and won Wimbledon six times. The footage of Wimbledon is fantastic but not a patch on the extraordinary slo-mo of Lenglen\u2019s shots. Slightly more up to date: Rafael Nadal outfoxes Sam Groth at this year\u2019s French Open. 3) Top-end hissy fit here live on air as sports presenter Gary Radnich has a pop at his co-host Catherine Heenan on San Francisco\u2019s KRON-4 channel because she stole a \u201csports story\u201d from him \u2014 the casting of LeBron James in the Space Jam sequel. \u201cThe honour and dignity of KRON\u201d was at stake, apparently.            4) Chinas\u2019s Zhi Cong Li (known as Peter) survives a huge crash after he was unsighted and was launched up the back of Ryan Tveter\u2019s car at the F3 meeting in Spielberg last Saturday. Li was diagnosed with four fractured vertebrae and a shattered heel but is recovering well. Tveter was later released from hospital and the third driver involved, Pedro Piquet, emerged unhurt. 5) Ecuador\u2019s third division throws up a feast as Pelileo beat Indi Native 44-1. That\u2019s 45 \u201cGooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllll\u201d\u2019s from an apparently tireless commentator.  6) Competitive juggling. Yes it is a thing. Highlights from last week\u2019s blog 1) Bill Bailey has all manner of fun with the Match of the Day theme tune.            2) The love of baseball below the line continues with this magnificent collection. Best throws; best catches; biggest hits; busted bats; bust-ups; umpire pain; biffing finishes and Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals proving unhittable. 3) Fascinating look at the fans of the Seattle Sounders, through the eyes of their refreshingly down to earth part-owner Drew Carey. 4) Only five, Santi Carzola\u2019s son, Enzo, already has all the moves. 5) Naughty boxers and naughty MMA. 6) Jo\u00e3o Barbosa\u2019s wife is entirely unenamoured by the banking at Daytona and similarly, no shame in revisiting a classic of the genre: \u201cI just had polenta with stew. It\u2019s coming up \u2026\u201d Riccardo Patrese\u2019s wife shrieks her lungs out on a lap of Jerez with her husband.
