  "body": "George Zimmerman has listed the gun with which he killed Trayvon Martin in 2012 for auction, touting it as \u201cyour opportunity to own a piece of American history\u201d.  The former neighbourhood watch volunteer was acquitted two years ago in the death of the young unarmed African American, but the case sparked protests and a national debate about race relations.    Related: #BlackLivesMatter: the birth of a new civil rights movement    Zimmerman listed \u201cthe firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin\u201d on GunBroker.com on Thursday, with bidding scheduled to begin at 11am EDT on Thursday.  He wrote in the item description that it had recently been returned to him by the Department of Justice and was fully functional. \u201cMany have expressed interest in owning and displaying the firearm including the Smithsonian museum in Washington D.C. This is a piece of American history. It has been featured in several publications and in current university text books. Offers to purchase the firearm have been received; however, the offers were to use the gun in a fashion I did not feel comfortable with.\u201d The listing was illustrated by photos of the weapon taken during Zimmerman\u2019s trial. The gun, a Kel-Tec PF-9 9mm, was billed as a \u201ccollectible firearm\u201d and had a starting price of US$5,000. According to an interview with a local Fox affiliate, excerpts of which were shared on Twitter, Zimmerman said it was \u201ctime to move past the firearm, and if I sell it and it sells, I move past it\u201d.    #GeorgeZimmerman on selling gun: \"What I've decided to do is not cower; I'm a free American I can do what I want with my possessions.\"#FOX35\u2014 Sonni Abatta (@SonniAbatta) May 12, 2016      The Trayvon Martin foundation, set up after the youth\u2019s death to \u201cend senseless gun violence\u201d, said it had \u201cno comment on the actions of that person\u201d. Tracy Martin, the killed teenager\u2019s father, said on Thursday that he had \u201cno comment on the actions of that person that murdered Trayvon\u201d. In a statement issued through Tallahassee civil rights attorneys Benjamin Crump and Daryl Parks, who have represented the family since the shooting, Martin said: \u201cThe Trayvon Martin Foundation is committed to ending gun violence in the United States. We are laser focused on furthering that mission.\u201d Martin and Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon\u2019s mother, established the Miami-based foundation in the wake of their son\u2019s death to promote anti-gun legislation, offer support to other families who have lost a child through gun violence and provide mentoring for at-risk youths.

Zimmerman wrote that he was \u201cproud to announce\u201d that a portion of the proceeds raised would be used to \u201cfight BLM [Black Lives Matter] violence against Law Enforcement officers\u201d as well as ending the career of Angela Corey, his prosecutor \u2013 \u201cand Hillary Clinton\u2019s anti-firearm rhetoric\u201d.

Zimmerman is a verified member of GunBroker.com and listed his location as Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman was reportedly banned from Twitter in December but used the platform to voice similar views, including an apparent reference to Martin as a \u201cmoron\u201d, a description of the BLM movement as \u201cblack slime matters\u201d and a retweet of a post showing Martin\u2019s lifeless body with the caption, \u201cZ-man is a one-man army\u201d.     Trayvon Martin, left, and George Zimmerman. Photograph: AP    The Florida man, a Neighbourhood Watch coordinator, shot and killed Martin in February 2012 after a violent altercation in a Sanford housing community. In a police call minutes before the killing, Zimmerman said he could see \u201ca real suspicious guy\u201d in the neighbourhood who \u201clooks like he is up to no good\u201d. Martin, who was unarmed, was returning from a convenience store.  Zimmerman was not initially charged, until protests spread around the country demanding a full investigation. He successfully argued at a murder trial that he had acted in self-defence and was acquitted in July 2013. In February 2015 the federal justice department said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the 32-year-old for hate crimes.",
