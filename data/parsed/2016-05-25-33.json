  "body": "\u2022 After defeating Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington went on to become prime minister in 1828, not 1822 as we had it in an Opinion piece (Forget Hitler, think Wellington, 25\u00a0May, page 31). \u2022 Two life peers were given the wrong titles in early editions of Monday\u2019s paper. Shirley Williams is a baroness, not a dame (Osborne: vote for Brexit would lead to \u2018DIY recession\u2019\u200b, page 6); Michael Heseltine is a baron not a knight (Don\u2019t muzzle immigration debate, minister warns, page 7). \u2022 A piece about the singer Adele referred to her \u201creticence to put herself in the public eye\u201d; reluctance, that should have been. Reticence means an unwillingness to speak (She really has it\u00a0all: Adele signs Sony deal, 24 May, page 3). \u2022 The edition numbers given on the leader page in Friday\u2019s Saturday\u2019s and Monday\u2019s papers were 500 less than they should have been. Friday\u2019s should have been labelled as edition number 52,789, Saturday\u2019s as 52,790, and Monday\u2019s as 52,791.",
