A journalist and lawyer, Paul was previously the Director of Editorial Policies of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation where he led reform of the public broadcaster\u2019s self regulation framework. He led the revision of the Australian Journalists\u2019 Association ethics code and is also the recipient of a Walkley Award for most outstanding contribution to journalism.

In 2008 it was replaced by a limited company with the same core purpose of the original trust: to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity, while its subsidiary aims are to champion its principles and to promote freedom of the press in the UK and elsewhere. Other than to cover expense, The Scott Trust takes no dividend from the Group\u2019s businesses, whose profits are instead reinvested to sustain journalism that is free from commercial or political interference. The Trust Board is chaired by Dame Liz Forgan and currently consists of executives within GMG, external members, a member of the Scott family and a member of Guardian News & Media\u2019s editorial staff. About GMG Guardian Media Group (GMG) is amongst the UK\u2019s leading media organisations. Its core business is Guardian News & Media (GNM), publisher of theguardian.com, one of the largest English-speaking quality newspaper websites in the world. In the UK, GNM publishes the Guardian newspaper six days a week and the world\u2019s oldest Sunday newspaper, The Observer. GMG has also built an endowment fund, which includes the proceeds from the 2014 disposal of its 50.1% holding in Trader Media Group. \u200eThe sole purpose of the fund is to secure the editorial independence and financial security of the Guardian in perpetuity. The business conduct of the Group is guided by The Scott Trust values. For further information visit www.theguardian.com/gmg",
