Before you know anything about the gig in question \u2013 who\u2019s playing, what the venue is and whether or not Mark Reckless will be beatboxing as the support act \u2013 those three simple words should act as a warning to most right-thinking people to stay away. Last time Brexit Live tried to present anything it didn\u2019t go tot smoothly: a gig at Birmingham\u2019s Genting Arena set for 8 May had to be scrapped after the headliners \u2013 drum\u2019n\u2019bass duo Sigma \u2013 pulled out on the grounds that nobody had told them the show would be in support of, er, Brexit.   Related: Leave Aid: Grassroots Out\u2019s anti-EU festival is the hottest music event of the year     But this time would be different. Which is why BrexitLive booked political thinkers such as 5ive, Alesha Dixon, East 17, Sister Sledge and Gwen Dickey to perform at its BPop Live event on 19 June. What could possibly go wrong? Now I know what you\u2019re thinking: when will 5ive stop banging on about the bloody EU? Can Alesha Dixon even perform a song these days without dropping lyrics about Norway\u2019s unique trade agreements? And, er, who the hell is Gwen Dickey? Or maybe not. Maybe you\u2019re thinking: do any of these artists actually care about Brexit? After listening to every 5ive track ever recorded, I had to admit it was hard to detect a firm political stance either way. Perhaps that\u2019s to be expected with a group famed for using subtle metaphor and ambiguity in their work \u2013 it was undeniable that 5ive would make you get down, but harder to say whether they\u2019d make you vote for Britain to leave the EU, too. Luckily, the band were less guarded on social media. \u201cGot to put it out there,\u201d tweeted the band\u2019s Ritchie Neville back in May before anyone could shout, \u201cNo you don\u2019t, Ritchie!\u201d He continued: \u201cDoes this EU debate seem a tad one sided? It should be a two sided debate but I\u2019m only really being force fed 1 side.\u201d     Alesha Dixon: not appearing Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage    It seemed as if 5ive really did support the Brexit cause. But then, while writing this piece, the news came in that the headliners had pulled out of the concert \u2013 on the grounds that they didn\u2019t realise it would be a political event. Before we\u2019d finished updating the story, Dixon\u2019s people announced that she would not be playing either, on the grounds that BPopLive seemed like \u201cmore of a political rally\u201d than a gig and that \u201cAlesha has no political allegiances either way on this issue\u201d. At this rate, BPopLive was going to consist of nothing more than Gwen Dickey, alone on a massive stage, ranting against the wanton bureaucracy being foisted upon us by Brussels. And given that she\u2019s the singer in 70s soul-funksters Rose Royce and probably doesn\u2019t know or care what a Brexit is, even that looks unlikely. It seems that the only way to successfully put on a pro-Brexit pop concert is to make no mention at all of the word Brexit \u2013 arguably quite difficult for a company called Brexit Live.",
