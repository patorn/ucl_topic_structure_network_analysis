  "body": "When Donald Trump met with Paul Ryan in Washington on Thursday, you could say it was a meeting between the current and possibly future nominee of the Republican party. Or you could say it was a battle for the soul of the party, between a conservative reformer and nativist rabble-rouser. The latter is how Ryan himself portrayed the debate when he torpedoed the orange flagship on CNN last week. Saying he \u201cjust wasn\u2019t ready\u201d to support Trump, the House speaker warned that Trump\u2019s platform was not inclusive, presidential or, well, conservative. \u201cWe don\u2019t always nominate a Lincoln or a Reagan every four years, but we hope that our nominee aspires to be Lincoln- or Reagan-esque, that that person advances the principles of our party and appeals to a wide, vast majority of Americans,\u201d Ryan said.   Related: Paul Ryan: creep, failure, hero of the hour | Dave Schilling    Ryan insisted that the burden of unifying the party rested with Trump. \u201cSaying we\u2019re unified doesn\u2019t in and of itself unify us,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut actually taking the principles that we all believe in, showing that there\u2019s a dedication to those, and running a principled campaign that Republicans can be proud about and that can actually appeal to a majority of Americans \u2013 that to me is what it takes to unify this party.\u201d Trump responded in that most presidential of ways: by making it personal. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to support Speaker Ryan\u2019s agenda,\u201d he said in a statement. At least the slap wasn\u2019t on Twitter. So when the two great leaders met on Thursday morning, somewhere behind a monster scrum of live-tweeting reporters, the language was a diplomatic veneer of unity. In their joint communique, Trump and Ryan said: \u201cWhile we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground.\u201d The joint statement did not detail what that common ground looks like, other than defeating Hillary Clinton. Which sounds much like the statements of a Miss Universe contestant at one of Trump\u2019s beauty pageants: both contestants agree that they want to travel, help children and work for world peace. Ryan later told reporters a little more about those \u201cfew differences\u201d, which sounded rather fundamental. \u201cHow do we keep adding and adding and adding voters while not subtracting any voters,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t have to say: like Latinos or women, for instance.           Paul Ryan: Republican party cannot pretend to be unified    Ryan\u2019s challenge is particularly exquisite. He needs unity because his day job is otherwise impossible. It was only six months ago that power was thrust upon him when his own House Republicans devoured both his predecessor, John Boehner, and the anointed successor, Kevin McCarthy. Boehner was sick of the civil war, while his chosen successor was consumed by it. McCarthy committed the unforgivable sin of being honest on TV when he admitted that the Benghazi committee supposedly investigating the deadly attacks in Libya in 2012 was really intended to destroy Clinton\u2019s poll numbers. McCarthy was crushed by the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, who made Boehner\u2019s position a living hell. That caucus is now almost uniformly opposed to Trump (while McCarthy now loves Trump). There are some early efforts to engineer a meeting between the caucus and the nominee, in an attempt to redefine how an unstoppable force can meet immovable object. Given a choice between placating the Freedom Caucus and placating Donald Trump, Ryan is wisely choosing self-preservation with the former. \u201cTo pretend we\u2019re unified without actually unifying, then we go into the fall at half strength,\u201d Ryan told reporters after meeting with House GOP members on Wednesday. Some things are easier when your name is Trump: securing bank loans, declaring bankruptcy, amassing Twitter followers and getting booked for exclusive TV interviews. Some things are harder: mastering policy, acting presidential, leading a party whose power-brokers loathe you. What does peace in the Republican look like? Why, Paul Ryan of course. \u201cI\u2019d love to see him run for president,\u201d Mitt Romney reportedly told a private fundraiser meeting last week, according to the New York Times. The last Republican nominee added his name to a long list of pro-Ryan grandees, including Boehner himself, as well as Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. It\u2019s one thing to shake hands across a party after primary season; it\u2019s entirely different negotiating an armistice between rival armies in the midst of bloody civil war. Especially when the armies believe they have everything left to fight for.",
