  "body": "This is the sequel to The D\u2019Evil Diaries. Tomasina Covelli is a 10 year-old girl who lives in Dark Angel Palace in Hell with Satan and his son Jinx. All of the other demons are out to get her until Jinx\u2019s creepy step-mum comes up with a way for her to fit in - a competition. But is it all that it seems? This is a great sequel to The D\u2019Evil Diaries and I actually liked this one the most. There are lots of bits in it that make me laugh. I liked this book so much I wish there was a third one!         Recommended reading age: 9 yrs and above. You will like this book if you like: The D\u2019Evil Diaries. It made me laugh a lot.
