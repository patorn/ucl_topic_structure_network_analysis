  "body": "The sight of boxes of alphonso and sindhri mangoes piled up outside my local Lebanese grocer is a sure sign that summer is at last arriving. Unlike those hard, green mangoes you find in supermarkets all year round, these ones are sweet, fragrant and so irresistibly juicy that they need to be cut open and devoured in close proximity to a tap (or stream), for cleaning sticky hands and chin afterwards. Although these mangoes are wonderful for breakfast or in salads, they also make a glorious and simple chutney for eating over the summer with onion bhajis, barbecued chicken or grilled fish. Pudding-wise, I look to Mexico for inspiration (well, of course I do), where rice pudding is not the hot, cold-weather dish we know here, but a light, chilled pudding scented with vanilla and citrus. It\u2019s the perfect pudding for a sunny day. Flattened tandoori chicken thighs with mango relish The relish is quick to make and is lovely with this spiced chicken, which can be cooked under the grill or on the barbecue, depending on the weather. Serves four. 8 skinless and boneless chicken thighs3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped\u00bd small thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped1 small red chilli, roughly chopped\u00bd tsp turmeric powder2 tsp garam masala1 tsp paprika150g natural yoghurt For the mango relish150g soft brown sugar150ml white-wine vinegar1 star anise\u00bd red onion, peeled and very finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and very finely chopped1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped1 tsp black mustard seeds1 red chilli, finely chopped3-4 ripe, sweet mangoes, stoned, peeled and roughly choppedSalt and freshly ground black pepper First prepare the chicken. Put each thigh between two sheets of clingfilm and flatten by bashing with a rolling pin until it\u2019s roughly 1cm thick. Put the flattened, tenderised chicken in a bowl. In a pestle and mortar, bash the garlic, ginger and chilli to a rough paste, then add to the bowl with the remaining chicken ingredients, rubbing in the marinade so the meat is coated. Refrigerate while while you make the relish. Put the sugar and vinegar in a saucepan on a medium-low heat, bring to a boil and, once the sugar has dissolved, stir in all the other ingredients and add a good pinch each of salt and pepper. Leave to simmer for 25-30 minutes, until the liquid has reduced, then take off the heat, adjust the seasoning to taste, then set aside to cool. Heat the grill (or barbecue). Season the chicken all over, then lay on a rack set over an oven tray. Grill for 10-12 minutes, turning it halfway through. When the chicken is brown at the edges and cooked though (check by cutting into a thigh: if the juices run clear, it\u2019s done), transfer to plates and serve with the relish alongside. To bulk it up into a full meal, add a light cucumber salad and/or a cardamom rice salad with flaked almonds and dried apricots.

Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay    Wholegrain jasmine rice has a gorgeous nuttiness, but use white jasmine if need be. Coconut sugar is now widely available in delis, healthfood shops and online, and has wonderful butterscotch notes, but soft brown sugar will work if you can\u2019t find any. Serves four to six. 150g Thai jasmine wholegrain rice25g coconut sugar30g caster sugar400g tin coconut milk, plus one tin\u2019s worth of cold water\u00bd tsp vanilla extract1 tsp orange blossom water (optional)Juice and zest of 2 limes1-2 handfuls unsweetened flaked coconut2 alphonso mangoes100-150ml coconut (or Greek) yoghurt Heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. In a 500ml ovenproof dish, mix the rice, sugars, coconut milk, water, vanilla, orange blossom water (if using) and lime zest. Stir in a tablespoon of lime juice, then bake for about 90 minutes, until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid but is still moist; give it a stir every half-hour or so. Check the grains: they should be plump and tender. If they are not, bake for 15 minutes longer, or until cooked. Meanwhile, spread the flaked coconut in a baking tray and toast in the same oven until pale gold all over. Once the rice is cooked, remove the dish from the oven, leave to cool, then cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least two hours. When you\u2019re ready to eat, peel, stone and dice the mango (it really doesn\u2019t matter if the pieces aren\u2019t all a perfect, uniform size), then toss with the remaining lime juice. Stir the yoghurt through the pudding (you\u2019re aiming for a lovely, loose consistency that drops easily from the spoon, a bit like a wet risotto), then serve topped with the mangoes and toasted coconut.    Related: The weekend cook: treat yourself to a blow-out breakfast    And for the rest of the week\u2026 Indian and Pakistani mangoes have a relatively short season, so make the most of them while you can. They make fantastic sorbets, ice-creams and lassis, or eat them as they do in Mexico, in a simple fruit salad mixed with fresh lime juice and a sprinkling of blitzed dried chilli, lemon zest, sugar and salt. One of my favouite ways to serve the mango relish is to stuff a pitta with a simple, last-minute pea and potato curry and some crisp baby gem, all topped with a big spoonful of the chutney. With the rice pudding, you could cut down the sugar a little and add a few tablespoons of chia seeds \u2013 that would also make a beautiful, nutritious and unusual breakfast. Leftover coconut flakes can be toasted and added to muesli for a sweet, nutty touch.",
