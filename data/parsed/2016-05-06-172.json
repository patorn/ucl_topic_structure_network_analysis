Li Jinyuan, the billionaire owner of direct-sales firm Tiens Group, chartered 20 planes and booked 1,650 hotel rooms for the party. After their Madrid visit, the workers will board four specially reserved high-speed trains to Barcelona.

The workers then enjoyed a lunch of paella and sangr\u00eda.  \u201cWe chose Spain because the people are warm, friendly and passionate,\u201d said Li Zongmin, the magnate\u2019s son and a Tiens vice-president. \u201cFurthermore, the food is delicious.\u201d France rolled out the red carpet for Li Jinyuan last year after he decided to send more than 6,400 of his employees there in what was reputedly the biggest tour group ever to visit the country. For that mass holiday, Li, who is worth at least $5.9bn and has been ranked as China\u2019s 33rd richest person, splashed out on 84 planes, 200 hotels and a private tour of the Louvre.

Last May, a direct-sales company called Infinitus China rewarded 12,700 workers with a trip to Thailand, where organisers laid on a series of giant banquets in the seaside town of Pattaya.  \u201cThe company chose Thailand because they were impressed with our beaches, temples, cultural performances and fruits,\u201d one of the mega-group\u2019s guides told Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post at the time.     Mass tours for workers have been popular with Chinese companies as a way of raising morale and boosting marketing. Photograph: Kiko Huesca/EPA    The motivation to pay for these industrial-sized tour groups appears to be in part a ruse by extravagant billionaires to please their staff, and in part a marketing technique. The Global Times, a Communist party tabloid, heaped praise on Li\u2019s C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur treat, describing such trips as proof of China\u2019s rise.  \u201cBy carrying out the collective France trip in a lavish manner, Tiens killed two birds with one stone, both motivating its staff members and publicising the company,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s editor said. \u201cThanks to the market economy, many Chinese have gotten rich and Chinese firms have accumulated strength.\u201d",
