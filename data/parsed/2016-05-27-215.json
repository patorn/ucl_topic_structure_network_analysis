Related: Chelsea Manning files appeal against 'grossly unfair' 35-year prison sentence    Manning, 28, was arrested at the Forward Operating Base Hammer outside Baghdad on 27 May 2010 and has endured traumatic times during her return to the US and prolonged detention in solitary confinement.  The six years in prison she has just completed amount to the most severe punishment of a whistleblower in the modern era. The anniversary of Manning\u2019s arrest and detention comes as the spotlight has again fallen on the Obama administration\u2019s tough approach to pursuing whistleblowers. John Crane, former head of the Pentagon\u2019s whistleblower unit, revealed this week that instead of providing a safe channel for government employees to report internal wrongdoing, the system actively retaliates against them for daring to sound the alarm. Despite her portrayal by the US government as a dangerous and reckless criminal, Manning remains an admired figure among advocates of more transparent government.  NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who remains in Russia having been charged by the US government with espionage over his leaks to the Guardian and other news organizations, said that Manning was the first American to be sentenced to decades of prison \u201cfor revealing truthful information to the press. Her conviction \u2013 under a law even the ACLU says violates the constitution \u2013 is not just an injustice, it\u2019s a threat to journalism.\u201dWikiLeaks\u2019 founder and editor, Julian Assange, speaking from the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he is fighting extradition to Sweden to face questioning on sexual assault allegations, said that Manning had already won the moral battle: \u201cEvery year, new whistleblowers step forward to follow her example. Now it is time for Manning to win her legal battle. The only just outcome in Chelsea Manning\u2019s case is her unconditional release, compensation for the unlawful treatment she has undergone, and a serious commitment to investigating the wrongdoing her alleged disclosures have brought to light.\u201d Daniel Ellsberg is America\u2019s most celebrated whistleblower, having in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers, revealing the conduct of the Vietnam war. He marked the anniversary of Manning\u2019s arrest by saying: \u201cI waited 40 years for Chelsea Manning. I don\u2019t want to wait another 30 to thank her in freedom.\u201d    I waited 40 years for Chelsea Manning. I don\u2019t want to wait another 30 to thank her in freedom  Daniel Ellsberg     The Courage Foundation, an international organization that supports whistleblowers including Snowden, has this week launched a new European fundraising effort to help cover the costs of Manning\u2019s appeal against her 35-year sentence.  Sarah Harrison, the group\u2019s acting director, called her punishment a travesty.  \u201cChelsea Manning is one of the most important figures of the digital age and a hero to many of us,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cHer incarceration will be a lasting stain on America\u2019s reputation.\u201d Last week, Manning\u2019s appeal was lodged with the US army court of criminal appeals in Virginia. It calls for a reduction of the \u201cgrossly unfair and unprecedented\u201d sentence to 10 years, noting pointedly that David Petraeus, the former CIA director who passed classified information to his biographer and then lover, was fined and given two years\u2019 probation with no prison time.

The legal team is awaiting the US government\u2019s response to the appeal filing; it will then prepare to argue the case for a sentence reduction in front of the appeals court. \u201cSince her conviction, support for Chelsea has only grown,\u201d Hollander said, \u201cas the world recognizes her commitments to justice, equality and a more accountable government.\u201d In 2013, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in military prison, for leaking as many as 700,000 official secret documents. The documents included many cables from US embassies around the world, war logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and the famous \u201ccollateral murder\u201d video of an Apache helicopter attack in Baghdad on a group of civilians including Reuters photographers.  Manning is being held in the military brig at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, where she is involved in separate legal action relating to her desire to transition as a transgender woman.
