  "body": "Everybody wants to own the end of the world. That\u2019s what my father had said, taking off his vintage sunglasses to reveal another pair of vintage sunglasses. He liked to keep the world opaque. Some months later those words came back to me as the private jet he had sent for me landed at the Convergence complex on the edge of nowhere. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked. \u201cSomewhere near Kazakhstan,\u201d he said. \u201cKyrgyzstan?\u201d \u201cSomewhere near there, too.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not being very helpful.\u201d \u201cNo, but I am being deep. Everywhere is somewhere.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve grown a beard. That surprises me.\u201d   Related: Zero K by Don DeLillo review \u2013 the problem of mortality    He took me down 38 levels to where his second wife, Artis, was in the waiting room. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m waiting to live for ever. Ars longa, vita brevis.\u201d My billionaire father Jeffrey Lockhart explained that Artis was dying of multiple sclerosis and had come to the Convergence complex to be cryogenically frozen so that she could be brought back to life with nanobots in several thousand years. He showed me a room of frozen, hairless, headless bodies all doing nothing. One of them I called Dahlia. Another I imagined to be called Keith. Two identical brothers walked into the room. I decided to call them the Stenmark Brothers. \u201cWe run this Zero K facility,\u201d they said in unison. \u201cSo when is she going to not die?\u201d I asked. \u201cTomorrow is the time for her to pass over. Or possibly the day after that.\u201d I went back to my cell where the Monk met me. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d I asked. \u201cI help people Converge,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you find this book a bit tiresome?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not working for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather be dead.\u201d I spent some time dreaming about my mother, Madeline. My father had walked out on us when I was 10 and she had later died of a stroke. She had once told me my father\u2019s real name was Nicholas Smatterthwaite. I never thought to ask him why he now called himself Jeffrey Lockhart.   Related: Don DeLillo: \u2018I think of myself as the kid from the Bronx\u2019    \u201cCan you say my mother\u2019s name?\u201d I asked him later. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I can tell you I have decided to Converge at the same time as Artis today.\u201d We went down to Level Minus 118 where Artis was in the process of Converging. \u201cYou know what,\u201d my father said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will Converge right now.\u201d Hi. I\u2019m Artis. I\u2019ve just Converged. I think. I\u2019ve been given a chapter in which nothing happens. You can skip it if you like. We flew back to New York, where I went for a lot of job interviews. \u201cI can give you a job, if you like,\u201d my father said. \u201cI prefer just going to the interviews,\u201d I said. \u201cImminence outweighs immanence.\u201d At some point, I met a girl called Emma and we may or may not have become lovers. Whether we did it or not depends on whether she was a product of my imagination. You will have to figure that one out for yourself. One day as we took a cab downtown, Emma overheard the driver saying he was a member of the Taliban. Emma had an adopted son called Stak who went missing. I wasn\u2019t that much bothered. Much like you.      Two years later, my father told me he had decided to Converge so we flew back to the facility that was quite near both Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. \u201cWe\u2019ve been expecting you,\u201d said the Stenmark Brothers in unison. \u201cYou could Converge as well,\u201d my father said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass. Everyone in this novel is already braindead anyway.\u201d \u201cBut can you just have one last go at saying my mother\u2019s name before you do Converge?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I went to my room and watched a video of Stak being killed in a war zone. I went back to New York. Emma called to say she was fed up with being locked in endless pretentious conversations and that she was still looking for Stak. I decided not to tell her I had seen him die. And that\u2019s about it really. Digested read, digested: Not-so-Special K",
