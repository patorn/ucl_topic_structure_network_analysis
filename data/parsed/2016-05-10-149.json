  "body": "Way back in 2014, I reviewed Solitaire, Alice Oseman\u2019s first novel. Whilst I did say I didn\u2019t find it \u2018amazingly good\u2019, I did think it was pretty great. It had a great storyline, characters that you wanted to know more about and a setting every reader could relate to in some way. Oseman is a talented writer, and so when Radio Silence was announced, and I managed to get hold of an early manuscript of it, I was naturally very excited. I read it within two days, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.  Frances Janvier has always been, and seemingly always will be, a complete study machine, with the single aim of getting into the elite university she\u2019s always dreamed of. Then she finds out Aled is behind the internet podcast that she\u2019s been a fan of and drawing fan art about under the name Toulouser online for years. He asks her to start making the official art for the show, and he\u2019s found the real Frances, who is unafraid to be herself. Then the podcast goes viral, and the trust is broken. It\u2019s only by facing up to your fears that you can overcome them. And it\u2019s only by being your true self that you can find happiness. It\u2019s time for Frances, and Aled, to listen to their own voices.          If she hadn\u2019t already done it with Solitaire, then Oseman has definitely nailed the teenage voice with Radio Silence, and not only has she nailed it, she\u2019s blown it out of the water. Oseman has captured the unique pressures faced by teenagers, from school, what happens after school, relationships (but not necessarily those for love, mind you) and she\u2019s thrown them all into this novel. This book takes so many themes that every teenager faces, and crafts them into a story in such a great way that everyone in some way can relate to this story. Most teens have felt the struggle of academically achieving versus doing what you want with your own life, but Radio Silence takes it, gives it to Frances and makes it into something relatable and interesting to read about.\u00a0 Saying a book is relatable is sometimes used as a throwaway, but with Radio Silence you are able to read this book and connect with it. It\u2019s not a book where you put it down after reading it and say, \u2018That was a nice book\u2019, it\u2019s a book where you want to know more.\u00a0   Related: How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?    It\u2019s time you got to know Alice Oseman now if you don\u2019t know her already. Radio Silence is quite possibly the best UKYA of 2016, if not the best YA of 2016, so far, and I\u2019m very much looking forward to reading whatever Oseman has in store next (and whatever it is, she\u2019s vlogging it so I will find out!)
