During a garden party at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, a pool cameraman working on behalf of British broadcasters filmed her discussing Xi\u2019s trip with Metropolitan police commander Lucy D\u2019Orsi.

D\u2019Orsi complained to the Queen that Xi\u2019s visit had been \u201cquite a testing time for me\u201d and claimed that at one point Chinese officials \u201cwalked out\u201d on both her and the British ambassador, telling her \u201cthat the trip was off\u201d. \u201cExtraordinary,\u201d the Queen replied. \u201cIt\u2019s very rude and very undiplomatic, I thought,\u201d the police commander concluded.

Photograph: AP    Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, declined to directly address the Queen\u2019s comments or confirm whether the \u201cgolden era\u201d was still alive.  \u201cPresident Xi\u2019s visit to the UK last year was a very successful one. Both sides have made great efforts for the success of the visit and the two sides highly recognised that,\u201d Lu said. But pressed by the Guardian to confirm whether the \u201cgolden era\u201d \u2013 which he said had officially started with Xi\u2019s state visit \u2013 was still ongoing, Lu replied: \u201cBoth sides have expressed the hope that they would implement the outcomes of President Xi\u2019s visit and push forwards a steady and stable rise of the bilateral relationship. This requires the common efforts of both sides.\u201d Asked if that meant the special relationship was over, Lu said: \u201cYou can put my answers today together.\u201d \u2018I have already said what I can say\u2019 Asked if he had been surprised by the Queen\u2019s comments, he laughed and said: \u201cI have already said what I can say.\u201d  Speaking ahead of Xi\u2019s arrival, Woodward, a China specialist who has worked in the UK foreign office for more than two decades, predicted a bright future for ties between the two nations. \u201cWe are looking forward to a golden visit in a golden year that launches a golden decade,\u201d she told reporters. Xi toasted the upgraded friendship during a trip to a Buckinghamshire pub with the British prime minister, David Cameron, and said he had been \u201cdeeply impressed by the vitality of China-UK relations\u201d.

Last week, China\u2019s ambassador in London, Liu Xiaoming, accused the US and UK of \u201cmaking trouble in the South China Sea\u201d by opposing his country\u2019s activities in the region. \u201cThese nations should desist from meddling and muddling,\u201d Liu wrote, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency. The Queen\u2019s comments were less incendiary than those made by her son, Prince Charles, after Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese control in 1997. In a memo about the handover ceremony, Prince Charles described the Communist party\u2019s elderly leaders as a \u201cgroup of appalling old waxworks\u201d and mocked the \u201cawful Soviet-style display\u201d of goose-stepping Chinese soldiers at the event. Visit \u2018proceeded smoothly\u2019 The British embassy in Beijing declined to comment on claims the ambassador had been mistreated by Chinese officials or provide details of the circumstances under which they supposedly walked out on Woodward.

A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: \u201cThe Chinese state visit was extremely successful and all parties worked closely to ensure it proceeded smoothly.\u201d Foreign diplomats who have met Xi Jinping, a man some call China\u2019s most authoritarian leader since Mao Zedong, describe him as a charming and engaging personality. But China\u2019s diplomats have faced previous accusations of ungraceful behaviour. In 2014, officials representing the prime minister, Li Keqiang, were accused of threatening to cancel a three-day trip to Britain unless he was granted an audience with the Queen. The meeting was subsequently arranged. \u201cThe Chinese are hard negotiators,\u201d one government source told the Times. Transcript Lord Chamberlain: Can I present Commander Lucy D\u2019Orsi, who was gold commander during the Chinese state visit. Queen: Oh, bad luck. Lord Chamberlain: And who was seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese, but she managed to hold her own and remain in command. And her mother, Judith, who\u2019s involved in child protection and social work. Judith Copson: Yes, I\u2019m very proud of my daughter. Lord Chamberlain: You must tell your story. D\u2019Orsi: Yes, I was the gold commander, so I\u2019m not sure whether you knew, but it was quite a testing time for me. Queen: Yes, I did. D\u2019Orsi: It was \u2026 I think at the point that they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off, that I felt \u2026 Queen: They were very rude to the ambassador. D\u2019Orsi: They were, well, yes she was, Barbara [Woodward] was with me and they walked out on both of us. Queen: Extraordinary. Copson: I know, it\u2019s unbelievable. D\u2019Orsi: It was very rude and very undiplomatic, I thought.",
