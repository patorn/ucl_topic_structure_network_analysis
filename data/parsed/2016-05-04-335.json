  "body": "China\u2019s military is appealing to the younger generation with a slick new recruitment video featuring aircraft carriers, rocket launchers, tanks and fighter jets, all set to a rousing rap-rock soundtrack. With lyrics such as \u201cjust waiting for the order to kill, kill, kill\u201d, the video appears aimed at millennials brought up on first-person shooter video games such as Call of Duty. While no potential opponents are identified in the clip, it cautions that \u201cwar can break out at any time\u201d and asks \u201care you ready?\u201d   Related: China to release last prisoner jailed over Tiananmen Square protests    At one point in the three-minute film, a man brandishing an AK-47 is shot in the head. The video, available on Wednesday via a link on the defence ministry\u2019s official website, appears as the 2.3 million-member People\u2019s Liberation Army is downsizing in an effort to boost its war-fighting capabilities. Chief among those steps is a cut of 300,000 personnel, while the navy, missile corps and air force are receiving more attention and funding. The video presents an image of the PLA as a hi-tech and high-powered force. While catering to traditional patriotic sentiments, it heavily emphasises the advances made by the world\u2019s largest standing military as it takes on missions further afield.    Related: China military parade shows might as Xi Jinping pledges 300,000 cut in army    China\u2019s sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, is featured prominently, as are latest generation tanks, warplanes, attack helicopters and ballistic missiles that were showcased in a massive military parade through the heart of Beijing in September. \u201cAmbassadors of peace, we are the guardians of China. Ambassadors of power, we are the tiger\u2019s teeth,\u201d said some of the lyrics. It ends with a shot of a soldier passionately planting a Chinese flag into a patch of presumably foreign soil.  Traditionally focused on land-based threats and China\u2019s threat to invade Taiwan, the PLA has taken on increasingly complex tasks, including long-range aerial patrols in the East China Sea, an anti-piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden and defending Beijing\u2019s maritime claims in the South China Sea.
