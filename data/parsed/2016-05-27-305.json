It\u2019s a country in which women struggle to be heard. But Marcatus QED, a global agri-food solutions company, has come up with a way of giving women a stronger voice. The company \u2013 which works with producers contracting 18,000 smallholder farmer families across its gherkin supply chain in south India \u2013 has teamed up with a range of organisations, including NGOs Oxfam and Digital Green and the Indian consultancy Centre for Knowledge Societies, to design a culturally appropriate training programme.  Funded by Unilever\u2019s Enhancing Livelihoods Fund, the training programme relies heavily on videos produced in local languages by local people who have often never touched a camera.    Related: Fair play: business can help kick sexism out of sport    These videos, which cover topics such as pest control, can then be screened to entire villages in one go. Many videos feature women in the lead roles, and screenings are fitted in around women\u2019s work; they are specifically scripted to speak to female farmers. \u201cThe way that the culture is, women [at training sessions] tend to say: \u2018Oh well, the men are here so we don\u2019t have to be here,\u2019\u201d says Sona Kalra, Marcatus QED\u2019s sustainability and communications global lead. \u201cWe wanted \u2026 the head person in the video, to be the woman explaining how to do the work.\u201d Today, around half of the videos feature decision-making women, but that change has been introduced step by step; throughout the years Marcatus has learned that you can\u2019t just barge in and demand full gender equality.  \u201cYou have to be working within the context of what already exists,\u201d says Kalra. \u201cWe are trying to empower women to make decisions within the context of the culture.\u201d Maracatus QED is the 2016 winner of the diversity and inclusion category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards.  This article was amended on 31 May 2016 to correct Sona Kalra\u2019s job title. It was further amended on 2 June 2016 to remove a misleading section of a quote.",
