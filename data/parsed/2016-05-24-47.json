  "body": "Four family members involved in mistreating vulnerable men who were forced to work like slaves have been jailed for a total of 27 years. Patrick Joseph Connors, his son Patrick Dean Connors, nephew William Connors and son-in-law Lee Christopher Carbis were convicted on Tuesday after the court heard how one victim was forced to do hard manual labour for as little as \u00a35 a day. When he tried to flee, he was hunted down and brought back. A second man said years of malnutrition had seen him develop osteoporosis. He also told how he still constantly looks over his shoulder and feels as though he is wearing \u201cinvisible shackles\u201d. The first victim, Michael John Hughes, left his native Scotland for south Wales to seek a better life, Cardiff crown court was told, but he ended up working more than 20 years for the Connors family.  Hughes, 46, said he was beaten if he did not do as he was told and he and the other man were made to live in sheds without heating. They had to carry out building work and road laying. Jurors heard that he was chased down when he tried to escape and was once bundled into the boot of a car in Aberdeen before being taken back to Wales. In a victim impact statement, Hughes said: \u201cI feel like not only did they strip me from my early adult life but also moulded me into an unhappy man that felt worthless. They made me feel like I had nothing to live for. Every time I felt some sort of happiness they tried to crush it. \u201cI detest the way they treated me. I\u2019ve had counselling to overcome the pain I suffered. I\u2019m now starting to believe in myself for the first time in a long time. I plan to continue to improve my life and be the happy person I am now.\u201d The second man, only named as K for legal reasons, had been frightened into submission for six years and was kidnapped at least four times after trying to escape. In his victim impact statement, K said: \u201cI kept things bottled up inside and resorted to cannabis and alcohol to block everything out. I was angry at the authorities who did nothing and at myself for getting sucked into this situation.  \u201cIt was only in the past couple of years I realised there was such a thing as modern slavery in this country and it shouldn\u2019t be happening.  \u201cI\u2019ve been receiving treatment for post traumatic stress disorder. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with a collapsed vertebra and osteoporosis, which is attributed to malnutrition. I intend to soldier on and don\u2019t want people to feel sorry for me. I\u2019m taking one step at a time. I want to get on with the rest of my life without looking over my shoulder.\u201d Patrick Joseph, 59, Patrick Dean, 39, and William Connors, 36, all from Cardiff, were convicted of requiring Hughes to perform forced or compulsory labour. Patrick Joseph Connors was also found guilty of causing actual bodily harm, kidnap and conspiracy to kidnap. Carbis, 34, of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, was cleared of the compulsory labour charge but found guilty of kidnapping K. Catrin Evans, head of the Welsh Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s complex casework unit, said: \u201cToday\u2019s convictions are a direct result of the immense courage both victims have shown in coming forward to report what happened. \u201cThe criminal justice system cannot undo what has happened to them, nor give them back the years they have lost, but we hope that these convictions will give them some measure of assistance as they continue to rebuild their lives.\u201d Outside court, Hughes said: \u201cI am so happy to have my life back \u2013 a life that I never knew existed. With the help and support of my family, I am now re-building my life. \u201cThose people stole my life but the outcome of today\u2019s trial means that they will now face the justice that they deserve.\u201d   Patrick Joseph Connors was jailed for 14 years. Patrick Dean Connors was given six and a half years in prison while William Connors was jailed for four years and Carbis for two and a half years.  Judge Neil Bidder said the victims had been treated like serfs in \u201cmodern-day slavery\u201d, adding: \u201cK described himself as subject to invisible shackles. Michael Hughes felt degraded like an item of property. You diminished what little self respect they had.\u201d",
