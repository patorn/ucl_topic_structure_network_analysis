So when it was revealed this week that Facebook board member Peter Thiel had been secretly bankrolling a lawsuit to inflict financial ruin on the news and gossip site Gawker, Silicon Valley cheered. The investor Vinod Khosla wrote on Twitter that the \u201cpress gets very uppity when challenged\u201d. And that these bad journalists need \u201cto be taught lessons\u201d. Khosla has suffered a great deal of negative press since buying a beachfront community and blocking off public access to the historic surfing beach, an illegal move that has garnered him unflattering stories in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times \u2013 a news organization that Khosla says also does \u201cclickbait journalism\u201d and deserves some \u201clessons\u201d as well. Investor and bellicose Silicon Valley personality Jason Calacanis wrote that, though he disagrees with Thiel on some things, in this fight against Gawker, Thiel \u201cis a hero, 100% in the right fighting against evil\u201d. Shark Tank TV show host and Twitter investor Chris Sacca wrote: \u201cMy one regret is that [a Valleywag writer at the time] isn\u2019t personally liable for any of that money owed.\u201d Each of these investors \u2013 and many of those writing in a wave of local support for Thiel \u2013 add caveats that they\u2019re happy to see \u201cclickbait\u201d or \u201cgossip\u201d journalists suffer but that they fully support \u201creal\u201d journalists. As Khosla made clear by putting the New York Times on the side of clickbait, many Silicon Valley investors see most press as suspect.  After six years as a reporter in Silicon Valley, I\u2019ve found that a tech mogul will generally call anything unflattering I write \u201cclickbait\u201d and anything flattering \u201cfinally some real journalism\u201d. A macabre parlor game among reporters here now is to guess which billionaire will, as Thiel did, wait 10 years with a grudge before seizing an opportunity to bankrupt you and exact maximum revenge. It\u2019s a paranoia that seems more fitting for reporters covering characters like Vladimir Putin than the latest startup. In America today, almost no one wields the concentrated wealth and power that the new rulers of Silicon Valley have. As the prodigies grow up, they\u2019re realizing just how much they can flex that power.  To be fair, by no means is everyone supporting Thiel. Pierre Omidyar, eBay founder, is now backing Gawker\u2019s appeal, launching what looks like will become a proxy war. \u201cFirst Look Media is looking into organizing amicus support for Gawker in its legal fight and appeal against Hulk Hogan,\u201d Lynn Oberlander, First Look\u2019s general counsel, told the New York Post. Jason Mandell, co-founder of the startup PR firm LaunchSquad, whose client list includes Facebook, Coursera and Munchery, said he thought Silicon Valley generally had a healthy relationship with the tech press, less so with the broader press.  \u201cPeople like Peter Thiel are used to being able to tell an engineer \u2018this is broken \u2013 fix it\u2019,\u201d Mandell said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the unique dynamic between the press and the public. They don\u2019t understand the first amendment and free speech as it relates to the media.\u201d \u201cTech guys love tech reporters because they\u2019re often rooting for them to succeed but when reporters go off that script and do something that\u2019s more combative I think it\u2019s jarring.\u201d Mandell said there\u2019s a \u201cunique relationship\u201d between tech entrepreneurs and the press because while other industries might be doing bad things, Silicon Valley thinks it is doing good for the world.  \u201cEverybody here is part of this revolution and everyone agrees it\u2019s a good thing in general. People want Tesla to succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re covering finance you can\u2019t be enamored with the CEO with Bank of America \u2026 But aside from companies like Uber, what companies in our world are doing bad things?\u201d",
