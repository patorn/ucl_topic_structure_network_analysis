  "body": "Supporters of Germany\u2019s anti-immigration movement Pegida have expressed outrage that the blue-eyed blond boys on the packaging of Kinder chocolate bars are being replaced by children of African and Middle Eastern appearance \u2013 seemingly unaware that they are childhood photographs of players in their own national football team. A photograph of two boxes of the chocolate bar \u2013 one carrying a childhood portrait of Gelsenkirchen-born midfielder Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, the other of Berlin-born defender J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng \u2013 were shared last week on the Facebook page of the Bodensee branch of the anti-refugee protest movement. \u201cThey don\u2019t stop at anything,\u201d said the original post. \u201cCan you really buy them like that, or is that a joke?\u201d Another commenter wrote: \u201cSurely that\u2019s a fake?!???\u201d   Related: Pegida: what does the German far-right movement actually stand for?    \u201cThey are really trying to trick us into accepting every kind of rubbish as normal, poor Germany,\u201d said another post.  Others called for a boycott of the chocolate bars, which are produced by the Italian manufacturer Ferrero. One wrote: \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t be buying it any more.\u201d Some commenters tried to draw attention to the fact that the packaging was only a marketing stunt designed to tie the product in with the upcoming European Football Championship in France. \u201cDear folks, firstly Ferrero is an Italian manufacturer, and secondly, where do think they get the cocoa from to make the chocolate with?\u201d said one.  But many of Pegida\u2019s supporters evidently felt discomfited by non-white players representing Germany at football internationals. \u201cYou mean \u2018die Mannschaft\u2019 [a nickname for the German team]? There\u2019s nothing national about them any more.\u201d \u201cThese are gladiators \u2013 therefore slaves \u2013 who don\u2019t play for Germany out of conviction, but only for the money.\u201d Pegida\u2019s name is an abbreviation for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West.   Related: Bastian Schweinsteiger included in Germany\u2019s provisional Euro 2016 squad    Ferrero has now commented on the story, which has been widely covered on German news websites, saying in a statement on its Facebook page: \u201cFerrero would like to expressly distance itself from all kinds of xenophobia and discrimination.\u201d Until 2011, Germany internationals featured in a series of ads for the cocoa spread Nutella, also produced by Ferrero. Because many players featured in the ads saw their international careers nosedive soon after, the tie-in became colloquially known as the \u201cNutella curse\u201d. Of the players featured on the special-edition Kinder chocolates, at least two \u2013 G\u00fcndogan and Leverkusen midfielder Christoph Kramer \u2013 will miss out on this year\u2019s tournament due to injury or non-selection.",
