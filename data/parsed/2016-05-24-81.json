Officers from the UK this week met their French counterparts to finalise planning for the tournament, the build-up to which has been beset by security concerns. Assistant chief constable Mark Roberts, the lead for football policing in the UK, said that between 350,000 and 500,000 fans were now expected to travel to follow England, Northern Ireland and Wales. There are also expected to be large contingents of travelling fans from elsewhere, with 500,000 expected from Germany alone. \u201cThe clear message was, if you don\u2019t have tickets for the England v Wales, don\u2019t come to Lens. The stadium has a capacity of 35,000, the fanzone has a capacity of 10,000 and, without being unkind, there\u2019s not a lot else to do in Lens,\u201d he said. Fans will instead be urged to head for Lille or remain elsewhere in France where fanzones will be better able to cope with large numbers. Roberts said: \u201cIf you\u2019ve not got a ticket, don\u2019t go to Lens. Go to Lille instead, where there\u2019s a bigger fanzone. We know Brits will get where water can\u2019t in terms of sporting events but people will not get in stadiums without a ticket. If you\u2019ve not got a ticket, don\u2019t travel.\u201d He said the French police, planning a security operation on an \u201cextraordinary scale\u201d in the wake of last year\u2019s terror attacks in Paris, would stop cars on their way into the city and shuttle fans to the stadium on buses. Alcohol will be banned for 24 hours on the day of the game and all those entering the city will be searched. For the first time UK officers will flow intelligence information back to the UK and monitor social media in an attempt to stop anyone suspected of an offence returning to France. \u201cIf there are any incidents of disorder or antisocial behaviour during the tournament, officers in France and the UK will be gathering intelligence to identify those supporters,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cThis could result in them being subject to a football banning order on their return to the UK as well as potentially being charged for an offence in France.\u201d Incidents such as the racist abuse aimed at a commuter on the Paris M\u00e9tro by Chelsea fans were cited as examples of the sort of behaviour that could lead to an immediate banning order on return to the UK. But Roberts stressed that England fans had behaved well at recent tournaments and that banning orders, of which 1,929 are currently in place, that require individuals to surrender their passports for the duration of the tournament had helped reduce the possibility of disorder. While UK police have sought at other recent tournaments to reassure the local police that England fans no longer deserved a negative reputation, he said that at Euro 2016 fans would also have to be prepared to see military police and put up with a heavy presence given the security risk. England\u2019s opening game with Russia in Marseille is considered to be a potentially combustible mix in light of incidents during the 1998 World Cup in the city and the reputation of some Russian fans. While Roberts cautioned against allowing \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d to stoke up tension, he said that French and UK police were both well aware of the risks. \u201cMarseille commanders are well aware of the intelligence briefing we\u2019ve received. We are aware of some elements of the Russian supporter base in terms of their background. Police are also aware of the local elements,\u201d he said.",
