  "body": "The traditional image of the office temp was not a favourable one. For years, anyone choosing to work this way had to accept a place in the office hierarchy on par with the interns, and the indignity of being referred to as \u201cwhatsherface who\u2019s covering for Angie from accounts while she\u2019s on honeymoon\u201d. Fortunately those attitudes are on the decline, and today millions of people are choosing to build a career out of temporary, or contract, working. While the concept of short-term or project-based work is not new, the way it is viewed, both by workers and employers, has changed radically in the past decade. Just as more skilled and successful professionals are choosing to work this way, so employers are increasingly seeing temporary workers not as a stop-gap but as \u201ctalent on demand\u201d \u2013 a kind of Netflix for the labour force. The reinvention of work The speed and scale of the switch means the comparison with Netflix isn\u2019t so outlandish. A decade ago, barely 10% of the workforce worked as temps or contract staff. Yet a recent study by the supply management firm Ardent Partners concluded that temporary workers now make up a third of the average company\u2019s work force, and predicted that in a few years they will account for more than 50%. In sectors such as construction \u2013 where employers often need the flexibility to dial up or down the size of their workforce \u2013 the vast majority of workers are already self-employed or on temporary contracts. And in all sectors the use of temporary contracts is on the rise.  Temp work is no longer a necessity of the recession Many of this fast-growing army of temporary workers and self-employed people made the switch to non-traditional careers during the last recession. Initially this was driven by necessity. Companies that were hit by falling revenues began laying off permanent staff, and became reluctant to hire others on a permanent basis. So with more people looking for work and fewer permanent roles available, the most talented and enterprising began to find other ways of working \u2013 setting themselves up as their own boss and pitching for short-term assignments. As the economy began to pick up, those with in-demand skills like technology and IT found themselves spoilt for choice as employers in these sectors ceased to recruit for permanent positions, and instead competed to attract specialists on a temporary basis. Soon this type of work became not just flexible, but also highly lucrative. Today talented contractors will often work on several projects \u2013 for multiple employers \u2013 in a year. As well as giving them the freedom to take long holidays between contracts, this way of working can also offer them more flexibility in terms of choosing their own hours \u2013 to fit around childcare commitments and so on. There are some attractive tax breaks for the self-employed too, and white collar contractors working for most larger companies tend to earn good money compared to national averages. For example, Elevate\u2019s data shows that a typical IT contractor working in London or south-east England charges an average of around \u00a3440 per day. However, not everyone working in temporary jobs haschosen to do so. Many low-skilled workers in the industrial sector have little choice but to accept very short-term or zero-hours contracts. There is a two-tier market hidden behind the statistics.   Related: Taking the leap: top tips for becoming self-employed    Thinking of making the switch? Flexibility is your friend If you have a saleable skill and are thinking of going solo, remember that flexibility is key. If you\u2019re willing to make yourself available over the weekend to help an employer out in a crisis, or to put a longterm project on hold to deal with an urgent issue, you will make yourself especially valuable. If you consistently meet deadlines, most employers are likely to show more flexibility in the way they treat you \u2013 both in the hours you work or where they let you work. Skilled contractors are among the best placed to capitalise on the broader move towards virtual working. With computers and videoconferencing making it possible for people to work from anywhere, at any time, no wonder many employers have come to appreciate flexible working. If contractors\u2019 appeal to employers lies in their skill and their flexibility, technology that enables them to work or solve problems remotely only makes them more flexible \u2013 and thus more attractive. For the millions of skilled professionals working this way, the stigma of the term temp is gone, as is the idea of being a mere substitute for a permanent member of staff. Instead a new generation of contract workers is choosing to strike out on their own \u2013 selling their services where they\u2019re needed and enjoying the freedom, and tax perks, of being their own boss. All this is a long way from the days of the lowly temp struggling to fill in until Angie comes back from her honeymoon, or the desperation of those laid off in the recession. New technology and shifting working patterns mean that for many, a career built on temporary work is now a lifestyle choice, not a last resort.
