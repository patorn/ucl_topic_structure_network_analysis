They\u2019d lost that battle with the word,believing too much better left unsaidto the likes of me and not those palsnow threescore and ten years dead. How many old soldiers does it taketo change a lightbulb? asked one.You can\u2019t know if you weren\u2019t there!They all fell about. Now they\u2019d won. Relaxed, they began letting it outinto grey shades of afternoon light,into words they feared betrayed it.And I learned why they were right.  Poem taken from The Blind Road-Maker by Ian Duhig, published by Picador at \u00a39.99         Related: The Blind Road-Maker by Ian Duhig review \u2013 songs of the forgotten and voiceless     Enabling \u201cthe excluded to claim a home in the language\u201d is how Ben Wilkinson reads Ian Duhig\u2019s strategy in his latest collection, The Blind Road-Maker. The cast includes the genius road-builder himself, Jack Metcalf; \u201cThe Blue Queen of Ashtrayland,\u201d Molly (see Bernard Hare\u2019s Urban Grimshaw and the Shed Crew) and the Angolan asylum seeker, Manuel Bravo. Bravo\u2019s tragedy is memorialised in the powerful poem The Full Weight of the Law, posted by Duhig last August on Billy Mills\u2019s Poster poems. Duhig, like his fellow Loiner Tony Harrison, is a splendid and sometimes splenetic poetic documentary-maker; a restrainedly didactic writer with an auto-didact\u2019s passion for knowledge. He has an inspiring awareness that such knowledge is a form of conscience: it involves morality. He\u2019s a very clever poet but, like all the best teachers, he doesn\u2019t ask us to admire him \u2013 he asks us to learn with him.  In Combat Gnosticism, it is the poet-teacher persona whose voice we mostly hear, meditating after one of those occasions when the day job has meant enabling unheard voices \u2013 in this case, war veterans in a workshop run by Age Concern. The war in question must be the second world war, since the survivors\u2019 pals are \u201cthree score and ten years dead\u201d. But the first world war is also strongly alluded to.  Combat Gnosticism is used by the writer and critic James Campbell to describe the claim or assumption made by some war poets and critics, such as Paul Fussell, that physical participation in conflict provides a unique order of experience and knowledge, one inaccessible and incommunicable to those outside it, including non-combatants, civilians and women. The argument against this theory of gnosis is set out in Campbell\u2019s essay: Combat Gnosticism: The Ideology of First World War Poetry Criticism. The ideology of what Campbell calls the \u201ctrench lyric\u201d is replicated, he argues, in criticism which embodies the same ideological and aesthetic criteria, and therefore can\u2019t move to an objective position outside the frame. In fact, it aspires to become the \u201cprose trench lyric\u201d. Maybe a good deal of traditional poetry criticism appeals to the concept of gnosis, and is thereby at risk from becoming an insufficiently critical part of what\u2019s criticised?   But back to the poetry workshop and the old soldiers: combat gnostics to men deeply reluctant to write their own war poems. We\u2019re not told in direct speech what the veterans say, beyond the lightbulb joke proposed by one of them that elicits a lot of laughter \u2013 \u201cThey all fell about\u201d. It is poetically strangely effective \u2013 defamiliarised to the extent of seeming bizarre, as well as defensive, and painfully self-mocking: \u201cHow many old soldiers does it take to change a lightbulb?\u201d Is war \u2013 or faith in the uses of war \u2013 the lightbulb? Who can ever change it, if not the soldiers?  In this miniature battle, the poet loses and has to be guided by those who instinctively shy away from the home in the language offered them: \u201cThey believed too much better left unsaid.\u201d They had lost their audience, for one thing \u2013 those who had experienced the same combat and who might have formed the one true readership.  So it appears that combat experience is an order of knowledge which guarantees both the writing of war poetry and the reading. As the poem progresses mutedly and bluntly to its conclusion, the tone seems to blend with the \u201cgrey shades of afternoon light\u201d \u2013 shades that might be those of dead infantrymen, grey as in old war footage, grey as memories eventually become. The old men fear their words betray the experience: the risk is not that they expose it, but that the exposure will be false.   The poet doesn\u2019t quote any poem or phrase that might have been written after the joke has bonded his group. It\u2019s possible that the words the men eventually found were not equal to their experience. Perhaps they needed better words and the last line includes a wry reflection of the fact. Or perhaps no one\u2019s words are good enough, and that is what the speaker sees in his last forlorn epiphany: \u201cRelaxed, they began letting it out / into grey shades of afternoon light / into words they feared betrayed it / And I learned why they were right.\u201d  The issue, then, is not simply authenticity, but humility. The war vets may not be poets but they understand that language needs to measure up to the lived experience. However faltering their technique, they know, as poets do, the betrayals \u2013 the lies and prettification \u2013 words can commit, despite the poets \u201cbeing there\u201d. The genuine poet refrains from challenging or correcting them; he defends the necessary silence.",
