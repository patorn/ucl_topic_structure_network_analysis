The 1,200 inmates of the west London jail have been locked in their cells and all visits have been cancelled as a result of the action by prison officers. Laura Janes, the legal director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, tweeted: \u201cCannot get into Wormwood Scrubs to represent young person who does not feel safe as staff have walked out because staff don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d    Another photo from Wormwood Scrubs.

There is no danger to staff or the wider public.\u201d The Prison Officers Association said the health and safety concerns followed a recent spate of incidents at the Victorian prison. Mike Rolfe, of the POA, said there had been a number of assaults on staff, and packages of \u201clegal highs\u201d were said to have been thrown over the perimeter walls.

There are concerns for health and safety of staff, and they have decided to stay outside until they can seek assurances from management that their concerns will be addressed,\u201d Rolfe said. He said about 50 staff were outside the prison.  \u201cStaff have said that if there\u2019s an emergency inside the prison, they will send teams in to deal with it.\u201d    Related: Ministers face an uphill battle to reform failing and decrepit jails | Erwin James    Rolfe said the action was not planned and followed an emergency branch meeting held on Friday. It has been illegal since 1997 for prison officers to take industrial action. The new chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, said in a report last month that half of prisoners surveyed at Wormwood Scrubs said they had felt unsafe at some point in their time there.  \u201cThe number of assaults on prisoners and staff was double that at similar prisons and at the time of the last inspection. We found prisoners who were too frightened to leave their cells and were not adequately supported by staff,\u201d the report said. The Prison Governors Association later said that their members were providing operational cover at the Scrubs to deliver the basic necessities such as meals, access to healthcare and dealing with emergencies. \u201cWe absolutely do not condone staff withdrawing their labour but we are aware of the concerns that have been raised, most recently in the chief inspector\u2019s report, within the prison. \u201cA constant theme is a shortage of staff and, notwithstanding that the national benchmark, which sets staffing levels, has not been implemented, we understand that staffing levels are an issue,\u201d said the PGA statement. The governors added that the longer the dispute runs and prison officers continue to refuse to enter the jail the more challenging it will be to continue to provide operational cover.",
