  "body": "Welcome to our column on podcasting. Here, we\u2019ll discuss great episodes and share new discoveries \u2013 and we hope you\u2019ll chip in with your own recommendations. Thanks for all your comments last week: we are listening, and we do know there are so many fantastic episodes, mainstream and not, that deserve to be featured. Give us time! In the meantime, keep them coming.  Reply All goes full Serial A female reporter\u2019s weekly phone calls with a jailed man who says he didn\u2019t commit the crime he\u2019s serving for. An incomprehensible crime and trial from the late 90s, dissected over months by an enthralled journalist. Sound familiar? That\u2019s because Reply All\u2019s miniseries has all the Serial ingredients (with some sprinkles of Fargo) \u2013 and we could not have enjoyed it more.  Over the past three episodes, producer Sruthi Pinnamaneni has told a story that started when she discovered a man had been writing a blog inside a maximum security prison, and she gave him a call ... then was hooked for a year. See minute 15:42:       It gets better, and darker \u2026 and Part III just dropped. Reply All tackles all the sides you didn\u2019t know the internet had \u2013 from the tragic to the hilarious, but always fascinating. This full-blown investigation proves it\u2019s the best podcast around.  \u2022 On the Inside, Parts I, II and III by Reply All (ep 64, 65 and 66)Duration: 30, 35, 50 minutesListen here / Subscribe hereCome for the \u201ccorrectional facility\u201d calls, stay for the investigative storytelling. Jeff Daniels sobers up The actor Jeff Daniels is best known for perfecting \u201ca particular brand of white American male that is not altogether likeable\u201d \u2013 see The Newsroom, The Squid and the Whale, Terms of Endearment \u2013 as well as mastering \u201clovingly stupid\u201d (Dumb and Dumber). What is probably less known is that, for the past 30 years, he has been working from his Michigan hometown \u2013 population 5,000. Daniel talks candidly about leaving New York for the Midwest, being so frustrated by the business that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t even watch the Oscars\u201d, and getting sober a second time around, having started drinking again after a decade of sobriety.   I had just turned 50, which is a speed bump \u2013 at 80 miles an hour. And I hadn\u2019t drank for 14 years, had quit cold turkey. I was two months into 50, and I was checking into a hotel room in some city, I\u2019m throwing the suitcase on the bed, and I hear a voice behind me \u2013 and it\u2019s me, clear as day \u2013 say: \u2018Don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve punished yourself enough?\u2019  Anna Sale masterfully creates a no-judgment safe space for interviewees to open up about \u201cthe things we think about a lot and need to talk about more\u201d \u2013 and addiction is one of them:   In acting, we call it \u201cfire the judge\u201d. It\u2019s the devil on your shoulder. It\u2019s the judge where you go out on stage and, right before you go into the big speech, that voice says \u201cyou\u2019re going to screw this up.\u201d You\u2019ve got to fire him. And I didn\u2019t fire him that day.  Here\u2019s a teaser:     Click to play a teaser for the episode.   \u2022 How Jeff Daniels Got Sober, Again by Death, Sex & Money Duration: 24 minutesListen here / Subscribe hereCome for Sale\u2019s soothing voice, stay for the confessions. Joanna Newsom in the garage She\u2019s so fantastically alien when she sings and plays that it almost feels wrong to hear songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and actor Newsom talk like the rest of us. But she\u2019s great company, it turns out. Marc Maron, as most podcast fans will know, interviews guests in his garage in an honest, conversational manner that often results in really intimate chats. Here, Newsom describes her childhood in Nevada City (as hippy a town as Californian towns get), her obsessive harp-playing as a teenager, Renaissance paintings, and her preoccupation with permanence and \u201cwhat it actually means to be remembered \u2013 which is basically to say death\u201d.  \u2022 Joanna Newsom by WTF with Marc Maron (ep 709)Duration: 85 minutesListen here / Subscribe hereCome for the great company, stay for the life and death reflections.",
