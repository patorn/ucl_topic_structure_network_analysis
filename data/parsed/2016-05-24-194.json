  "body": "Mrs \u2019Arris Goes to Paris is a 1958 novel by Paul Gallico in which a London charlady dreams of owning a Dior dress. It\u2019s unashamedly sentimental and not a little preposterous, but writer Rachel Wagstaff and composer/lyricist Richard Taylor have succeeded in transforming this ration-era fairytale into one of the most heartwarming and tear-forming British musicals of recent years.    Related: Song-and-dance man Daniel Evans is a great creative choice for Chichester    It commands attention because Taylor\u2019s score combines accessible tunes with operatic complexity, while Wagstaff throws just enough common obstacles in the way to keep Mrs Harris\u2019s door-to-Dior journey a reality. Having scraped together sufficient funds to acquire the gown, she fails to allow for import duty and shortfalls in the exchange rate. The scene at the border is a classic: asked if she has anything to declare, Mrs Harris replies that she has a custom-fitted Dior frock worth a year\u2019s wages in her luggage. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Winston Churchill,\u201d the customs official smiles, waving her through.  Daniel Evans\u2019s final production as artistic director of the Crucible is a perfect fillip for a new age of austerity and features some fine comedy as Clare Burt\u2019s indomitable femme de m\u00e9nage melts the froideur of the staff on the Avenue Montaigne. It also looks absolutely ravishing as designer Lez Brotherston takes full advantage of the licence to indulge in the scandalous extravagance of the New Look. Evans\u2019s tenure in Sheffield has been a rare luxury. It\u2019s only fitting that his parting gift should bear such a prestigious label. \u2022 At the Crucible theatre, Sheffield, until 4 June.
