  "body": "Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts? I strayed into a new job four months ago for a large public sector company. I\u2019m in a senior position (one step down from board). I have a proven track record in previous roles for delivery, communication and relationship skills. I was asked to design a restructure for the department I\u2019m head of, which I\u2019ve done. However, there is a single member of the board who is persistently challenging me and blocking my proposals. Everyone that I\u2019ve discussed my proposal with thinks it will really improve things. However, every meeting I\u2019ve scheduled with this particular person has been cancelled, hence I\u2019ve not been able to explain the structure and listen to any feedback as to why they think it\u2019s not quite right.  I\u2019m very happy to take on board any comments because I\u2019m keen to get the structure right but it\u2019s very challenging when the only contact is via terse intermittent email or critical comments fed back via my line manager. Otherwise, the job is great and I have a phenomenal team who are passionate about doing a job and getting things right to support the organisation. I\u2019ve tried everything I know to get this relationship to a professional working one, but the last straw was an undermining comment questioning my skills and ability at a meeting with the other execs, which I was not present at \u2013 my manager fed back to me in a phone call. Incidentally, my manager has never questioned my ability or performance during my first three months but as the two of them work very closely I\u2019m concerned this could easily spiral into a performance management issue. The two of them have caused the three previous incumbents in my role to leave over the last five years. Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy\u2019s and readers\u2019 help, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com. Please note that he is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or to reply personally.",
