Related: Hillary Clinton: Trump presidency will put 'kids at risk of violence and bigotry'    For months, Hillary Clinton has slammed her opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders, for supporting a 2005 federal law that bars lawsuits against gun companies when their products are misused by criminals.  On Saturday, at the annual meeting of NRA members in Louisville, Kentucky, the NRA\u2019s chief lobbyist played a clip of a response from the Vermont senator.  During a March debate in Michigan, Sanders said: \u201cIf you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer of that gun liable?  \u201cIf they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you\u2019re really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America. I don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d  A hall full of NRA members gave the clip a smattering of applause. To laughter, Chris Cox, head of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, said: \u201cI don\u2019t say this often \u2026 OK, fine, I\u2019ve never said it. But Bernie\u2019s right.  \u201cHolding gun manufacturers liable for the acts of madmen and terrorists will put them out of business overnight.\u201d Cox said Clinton\u2019s support of lawsuits against gun companies was a \u201cbackdoor\u201d attempt to ban guns by \u201csuing gun manufacturers into bankruptcy\u201d. Earlier this year, Sanders suggested that a lawsuit against the companies that sold a gun used in the 2012 Newtown school shooting was \u201ca backdoor way\u201d to ban assault weapons.  Family members of the 20 children and six adults who died at Sandy Hook elementary school are suing the manufacturer, distributor and dealer of the military-style Bushmaster rifle that was used. Lawyers for the families argue the companies were negligent in selling a dangerous weapon to the general public, and that macho advertising may be designed to target insecure, powerless young men.  The gun companies in the suit say that they are protected by the 2005 federal shield law that Sanders supported, and that the Sandy Hook tragedy had nothing to do with the type of weapon used, which was legally purchased by the gunman\u2019s mother.  The Clinton campaign has highlighted the case, and she has won endorsement from some family members of victims from Sandy Hook victims and other mass shootings.

Whether the case can move forward despite the federal shield law will be decided in October.  Sanders backed off from his support of the 2005 shield law earlier this year, with his campaign saying he would now support a repeal. But as Clinton and some family members of Sandy Hook victims have criticized his stance on the gun industry, he has repeated his support for the central tenet of the law: that gun companies should not be held responsible if they sell a gun lawfully and it is later used in a crime.  Cox told NRA members that Clinton\u2019s support for lawsuits against gun companies had nothing to do with safety \u201cand everything to do with banning your guns\u201d. \u201cWhen a criminal knocks out a convenience store clerk with a baseball bat, you don\u2019t sue Louisville Slugger,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhen a terrorist shoots dozens of people in San Bernardino, or a deranged monster slaughters school children, well \u2013 according to Hillary, that\u2019s the gun manufacturer\u2019s fault and they ought to be sued for it. This has absolutely nothing to do with keeping anyone safer, anywhere, and everything to do with banning your guns.  \u201cThey want to create an illusion that they\u2019re keeping us safe.\u201d The Obama administration should simply \u201ctake every felon with a gun, drug dealer with a gun and criminal gang member with a gun off the streets right this minute and lock them up for five years or more\u201d, Cox said.  Instead, he said, Obama \u201csits back and does nothing so he can exploit the carnage\u201d.  After the March debate, in a tweet that Clinton supporters shared gleefully, the NRA expressed its support for Sanders\u2019 claim that lawsuits would bankrupt the gun industry.  In response to criticism, Sanders\u2019 campaign has repeatedly touted the candidate\u2019s \u201cwell-deserved D-minus rating from the NRA\u201d.   Related: Donald Trump endorsed by NRA despite history of gun control support    On Friday, as he accepted the NRA\u2019s endorsement, Trump encouraged Sanders to run as an independent if he lost the Democratic nomination to Clinton.  \u201cI think Bernie should run as an independent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want him to run as an independent. Then it would be the three of us on stage. I would love that.\u201d \u201cBernie Sanders is a good man,\u201d Arnald Harrison, 51, an NRA member from Schererville, Indiana, said on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that he\u2019s a liberal.\u201d  In a speech to members on Saturday, the NRA\u2019s executive vice-president echoed a different strain of Sanders\u2019 criticisms of Clinton \u2013 her \u201csix-figure speeches\u201d to Goldman Sachs.  Wayne LaPierre said: \u201cWhen the political elites paved our way for Wall Street get-rich schemes and crashed our economy and there\u2019s nowhere for you to work [and] there\u2019s no money for police and the schools in our country are a disaster, they tell you: you\u2019re on your own.\u201d  The NRA refused to issue Guardian US with accreditation for its annual convention.
