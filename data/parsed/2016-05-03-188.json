  "body": "The northern hemisphere will be hoping for warmer weather ahead with the arrival of May. For the southern hemisphere the new month signals the last few weeks of autumn as preparations are made for the winter months ahead. So what sort of wildlife will we all discover on our doorsteps? We\u2019d like to see your photos of the May wildlife near you. Share your photos and videos with us and we\u2019ll feature our favourites on the Guardian site. You can share your May wildlife photos, videos and stories with us by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 buttons. Or if you\u2019re out and about you can look for our assignments in the new Guardian app.  GuardianWitness is the home of readers\u2019 content on the Guardian. Contribute your video, pictures and stories, and browse news, reviews and creations submitted by others. Posts will be reviewed prior to publication on GuardianWitness, and the best pieces will feature on the Guardian site.",
