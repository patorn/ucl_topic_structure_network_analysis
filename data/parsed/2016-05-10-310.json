  "body": "Kevin Eastman, co-creator I\u2019d been drawing comics since school and was trying to sell my work to a newspaper. They didn\u2019t take it but said: \u201cYou should meet this guy Peter Laird \u2013 he draws the same kind of silly stuff.\u201d Even though he was eight years older, we had an immediate mind-meld. We formed a studio in 1983 and called it Mirage Studios because it wasn\u2019t really a studio. It was the living room in Peter\u2019s rented apartment. One night I said: \u201cIf Bruce Lee was an animal, what\u2019s the silliest animal he would be?\u201d It\u2019s an obvious joke: the fast-moving martial artist would be a slow-moving turtle. So I did a sketch that became Michelangelo: a turtle with a mask and nunchucks strapped to his arms. Peter laughed. I drew a logo that said \u201cNinja Turtles\u201d and Peter added \u201cTeenage Mutant\u201d.  After passing the page back and forth, we ended up with four turtles with four different weapons. We said: \u201cThis is the dumbest thing we\u2019ve seen in our lives.\u201d But we loved it, so we decided to come up with a story and self-publish it. When we were thinking of names, Renaissance artists just seemed to fit the silliness. I wanted to name one after the sculptor Bernini, but Peter suggested Donatello and that won the day.    It was a success all over the world except Japan, where ninjas would assassinate someone for a couple of coins    We premiered the first issue at a small comics convention in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in May 1984. It eventually sold 3,000 copies \u2013 a lot in the underground comics world. When we put out issue two the following January, we sold 15,000 copies. We worked out that would makes us $2,000 each pre-tax, so we could pay our rent, eat pizza and draw comic books for a living. It was the dream come true. By the time the opportunity came along to do toys, the cartoon and movies, we were selling 100,000 copies an issue. When the toys sold out in Christmas 1988, we assumed they\u2019d be in the bargain bins a few months later. But it just kept getting bigger. It was a success all over the world \u2013 except in Japan. Back then, \u201cninja\u201d was not a positive word in Japanese culture. Ninjas would assassinate someone for a couple of coins. It was like calling your product Teenage Mutant Murdering Turtles. That\u2019s why the UK version of the cartoon had the word \u201chero\u201d instead of \u201cninja\u201d in the title. I eventually sold my stake to Peter, and he sold the whole franchise to Viacom. We\u2019ve talked about getting together to write another Turtles story, but I think he\u2019s happy enjoying his free time and his family. In the early days, we\u2019d do signings and the kids would be excited, but the parents would have a look on their face that said: \u201cI\u2019ve spent so much money on these stupid Turtles and it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d Now, 30 years later, often the parent is really excited to meet you, as well as their child. It\u2019s an epic compliment.            David Wise, animated series writer Turning a black-and-white ninja comic into an animation was a challenge. You\u2019ve got to have action, but you\u2019re not allowed to show people hitting other people \u2013 it\u2019s not a good thing for impressionable young minds. But people beating up machines? No problem. So I made the enemy foot soldiers into robots so the Turtles could chop off arms and heads but we wouldn\u2019t get into trouble, since the attacks would just spark and zap and reveal metal underneath.    What I really liked was that it was colour-blind\u200b. They\u2019re male, but from an ethnic point of view, they\u2019re just turtles    After I finished writing the five-part pilot, I said to my boss: \u201cThis is either going to be the biggest disaster or the biggest hit in the history of children\u2019s television.\u201d It was so different and so nutty \u2013 and of course it was a huge international hit. But what I really liked was that it was colour-blind: they\u2019re male, but from an ethnic point of view, they\u2019re just turtles. So to see Asian and African American kids running around in Leonardo or Raphael costumes was fantastic. I worked on it for almost a decade, putting a lot of myself into the characters. But I haven\u2019t followed subsequent versions. Fans ask me: \u201cWhat did you think of the 2003 animated series?\u201d I just say: \u201cDude, I didn\u2019t watch it.\u201d I have no financial stake in it and if the writers did a worse job than me, I\u2019d be pissed off. And if they did a better job, I\u2019d be really pissed off.  \u2022 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is released on 30 May in the UK and on 3 June in the US.",
