  "body": "The New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption may be forced to conduct hearings in private and have its corruption findings set aside if sweeping changes suggested by the Icac inspector David Levine are adopted. On Thursday Levine released recommendations in a report that would limit the corruption watchdog\u2019s power. Levine has been exchanging barely concealed barbs with Icac commissioner Megan Latham for months over criticism of its investigations.   Related: Icac, the Car Crash: A Drama in Four Acts, starring Margaret Cunneen | Richard Ackland    The organisation, which can make findings of corruption against individuals, has faced particular scrutiny over an investigation into deputy senior NSW prosecutor Margaret Cunneen. Levine described Latham\u2019s statement about a high court hearing relating to Cunneen\u2019s case that took a narrow view of Icac\u2019s powers as a blustering statement by a \u201cpoor loser\u201d. Latham in turn described Levine\u2019s findings in that matter as \u201cdisconcerting\u201d. Levine\u2019s recommendations would subject Icac to more scrutiny from his office, introduce changes to when and how it could conduct public inquiries and set up mechanisms to allow public figures to \u201cexpunge\u201d findings by Icac when criminal convictions cannot be maintained. He wrote in the report: \u201cI have come to the view that the proceedings of Icac should be in private. That does not prevent the exposure of found corrupt conduct at the end of the investigation and the referral to prosecuting authorities. \u201cIt will prevent the undeserved trashing of reputations and will still permit a proper focus and a fairly managed forensic process, without the distraction of the temptation for flamboyance or theatre.\u201d   Related: The sound and fury of Icac: surely it can't get any more theatrical than this? | Richard Ackland    He recommended his own office should be a full-time position with a part-time inspector, and should be able to employ staff. The \u201cexoneration protocol\u201d set down by Levine would allow individuals to apply to the supreme court for an \u201cexpunging of the record\u201d in cases where Icac had made findings of corrupt conduct but a criminal prosecution could not be sustained. In a statement Icac said it would make a detailed response to the report, noting it had not been consulted by Levine before he wrote it.  \u201cThe inspector\u2019s \u2018principal recommendation\u2019, that the commission should conduct all examinations in private, is contrary to the considered conclusions reached by the 2005 Independent Review of the Icac conducted by Bruce McClintock SC and the more recent 2015 Independent Panel Review conducted by the Hon Murray Gleeson AC and Mr McClintock,\u201d it said.  \u201cThe Commission agrees with the Independent Panel Review\u2019s assessment that public inquiries \u201c\u2026 serve an important role in the disclosure of corrupt conduct [and] in disclosing the ICAC\u2019s investigative processes\u201d.",
