  "body": "Danish-based Dong Energy, a major investor in British offshore windfarms, is heading for the world\u2019s biggest stock market flotation so far this year with a price tag for the entire business of 106.5bn kroner (\u00a311bn). The group, which has been a flag carrier for companies moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy, expects to sell up to 17% of its shares, each priced between 200 and 255 kroner. The Copenhagen government, which owns 59% of Dong, said it wanted to retain a controlling half stake in a company that has invested in UK gas fields off the north of Scotland as well as windfarms such as London Array off the Kent coast.  The float, to be completed on 9 June, comes amid a 75% rise in the oil price since January lows, which has helped lift the share prices and pushed up the valuation of renewable energy suppliers such as Vestas Wind Systems in Denmark. Thomas Thune Andersen, Dong\u2019s chairman, said it was the right time to find new shareholders for a company that reported a 35% increase in first quarter profits last month. \u201cOver the past decade, Dong Energy has transformed itself. It is now a financially secure, fast-growing, profitable business with a leading position in the exciting offshore wind sector.  \u201cWe have built a strong and differentiated profile in renewable energy and made excellent progress towards becoming a leader among European energy companies in the transition to renewable energy. We look forward to welcoming new shareholders who can join us in our journey towards building a greener energy future.\u201d      Dong Energy\u2019s London Array windfarm off the Kent coast. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    Morten Imsgard, an analyst at Sydbank in Denmark, said the pricing was at the high end of his expectations. \u201cIt is a company that is relatively complex to value. Because it\u2019s crucial what expectations you have as an investor on the offshore wind turbine sector,\u201d he told news agency Ritzau. It is not the first time Dong has tried to tap stock market investors. Three previous efforts were abandoned amid indications the IPO would not be successful.   Related: British windfarms a boom for Danish firm    Dong, which was formed out of an oil and gas business plus a host of local Danish utilities, employs 700 people in Britain and has invested \u00a36bn in this country.  The company has said it will double this spending by 2020 through constructing projects such as the Hornsea Project One windfarm off the east Yorkshire coast. That would become the world\u2019s largest offshore windfarm once completed in 2020 with a capacity of 1.2GW. Each turbine will be 190 metres tall \u2013 larger than the Gherkin building in London. The selling off of Dong stock has not been universally popular in Denmark, with an earlier disposal of a 18% stake to US investment bank Goldman Sachs triggering the exit from a coalition government of the leftwing Socialist People\u2019s party. If the float is successful it should dwarf that of China\u2019s Zheshang bank, which raised $1.9bn (\u00a31.3bn). Henrik Poulsen, the Dong chief executive, said he had been \u201cencouraged by the positive feedback we have received so far in the process from the investors that we have seen around the world over the past couple of months\u201d. Elchin Mammadov, a utility analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the proposed share prices were based on different sectors of the business: \u201cThe lower range represents where European oil and gas companies are trading, while the higher range corresponds to where utilities are valued at the moment.\u201d Dong\u2019s profits from renewables were 3bn kroner, with 2bn kroner from oil and gas, plus 1bn kroner from the electricity grid system it operates in Denmark, the company reported last month. Earnings from renewables, mainly offshore wind, had risen by more than 50% but group profits were bolstered by almost 2bn kroner of disposals.",
