  "body": "Welcome to the end of week three of the political campaign. Only five to go! Yep, that\u2019s right, we\u2019re not even halfway through. Nowhere near. But we\u2019re still having fun, right? Think of all the gaffes and black holes still to come! To the headlines overnight and today: The big picture Readers will be aware of the backlash yesterday following comments made by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, midweek that linked Australia\u2019s suspension of live cattle exports with more asylum seeker boat arrivals.   Related: Australian election 2016: Labor focuses on Indigenous economy as David Feeney reportedly goes 'rogue' \u2013 politics live     I\u2019m just stating the bleeding obvious. You don\u2019t want to basically, what they would determine, insult another country by overnight ceasing the supply of a major requirement of their dietary intake, which is meat.  The Indonesian government rejected the comments and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, described Joyce\u2019s remarks as \u201cignorant,\u201d telling him to leave foreign policy \u201cto the grown ups\u201d. Well, Indonesia appears to have accepted the government\u2019s explanation of Joyce\u2019s comments following their damage control yesterday. That explanation, which came from several MP\u2019s including the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, the resources minister, Josh Frydenberg, and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was that Joyce was just highlighting the flaws in Labor\u2019s live export ban. The ABC reports:  In a one-line statement, a spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s foreign ministry said the comments from the prime minister and Ms Bishop were \u201cclear\u201d. Indonesia has issued no further response.  Calm has been restored, for now. All is not well, however, for the embattled Labor MP David Feeney. He dominated headlines last week for forgetting to declare a $2.3m negatively geared property he owns in the Melbourne on the parliamentary register of interests. Then, there was a car-crash interview with Sky News, after which he accidentally leaked some of Labor\u2019s campaign strategy. Now, according to the Australian, \u201cFeeney is copping internal flack for \u2018going rogue\u2019 in his \u00adMelbourne campaign to see off the Greens in Batman and ignoring party advice\u201d. The report says he \u201csurprised ALP insiders by using billboards featuring a giant image of himself\u201d.  One ALP source said personalising the campaign, as opposed to relying more heavily on the party\u2019s brand, had turned out to be a bad choice given the damage his standing had taken. The source said the billboards, which have the party name prominently displayed but feature a large reproduction of the MP\u2019s face, looked like something \u00ad\u201cproduced by a North Korean propaganda artist\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s been advised by us, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be taking it,\u2019\u2019 the party source said.     Feeney \u2018goes rogue\u2019 in ad https://t.co/lTaiL3EHje\u2014 Melissa Davey (@MelissaLDavey) May 26, 2016    According to the Australian\u2019s political editor, Dennis Shanahan, Thursday was Labor\u2019s worst day of the campaign so far. He writes:  With five weeks of campaigning to go, it\u2019s too early to say it\u2019s been a fatal day for Labor, but Bill Shorten can\u2019t afford too many more like this one. The real problem, beyond the embarrassing images and TV footage, is that structural, strategic flaws have been exposed and the focus remains firmly where the \u00adopposition doesn\u2019t want it. The political bonus handed to Labor by Tony Abbott\u2019s stringent 2014 budget and Labor\u2019s blockade of savings in the Senate has suddenly turned into a negative. After years of arguing for fairness over a suite of measures and calculating losses to families and pensioners, Labor was mugged by reality and its Senate intransig\u00adence. Only 48 hours after taking a huge risk in undermining the Coal\u00adition\u2019s economic credibility by over-egging the cost of Labor\u2019s promises, Scott Morrison was able to stand up yesterday and declare triumphantly he\u2019d \u201cflushed out\u201d Labor and forced more backflips than the Ringling Bros Circus.  With Joyce\u2019s comments, black hole estimate blunders and a potential diplomatic rift with Indonesia avoided, I\u2019d say the Coalition would be feeling pretty happy the end of the week is in sight as well. On the campaign trail   Related: Turnbull defends Indonesia in bid to hose down row over Joyce's comments    Bill Shorten is travelling to a remote Northern Territory community to announce $200m over four years to expand the Indigenous ranger program. The prime minister will be in Brisbane to discuss the government\u2019s plan to boost the Indigenous business sector. The campaign you should be watching With the PM there today, keep your eye on Brisbane. Teresa Gambaro (LNP), who is retiring at the election, with the seat held by a margin of 4.3%. According to Fairfax:  The lack of incumbency thanks to Teresa Gambaro\u2019s retirement has blown the battle for Brisbane open and led to an Australian political first \u2013 both major parties have preselected openly gay candidates. The lateness of Gambaro\u2019s announcement and Trevor Evans\u2019 subsequent preselection has given O\u2019Neill a strategically important headstart and has set up perhaps the most intriguing race in Queensland.  And another thing(s) Earlier this week we saw a poll that revealed Labor is gaining ground and Shorten is growing in popularity. Well, polls would only present a risk for Malcolm Turnbull should he be narrowly re-elected, writes Michelle Grattan for the Conversation. Polls are less damaging during an election campaign than in the period between elections, she says.  Polls have been a major factor in the revolving door of recent prime ministerial politics. They were central in the replacement of Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, and Tony Abbott. Malcolm Turnbull cited the Coalition losing 30 consecutive Newspolls when he launched his challenge. The polls give followers a real-time measurement of leaders\u2019 performances \u2013 or, to put it more accurately, how those performances are seen by the public at a given moment. The followers have become increasingly unwilling to tolerate leaders who, even if only in the short term, look like losers. Polls play to challengers who want to destabilise. Sometimes it is necessary and desirable to get rid of leaders, but continuous churn is destructive. If Turnbull wins this election with just a narrow majority his ability to govern strongly, and potentially his political life, will hang on the polls. He has plenty of enemies in his party, and their ammunition would be the polls, if they were poor. So for Turnbull this campaign is not only about winning. For him to be able to chart out bold policy in a second term, this has to be about winning well.  Some brutal honesty During the ABC\u2019s Kitchen Cabinet program on the ABC last night, the Independent senator Jacqui Lambi was asked by Annabel Crabb which politician she would most like to take on. While preparing some Tasmanian salmon, Lambie didn\u2019t miss a beat, replying, \u201c[Cory] Bernadi\u201d. Bernadi, she continued, was an \u201carsehole\u201d who had been \u201cborn with a silver spoon\u201d up his \u201crear end\u201d.
