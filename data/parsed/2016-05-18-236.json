  "body": "On International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, the governor of Texas had a message for the citizenry. \u201cJFK wanted to send a man to the moon. Obama wants to send a man to the women\u2019s restroom. We must get our country back on track,\u201d Greg Abbott tweeted on Tuesday morning, around the same time as the president issued a statement marking the event by underlining his government\u2019s commitment to \u201cadvancing the human rights of LGBT individuals\u201d. Texas officials have signaled that the state will be at the forefront of efforts to rebuff the Obama administration\u2019s promotion of transgender rights amid a series of political and legal skirmishes that alarm advocates and seem likely to send the issue to the US supreme court. \u201cWe have been swept up and are being used in a political game and a lot of fear-mongering is going on around our identity. It\u2019s not unlike the civil rights movement in the 60s around race but now the identity piece that\u2019s being used is gender identity,\u201d said Brandon Beck, a transgender man who is chair of the Transgender Education Network of Texas, an advocacy group. \u201cObama is turning bathrooms into courtroom issues,\u201d Abbott told delegates last week at the Texas GOP\u2019s state convention in Dallas. \u201cI want you to know, I am working with the governor of North Carolina, and we are going to fight back.\u201d   Related: North Carolina's transgender bathroom battle: what sparked it, and what's next    Pat McCrory, the Republican governor of North Carolina, signed a bill into law in March that stops local authorities introducing anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people. It was a riposte to an ordinance in Charlotte that let transgender people use public restrooms in line with their gender identity and requires individuals to use toilets based on the sex stated on their birth certificates. Last week the US justice department filed a civil rights lawsuit against North Carolina and the Obama administration issued non-legally binding guidance telling public schools to allow transgender students to use facilities that comport with their gender identity, among other assertions of their rights.     Greg Abbott: \u2018JFK wanted to send a man to the moon. Obama wants to send a man to the women\u2019s restroom. We must get our country back on track.\u2019 Photograph: LM Otero/AP    Arkansas\u2019s Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, issued a statement recommending that school districts ignore the guidelines, which he termed \u201cthe latest attempt at social engineering by the federal government\u201d. The 32-page platform adopted at the Texas GOP convention last weekend gives a strong indication that lawmakers will seek to pass a bill similar to North Carolina\u2019s when the legislature reconvenes in January. Several attempts failed in 2015, including a bill that proposed allowing students to sue school districts for $2,000 in compensation for \u201cmental anguish\u201d caused by bathroom or locker-room encounters with a transgender person of a different biological sex. The subject features amid such policy highlights as supporting the abolition of a dozen federal agencies, opposing the Census Bureau doing anything but counting the number of US citizens, and asserting that \u201c\u2018climate change\u2019 is a political agenda promoted to control every aspect of our lives\u201d. \u201cWe urge the enactment of legislation addressing individuals\u2019 use of bathrooms, showers and locker rooms that correspond with their biologically determined sex,\u201d the platform states. It adds that the Texas Republican party opposes \u201call policies and curriculum that teach alternate lifestyles including homosexuality, transgender and other non-traditional lifestyles as normal\u201d. It also calls on Abbott to overturn last summer\u2019s US supreme court ruling that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the country and maintains support for the widely discredited practice of \u201cconversion therapy\u201d for gay people. Despite the focus on the issue, Nathan Smith, director of public policy at the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, said that a flurry of new laws is unlikely in the short term because few state legislative bodies are in season for the remainder of this year and politicians are watching North Carolina to see how the legal action and economic boycotts play out. \u201cA lot of the really anti-trans rhetoric that we\u2019re hearing coming from the right isn\u2019t rooted in any sort of real problem that exists, it\u2019s more rooted in needing to rile up their base that they previously riled up with anti-marriage equality rhetoric,\u201d said Nathan Smith, director of public policy at the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.     Dan Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, said the state is willing to forfeit potentially billions of dollars in federal funding rather than institute the government\u2019s policy. Photograph: LM Otero/AP    \u201cAnd now that that debate has been settled by the supreme court they\u2019re looking for a new issue and I think that they\u2019ve found that in marginalising and victimising transgender people, who really at the end of the day just want to go to the bathroom.\u201d  Dan Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, said the state is willing to forfeit potentially billions of dollars in federal funding that provides free meals for underprivileged schoolchildren rather than institute the government\u2019s policy. About 0.3% of the US population is estimated to be transgender, which would equate to an average of three students in a school of 1,000. \u201cWell, in Texas, he can keep his 30 pieces of silver. We will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States,\u201d Patrick told reporters. It may not be an idle threat: citing his opposition to Obamacare, former governor Rick Perry turned down up to $100bn in federal funds over a decade that would have covered healthcare for about a million of Texas\u2019s working poor.  Last week, Patrick urged the Fort Worth schools superintendent to resign for backing a transgender student bathroom policy. He did not. On his Facebook page on Tuesday, Patrick termed the issue a \u201cmodern day \u2018come and take it\u2019 moment in Texas\u201d, alluding to the slogan used during the Texas revolution, and posting a restroom sign in place of the usual graphic of a cannon.  Abbott, a former state attorney general who likes to tout his record of frequently suing the Obama administration, seems to view the matter as a rallying cry for a conservative base that is smarting after Texas senator Ted Cruz\u2019s defeat by Donald Trump in the Republican presidential race. It fits the popular rightwing narrative of states fighting a tyrannical federal government \u2013 a theme that plays especially well in Texas. Fresh from writing to the retail giant, Target, to fret that their inclusive restroom policy could be a recipe for criminality, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, filed an amicus brief last week along with representatives from Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, Maine, North Carolina and Utah, in an appeal against a Virginia court\u2019s ruling in favour of a transgender student named Gavin Grimm who is seeking to use the boys\u2019 restroom at his school.

Conservatives scored a major victory last year when a campaign that centered on groundless safety claims persuaded Houston voters to reject a wide-ranging anti-discrimination ordinance that critics dubbed a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d. Oxford, a small city in Alabama, this month repealed a new ordinance that threatened to send transgender people to jail for using public restrooms that do not correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. A similar proposal from the mayor of Rockwall, near Dallas, failed to pass last month. \u201cThis is purely a security issue to me. These businesses are allowing men unrestricted access to women\u2019s restrooms or changing rooms based solely on their representation that they are more comfortable using the facilities for the opposite sex. I believe sexual predators will use this lax policy as an opportunity to come into contact with women and children in these isolated and, heretofore, private environments,\u201d the mayor, Jim Pruett, wrote in the Dallas Morning News on Tuesday.    It hurts to see that people are listening to these political pundits use this rhetoric against transgender people  Brandon Beck     But Beck, the advocate, is worried that it is transgender people who will be put at risk in the current hysterical climate. \u201cIt hurts to see that people are listening to these political pundits use this rhetoric against transgender people and to make us out to be some kind of freaks or monsters when we have not done anything wrong \u2013 and to act as if there aren\u2019t already laws on the books that stop sexual predators,\u201d he said.  Beck said he has seen evidence of increasing distrust and hostility towards transgender people on social media. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the murder rate is going to go up significantly,\u201d he said.  \u201cEven more than that, when we see this pervasive, systemic language around transgender people being \u2018wrong\u2019, it makes transgender people who are insecure in their identity or who are new to their identity internalise that transphobia and I think we\u2019re going to see suicide rates go up, too, especially for our younger generation.\u201d",
