  "body": "Ladbrokes and Coral could be forced to sell up to 400 betting shops if the \u00a32.3bn merger of the two bookmakers is to go ahead, the competition regulator has said.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the proposed merger between Britain\u2019s second and third largest betting shop chains would reduce choice for customers in \u201ca large number of local areas\u201d. Ladbrokes has more than 2,200 shops in the UK, while Coral has 1,850. A combination of the two companies would create Britain\u2019s largest bookmaker by number of shops, leapfrogging the market leader, William Hill, which has almost 2,400.  The CMA said the enlarged company might have to sell 350 to 400 shops to resolve concerns. Martin Cave, chairman of the CMA\u2019s inquiry into the deal, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve provisionally found that the merger between two of the largest bookmakers in the country may be expected to reduce competition and choice for customers in a large number of local areas. \u201cDiscounts and offers of free bets to individual customers are ways betting shops respond to local competition which could be threatened by the merger. We\u2019re also concerned that such a widespread potential reduction in competition at the local level could worsen those elements that are set nationally, such as odds and betting limits.\u201d Ladbrokes shares opened up 7% at about 128p on Friday morning after the CMA announcement, making the bookmaker the biggest early riser on the FTSE 250. A spokesman for Ladbrokes described the CMA\u2019s announcement as a significant step. He added: \u201cOur focus now will be agreeing the remedies with the CMA and finding the appropriate buyer or buyers for the shops.\u201d The CMA said it would consider responses to its provisional findings before reaching a final decision.  \u201cWe\u2019ll need to look closely at the exact number of shops and areas that would be involved \u2013 the overall size and complexity may mean that the sales need to be substantially completed before the merger can go ahead,\u201d Cave added. The CMA gave a deadline of 13 June for responses to the provisional findings.  If the deal goes ahead, it would be structured as a takeover of private-owned Coral by its bigger rival, the publicly listed Ladbrokes. The combined company would then apply to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange.",
