It was cheaper to construct entire buildings, alleys and courtyards in a back lot of a Swansea studio for a major TV drama set in post-war Paris than to film in actual French locations.  Selwyn Roberts, the Bafta award-winning producer, told the Guardian: \u201cIt would be millions of euros by the time you finished, whereas this is thousands \u2026 To lock off Paris streets would be prohibitively expensive.\u201d   His acclaimed productions include Parade\u2019s End, adapted by Sir Tom Stoppard and starring Benedict Cumberbatch, and Shackleton, with Sir Kenneth Branagh as the explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.  His latest production, called The Collection, is an eight-part television drama about an illustrious Paris fashion house emerging from the dark days of Nazi occupation. It is a family saga of rivalries, betrayals and \u201cugly secrets\u201d with an international cast that includes Frances de la Tour, the triple Olivier award-winner.  The production company is Lookout Point, which co-produced BBC1\u2019s highly acclaimed adaptation of War and Peace.  Walking along recreated Parisian pavements at Swansea Bay Studios, a former Ford car plant, Roberts pointed to \u201call the dressings you\u2019d find in 1947 Paris \u2026 a pissoir, a cinema, a boulangerie, a butcher, a cafe \u2026 side streets, a Metro station, everything \u2026 We built some incredible interior sets as well.\u201d     It was cheaper to construct entire buildings, alleys and courtyards in a back lot in a Swansea studio for a major drama set in post-war Paris than to film in actual French locations. Photograph: Nick Briggs     He described the set as \u201ctotally authentic\u201d, noting that extensive research was done to perfect the period look. The buildings have been made to look \u201cscuffed around\u201d by the war, he said.   Under production designer Alison Dominitz, a Welsh construction team and scenic artists created the set in two months. Timber and plywood structures were plastered to look like walls and brickwork and decorated. The road was laid with curb stones, cement and pebble stones while lamp-posts, street furniture and other props were \u201cdressed to bring the whole set alive\u201d, he said.  The Collection is the story of a fictional fashion house called The House of Sabine. The production notes state: \u201c[It] survived one devastating war, but another is looming, where personal battles and passionate love stories pit brother against brother, husband against wife, mother against daughter, prot\u00e9g\u00e9 against mentor.\u201d   The characters include a master designer, \u201ca charming, ruthless figure\u201d, his top model \u2013 \u201ca working-class, unconventional beauty who becomes the iconic face of the House of Sabine \u2026 and ultimately his captive\u201d \u2013 and his younger brother, \u201ca reckless hedonist\u201d.  De la Tour, a former Royal Shakespeare Company actor whose films include The History Boys and Harry Potter, plays a scheming matriarch. A cast from the UK, US and France includes Mamie Gummer \u2013 Meryl Streep\u2019s daughter who played Nancy Crozier in the hit US series The Good Wife \u2013 the Crossbones actor Richard Coyle; the Foyle\u2019s War lead Michael Kitchen and Tom Riley, whose films include Da Vinci\u2019s Demons \u2013 an international blockbuster that was also filmed at this Swansea studio. It also stars Jenna Thiam, who was in the hit French drama The Returned.     The Collection set. The TV drama is due to be completed in September. Photograph: Nick Briggs       The Anglo-French production has a large number of international partners. Amazon Prime has exclusive UK rights to the series, which is co-commissioned and distributed internationally by BBC Worldwide.  Their pursuit of authenticity was particularly challenged by the UK\u2019s smoking ban. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat hypocritical \u2026 I know how damaging tobacco it is\u2026 but, historically people did use tobacco \u2026 You\u2019re basically not telling the truth. We do have people smoking, but not excessively.\u201d  The film-makers\u2019 solution was to design \u201cspecial cigarettes that aren\u2019t cigarettes but special effects ones\u201d. He added: \u201cThey\u2019re very expensive to do because every one of them is a bespoke cigarette which has to have an electronic piece in it. It\u2019s like an e-cigarette with a special burning filter, so it looks like a proper cigarette.\u201d  The production is due to be completed in September and a release date is yet to be announced. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 May 2016. Because of an editing error, an earlier version lost the text \u201c, and Shackleton,\u201d from a sentence, changing its meaning.",
