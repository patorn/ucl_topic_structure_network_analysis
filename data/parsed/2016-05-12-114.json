  "body": "\u201cInterspecies love is in the air!\u201d enthuses one movie fansite at the prospect of the forthcoming Warcraft movie. There\u2019s a lot to get up to speed with in Warcraft. The original video games were so wildly popular that their community of players exceeds the population of Norway, and the World of Warcraft wiki has over 100,000 pages. For novices, it\u2019s a fantasy world not far removed from Lord of the Rings or Dungeons and Dragons: a realm of elves, dwarves, mythical creatures and medieval weaponry. Warcraft the movie revolves around Azeroth, a kingdom apparently ruled by European humans. Azeroth is invaded by orcs: hulking, relatively primitive ogres with overdeveloped lower canines. Rather than open arms, Azeroth greets these refugee orcs with medieval arms. \u201cThey\u2019re beasts. They should all be destroyed,\u201d says one character. It\u2019s essentially a race war, although the battle lines are by no means cut and dried, so there\u2019s still room for a bit of interspecies love.   Related: Oscar nominees weigh in on lack of diversity: 'there\u2019s an elephant in the room'    Warcraft\u2019s most interesting character looks to be Garona Halforcen, a half-human, half-orc and a green-skinned, kick-ass assassin. \u201cGarona is at the heart of our story, the heart of everything,\u201d director Duncan Jones has said. \u201cGarona is the bridging element between two cultures that have never met and are meeting for the first time.\u201d She is played, with prosthetic fangs and green body paint, by Paula Patton, an actor of African-American and European descent. A romance with the hero of the piece, a goodly Caucasian knight played by newcomer Travis Fimmel, is more than hinted at in the trailer.         Watch a trailer for Warcraft here.    Looking back over recent sci-fi/fantasy movies, there\u2019s a curious pattern starting to emerge. Think back to Guardians of the Galaxy. There, the heroine of the piece was a green-skinned female alien named Gamora, who also had a romantic relationship with the white male hero. Gamora was played by Zoe Saldana, an actor of Caribbean and African descent. Then there was Avatar, where the heroine was a blue-skinned female alien, again played by Zoe Saldana. She also had a romantic relationship with the white male hero. Now think back to Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Remember Lupita Nyong\u2019o was in it? Probably not, as you only heard her voice. She was Maz Kanata, a wizened, shrivelled little alien creature. Nyong\u2019o, who is of Kenyan ancestry, has been one of the breakout stars of the decade. Since she won her Oscar for 12 Years a Slave, she has been showered with modelling contracts, red-carpet invites and accolades (she was People magazine\u2019s \u201cmost beautiful\u201d woman of 2014, for example).Star Wars took the most beautiful woman in the world and basically made her the Yoda of the piece. Nyong\u2019o is currently working on a new sci-fi movie called Intelligent Life. The plot summary reads: \u201cAn employee at a department of the United Nations that monitors outer space inadvertently makes contact with a beautiful woman, who may be an alien.\u201d Nyong\u2019o is the alien, of course. It\u2019s a safe bet the UN employee will be a white guy. You could look at this situation in a number of ways. The first is that women of colour are being cast as aliens by an unthinking industry that still equates \u201cnot white\u201d with \u201cexotic\u201d. That theory holds water with a movie such as Avatar, where the other blue-skinned aliens were also played by not-white actors: Wes Studi (Native American), CCH Pounder and Laz Alonso (both African-American). Or could it be that, in the 21st-century moviescape, there\u2019s still some problem with black women of reproductive age? Especially if they\u2019re getting together with white men? Is that what\u2019s this is really about? Black women already have it doubly hard in the movie industry, between the overwhelming male domination and the #OscarsSoWhite diversity problem. Empowered black women are well represented in music by the likes of Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9 (whose own rediscovered \u201cblackness\u201d has frightened the horses somewhat), but you can pretty much count the number of A-list black actresses on one hand. When it comes to mainstream blockbusters, they all but disappear, usually under a coat of body paint.     Lupita Nyong\u2019o as Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Photograph: Lucasfilm    Take superhero movies. Marvel\u2019s current smash hit Captain America: Civil War marshals most of the Avengers-affiliated team, including, to its credit, a new black superhero: Chadwick Boseman\u2019s Black Panther. But let\u2019s count the numbers. White males: nine, including the absent Thor and Hulk (yes, Hulk\u2019s technically half-green but that doesn\u2019t count). Non-white males: three (Black Panther, Falcon, War Machine). White females: two (Black Widow, Scarlet Witch). Non-white females: zero. Don\u2019t go looking for women of colour in the DC universe, either: they\u2019ve only just discovered women full stop. The only top-flight black female superhero to date has been the X-Men\u2019s Storm \u2013 originally played by Halle Berry, now, in the forthcoming X-Men: Apocalypse, by Alexandra Shipp. In the last X-Men instalment, Days Of Future Past, an entire romantic subplot was filmed involving Berry\u2019s Storm and Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine. They even shared a passionate kiss. But it was all deleted from the final version \u201cfor runtime purposes\u201d. You could be forgiven for assuming this battle had already been fought and won, and that sci-fi and fantasy played their part. Exhibit A would be Plato\u2019s Stepchildren, the famous 1968 Star Trek episode credited with broadcasting the first interracial kiss in US television history. William Shatner\u2019s Captain Kirk and Nichelle Nichols\u2019s Lieutenant Uhura lock lips, but it\u2019s against their will \u2013 their bodies are being controlled by a mischievous race of telekinetic ancient Greeks. It wasn\u2019t technically the first interracial kiss (we\u2019d had one on British TV in 1962), although it was probably the first between a white man and a black woman. There was the expected mild outrage from the Bible Belt, but generally the reaction was positive and the Earth continued to spin on its axis. It\u2019s worth remembering how racially divided the US was at the time. Laws prohibiting marriage between races in the US predated the declaration of independence, and \u201cmiscegenation\u201d (still one of the ugliest words in the English language) was still illegal in some areas in 1967, the year before Star Trek\u2019s kiss. Not that there wasn\u2019t plenty of \u201cmiscegenation\u201d going on before that between white men and black women, albeit in a non-consensual way as a consequence of slavery. The stereotype of the \u201cJezebel\u201d \u2013 a barely clothed, sexually voracious, immoral seductress \u2013 served to legitimise the sexual assault of slave women, and it\u2019s still in circulation today. Even if Nicki Minaj knows what she\u2019s doing, Madame Tussaud\u2019s clearly didn\u2019t when it unveiled its waxwork of Minaj on all fours, bum in the air, wearing not much at all.

In 1958, approval among Americans for marriages \u201cbetween blacks and whites\u201d was just 4%, according to a Gallup poll. In 2013, it was 87%. On screen, it felt like these battles had been well and truly won by the 1990s and 2000s. Just look at The Bodyguard \u2013 admittedly, nobody has since VHS went out of production \u2013 but, amid the cheesy melodrama and plaintive ballads, the coupling of Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner raised barely an eyebrow. Ten years later, Halle Berry became the first black woman to win the best actress Oscar in 2002 for her role in Monster\u2019s Ball, which hinged on her passionate relationship with a white racist prison guard (the movie has been criticised for portraying Berry as a Jezebel). In the same era, Berry\u2019s on-screen partners included Warren Beatty (Bulworth), Hugh Jackman (Swordfish) and even James Bond (Die Another Day). The latter has also rolled around with Gloria Hendry in Live And Let Die in 1973, and had a close shave with Naomie Harris in Skyfall. If nothing else, Bond is an equal-opportunities shagger. Meanwhile, Tom Cruise\u2019s Mission: Impossible love interests have included Thandie Newton and, in 2011\u2019s Ghost Protocol, Paula Patton \u2013 no green body paint required. The pairing of black men and white women (which is far more common in real life) has its own parallel but separate history, it should be added \u2013 as handled in movies like Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner?, Spike Lee\u2019s Jungle Fever and Todd Haynes\u2019 Far From Heaven. It\u2019s taken for granted that black actors like Will Smith, Jamie Foxx and Denzel Washington often have a white female love interest. You have to feel especially sorry for Saldana in this context. She seems unable to fit in wherever she tries. As well as her \u201cexotic alien love interest\u201d roles in Guardians of the Galaxy and Avatar, she also starred in Guess Who \u2013 a gender-reversed remake of Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner?, which had broached interracial marriage a year before Star Trek. In Guess Who, it\u2019s Saldana who brings a white man (Ashton Kutcher) home to her black parents, including intimidatingly sceptical dad Bernie Mac. Unfortunately, the movie devolves into a remake of Meet the Parents, hinging on Kutcher and Mac\u2019s relationship, and leaves Saldana, and observations about race, on the sidelines. As critic Roger Ebert observed in his review: \u201cInterracial relationships may be an area where the daily experience of many people is better-informed and more comfortable than the movies are ready to admit.\u201d Ebert was married to a black woman, so he knew what he was talking about. More recently, Saldana has been criticised for being \u201cnot black enough\u201d to play Nina Simone in a forthcoming biopic. The only place she\u2019s been permitted to have an uncomplicated interracial romance is in JJ Abrams\u2019s rebooted Star Trek, where she plays the new Lieutenant Uhura and dates Mr Spock (by contrast, Captain Kirk shags a green-skinned woman). Mind you, Spock is a Vulcan, so technically it\u2019s still \u201cinterspecies love\u201d. One factor in this reinstated taboo could well be the globalised nature of the modern movie market. An unnamed producer suggested as much in the leaked Sony emails in 2014, discussing the lower-than-expected box office of Denzel Washington\u2019s The Equalizer. \u201cI believe that the international motion picture audience is racist,\u201d the producer wrote to Sony chairman Michael Lynton. \u201cIn general, pictures with an African American lead don\u2019t play well overseas.\u201d You might also remember a certain doctoring of the poster for the latest Star Wars for the Chinese market, in which dark-skinned John Boyega, who took up a third of the original image, was mysteriously shrunk down to the status of a minor detail. Just when the US gets over its own race hangups, it has take into account the rest of the world\u2019s.     Paula Patton takes on another colourful role in Warcraft. Photograph: NBC Universal, Inc.    Thankfully, Warcraft\u2019s racial politics are not as straightforward as they first appear. To its great credit, the movie features not one but two women of colour in its primary cast. Alongside Patton we find Irish actor Ruth Negga as Lady Taria, \u201cqueen-consort of Stormwind, King Llane\u2019s great love and most trusted counsel.\u201d Her brother in the film is white and blond haired. The film\u2019s director has an ethnically mixed family setup himself, being the son of David Bowie, who was married to Somali-born Iman. Jones allegedly only took on Warcraft on the condition that he could make the story more nuanced than a simple \u201cus v them\u201d conflict. Patton was also married to a white man, it should be added: Robin Thicke, purveyor of date-rapist anthem Blurred Lines. They were childhood sweethearts but divorced last year. Thicke\u2019s lachrymose followup album, Paula, looks to have ensured the split was permanent.   Related: Ruth Negga: \u2018I never fitted anywhere \u2013 in\u00a0life or in Hollywood\u2019    By coincidence, Negga\u2019s latest film, Loving, is playing in competition at the Cannes film festival this week. Directed by Jeff Nichols, it is a dramatisation of the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, a white man (played by Joel Edgerton) and a black woman who fell in love and got married in smalltown Virginia in 1958. They were subsequently sentenced to prison then banished for violating the state\u2019s Racial Integrity Act of 1924. The act also deemed that all newborns in the state be classified by race. There were only two options \u2013 \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201ccoloured\u201d \u2013 and, according to the notorious \u201cone drop\u201d rule, a single non-white ancestor in your family tree made you \u201ccoloured\u201d. Six years later, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Lovings challenged the decision, a landmark legal battle that went all the way to the Supreme Court before it was unanimously overturned, rendering the last vestiges of American anti-miscegenation legislation obsolete. That\u2019s what has happened in real life; clearly the movies have some catching up to do \u2013 even those set on far-flung and futuristic fantasy worlds. When you look at it, most of the actors are, technically, mixed race. Patton\u2019s mother is of European descent, as is Berry\u2019s; Ruth Negga is Ethiopian-Irish. The classification of these actors as \u201cblack\u201d is itself a relic of the \u201cone drop\u201d rule and the US\u2019s historical obsession with \u201cracial integrity\u201d. We\u2019re still living with outdated criteria used to define and divide \u201craces\u201d in the first place. We\u2019re all behind the times in some way. Our state-of-the-art blockbusters are even worse.  This article was amended on 12 May 2016 to clarify Duncan Jones\u2019 relationship with Iman. It was further amended on 16 May 2016 to correct the reference to the Todd Haynes film in which a white woman has a relationship with a black man. It is Far From Heaven, not All That Heaven Allows, which was directed by Douglas Sirk.",
