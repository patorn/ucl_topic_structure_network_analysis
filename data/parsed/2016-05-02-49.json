  "body": "Four men have been arrested in connection with the murder of the Honduran indigenous activist Berta C\u00e1ceres, who was shot dead at her home two months ago. Two of those arrested are linked to the company building a hydroelectric dam which C\u00e1ceres had campaigned against.  Sergio Ram\u00f3n Rodriguez, an engineer for the Agua Zarca dam being built by Desarrollos Energ\u00e9ticos SA (Desa), and Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a retired military officer and the former head of Desa\u2019s security detail, were both detained on Monday morning, according to the Honduran public prosecutor\u2019s office.  The four men were due to appear before a judge later on Monday, where prosecutors will outline their alleged links to the crime. C\u00e1ceres, who last year won the Goldman environmental prize for her work opposing the Agua Zarca dam on the Gualcarque River, had previously reported both men to authorities for making threats against her life. Rodriguez had allegedly threatened C\u00e1ceres just days before her death as she led a protest by her group the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) to the river which is considered sacred by the indigenous Lenca people. C\u00e1ceres reported the incident to the authorities, and accused Desa of using local thugs to intimidate her.

The other two detainees are Mariano D\u00edaz Ch\u00e1vez and Edison Atilio Duarte Meza.  Duarte Meza is a former military officer; Mariano D\u00edaz Ch\u00e1vez is a member of the country\u2019s armed forces on active duty. The arrests come amid mounting pressure on the Honduran government to authorize an independent international investigation into the activist\u2019s murder, which has triggered widespread condemnation. C\u00e1ceres, who had reported 33 death threats linked to her campaign against the dam, was killed after two assailants broke into her house just before midnight on 2 March. The four detainees face charges linked to her murder and the attempted murder of her friend Gustavo Castro, director of Friends of the Earth Mexico, who was injured in the attack.  The investigation thus far has been condemned by C\u00e1ceres\u2019 family, colleagues and independent observers. The first suspects were members of Copinh and Castro who were interviewed for several days. It took investigators 11 days to visit the offices of Desa. The family, who have also criticized the authorities for failing to communicate with them while leaking important information to the press, found out about the arrests on the news. Laura C\u00e1ceres, 23, the activist\u2019s youngest daughter, told the Guardian: \u201cThe Honduran state is too closely linked to the murder of my mother to carry out an independent investigation. It is the government who awarded the dam commission and the government who sent military and police to work with Desa\u2019s private security guards, who threatened my mother.\u201d  \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for our struggle and the international pressure for justice, my mother\u2019s murder would already be extinct. We have woken up to this news but it doesn\u2019t change our demands for an international investigation,\u201d she said, speaking by telephone from the town of La Esperanza, where her mother was murdered. The government has so far rejected an offer by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to send a team of experts to Honduras to investigate into the murder of C\u00e1ceres and other high-profile activists.  Honduras is the world\u2019s most dangerous country for environmental rights defenders, with 109 murdered between 2010 and 2015, according to the NGO Global Witness.   This article was amended on 3 May 2016. An earlier version described Gustavo Castro as a coordinator of Greenpeace Mexico; he is director of Friends of the Earth Mexico.",
