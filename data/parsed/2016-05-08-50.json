As campaigners prepare to mark the 200th anniversary of the antiquities\u2019 \u201ccaptivity\u201d in London, Athens is working at forging alliances that would further empower its longstanding battle to retrieve the sculptures. \u201cWe are trying to develop alliances which we hope would eventually lead to an international body like the United Nations to come with us against the British Museum,\u201d the country\u2019s culture minister, Aristides Baltas, revealed in an interview.  \u201cIf the UN represents all nations of the world and all nations of the world say \u2018the marbles should be returned\u2019 then we\u2019ll go to court because the British Museum would be against humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not regard the Parthenon as exclusively Greek but rather as a heritage of humanity.\u201d  But the politician admitted there was always the risk of courts issuing a negative verdict that would wreck Athens\u2019 chances of having the artworks reunited with the magnificent monument they once adorned.  \u201cCourts do not by definition regard [any] issue at the level of history or morality or humanity-at-large. They look at the laws,\u201d said Baltas, an academic and philosopher who played a pivotal role in founding Syriza, Greece\u2019s governing leftist party. \u201cAs there are no hard and fast rules regarding the issue of returning treasures taken away from various countries, there is no indisputable legal basis.\u201d The move came to light as the world\u2019s longest-running cultural row looks poised to intensify. Almost 200 years have elapsed since the British parliament voted on 7 June 1816 to purchase the collection from Lord Elgin, the Scotsman who as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire ordered the frieze to be torn from the Parthenon and shipped to England. Activists are counting down to what they call the \u201cblack anniversary\u201d. In London, only metres away from the British Museum, a huge billboard funded by campaigners in Australia this weekend showed six strategically placed words across a statue of classic nudity \u2013 and above a list of the vital contributions Greece has made to modern democratic life. The words read: \u201cPlease give us back our marbles.\u201d \u201cThere is no point any longer in taking the gentle approach because that has failed,\u201d said Alexis Mantheakis, chairman of the New Zealand-based International Parthenon Sculptures Action Committee. \u201cThe British have never given anything back, be it colonies or artefacts, without pressure. To ignore that fact is to undermine the chances of any success in the campaign for the return of the Parthenon sculptures.\u201d  Seen as the high point of classical art \u2013 a peerless example of beauty in carving \u2013 the antiquities were acquired for \u00a335,000 on condition they be exhibited in the British Museum. Mortified, steeped in debt and determined to dispel rumours that he had exploited his post as emissary to plunder the Acropolis, Elgin reluctantly accepted. It had, all expenses considered, cost him nearly twice that he claimed.  But in a 141-page document of legal advice \u2013 the details of which have been leaked exclusively to the Guardian \u2013 QCs specialised in cultural restitution say Elgin clearly exceeded the authority, or firman, he was given when he ordered the treasures to be \u201cstripped\u201d from the monument. The lawyers, including the human rights expert Amal Clooney, insist that Greece could mount a strong case to win the marbles back. \u201cWe consider that international law has evolved to a position which recognises, as part of the sovereignty of a state, its right to reclaim cultural property of great historical significance which has been wrongly taken in the past \u2013 a rule that would entitle Greece to recover and reunite the Parthenon sculptures.\u201d The advice \u2013 provided at the request of the country\u2019s former centre-right coalition but previously only made public in summation \u2013 amounts to a toolbox of how Athens could pursue its claim to the classical masterpieces. Greece could either bring the UK before the European court of human rights, or the UN cultural body Unesco could apply for an advisory judgment by the international court of justice. Court action could prompt Britain, which has repulsed every entreaty to date, to agree to arbitration or mediation. \u201cThe legal case is strongly arguable, both under international customary law and provisions of the European convention. [Greece] would stand a reasonable prospect of success.\u201d But the lawyers also counsel that Athens should move fast in pursuing litigation. Mired in its longest recession in modern times, many fear the cash-strapped country would not have the means to take such action.  The advice, which took almost a year to draft, was reputedly financed by a Greek shipowner sympathetic to the cause. \u201cUnless the claim is brought fairly soon, Greece may be met with the argument that it has \u2018slept on its rights\u2019 too long for them to be enforced,\u201d the lawyers argue, adding that even if initial litigation failed it would not be the end of the fight. \u201cIf Greece does fail, it will very likely be on technical \u2018admissibility\u2019 grounds, which will have nothing to do with the merits of its claim. A case lost on a legal technicality can often be fought again.\u201d",
