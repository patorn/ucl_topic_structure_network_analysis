  "body": "The mother of a six-year-old girl allegedly murdered by her father has said she did not call for an ambulance for 45 minutes after she found the child dead because she feared her partner would be blamed for the death. Jennie Gray, 36, denied putting the interests of her partner Ben Butler before those of their daughter Ellie, after the prosecutor Ben Fitzgerald put it to her that she was \u201cprepared to say and do almost anything\u201d to protect Butler. She was accused of delaying the 999 call and putting her daughter through \u201cpointless\u201d CPR when she knew she was already dead. \u201cRubbish, rubbish,\u201d Gray shouted during exchanges in cross-examination at the Old Bailey in London on Tuesday. She accused the prosecution of trying to \u201ctwist everything\u201d to suit its case.  Gray is accused of child cruelty, which she denies, and perverting the course of justice, a charge to which she has pleaded guilty. She said she \u201cfroze\u201d when she found Ellie lying unconscious in her bedroom.  Gray told jurors that she had been called by Butler at 12.45pm on 28 October 2013. Butler has told the court previously that he found his daughter unconscious in her bedroom and was so shocked that he went downstairs to lie down. Jurors heard that Gray rushed home in a taxi, and she said Butler had not told her what was wrong.  \u201cI saw Ben on the floor shaking and I was frightened, I saw him crying and he was just there and he was just like that and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just frightened,\u201d she said.  At this point Butler stood up and left the dock with his hand on his chest.  \u201cHe said to me, he said: \u2018I think Ellie\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d Gray told jurors. \u201cI said: \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I think Ellie\u2019s dead.\u2019 And I just froze. My whole body froze, I didn\u2019t know what to do, I couldn\u2019t feel as I was shaking. And I went up the stairs. I went into Ellie\u2019s room. \u201cI saw Ellie on the floor and she was just laying there and I got closer to her and Iooked and her eyes were, her pupils were big, I\u2019ve never seen that in my life. Her eyes looked like they were going up. \u201cAnd she was just laying there and she was just so still. I couldn\u2019t think.\u201d Butler returned to the dock to hear Gray tell jurors that she bent down to hug her daughter. \u201cI was just shaking. I\u2019ve done CPR before and I couldn\u2019t remember it. I was so scared and I grabbed her head and hugged her and I tried to see she was breathing,\u201d she said.  The court heard that an ambulance was not called for until around 2.45pm.  Prosecutors have accused Butler of killing Ellie in a fit of rage, which he denies.  Gray told jurors that her partner had been framed just like he was in 2007 when he was arrested for allegedly violently shaking Ellie. He was later jailed in that case but the conviction was quashed by the court of appeal.  She has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice but denied concocting an elaborate cover-up to protect Butler.  Butler testified previously that Gray wanted to call an ambulance. Asked why she did not do so for 45 minutes, Gray said: \u201cBecause I knew she was gone. I couldn\u2019t think.\u201d She denied that the 999 call in which she and Butler pretended they had just found their girl unconscious was a charade. It was the \u201cnasty\u201d police who made that up, she said. Gray said she was in shock and felt that the police were going to blame Butler for killing their daughter. \u201cI had the shock which stayed with me for a while, and the tears, and then the feeling in your stomach, oh no, they\u2019re going to do it again they\u2019re going to think he did it,\u201d she said.  A postmortem suggested Ellie\u2019s death was consistent with her being beaten around the head with a heavy object or her being thrown against the floor.  Gray said Sutton police were blaming Butler within an hour and a half.   Butler has been charged with murder and child cruelty, which he denies, while Gray has been charged with child cruelty which she denies. The trial continues.",
