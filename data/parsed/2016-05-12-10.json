  "body": "Sam Allardyce never made it home after Sunderland\u2019s survival-securing home win against Everton on Wednesday night. Instead the manager spent \u201ca few\u201d convivial hours drinking with Ellis Short, the owner, but the pair are likely to be stone cold sober when they meet next week to discuss their summer transfer budget and strategy. \u201cI\u2019m only just overcoming a hangover,\u201d said Allardyce, who checked into a hotel in the early hours of Thursday. \u201cBut my next meeting with Ellis will be critical as to whether we struggle again next season or not. The big thing is the new players we bring in and how we can improve the team. We have to move away from the fact that we\u2019re all so happy at being heroes for surviving. We have to think much bigger, have much more ambition.\u201d   Related: Sam Allardyce in dance mode after \u2018one of my greatest achievements\u2019    Allardyce will plead for a substantial budget and also hopes Short will soon appoint a new chief executive to replace Margaret Byrne, who resigned in the wake of Adam Johnson\u2019s conviction on child-sex charges. \u201cThe new chief executive is a very big decision for Ellis and for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope they have a huge amount of football experience. By that I mean working in football, not just transfers. Having experience of how this business works at the highest level. That would be a great help in making this club more successful. \u201cWhat happens between me and Ellis Short will determine where the future lies and how successful we\u2019re going to be. I have a very good working relationship with him which is very, very important. He only wants the best for this football club. His desire is to make this football club more successful than it has been in recent years. He\u2019s been searching for something different for so many years and hasn\u2019t found it. That\u2019s why there\u2019s been so many changes. But those changes haven\u2019t solved the problem \u2013 hopefully I can.\u201d Resigning is the last thing on Allardyce\u2019s mind but he made it clear he expects a decent budget. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said when asked if he would still be at the club this time next year were no money to be made available to him. \u201cI won\u2019t know until we have that conversation. As a manager you never get what you want but you usually come to an agreement, a compromise.\u201d This year, the new top-tier television deal dictates even a compromise is unlikely to come cheap. \u201cOne of the problems is it\u2019s going to be much more competitive because the agents are already buying their next Rolls Royces because of all the money they\u2019re going to make,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll have to pay them what they want for players because if we don\u2019t do it, someone else will. What we have to do is get the best value for money we can. The great pleasure for me is we recruited very well in January. That gives Ellis some confidence.\u201d After guiding Sunderland to safety in their fourth straight relegation dalliance, Allardyce \u2013 who arrived last October \u2013 is praying for a brighter future. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go through what I went through when I first got here again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to think much bigger and have more ambition. We want to be celebrating much more than escaping relegation.\u201d",
