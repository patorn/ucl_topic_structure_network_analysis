  "body": "Chris Evans\u2019 breakfast show will face no further action from media regulator Ofcom over an incident in which actor Jeremy Irons swore live on Radio 2. Irons said \u201cfucked\u201d during an anecdote about fellow thespian John Hurt while being interviewed on the programme, which is listened to by nearly 10 million listeners a week, including a large number of children. Ofcom said Evans, who will make his debut presenting BBC2\u2019s Top Gear on Sunday, had immediately apologised and said his programme\u2019s producers had done all they could do to prevent such an incident happening. However, Radio 2 said they would further tighten up procedures on warning guests to mind their language, including a warning email to their agent or representatives about the perils of live broadcasting. Irons, who appeared on the show on 18 March, was telling Evans and his listeners about a coffee he once had with Hurt. \u201cJohn and I were moaning about [good young actors],\u201d said Irons.   Related: Chris Evans\u2019 Radio 2 show to be investigated over Jeremy Irons swearing    \u201cAnd he said, \u2018You know what I do when I find a good actor? I say to him, \u2018You have a wonderful voice. Have you ever listened to it? And the actor is fucked\u2019.\u201d Evans responded: \u201cYou can\u2019t say that, I apologise on your behalf, can you apologise on your behalf?\u201d \u201cI am really sorry,\u201d said Irons. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that, the actor is bleeped, the actor is bleeped.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen we are at home we say these things, I am most terribly sorry if anyone is offended \u2026 or their children. I\u2019m so embarrassed I can\u2019t talk. It\u2019s so relaxed and so normal in here.\u201d \u201cA little too relaxed maybe,\u201d said Evans. Another guest in the studio joked: \u201cWhat does it feel like to have brought Radio 2 to its knees?\u201d Evans replied: \u201cYou can\u2019t make fun of it, you have got to stop.\u201d Ofcom investigated the show after a complaint from a listener under rule 2.3 of the broadcasting code about offence and offensive language. The BBC said Irons had been given a \u201cfull face-to-face briefing on arrival\u201d despite research suggesting that he was unlikely to use offensive language. It added that Irons was \u201cclearly mortified\u201d and apologised without hesitation. The broadcaster said Radio 2 has now reinforced its policy to limit offensive language in live interviews to emphasise the importance of not using offensive language.  It added that in \u201ca live studio environment such slip-ups can unfortunately happen\u201d. In its finding published on Monday, the regulator said: \u201cIn light of all these factors, Ofcom considered this matter resolved.\u201d An Ofcom spokesperson said: \u201cAfter investigating this programme, Ofcom found the BBC took appropriate steps to limit offence to listeners. The guest and presenter apologised immediately after the swearing, and the presenter apologised again at the end of the item. \u201cThe broadcaster has also taken steps to improve its compliance procedures, to minimise the likelihood of a recurrence. As a result, we considered the matter resolved.\u201d",
