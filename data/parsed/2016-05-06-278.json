The decision to name the \u00a3200m state-of-the-art vessel after the naturalist comes days before his 90th birthday, and is in recognition of his legacy in British broadcasting. The name Boaty McBoatface will live on in the form of the ship\u2019s remotely operated submarine, which will be dispatched from RRS Sir David Attenborough to allow the research crew to collect data and samples from the Arctic and Antarctic. The science minister Jo Johnson tweeted on Friday:    New polar research ship to be named RRS Sir David Attenborough in tribute to a great broadcaster & natural scientist pic.twitter.com/eI07JTje6R\u2014 Jo Johnson (@JoJohnsonMP) May 6, 2016      Hello #BoatyMcBoatface! The name lives on as the remotely operated vehicle aboard RRS Sir David Attenborough pic.twitter.com/o05NByBFhd\u2014 Jo Johnson (@JoJohnsonMP) May 6, 2016    The RRS Sir David Attenborough is being built on Merseyside \u2013 the biggest commercial shipbuilding contract in Britain \u2013 and is due to set sail in 2019. It will provide the UK with the most advanced floating research fleet in the world, looking at the world\u2019s oceans and issues of climate change. A public call for names by the UK\u2019s natural environment research council (NERC) attracted more than 7,000 suggestions. Boaty McBoatface received more than 124,000 votes, the second place contender, Poppy-Mai \u2013 for a toddler with incurable cancer \u2013 received more than 34,000 votes, and Attenborough\u2019s name received more than 11,000. The naming follows an Evening Standard campaign to honour Attenborough, backed by two former environment secretaries, two former culture secretaries and the polar explorer Dan Byles.

In a career spanning six decades, Attenborough has presented critically acclaimed wildlife documentaries on the BBC including The Blue Planet, Planet Earth and Frozen Planet. He said he was honoured by the naming decision and hoped all those who suggested a name felt just as inspired to follow the ship\u2019s progress. \u201cI have been privileged to explore the world\u2019s deepest oceans alongside amazing teams of researchers, and with this new polar research ship they will be able to go further and discover more than ever before,\u201d he said. Prof Duncan Wingham, the chief executive of NERC, will appear before the Commons science and technology committee on Tuesday to field questions about the Name Our Ship competition. Johnson announced on Friday that the government would be investing up to \u00a31m in a new polar explorer programme to engage young people and inspire them to pursue careers in science and engineering.",
