  "body": "Manuel Pellegrini has revealed he knew Real Madrid wanted to sack him as manager only two months after being appointed. Pellegrini, who will be replaced by Pep Guardiola as Manchester City manager in the summer, spent one season at Real in 2009\u201110 before being sacked with the 10-times European champions having finished as runners-up behind Barcelona in the La\u00a0Liga title race. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundo before Wednesday\u2019s Champions League semi-final second leg in Madrid, the 62-year-old opened up on a range of subjects, including the revelation he knew it was always the intention of the club\u2019s president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, to dispense with his services.   Related: Kelechi Iheanacho: Manchester\u2019s City\u2019s defeat by Saints \u2018not a big blow\u2019    \u201cI knew in August I was going to be sacked because he told Villarreal\u2019s president [Fernando Roig] and he told me,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to manage Madrid. What happens is when you manage Madrid, you have to have the capacity to accept the club is not just sporting, it\u2019s really political. And to that extreme, you have to let people interfere who, for me, don\u2019t have the knowledge of football to do so.\u201d Asked if he was referring to P\u00e9rez, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s not me [to name names]. If you let people interfere who don\u2019t have football knowledge, it you let yourself be weakened by the criticism that comes from the political side, the sporting side or from personal interests, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready. \u201cI had the fortune to pass one of the most difficult tests in football and it did not change me at all. I always knew that what the players most appreciated from me was to arrive on Monday and for nothing to have changed whether we had lost or won. I demanded the same from them, the same concepts, independent of what was being said on the exterior. I never played a player because I was advised by someone else, or if I received more or less criticism. Madrid has its model and it won\u2019t change.\u201d City travel to the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u knowing an away goal will significantly increase their chances of reaching their first Champions League final. Pellegrini said Madrid\u2019s defensive tactics in the first leg had surprised him but the Chilean expects Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side to adopt a different approach. \u201cI think we had an attitude of trying to win the game. We will try to do exactly the same in Madrid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t go there for another goalless draw. We will try to get up, press and score, because we always want to score. I also see a more open Madrid. Nobody has scored at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in the Champions League this season. The statistics are to be broken.\u201d However, Pellegrini dismissed a question on whether he is planning to meet Guardiola, the Bayern Munich manager, to discuss the Spaniard\u2019s move to Manchester. \u201cNo, no, I have not spoken to him about it. If I run into him, hopefully it will be in the final in Milan,\u201d he said. Asked if he wanted to avoid Bayern should City reach the final, he said: \u201cNo. I want to get there. I do not care against whom.\u201d",
