  "body": "Roy Hodgson has said it is more than just Daniel Sturridge\u2019s fitness that will determine whether the injury\u2011prone striker goes to Euro 2016, with England\u2019s manager preparing to disappoint two of his players and acknowledging there might be other issues with the Liverpool forward now he has fallen down the pecking order. Hodgson has already informed Fabien Delph he will not be part of the 23-man squad in France next month but England have 25 players before Tuesday\u2019s cut-off point and Sturridge\u2019s place has become vulnerable because of his latest injury problems. Sturridge missed the 2-1 defeat of Australia on Friday because of his recurrent calf issues but hopes to resume training after being unable to take any part this week. His apparent inability to stay injury-free is prominent in Hodgson\u2019s thoughts but the England manager said he would also have to consider whether Sturridge was mentally right for the tournament and, specifically, if he was willing to accept no longer being an automatic starter.   Related: Marcus Rashford\u2019s impact on debut is felt by his new England team-mates    \u201cThey are all the things that go through our minds and we have to weigh up,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cThose things do go through our minds when we are thinking about the tournament and they go through other people\u2019s minds as people know Daniel Sturridge and watch him for Liverpool. \u201cIf I choose him it is because I am convinced he will handle those situations and because I believe he will be able to help us come back from the tournament with good results. If I don\u2019t choose him, then you can speculate why that is.\u201d While Marcus Rashford marked his England debut in Sunderland with a goal inside the opening three minutes, Sturridge cut an unhappy figure in the stands at the Stadium of Light and questions were raised in some quarters, not least by the former Arsenal and England striker Alan Smith, about the way the injury-prone forward spent part of the game fiddling on his mobile phone. Hodgson offered a more sympathetic view. \u201cIn an ideal world you would like them all to be following the game as closely as I do, but this is 2016 and people grow up in a different environment. The one thing I would say about Daniel is not to start questioning his commitment or his desire. If I go to Daniel Sturridge and tell him he\u2019s not going to France, he will be as disappointed as any player I would have to tell. Don\u2019t allow anything to make you think he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d Rashford\u2019s immediate impact has certainly made it difficult for Hodgson to leave out the 18-year-old Manchester United forward but Hodgson has also said he may choose five strikers and is on record as describing Sturridge as his most naturally gifted finisher. Andros Townsend and Danny Drinkwater may also be feeling uneasy as Hodgson prepares for some difficult conversations. \u201cIt is part of the job for which I am paid,\u201d he said. \u201cNo manager will ever tell you it is a part of the job he looks forward to but we can\u2019t take 25, as much as I would dearly love to. So I must make a choice and I will try to explain it as fairly as I can to the players. It will be a one-to-one conversation, not in a public place, whether it is in a private room or a quiet part of the training field.\u201d One player who is assured of a place is Wayne Rooney and Hodgson, preparing for Thursday\u2019s game against Portugal at Wembley, wants his captain to take motivation from the way his involvement has been questioned more than any other time in his 13-year England career. Rooney scored his 52nd international goal on Friday and Hodgson said he was encouraged by the player\u2019s improved form. \u201cWayne is a good footballer \u2013 and good footballers are dangerous people to write off. Players get raised to the sky in the media and then buried more quickly than I, as a coach, would do myself. But I am pleased to see him playing well. Debates will rage; I am happy with that but it is up to me where he plays, if he plays. \u201cTo say I have confidence in him is a given and it would be nice if he can bring some of his latter-day Manchester United form to England. There is no reason why he can\u2019t and possibly the stings and blows he has received along the way have nudged him in the right direction.\u201d",
