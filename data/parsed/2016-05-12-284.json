But how easy would it be to dump Trump for Justin Trudeau or another more attractive leader? The answer is not very, and it won\u2019t even be an option for most.  According to at least one poll, 28% of Americans have at least considered leaving the United States for good \u201cfor a country such as Canada\u201d if Trump is elected. Of those who said they\u2019re considering fleeing, 14% rated the probability as \u201cvery high\u201d. Google searches for the phrase \u201cmove to Canada\u201d spiked dramatically after the Super Tuesday primaries in March put Trump into the lead, hitting levels never before seen.   Related: Maple Match: service helps Trump-fleeing Americans find love in Canada    If you\u2019re very young and flexible, have in-demand skills, and really understand what it means to leave it all behind, or if you\u2019re ultra-wealthy, leaving is possible. For most of the rest of us? It\u2019s much, much trickier to actually move to Canada \u2013 or anywhere else \u2013 than to just utter the phrase. And if you do leave \u2013 well, brace yourself for the financial consequences.  Let\u2019s start with Canada, a country I know a little bit about since my parents were Canadian citizens living in the United States when I was born, making me what\u2019s called \u201can accidental American\u201d, a category I\u2019ll get back to shortly \u2013 and a dual citizen by birth, at least according to the Canadians. (Americans don\u2019t like dual citizenship much and prefer to ignore it altogether.)  Out of curiosity, I decided to see whether I\u2019d qualify for the Canadian equivalent of a green card. My fluency in French, the fact that I attended a Canadian university and have family in Canada help, but without a job offer from a Canadian company or skills in demand in Canada, I\u2019d be rejected. Go ahead, see how you\u2019d fare.  Many Americans will find it tougher to win admission to Canada than they assume. Then, too, there are some Americans that Canada won\u2019t want, including, sadly, those they feel will be too much of a drain on the country\u2019s single-payer healthcare system. A university professor from Costa Rica, Felipe Montoya, recently was denied permanent residency in Canada because his son has Down\u2019s syndrome.     Want to flee to the UK or Canada? It might not be as easy as you think.

National embarrassment does not a refugee make.   Millennials probably are luckiest when it comes to seeking a Trump-free haven. Younger wannabe expats should look at the list of skills that are in demand. New Zealand\u2019s immigration website has lists of high-priority job categories that will get your immigration application fast-tracked. If you\u2019re younger than 30, you can get a one-year working holiday visa in either Australia or New Zealand. Germany has an \u201cartist visa\u201d program if you can prove you can support yourself through your writing, your design, art, music or other creative work. Older emigrants are best off either being wealthy and buying themselves a second citizenship or being lucky and having an Irish grandparent. Second, third and even fourth passports are becoming r\u00e9cherch\u00e9 accessories among the ultra-rich, and countries such as Malta are becoming accommodating in designing programs for them. Some require you to invest in real businesses; others just want you to keep funds on deposit. French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu expatriated himself from his homeland to protest against not its leadership but its tax regime and became a Russian citizen.

Svalbard, the self-governing Norwegian territory whose residents carry guns to defend themselves against polar bears whenever they leave greater downtown Longyearbyen (population about 2,000), and where fresh vegetables are very scarce (as is daylight in winter). On the other hand, if you can support yourself financially, you won\u2019t need a visa or residence permit. But beware of what you wish for.  You may leave the United States, but the US won\u2019t let you go so easily. Specifically, you may be residing overseas but the IRS insists that you keep filing tax returns. Nope, it doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t live here any more, don\u2019t have any income or assets here, or don\u2019t even visit any more. All that counts is that you\u2019re still a citizen. The US is one of a tiny handful of countries in the world to tax non-resident citizens on their worldwide income, and the only major industrialized nation to do so. So before you stomp off to live overseas in a huff, you might want to be aware of just what you\u2019re signing up for: a lifetime of living under two tax regimes and (potentially) paying two sets of taxes. For instance, if you own a house in Canada, you won\u2019t get the benefit of mortgage interest deductions (that\u2019s Canadian tax policy at work). Under US law, you may find yourself paying capital gains tax when you sell it, even if Revenue Canada says you don\u2019t owe them a penny.     Born in the US, Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t lived here since the age of five. He initially simply refused to file US tax returns \u2013 or to pay US taxes on the sale of his London house. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    Few groups are more aware of just what\u2019s involved than the \u201cAccidental Americans\u201d. One famous (former) member of this group is Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London. Born in the US, Johnson hasn\u2019t lived here since the age of five. He initially simply refused to file US tax returns \u2013 or to pay US taxes on the sale of his London house. And then (after quietly paying the bill) he renounced his citizenship.  Many haven\u2019t lived in the US since their birth or childhood; some may not even have social security numbers. That doesn\u2019t matter. They were born there, and if they haven\u2019t relinquished their citizenship \u2013 a costly and cumbersome process \u2013 they have to keep filing tax returns and being aware that they can\u2019t invest in some kinds of mutual funds that might be standard products in their home countries but might trigger big tax liabilities in the US.  While the number of Americans who have relinquished their citizenship, like Johnson, hit a record last year, that number still only just approached 4,300. The reason is the sheer complexity involved, suggests Suzanne Shier, chief wealth planning and tax strategist at Northern Trust. The US doesn\u2019t care that you left because you didn\u2019t like the political regime, \u201cthey look at objective facts, and those facts have a tax consequence. Then the question is whether you are defined as a \u2018covered expat\u2019 who will have to pay an exit tax or not.\u201d  Many ordinary Americans aren\u2019t \u201ccovered expats\u201d \u2013 you\u2019d have to be fairly wealthy, outside your retirement accounts and home \u2013 but just the paperwork proving it is daunting, and the costs of doing that paperwork can be intimidating. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t many people who deal with expatriation,\u201d Shier says. You\u2019d have to be committed to making it happen. Equally, there aren\u2019t many people overseas who will work with expatriates. Try to find an accountant able to fill out a US tax return in Prague or Ottawa; even opening a bank account these days has become incredibly difficult. The Foreign Account Tax Account Compliance Act (Fatca), designed to root out tax evaders, has made it difficult for Accidental Americans to even open a routine bank account in their \u201chome country\u201d. A growing number of Accidental Americans or long-term expatriates are getting letters from their banks threatening to close their accounts and take away their mortgages if they don\u2019t prove, within 30 days, that they have renounced their US citizenship. It has just become far too costly for those banks to comply with Fatca, and as a result, American expats are becoming, in the words of one advocate for Accidental Americans, \u201cfinancial pariahs\u201d. Some of the recipients of those letters haven\u2019t lived in the US since infancy and have never had a social security number, making it virtually impossible to do that. Some weren\u2019t even born in the United States, but simply have a US parent \u2013 another way to acquire US citizenship \u201caccidentally\u201d. But renouncing your citizenship isn\u2019t without its consequences. Shier notes that if you support your child or an ageing parent with gifts, the recipients don\u2019t have to pay taxes on those as long as you\u2019re an American. Give up your citizenship, and they may end up paying gift tax on anything in excess of $14,000 a year. You\u2019ll be a foreigner in \u201cyour own\u201d country, limited to spending only a certain number of days here each year (depending on where you now live and have citizenship). So, how does President Trump sound now? Or will you just fight even harder to ensure that come November, Canada will look a little less tempting?",
