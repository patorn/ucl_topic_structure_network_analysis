  "body": "Toronto police, zookeepers, and residents are on the alert after two rodents of unusual size escaped from a local zoo early Tuesday. The pair of capybara \u2013 canine-sized, amphibious rodents which resemble guinea pigs but are much, much bigger \u2013 are being sought by 30 park and zoo workers in Toronto\u2019s 399-acre High Park, according to the Toronto Sun. Residents have been warned not to approach the animals, which were described by zoo volunteers as \u201cquite shy\u201d, but to call the park authorities.     Residents who spot the 2 capybaras @ large from the #HighParkZoo should contact @311Toronto w/ location details. pic.twitter.com/GMrysxoHGz\u2014 City of Toronto (@TorontoComms) May 24, 2016    Capybaras are the world\u2019s largest rodents and can weigh as much as 150lb, though the escapees in question are closer to 30lb , according to parks department spokeswoman Megan Price.  Price told the Sun that the zoo would initiate an investigation into the escape once the capybaras were returned to safety. \u201cOnce they are rescued, we will obviously be reviewing in detail what happened and if protocols or procedures need to be updated as a result of this \u2014 if, in fact, that\u2019s what happened,\u201d she said. A third capybara remains in its pen at the High Park Zoo, which also features llamas, buffalo, wallabies, emus and sheep.     There is one capybara grazing in the enclosure -- two others are still missing. pic.twitter.com/3alOmndOFg\u2014 Erica Vella (@ericavella) May 24, 2016    Capybara are herbivorous and indigenous to South America, where they are prey to anaconda.",
