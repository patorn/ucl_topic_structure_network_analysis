  "body": "No one will be able to accuse the Daily Telegraph of failing to give space to the debate about the EU referendum.  Its issue on Tuesday was dominated by next month\u2019s poll. Its front page looked like a Brexit propaganda poster with a big photograph of Boris Johnson headlined \u201cI\u2019m fighting for freedom\u201d and a sub-deck: \u201cThe gloves are off in referendum campaign as Boris challenges Cameron to answer five key questions about remaining in EU.\u201d Below it was a splash based on a letter to the paper signed by five former Nato secretaries calling for a remain vote: \u201cBrexit \u2018would help West\u2019s enemies\u2019\u201d. Pages 4 and 5 detailed Johnson\u2019s \u201cchallenge\u201d to prime minister David Cameron with two more EU pieces below it, including a sketch by Michael Deacon, \u201cShelley, Beethoven, Churchill... a classic day in a bitter, bloody battle\u201d. On the op-ed page were articles taking either side, one by William Hague (\u201cA Leave vote would be disastrous for Falklands, Gibraltar and Ulster\u201d) and the other by Richard Kemp (\u201cIt is an EU army that could bring about war\u201d). The leading article, \u201cBoris offers a bright vision outside the EU\u201d, was a hymn of praise to the man who would be PM (and, of course, the paper\u2019s columnist).  But we haven\u2019t finished yet. The letters section was topped by referendum letters (as has been the case most days in recent weeks). Below was a pro-Brexit piece by Alan Sked, \u201cNation states have been the making of Europe\u201d.  And there was a promise of much more to come \u201cas the campaign heats up\u201d with plugs for coming columns by \u201ctop writers\u201d such as Charles Moore, Lynton Crosby, Fraser Nelson, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, Allister Heath, Allison Pearson, Philip Johnston and Juliet Samuel. True, there was plenty of coverage elsewhere. The Times splashed on the a letter from \u201cUS defence chiefs\u201d urging Remain, carried a spread on the Johnson-Cameron confrontation plus an editorial. The Guardian featured the \u201chead to head battle\u201d between Johnson and Cameron on a spread, plus an editorial. The Daily Mail gave the Johnson-Cameron clash full measure, \u201cNow it\u2019s personal\u201d, with a leading article critical of the prime minister and an op-ed piece by historian Andrew Roberts, \u201cCameron\u2019s travesty of history.\u201d It hardly goes without saying that the Daily Express took the opportunity to weigh in on Johnson\u2019s side with a front page headline \u201cBoris: it\u2019s mad to stay in the EU\u201d. As for the Sun, its front page, \u201cCam\u2019s in her Hans\u201d, concerned a claim by Iain Duncan Smith that the prime minister\u2019s EU renegotiation was \u201csecretly controlled\u201d by German chancellor Angela Merkel. Maybe, maybe not. But it was the Telegraph coverage that was the most fascinating, not least because of its vacillation on the matter. Its Brexit heart is sometimes ruled by its Remain head.  For the moment though, its pro-Johnson editorial was informed by its heart. It said that Boris\u2019s \u201cfull-on commitment... is the shot in the arm the Leave campaign needs.\u201d It noted that Michael Gove had conceded that the Leave camp was no longer making the case for remaining in the single market. The UK would be \u201coutside the single market but have access to it\u201d.  This, said the Telegraph, \u201cis a consistent position but one that is open to attack from Remainers\u201d and it is also a \u201cdry\u201d economic argument. What was needed instead was \u201csomeone to articulate a vision of Britain outside the EU and Mr Johnson is the man to do it.\u201d It continued:  \u201cHe can be a popular counterpoint to the prime minister\u2019s increasingly portentous rhetoric... warning of European disintegration if we left. Mr Johnson said he could see \u2018the sunlit meadows beyond\u2019 EU membership and \u2018we would be mad not to take this once in a lifetime chance to walk through that door\u2019.  He is right to observe that the Europe we joined has changed beyond all recognition, which is why this referendum is necessary. Mr Cameron should at least be commended for promising it, even if he must sometimes wish he had not.\u201d  The Telegraph contended that Johnson \u201csought to turn the tables on the Remain camp by challenging it directly to answer five key questions about how Britain would look if we stay.\u201d Then it listed the issues that concern it - immigration, naturally, plus the European Court\u2019s \u201cextensive new powers to intervene in aspects of national life that were once off-limits\u201d and \u201cthe so-called Five Presidents\u2019 report\u201d which \u201cindicates that once the UK referendum is out of the way, the structures of political and fiscal integration will be established that will affect us even if we have no say in them.\u201d The Telegraph concluded: \u201cHow will this be stopped? Mr Johnson, and the rest of us, are entitled to an answer.\u201d",
