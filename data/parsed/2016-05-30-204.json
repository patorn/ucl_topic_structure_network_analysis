One of the most widely translated works in history has been given a 21st-century update with the publication of the Emoji Bible. Described as a \u201cgreat and fun way to share the gospel\u201d, it interprets all 66 books of the King James Version with Unicode-approved emoji and commonly-used internet slang and contractions.    \ud83d\udcd6 of Genesis: 01:001:001In the beginning \ud83d\ude07 created the \u2728 & the \ud83c\udf0e.\u2014 Bible Emoji (@BibleEmoji) April 22, 2016      \ud83d\udcd6 of Luke 2:14Glory 2 \ud83d\ude07 in the highest, & on \ud83c\udf0e peace, good will toward men.\u2014 Bible Emoji (@BibleEmoji) March 27, 2016    Totalling just under 3,300 pages, the book \u2013 subtitled \u201cScripture 4 Millennials\u201d \u2013 was made available on the iTunes store for US $2.99 on Sunday. The translator told Guardian Australia that he or she preferred to remain anonymous, identifying only as the cool-dude-with-sunglasses emoji: \ud83d\ude0e.

Though \ud83d\ude0e wanted to make the Bible available for Android, the book formats used by each platform presented problems: \u201cLike Amazon for instance doesn\u2019t support emoji.\u201d The Emoji Bible had been met with a largely positive reception, said \ud83d\ude0e: \u201cSome really nice things, some not-so-nice things.\u201d This was reflected in the response on Twitter \u2013 along with some translation difficulties.    @BibleEmoji Amen. Awesome. Powerful n fun. I need this.\u2014 bob tinetti (@BobTinetti) May 13, 2016      @danieldiaz132_ @BibleEmoji its the bible, thats so inconsiderate Daniel\u2014 2pac's wife (@zanaynayy) May 14, 2016    \u201c\u2018in the beginning angels created the stars & the earth\u2019 i\u2019m pretty sure it doesn\u2019t go like that,\u201d tweeted one user, prompting a correction from the @BibleEmoji account.    \ud83d\ude07 = God \u270c\ud83d\ude0a https://t.co/G8FKsGWvde\u2014 Bible Emoji (@BibleEmoji) April 3, 2016    Its release comes with declining rates of religious affiliation across the Millennial generation, with the Pew Research Center finding \u201cmuch lower levels of religious affiliation, including less connection with Christian churches, than older generations\u201d in a May 2015 study of religious affiliation in the US population. Asked whether this was a concern, \ud83d\ude0e said, \u201cI think we should worry more about spreading \u270c\ufe0f [peace sign emoji] & \u2764\ufe0f [heart emoji] & less about what church affiliation we\u2019re doing it under.\u201d \ud83d\ude0e declined to say if they were a Christian. \u201cI\u2019m just an emoji, and I \ud83d\udcaaly [flexed biceps] agree with Jesus message of course.\u201d \u201cThat was strongly,\u201d they added. \u201cNot sure if that one came through on translation lol.\u201d",
