  "body": "The Treasury has sent a final warning to the Coalition and Labor before the election, saying if the parties want to return the budget to surplus they must make genuine efforts to reduce spending growth, or be prepared to raise taxes to historic highs. And it seems some voters will not be getting the $315-a-year tax cut on 1 July \u2013 as suggested by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 because the measure will have to pass parliament first. The Treasury published its final budget update on Friday \u2013 the so-called Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO) \u2013 to lock in its budget forecasts before the election. It has made no big changes to its economic forecasts since the budget two weeks ago \u2013 despite the iron ore price falling $5 in the past fortnight and the Reserve Bank cutting rates to a record low of 1.75%. The PEFO is the last word before the election from two of the country\u2019s most senior economic bureaucrats, the Treasury secretary, John Fraser, and the finance department secretary, Jane Halton.  They warn that without considerable effort to reduce spending growth, the next federal government \u2013 Liberal or Labor \u2013 will find it impossible to generate a surplus, of about 1% of GDP, without lifting tax revenue above 23.9% of GDP.

The pair say that even if government spending is cut from 25.8% of GDP to the long-term average of 24.9%, within 10 years, tax receipts will still have to rise from 23.9% of GDP to 24.2% to reach a surplus of 1% of GDP. That 24.2% of GDP figure is well above the average of the past 30 years, they say. They also warn that the commonwealth debt levels are projected to reach recent historical highs, both on a gross and net basis.  They say these debt levels are not an \u201cimmediate concern\u201d, given historically low interest rates and a growing economy, \u201cbut should Australia experience a significant negative economic shock\u201d the debt burden will impose a significant cost on the fiscal and economic outlook.  \u201cIt is crucial for Australia to maintain its top credit rating to ensure the commonwealth\u2019s borrowing costs, and those across the economy more generally, are kept as low as possible,\u201d they warn.   Related: Company tax-cut plan will cost $48.2bn over 10 years, Treasury reveals    It also appears that middle-income voters will not get a $315-a-year tax cut on 1 July, as suggested by Turnbull in the days after the budget. Turnbull, in a radio interview with the ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly on May 4, said the plan to lift the tax threshold for people earning $80,000 (to $87,000) would be covered administratively from 1 July, suggesting the tax cut would be delivered immediately after the election without the need for legislative change. But the PEFO reveals that the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, has said the tax cut would require legislative change \u2013 meaning the measure will have to pass parliament first. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Labor had already agreed to support the tax cut, but the confusion showed the government \u201cclearly had not done its homework\u201d. \u201cNow we know the government had not done the due diligence, not done the key work, to ensure that a personal income tax could be delivered on 1 July as promised, just three weeks after the budget has been delivered,\u201d he said. The government said the $315-a-year tax cut would definitely be handed to taxpayers in full this year. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said: \u201cObviously, a re-elected Turnbull government will legislate those tax cuts as soon as possible and every person across Australia in the relevant income-tax brackets will receive a tax cut as promised in the budget. \u201cThis is a tax cut which takes effect from 1 July 2016,\u201d he said.",
