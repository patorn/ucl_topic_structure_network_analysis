  "body": "Adam Lallana has just dismissed rumours of a summer move to Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 yes, he is friends with Mauricio Pochettino but Liverpool\u2019s stature, appearance in two cup finals this season and his contentment are more persuasive, he explains \u2013 when J\u00fcrgen Klopp appears on the balcony outside the interview room. The Liverpool manager steps inside to offer the assembled journalists some guidance.   Related: Liverpool can save season by winning Europa League, says Simon Mignolet    \u201cAsk him if he knows when Spurs start pre-season training,\u201d Klopp says. \u201cToo late, we have already spoken about that,\u201d Lallana responds. \u201cI asked him and he said 1 July!\u201d Klopp says, booming with laughter as he steps back on to the balcony in the knowledge he has put the England international firmly on the spot. Not that Lallana minds. The 28-year-old values perfectly timed interventions from his manager, considering the arrival of Klopp in October helped rejuvenate the Liverpool career of a player who admits: \u201cIt was only last season that people might have read I was leaving and thought: \u2018Yes, let\u2019s get him out.\u2019\u201d No\u00a0longer. Lallana will be arguably one of the first names on Klopp\u2019s team sheet for Wednesday\u2019s Europa League final against Sevilla having thrived on the manager\u2019s pressing tactics, becoming more influential as the campaign has progressed. \u201cIt was a fresh start for everyone when he came in,\u201d the creative midfielder says. \u201cI just feel really appreciated under this manager. The last seven months have been very important for me. I feel as though I have established myself at Liverpool and I am enjoying it. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for Wednesday. I\u2019ve finished sorting the tickets out and making sure my family get over there. Liverpool have been to big cup finals before but for myself there was just the Johnstone\u2019s Paint trophy a few years ago so I am really looked forward to this. It will be a special night.\u201d There was also the Capital One Cup final in February, when Lallana was one of three Liverpool players foiled by the veteran goalkeeper Willy Caballero as Manchester City won on penalties. That particular memory may be one the former Southampton captain would rather forget but another \u2013 Klopp\u2019s team talk \u2013 is a reason he approaches the Europa League final with confidence. Lallana recalls: \u201cIn the team meeting before he said: \u2018This will be the first of many finals we will have together.\u2019 The way he said it, the words he used, you just believed there would be more finals, whether it was this year, next year or whenever. Three months later we are in another cup final. There is no luck in that. It just shows you his confidence and self-belief and I think that rubs off on the lads, subconsciously or not. \u2018The first of many finals,\u2019 he said, and it just stuck in my mind from the moment he said it. He said we would use the experience whether we won at Wembley or not. We were on the losing side that day but I certainly learned from it and I\u2019m sure the other players did too. We will be better for it and more prepared for this final.\u201d Lallana has looked sharper and fitter in Klopp\u2019s team than during his difficult debut season under Brendan Rodgers but says that is merely a reflection of the manager\u2019s gameplan: \u201cI have been as fit as this before. I had injuries last season, I\u2019ve had a couple of injuries this season but I think the way Klopp wants you to play maybe makes me look fitter. He demands hard work. He demands 100%. He doesn\u2019t do passive. That is a word he uses a lot. He says if you defend passive there is no point in playing. You are entitled to make a mistake and he accepts you will have a bad game but he really won\u2019t be happy if you are not giving it your all.\u201d He may feel appreciated by Klopp and established at Anfield but the \u00a325m midfielder, one of five Liverpool players in England\u2019s provisional 26-man squad for the European Championship, still finds it possible to get on the wrong side of his manager. \u201cHe was screaming at me during the Chelsea game last week but he screams so much on the day of a game you\u2019ve got to take it with a pinch of salt,\u201d Lallana says. \u201cYou definitely can\u2019t take it personally; that\u2019s just him. He was shouting at me to be more compact against Chelsea. The worst thing you can do in that situation is gesture \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 or dismiss it. The best thing is to just nod your head even if you don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s saying. \u201cI made the mistake of saying I couldn\u2019t hear him away at Leicester and that didn\u2019t help but after the game he will always explain he was just trying to help you. He is a great character to have around. I really like the way he is and I think his traits bring the best out of a lot of players. He doesn\u2019t get too angry. He\u2019s more disappointed that we haven\u2019t shown our best. He is emotional and aggressive in his demands but he doesn\u2019t get that angry after a game. He is very structured in what he says.\u201d Klopp and Lallana are next-door neighbours in Formby, where the Liverpool manager has taken up residence in Rodgers\u2019 former home. A little awkward, surely? \u201cIt is nice actually,\u201d Lallana says. \u201cHe has got a nice family, nice kids and I see him walking the dogs. One time I was taking my little boy up for a bath and when we got to the landing we saw him [Klopp] taking out the bins so I put my lad on the balcony and he was shouting, \u2018Klopp, Klopp\u2019 and giving it the fist-pump celebration. He just looked at him and gave him a wave.\u201d As for talk of Lallana waving goodbye to Liverpool should Pochettino, his former manager at Southampton, call this summer, the midfielder \u2013 moments before Klopp\u2019s interruption \u2013 states: \u201cNo, not for me. I\u2019ve got three years left on my contract and I\u2019m really enjoying my football under this manager and getting to two cup finals. I have always had a good relationship with Pochettino. We are very good friends off the pitch but I am at a massive club, playing some of my best football and getting to cup finals. It would be very difficult. I\u2019m sure he knows that.\u201d",
