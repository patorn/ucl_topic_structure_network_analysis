  "body": "Somerset have described Chris Gayle\u2019s latest lewd remarks to a female journalist as \u201cinappropriate\u201d but confirmed there are no plans to cancel the West Indian batsman\u2019s upcoming return to the club this summer. Gayle made a string of suggestive comments to the reporter Charlotte Edwardes in an interview published by the Times magazine on Saturday, in which he asked how many black men she has \u201chad\u201d, whether she had ever engaged in a \u201ct\u2019reesome\u201d and claimed he had \u201cthe biggest bat in the wooooorld\u201d. The latest controversy follows allegations of sexism in Australia at the start of the year when Gayle, playing for Melbourne Renegades, was fined A$10,000 (\u00a35,000) for asking broadcast journalist Mel McLaughlin out for a date live on television and saying \u201cDon\u2019t blush, baby\u201d. Somerset have signed Gayle to play six matches in the NatWest T20 Blast this season, following a brief spell at the club last year, and plan to speak to the 36-year-old about his conduct when he arrives in the country before his first game on 3 June. The county claim there have been no complaints to the club from its members, however, either this weekend or at the start of the year, and the deal remains in place. \u201cI was disappointed to read the article,\u201d Guy Lavender, the Somerset chief executive, told the Observer. \u201cBut as I\u2019ve said before, we found him to be fantastic the last time he was here, in terms of activities both on and off the pitch. It\u2019s a shame, because it detracts from his cricketing ability. The fact is, what he has said is inappropriate. But we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to discuss [it] with him. I\u2019m sure we will. But I don\u2019t see it as grounds not to have him playing for us this summer.\u201d Asked if player conduct was taken seriously at the club, Lavender replied: \u201cVery much so, it\u2019s a key part of what we do. Players are ambassadors of the club. We have a track record of mavericks \u2013 Ian Botham and Viv Richards are examples \u2013 but we take conduct seriously. I\u2019m sure we will have a sensible conversation with Chris when he arrives in the country.\u201d",
