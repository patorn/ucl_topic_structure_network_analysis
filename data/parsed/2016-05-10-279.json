  "body": "Mauricio Pochettino has made Adam Lallana his No1 top super special absolute priority summer transfer target, according to the Sun, and wants to sign him for \u00a320m \u2013 that\u2019s a 20% discount on the price Liverpool paid Southampton for his services two years ago. The midfielder has been a key player at Anfield this season but, they suggest, could be allowed to leave if the Reds attempt to balance their books following a J\u00fcrgen Klopp-fuelled summer squad-restructuring transfer splurge.   Related: Leicester City target Sporting\u2019s \u00a325m Islam Slimani to bolster forward line    That very same \u00a320m figure could also be enough for West Ham to steal Theo Walcott from Arsenal, as they try to get their team ready to thrill the Olympic Stadium. Co-owner David Gold sent tongues a-wagging on Monday by revealing that \u201cwe put in a bid today for \u00a330m for a player and other bids will be going in\u201d. He added further detail to his plans by admitting that \u201cwe are going to make a \u00a320m or \u00a325m bid for a player in England this week. So whatever happens, we\u2019ll bring a top striker in.\u201d The use of the words \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cstriker\u201d in close proximity appear to suggest that he isn\u2019t referring to Walcott here, but the Hammers are widely linked today with a triple-bid for Lyon\u2019s Alexandre Lacazette, Michy Batshuayi of Marseille and Liverpool flop Christian Benteke, with the Telegraph describing their scientific process thus: \u201cIt is believed that West Ham are simply waiting to see which offer is accepted first and will then try to proceed with that deal.\u201d And they\u2019re not stopping there, either \u2013 according to the Mail West Ham also want the Juventus midfielder Roberto Pereyra, who would cost around \u00a312m. Arsenal, meanwhile, are gunning for a double-deal for Leicester\u2019s N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Riyad Mahrez, but at least for the latter player they face some serious competition \u2013 according to France Football Manchester United, Tottenham, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Real Madrid are all monitoring the Foxes\u2019 Algerian winger. Arsenal however hope this is one competition they won\u2019t come third in, and have already started talks over their favoured combo-swoop. At the more cut-price end of the Premier League transfer market, Reading\u2019s Welsh international winger Hal Robson-Kanu is about to become available on a free and is being courted by Southampton, Watford and Swansea, with Wales considered his most likely destination. Henrik Mkhitaryan is in the midst of a contract-renewal shaped argument with Borussia Dortmund which has encouraged the Armenian craftsman\u2019s Blighty-based suitors, Chelsea and Arsenal, to believe they might be able to step in and steal him away. Mkhitaryan is believed to want a buy-out clause in any new deal \u2013 which would also encourage his Blighty-based suitors to believe they might be able to step in and steal him away \u2013 but his club would very much prefer not to give him one. So there are, in summary, three potential conclusions to this story: Dortmund convince the player to accept a clause-free deal (bad news for transfer-related rumourmongers); Mkhitaryan forces the club to write in a buy-out clause (great news for transfer-related rumourmongers), or talks break down altogether causing a massive rift between player and club (which would provoke a veritable transfer-related rumourfest). Current Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic could be allowed to leave, with Manchester United his most likely destination \u2013 but only if Jos\u00e9 Mourinho takes over at Old Trafford.   Related: Bayern Munich sign Dortmund\u2019s Mats Hummels and Benfica\u2019s Renato Sanches    Middlesbrough have already spent nearly \u00a35m on transfers following the promotion they sealed on Saturday, without actually signing any new players. Instead the promotion bonus clauses built into previous deals will force them to send Leicester an extra \u00a31.5m for David Nugent, West Ham a bonus \u00a32m for Stewart Downing and Blackburn another \u00a32m for Jordan Rhodes. Still, as effective-winners-even-if-they-only-drew of the most lucrative game of all time until the play-off final, they\u2019ve got the cash. Liverpool have placed Leicester\u2019s Ben Chilwell and K\u00f6ln\u2019s Jonas Hector on their full-back shortlist after releasing Jos\u00e9 Enrique, the \u00a372,000-a-week Spaniard who has played only 181 minutes this season, earning around \u00a316,000 per minute of action, or \u00a3265.20 per second. While on the field of play, each time Enrique blinked \u2013 occupying around 300 milliseconds of his time \u2013 he earned \u00a388.40. Jamie Vardy\u2019s having a(nother) party: he\u2019s going to get married at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire \u2013 actually not a castle, just a big and kind-of-oldish house with crenellations \u2013 on 25 May. And finally, former Brazil ace Rivaldo has offered some helpful advice to everyone planning to visit his country for the Rio Olympics or just for an old-fashioned holiday: \u201cI urge all of you planning on visiting Brazil or coming for the Olympics to stay in your countries.\u201d Rivaldo sadly hasn\u2019t stayed in his, residing as he now does in America.",
