  "body": "Tuesday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood The crowd at Newcastle this afternoon may barely limp into four figures, but it will still be a significant moment for racing in the north of England and Scotland when the runners go to post for the first race at Gosforth Park this afternoon. All-weather racing has finally arrived north of the Trent, and with another 36 meetings scheduled for this year alone, we might as well get used to it.   Related: Horse racing tips: Tuesday 17 May    For some, the removal of Newcastle\u2019s turf will remain a nagging issue for a long time to come, but there is not a great deal to complain about on today\u2019s card in terms of competitiveness, with not an odds-on favourite in sight and half of the market leaders currently priced at 4-1 or bigger. Steccando (2.00) could be the horse to achieve a small piece of Tapeta history by winning the first race on the new track. Alan Swinbank\u2019s gelding has shown some promise on his three starts to date and is bred to come into his own now that he steps up to 10 furlongs, and while Roger Varian\u2019s debutant Gibbs Hill, a 100,000gns yearling, is well-related and could outclass his field, the betting does not suggest that he is a Guineas winner in waiting. Finn Class (4.10) is a double-figure price for the most valuable race on the card but could be worth a small interest to back up an improved performance to win the Thirsk Hunt Cup last time out. His victory there has taken his rating into the 90s for the first time, but he put together back-to-back victories in June last year, has won on an artificial surface in the past and is a decent price in a competitive race to follow up. Malaysian Boleh (4.40) has plenty of all-weather form which gives him every chance in a tight race, while the price about Glasgon (3.10) looks fair in the most difficult race on the card. Elswhere, King Of Swing (3.15), another who put up a very solid performance at Thirsk recently, is a good bet at around 6-1 at Nottingham, while Cryptic (3.25) should go well at Lingfield. Tipping competition, day two Our winners so far: Monday Paling 3-1 Rusty Rocket 12-1 Gowanauthat 8-1 And our leader is: Toptrapper +14 \u2026 who is clearly the man on form, having won last week\u2019s competition before picking the first two winners this week. Cornsay, melonk and Copshaw pursue on +10. Today, we\u2019d like your tips, please, for these races: 4.40 Newcastle, 5.45 Newcastle, 5.55 Nottingham. This week, we\u2019re offering you a second chance to win a copy of Addicted to Horse Racing by Norton Howells, a late convert to the greatest game, who tells us his tales of trying to crack the code of gambling success. \u201cThe writing is precise yet evocative, with nothing held back, as we discover the vivid consequences of an obsession,\u201d the press release tells me. If you don\u2019t win, you can buy a copy here. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today but you will start on -3.
