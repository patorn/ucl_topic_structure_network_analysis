Symphony to a Lost Generation is a five-movement epic, arranged for a full orchestra and choir, which attempts to document the horrors of the first world war. To complicate things further, the orchestra and choir aren\u2019t actually here. They\u2019re pre-recorded, accompanying a lavish holographic presentation that is projected on to an empty stage, giving the illusion of a theatrical performance.     Adam Donen\u2019s Symphony to a Lost Generation uses elements of Japanese butoh dancing. Photograph: Magnus Arrevad     Over the course of two and a half hours, holographic images of dancers writhe around the stage, while archive footage transports us from pastoral peacetime to the industrial slaughter of trench warfare. Donen describes it as \u201cthe first holographic feature-length work\u201d but it\u2019s more than that \u2013 it\u2019s a symphony, a choral work, a ballet, an opera, an arthouse movie, and a piece of expressionistic theatre using elements of mime and Japanese butoh dancing. The problem is that it\u2019s very much less than the sum of all these parts.  Until 2010, Donen was writing naive, two-chord pop songs that recall Syd Barrett\u2019s more rudimentary creations. He\u2019s since reinvented himself as an orchestral composer, teaching himself to arrange by reading Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Principles of Orchestration. Never mind one of those \u201ccouch-to-5k\u201d exercise programmes, this is the equivalent of a sofa-bound slob attempting to compete in the Olympics having just read Mo Farah\u2019s autobiography.  And Donen\u2019s lack of expertise is sometimes palpable. Themes meander rather aimlessly from Mahler to Mantovani. Nothing is developed or explored. Often the music seems to be scrabbling around trying to illustrate the holographic images, like a hapless cinema pianist accompanying a silent movie. Donen\u2019s scores sometimes do a decent job of transmitting romance and yearning, but rarely convey any sense of horror.  During one scene, when a soldier (played by the celebrated mime artist Ernesto Tomasini) is tied to a tree and shot by a firing squad, the accompaniment sounds like incidental music from a Carry On movie.  The sublime moments come when Donen calms down and concentrates on melody.   Related: 'It\u2019s a grand undertaking for anybody': Adam Donen on his holographic symphony     The third movement, which closes the first half of the show, is a beautiful aria set to a powerful verse by the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova. Two dancers, like bedraggled corpses wrapped in bandages, flail around the stage while the voice of soprano Yana Ivanilova (\u201cfor four weeks / the parched peat bog has been burning / the birds have not sung today\u201d) soars over a simple but effective string arrangement. These moments are rare.  However, this production does suggest that the hologram could transcend its reputation as a daft promotional gimmick or a Futurama punchline and aspire to high art. Under Mikael Jaeger Jensen\u2019s visual direction, dancers can change in size and vanish, fires can encompass a stage, cities can be constructed and destroyed before your eyes. In that sense, you are briefly filled with the awe and wonder experienced by the earliest cinema audiences. Maybe this medium will eventually get the composer it deserves. \u2022 At LSO St Luke\u2019s, London, until 31 May. Then touring.",
