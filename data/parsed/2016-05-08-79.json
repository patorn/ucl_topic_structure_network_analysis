  "body": "Name: Brooklyn Beckham. Age: 17. Appearance: Backwards-hatted Uber XL driver. Brooklyn Beckham can drive? Well, he has a car anyway. Some old banger to practise in before his test, I guess. Sort of. He has been spotted behind the wheel of a brand-new Mercedes C-Class (which cost upwards of \u00a329,000), with what appears to be a driving instructor in the passenger seat. Do his parents know that most instructors come with their own cars? Probably, but they have their brand to think of: Brand Beckham. Shiny, sleek, unbesmirched by BSM\u2019s intrusive logo? Nor, it would seem, by L-plates. The Merc had a discreet L on the back, but not on the front. Of course not. A Mercedes C-Class with an L-plate slapped on the bonnet? How uncool would that look? Way uncool, but without it one faces a \u00a360 penalty. \u00a329,000 for the car, plus \u00a360 for the fine \u2013 it all adds up. Yes, it does. According to GoCompare, insuring a car that expensive for a kid that young would cost \u00a35,326 a year. Being spoiled, turning a steering wheel \u2013 is there no end to young Brooklyn\u2019s talents? He\u2019s also a professional fashion photographer. Is he now? Technically, yes. He was selected to shoot Burberry\u2019s most recent fragrance campaign earlier this year. Why would a top fashion house hire an inexperienced 17-year-old boy to photograph one of its major campaigns? Maybe he owns a really posh camera. Or it could be because he\u2019s celebrity royalty and has 6.8 million Instagram followers. Wow. I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s more than the number of people who watched the Queen\u2019s Christmas speech. An odd comparison, but let me just check that for you \u2026 No, you\u2019re wrong there \u2013 7.5 million people watched the Queen\u2019s speech last Christmas. But they would probably be all old, and not very interested in Burberry\u2019s hip new fragrances. Not that Burberry could advertise on the BBC anyway. As I said, an odd comparison. I suppose the Queen could have a bottle of perfume on her desk, but she doesn\u2019t seem like the type to go in for product placement. No. Hiring the children of famous people as fashion photographers is almost certainly the future of advertising. Do say: \u201cMirror, signal, manoeuvre.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cMirror, pout, click, post.\u201d",
