You know this threat because you\u2019ve heard it\u00a0so many times. Do this, it says, and the super-rich will leave. Choose that, and the wealth creators will flee.   Related: Super-rich may quit London homes under new anti-corruption rules    We saw it splashed across the Guardian last Friday. No sooner had David Cameron laid out plans to dispel some of the murk around the purchase of multimillion-pound houses and offices in Britain than \u2013 hey presto! \u2013 the Guardian reported fresh warnings: the \u201csuper-rich may quit London\u201d. An estate agent who sells mansions and penthouses to billionaires from Russia and China moaned: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to do this and repel the wealth creators.\u201d This is the poshest kind of blackmail. The ne\u2019er-do-wells of yore composed ransom notes with cutouts from newspaper headlines. But when the super-rich hold the rest of us to ransom, they do it through headlines. Comb through the newspapers and you see the pattern: any imposition on the wealthy \u2013 every tax rise or sliver of red tape or opposition policy \u2013 will apparently cause the poor souls to fly, faster than pigeons in Trafalgar Square. Alistair Darling\u2019s 50p tax rate for millionaires causes hedge fund managers to mutter \u201ceveryone is thinking about leaving\u201d. Ed Miliband\u2019s plan to abolish non-dom status provokes upmarket estate agents to shake their heads: \u201cIt\u2019s like the 1970s again, when waves of wealthy people left Britain and it was a disaster.\u201d At the last general election, \u201cleading tax barristers\u201d warned that a Labour victory would be \u201ccataclysmic\u201d. Perhaps you are unmoved by such lobbying. Perhaps you are even now waiting for a quartet of the world\u2019s tiniest violins to strike up. But you, my\u00a0friend, are not a politician. Our elected representatives will shill for the super-rich, such as when Boris Johnson publicly pressed David Cameron to repeal the 50p tax rate. Or they\u2019ll do their marketing, such as when\u00a0the former mayor of London described the 1% as a \u201cput-upon minority\u201d, as persecuted as the homeless or Irish Travellers. Nor is this the sole province of the right: this March, Nicola Sturgeon broke her own election pledge to raise the top rate of tax \u2013 in case it sent the moneymen of Edinburgh and Aberdeen south of the border.     Ed Miliband\u2019s plan to abolish non-dom status provokes upmarket estate agents to shake their heads: \u2018It\u2019s like the 1970s again, when waves of wealthy people left Britain and it was a disaster.\u2019 Photograph: Andrew Drysdale / Rex    Far from leaving, though, the rich\u00a0keep on coming \u2013 in ever greater numbers. London is now home to the\u00a0world\u2019s largest number of billionaires. And the capital\u2019s swankiest\u00a0real estate is more expensive than New York, San Francisco or anywhere else in the west, bar Monaco. But what would happen if they did actually go? As Danny Dorling, the Oxford professor of geography, notes, the ultra-moneyed classes do abandon cities \u2013 \u201cat a time of their choosing\u201d. Long Island was once so rich as to be the setting for the Great Gatsby \u2013 until the crash of 1929. Now the grand houses remain but the big-money holidays at the Hamptons. (For more data, look at Dorling\u2019s new book A Better Politics, free online here.) The other thing we know is that cities that get too high on speculation face a long, long hangover. In the late 17th and early 18th century, Amsterdam was as pre-eminent a world city as London is today. The Netherlands was enjoying its golden age of peace with England, and \u2013 as Neil Monnery points out in his book Safe As\u00a0Houses? \u2013 the exclusive Herengracht was the Dutch canalside equivalent of\u00a0Kensington. Then the bubble popped.\u00a0Using detailed land registers, economic historians can tell us what happened next. House prices peaked in\u00a01738. During the next 20 years, prices fell by\u00a0a\u00a0third. Once you adjust for inflation, property prices in Amsterdam\u00a0would not reach their 1740 levels again for another 250 years. Could that happen here? The big difference is that wealth is far more footloose than it was in the 18th century, so a similar process could happen in far less time. You can imagine the chain of events: the ultra-rich who bought flats and simply left them empty, turning Kensington into a ghost town, would cash out as soon as possible. The restaurants serving oligarchs would turn back into Byron burger outlets, and the expensive estate agents would have to find other sales work. Those car dealerships in the best postcodes selling hyper-expensive Minis would shut down \u2013 because ultra-souped-up small cars are exactly what people buy when they have more millions than sense. The tiny airports dotted around the M25 where the private jets taxi in would soon have grass growing on the tarmac.

Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images    Leave aside the ripple effects in the property market (which would be big and go wide), were the super-rich to\u00a0desert London I find it hard to believe it would have a lasting effect on jobs or taxes. Because the capital is simply a docking bay, rather than a home, for the 1% \u2013 a place for them to park their cash. And you can\u2019t say someone\u2019s left if they were barely ever here. True, pockets of London are now a butler economy to these people, offering them cleaners, drivers, tax advisers, wealth managers and pliable accountants. But how many jobs is that? How many workers and how much in taxes? Look at the figures provided by the British Banking Association, the cheerleader for the finance sector. It estimates that private banking and wealth management employs about 15,000 people across a few postcodes in London, with a few thousand more across the rest of the country. It contributes just over \u00a31bn to the exchequer, the bulk of which is income tax and national insurance contributions paid by its workers themselves rather than the employers.

Stack them alongside the 2 million employed by manufacturing, even in its current state of emaciation, and the tens of billions it pays into the Treasury each year. When was the last time you saw a paper warning of industrialists being about to leave the UK because of the lack of state support? Someone once observed that it was easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. By the same token, it\u2019s easier to imagine the end of London than a London without the super-rich. But the hold the 1% has over\u00a0our politics and our economy is largely psychic. By donating to both the\u00a0main parties, through owning newspapers, they have lobbied themselves into indispensability \u2013 and made the rest of\u00a0us their hostages.",
