  "body": "Nearly two years ago, Suzanne Moore used these pages to call for the establishment of a feminist party. She cited old leftist dreams with arch new buzzwords \u2013 \u201cdismantling neoliberalism\u201d \u2013 and the example of Sweden\u2019s ultra-socialist Feminist Initiative. A feminist and lifelong Tory, I replied in The Telegraph deploring the idea: \u201cThere is, in fact, a party dedicated to \u2018dismantling neoliberalism\u2019 and combating austerity. It\u2019s called the Labour party ... Feminism never has, and never should be, a homogeneous movement. My feminism is directly tied to a commitment to meritocracy and individual flourishing \u2026 so if her grand new feminist party kicks off by nationalising private property, I\u2019m hardly going to be able to sign up.\u201d   Related: Emma Thompson backs Women's Equality party for mayoral election    Most of all, I feared that focusing feminist energy on a fledging party would distract my generation from the real problem: increasing women\u2019s representation in the political parties that actually hold power. This Thursday, I\u2019ll be eating my words. I\u2019ll follow Suzanne into the polling booth, and mark my cross against the name of Sophie Walker, the Women\u2019s Equality party candidate for London mayor. She isn\u2019t perfect, and neither is her new party, though its rapid growth has surprised us all. But more than ever, I\u2019m convinced that without a strong external protest the Tory rank and file \u2013 like much of the Labour party \u2013 will continue to blithely ignore British women\u2019s impatience for a new political deal. It\u2019s not just the number of times that, at Tory parties, I\u2019ve been taken for a secretary (the recent experience of Isabel Hardman, dismissed as \u201ctotty\u201d at a work event, surprised no one); nor the minor party names who have suggested I stand for election, then listed the days of the week on which their wives are out of town. Nor is it the old story \u2013 one of many \u2013 of the selection committee chair who congratulated his team on choosing a non-white man: \u201cat least it\u2019s not a bloody woman\u201d. If one thing has convinced me that the Tory party is still a closed shop, it\u2019s the remarkable rise of Zac Goldsmith.   Related: Questions for the Women\u2019s Equality party | Letters    Goldsmith\u2019s flaws and merits have been debated elsewhere at length. What\u2019s clear is that, as a political candidate, he\u2019s mediocre. Many of those weaknesses are unlucky characteristics rather than sins: that natural diffidence, almost shyness, too often interpreted as aloofness. It\u2019s not Goldsmith\u2019s fault that his billionaire father James was long associated with the shadowy rumour of fascist coups, although in the circumstances it was an odd decision to go after Sadiq Khan\u2019s extremist former brother-in-law (what is Imran Khan up to in Pakistan nowadays, one wonders). We all have embarrassing families. On policy, however, Goldsmith is a mess. He would scrap bus lanes, we are told, though when and how seems undefined. Both major candidates have pandered, shamelessly, to the cycling lobby: of them, however, only Goldsmith veers from lambasting the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of cyclists on the right-leaning Nick Ferrari radio show to promising to rid the road of HGVs in his pro-cycling Action Plan (so long, Tory commitment to small businesses). As with those questionable Tamil leaflets, Goldsmith\u2019s problem isn\u2019t simply that he tailors his pitch to the assumed prejudices of each audience (though Owen Jones is right that decent Tories should denounce this); it\u2019s that he keeps getting caught. None of these things makes Zac Goldsmith inherently unfit to seek office. But it\u2019s hard to imagine a sixth-form expellee, editor only of his uncle\u2019s pet magazine, achieving high office in the Tory party from any other background. His best stunt was funded from his own pocket. The problem is not that privilege should exclude people from office \u2013 like Goldsmith, both the prime minister and the current mayor are Old Etonians; both are canny and capable politicians \u2013 but that it so often allows the mediocre to float ahead of the talented. Khan, too, has a long history of cutting his political cloth to suit the moment. A Tory candidate with proven chops might have not just exposed this, but offered a credible alternative. Crucially, we still struggle to imagine women in power, as much as we also struggle with class or race. It\u2019s no surprise that elite education, and parental sacrifices to achieve it, help you get ahead, but glance around the Tory top table and you\u2019ll see scions of Eton, not Wycombe Abbey or James Allen\u2019s Girls\u2019 School. This may not be much comfort to many black, LGBT or working-class women, but it\u2019s a stark measure of the gender premium. I\u2019m still not convinced that the Women\u2019s Equality party, despite its ambition, is more than a pressure group masquerading as a political party. It seems unlikely, for example, that its efforts did much to save the British transport police\u2019s sex crimes unit, when the journalist Rosamund Urwin has worked longer and harder on the issue. But Walker\u2019s party has already surprised me by building a cross-party coalition while focusing on the issue of representation. It has made noise. As a pressure group, it is working. I introduced myself on the first day of secondary school by announcing to my classmates that I had two great passions: Elizabeth I and the Tory party. Nearly 20 years later, I\u2019m at the bitter end stages of a PhD on Elizabeth I\u2019s literary life, and I\u2019m far too familiar with Tory conferences. Perhaps the only real difference is that I\u2019ve finally learned the rudiments of what not to say to 12-year-olds. So this week marks an existential change, not a trifling whim. I\u2019ve been a Conservative because I believe in old-fashioned ideas of meritocracy. Maybe it\u2019s the party\u2019s turn to catch up.",
