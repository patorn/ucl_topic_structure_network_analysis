Thorp, who claims she was laughed at when she said the demand was discriminatory, told BBC Radio London: \u201cI was expected to do a nine-hour shift on my feet escorting clients to meeting rooms. I said I just won\u2019t be able to do that in heels.\u201d Lots of workplaces have dress codes, so have you experienced something similar? Is there a strict dress code in your office? Is it fair?
