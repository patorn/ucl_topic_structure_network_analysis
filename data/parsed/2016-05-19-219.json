  "body": "An increasing number of companies are setting up on the ground projects designed to improve conditions for workers in their supply chains and alleviate poverty \u2013 a trend reinforced by the UN sustainable development goals. But without the support of government, it\u2019s hard for businesses to make significant breakthroughs and long term change.  Businesses have been working for years in the Dominican Republic, for example, to improve the pay and conditions of banana workers \u2013 many of whom are Haitian immigrants living in makeshift slums. They made progress through signing up to certification schemes and their own projects, but it took the government agreeing to allow Haitian banana workers to apply for legal status \u2013 giving them access to health insurance and bank accounts \u2013 to start to tackle one of the biggest issues. Equally, in Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry, improving the low wages and working conditions of workers can only be done if fashion brands and governments work together. H&M has previously expressed frustration with governments for a lack of action on developing a living wage. While some argue that governments shouldn\u2019t work with companies, others recognise the ability of partnerships to advance development in their countries.
