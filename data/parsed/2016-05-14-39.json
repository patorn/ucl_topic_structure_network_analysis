  "body": "Tim was a psycho soccer dad. As I stood beside the pitch all those winter Saturdays in Canberra, the frozen grass crunching underfoot, the chill wind belting through my ski jacket, I heard stories about what a monster this guy was. He was \u2013 is \u2013 a good guy. So I found the stories \u2013 abusing a child umpire, arguments with other parents, relentlessly pushing little girls to win, post-match sulks, parents asking him to absent himself \u2013 hard to believe. With my son, now 17, I\u2019d had my own terrible experiences of lunatic coaches, controlling managers, and parents living vicariously through on-pitch progeny. One under-sevens coach, a Brit, would dress down the kids (including his own) so ferociously they\u2019d cry. He once told them they were \u201crubbish\u201d. My son answered: \u201cWe\u2019re not rubbish \u2013 we\u2019re just little kids\u201d. Intimidated by a six-year-old with a sturdier emotional foundation, he responded, \u201cRubbish son, you\u2019re just rubbish.\u201d I suppressed a violent impulse; he\u2019d been in the military. There was the psychopath known in my house as \u201cKick-it-to-Bill\u201d. Kick-it-to-Bill ran the line, delivering a stream-of-consciousness invective-fuelled commentary (there was an actual coach whom he assiduously ignored) while his wife loitered way back, pretending to speak on the phone. Whenever one of our boys had possession he\u2019d yell, \u201cKick-it-to-Bill, Kick-it-to-Bill!\u201d His son, Bill. Kick-it-to-Bill lost me long before he abused a 13-year old referee \u2013 \u201cHey, ref, were you born fuckin\u2019 blind you stupid cunt?\u201d The ref, teary, tremulous, bravely told Kick-it-to-Bill: \u201cSir, the language rules apply to parents, too.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it when another demented dad backed Kick-it-to-Bill, saying to the kid, \u201cYou idiot ref \u2013 it was clearly a foul.\u201d I told them they were out of order. Boofhead II stuck his flushed face into mine and demanded: \u201cWho the fuck\u2019s side are you on?\u201d Kids\u2019 soccer lost me right there. But back to Tim, with whom I\u2019ve recently reconnected. This week he shared with me this insight into his descent into soccer parent madness. \u201cIt is easy for me to admit that I was a feral soccer dad. I forgot that kids\u2019 sport is meant to be about fun. I now realise that the reason both girls stopped playing a sport that they were both very good at is that they couldn\u2019t handle the pressure that I put on them,\u201d he says. The \u201cmadness kicked in\u201d when he began coaching a team of six girls who had not been chosen in the mixed boy/girl teams because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want these little girls to get smashed each week\u201d. \u201cI took it upon myself ... to limit the damage ... I was appalling. Not only did I have no idea how to coach but it certainly wasn\u2019t about fun for anyone. The stress and desperation I displayed must have been embarrassing for my wife. But I didn\u2019t notice and didn\u2019t care. I was too far gone in damage control mode,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe teens hired as mentors coached the kids to just take the goal kicks by booting the ball straight up the middle ... I basically completely overrode these young teenagers\u2019 instructions ... While my instructions were right, what I did was wrong. However, the greater issue here was not \u2018it\u2019s-only-a-game-let\u2019s-not-take-it-so-seriously\u2019 it was \u2018stop-telling-my-kids-to-do-things-that-make-them-lose!\u2019\u201d The team stopped getting flogged. Some parents were pleased. But he knew others were \u201cappalled\u201d at his behaviour. The obsession \u2013 \u201cthe madness\u201d \u2013 escalated as Tim took on increasing club roles and coached both his daughters\u2019 teams. \u201cI put ... miles too much pressure on them both to perform. I took every match far too seriously. I obsessed over the match just past and the game coming up. My girls would win if I had to drag them to it myself. It never occurred to me that I was scaring them away from it,\u201d he says. \u201cIn one game our arch enemies\u2019 (yes, I had an arch enemy side!) coach ... sent one of his squad out to \u2018play-the-girl-not-the-ball\u2019 ... we lost to a lucky goal. I was beside myself. I tried to rally support amongst the other parents to ... well, I can\u2019t even remember what I wanted done now. Talk about taking it all too seriously. My girls saw that. They heard me ranting. How could they possibly have thought it was fun?\u201d Tim was coaching two teams, setting up the fields and the barbecue on Saturday mornings, running three age groups and attending monthly board meetings. It segued into summer training and weeknight futsal. Despite the emphasis on winning, Tim insists he wasn\u2019t always a \u201cfire-breathing gorgon\u201d. He encouraged them and praised each girl after every match \u2013 even designed special individual awards for each at the seasons\u2019 end. But there\u2019s no doubt, he says, that \u201cit had consumed my life\u201d. \u201c My girls had immense pressure on them to perform each week so Daddy could win ... I was trying to win and they had to help Daddy to do that. Couldn\u2019t they understand that?\u201d he says. \u201cOne Saturday morning I found myself \u2013 a big, fat, six foot-plus man \u2013 loudly questioning a 14-year-old girl referee\u2019s decision. I apologised to her after the game but I had already destroyed her day. What a bad example. What a douche bag. All perspective lost. We need referees and there I was yelling at a kid. I still feel the shame.\u201d Eventually Tim realised his girls needed better, more objective coaches who didn\u2019t disproportionately pressure them. He gradually withdrew. \u201cIn trying to be egalitarian I forgot to represent my own kids\u2019 interests and my girls got trodden on by the very people I\u2019d often raised up into roles, whose kids I\u2019d guided and forgiven when they\u2019d often acted atrociously ... I still have unresolved issues with a number of people I still feel personally betrayed by. Talk about taking it all too seriously. It was kids\u2019 soccer!\u201d Each child is, of course, different. I have one that doesn\u2019t care, win or lose, another that can only compete to win and a third who refuses to compete because she does not believe games should involve winning or losing. I\u2019m glad Tim\u2019s self-awareness finally kicked in. But I\u2019m convinced the sporting grounds of this nation \u2013 and the world \u2013 are seething with Kick-it-to-Bills.",
