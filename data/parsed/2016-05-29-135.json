  "body": "It\u2019s a drizzly summer morning down here on planet Earth. Soft is-it-or-isn\u2019t-it rain is falling from the sky. The hedgerows are bursting with nettles and cowslips. And the earth is damp and smells of\u2026 I take a deep noseful and think about this. It smells of earth. If you were a long, long way away in a cold and alien place, this spot here, Ottery St Mary, near the folded east Devon hills, is the kind of landscape that might come to you in a hallucinatory dream. It\u2019s the essence of the English countryside on a cool early summer morning. And somewhere, high above, in a tin capsule circling planet Earth, is Major Tim. The urge to quote David Bowie lyrics is almost irresistible \u2013 is irresistible \u2013 because at the King\u2019s School in Ottery St Mary, there\u2019s a massive antenna in the playground, a temporary space station in the school hall and a small crowd of children and parents waiting patiently. Ground control is literally about to call Major Tim: Tim Peake \u2013 our man in space. The first Briton in space for a long time and the first of the modern social-media age, a role that has led to other firsts, including being the first astronaut to appear at the Brit awards and \u201crun\u201d the London marathon and, for one morning only, the first to speak to the students at the King\u2019s School, live, from the International Space Station. Matt Ilsley, a sixth former, steps forward and takes the mike. \u201cGolf Bravo One Sierra Sierra, this is Golf Bravo One Sierra Mike calling and standing by for a scheduled contact with the International Space Station.\u201d He pauses. We wait. It\u2019s a genuinely exciting moment. We\u2019ve had an hour of presentations. We\u2019ve seen a film of a year\u2019s worth of events at the school that have led up to this moment: space-poetry competitions and rocket launches and an art contest. And there\u2019s a whole week of events yet to come. We\u2019ve heard how the school is one of just 10 that were chosen. We\u2019ve had a live countdown on a satellite map. A technical explanation of what\u2019s going to happen. And then\u2026 crackle\u2026 hiss\u2026 silence. Nothing. Static fills the airwaves.     Pupils at Kings School, in Ottery St Mary, Devon, try to make contact with Tim Peake via live radio link. Photograph: Jim Wileman for the Observer    It could be a good moment to panic, but Ilsley, who took a course and an exam to get his foundation radio licence especially for this moment, keeps going. \u201cGolf Bravo One Sierra Sierra, this is Golf Bravo One Sierra Mike calling and standing by for the International Space Station.\u201d I had no idea what technology was required to call space before I turned up, although I had imagined it involved Nasa satellites and cutting-edge boondoggles and possibly a ray-gun. As it turns out, it\u2019s actually a team of middle-aged men and a ham radio rig. There\u2019s something pleasingly homespun about this; it\u2019s a completely voluntary effort that has been more than a year in the planning and has involved a whole army of people. And yet, what they\u2019re doing \u2013 education outreach \u2013 is also a crucial part of the UK\u2019s space policy and an important element of an industry that the government hopes will be worth \u00a340bn a year by 2030. Because manned space flight \u2013 the fact that Tim Peake is out there now, in space, and that public consciousness of it is so high, arguably higher than at any point since the moon landings or at least since Helen Sharman became the first Briton in space, 25 years ago this month \u2013 is just one part of what is a new era of space exploration. Earlier this month, the modern transport bill, which will put into place the legal framework for commercial space flight in the UK, was announced in the Queen\u2019s speech. It\u2019s a spectacular reversal of fortunes. In 1987, the Thatcher administration abandoned our manned space flight programme and decided we would not contribute to the International Space Station. Only in 2012 was this overturned. Libby Jackson, of the UK Space Agency\u2019s education programme, tells me that she first met Peake before that when she worked at Nasa\u2019s mission control in Houston. \u201cHe\u2019d just been selected, but neither he nor I thought he\u2019d be going into space any time soon.\u201d Back in Ottery St Mary, Ilsley is calmly carrying on. \u201cGolf Bravo One Sierra Sierra, this is Golf Bravo One Sierra Mike calling and standing by for the International Space Station.\u201d Still nothing. We\u2019ve been told that the ISS is travelling at 17,000 mph and that there\u2019s only a brief window of time \u2013 eight minutes \u2013 from when he\u2019s in mid-Atlantic to after he\u2019s flown overhead, when we are theoretically able to catch him. And then, suddenly, in a blast of static he\u2019s there, first his voice: \u201cGolf Bravo One Sierra Sierra.\u201d And then his face, beaming away at us from the screen on the stage. The audience cheers and bursts into applause and, one by one, a handpicked group of pupils take the microphone and ask him a question. Ben Sheridan, 11, is one of the first: \u201cI often stare into the inky blackness of the sky and wonder, if the universe is expanding, then what is it expanding into? Has your time in space given you any insight?\u201d     The ARISS radio team at Kings School, in Ottery St Mary, Devon. Photograph: Jim Wileman for the Observer    It\u2019s such a strange and wonderful place, the inky blackness of the sky. What gave you the idea of asking that question, I ask Sheridan later. \u201cIt\u2019s because of Stephen Hawking,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe theory of the big bang. It was so exciting hearing Tim speak about it. He said that the ISS is helping to find an answer to that question.\u201d And what do you think it\u2019s expanding into? He ponders it for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s such a difficult concept to get your head around. I think rocks get thrown out and these group together and become planets and they develop gravity fields.\u201d Sheridan is grappling with the great theoretical questions of the universe. And he is, I\u2019ll repeat, 11 years old. But then, beyond the science that Peake is doing on the ISS \u2013 experiments in microgravity and human physiology and the life sciences \u2013 inspiring the next generation of children has been one of his key tasks. It\u2019s why he appeared at the Brits presenting an award to Adele, and why if you have a young child you\u2019ll have seen him popping up regularly in the CBeebies schedule reading bedtime stories from space. And it\u2019s why he\u2019s been scheduled to broadcast live to Ottery St Mary. Libby Jackson tells me that they\u2019ve reached a million school children through various projects. \u201cWe\u2019ve particularly been trying to target primary school-age children,\u201d Jackson says, \u201cbecause all the research shows that by the time they reach secondary school, some children have already been turned off science for good.\u201d A science lesson was broadcast from space in which 400,000 children took part. And more than 600,000 have been involved in a project organised by the Royal Horticultural Society that has involved planting two lots of seeds, one of which has been up to the International Space Station and back, and comparing the results. \u201cI don\u2019t think space is uniquely able to inspire people,\u201d Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck University tells me. \u201cBut it can have quite a profound effect on them. I was seven when the moon landings took place and that had a quite singular effect on me. But even my students who don\u2019t remember the real Apollo 13 have watched the film Apollo 13 or 2001: A Space Odyssey and something has captured their imagination.\u201d He\u2019s been a vocal supporter of a manned space flight programme \u2013 \u201cmy field is planetary science and my real hope is that we\u2019ll go back to the moon\u201d \u2013 because of the huge scientific benefits that he thinks it confers. \u201cI can make a very narrow case for the real scientific benefits of a manned space programme over using robots or whatever but that ignores the hugely inspirational aspects of having an actual person in space which are enormous. And we\u2019ve really seen that with Tim Peake.\u201d The mother of a five-year-old tells me that her daughter jumps up and down with excitement every time Peake appears on the television. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t recognise many famous people at that age but she\u2019s seen him on CBeebies and they\u2019ve planted rocket seeds at school and she\u2019s really got swept up in the excitement.\u201d     Ben Sheridan with his question for Tim Peake. Photograph: Jim Wileman for the Observer    And though I\u2019ve been immune to, or at least ignorant of, Tim Peakomania until I land in Ottery St Mary, there is something irresistible about it. I am sitting at the back of the hall, and when I turn to my left I notice that the older man next to me is crying. Mac Currie, 69, tells me he\u2019s a volunteer at the Norman Lockyer Observatory in nearby Sidmouth. He did an Open University course in astronomy when he retired and had been drafted in to be part of space week at the school. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s just so much more\u2026 emotional than I\u2019d realised it would be. It\u2019s just quite, quite incredible that he\u2019s up there, rotating around Earth. I\u2019ve got goosebumps.\u201d He\u2019s old enough to remember the moon landings but there are a number of people, many of whom are much younger, who also seem genuinely touched. Anna Musson, 15, who\u2019d won her spot in the hall because she\u2019d been picked to take part in a Women in Engineering project taking place in the school that day, looks genuinely thoughtful when she tells me her reaction. \u201cIt just triggered really interesting thoughts,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d heard about it, but being able to see it first hand, and how much had gone into making it happen, I just found the technology quite incredible.\u201d Alison Argent-Wenz, the school\u2019s chemistry and Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects leader, who put in the application to the UK Space Agency and worked for a year to make it happen, tells me she found herself crying when her 12-year-old son, Freddie, asked a question. (\u201cOver 500 astronauts have been in to space, but only 12 have set foot on the moon\u2026. do you think we will return people there in the future?\u201d) Though in her case they could have been tears of exhaustion. A huge team of volunteers worked flat out to make it happen. The project was initiated by ARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station), enthusiasts who work with space agencies all over the world to inspire children about space and technology. Ciaran Morgan, its UK leader, tells me how they approached the European Space Agency and persuaded them to let them do it and how the rest has been down to the volunteers. \u201cAll Tim has to do is put on his headphones and press a button. We do everything else.\u201d Ten people spent three days setting up the equipment, the audio feeds, the video feed and the satellite backup at Goonhilly, down the road in Cornwall. \u201cAll amateur means is \u2018for the love of it\u2019,\u201d Morgan tells the audience. \u201cAs you see, the equipment we\u2019re using is very, very professional.\u201d It is for the love of it. That\u2019s quite clear. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely exhausted,\u201d he tells me. He\u2019d been up at a primary school in Otley, Yorkshire, four days earlier, working for more than a week, all unpaid. \u201cBut it\u2019s been phenomenal,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cTim has done an amazing job of getting to school students. He\u2019s got two young children of his own and some of his answers have been stupendous. He\u2019s having a ball out there and that just comes across when he talks to them. He\u2019s got a very natural way of communicating. And I really think it\u2019s put a ground wave out there: there\u2019s a reason why you do all these subjects because when you go into the real world so many parts of so many different subjects come together to achieve something like this.\u201d What is less well known is that there is now a whole industry out there. One that involves building things right here in Britain, and we\u2019re actually pretty good at it. It\u2019s space: we\u2019re one of the world\u2019s leading countries in building satellites and, to a lesser extent, rockets. The new Mars Rover is being built in Stevenage. And the space sector is worth \u00a311bn a year to the UK economy and growing at 8.6% a year \u2013 one of the reasons why the chancellor, George Osborne, committed an extra \u00a370m to the British space programme in 2012, opening up the way for Peake\u2019s mission. Because for all the talk of Stem subjects and industry opportunities, talk to anyone who works in a space-related field and they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s because, at a young age, something about space captured their imagination. Matthew Allen, a PhD student in Cardiff who set up a YouTube channel explaining space called UKAstroNut, tells me someone bought him a telescope as a boy. You were the boy in the John Lewis ad, I say. \u201cI was! I was that boy! And it was just seeing those tiny dots in the sky and thinking about the infiniteness of it, that it sort of goes on for ever and the scale of it, the unbelievableness of it, that it\u2019s so hard to comprehend, it\u2019s so abstract and strangely impossible but also true.\u201d         Chris Hadfield sings Space Oddity.    Tim Peake\u2019s warm-up act at the International Space Station a couple of years ago was the Canadian Chris Hadfield, a singing, tweeting astronaut; the first to go to outer space and employ the new media technologies to devastating effect. Funny and knowing, he played the guitar and shortly before he came back down to earth, released a video \u2013 the first music video made in space \u2013 a slightly modified version of David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity. \u201cGround control to Major Tom: Lock your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on,\u201d he sings, floating through the ISS. If you haven\u2019t seen it, watch it. It\u2019s had almost 32m views on YouTube and it\u2019s mesmerising. While Bowie\u2019s song was written in 1969 at the height of the space race and the year of the moon landings, Hadfield\u2019s version conveys what it\u2019s like being in space in a way perhaps nothing else has. Bowie officially endorsed it as \u201cpossibly the most poignant version of the song ever created\u201d. But it\u2019s more than that: it\u2019s a meditation on man and space and our own insignificance. \u201cHere I am, sitting in a tin can/far above the world,\u201d sings Hadfield, looking soulfully into the camera as our big blue planet floats past in the window. Peake has picked up where Chris Hadfield left off, tweeting a stream of incredible images: a plume of smoke rising from Mount Etna, forest fires over Canada, a mountain lake in the Himalayas glinting in the reflected light of the setting sun. \u201cFrom your elevated vantage point looking down on Earth, has your perception of events on our planet, such as conflicts and wars, been altered?\u201d asks Elizabeth Witcombe, 18, when it\u2019s her turn to take the microphone. \u201cDoes the change in perception give any insight we can learn from?\u201d Later, I talk to Witcombe and she tells me she thought of the question because she\u2019d been talking with her mother about how the visual nature of things can change your view on them. \u201cEven though you know, theoretically that Earth looks smaller from space, actually seeing it for real could make you change your opinion. He said he thought it made the world seem more fragile, which I thought was interesting.\u201d Professor Ian Crawford tells me: \u201cI do think this perspective, this cosmic perspective that we can only gain by going out into the universe, has very profound effects. The Apollo astronauts were able to hide the Earth under the thumb of their glove. From Mars, the earth is literally just a star. When environmental awareness took off in the 1960s you can see that this was partly to do with seeing the pictures of Earth that no human being had ever seen before; this whole spaceship Earth concept \u2013 that we\u2019d better look after the planet because it looks pretty small and fragile.       \u201cAnd the only way to get this perspective of the world is to have more people experience it from above, and though it\u2019s only a few people, others can follow it vicariously and seeing the world\u2019s actual situation in the universe can have a profound effect on the way that we think about things.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s what Peake has given us. Direct access to one person\u2019s viewpoint, his line of vision. Simon Ould is another member of the audience who\u2019s snuck in to see Peake and has come over a bit emotional. He says: \u201cOf course, I\u2019d love to go up there, but this is about as close as I\u2019m going to get.\u201d He\u2019s an astronomer who runs a mobile planetarium and is taking part in the school\u2019s space week. \u201cI was nine when the space shuttle went up in 1981 and I got caught up in the excitement around that and it really inspired me. The Hubble space telescope has been an amazing project but Tim\u2019s mission, that tangible link to the UK, the fact that he grew up just down the road, and is wearing a union jack on his spacesuit, it just makes a huge difference. The inspirational effect of space on children in the UK has been a revelation. There\u2019s no doubt that this will inspire a new generation of space researchers.     The equipment at Kings School needed for the link-up with the space station. Photograph: Jim Wileman for the Observer    \u201cA lot of people\u2019s perception is that science is all about facts and figures but it also leads on to incredibly deep questions, some of the oldest questions there are. That\u2019s what space gives us. Why are we here? And what\u2019s it all about? The ancients wondered that when they thought the Earth was the centre of the universe. Now we know that we are just one galaxy among billions, the question becomes even deeper.\u201d It does. It\u2019s what inspired Ben Sheridan\u2019s question about the inky blackness. Though it also underlines how human we are. How we crave human connection and stories and can only cope with the infinity of space and time or even contemplate it when there\u2019s a living breathing human out there strumming along to David Bowie or doing somersaults. \u201cDid you ever struggle with science at school?\u201d Emily Spry, 13, wants to know. \u201cWhat would you say to anyone who finds it difficult?\u201d Tim Peake looks down at her. \u201cI found the maths underlying it difficult,\u201d he says. She nods. It\u2019s a moment of connection. \u201cJust keep trying,\u201d he says. \u201cAnything worthwhile is difficult.\u201d And then it\u2019s over. The eight minutes is up. Major Tim is travelling on at 17,000 miles an hour. Sitting in his tin can. Far above the world.",
