On an afternoon when Tynesiders devoted virtually the entire 90 minutes to imploring Rafa Ben\u00edtez to stay on as Newcastle United\u2019s manager next season his previously underachieving team belatedly remembered they could actually play a bit.   Related: Mauricio Pochettino apologises to Tottenham fans for Newcastle shambles    In the process Aleksandar Mitrovic created one goal, scored another and was sent off for a truly appalling challenge as Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s chances of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1995 were shredded. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s players needed only a point to finish second but ended up third and looking anything but a team capable of competing in next season\u2019s Champions League. Any Championship managers watching this will most definitely not be looking forward to next season\u2019s meetings with Newcastle, which rather begs the question: how on earth did it come this? While Ben\u00edtez\u2019s players shrugged off the inhibitions imposed by fear of relegation, Tottenham\u2019s shockingly abject performance emphasised their failure to recover from the blow of losing out to Leicester in the title race. At other times, on other days, St James\u2019 Park might have staged protests against their watching owner, Mike Ashley; instead Newcastle were politely applauded on to the field before kick-off. If part of that was probably about old habits dying hard, a bigger reason was the \u201cKeep Rafa\u201d agenda. It meant that, rather indulging in \u201csack the board\u201d chants, home fans held up placards proclaiming: \u201cRafa the Gaffa. Please stay. The Toon need you.\u201d Such messages were backed up an incessant two-word soundtrack set to the tune of La Bamba. \u201cRafa Ben\u00edtez, Rafa Ben\u00edtez,\u201d fans chorused, with the volume being raised appreciably once Gini Wijnaldum gave them lead. Spurs had begun in unusually jaded fashion with Toby Alderweireld fluffing an attempted clearance and the ball falling to Moussa Sissoko who played in Mitrovic. The Serbia striker\u2019s deft lay-off found Wijnaldum who shot low into the bottom corner from 12 yards. It was the Dutchman\u2019s 10th goal of a season he had started so brightly before sinking into a prolonged midwinter slump.

Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA    Fortunately for Wijnaldum, the crowd were clearly in a forgiving mood and the Gallowgate End briefly celebrated with a few blasts of \u201cStand up if you love the Toon,\u201d before reverting to their previous refrain. Their spirit was barely dampened by the sight of a small aeroplane circling the skies above them trailing a large banner bearing the message: \u201cAuf Weidersehen Prem: Tyne to go.\u201d It offered proof that some people really do have more money than sense \u2013 there are surely much better ways to spend the best part of \u00a31,000. As if determined to defy that mocking eye in the sky Newcastle swiftly scored a second. Sissoko delivered a fabulous cross from the right and, having beaten both Alderweireld and Kyle Walker to the ball, Mitrovic evaded Hugo Lloris\u2019s reach with an imperious header. Loud as the resultant applause was it seemed bitter-sweet, underscored by a certain sadness. Spurs, meanwhile, had created a solitary first-half chance which featured Karl Darlow doing well to block Christian Eriksen\u2019s fierce shot.   Related: Arsenal finish second as Olivier Giroud hat-trick sees off Aston Villa    As the half wore on, the prospect of second spot and putting Arsenal in their place receded ever faster for Tottenham. Admittedly they reduced the deficit but the consequences stemming from the moment Harry Kane and Eric Dier combined to free \u00c9rik Lamela down the left were destined to serve as the most academic of footnotes. Initially it looked as if Lamela would cross but instead, from a seemingly impossible angle, he unleashed a shot which beat Darlow at his near post, the ball deflecting off the keeper and into the roof of the net. If Darlow appeared less than delighted about that concession, Mitrovic should have been disgusted with himself for an appallingly reckless high, over the top, challenge which caught Walker on the shin and could easily have resulted a broken leg for England\u2019s right back. Mitrovic even tried to contest the inevitable red card before being ushered off by Sissoko. This being a perverse sort of afternoon 10-man Newcastle\u2019s reaction was merely to extend their lead. When Sissoko\u2019s long legs took him into the penalty area he collapsed dramatically after Eriksen\u2019s perceived interception and Wijnaldum sent Lloris the wrong way from the spot. Buoyed by that rather generously awarded penalty, Andros Townsend hit a post, Daryl Janmaat crossed and Rolando Aarons half-volleyed a brilliant goal. Turning creator, Aarons\u2019s pass then picked out the overlapping Janmaat whose low shot defied Lloris. St James\u2019 Park reverberated to a by now familiar theme. \u201cWe want you to stay,\u201d they roared. \u201cRafa Ben\u00edtez, we want you to stay.\u201d Man of the match Gini Wijnaldum (Newcastle United)",
