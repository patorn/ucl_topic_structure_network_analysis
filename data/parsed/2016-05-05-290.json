  "body": "This book is all about a girl called Dorothy/Dot. Dot loves running, sour apple sherberts and puzzles. When there is a talent show at school her friend wants to sing \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d but is shy. Luckily Dot comes to the rescue and lends her lucky shoes. But then she discovers that somebody is trying to sabotage the performance. It is up to Dot, her friend Beans and best pal McClusky, to uncover this mystery. I love the format of this book because it looks like a proper journal, with doodles, stickers and photos. I think it would look even better if it was in colour.  It was oodles of doodles of fun to read. This book is a short chapter book and I would recommend to anyone who likes detective stories.
