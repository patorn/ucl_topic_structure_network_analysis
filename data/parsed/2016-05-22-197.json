Rats are the ideal pet for me, as they fit around my life and are always happy to see me.\u201d And what they really say In this aesthetic age of hipster kittens and cute cockapoos, when pets are ranked according to their Instagram-appropriateness, some of us feel that rats are not getting their due. Rats might not look sweet in a teacup or a knitted tutu, but they make great pets: they\u2019re super-friendly, very clever and like to scrabble around in your jumper before popping up at your neck, like a wriggly scarf. I know this because, when I was 20, I had a pet rat. I called him Barney after the lead singer of New Order. Barney died in unfortunate circumstances (another story), but he was proper fun while he lasted. Anyway. Donna is a rat breeder, a woman who understands rats. She is clearly happy to hold them, fine about them rootling in her hair (rats love walking over your head). I have no doubt she enjoys chasing them around the sofa. Donna has made nice big cages for her rats, but they\u2019ll still need exercise. Rats like to look around, though they won\u2019t run across rooms. They\u2019ve been hunted for too long; they stick to the edges. Rats are curious, and you can easily take one on a trip. You just hide it in your coat. I once took Barney to McDonald\u2019s, but we were thrown out for being vermin (the cheek!). I didn\u2019t mind: I could never get through a bag of chips without Barney swiping at least half of them. Rats are ultra-quick thieves, ninja nickers. Judging by her clothes, Donna is not a goth (rats are a goth clubcard in animal form), so we can say her rats show that she is kind and caring, and that she looks beyond the obvious. She knows that appearances don\u2019t matter as much as affection. She and her rats look happy, just as cute as can be.
