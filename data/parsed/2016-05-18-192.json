  "body": "A surprise new book by Lena Dunham, collecting her journals from a decade ago, has sold out less than 24 hours after the writer announced its release. Dunham\u2019s 56-page chapbook, Is It Evil Not to Be Sure? was unveiled on Tuesday afternoon. Priced at $25 (\u00a317), with proceeds going to the mentoring programme Girls Write Now, its signed, 2,000-copy first print run had sold out by Wednesday morning, although it is still available as an ebook in the US. Fourth Estate, which released Dunham\u2019s bestselling memoir Not That Kind of Girl in the UK, said that as yet it had no plans to publish the new book.   Related: Is It Evil Not to Be Sure? by Lena Dunham review \u2013\u00a0anxious and tender    Dunham explained on her website Lenny that she had found the diaries from 2005 and 2006 on an old hard drive earlier this year. She had been in bed after surgery, she said, and was \u201cfeeling painfully adult\u201d. \u201cI was, of course, full of the kind of mortification that is part and parcel with meeting a former version of yourself, a woefully misguided girl desperate to be embraced by even the least exemplary specimens of young American malehood,\u201d wrote Dunham. \u201cBut I was also moved by \u2013 maybe even proud of \u2013 how carefully I had recorded that period of time, my younger self\u2019s commitment to capturing the kinds of hyper-internal formative moments so often lost to adulthood.\u201d The writer and actor said she had \u201calways believed that women chronicling their own lives, even (or especially) at their most mundane, is a radical act\u201d, and so decided to share the diaries as a short book, to benefit Girls Write Now. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more admirable goal for an organisation, or a better reason to expose the oft troubling thought patterns of my final teenage year,\u201d said the author. It was announced in April that Dunham would be teaming up with publisher Random House to launch her own publishing imprint, Lenny, in 2017. Lenny will publish fiction and non-fiction titles selected by Dunham and Jenni Konner, co-creator of the website Lenny, which covers \u201cfeminism, style, health, politics, friendship and everything else\u201d.
