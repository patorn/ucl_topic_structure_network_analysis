  "body": "Sean Dyche saw his Burnley side seal a \u00a3100m promotion to the Premier League but was happy to swap a champagne celebration for a service-station coffee. The Clarets secured a top-two finish in the Championship with a 1-0 victory against Queens Park Rangers, courtesy of Sam Vokes\u2019s brilliant second-half header. That took their unbeaten run to 22 matches, confirming their return to the top flight at the first opportunity and a bumper pay day as broadcast rights soar for the 2016\u201117 campaign. While Dyche was content for his players to mark the occasion in style, he planned to recreate his modest celebration from the previous promotion campaign. \u201cIt feels fantastic. It\u2019s marvellous. But I\u2019ll be in the car later, driving down the M6 with my kids and my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably grab a coffee at McDonald\u2019s like I normally do. Two years ago people were staring at me like \u2018is he really in here getting a coffee?\u2019, but I am normal, I do have a life, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.

But come Thursday, or Wednesday, they\u2019ll be ready to train. We\u2019ve got a chance to win the title now and we must be ready to take it.\u201d There were joyous celebrations at Turf Moor, with fans pouring on to the pitch while Dyche and his charges took in the moment with their families. But the manager was eager to stress that promotion was only one part of the season\u2019s aims. Having finished second to Leicester City in 2013\u201114, his eyes are firmly on lifting the Championship trophy. \u201cWe\u2019ll be focused on Saturday [against Charlton] I can assure you. We were runners-up last time don\u2019t forget. So we want to win it. That will be the focus. We\u2019ll go and win it, that\u2019s our job. Let\u2019s enjoy it now because this is another part of history for this club and history runs deep here.\u201d Brighton, meanwhile, will have to wait until Saturday for their chance of promotion after fluffing their lines against Derby County. The Seagulls drew 1-1, after James Wilson scored a scrappy 95th-minute equaliser for Brighton, who also had Lewis Dunk sent off after Andreas Weimann had put Derby in front. They must now beat Middlesbrough on Saturday to seal their place in the Premier League. \u201cIt becomes clear [needing to win],\u201d Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager, said. \u201cSometimes when you go into a game knowing a draw will do, a drawing mentality turns into a drawing mentality. We know what we have to do. We just have to show enough quality, against a really good team. There\u2019s no doubt they\u2019re favourites, and they\u2019ll be pleased with the result today, but we\u2019ll give ourselves every chance.\u201d Wilson\u2019s scruffy strike, through a goalmouth scramble, gave Brighton a point, and extended their unbeaten run to 13, something the forward himself believes is important. He said: \u201cGoing into the last game on a defeat is probably the worst way to do it. We have got a point so we\u2019re going up to Middlesbrough with some confidence.\u201d Hughton added: \u201cI think it will give us something. We weren\u2019t at our best, but it\u2019s still a game we didn\u2019t lose.\u201d",
