  "body": "It didn\u2019t take long for Joe Biden to get personal, transforming his voice into its signature hushed tone, while sharing with the crowd before him what it meant to be of the working class. The vice-president\u2019s humble beginnings are well-known: his father, forced to leave his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, after he was unable to find work during the 1950s, eventually settled in Wilmington, Delaware, where Biden senior prospered as a car salesman and provided his children with a middle-class upbringing.  But Biden, while addressing employees and workers\u2019 advocates at the Ohio headquarters of a local ice cream business, retold the story with the sort of unbridled emotion that has helped to solidify his appeal among blue-collar voters. And with the 2016 election year fully under way, he offered both a glimpse of Biden the surrogate and the candidate that could have been. He arrived in Ohio under cloudy skies on Wednesday to tout the economic recovery under Barack Obama and promote a new rule unveiled by the administration this week that would expand overtime pay to millions of American workers.   Related: Millions could get a raise under Obama administration's new overtime rules    Standing inside the headquarters of Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Cream, where founder and CEO Jeni Britton Bauer moved to provide overtime before the new regulation was announced, Biden slipped seamlessly into his persona of \u201cMiddle Class Joe\u201d. \u201cYour job\u2019s about a lot more than a paycheck,\u201d Biden said, recalling the words of his late father. \u201cIt\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about self-respect. It\u2019s about your place in the community.\u201d He then leaned in slightly, focusing his attention on the roughly 50 workers and advocates seated before him.  \u201cYou understand. I can see you nodding your heads,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your dignity. It matters. It\u2019s more than a paycheck.\u201d It was not dissimilar to the overarching message he took to Ohio in 2012 while campaigning for Barack Obama\u2019s re-election. American society was built on the middle class, Biden said, and the time had come \u201cto right this ship\u201d. But despite the rollout of a policy change long in the making, the optics of the trip were difficult to ignore. Accompanied by the labor secretary, Tom Perez, and the Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, both potential contenders for the Democratic vice-presidential slot, Biden\u2019s visit to the must-win battleground state came as both parties turn toward the general election. Even so, all three dismissed the political chatter as a fixation of the media and looked instead to emphasize the official purpose of the day trip: a shift of great significance in America\u2019s overtime pay structure. Previously, salaried workers were only eligible to receive overtime if they earned less than $23,660 a year. Under the new policy, that threshold will nearly double to $47,476 a year beginning on 1 December 2016. \u201cThe vast majority of the American people, they\u2019re not looking for a handout,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey\u2019re just saying, \u2018Hey man, give me a shot.\u2019\u201d Brown, who has spent at least four years advocating for the change, said: \u201cPlain and simple, in the United States of America, when you work extra hours, you should earn extra pay.\u201d  The action is indeed one of the more consequential reforms of the Obama era, paving the way for more than four million Americans to receive a bigger paycheck when they work more than 40 hours a week. Some estimates suggest the number of workers standing to benefit from the rule could be even higher.     Vice-president Joe Biden; \u2018Your job\u2019s about a lot more than your paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about self-respect.\u2019 Photograph: Chris Russell/AP    The magnitude of the announcement did little, however, to quell the political speculation that accompanied the visit. The first question Biden faced in an impromptu Q&A with reporters was whether he thought Brown would make a good vice-presidential pick for the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. \u201cI think he\u2019d be a great choice,\u201d Biden said, before adding: \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of really qualified folks for No 2. Hillary has a plethora of really good people to pick from, for real.\u201d Brown, for his part, deflected the conversation entirely, telling reporters he did not discuss the matter with the incumbent vice-president while aboard Air Force Two. \u201cWe did not talk about that, but I did ride on a really cool plane,\u201d Brown said, adding that both Perez and his Senate colleague Tim Kaine, of Virginia, would be good additions to the Democratic ticket. Biden and Brown did nonetheless embrace the campaign trail as a means to help out Ted Strickland, the former governor of Ohio who is seeking to unseat the Republican senator Rob Portman this November. Both men accompanied Strickland to North Market, a local institution, to dabble in a quick bout of retail politics before returning to Washington. The venue was not chosen by accident: the site was the first Jeni\u2019s ice cream stand before its expansion across the country. And although he was present in the role of surrogate rather than candidate, Biden thrived while at the center of attention of a growing crowd of excited patrons.  Over a combination of vanilla bean and dark chocolate ice cream, the vice-president readily obliged dozens of photo requests, grabbing people\u2019s phones to snap most selfies himself, and doted over babies and toddlers. \u201cRemember, guys, vote Strickland. Vote Strickland,\u201d he urged the crowd. Speaking to reporters afterward, Biden said his efforts would remain on Senate races while the Democratic presidential primary continued. But he acknowledged the importance of appealing to the blue-collar workers whose vote could well be up for grabs in what is expected to be a contest between Clinton and the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump. \u201cOne of the things that would be a big mistake to do is to walk away from a base constituency,\u201d Biden said, while recounting how he campaigned in the pivotal state of Ohio at least 23 times in 2012. He also didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to contrast the core theme of his visit \u2013 on boosting incomes and the middle class \u2013 with the recent assertion by Trump that wages in the country were too high.  \u201cAll this stuff coming from Trump, you know, [about how] American workers are getting paid too much? Where the hell does he live?\u201d Biden said, before pointing out that the US was home to the most productive labor force, superior research universities and the most capable venture capitalists in the world. \u201cThis is time for the United States just to step up and step in. And I think there are so many opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel confident about this year.\u201d",
