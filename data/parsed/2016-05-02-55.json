  "body": "Like Steven Knight, the writer of Peaky Blinders (Travel, 30 April), my parents (both born 1905) and I too come from Small Heath. The man with the rat sounds like Tommy Tank, who my father said would do almost anything for a bet. Allegedly he would ask a publican to catch rats, live, from his cellar and put them in a sack. Tommy would bet how many rats\u2019 heads he could bite off in a given time. Once he walked from Coventry to Birmingham, backwards and with a house brick on his head. In my family, at least, Tommy Tank or just Tommy were used to mean bank. Incidentally, the Peaky Blinders was not just the name of a gang.
