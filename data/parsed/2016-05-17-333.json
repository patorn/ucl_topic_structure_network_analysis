  "body": "The Australian creator of the Faulty Towers Dining Experience has responded to John Cleese\u2019s accusations of copyright infringement, stating that \u201coffers were on the table\u201d with his management as recently as November and Cleese was simply trying to drum up publicity for his own stage show. Cleese accused Interactive Theatre International of ripping off the television series in a series of tweets in March, while he was in Australia on tour with Eric Idle. He said it had not sought permission to use the characters, situations and names associated with the show for its Faulty Towers dining experience, which has been running around the world since 1997.   Related: John Cleese: Fawlty Towers-based show producers 'staggered by vitriol'    At the time, a representative rejected Cleese\u2019s statement that he had only been aware of the tribute show for a year and said producers were \u201cstaggered by [his] vitriol\u201d. Alison Pollard-Mansergh, the founder and artistic director of ITI, finally responded to Cleese\u2019s accusations on 612 ABC Brisbane on Tuesday morning. She said that when she founded the dining experience in Brisbane in 1997 she did not expect it to run for much longer than six months. When it became apparent the show was going to be a success, she contacted Cleese\u2019s then-management by phone. \u201cWe discussed the fact that \u2018this is what we\u2019re doing, this is what we want to do\u2019. Basically the answer was \u2018there is no licence for that sort of thing, good luck with your show\u2019.\u201d Pollard-Mansergh said she regretted not asking for that in writing. \u201cBut who thought, 20 years later, you\u2019d be relying on that?\u201d She said she had been in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with Cleese\u2019s former management over the years. In November, she met with his current management to discuss the Faulty Towers Dining Experience becoming the series\u2019 official tribute show \u2013 \u201cwhich is all I\u2019ve ever wanted, right from the word go\u201d. She was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d when, five months later, Cleese tweeted aggressively about the show and told media he was considering taking legal action against their operation. \u201cOffers were on the table ... we immediately contacted our lawyers and said \u2018what is going on, we\u2019ve got to find out from his management\u2019. We\u2019d only just been talking with them.\u201d She said she had not heard from Cleese\u2019s management nor had he launched any legal action. She said she had been advised that her show was not in breach of Fawlty Towers\u2019 copyright as only scripts could be copyrighted \u2013 not characters, themes or concepts \u2013 and the show used \u201cbasically none\u201d of them. Pollard-Mansergh said the trademark \u201cFawlty Towers\u201d was held by the BBC in the UK and by her company in Australia to protect itself against other tribute shows. \u201cWe are very, very, very successful ... We\u2019ve had some other tribute shows that have used our images, our press material, even our reviews from Edinburgh [Festival Fringe]. That\u2019s why we protect ourselves and we are legally entitled to.\u201d The dining experience involves 10 teams of performers and is held in 20 to 25 countries each year. It has a six-night-a-week residency at the Amba Hotel in Charing Cross in London and Pollard-Mansergh said there were plans to do the same in New York.

Guardian Australia has contacted Pollard-Mansergh, ITI and Cleese\u2019s UK representative for comment. Asked by 612 ABC Brisbane host Spencer Howson why she did not respond to Cleese in March, Pollard-Mansergh said she had been confused and sought legal advice. In the months since, she had received \u201cvery disturbing\u201d messages from Cleese fans. \u201cI\u2019ve done all the right things. My lawyer\u2019s happy with the fact that we\u2019ve gone back to the management,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a process but finally, I think, people are starting to understand the truth.\u201d She said the dining experience had benefited from the publicity. \u201cThere are loads and loads of people in the world that know about us now that didn\u2019t before.\u201d",
