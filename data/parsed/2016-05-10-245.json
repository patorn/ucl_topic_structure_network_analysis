  "body": "Don DeLillo is a writer in love with words. He\u2019s often spoken about the almost physical pleasure he takes in putting black on white, in banging out syllables on his noisy old typewriter, of watching sentences take shape in front of him. He delights in the ebb and flow of language, in riding a lulling rhythm and also in disrupting that rhythm. The sudden shorter sentence. He also just seems to enjoy words for their own sake. Their quiddity; you get the impression that he revels in the fact that if he writes \u201cshoe\u201d, you\u2019ll immediately think of the thing you wear on your foot. He loves to itemise, to catalogue, to amplify. In White Noise, he does so to fine effect. This novel bursts with language. Most obviously, the early chapters are full of long, exuberant lists. There\u2019s a typically fine example on the very first page:   The roofs of the station wagons were loaded down with carefully secured suitcases full of light and heavy clothing; with boxes of blankets, boots and shoes, and books, sheets, pillows, quilts; with rolled-up rugs and sleeping bags; with bicycles, skis, rucksacks, English and Western saddles, inflated rafts.  These are lovely word pictures, at once mundane and strange (why are the rafts \u201cinflated\u201d?). And it goes on. The lists are often simple \u2013 but also lovely in sound and cadence. \u201cBlue, green, burgundy, brown. They gleamed in the sun like a desert caravan.\u201d They can also be hilarious: \u201cThe ashram is located on the outskirts of the former copper-smelting town of Tubb, Montana now called Dharamsalapur. The usual rumors abound of sexual freedom, sexual slavery, drugs, nudity, mind control, poor hygiene, tax evasion, monkey-worship, torture, prolonged and hideous death.\u201d  But the lists aren\u2019t just their for their own sake. This bounty of language at the start of the book, this overflow and variety, and this overwhelming choice of words on offer, all complements a growing idea in the novel about the excesses of consumerism. Sometimes, the lists are explicitly about goods and consumption. People don\u2019t just carry cameras, there are also: \u201ctripods, telephoto lenses, filter kits.\u201d Shopping is to be catalogued and inspected: \u201cHe picked up a bottle of extra-strength pain reliever and sniffed along the rim of the child-proof cap. He smelled our honeydew melons, our bottles of club soda and ginger ale.\u201d And again: \u201cThere were six kinds of apples, there were exotic melons in several pastels. Everything seemed to be in season, sprayed, burnished, bright.\u201d The most frequent criticism I\u2019ve read of White Noise is that by talking about advertising, suburbia, the supermarket, DeLillo isn\u2019t doing anything particularly original \u2013 even if he does it in style. It didn\u2019t take the greatest mind of a generation to notice that consumerism had become a big thing by the time he was writing, in the mid-1980s. While DeLillo may be walking familiar ground, I\u2019d argue that he takes a route few others have travelled. He isn\u2019t just listing items or habits to create the feel of advertising jingles; his rolls of words start to take on the feel of mantras, of religious chants. Most obviously when he repeats the holy trilogy: \u201cMastercard, Visa, American Express.\u201d This idea is even voiced by a character called Murray \u2013 neatly enough, in the form of several jostling lists:  Everything is concealed in symbolism, hidden by veils of mystery and layers of cultural material \u2026 Energy waves, incident radiation. All the letters and numbers are here, all the colours of the spectrum, all the voices and sounds, all the code words and ceremonial phrases. It\u2019s just a question of deciphering, rearranging, peeling off the layers of unspeakability. Not that we would want to, not that any useful purpose would be served. This is not Tibet. Even Tibet is not Tibet any more.  But again, as Murray\u2019s quote suggests, things aren\u2019t straightforward. Plenty of other word lists in the first third of the book generate a similar sense of unreality, always ending in uncertainty and insubstantiality. When Babette appears on TV the occasion merits another catalogue: \u201cIt was the picture that mattered, the face in black and white, animated but also flat, distanced, sealed off, timeless.\u201d We are told: \u201cIt was but wasn\u2019t her.\u201d This journey from the concrete to the ephemeral is given even more literal realisation elsewhere: \u201cThe headstones were small, tilted, pockmarked, spotted with fungus or moss, the names and dates barely legible.\u201d Everything ends in white noise, it seems. Except, there is more. While the lists may come to seem more insubstantial and shadowy as the first part of the book progresses, they also offer the novel\u2019s narrator Jack Gladney something solid to cling onto, helping distract him from the thing he fears the most. They stop him thinking about death. So long as he can look at the items in the supermarket, take in the signals from the TV, and list the things he sees, he doesn\u2019t have to dwell on mortality.   Related: Don DeLillo: \u2018I think of myself as the kid from the Bronx\u2019    When Jack has his most intense worry about who will die first out of him and Babette, he interrupts his thought stream with that \u201cMastercard, Visa, American Express.\u201d He distracts himself by looking at coffee bubbling through the tube and into the \u201cpale globe\u201d of his percolator: \u201cIt was like a philosophical argument rendered in terms of the things of the world \u2013 water, metal, brown beans.\u201d In another episode, he tells us:  I shopped for its own sake, looking and touching, inspecting merchandise I had no intention of buying, then buying it. I sent clerks into their fabric books and pattern books to search for elusive designs. I began to grow in value and self regard. I filled myself out, found new aspects of myself, located a person I\u2019d forgotten existed. Brightness settled around me.  DeLillo\u2019s love and flair for language unite to tell us something more about Jack, something discomforting about mortality and something profound about the way we deal with it. It may be a novel superabounding with words, but none of them are wasted.",
