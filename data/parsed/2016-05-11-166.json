  "body": "Architect Hanna Salameh is blunt about how his city is different from many others. \u201cWe have no concept of sidewalks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe really see them as something you cross over to get to your car. I think that\u2019s why so many people throw trash on the sidewalks \u2013 we have no connection to our streets. You don\u2019t walk there and you don\u2019t see it as yours.\u201d Instead, the streets of the Jordanian capital are something else entirely: slow-moving strips of metallic colour, car roofs gleaming beneath fast food drive-thru signs and glass-fronted malls in interminable gridlock. If Amman was built for cars, it sometimes seems incapable of dealing with them. But the problems of the city don\u2019t end with traffic; infrastructure, public transport, the lack of public space and poor planning are huge issues here. And one project has become a special symbol of the city\u2019s urban failures: the two, magnificent, blue mirrored skyscrapers of the Jordan Gate Project. They can be seen from almost anywhere in Amman. They\u2019ve also been in a state of perpetual suspension for nearly a decade. Eleven years ago the land was a public park \u2013 but it was sold by the municipality to make way for an ambitious hotel, office and mall complex. Then a dispute between investors stopped it in its tracks, and the land is now unused, a location full of memories of picnics and kite-flying, now dominated by two towers rusting grandly in the sun. Salameh, fed up with the lack of progress, decided to make a short video outlining a new plan for the towers. The proposals were ambitious: he suggested replacing the building\u2019s facades with solar panels, turning the lift shaft into a wind power generator, and planting several floors with an urban farm.      The Jordan Gate Project has been on hold for several years. Photograph: Maurits Otterloo    But the response surprised everyone. To date, more than 670,000 people \u2013 nearly 10% of Jordan\u2019s population \u2013 have viewed the film on Facebook alone, and it has attracted tens of thousands of shares and comments. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d he says from his firm\u2019s Amman offices of the interest and support he has received. \u201cIn a good way, though, because one of the main reasons for doing this was to get the people talking, to get people caring about their city and realising that we can come up with our own solutions.\u201d    We have a big problem with public space in Jordan. We\u2019re not used to it  Hanna Salameh     Ammanis have long bemoaned the fact that the towers deprived the area of a public park. They are frustrated at the city\u2019s inability to break the deadlock, and many people suggest that corruption and mismanagement have thwarted positive contributions to life in the city. Until now, however, the disillusionment with the city\u2019s lack of community life has often generated a kind of apathy.  Salameh believes the new response demonstrates an unmet hunger among ordinary people for public space. \u201cWe don\u2019t have real urban life. It\u2019s a car city,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a big problem with public space in Jordan. We\u2019re not used to it. The city was not built to accommodate public space \u2013 although the few places that we do have are doing extremely well.\u201d The area around the towers \u2013 suburban, residential and peppered with malls and stores \u2013 is similar to other areas in the city\u2019s wealthier west. It is organised around a busy highway. Places to congregate include shopping malls and roadside cafes. That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no urban life here \u2013 new parks are hugely popular in Amman, and in some areas the streets are buzzing, especially on summer evenings \u2013 but the layout of the city doesn\u2019t easily lend itself to public space.     There is a significant lack of public space in Amman. Photograph: Rachel Lewis/Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images    At the University of Jordan\u2019s architecture school, Prof Wael Al-Azhari is doubtful that Salameh\u2019s tower proposal is workable. But he believes it demonstrates that people are frustrated with their ability to have a say in how the city is designed. \u201cThey want to see the results of this thing,\u201d he says, adding that the disaster of the skyscrapers is widely perceived as being linked to corruption. \u201cThey\u2019re frustrated with decisions in Amman, and they don\u2019t participate in the decision making.\u201d Part of the problem, Al-Azhari says, is a centralised decision-making process that has a tendency to \u201cshort circuit\u201d ideas from the public, as well as government anxiety over providing public space \u2013 which, he notes, can have the troublesome habit of hosting equally public uprisings. Land ownership has also had a profound effect; much of Amman is owned privately, not by the government, and long-term urban planning is relatively new.

But officials insist that progress on the towers is largely out of their control. \u201cWe don\u2019t own the building or the project,\u201d says Murad Awamieh, the city\u2019s director of special projects. \u201cIt\u2019s owned by the private sector, so we don\u2019t have the authority to say we\u2019re with it our without.\u201d He, too, deems Salameh\u2019s proposal unlikely, but he applauds the idea and its reception. \u201cI felt their emotion,\u201d he says of the public response. \u201cWe all feel the same; we want to see the project done, and to realise this vision for Amman.\u201d To the people who loved the video, such assurances may not be particularly convincing. Their comments suggest enthusiasm wedded with cynicism \u2013 even those who vehemently support the plan suggest that nothing so radical could happen in Jordan, or that corruption will scupper it before it gets off the ground. Salameh feels it isn\u2019t a pipe dream \u2013 several companies have approached him about investing \u2013 but he also believes the conversation it has started is a victory in itself. \u201cPeople are often convinced that nothing good could ever happen, so why bother,\u201d he says. \u201cBut let\u2019s bother!\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion",
