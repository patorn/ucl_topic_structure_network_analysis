  "body": "More and more businesses are realising the value of customer relationship management (CRM). It just makes sense. If you can create and maintain a relationship with a prospect or customer, it builds trust and consideration, which makes them more likely to buy from you, remain with you and ultimately recommend you. But if everyone embraces CRM, surely the competitive advantages mentioned above are lost (in spite of the fact we\u2019re all generally raising the bar from a customer experience perspective)?  Well, yes. That\u2019s assuming everyone executes their CRM programmes to a similar standard. However, that is rarely the case. We come across organisations all the time that have invested significantly in CRM tech without knowing how to use it effectively. Or others who have invested in well thought-through contact strategies, but then decide to get the intern to develop their email copy.  If you\u2019re looking to develop a CRM programme that stands out, here are three tips. Don\u2019t neglect the end product  Many CRM communications lack engagement, empathy and interest. You need to invest real effort to ensure whatever you say lands in the most powerful way possible in order to provoke interaction.  We use an \u201cengagement framework\u201d to help us do this. Think beyond email and direct marketing Omni-channel CRM is the future. There are clever techniques we use now, which allow brands to target highly personalised messages at customers wherever they are online (as if you were talking to them directly).

One of our tech tools allows brands to harvest this additional information on an ongoing basis, which in turn helps them super-charge the effectiveness of their communications.
