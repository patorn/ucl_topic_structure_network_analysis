Youth Food Movement Australia, which organises volunteer-run food projects across the country, says the amount of food thrown out by one household annually equates to one in five bags and costs $1,000 a year. If rotting food was a country, says its press release, not only would it be somewhere you wouldn\u2019t want to spend your holidays, it would also be the third-biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.   Related: Study finds 400m meals' worth of edible food wasted each year    The organisation is encouraging \u201ccook-lucks\u201d, where what\u2019s on the menu is determined by whatever guests have in their refrigerators that needs using up. Consider it a challenge \u2013 like the \u201cmystery box\u201d on Masterchef \u2013 except the carrots are bendy, the use-by dates have just past, and you can\u2019t tell the edible from the mould. Just kidding! You obviously shouldn\u2019t push it much past the point of decomposition. Jamie wouldn\u2019t want you to put your health at risk in the noble pursuit of reducing waste. That said, to quote Kelly Clarkson and presumably, by extension, health professionals, what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger. Here are nine tips from Youth Food Movement Australia to make your groceries stretch the extra distance:   Related: 15 years on, our love affair with food is deepening...so are our problems     Cauliflower leaves can be roasted like kale, radish tops can be used in soups, carrot tops and celery greens can be used like parsley; Redefine \u201cnothing\u201d. If you have some form of vegetables or fruit, carbohydrates and protein \u2013 you have lunch sorted; Pretty much any sad vegetables or fruit can be rescued by pureeing or mashing; Blitz any vegetable scraps you really don\u2019t want to eat with coarse salt, to make a bouillon. Add water when you\u2019re ready to cook for instant stock, or use as a flavoured salt in pasta sauces or stirfries; Half-eaten dips can be thinned out with lemon juice or vinegar and turned into salad dressings; Collect stale or day-old bread and loaf end pieces in a freezer bag to use for french toast; Planning meals ahead saves on waste, but try to make sure half the food you buy can be easily frozen. If you find your meal plans are going out the window on a regular basis, it might be a sign you\u2019re buying too much food; Keep fruit and vegetables separate and in transparent containers or plastic bags so they don\u2019t dry out. If they do, flick them with water; Plenty of fresh food can be frozen, even lettuce and chopped cucumber.             There are more tips on the Youth Food Movement website, but we want to hear yours.
