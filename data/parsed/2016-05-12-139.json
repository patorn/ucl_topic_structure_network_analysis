  "body": "Noel Edmonds has had his say on the future of the BBC, describing it as a \u201cterminally ill corpse\u201d which won\u2019t make it to its centenary in 2022. Edmonds told Radio 5 Live\u2019s Nicky Campbell that the BBC had been guilty of \u201cshocking financial governance\u201d with management talent in \u201cwoefully short supply\u201d. He said the row about disclosing presenters\u2019 pay was a \u201cfarcical diversion\u201d.  In an analogy which drew comparisons on Twitter to Alan Partridge, the former House Party presenter blamed left-wingers who ruined school sports day because \u201ca fat kid didn\u2019t make it over the line first\u201d.    Noel Edmonds says BBC is a \"terminally ill corpse that won't make it to 100\" in 2022 https://t.co/8db2WRbQpk\u2014 John Plunkett (@johnplunkett149) May 12, 2016    \u201cWhen I worked for the BBC, what I was paid to do House Party was all over the tabloid press, there was no privacy there,\u201d said Edmonds who said he was ready to buy the BBC in 2014. \u201cChris Evans is worth every penny he is paid as long as market forces are there. Keeping their pay secret \u2013 what are we trying to hide? \u201cThe BBC must compete. When we get these left-wingers saying \u2018the BBC shouldn\u2019t compete\u2019. These are the people who destroyed children\u2019s lives by saying sports day was about taking part simply because a fat kid didn\u2019t make it over the line first.\u201d \u201cI do not want Auntie to fail and this messing about around a terminally ill corpse is going to guarantee that she does not get the telegram from the Queen in 2022. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
