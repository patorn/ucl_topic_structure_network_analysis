  "body": "I\u2019m a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and the current climate in education is no exception. We\u2019ve all read the headlines: Sats stress made children cry, teachers are quitting in droves, forced academisation against our wills \u2013 and so it goes on. The danger is that we teachers feed off the media and get so caught up in the outcry that we fail to maintain a sensible \u2013 or even professional \u2013 perspective.    No politician takes on educational reform with the sole purpose of eroding a workforce or destroying self-esteem    For me, it started with articles appearing on Facebook. When the first headlines emerged, it felt like the tone of the national media had begun to shift from teacher-bashing to recognising the difficulties our profession faces. I liked and shared posts with gusto. Sympathetic comments and supportive words of encouragement from the online community fuelled an acceleration in awareness-raising. Before I knew it, my newsfeed was full of posts, from disillusioned-teacher blogs to open letters and hyped-up articles of outrage at the latest incompetence from the Department for Education (DfE). With each new directive, the air in the staffroom turned blue. Somewhere in all of this, negativity quickly became the norm. It\u2019s far easier to fight against an oppressive regime than be the lone voice defending it. Just to be clear, I don\u2019t defend many of the recent policy and curriculum changes, nor the way they have been implemented without sufficient consultation or preparation. But what I do defend are the motives behind them.    Related: Secret Teacher: I refuse to let the negativity in teaching bring me down    When it comes to the bigger picture, I honestly think policymakers\u2019 hearts are in the right place. Providing a world-class education for our children, raising standards, improving outcomes for children from disadvantaged families and fairer funding are not objectionable aims. No politician takes on educational reform with the sole purpose of eroding a workforce or destroying children\u2019s self-esteem. We are inevitably going to be resistant to the upheaval of change \u2013 even if it is for the better \u2013 because our plates are already so full. But as teachers, we also know better than anyone that the best of intentions are quickly usurped. We\u2019re in the job for all the right reasons and have big ideas about the utopian classroom we would like \u2013 achieving academic success through inspired and creative means. Yet many of us probably feel we fall short every day. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who, in times of stress, has resorted to dictatorial rule I later regretted. Perhaps one day the DfE will feel the same. And you know what? I like the new primary maths curriculum. Yes, it\u2019s harder, but you can\u2019t raise standards without having higher expectations. I like the focus on reasoning and the \u201cdepth over breadth\u201d focus. I even like the early introduction of algebra and so do lots of my year 6s. I don\u2019t like the spelling, punctuation and grammar (Spag) so much, but we\u2019ve found ways to teach it without anyone handing in their notice. I walked into a year 6 class recently during a timetabled art lesson to find the teacher running an extra Spag-revision session. The children had (only slightly) reluctantly accepted this as a pre-Sats measure and had been promised extra art lessons the week after. It struck me that if 10- and 11-year-olds could see this as a reasonable adjustment to meet a deadline, we were preparing them for the reality of later life and the choices we sometimes have to make.    Self-pitying blogs and political rants, however cathartic, do not help the fragile wellbeing of our workforce    Of course, the DfE has to take some responsibility for our current negativity. I\u2019m sure that if teachers had been better prepared for changes in standards and assessment, with clear guidance and training for a gradual and manageable introduction, we would have been far better equipped to ensure they were successful. And if reforms hadn\u2019t accompanied a shift in Ofsted criteria, a void in information about assessment, threats of academisation and the introduction of performance-related pay we would have been able to maintain a healthy and rational perspective.  But I also realised that self-pitying blogs and political rants, however cathartic, do not help the fragile wellbeing of our workforce. Rather it relies on the support we give each other to succeed \u2013 harnessing our resources, focusing on the bigger picture and not losing sight of the children\u2019s best interests. Take testing as an example. It has both positive and negative effects. It\u2019s time that could be spent teaching, it can put children under pressure and some would argue it doesn\u2019t tell us anything we wouldn\u2019t already know. But it\u2019s also right that teachers are held accountable for the education they deliver, that children learn to persevere and be resilient with things they find tricky, and that our expectations of learning are high.  And we can choose how it works. There is no requirement to do endless class tests, nor to administer the Sats to any child clearly working below the expected level. There is no requirement to test in every subject or every year group, or to increase the time spent on core subjects at the expense of a balanced curriculum. It\u2019s often schools who convince themselves such measures are necessary; we\u2019ve lost sight of the bigger picture.   Related: Secret Teacher: we have one of the best jobs in the world, so stop moaning    A change of approach might be enough to circumnavigate the destructive spiral we talk ourselves into. If \u201cWhy do we have to do this?\u201d becomes \u201cHow might the children benefit from this?\u201d, we could get more constructive responses. The prospect of becoming an academy might be terrifying \u2013 or an exciting venture into new territory.  We may feel we are fighting against changes we wouldn\u2019t have chosen. But a lot of the power to decide how we implement them is in our hands. Positive. Mental. Attitude.
