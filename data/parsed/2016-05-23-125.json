  "body": "What makes someone middle class? There are the usual cliched signifiers: wearing Boden clothes, shopping at Waitrose, Mandarin classes for the kiddies. None of these things mean anything to me, but I still count myself as middle class. And yet I have a Lancashire accent and say class with a short \u201ca\u201d (/\u00e6/) and not clars. I mention this as there seems to be a presumption that being northern means you are automatically working class. We saw it in Maxine Peake\u2019s recent revelation that she couldn\u2019t play a barrister, according to the BBC, because of her flat vowels. \u201cMartha\u2019s been to university,\u201d they reportedly told her. \u201cShe\u2019s educated.\u201d Meanwhile teachers with funny voices like mine are being encouraged to ditch their regional accents, to \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201cadopt a more middle-class one\u201d, a common conflation that is still largely left unchallenged.   Related: Why are schools trying to wipe out regional accents? | Lynsey Hanley    Aspiring Manchester mayor Andy Burnham hasn\u2019t helped matters either, with his stereotype-appeasing comments last week. \u201cIt\u2019s harder growing up in the north-west,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you want to be a doctor, lawyer or MP you get the mickey taken out of you.\u201d This is news to me. I went to the local comp but my best friend wanted to be an international lawyer, and I can\u2019t remember anyone teasing her for this. Old classmates include a dentist, a doctor and an architect, and they still go down ginnels and eat barm cakes. It\u2019s preposterous, really. Does anyone really think there aren\u2019t lawyers, doctors and university professors from Manchester, Leeds and Carlisle who speak with northern vowels? Why would a Boltonian sound like they are from Basingstoke?           Victoria Wood: her funniest moments    I\u2019ll leave aside the fact that education is supposed to open up minds and challenge stereotypes, rather than enforce them, and focus instead on the sense of displacement this leaves you with. Because if I am not middle class, then what am I? The working class wouldn\u2019t have me. At a school quiz, my children were asked, \u201cWhat cake do you eat at Christmas?\u201d, and they all answered, \u201cPanettone\u201d. I meditate, only when I chant \u201com shanti\u201d, I say it with a Ramsbottom accent. There must be millions of us \u2013 the strangely classless \u2013 all walking around with our daft dialects and John Lewis bags, our National Trust cards and gardening clogs, wondering where exactly our place is in British society now that our voices have been deemed not middle-class enough. Which, really, of course, means: not standardised south-east. I noticed the same linguistic prejudice when Victoria Wood died, with all the heartfelt eulogies that presumed she was working class. I\u2019m a huge Victoria Wood fan, but, as a Bury girl myself, I have a strong inkling that she wasn\u2019t \u2013 from the fact that she went to the fee-paying, private grammar school where my mother taught. I saw her some years ago in Marks & Spencer in Muswell Hill, but even before she hit north London, I suspect her upbringing was hardly like Kes. And here\u2019s the thing: every native in the north speaks with a northern accent, like people from Spain sound Spanish. There might be degrees of strength, but everyone, from the headteacher to the cleaner, speaks with northern vowels. You don\u2019t hear \u201cparth\u201d or \u201clarf\u201d except from the mouths of southerners. Is it impossible to accept that someone can have a northern accent and still be a member of the chattering classes? Alan Bennett, William Hague \u2013 and yes, Victoria Wood. Surely it\u2019s not a shock to grasp that they were hardly from down t\u2019 pit. It\u2019s depressing, really, that something as obvious as this has to be said. It\u2019s the linguistic equivalent of politely reminding people that not everyone oop north wears a flat cap, keeps a whippet and has bread and butter with everything. I could point out that these prejudices exist because of the lack of diversity in the national media, which Victoria Wood was brilliant at ribbing: (\u201cWe\u2019d like to apologise to viewers in the north \u2013 it must be awful for you.\u201d) Chip on my shoulder? Maybe, but at least, as Stuart Maconie says, \u201cIt\u2019s a decent chip with gravy and mushy peas.\u201d",
