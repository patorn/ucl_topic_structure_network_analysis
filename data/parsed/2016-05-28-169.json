  "body": "I retired three years ago but now I\u2019d like to find some part-time work I retired almost three years ago, after 40-plus years in NHS management. I had always intended to take short-term contracts or ad hoc work, however within weeks I suffered some health problems and had not felt fit enough to work, until recently. I am now fully recovered and would love to start work again, on a part-time basis, but all the previous options that\u00a0were open to me have now been\u00a0taken. I want to use my brain, to enjoy working with colleagues and to do something meaningful. This could be in any area, not just the NHS. I have an MSc in health studies and a BA in social sciences, and am a published author within two academic textbooks. I am in my 60s but continue to have an active brain and a great work ethic. Jeremy says I\u2019m not sure why the options that were open to you three years ago \u201chave now been taken\u201d. Do make sure that you\u2019ve fully explored these possibilities before finally abandoning them. Your writing ability made me think that you could probably build up a small business, working from home, helping small firms, perhaps ones with health connections, with their communications. That remains a possibility but, understandably, you say you want to enjoy working with colleagues \u2013 and that\u2019s certainly one of the pleasures that going out to work provides. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an obvious job description for what you\u2019d like to do, or if there is I haven\u2019t thought of it. But I am going to suggest a practical course of action. Your first move must be to draw up and print a simple synopsis of your interests, qualifications and contact details \u2013 a sort of CV. Then you should make a realistic assumption: that somewhere within a certain radius of your house there must be at least one business or organisation that would benefit from your involvement. It might be a school, for example, or a hospital or care home. Then you need to do a painstaking search within that defined area, making a note of any such firm that might just be interested in what you have to offer. Once you have done that, approach each one directly, always leaving a copy of your CV behind. I know it sounds arduous, but I believe that\u2019s the most likely way for you to find what you\u2019re looking for. Readers say \u2022 Volunteering is worthwhile and life-affirming, but I would also recommend taking up activities new to you. Since retiring I have developed interests in classical music, watercolours and batik, and while I have moderate ability I thoroughly enjoy using my brain in different ways to before (I was an engineer turned maths teacher). stevekbk \u2022 Organisations such as Homestart look for part-time family liaison staff and volunteers. ajchm \u2022 If you have time on your hands the noblest thing I can think of, given your background, would be to do everything in your power to save the NHS. I\u2019m sure you could consult on matters and write open letters in response to statements and legislature proposed by the government. Juno Hoo  What can I do about a colleague who simply isn\u2019t up to the job? I have to work with a colleague who \u2013 not to put too fine a point on it \u2013 is fundamentally incompetent at his job. He occupies a mid-senior role and I\u2019m at a loss as to why he was hired in the first place or how he passed his probation. We are a website and he barely seems\u00a0to grasp how the internet works, let alone the relatively advanced levels\u00a0of analysis that his role demands. If\u00a0he\u00a0held a more junior position it would be more tolerable, but as it is he\u00a0is at best a dead weight, and at worst an annoyance. I am not alone in thinking this. In meetings his input causes an awkward pause as people attempt to digest that someone suggested such a bad idea. If you explain why it is not viable (and in most cases would likely be harmful to the business) and methodically list your\u00a0points, he will just repeat his initial idea as if he didn\u2019t hear anything you said. He was hired by another team, with\u00a0whom he passed his probation, and is now being foisted on us. Our company embraces \u201cagile management\u201d where you have a fluid structure of partly self-sufficient business units, and personnel moving between these is encouraged. Infuriatingly, he\u2019s keen to remain with our team as we\u2019re \u201csuch nice guys\u201d. I can only assume this is because we\u2019re generally polite to him. I work closely with him and he is a drain on my time. I\u2019m unsure as to how to proceed. I am sure you can sense my sheer frustration, but I don\u2019t like the idea of getting someone fired. Jeremy says \u201cAgile management\u201d? This \u201cfluid structure\u201d seems designed to enable management to escape the consequences of their mistakes. It\u2019s entirely wrong that you should find yourself in this position. The responsibility for assessing this person\u2019s ability, and for taking any necessary action as a result of that assessment, lies not with you but with the team that hired him and saw him through his probationary period. It must surely be agreed that successful teams are highly dependent on personal chemistry \u2013 a star in one team may be a dog in another. Taking advantage of your fluid structure and the encouraged practice of personnel moving between your partly self-sufficient business units, make it clear \u2013 on behalf of your whole team \u2013 that this particular character, though obviously well regarded by the team that took him on, is an unacceptable member of yours. By requesting that he returns to his original team you\u2019re not getting him fired. You\u2019re saying that it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest, including his, that he rejoins a group where his contribution will be appreciated. This puts the responsibility for dealing with him squarely back where it belongs. Readers say \u2022 Put up with it. Lots of people are incompetent and it sounds like the hiring manager and his probation supervisor were also incompetent. He will probably be promoted to your manager before long, so be nice to him. With a bit of luck you\u2019ll soon have an (even more) incompetent manager. Tobemon \u2022 Keep sending him \u201chelpful\u201d email links for training courses that might be of use to him. Or links for jobs \u201cthat he would be really good at\u201d. ID8917109  \u2022 You\u2019re lucky you only have one desk zombie. I work with someone who falls asleep daily for extended periods and this nap time is probably when he is at his most productive. In my organisation the dangerously incompetent get shunted around from section to section until they land in some corner where they can\u2019t do any harm. BaddHamster \u2022 Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not your job to manage this guy, it\u2019s his manager\u2019s. If it gets to the stage where he forces some terrible decision on you, go over his head. Otherwise just carry on \u2013 you get paid the same. OverThereByTheDoor Do you need advice on a work issue?
