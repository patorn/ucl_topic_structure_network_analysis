Four Seasons has 440 care homes with 18,500 residents, but Moody\u2019s said its financial position was unsustainable. Last week, the company reported an annual pre-tax loss of \u00a3264m after writing down the value of the care homes it owns by a third due to the pressure on the industry. Four Seasons is also struggling under the weight of more than \u00a3500m of debt, making interest payments of \u00a352.1m last year.   Related: Is private equity really fit to run care homes? | Graham Ruddick    Tim Snow, a senior analyst at Moody\u2019s, warned the outlook for the group was opaque because the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d (NLW) has led to an increase in costs and it is not clear whether councils will help to fund this by increasing the fees they pay towards residents\u2019 care. He said profit growth over the next two years would not be substantial and was \u201csubject to vulnerabilities\u201d and that Four Seasons\u2019 ability to raise money by selling off property was diminishing.  As a result, Moody\u2019s said, the company \u201cwill not be able to service material levels of cash to pay debt going forward\u201d and a debt-for-equity swap with lenders was the most likely outcome. Four Seasons\u2019 lenders include US investment firms HCP and H/2 Capital Partners.  The company hit back at the dire warning, insisting it has \u201cmedium-term flexibility\u201d in its finances, with auditors signing off the accounts last week as a going concern.  Robbie Barr, the chairman, said the quality of care in the company\u2019s homes had not been affected by financial pressures \u2013 with three homes blocked from taking new residents by the regulator compared with a peak of 28. However, Barr admitted that Four Seasons needed to restructure its finances.  Four Seasons is at the forefront of the funding crisis facing the care home industry. Care homes are being squeezed by a decline in the fees that cash-strapped local authorities pay towards residents\u2019 care and a rise in staff costs caused by the introduction of the \u00a37.20 an hour NLW, which came into force on 1 April.   Related: Care home crisis won\u2019t be solved by just paying more, says Justin King    The chancellor, George Osborne, has allowed councils to increase council tax by an extra 2% a year to help fund social care, and more than 90% of local authorities have introduced the levy by the maximum amount.  However, Moody\u2019s warned these funds may not fill the financial shortfall facing care homes.  Snow said: \u201cEven though we understand that over 90% of local authorities have opted to implement the full 2% increase in 2016/17, it remains unclear both how this additional funding will be spent and to what extent the full precept will be raised in future years. \u201cAt the same time, we do not believe that there is significant scope to recover the effective underfunding of fee settlements from previous years and we do not therefore foresee a material positive transformation in [profits] performance over the next 12 to 24 months.  \u201cWe also believe that against the backdrop of an industry-wide shortage of permanently employed nurses there are further vulnerabilities associated with reliance on agency staff and wage costs more generally, albeit that we acknowledge the progress made around agency personnel.\u201d",
