Underdevelopment, soil erosion, sand dune encroachment, a chronic shortage of water \u2013 these all keep people poor and scrabbling to survive. Now though, after a punishing year of aerial bombing in the Middle East\u2019s \u201cforgotten conflict\u201d, there\u2019s another threat to Yemen\u2019s rural workers: vast amounts of unexploded ordnance, including cluster bombs - which are banned by over 100 countries, although not in Saudi Arabia. Bizarrely. and grotesquely, local farmers and goat herders say that so many cluster bombs have been fired into their villages, farms and surrounding countryside by the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition, that deadly submunitions \u2013 or \u201cbomblets\u201d \u2013 are found everywhere. In houses, courtyards, streets, fields used to graze livestock, around springs for water, and even, says one goat herder, \u201changing off the trees\u201d. Our staff from Amnesty International have recently visited the governorates of Sa\u2019dah, Hajjah and Sana\u2019a in northern Yemen. They found that indeed cluster bomblets and other munitions litter the area. A coalition fighting an insurgency of Houthi tribesmen and forces aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh has sprayed civilian areas with some of the foulest weaponry in the history of warfare.    One of the cluster bombs we saw in northern Yemen was made in the UK    Villagers told us about how people have been killed or maimed by the unexploded, but still live, bomblets. Amnesty has documented 10 incidents in which 16 civilians, including nine children, were killed or maimed by cluster bombs between July 2015 and last month. One boy of eight was killed while herding goats near a village in al-Safra directorate in Sa\u2019dah on 1 March. His 11-year-old brother also lost three fingers on one hand and needed steel plates inserted into his shattered jaw. These are likely to be only a fraction of the deadly harvest of cluster bomb casualties in Yemen. In just three weeks in April, an understaffed Yemeni mine-clearance organisation cleared at least 418 cluster bomb submunitions, as well as 51 mortars and more than 70 missiles from the area we visited. The clearance was abruptly halted after three de-miners were themselves killed. Meanwhile, an unknown number of the bomblets remain uncollected, awaiting their next victim. The cluster bombing of northern villages is of course just one part of a greater, altogether more depressing Yemen story. Under its controversial young defence minister Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s gung-ho coalition of predominantly Gulf states has for more than a year remorselessly \u2013 and often indiscriminately \u2013 bombarded whole swaths of Yemen. A UN report in January found there had been at least 119 coalition attacks (many with multiple airstrikes) in clear breach of the laws of war \u2013 on houses, schools, wedding parties, hospitals and refugee camps. Thousands of civilians have been killed (at least 3,200), with the coalition responsible for the greater part (on their side the Houthi-Saleh fighters haven\u2019t spared civilians either). The Saudis admit they\u2019ve used cluster bombs, but say it was against armoured vehicles not unarmed civilians. Our evidence casts these claims into serious doubt. Tragic though all of this is, some might ask what does it have to do with us? It\u2019s just another regional Middle Eastern conflict, isn\u2019t it? Well, not quite. Because the UK has provided chief belligerent Saudi Arabia with much of its huge arsenal of weaponry. British arms manufacturers have sold literally billions of pounds of war planes, missiles and bombs to oil-rich Saudi Arabia. Large consignments of Typhoon jets and missiles (\u00a32.8bn\u2019s worth) have continued to be sent to Riyadh even as the civilian death toll in neighbouring Yemen has mounted. Challenged on why it continues to issue such arms export licences to British arms companies, the UK government has ducked and dived shamelessly. We\u2019ve checked with our Saudi Arabian \u201callies\u201d, ministers say, and they assure is that there\u2019s been no deliberate targeting of civilians (as if deliberation were all that mattered). Or: we\u2019ve checked again and Saudi Arabia has told us they\u2019re conducting an inquiry. Or: there\u2019s no evidence that British weaponry had been involved.   Related: Who\u2019s making sure the Saudi bombs keep falling on Yemen? The Tories | David Wearing    Well now there is. One of the cluster bombs we saw in northern Yemen was made in the UK. To be precise, it\u2019s a BL755 device made and exported by a Bedfordshire-based firm called Hunting Engineering Ltd prior to the ban on such devices coming in to force. It contains 147 bomblets designed to burn through tank armour and then explode into more than 2,000 metal fragments. The BL755 was designed to be dropped from Tornado fighter jets, scores of which the UK has sold to Saudi Arabia. Did a Saudi Arabian pilot drop this cluster bomb \u2013 and others like it \u2013 on al-Khadra village in Yemen? We need to know. The BL755, a barbaric bit of British kit has turned up in the killing fields of Yemen. Just how involved is the UK in leaving the poisoned fruits of war scattered among the farmers and goatherds of impoverished Yemen? \u2022 Amnesty International \u2013 which is calling on the UK to halt all arms exports to Saudi Arabia and other members of the military coalition that could be used to commit further human rights violations in Yemen \u2013 has written to David Cameron to ascertain the full circumstances surrounding UK cluster munitions being used in Yemen, including full disclosure over whether any British personnel or officials were involved",
