  "body": "Vice-president Joe Biden admitted defeat on passing stricter gun laws at the federal level, telling local leaders Tuesday: \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going to get much more done in the next nine months.\u201d But he urged state and local politicians to continue fighting.  \u201cDon\u2019t quit on this,\u201d he said, at a meeting in Washington of local politicians from 48 states. Biden urged them to \u201cset the table\u201d for the next president \u201cto be able to get some of this done\u201d. He also touted the White House\u2019s push to develop personalized \u201csmart guns\u201d, arguing that safer guns could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in a country that has almost as many firearms as people.

It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d  Biden\u2019s speech came after a weekend of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton facing off on guns. After being endorsed by the National Rifle Association on Friday, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, told NRA members that he would eliminate gun-free zones and warned that Clinton \u201cwants to abolish the second amendment\u201d. On Saturday in Florida, Clinton told an audience of black mothers who had lost children to gun violence that a Trump presidency would put \u201cmore kids at risk of violence and bigotry\u201d. She called Trump\u2019s proposals \u201cway out there\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d. Clinton has pledged to take on the NRA from her first day in office, including fighting for expanded background checks on gun sales and a new ban on assault weapons.

The Connecticut and Colorado governors went on to face tough reelection campaigns where they were attacked for their record on guns. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken some real changes, you\u2019ve taken some real hits, and you\u2019ve made real progress,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental change affecting the whole state. It can be contagious.\u201d  With Congress more dysfunctional than he had ever seen it, Biden said, the frontline of policy change had moved to states and cities on several issues, including gun control and increasing the minimum wage. \u201cJust because we have not been able to get it done nationally, with this Congress, does not mean that you cannot change a lot of the parameters of these issues at home,\u201d he said.

The ballot measure strategy is being advanced and funded by national gun control groups, including Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by billionaire former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Biden also said personalized smart gun technology \u201ccould have gigantic payoff for us\u201d, especially because gun ownership in America is a constitutional right.  \u201cWhether you like it or not, there is a second amendment. It is real. It exists. It must be upheld,\u201d Biden said.  Americans own roughly 300m guns. But smart gun technology could help make guns safer and prevent them from being used by children or people other than their authorized owners, Biden said.  He said he had talked to two gun shop owners who faced backlash after saying they would sell rifles with smart gun technology.  \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the pressure that\u2019s being brought by the NRA and others not to allow this technology to go forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not be cowed.\u201d  The NRA\u2019s official position is that it does not oppose smart gun technology, only legal requirements that would force the adoption of the technology. In a brief afternoon press conference outside the White House, Connecticut governor Dan Malloy and other local leaders praised Obama and Biden. Malloy credited the White House for resurrecting a Democratic focus on guns that had been largely abandoned since 1994, when Democratic leaders passed a ban on assault weapons and then saw sweeping Republican victories in the midterm elections.  Biden told local leaders that the White House would keep attention on the issue, even if little action was possible on the federal level.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep beating the drum,\u201d he said.",
