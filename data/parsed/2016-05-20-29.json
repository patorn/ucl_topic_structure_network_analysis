  "body": "Jo Pavey\u2019s ambition to become the first British female athlete to run in five Olympics faces a make-or-break test on Saturday night at the Parliament Hill athletics track, London when she competes at the UK 10,000m trials. Pavey, who will be a month shy of her 43rd birthday when the Games begin in Rio, will be automatically selected if she finishes among the top two British athletes and runs the qualifying time of 32min 15sec by the end of July. And while she has not raced in 2016, the whispers are that she is showing strong form in training. Pavey, who became an overnight sensation at the age of 40 when she won the European 10,000m title in Zurich two years ago, faces a tough test against two 24-year-olds, Kate Avery and Beth Potter, who have already achieved the Olympic qualifying mark. Even so, she is happy to be in the mix.   Related: Dafne Schippers builds up to Rio Olympics on streets of Manchester    \u201cI thought I would be retired by now so it is a bonus to still be thinking about competing,\u201d she said recently. \u201cRio is a massive target, to try to make a fifth Olympics.\u201d In the men\u2019s race Andy Vernon, who was controversially left out of the British team for last year\u2019s world championships, is a strong favourite to book his place for Rio in the absence of Mo Farah, who will be given an automatic place. Kenenisa Bekele, the world 5,000m and 10,000m record holder, says Farah has a \u201cbig chance\u201d to repeat his gold medal winning heroics in Rio but must attempt to break his world records to be considered the best middle-distance runner of all time. \u201cHe has achieved a lot with Olympics and world championships but he needs to take the challenge of the clock to take my crown,\u201d said Bekele, who thinks Farah would have a 50-50 chance of toppling his times if he committed himself to chasing records not medals. When asked whether there would be something missing in Farah\u2019s career if he did not break either the world 5,000m or 10,000m record, Bekele replied: \u201cOf course. If someone is not beating those records, you have to limit him in the order of great runners. If he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to do that, and if he doesn\u2019t try, something will be missing.\u201d Meanwhile CJ Ujah says Britain\u2019s 4x100m team are \u201call sweet\u201d after their spectacular falling out at the world championships final in Beijing. Tempers flared after James Ellington was unable to get the baton to Ujah, which left Britain without a medal or a qualifying time for Rio, but Ujah said a series of training camps has mended fences and put the team in a good frame of mind before their first outing of the season at Loughborough on Sunday. \u201cOur recent practice in Italy was really good and positive,\u201d Ujah said. \u201cEveryone agreed it was our best camp, so hopefully we\u2019ll put down a marker at Loughborough and see what happens. Our demons from Beijing are gone. We sat down and spoke in January, we\u2019ve come back and we\u2019re all settled now, it\u2019s all sweet.\u201d Ujah also praised the young sprinter Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, who missed the national record by 0.01sec as he became only the third Briton to run under 20sec for 200m. The 22-year-old ran 19.95sec representing Louisiana State University at the Southeastern Conference Championships in Alabama last week \u2013 just outside John Regis\u2019s record of 19.94sec but ahead of Adam Gemili\u2019s 19.98sec. \u201cNethaneel\u2019s an amazing guy,\u201d Ujah said. \u201cI think out of all the sprinters I probably know him best, because I went to the World Youths with him in 2011 and then I went to the European Juniors with him. I know he hasn\u2019t had an easy road with injuries and other things setting him back, it\u2019s good to see him come out and run what he\u2019s capable of running. Hopefully he\u2019ll come over to the UK trials in June and stamp his authority.\u201d",
