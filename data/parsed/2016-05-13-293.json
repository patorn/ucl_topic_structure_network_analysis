  "body": "The chief executive of Tesco, Dave Lewis, was paid \u00a34.6m including a \u00a33m bonus last year, when he stabilised the crisis-hit retailer and returned it to profit. The UK\u2019s largest supermarket group has experienced an upturn in sales amid the ongoing price war but the outlook for profits remains gloomy. Tesco made a pretax profit of \u00a3162m in the year to 27 February, after slumping \u00a36.4bn into the red the year before \u2013 the biggest loss ever recorded on the UK high street. Lewis received a salary of \u00a31.3m, a short-term annual bonus of \u00a32.99m, benefits worth \u00a380,000 and a \u00a3313,000 contribution to his pension, the company\u2019s annual report showed (pdf). His total package of \u00a34.6m rose from \u00a34.1m the previous year, after he joined in September 2014 to take the reins from Philip Clarke who was sacked. His package that year was boosted by a \u00a33.2m \u201cgolden hello\u201d \u2013 to compensate for bonuses forfeited at his former employer, Unilever. The second-best-paid executive at Tesco was the finance chief, Alan Stewart, who was paid \u00a32.6m last year. He got a \u00a31.6m bonus on top of his \u00a3750,000 salary. He also joined in September 2014, from Marks & Spencer. Earlier this year, Tesco announced a 3.1% increase in basic pay for staff \u2013 nearly 250,000 employees \u2013 but the new deal also included cuts to holiday and night-time bonuses. Despite the pay rise, Tesco\u2019s terms and conditions lag behind rivals Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl. Deanna Oppenheimer, who chairs Tesco\u2019s remuneration committee, explained the executive pay policy: \u201cStretching 2015-16 annual bonus targets were set last year in the context of significant uncertainty and volatility for both Tesco and the retail sector, at a time when nearly all key indicators in the business were on a steep, negative trend.\u201d     Dave Lewis.

In particular, the group has achieved increased volumes and positive like-for-like sales, reduced costs, increased cash flow, and completed significant disposals and business restructuring to strengthen the balance sheet.\u201d Oppenheimer said financial targets for sales and operating profit, representing 80% of the bonus, were met almost fully for both Lewis and Stewart. The annual bonus will pay out at 95.7% of the maximum with half due to be deferred into shares under Tesco policy.  Both executives offered to defer more of their cash bonus into shares, to \u201cdemonstrate their commitment to the business at this early stage of the turnaround,\u201d she said, so 75% of the bonus has been deferred into shares. They are due to pay out in July 2018 or when the company resumes dividend payments. Lewis also holds just over 100,000 ordinary shares in the business, worth \u00a31.56m at the current share price of 155.45p, while Stewart owns nearly 51,000 shares, worth nearly \u00a3788,000.",
