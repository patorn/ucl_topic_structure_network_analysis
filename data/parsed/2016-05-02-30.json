  "body": "The White House has faced tough questioning over comedian Larry Wilmore\u2019s use of a taboo racial slur at its annual correspondents dinner. Press secretary Josh Earnest was challenged repeatedly by April Ryan, an African American journalist and author of The Presidency in Black and White, who suggested that many people in the room were \u201cappalled\u201d by the N-word being uttered to the president\u2019s face. Earnest said that Barack Obama appreciated \u201cthe spirit\u201d of Wilmore\u2019s remark. Wilmore, who is African American, ended his after-dinner speech on Saturday by recognising the historical significance of America\u2019s first black president, pounding his chest and telling Obama: \u201cWords alone do me no justice. So, Mr President, if I\u2019m going to keep it 100: yo, Barry, you did it, my nigga.\u201d The comment immediately divided people both in the room and beyond. Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post blogged: \u201cNever before has the n-word been used to address the president. At least, not in public and most definitely not to his face. That\u2019s why Wilmore\u2019s use of it was as shocking as it was disrespectful.\u201d At Monday\u2019s daily press briefing at the White House, the issue was raised by Ryan, Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks. She described it as \u201ca word that is one of the worst words, many people say, you could say to anyone\u201d. Earnest did not address this directly but noted that following Obama\u2019s act at the annual dinner is \u201cone of the most difficult tasks in comedy\u201d, since the president has shown himself \u201cadept\u201d at delivering one-liners and so expects comedians to go \u201cright up to the line\u201d. But Ryan pressed further: \u201cMany African Americans in that room \u2013 who included civil rights leaders, black comedians \u2013 were very appalled. ... Black Republicans were upset, black Democrats were upset. People felt that not just throwing it at him, he threw it at them, and also, it diminished the office of the presidency and it diminished him. Did he cross the line?\u201d Earnest responded: \u201cApril, what I would say is it\u2019s not the first time that people on the Monday after the White House correspondents dinner have observed that the comedian on Saturday night crossed the line.\u201d  He cited the examples of Stephen Colbert, who in 2006 memorably roasted George W Bush, and Wanda Sykes, who in 2009 joked about the 11 September terrorist attacks. \u201cSo it\u2019s not the first time that we\u2019ve had a conversation like this in which these of kinds of concerns have been raised or expressed. \u201cLook, I had an opportunity to speak to the president about this briefly this morning and he said that he appreciated the spirit of the sentiments that Mr Wilmore expressed.\u201d Reflecting on Wilmore\u2019s routine, which also targeted some journalists and left them stony-faced, Earnest added: \u201cHe ended his speech by saying that he couldn\u2019t put into words the pride that he felt in this president and he made the observation that our country has made remarkable progress just in his lifetime from not being willing to accept an African American quarterback to electing and re-electing an African American not just to lead the United States but to lead the free world. \u201cAgain, I take Mr Wilmore at his words that he found that to be a powerful transformation just in his lifetime and something that he seemed to be pretty obviously proud of.\u201d But Ryan wondered if Wilmore\u2019s use of \u201cfree speech\u201d gave the president\u2019s detractors fodder to use it against him. Earnest said he had no idea and would not spend much time worrying about it. Ryan then made reference to a podcast interview that Obama gave last June in which he himself used the slur to argue that, despite great progress, racism is still pervasive in America. The president said at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of it not being polite to say \u2018nigger\u2019 in public. That\u2019s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not.\u201d Wilmore, by contrast, used it for the president \u201csomewhat as the butt of a joke\u201d, Ryan contended. \u201cYou were in that room as well as I was,\u201d she told Earnest. \u201cThere was an eerie, awkward silence and quietness. People didn\u2019t know how to handle that.\u201d The press secretary countered: \u201cI\u2019m confident that Mr Wilmore used the word by design \u2013 he was seeking to be provocative \u2013 but I think any reading of his comments makes clear he was not using the president as the butt of a joke. \u201cWhat is true is that this is a tough assignment that any comedian takes on when they sign up for this job and the president\u2019s expectation when he walks in that room is that that comedian and other people are going to get much closer to the line than they ordinarily would as they try to make a joke.\u201d Ryan noted other problematic terms that littered Wilmore\u2019s routine. \u201cI just want to be very clear,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the president is OK with his use and how he used the N-word, \u2018jigaboo\u2019, \u2018negro nation\u2019 and \u2018thug\u2019?\u201d Earnest\u2019s response referred back to the president saying he appreciated \u201cthe spirit\u201d of Wilmore\u2019s expressions on Saturday night. Later, he said the White House did not see or vet Wilmore\u2019s remarks before they were delivered but he felt they came from \u201ca genuine place\u201d.",
