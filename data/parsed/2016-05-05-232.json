  "body": "The alternative, cheaper scheme to expand Heathrow airport should be put back on the table if the government gives the go-ahead for a new runway, according to the boss of British Airways\u2019 owner. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, whose airlines, including BA, operate the majority of services at Heathrow, said he did not expect a decision soon \u2013 but the \u201cprohibitive costs\u201d meant ministers should not be bound to the airport\u2019s own proposals for a third, north-west runway. The Airports Commission gave a clear recommendation in 2015 to go ahead with Heathrow\u2019s official scheme rather than the independent hub proposal, which would double the length of the existing northern runway to allow landing and takeoff on the same strip.    Related: Heathrow airport at 70: from tents to terminals \u2013 in pictures    However, the Heathrow hub was shortlisted as a viable proposition in the commission\u2019s interim report alongside a second runway at Gatwick, an option that the government said it is still considering. Walsh said that it was an \u201cinteresting concept\u201d, adding: \u201cIf you look at Heathrow you\u2019ve got to open your mind ... If it gets the nod you\u2019ve got to look seriously at both of the options.\u201d He said the hub proposal, developed by the former Concorde pilot Jock Lowe, would cost a \u201chell of a lot less\u201d than the \u00a323bn price \u2013 including new roads \u2013 that the commission estimated Heathrow\u2019s third runway plan would cost.     Walsh described the independent hub proposal as a interesting concept. Photograph: Niall Carson/PA    Walsh said: \u201cI honestly can\u2019t see how you can spend that much money on an airport and not discourage people from flying there.\u201d  Landing charges for airlines would go up significantly to finance the construction, according to the commission. Walsh added: \u201cWe have to look not only at whether the demand exists \u2013 which I believe it does \u2013 but whether you can match that demand with something that\u2019s affordable.\u201d He contrasted Heathrow\u2019s costs with a similar scheme in Dublin, the base of one of BA\u2019s sister airlines in IAG, Aer Lingus. \u201cThe airport is talking about building a second runway at a tiny fraction of the cost of the Heathrow third \u2013 \u00a3350m against \u00a323bn. \u201cIt gives us an attractive option to continue to grow on the transatlantic and serve cities in Britain and Europe that we won\u2019t be able to connect through Heathrow.\u201d The frontrunners in Thursday\u2019s London mayoral election, Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan and Conservative Zac Goldsmith, both oppose Heathrow expansion and back Gatwick. Walsh warned bluntly on Gatwick: \u201cI don\u2019t think the business case exists.\u201d He said most airlines only chose to operate at Gatwick if they could not get in to Heathrow, particularly on business routes. The IAG chief executive was speaking aboard British Airways\u2019 inaugural flight from Heathrow to San Jose in California \u2013 the first direct link from Europe to the airport closest to the Silicon Valley HQs of Apple, eBay, Google and other tech companies. \u2018I\u2019m not leaving IAG. This is my last job\u2019 Walsh insisted he will not be retiring imminently, despite previously having said he would be stepping down at 55 \u2013 an age he will reach in October. He said he was fitter than ever after a dramatic recent weight loss that he ascribed to kicking a 12-a-day cappuccino habit and turning to salads in the IAG office. Walsh said: \u201cAs a pilot, retirement age was 55. I was getting used to the idea. Now that I\u2019m approaching that age, I\u2019m realising that 55 is very, very young. \u201cI foolishly made those comments some time ago and I\u2019m never afraid to admit when I got it wrong. There\u2019s a lot more [to do]. I\u2019m not leaving IAG. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is my last job.\u201d",
