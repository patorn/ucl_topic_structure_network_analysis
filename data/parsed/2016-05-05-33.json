  "body": "The editor-in-chief of Mamamia has said it \u201cdidn\u2019t enter our minds\u201d that listing a two-week \u201cintensive\u201d internship at a charity auction \u2013 that sold for $10,000 \u2013 would prompt criticisms of exploitation. The silent auction was held at a lunch in Sydney on Thursday organised by the Women for the World fundraising group for the Catholic charity Caritas Australia. Mamamia\u2019s contribution was a three-month day-a-week or \u201ctwo-week intensive\u201d internship \u201cto the adventurous individual\u201d. \u201cEnvisage yourself working alongside a senior editor with opportunities to pitch original ideas, harness social media skills, work with online media, and gain exclusive insights,\u201d a description of the listing read. It had been \u201ckindly donated by Mia Freedman\u201d, with its value listed as \u201cpriceless\u201d.     Tweet from Michael Roddan about the donation for auction of an internship with Mamamia in support of Caritas Australia.

Photograph: Twitter    Priceless the opportunity may be, a price was found for it, with Channel 9 personality and the event\u2019s MC, Ben Fordham, tweeting that it sold for $10,000. The identity of the buyer is not known. Mamamia editor-in-chief Kate De Brito told Guardian Australia the publication \u201cdonated an internship\u201d to the auction at the request of Caritas Australia, and that she agreed \u201cbecause we were happy to support such a worthwhile cause\u201d. \u201cIt didn\u2019t enter our minds when we were approached ... that we would be accused of benefiting from the process.\u201d \u201cValue: Priceless\u201d was written by the event organisers, De Brito said. De Brito said hundreds of people applied for internship positions at Mamamia every year of which \u201conly a handful\u201d were accepted. Of those, about 25% were offered paid positions at the end of their internship. \u201cThe benefit for Mamamia comes in making contact with bright, talented women who are keen to work in media. \u201cWe are proud of the fact that many of our permanent Mamamia staff began their careers as interns with the company. We are also hugely proud of our intern program, it\u2019s a big resource commitment for us and we were happy to extend it in this instance to raise $10k for charity.\u201d De Brito did not say whether interns were paid or received university credit (though she said Mamamia worked closely with \u201cvery supportive\u201d universities on its program). Clarification has been sought on this point. She said Mamamia currently employed 35 full-time and part-time editorial staff, all of whom were paid \u2013 as were its casual employees. Fordham defended the listing on Thursday, pointing to the $10,000 it raised for charity.    To any who knocked @Mamamia for donating an internship to Caritas, it just raised 10K for women in developing world pic.twitter.com/KIGWNOJXfS\u2014 BenFordham (@BenFordham) May 5, 2016    But he received a critical response.    @_wkelly_ @BenFordham And tax deductible @Mamamia\u2014 Michelle Roberts (@shellzzz) May 5, 2016    De Brito responded to Fordham\u2019s tweet to say Mamamia was \u201chappy to\u201d donate the internship at the request of Caritas Australia. The replies to her statement were similarly scathing.    @BenFordham @Mamamia Thanks Ben, we were happy to donate the internship which was specially requested by the Caritas organisers.\u2014 Kate de Brito (@AskBossy) May 5, 2016      @AskBossy @BenFordham @Mamamia you'd do better and it would be in the spirit of the event to donate internships to underprivileged women\u2014 Rachael Lonergan (@RachaelHasIdeas) May 5, 2016      C'mon, someone profile mamamia's $10k internship winner and tell me about merit and hard work and a fair go for all\u2014 Asher Wolf (@Asher_Wolf) May 5, 2016    Freedman has had to defend the website from accusations of underpaying writers or publishing them without payment in the past. In 2012, she wrote that 70% of the content published on the site was written by four full-time and two part-time staff. . \u201cSome in the Twittersphere would have you believe that these writers live in cages on under my desk and when they get cold in winter, I set fire to a pile of $100 notes so their fingers thaw out enough to keep typing,\u201d she wrote then. \u201cOur other contributors \u2013 those who aren\u2019t employed by Mamamia \u2013 provide us with their work on a voluntary basis. This is not unusual. On Friday morning Freedman called on Twitter users to \u201cpark their sanctimony & outrage\u201d and defended Mamamia\u2019s internship program in a statement.    So much wild and inaccurate tweeting & news coverage about @Mamamia Women's Network, our intern program and the auctioning of an internship.\u2014 Mia Freedman (@MiaFreedman) May 5, 2016      Statement to come shortly. Meanwhile can I suggest everyone park their sanctimony & outrage. Even just momentarily. Can you do that Twitter?\u2014 Mia Freedman (@MiaFreedman) May 5, 2016      The issue of internships is likely to come under greater scrutiny in Australia since the treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced a new federal scheme to help young people into employment in Tuesday\u2019s budget. The Youth Jobs Path program will make available 30,000 internships to young people who have been out of work for six months or more.   Related: Youth intern scheme will exploit workers and replace 'real jobs', say unions    Participants would work between 15 to 25 hours per week for between four and 12 weeks, in exchange for a payment of $200 a fortnight on top of their regular income support payment. Businesses that took them on would receive a one-off payment of $1,000. Morrison described the scheme as \u201creal work for the dole\u201d. But concerns have been raised that it will provide businesses with cheap labour while leaving inexperienced young workers vulnerable to exploitation, and it is not yet clear how the scheme will be monitored. The executive director of Interns Australia, Dimity Mannering, said the \u201c$4-per-hour\u201d internships called for \u201cserious reflection\u201d from Morrison.   Related: Signs are not good for a budget based on 'jobs, growth and investment'    \u201cIn real life, this may end up being a significantly underpaid work trial,\u201d she said. Mannering also expressed concern that businesses would prefer to take on underpaid interns rather than making full-time hires. \u201cIf you can access labour for less than the legal wage, why would you pay for a worker on a proper wage?\u201d she said. Interns Australia research shows that 19% of unpaid interns and 35% of paid interns receive job offers from the employer with whom they intern.",
