But this time, the club\u2019s exit to the tax haven that is The People\u2019s Stadium of East London has sparked all manner of hoo-ha, with supporters celebrating the club\u2019s new status as a government asset by pelting the Manchester United bus with empty bottles of Rowdiness Enabler in the run-up to the The Last Game At The Boleyn Ground. Reacting as they have done all season to adversity, the Manchester United players all lay down and rolled over, then filmed the siege from within their bus on camera-phones as they struggled to reach the ground through the crowd. Crumbling, unfit for purpose and soon to be decommissioned, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal partly held the bus attack responsible for his side\u2019s 3-2 defeat: \u201cWe cannot cope with the circumstance before the match, that\u2019s unusual. I\u2019ve had that experience, but my players have not so it has an influence.\u201d   Related: David Sullivan and West Ham illustrate how not to handle a crisis | Ed Aarons    West Ham owner Gollivan was initially quick to blame the incident on Manchester United for flagrantly attempting to turn up to the ground before kick-off as scheduled, adding that the subsequently delayed kick-off meant some fans would have to miss the post-match abomination of a party. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why United couldn\u2019t get here at 4pm,\u201d it parped. \u201cThey could have got here early. They knew it would be busy. It\u2019s crazy. There were people around the coach, but there was no attack on the coach. If you check the coach there won\u2019t be any damage to it.\u201d Having checked the coach and discovered there was quite a bit of damage to it, he later revised his opinion, saying: \u201cI want to apologise to Manchester United for that damage and assure them that we will be doing all we can to track down those responsible and ban them for life.\u201d West Ham chief suit Karren Brady pointed out that \u201cWest Ham is a family club\u201d, comments which were duly reported in articles which carried pictures of women and children running for cover outside said family club in debris- and smoke-filled streets full of police and Tin-drinking fans. The fireworks before the match overshadowed, in every sense, the fireworks that followed it as West Ham unveiled the sort of light show that had all the hallmarks of a kids\u2019 birthday party in Laser Quest circa 1991. Paolo Di Canio turned up dressed as Rupert Bear, Teddy Sheringham wore a flat cap and fans ripped out seats in the family spirit. All in all, it meant that those supporters who Gollivan said would have to miss out were probably better off than those who didn\u2019t.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt was a handball obviously but it obviously wasn\u2019t deliberate. The motion of my tackle brings my body shape round that way and my hand goes on the ball. It was a handball but the referee got it right\u201d \u2013 Falkirk\u2019s David McCracken brazenly shrugs off his team\u2019s penalty escape during their Premiership play-off semi-final first leg at Hibs, which finished 2-2.

How low, how disgusting.\u201d 11.16am: \u201cI apologise unreservedly if anyone thought I was making that connection.\u201d     Mouth.

Don\u2019t get dizzy now\u201d \u2013 Stephen Lenthall. \u201cI expect less of you, Fiver. Much less. I can\u2019t be bothered to check, but it appears that yesterday\u2019s Fiver involved research that went well beyond Wikipedia. Wouldn\u2019t it have been far easier to rattle off a half-baked cautionary tale about the fate that awaits those who leave the Boleyn Ground/Castle to live off the generosity of the government and then fail to deliver? Perhaps you\u2019re hoping to use that one in September\u201d \u2013 Thomas Reimer. \u201cI\u2019m sure that your account of the history of the Boleyn Ground is riddled full of inaccuracies and incorrect facts that I would love to pedant upon. However, I found the account of such things so boring I couldn\u2019t actually finish reading it, and as such was unable to accumulate a sufficient number of historical accuracies to justify any pedantry\u201d \u2013 Sam Crocker. \u201cI have a proposal that might help you to avoid the opprobrium of readers enraged that you failed to cover the recent achievements of their team (yesterday\u2019s letters). To paraphrase Mark Corrigan, discussing the news with Jez and Nancy: The Fiver should just be a dispassionate list of all the events that have occurred the world over during the day. That would be good. Except, of course, it would take forever. On the bright side, there might be a few more laughs\u201d \u2013 James Bolle. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

J\u00fcrgen Klopp is ready to inflict more misery on his old club Borussia Dortmund by pinching Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 from under their noses, shelling out a cool \u00a328m for the Rennes forward.

Internet dancing sensation and sometime Crystal Palace player Joe Ledley is out of the FA Cup with fibula-snap. He still hopes to be David Brenting all over Euro 2016, mind. Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson has huffed off from the SPFL board in protest at the club\u2019s three-point deduction for including ineligible players in the win against Inverness. \u201cOur travelling fans are the ones who have been punished the most here,\u201d sniffed a club statement. Riyad Mahrez has been named Leicester City\u2019s player of the year after 17 goals and 11 assists in their title-winning season. \u201cI love all the Leicester fans because they are great supporters,\u201d he cooed. Spain\u2019s first openly gay referee, Jes\u00fas Tomillero, has walked away from football due to the abuse he has received, saying he \u201ccannot take any more\u201d. The FA has been threatened with a \u00a330m cut in funding by culture secretary John Whittingdale. \u201cI will be writing to the FA to make clear that if they don\u2019t make sufficient progress on reform, they will not get a penny of taxpayers\u2019 money in the future,\u201d he parped.

Can any club outside London beat that? Everyone knows The Knowledge loves trains. Also featuring relegated teams who weren\u2019t in the drop zone all season. Public money\u2019s West Ham fancy Jamie Vardy, Christian Benteke, Sadio Man\u00e9, Alexandre Lacazette and Michy Batshuayi. Meanwhile, the best view in East London is about to get a lot less interesting.  Manchester United\u2019s defeat by West Ham hands the impetus back to Manchester City in the race for fourth place and Louis van Gaal\u2019s side may miss out on Europe altogether. And it would all be Liverpool\u2019s fault. You can still win tickets to Bobby M\u2019s leaving do here. And it\u2019s play-off agony time.
