The winding path this observation took after it was recorded, however, traces a century-long story leading through the transformation of both our understanding of the cosmos and the practice of astronomy itself.  Mercury\u2019s observer in this case was Willibald Pirckheimer, a German humanist who made diary notes in a set of astronomical tables by Johannes Regiomontanus, which are now preserved in the Royal Society Library. Pirckheimer almost certainly wasn\u2019t alone, as the same Mercury sighting (early in the evening of 18 March 1504) was recorded in more detail by his friend Bernhard Walther, who had inherited Regiomontanus\u2019 observation program and copious manuscripts. Perhaps it was solely an observing session, or perhaps it preceded one of the festive banquets Nuremberg\u2019s humanists were known for. We may not know the evening\u2019s full itinerary, but it\u2019s a reminder that science was rarely a solo activity even back then. What we do know, however, is the probable location where the sighting was made. When Walther died three months later, his sizeable house was purchased by Pirckheimer\u2019s best friend and fellow investigator of nature Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Today the house is a museum to D\u00fcrer\u2019s life and art, but if you walk around back, you can still see the observation ledge for astronomical instruments that Walther constructed beneath a top-floor window.

Photograph: Karl Galle     Walther\u2019s numerous and detailed observations, including some 746 midday solar altitudes, suggest he may have been trying to construct his own reformed model of celestial motions. Although he died before completing any theoretical work, the next generation of Nuremberg astronomers preserved his books and manuscripts \u2013 after Pirckheimer and D\u00fcrer purchased a few volumes from the estate for themselves \u2013 just as Walther had done for his mentor Regiomontanus. The observations themselves remained unpublished until a young Wittenberg professor named Georg Rheticus visited Nuremberg in early 1539 and then set off on the long trek to Frombork, where a church canon named Nicholas Copernicus was rumored to have developed a startling new theory putting the Sun rather than Earth at the center of the cosmos. When Rheticus returned carrying Copernicus\u2019s manuscript for the city\u2019s most famous printer, three of Walther\u2019s Mercury observations, including the one Pirckheimer recorded, were included in the final text. Two were incorrectly attributed to Johannes Sch\u00f6ner, then a caretaker for the Regiomontanus and Walther materials, but Sch\u00f6ner set the record straight by publishing Walther\u2019s complete observations the following year. From Copernicus to Kepler Why did Copernicus even need these Mercury observations at all? In the most basic historical accounts of his new cosmological theory, he simply switched the positions of the Earth and Sun, putting our planet into motion without really rearranging the other planets. In fact, the heliocentric idea appeared first as a brief outline in his book\u2019s opening leaves and was followed by over 350 pages of often brain-bending mathematical models for predicting the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets.

Photograph: Karl Galle/Linda Hall Library, Kansas City     The key to making these models work was having just enough measurements of key configurations \u2013 when planets were directly opposite or at greatest elongation from the Sun, for example \u2013 to compute mean motions over time. As the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury was notoriously difficult to spot, and Frombork\u2019s greater northern latitude made the problem worse by reducing the planet\u2019s vertical angle above the horizon. For this reason, even three of Walther\u2019s Mercury observations were enough to help fill out Copernicus\u2019s model of the planet\u2019s motions.  If opportunistically using a few decades-old measurements symbolises the astronomy of Copernicus\u2019s time, however, the imperfection of the results (after several rounds of calculations, Copernicus finally rounded Walther\u2019s numbers upward to make them better fit his models) were a stimulation to the astronomy that followed. In the coming decades, astronomers would no longer settle for averaging a handful of key measurements, instead embarking on increasingly ambitious programs to quantify celestial positions in every nightly configuration. Walther\u2019s simple window ledge thus gave way to ever larger instruments and observatories at Uraniborg and elsewhere.  Walther\u2019s observations did not disappear, however. On the contrary, having accurate measurements from the more distant past remained a key part of refining the long-term accuracy of astronomical tables. The value of this quotidian grind of observing and number-crunching is often forgotten in histories that emphasize a few big ideas like heliocentrism or elliptical orbits, but nothing encapsulates its core role in early astronomy like Kepler\u2019s nearly three decades of slaving over his Rudolphine Tables, drawing not just from Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations at Uraniborg but from meticulous attempts to adjust Walther\u2019s data for atmospheric refraction and stellar precession.

While Copernicus and Tycho occupy the image\u2019s center, lurking just behind Copernicus\u2019s head is a book labeled \u201cObservations of Regiomontanus and Walther.\u201d Predicting Transits of Mercury For today\u2019s Mercury transit, the key significance of the Rudolphine Tables is that they led Kepler to predict a Mercury transit would occur on 7 November 1631. Other transit observations had been claimed in the past \u2013 including once by Kepler in 1607 \u2013 but were almost certainly sunspots instead. In this case, astronomers had time to prepare, and Pierre Gassendi spotted the planet as predicted during a break in cloudy weather. Gassendi\u2019s observation was a striking confirmation of how astronomical theory was becoming precise enough to predict even a small and brief event far in advance. By the time Johannes Hevelius documented another Mercury transit three decades later, he could compare six sets of astronomical tables and note that two including Kepler\u2019s had successfully predicted the event. This revolution in accuracy was possible not from a single idea or individual but because a growing professional community, stretching across countries and generations, could compare, improve, and compete for observations whose quantity and precision would have been unimaginable when Walther and Pirckheimer looked out a Nuremberg window.

Photograph: Karl Galle/Linda Hall Library, Kansas City    The other remarkable finding to come out of Gassendi\u2019s Mercury transit observation was the planet\u2019s shockingly small apparent size. He and other contemporaries grappled over why it was so much smaller than anyone expected before gradually coming to terms with its implications for cosmic dimensions.  Echoes of this recognition are part of what preserves the wonder of a Mercury transit even now when we can browse close-up images of the planet from orbiting spacecraft. No longer merely a point of light that\u2019s difficult to spot near the horizon, we now know this tiny dot crossing the solar disc is an entire rocky world, orbiting the center of the solar system like us \u2013 and like us just a speck in the vast cosmic ocean.  This piece was edited on 11 May 2016 as the image of Pirckheimer\u2019s observation was mistakenly captioned as a \u2018transit\u2019 rather than an \u2018observation\u2019 of Mercury.",
