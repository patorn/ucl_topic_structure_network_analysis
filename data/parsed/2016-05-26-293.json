I have no idea when or how I will get away from this prison.\u201d    Related: Jon Walter\u2019s top 10 refugee heroes in children\u2019s fiction    These are words from a 12-year-old British girl in an entry for BBC Radio 2\u2019s 500 Words competition, just one of many stories that featured refugees and has led to Oxford University Press declaring \u201crefugee\u201d to be Children\u2019s Word of the Year based on their analysis of just under 123,500 short stories that entered the Radio 2 competition.  The participants, all aged 13 or under, wrote about refugees in sympathetic, emotive terms. They told the stories of children their own age fleeing war (mainly in Syria), undertaking the journey across the Mediterranean sea alone and finally arriving at refugee camps. People smugglers and not being accepted into other countries were further difficulties children described in their refugee stories.    Related: Tales from a diverse universe by Shaun Tan \u2013 gallery    The vocabulary they used included the words boat, camp, dinghy, crisis, border, shelter, journey, sea, desperate, safe, flee, travel, and trek. Understandably grim stuff.  Some of the stories, such as The Girl That Smiled, written by a 10- year-old girl, ended with hope: \u201cNow for the first time in long while she smiled at school and so did Jem then side by side they walked back into the classroom.\u201d  And others, such as I Remember The Feeling gave cosmic dimensions to the refugee crisis through sci-fi stories set in the future: \u201cWe run a sanctuary, a place of rest for around 600 earth refugees. We take in survivors of the apocalypse and protect them.... Recently, we built a large ship to fly us into space, away from destruction and Earth, our destination, Ledidius. It will take 19 years and 25 days to get there.\u201d    Related: Hashtag named UK children's word of the year #important    Other words that were popular with children entering the competition this year were space traveller Tim Peake, Star Wars, Shakespeare, and social media. Using specialised software for the first time in the competition, all the entries were analysed by an academic and technology team from Oxford University. Each word was scrutinised in relation to the words around it, enabling the experts to determine how positive or negative it was. The \u201chappiest\u201d words used were adventure, heart, chocolate, and, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, school and teacher. The \u201cscariest\u201d words were monster, dragon, fire, house, and door. The linguists also considered the top positive and negative words from different parts of the UK. In England top positive words were school and adventure, in Scotland teacher and school, and in Wales they were friends and light. Top negative word in England was day, door in Scotland, and dragon in Wales. In Northern Ireland top negative words were fire and time. The winner of 500 WORDS will be announced on Friday 27 May on Chris Evans\u2019s Breakfast Show.",
