This week\u2019s question:  Working at home, I spend hours at my computer and suffer RSI in my arm. There seem to be plenty of alternative mice out there \u2013 there\u2019s even an optical pen version for \u00a3150. I\u2019d pay it if I thought it would cure it \u2013 anyone else found a low-cost solution? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.",
