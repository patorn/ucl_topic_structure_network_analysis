They voiced concern that the new life chances strategy due to be published later this year would place much less emphasis on low family income as a measure of deprivation \u2013 looking instead at less easily defined factors including educational attainment, family breakdown, addiction and debt. Anti-poverty charities welcomed the government\u2019s commitment to an \u201call-out assault on the root causes of poverty\u201d, but warned that the recent dismantling of the Child Poverty Act \u2013 which had been passed with cross-party support weeks before the 2010 general election \u2013 as part of the Welfare Reform and Work Act earlier this year scrapped targets for the eradication of child poverty.    Related: David Cameron places social reform at centre of Queen's speech    The revised legislation introduced new poverty indicators, including educational attainment and worklessness. But charities stressed that the most direct cause of poverty is having a low income \u2013 often from being in a badly-paid job as opposed to being unemployed \u2013 rather than being linked to family instability or addiction. Matthew Reed, the chief executive of the Children\u2019s Society, said the rhetoric around life chances would mean little without a drive to address child poverty, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies predicts will rise by 50% to 3.6 million children living in relative poverty by 2020. \u201cReducing the number of families struggling with debt and surviving on low incomes must be at the centre of any new strategy. The best way of improving children\u2019s chances of having a decent start in life is to make sure they are not growing up in cold homes or without hot meals,\u201d he said. A more powerful strategy to improve the life chances of the most disadvantaged children would involve scrapping the four-year freeze on children\u2019s benefits and cuts to support for working families in universal credit, he added. The Children\u2019s Society would \u201ccontinue to make the case that low incomes needs to be at the very heart of a life chances strategy for children\u201d. The Queen\u2019s speech on Wednesday announced that: \u201cTo tackle poverty and the causes of deprivation, including family instability, addiction and debt, my government will introduce new indicators for measuring life chances.\u201d In a background briefing on the policy published after the speech, there was a commitment to publishing a strategy that would \u201cset out our comprehensive plan for transforming the life chances of disadvantaged children and their families and will include a set of life indicators for measuring them\u201d. In a speech on life chances in January, David Cameron had hinted at the range of issues that might be included in a strategy, describing \u201ca single mum on a poverty-stricken estate: someone who suffers from chronic depression, someone who perhaps drinks all day to numb the pain of the sexual abuse she suffered as a child.\u201d  He said: \u201cWhen we know that so many of those in poverty have specific, treatable problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction, poor mental health, we\u2019ve got to offer the right support, including to those in crisis.\u201d Imran Hussain, the Child Poverty Action Group\u2019s director of policy, said: \u201cThere is a disconnect between what the government is doing and saying. You can\u2019t spread life chances when child poverty is expected to rise steeply.\u201d He said there was \u201cvery little evidence about poverty being caused by addictions or family breakdown\u201d. \u201cWe welcome the government\u2019s language around an all-out assault on poverty and improving life chances for children. We think to do that you have to have a wide-ranging approach, but we don\u2019t think the government has got a broad approach at the moment; it is looking to exclude income,\u201d Hussain said.  The chief executive of 4Children, Imelda Redmond, said: \u201cIt is vital that the impact of low income is not forgotten. While the commitment to a higher wage, lower welfare economy is the right goal, the facts remain that of the 2.3 million children living in poverty, almost two-thirds are in working households. Low income can impact on a child\u2019s health, their ability to learn and succeed in life. With those numbers set to rise, any meaningful strategy focused on improving the life chances of our children cannot overlook the scourge of low income.\u201d Anna Feuchtwang, the chief executive of the National Children\u2019s Bureau, said: \u201cDespite the prime minister\u2019s stated commitment to promoting all children\u2019s life chances, we are seeing swingeing cuts to the very services \u2013 like children\u2019s centres \u2013 that can build a strong foundation for children.\u201d",
