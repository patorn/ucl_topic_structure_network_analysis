  "body": "We condemn the suspension of President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil. It is thoroughly wrong that a few parliamentarians trample upon the political will expressed at the ballot box by 54 million Brazilians. The new government has shown its true colours by appointing a non-representative, all-male, cabinet and launching neoliberal policies that will hurt millions of working and poorer people. The interim government has no mandate to implement policies that reverse the social programmes that took 40 million people out of poverty. We join Brazil\u2019s progressive political and social movements, and groups from across global civil society including the trade union movement, in condemning this attempt to overthrow democracy in Brazil.Richard Burgon MP (Labour)Ruth Cadbury MP (Labour)Jim Cunningham MP (Labour)Andrew Gwynne MP (Labour)Kelvin Hopkins MP (Labour)Ian Lavery MP (Labour)Clive Lewis MP (Labour)Rachael Maskell MP (Labour)Angus MacNeil MP (SNP)Grahame Morris MP (Labour)John Nicolson MP (SNP)Liz Saville Roberts MP (Plaid Cymu)Tommy Sheppard MP (SNP)Lord Jeremy Beecham (Labour)Lord Martin John O\u2019Neill (Labour)Jenny Rathbone AM (Welsh Assembly, Labour)Claudia Beamish MSP (Labour)Neil Findlay MSP (Labour)Iain Gray MSP (Labour)Elaine Smith MSP (Labour) \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
