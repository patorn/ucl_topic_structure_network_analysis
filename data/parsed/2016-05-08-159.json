  "body": "A sitar player sends music pulsing through the action. Titania swans down from the sky in chiffon. One pair of lovers is gay. There is a touch of George Formby and a nod to David Bowie. There are matted-hair fairies and a roller-skating eunuch. When Oberon casts his spell on the Fairy Queen, he seems to rape her.   Related: The Globe's Emma Rice: 'If anybody bended gender it was Shakespeare'    In her first production as artistic director of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, Emma Rice has thrown down a glittering gauntlet. The former chief of Kneehigh has also instantly dispelled the anxiety of some admirers \u2013 me among them \u2013 that her background in movement and visual theatre would mean that words got short shrift. Her A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is noticeably well spoken. It is sometimes over-energetic, but it is a glory. And an important one. The Globe is a beacon. It brings new audiences to intricate dramas.    I have never seen the Pyramus and Thisbe playlet made so funny. Or so revealing    There is nothing wispy about Rice\u2019s magic. It is disruptive, unnerving, highly comic. It cracks the surface of normality and lets hallucination and truth escape hand in hand. Dirty fairies dance around their Queen\u2019s flowery bed as if they had pushed their way up through the soil. Performance artist Meow Meow makes Titania a vision of sylvan sexiness \u2013 and provides a high-grade comic turn as, rushing to go to bed with Bottom \u2013 she gets in an extended tangle with her tights. Her Oberon is played by Zubin Varla with a glowering control worthy of The Archers\u2019 Rob. He even delivers \u201cI know a bank\u201d as a threat. Tanika Gupta\u2019s dramaturgy has paid off in unswerving clarity. The lovers, who are not \u201cAthenians\u201d but \u201cHoxton hipsters\u201d, are unusually forceful, with Anjana Vasan an especially funky Hermia. The gender switch, which makes Helena into Helenus, gives an added dimension to Demetrius\u2019s reluctance to admit to his love and an added sweetness to their coming together.     Meow Meow (Titania) and Ewan Wardrop (Bottom), centre, in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Photograph: Tristram Kenton    There is some overdone larkiness from the mechanicals at the beginning, but I have never seen the Pyramus and Thisbe playlet made so funny. Or so revealing. The performers take their bow in a blissfully surreal lineup. Moon is in a spacesuit and helmet holding a balloon. Wall peeps out of a sandwich board made of cereal packets. Lion has pink leggings and a mane made of yellow Marigolds. It is as if they have cobbled together their own version of fairyland. Above the stage, Shakespeare\u2019s words float in red neon: \u201cRock the ground.\u201d It rocks. \u2022 A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe until 11 September",
