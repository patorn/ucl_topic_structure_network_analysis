Moving away from the \u201cGap Yah\u201d cliche (epitomised by Jack Whitehall\u2019s Fresh Meat character, JP) elite universities such as Harvard are encouraging students to take gap years so they can build up their CV and work experience. \u201cTaking a year out can set you apart from a crowd of other applicants,\u201d says Katie Bateman, a careers adviser at the University of Gloucestershire. \u201cGraduates can learn another language and prove just how adaptable they are by embracing change and learning to adjust to a different culture.\u201d Whether you use the time to learn a language, experience a new culture or get to grips with a new skill, an Erasmus Impact study shows employers value international experience.  So what\u2019s the best way to make the most of your year out? Is it better to volunteer abroad, or work closer to home and build experience that reflects your career goals?
