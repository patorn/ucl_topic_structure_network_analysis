  "body": "Kevin Lane is wearing a blue Italian suit. His white shirt is ironed, his shoes polished and his handshake firm. At this smart London restaurant, he\u00a0seems out of place among the businessmen and women \u2013 but only because he has the physique of a bodybuilder, and a deep\u00a0voice that draws attention when\u00a0he raises it. Which he does, very occasionally, when he\u2019s animated \u2013 as he is now, talking about his new businesses and\u00a0how he has just bought a new Mercedes. He\u2019s doing OK. But there\u2019s something nagging at him, and when he is upset, his voice drops. Days earlier, Lane was pictured in a newspaper outside a nightclub with the former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona. A\u00a0source quoted by the Daily Mail said\u00a0the pair were \u201call over each other\u201d, and there was talk of them dating. The story, he says, is nonsense. He had been introduced to Katona, and they had gone for a night out with friends: \u201cThe rest of it is just not true.\u201d But it is the headline that troubles him most. \u201cKerry Katona pictured kissing convicted murderer.\u201d Lane walked out of Blantyre House in Kent on a sunny Friday in January last year. He had mixed feelings as he was driven away from the category D jail. There was relief that his ordeal had come to an end, but also a sense of guilt for the friends he was leaving behind. Underlying it all, there was an anger that won\u2019t\u00a0go away. Twenty years ago, Lane was jailed for shooting a man called Robert Magill.\u00a0After he was sent down at the Old Bailey, he says he was the victim of\u00a0a smear campaign with newspapers nicknaming him \u201cthe Executioner\u201d, and suggesting he was likely to have been responsible for a number of unsolved murders, including that\u00a0of the Great Train Robber, Charlie Wilson in 1990. These crimes would certainly have\u00a0made Lane, now 48, one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous and prolific\u00a0criminals. But Lane says the accusations are all untrue. During the years he was inside, from every bare cell or isolation unit they placed him in, he has raged against his conviction, trying to channel his energy into his case. Now that he is free, the\u00a0effort continues.     How the Guardian reported the story in 2001. Photograph: The Guardian    Document by secret document, prised from the police in a campaign that has involved writing 10,000\u00a0letters, he has pieced together the jigsaw he thinks shows he was framed \u2013 and he believes he can show by whom. He\u00a0knows there are people who\u00a0want him to shut up, to move on, but\u00a0he won\u2019t. \u201cI might be rebuilding my life, but that\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean I have forgotten. It doesn\u2019t mean I will let it go. I\u00a0won\u2019t stop. The\u00a0people who did this to me have\u00a0to\u00a0know that: I\u00a0won\u2019t stop. Not\u00a0until I have cleared my name.\u201d I first met Lane more than 15 years ago, when I wrote about his case. The Guardian was the first to investigate his conviction, but getting to him was not easy. Lane was in HMP Frankland, a high-security prison in County Durham. He was regarded as an \u201cexceptional-risk\u201d prisoner \u2013 and the authorities clearly regarded me as exceptionally foolish for wanting to speak to such a supposedly dangerous man. Three prison officers stood within touching distance of us inside a cramped, windowless room. We sat on low chairs at a low table that was bolted to the floor. Two more guards stood outside. I wasn\u2019t allowed a pencil\u00a0or pen. It was in here, with this\u00a0overbearing audience, that Lane\u00a0attempted to explain why he had been wrongly convicted for the murder. Magill, a car dealer by day and\u00a0hardman by night, had been gunned down near his home in Hertfordshire, as he walked his dog, on\u00a013 October 1994. Five bullets hit Magill, including two\u00a0to the head, at very close range, from a sawn-off shotgun. The murder was described by the judge at Lane\u2019s trial as \u201cdesperately violent, shocking, horrifying\u201d. But proof of Lane\u2019s involvement appeared flimsy. The first trial collapsed when the jury could not reach a verdict. In the second, the police alleged the murder was a contract killing \u2013 and that Lane was hired for up to \u00a3100,000. But there was\u00a0no evidence for this. Witnesses to the murder didn\u2019t pick him out at an identity parade. His name wasn\u2019t mentioned by two police informers who rang detectives offering to name\u00a0the killers. Instead, they named\u00a0two other known criminals \u2013 Roger Vincent and David Smith.     The victim \u2026 Robert Magill, who was shot dead as he walked his dog in a Hertfordshire beauty spot. Photograph: PA/EMPICS Sports Photo Agency    Lane\u2019s conviction rested on a palmprint found on a binliner in the boot of the killer\u2019s BMW getaway car. Lane has never denied driving the car\u00a0\u2013\u00a0he says it was lent to him by an acquaintance after his own car had been stolen, and that he returned it four days before the murder. He cannot explain how the palmprint came to be on the binliner, but if he had killed Magill, and if he were the professional hitman prosecutors alleged, he was pretty careless covering his tracks. Lane said he borrowed the car to take his sons to see his mother, and detectives found the children\u2019s fingerprints all over the dashboard. Lane\u2019s contention that he was \u201cfitted up\u201d took on a different complexion two\u00a0years after our first meeting. The\u00a0detective who led the Magill murder inquiry for Hertfordshire police, Detective-Inspector Chris Spackman, was himself jailed. Spackman, it turned out, was deeply corrupt. When he was sentenced to\u00a0four years in July 2003 for conspiracy to steal, the court heard he was responsible for \u201ca disgraceful catalogue of crime and lies\u201d \u2013 which involved plotting to steal \u00a3160,000 from his own force, and siphoning off money for himself. To Lane\u2019s lawyers, the fact that\u00a0Spackman had a history of manipulating evidence seemed reason enough to question whether his conviction was safe. But as the exhibits officer in the case, Spackman also had control of all\u00a0the evidence, including Lane\u2019s fingerprints, and the binliner on\u00a0which\u00a0his palmprint was found. Vitally, there were also 20 tipoffs naming Roger Vincent as the murderer. Vincent was arrested and charged, but the case collapsed. But before that happened, he had had a series of highly unorthodox \u201cconfidential chats\u201d with Spackman, which were not disclosed at Lane\u2019s trial. What was said is still a mystery. Spackman has denied any impropriety and Vincent and Smith have denied the\u00a0Magill shooting. In 2005, Vincent was convicted of another shooting described in court as a \u201cthoroughly planned, ruthless and brutally executed assassination\u201d. Smith was convicted alongside him as his getaway driver. That was similar, then, in many ways to the murder of Magill. Could Vincent have been responsible for both? Armed with this new information, Lane urged the court of appeal to look at his case again. It took him 10\u00a0years to\u00a0get a hearing in court. \u201cI knew I was going to be arrested over\u00a0Magill because someone called me\u00a0to warn me. I was told: \u2018There may be a problem with the car \u2026 you will probably get a tug. It\u2019s got nothing to do with you and will blow over. Keep your mouth shut and sit tight.\u2019 I knew something was wrong. I\u00a0remember telling Kim (his ex-partner): \u2018This doesn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019m\u00a0being set up.\u2019\u201d In July last year, 19 years after his conviction, Lane\u2019s lawyers had their day in court. They contended Lane had been\u00a0framed by a corrupt detective with links to significant figures in the\u00a0criminal underworld who had concocted the evidence. Two other people have had convictions overturned because of concerns about Spackman \u2013 Lane expected to be the\u00a0third. But, to his astonishment, the\u00a0court dismissed the application, saying\u00a0it was \u201cnot persuaded that the safety of the conviction is\u00a0in\u00a0doubt\u201d. So, for now, Lane remains a murderer. The conviction led to the breakup of his marriage; his sons, Tommy and Aaron, grew up without him. Since his release, Lane has been in a hurry. He has had periods of partying too hard. But he has also caught up with a world that has changed dramatically since he went into prison. He\u00a0has settled down with a new partner, but is taking time to adjust. He\u00a0has his own flat and prefers to live alone. Being in a single cell, he got used to doing things his way, and he finds it hard to live with other people. He\u2019s meticulously, obsessively clean. He gets up most days at 5am, goes to the gym, and then hits the phone, trying to broker deals for his property and construction businesses. He takes the murder conviction into every meeting, and every social occasion. \u201cI\u00a0always try to bring it up first. I\u2019d rather it\u00a0came from me, rather than them finding out from someone else or on Google. Most people are very\u00a0good about it. They want to hear about the case and my life.\u201d     Crime scene \u2026 the cordoned-off woodland area of Rickmansworth where Magill was shot. Photograph: John Stillwell/PA Archive/PA Photos    Lane has served time with some of\u00a0the underworld\u2019s most feared characters; from Irish terrorists to Brink\u2019s-Mat launderer, Kenneth Noye. He regards Kenny Collins, one of the Hatton Garden gang,\u00a0as a friend. \u201cI met Kenny when I was first on remand at Belmarsh. He\u2019s a good man and he was good to me. You don\u2019t forget things like that. He\u2019s\u00a0one of the last of the old-school criminals. It may sound strange to say, but there\u2019s an honour in the way they behave, a code. You don\u2019t get that now. Crime is changing, and\u00a0the prisons are changing, too. Now,\u00a0the\u00a0gangs that exist outside prison are re-forming in jail, and they\u00a0bring their violence with them. The\u00a0Yardie gangs, the terrorists. Prison\u00a0is a more dangerous and volatile\u00a0place than it was when I\u00a0first\u00a0went in. I know prisoners who\u00a0converted to Islam to get the protection of the Muslim gangs.\u201d Lane didn\u2019t have to join a gang; he has respect in the anarchic hinterlands of organised crime, a respect earned in a manner he now regrets. At school in Harefield, Middlesex, found himself defending his older brother, Sean, who was getting teased by friends because of a head brace he had to wear after a serious accident. Lane, it turned out, could throw a punch. Several of them, in fact, at high speed. It is a gift that has\u00a0got him into trouble \u2013 and out of it \u2013 throughout his life. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I\u2019d fight older kids and, when I was a teenager, I\u2019d fight grown men. No guns or knives, just fists. It made me feel special, invincible. It\u2019s\u00a0hard to describe. Looking back now I can see people used me for their own ends. \u2018Get Kevin, he\u2019ll sort it out,\u2019 that sort of thing. I was immature and naive.\u00a0I did things that I regret and there are people I would like to apologise to. In time.\u201d Twenty years in jail enhanced rather\u00a0than diminished this reputation. \u201cThere is a lot of bullying and intimidation. I hated to see it going on. I didn\u2019t care who it was, or how big they were. It\u2019s a strange thing, but the only fear I\u00a0have ever felt is the fear of losing. The\u00a0embarrassment of it.\u201d Prison officers, he says, would often turn a blind eye, to let inmates sort out problems on their own, in their own way. Fights would take place in gyms, in laundry rooms, under prison rules. Lane says he left the prison system unbeaten \u2013 physically and mentally. It\u2019s\u00a0a record he intends to keep.",
