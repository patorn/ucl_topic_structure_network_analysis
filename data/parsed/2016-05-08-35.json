  "body": "The Australian federal police should withhold information from foreign enforcement agencies if sharing it may lead to a person being subject to the death penalty, a parliamentary inquiry has said.    Related: A year after the Bali Nine executions, Indonesia prepares firing squads again    The inquiry\u2019s final report, released in the same week as the anniversary of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan\u2019s execution by an Indonesian firing squad, heard from a number of experts who said there was nothing in current Australian law to prevent a repeat of the circumstances which led to their deaths. The report, by the joint standing committee of foreign affairs, defence and trade, and the human rights subcommittee, examined Australia\u2019s current engagement to end the death penalty, and how it could advocate further, at the request of the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop. \u201cAustralia has long supported abolition, and is an active advocate on the world stage,\u201d said the chair of the subcommittee, Philip Ruddock. \u201cAs a nation, we can be proud of our advocacy and our support for the United Nations\u2019 work on abolition. But Australia can do more.\u201d Among the recommendations was a call for the AFP to alter its guidelines on \u201cinternational police-to-police assistance in death penalty situations\u201d.  The AFP, it said, should make its primary aim the prevention of exposure of persons to arrest or charge in countries which may apply the death penalty for those crimes. This aim should apply to all people, not just Australians, it said. Should a foreign law enforcement body request information about a case, the AFP should first seek assurances that the death penalty will not be sought. Where the matter relates to drug crimes, including trafficking, the AFP should obtain a guarantee before providing any information. \u201cIn situations where such guarantees cannot be obtained, the AFP should withhold provision of information that may be relevant to the cases concerned,\u201d it said. The release of the bipartisan report (pdf) comes one year after the Australian citizens, Chan and Sukumaran, were executed in Indonesia for their part in a drug-smuggling ring, known as the Bali Nine. Their deaths in 2015 contributed to the highest recorded number of executions worldwide since 1989.    Related: Memories of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran can help us fight the death penalty | Brigid Delaney    The responsibility of the AFP and its actions in sharing information with their Indonesian counterparts, leading to the group\u2019s arrest in Bali, has long been a contentious point within the case. The AFP has always defended its actions. In 2006 the federal court found its actions to be lawful, but recommended a review of procedure. \u201cA number of witnesses to the inquiry raised the issue of the AFP\u2019s cooperation with international law enforcement, concerned that Australia\u2019s efforts to protect its citizens from exposure to the death penalty could be undermined by the sharing of information in possible death penalty cases,\u201d the report said. The Human Rights Law Centre told the inquiry it was \u201cforeseeable\u201d that the information sharing would lead to the individuals facing execution. \u201cIt was also open to the AFP to arrest the Bali Nine in Australia and ensure that they were tried in Australian courts that would not impose the death penalty. Yet there is nothing to prevent AFP from doing the same thing again,\u201d it said. The Australian Lawyers for Human Rights said if not for inconsistencies in safeguards around cross-agency assistance, \u201cAndrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran may not have been exposed to a sentence of death\u201d.  \u201cThere are currently no Australian laws that prevent a repeat of the circumstances that saw the Bali Nine sentenced to death and executed,\u201d it said. Emily Howie, from the Human Rights Law Centre, also noted an inconsistency between the AFP\u2019s information-sharing guidelines and extradition legislation. \u201c[Our] Extradition Act protects against surrendering people to the death penalty and the Mutual Assistance Act protects against assisting other countries if the death penalty may be imposed, whereas the AFP Act contains no such safeguards,\u201d she said. The AFP is currently reviewing its national guidelines. Data provided by the AFP showed that in the five years to 2014 it approved 411 of 446 requests to share information in potential death penalty matters. The report also recommended a \u201cwhole-of-government strategy\u201d to advocate for abolition around the world, with a particular focus on the Indo-Pacific region and the US.   Related: Indonesia is preparing to execute prisoners, police official confirms    \u201cWere the United States to move towards abolition this would most likely have a significant catalytic effect on other retentionist nations,\u201d it said. The committee expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d that executions increased in 2015, although its pushes for moratoriums had gained ground and a larger proportion of executions were by a small group of countries. International law did not comprehensively outlaw the death penalty, and its application was \u201cfragmented\u201d. While Australia has legislation preventing extradition of a person to a country where they face the death penalty, a caveat that it may go ahead if the country assures it will not carry out the death penalty was largely unenforceable.",
