  "body": "Eddie Jones has warned his Australian compatriots they are in for an \u201cenormous scrap\u201d when England play three Tests against the Wallabies next month. He also says he will be disappointed if his squad do not make an impact in the series, suggesting it will be a \u201cfailure\u201d if they return empty-handed. No one knows better than Jones what awaits the touring team but he expects to win the series, which starts in Brisbane on 11 June. He said: \u201cIt would be a failure if we don\u2019t win the series. We want to be the top team in the world and I don\u2019t think we should have any embarrassment about saying that. Therefore, if we go to Australia, we should expect to win the series.\u201d According to Jones the first prerequisite is to ensure Australia know they are in a battle from the outset. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure they feel like playing against England is a different experience,\u201d stressed Jones, who coached the Wallabies against England in the 2003 World Cup final in Sydney. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be an enormous scrap. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to go into the games. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in their face, physical, unrelenting, don\u2019t give them a moment. Saracens are a great example of what you can do when you\u2019ve got that sort of attitude. They\u2019re clearly the best side in Europe and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to be like. We won\u2019t play exactly like Saracens but we\u2019ve got to have the same attitude.\u201d Jones has stacked his squad with players he believes can satisfy that mission statement and stand firm on and off the field. \u201cWhen you go to Australia everything there is coordinated,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe media work with the team to provide a hostile environment for the team arriving ... it\u2019s one of those unique situations only Australia can get away with. It\u2019s a good test for us. Historically we\u2019ve only ever won three Tests in Australia, so there\u2019s a great opportunity to use all those hostile ingredients to provide a platform for us to perform well.\u201d Despite England\u2019s recent Six Nations grand slam Jones is wary of an Australia side who reached last autumn\u2019s World Cup final under his old Randwick team-mate Michael Cheika. \u201cThey\u2019re just much better with the ball. If you look at the stats from the World Cup, that\u2019s the difference between the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere teams. So they\u2019re going to put more questions to our defence than teams did in the Six Nations and try and play with an intensity and pace that isn\u2019t common in the northern hemisphere.\u201d Jones is also not fooled by the poor results of the Australian provinces in Super Rugby after a string of defeats by New Zealand teams. \u201cI don\u2019t look at the form of Super Rugby,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for players to play Test rugby, it\u2019s not how they\u2019re playing for their club or province. It\u2019s their capability to transfer it to a higher level of the game. \u201cIf you just look through their squads, they\u2019re not playing well but within that there\u2019s a very talented and proud group of players that will be a different group once they assemble.\u201d Having spent his formative years in Australia he is also braced for whatever insults are lobbed his way once the team arrive in Brisbane next week. \u201cGoing to Australia you\u2019re going to get various comments but you get them everywhere you go in the world. I coached in Japan and I wasn\u2019t Japanese and the Japanese didn\u2019t like me. I coach in England and probably the English don\u2019t like me. You\u2019re going to be unliked wherever you go if you\u2019re not that country\u2019s person. You just get on with it. The joy is in coaching the team.\u201d",
