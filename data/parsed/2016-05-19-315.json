  "body": "The gimmick in Lose Weight for Love (BBC1) is that the overweight couples who put themselves up for an exercise, diet and psychological overhaul by Professor Tanya Byron and her team must separate for 10 weeks. This is so they break bad habits developed together and are treated for whatever different underlying causes leads each to overeat. Well. OK. Let us not dwell on a conceit the spuriousness of which can be amply demonstrated by the fact that its exact opposite would sound equally convincing (\u201cThe couple that is treated together stays thinner and fitter together!\u201d). Onward. IT worker Phil has, as physiologist Rick Shakes-Braithwaite points out, managed to bypass the gastric bypass he had a few years ago. My instinct to applaud probably goes some way to explaining my own increasingly adiposal constitution. But now his heart is too overstrained for Rick even to put him on an exercise programme beyond walking. His partner Becky is 17st and an asthmatic smoker. Rick gets her interval training and then running. Tanya tackles Becky\u2019s lack of self-belief, a legacy of her years in care as a child when her mother died. There is little point, thinks Becky, to asserting your power to change things: \u201cYou don\u2019t always get what you want.\u201d My own heart just about buckled. Her sister Danika is made of sterner stuff, and the two of them together are wonderful. Tanya tries to tackle Becky\u2019s mindset first. \u201cWho has made this be a success?\u201d she asks after Becky loses her first stone. \u201cI just followed the rules,\u201d says Becky, stoically, refusing to take credit or admit she has done well. This is, I\u2019m sure, partly because of her childhood insecurities but to anyone with personal experience of the phenomenon it is clearly at least equally due to the fact that Becky is northern. It is a regional psychopathology that baffles the profoundly southern prof and doubles her workload. Then it\u2019s Danika\u2019s turn. Tanya suggests Danika could try talking Becky down from her anxiety, rather than confronting it. Danika looks sceptical but willing. It\u2019s the best you can hope for beyond Watford Gap. The counselling works a treat. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right,\u201d says Danika as Becky nearly throws up with nerves before her half-marathon. \u201cStop panicking. She\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she says confidently to the camera as Becky starts off shakily. \u201cHopefully.\u201d Phil, meanwhile, is up to 10,000 steps a day and has drawn up a colour-coded spreadsheet of what he can and can\u2019t eat and when. He calls it the bible. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t need \u2018psychologising\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bible says: \u2018Eat this.\u2019 It\u2019s sussed.\u201d Phil, too, is northern and Phil is quite right. Tanya has another half-hearted stab at challenging his all-or-nothing mindset by, uh, gathering his family round him to ask him not to relapse, but we all know it\u2019s the spreadsheet that\u2019s going to do it. When Becky crosses the finish line, Danika tells her she\u2019s proud of her. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d she asks as Becky remains silent. \u201cI\u2019m just wishing I didn\u2019t find it uncomfortable saying I\u2019ve done summat good or someone says I\u2019ve done summat good.\u201d There is a pause. \u201cYou\u2019re hard work, you are!\u201d says Danika. \u201cI am hard work,\u201d agrees Becky with a grin. There are times when psychologising helps and there are times when only sisters \u2013 or spreadsheets \u2013 will do. Handmade on the Silk Road (BBC4) came to the end of its three-episode run last night. Having watched weavers and woodcarvers at their work, it was the turn of the potters in the desert city of Meybod in the Yazd province of Iran, which has been producing ceramics since the eighth century BC. Abdol Reza Aghaei has been a potter, like at least three generations of his family before him, for 40 years. \u201cWhen we were children,\u201d he remembers as he pounds and kneads the lump of clay he has dug out of the earth, \u201cwe used to do this with our hands and feet.\u201d He throws it on to a wheel and, hypnotically, beautifully, impossibly, a water jug emerges, to be painted, glazed, fired and \u2013 if he can find someone who does not prefer the cheaper imports that are flooding his market \u2013 sold. It has been a lovely series, full of the inexpressible pleasure of watching craftsmen and women, repositories of ancient skills, at work and filmed with an appreciative eye without falling into the trap of fetishising primitivism. Could we journey a little further, with a return series, perhaps? It\u2019s an all-round restorative for the soul.",
