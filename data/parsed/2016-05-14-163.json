  "body": "I am writing from America this week, staying here for a few days for work.\u00a0I\u00a0have what a therapist would call a\u00a0\u201ccomplicated relationship\u201d with\u00a0this country. For a long time, America was like that first boyfriend I always assumed I\u2019d one\u00a0day get back with and marry \u2013 only to turn up\u00a0at my 20th school reunion and realise that he\u2019s a lot fatter and a bit more racist than I\u00a0remembered. I was born in New York and moved to London when I was 11, because of my father\u2019s job. For many years, I saw my life as a train that had come off the correct track and ended up derailed in this strange European country, where people were obsessed with Australian soap operas and novelty singles by superstars such as Mr Blobby. This, I\u00a0was certain, was not where I was meant to be and, boy, did I let my blameless parents know exactly how much they\u2019d ruined my life by forcing me to leave my home, my friends and my norfolk terrier back in Manhattan (truthfully, I was mainly upset about the dog). It didn\u2019t help that, soon after we moved, I got very sick and had to spend the next three years in hospital, so Britain came to represent hospital life, while America was the place where I could go outside without the supervision of a\u00a0nurse. Things like that matter to a teenager. I always assumed I\u2019d move back to America and, when I finally had the independence and money to do so, I did. It was at that point that I\u00a0finally realised it wasn\u2019t America I was trying to get back to \u2013 it was my childhood, before I was sick. Unfortunately, I came to this realisation about 24 hours after I signed over three months\u2019 rent for an overpriced Manhattan apartment. So\u00a0I\u00a0made the move anyway and turned back the\u00a0clock the one way I could: I got another norfolk terrier. People say that when you move as a kid you spread your roots, and that\u2019s true. But while your roots grow wider, they\u2019re not very deep \u2013 and wherever you live, you\u2019re always comparing the present with your other parallel life. There\u2019s so much I love about America \u2013 prefer, even, to Britain. Most importantly, the candy, Twizzlers especially, which knock your British liquorice into a cocked hat. (Before any Brits start screaming at me about Cadbury\u2019s, wait until you hear about my sister, who used to insist American toilet paper was better and for years personally imported White Cloud across the Atlantic. How about that for an insult, Britain?) But when a liberal American hears British people complain about the Tories, we nod sympathetically, but inside we\u2019re thinking, \u201cKitten, please, you have no idea.\u201d Sure, the Tories are ridiculous, with their toby jug faces and the fact that they all went to one school that\u00a0makes Hogwarts sound basic. Yet, unlike\u00a0the\u00a0Republicans, they don\u2019t sound genuinely deranged. The day after I arrived in\u00a0America for this trip, Donald Trump was on TV\u00a0referring fondly to neo-Nazis as \u201cmy fans\u201d and\u00a0refusing to\u00a0criticise them for sending antisemitic threats to a Jewish journalist. Several\u00a0prominent Republicans promptly endorsed him. I wouldn\u2019t say all this puts Ken Livingstone\u2019s Hitler obsession and Zac Goldsmith\u2019s idiotic mayoral campaign into perspective, but I would say that it makes British politicians, when it comes to embracing open racism, look like rank amateurs. It\u2019s funny being back in the States during the\u00a0election because it was partly as a result of the\u00a0last election that I moved back to London in 2012. To use a satisfying English phrase, the\u00a0whole thing did my head in. Not the Republican candidates, such as Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann, both of whom seemed closer to demented robots than anything approaching human, but the people who voted for them. Sure, Britain has Ukip and Britain First, but they\u2019re not one of the two major political parties. The place I assumed would feel so familiar felt in many ways more foreign than Timbuktu. I ran back to Britain, and this time I\u00a0brought the dog. Four years on, I have a different relationship with America. I no longer view it as the one that got away, or the one that betrayed me by not being what I wanted. At the age of 37, I\u2019ve finally grown out of those childish expectations and teenage tantrums, and I\u2019ve learned not to look for something on the outside to explain myself to me. Now it\u2019s just this place I can always come back to, one that feels very familiar but fallible. It\u2019s also where I feel most myself, because it\u2019s where I still remember my best self. I guess it\u2019s what you\u2019d call home.",
