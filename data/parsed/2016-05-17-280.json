  "body": "New polling shows 48% of Australians, including 43% of Labor voters, oppose the idea of bringing asylum seekers from Manus Island to Australia even though Papua New Guinea\u2019s supreme court has found the centre illegal. The finding, in the latest Essential Report, underlines Bill Shorten\u2019s challenge as he faces Labor candidates concerned about the humanitarian impact of the near-identical policies of the major parties on asylum seekers and a prime minister repeatedly claiming the concerns would lead to a Labor government restarting the people-smuggling trade. The Essential poll found the election race is tight, with Labor leading by 51% to 49% after 10 days of campaigning in which Shorten\u2019s intended messages about education and manufacturing jobs have been repeatedly overshadowed by the Coalition\u2019s attacks on asylum. It found 62% of Coalition voters opposed bringing asylum seekers to Australia from PNG.   Related: Campaign catchup: PM targets Labor over asylum    On Tuesday, Shorten addressed Turnbull\u2019s attack before the prime minister had even delivered it, and without being prompted by a media question \u2013 insisting it was a \u201clie\u201d. \u201cBefore I take questions, I just want to make some comments about Mr Turnbull and some of the dishonest things he\u2019s been saying about Labor,\u201d Shorten said.  \u201cHe has clearly decided that he\u2019s going to say as often as he can that Labor won\u2019t tackle the people smugglers and he\u2019s also clearly decided to say as often as he can that in the event of a hung parliament Labor would form a coalition with the Greens. There is no truth to any aspect or any detail of what he\u2019s saying. Mr Turnbull\u2019s clearly been told lies or he\u2019s telling lies. Whatever the case, he ought to stop and he ought to stop now.\u201d But in Darwin, touring a border force vessel, Turnbull intensified his attack, saying Labor was \u201criddled with dissent\u201d and could not be trusted on the issue. \u201cMy government is utterly committed, totally committed, to ensuring that the people smugglers\u2019 trade is stopped as it has been,\u201d he said. \u201cMr Shorten says that he agrees with the government\u2019s policy, that\u2019s what he says. We have now more than two dozen \u2013 25 at latest count \u2013 of his candidates and backbenchers who are unhappy, disassociate themselves with, qualify their support for, our policy and the reality is that they are just the tip of the iceberg. \u201cThey are the symptom of a fundamental problem that Mr Shorten has, which is that the Labor party does not agree with the government\u2019s strong policy on border protection. They do not agree with turning the boats back and, regardless of what they say before the election, we know from the experience of Kevin Rudd\u2019s government that they will ... fail, that they lack the conviction to be strong, to be strong in Australia\u2019s interests.\u201d Turnbull pointed to comments from the deputy Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, on Monday in which she said: \u201cAll of these candidates have said that they support Labor party policy. What they don\u2019t like is Liberal party policy. They don\u2019t like indefinite detention on Manus Island and Nauru. Labor is committed to stopping the boats, to making sure that people smugglers don\u2019t start up again their wicked trade. They don\u2019t care whether people make it to Australia or not. What Labor candidates don\u2019t want to see is the indefinite detention on Manus Island.\u201d Turnbull said: \u201cShe\u2019s said that she and those other candidates support Labor\u2019s border protection policy, which is different from the government\u2019s policy. Well, how is it different?

You cannot trust them on border protection.\u201d The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, accused Labor candidates of \u201cmessaging\u201d on social media to people in detention centres to indicate a change of policy if there was a change in government. Labor\u2019s policy \u2013 reached after a bitter fight at last year\u2019s national conference \u2013 mirrors the Coalition\u2019s support for offshore detention for all asylum seekers coming to Australia and the turnback of boats intercepted on the way. Labor says its policy differs in that it wants independent oversight of the camps, a children\u2019s advocate for unaccompanied minors and faster processing times and, it has promised to increase the humanitarian intake from 13,750 to 27,000 by 2025. Neither major party has said where it would resettle the refugees from Nauru or Manus Island. Turnbull is including Plibersek in the 25 MPs and candidates who are dissenting from Labor\u2019s policy. He is also including several MPs who backed the \u201cLet Them Stay\u201d campaign, which was specifically trying to prevent 267 people, including babies, from being returned to Nauru. The government let several of the families stay in Australia. Other Labor MPs on the list have expressed more serious reservations about Labor\u2019s policy.",
