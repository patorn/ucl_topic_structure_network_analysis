  "body": "Harry Redknapp got off to a shaky start in his latest position as Central Coast Mariners\u2019 \u201cfootball consultant\u201d with the experienced English coach getting the name of his new club wrong in a radio interview and indicating he would not be visiting Australia in his new role. The Mariners revealed at the club\u2019s end-of-season awards night last week that the 69-year-old would be taking on a part-time role, with chief executive Mike Charlesworth saying he expected Redknapp to visit Central Coast on \u201cat least two occasions during the season and hopefully more during the off season\u201d.

It\u2019s a long way,\u201d Redknapp said. \u201cThirty-odd hours on a plane. I came home the other week and it took me a week to recover. It\u2019s a long way but it\u2019s a fantastic country when you get there.\u201d Redknapp\u2019s brief at the Mariners is to put the club on the global map by using his connections around the world, but he may well be advised to consult an atlas himself before embarking on his latest football venture on New South Wales\u2019 central coast. When asked the name of his new club, he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the South Coast Mariners. I met the owner, he\u2019s a great guy, an English guy. Peter Storrie\u2019s involved and they\u2019ve got an English coach as well. They asked me if I would do a bit as an advisor.\u201d Redknapp, currently in a mentoring role at Derby County, most recently took up a two-game stint as coach of Jordan\u2019s national side, overseeing an 8-0 win over Bangladesh before taking a 5-1 hammering by the Socceroos in the final game of the most recent phase of World Cup qualifying in the Asian conference.  Redknapp knows Storrie, the Mariners\u2019 executive vice chairman, well \u2013 the pair worked together when Redknapp managed West Ham United and they joined forces again later at Portsmouth. Charlesworth talked up Redknapp\u2019s appointment, saying last week he was one of the biggest signings in the club\u2019s history. \u201cRedknapp is a very well respected EPL [English Premier League] coach and has been for many years with the likes of West Ham, Portsmouth and Spurs,\u201d Charlesworth said. \u201cHe\u2019s a BBC football pundit and one of the greatest football characters in the game today. \u201cIn the interest of assisting our coaches and staff, assisting the Mariners commercially and help to put them on the global map we\u2019ve just made one of our biggest signings and that\u2019s Harry himself joining the Mariners on a part-time basis. \u201cJust like Peter Storrie, Harry will be visiting the Coast on at least two occasions during the season and hopefully more during the off season and I think this great news and another huge step forward in the club\u2019s development.\u201d The Mariners picked up the 2015-16 A-League season\u2019s wooden spoon, finishing 12 points adrift at the bottom of the ladder having picked up just three wins and a total of 13 points from 27 games.",
