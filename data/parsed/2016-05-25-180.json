  "body": "Name: Votin. Age: Brand new. Appearance: Bangin. What, or who, is Votin? It\u2019s many things: movement, state of mind, hashtag. What does it mean, though? Roughly translated, it appears to mean \u201cvote in\u201d. In which case it\u2019s missing an \u201ce\u201d and a space. It just seems that way, because you don\u2019t speak the language of the young people of today. Oh God, is this a young person thing? It\u2019s a new campaign aimed at persuading the yoof to vote to remain in the EU. How does it hope to persuade them? By reminding them of all the great things we get to do as a member of the European Union. Such as? Workin, roamin, chillin, shoppin ... Is your tongue swelling up or something? \u2026 learnin, earnin, mixin, ravin, chattin. All the great things. These are verbs of some kind? These are verbs the young people way \u2013 without a \u201cg\u201d on the end! I would normally stick an apostrophe there, to indicate the missing letter. No time, Grandpa! These words flash by too fast in #Votin\u2019s new advert. Who\u2019s paying for this? Young people don\u2019t have any money. A group called Britain Stronger in Europe, headed by Will Straw. Jack Straw\u2019s son? I guess he would know what the kids are into these days. These days Will Straw is in his mid-30s, with a kid of his own. Time flies. Remember when he got caught selling pot? Yeah. In those days, he certainly knew what young undercover Mirror reporters were into. How\u2019s #Votin goin so far? As with most attempts to curry favour with the young, it appears to have backfired badly. \u201cPatronisin beyond belief,\u201d said one wag on Twitter. But the campaign has claimed they actually wanted people to \u201ctake the piss out of it\u201d \u2013 in order to drum up attention.   Related: Brexit stage left: will anyone make it to the BpopLive stage?    Say what you will about the other side, but you wouldn\u2019t catch those Brexiteers indulging in pathetic tactics like this. Are you not aware of BpopLive, the upcoming Brexit-sponsored pop concert, from which edgy yoof acts including Alesha Dixon and 5ive have pulled out in haste? Talk about backfirin. Exactly. Whereas #Votin is at least about hopin, strivin and aspirin. I could use some aspirin about now. That\u2019s the spirit! Do say: \u201cDon\u2019t forget about all the subsidisin, clear food labellin and cross-border policin.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cVotinnit.\u201d",
