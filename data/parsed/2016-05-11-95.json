  "body": "The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, has urged Britain to go \u201cright to the end\u201d in stamping out tax secrecy it its overseas territories and crown dependencies that continue to act as tax havens for the wealthy. Sapin, speaking to the Guardian before arriving in London for David Cameron\u2019s anti-corruption conference on Thursday, said he felt Britain had \u201cdecided sincerely to end a certain number of situations\u201d characterised by the status of UK overseas territories and dependencies such as the British Virgin Islands.  \u201cOf course we want Britain to go right to the end, and as fast as possible, so all those jurisdictions respect the same rules of transparency,\u201d he said.    Related: David Cameron calls for 'fairness' from critics on tax affairs of territories    He added: \u201cThere are always obstacles, but the principle obstacle is egotism, the feeling that we can get by on our own. \u201cThe particularity of every battle against tax optimisation, tax fraud or international corruption is that no one can fight it alone. International cooperation is fundamental. You can\u2019t fight all alone in a corner, which is what has happened until now, when there was a kind of egotism of each nation which thought that they could deal with it alone in their own corner.\u201d After revelations about offshore financial activities in the Panama Papers that detailed the tax avoidance of the world\u2019s rich and powerful, Cameron last month announced that the overseas territories and crown dependencies \u2013 such as the British Virgin Islands and Jersey \u2013 had agreed to provide UK tax and law enforcement agencies with full access to company ownership details. But campaigners have insisted they must go further and allow public access to registers. The presence of UK overseas territories and crown dependences at the London anti-corruption summit was key, Sapin said. \u201cI understand that they have been invited, I hope they will be there and I clearly hope that everyone takes part with the same momentum.  \u201cEven if there will still be resistance \u2013 even if, for example, Panama, which put in place a veritable industry of opacity and lack of transparency, is still showing strong resistance, I think there is now such a powerful groundswell that is is unstoppable.\u201d  Asked about Britain\u2019s move to clamp down on tax secrecy, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t doubt Britain\u2019s sincerity. But we also know the complexity of the British system, the place of the City, the historic existence of a certain number of entities very close to Britain which, until now, didn\u2019t want to cooperate in a sufficiently active way.      Stakes are high for France at the anti-corruption summit with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande eyeing a second term.

But I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the British leadership in its resolve to act hard and fast.\u201d Sapin said there was a new international drive to clamp down on tax secrecy and corruption because it was clear that there was massive global loss from tax evasion \u2013 \u201cfor developing countries, but also clearly for countries that are very, very developed\u201d. France, with Britain, has pushed for the creation of an international blacklist of tax havens and for the global community to deploy clear sanctions against any country that continues to facilitate tax evasion.  It is also pushing for new regulations that would lead to the automatic sharing of information about the true owners of complex shell companies and overseas trusts. Sapin said countries had the ability to clamp down fast on corruption, pointing to how France, Germany and Italy went on the offensive last year to better deal with the financing of terrorism. \u201cAt the heart of it, we can use the same tools that allow us to fight against financing of terrorism and laundering of all types,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Sapin apologised and admitted to behaving inappropriately towards a female journalist at the Davos conference in January, after earlier denying the claim.    Related: David Cameron under pressure to end tax haven secrecy    With the beleaguered Socialist leader, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, hoping to seek a second presidential term next year, the stakes are high for France at the anti-corruption summit.  Hollande \u2013 who said during his last presidential campaign that his only adversary was \u201cthe world of finance\u201d \u2013 is now under pressure to win back the leftwing voters who have deserted him.  France is also still reeling from what Sapin called the \u201cdeplorable\u201d scandal when J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, Hollande\u2019s first finance minister in charge of clamping down on tax fraud, was revealed to have hidden money in a secret Swiss account. Sapin proposed new legislation this year to improve France\u2019s transparency laws and provide better protection for whistleblowers.  Asked whether he would comment on the UK\u2019s EU referendum during his London visit, Sapin said: \u201cI\u2019ve learnt that saying from abroad what a people should do or choose is never very productive.  \u201cBut giving people \u2013 in this case, those favourable to staying in \u2013 a certain number of arguments, facts and perspectives to allow them to convince their own people, that\u2019s part of the role of European friends and allies of the UK.\u201d  He said France would attempt to do this \u201cdelicately\u201d. Looking to shore up its fragile state accounts, France has launched a campaign to encourage taxpayers to come clean on previously undeclared assets held abroad, and has clamped down on aggressive tax optimisation techniques by multinational companies. The crackdown yielded \u20ac12.2bn in 2015, up almost a fifth from the previous year. Big multinational companies have not been spared. The French tax office is seeking \u20ac1.6bn in back taxes from the US internet giant Google, refusing \u2013 unlike the UK \u2013 to strike a deal with the company. French authorities also sent McDonald\u2019s France a \u20ac300m bill for unpaid taxes on profits believed to have been funnelled through Luxembourg and Switzerland, reported the business magazine L\u2019Expansion last month.",
