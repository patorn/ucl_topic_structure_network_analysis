  "body": "Reports that Daniel Craig has turned down eleventy million pounds to return as James Bond I can take with equanimity. Reports that bookies have stopped taking bets on Tom Hiddleston replacing him I cannot. Indeed, I may consider chaining myself to the gates of Pinewoood Studios if the role of Bond does not go to Idris Elba, who is\u00a0obviously far more suited to its requirements than Hiddleston, whose serial willingness to discuss his craft tends\u00a0toward the excruciating. Then again, it was in the course of one of these perorations that the Night Manager star provided us with Kenneth Branagh\u2019s analysis of what he imagines both his and Elba\u2019s screen personas to be. \u201cKen told me that every\u00a0actor has something for free,\u201d Hiddleston explained. \u201cJack Nicholson has an irreverence for free, Anthony Hopkins has a majesty and gravitas for free. Idris Elba has a watchful gravitas for free. He explained that what I\u00a0have\u00a0for free is that I can\u2019t turn off my\u00a0intelligence.\u201d Or his self-awareness, apparently. Either way, who wants a Bond who can\u2019t turn off his intelligence? Years later and I\u2019m still not over the appalling Quantum of Solace, when a Bond who couldn\u2019t turn off his angst hauled it round five continents and did not once \u2013 in the entire movie! \u2013 even attempt to\u00a0have sex with his ridiculously hot leading lady. I can\u2019t imagine a more fundamental misunderstanding of what people go to the pictures to see, even within the oeuvre of Christopher Nolan. Furthermore, I would hope that choosing Elba would usher in a Bond era in which \u201cthe role\u201d and \u201cthe toll of the role\u201d are no longer regarded by the star as seemly subjects for interview discussion. From Craig\u2019s original discourses on the \u201cemotional depth\u201d of the character to the declaration that he would rather \u201cslash my wrists\u201d than play Bond again, the cumulative effect has cast the process of Being James Bond as slightly more spiritually immersive than doing Theatre of Cruelty for a six-month run inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Dude, it\u2019s not Breaking the Waves. You\u2019re a superspy! You drive Aston Martins! You\u00a0fly round the world and have a legover in every seven-star hotel! It\u2019s going to be FINE. Were Lost in Showbiz in charge of the Bond audition process, prospective candidates would be required to offer their own take on a cast-iron classic line from Octopussy. I hope you remember the scene \u2013 it\u2019s when Roger Moore is required to turn to a snake and say: \u201cHiss off!\u201d Connery could have delivered it, albeit in a manner that conveyed his suavely lazy contempt for the whole business, rather than the serpent (which he would have perfunctorily executed anyway). Dalton would have struggled, bless him. Brosnan could obviously have done it, in a faultlessly considerate single take. Despite having made two excellent Bond films out of a possible four, Craig could not. Hiddleston certainly couldn\u2019t. But Elba \u2026 Elba would ace it. There is \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 not quite a Nicolas Cage quality to Idris Elba. But there is certainly a 50% suspicion that he gets the joke, and that would feel most refreshing in the circs.",
