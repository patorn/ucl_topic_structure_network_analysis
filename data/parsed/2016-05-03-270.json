  "body": "As budget portraits go, Scott Morrison\u2019s picture on the front of the tabloids on his big morning was more eHarmony than enticing.   Related: Budget 2016: \u2018jobs and growth\u2019 pitch costs wealthy retirees, smokers and multinationals    The Courier Mail\u2019s headline was \u201cTreasurer to woo women back to work\u201d next to his best impression of puppy dog eyes.  The photo looked like it needed the Robert-Redford-style Vaseline lens photographic filter, but the words targeting female voters were certainly direct: \u201cMum\u2019s the word.\u201d The Daily Telegraph used the same photo but called him \u201cThe real fixer\u201d. They tracked down six other people called Scott Morrison \u2013 nicknamed the Sco-Bro\u2019s. We are all Scott Morrison now.  The love fest must have been a comfort to the treasurer on his first budget day, on which rests the fortunes of a first-term Coalition government.  Australia\u2019s very own everyman ditched the Comcar and drove to parliament in his Ford Territory, parking outside the ministerial entrance for the traditional budget walk. Morrison had just a touch of nerves showing, which was uncharacteristic for the artist formerly known as the immigration minister.  But the show must go on. As Liberal and Labor treasurers have done every year, Morrison walked from his car carrying his briefcase with his budget brochure was tucked under his arm. He was, according to the brochure, \u201csticking to our economic plan.\u201d One more photo opportunity with the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, and Morrison disappeared into the Treasury to attend to serious matters.  Or perhaps he and the prime minister were dancing to Wasn\u2019t It Good by the Treasurer\u2019s favourite singer, Tina Arena.   \u201cRemember the first time, we met each other, You were in your world and I was in mine, Breaking down the barriers, we broke all the rules, But wasn\u2019t it good, wasn\u2019t it fine.\u201d   By afternoon, he was back to his hard-man routine. Puppy dog eyes were gone. By the time he strode into the lock-up press conference, Morrison was leading with his chin and it was made of granite. The artist formerly known as the immigration minister had returned.  Much of the questioning focused around the fact that while there were tax cuts for people earning more than $80,000, there was very little for those below that magic line. Morrison suggested that by helping small to medium businesses with a lower tax rate, the government was helping lower income workers.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a job, you are not better off,\u201d he said. In other words, if you have a job, that\u2019s your help. Jobs and growth.  Usually, the Treasury does little cameos for various types of families to show how they are better off. Singles, couples, families. Why weren\u2019t they in the budget documents?   Related: Smokers to pay more than $45 for a packet of cigarettes from 2020    Morrison scoffed at the whole \u201cwinners and losers\u201d narrative.  \u201cOh,\u201d said he, \u201cAustralians have moved on from that.\u201d  Gone too, is the debt and deficit disaster language so redolent of the Abbott campaign.  Instead, Australia is on a \u201cglide path\u201d to jobs and growth. Work for the dole, so beloved of Tony Abbott, is pass\u00e9 too. The Coalition now prefers a plan for \u201cde-risking\u201d unemployment using an internship program called Youth Jobs PaTH \u2013 Prepare, Trial, Hire.  Rob Sitch and his Utopia crew would be proud.",
