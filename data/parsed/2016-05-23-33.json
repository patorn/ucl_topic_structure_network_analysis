  "body": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail business was warned before the sale of BHS that Dominic Chappell, the man who led the buyout, had been declared bankrupt and lacked experience in the retail industry. Paul Budge, the finance director of Arcadia, admitted that the company was aware that Chappell had been declared bankrupt at least once and was \u201ccautious\u201d about the sale, MPs heard on Monday. However, he and a collection of Arcadia executives defended the decision to sell BHS to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, despite the company collapsing into administration just 13 months after the deal. \u201cWe seriously believed there was a credible business plan and seriously believed he was surrounded by credible people,\u201d Budge said. Arcadia left \u00a394.5m of cash and debt facilities in BHS for Chappell, Budge added, as well as providing \u00a3110m of guarantees on loans and leaving \u00a3200m of property in the retailer. Budge said the \u201cmost heavy due diligence I have seen\u201d was conducted before the deal was completed. He blamed the collapse of BHS on Chappell failing to push through a turnaround plan for the retailer \u201cquickly enough\u201d. Anthony Grabiner, the chair of Arcadia, also defended his role, insisting he had been a \u201cresponsible\u201d chairman despite not being invited to a key board meeting that discussed the sale of BHS. The revelation Arcadia knew Chappell had been declared bankrupt will increase the pressure on Green over the demise of BHS. It raises further questions about why he sold the business to Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times.     Lord Grabiner speaking to the business select committee during their questioning of Arcadia executives on the BHS collapse. Photograph: PA    BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the retailer. Duff & Phelps, the administrators, are attempting to secure a rescue deal for BHS and its 11,000 workers. An announcement about the future of BHS is expected to be made by Wednesday. The potential saviours include Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves, who has formed an alliance with Turkish businessman Cafer Mahiro\u011flu, the owner of the value fashion retailer Select. There is also an international suitor circling BHS whose identity remains unclear. Members of the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating the company\u2019s collapse.  Before the Arcadia executives gave evidence, a Goldman Sachs boss revealed to MPs that he had told Budge about Chappell\u2019s background in the run-up to the deal. Anthony Gutman, the co-head of investment banking in Europe for Goldman Sachs, said he warned Arcadia there were \u201crisks attached to the proposal\u201d. Gutman also said Chappell\u2019s proposal to buy BHS was \u201cvery light on detail\u201d and included \u201cno business plan\u201d when he saw it just two months before the deal was completed. The Goldman Sachs banker said he provided \u201cinformal assistance\u201d to Arcadia during talks about the sale of BHS and was not paid a fee. Gutman said he was not asked to provide a recommendation about the deal but provide \u201cpreliminary observations\u201d about the offer from Retail Acquisitions, the consortium led by Chappell. \u201cWe provided a view that there were risks attached to the proposal,\u201d Gutman said.

Photograph: PA Wire/PA    MPs were also told at Monday\u2019s hearing that Green \u201cpaused\u201d proposals to restructure the BHS pension scheme before the sale to Retail Acquisitions. Tony Clare, a partner at accountants Deloitte who was advising Arcadia about its pension schemes, said talks about restructuring the BHS pension scheme were put on hold in September 2014 so that the retailer could focus on improving trade during the Christmas period. A preliminary proposal to the Pensions Regulator was then withdrawn. It has previously been reported that the regulator blocked Arcadia\u2019s plan to restructure the scheme, rather than the company withdrawing it. The plan, called Project Thor, was designed to offer BHS workers more attractive pension benefits than if the scheme entered into the Pension Protection Fund. However, it also involved Arcadia writing off intercompany loans and needed landlords to agree to substantial cuts to their rental payments from BHS. Now that BHS has entered administration, the pension scheme is set to enter the PPF, with a bailout set to cost around \u00a3275m. The Pensions Regulator is investigating whether Green should be forced to contribute towards the scheme. In the first hearing over the BHS scandal earlier this month, Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, told MPs that she only found out about the controversial sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions after reading about it in the newspapers. However, Green said that Titcomb had given \u201cincorrect\u201d evidence. He said the regulator had been emailed on 6 February last year about his ambition to sell the loss-making business and that he had met with the body on 4 March about the sale. Chris Martin, chairman of the BHS pension scheme, backed up Green\u2019s claims and said trustees had worked \u201copenly and collaboratively\u201d with the regulator since the summer of 2014. However, the Pensions Regulator hit back at Green, saying it was \u201cnot approached for clearance\u201d before the deal and was \u201cnot given sufficient information\u201d to assess the impact on the BHS pension scheme.",
