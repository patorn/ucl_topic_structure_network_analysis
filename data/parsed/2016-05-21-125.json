  "body": "Hello, Nile! Is it really 4am where you are now?Yes! I\u2019m in a car on the way to the airport. You\u2019ve said in the past that you don\u2019t sleep much. Do you think dreaming less has limited or boosted your creativity?It has been this way since I was five years old. It seems mathematically impossible for me to feel good, but I do! I actually think I dream more \u2014 even if I\u2019ve only been asleep for five minutes, I\u2019ll always wake up thinking it\u2019s the next day. I go right into REM sleep. You\u2019re bringing Fold, the festival you curate, to London this summer. Have you invited London\u2019s new mayor?That would be genius. Just before I left my house, they had Sadiq\u2019s remarks about Donald Trump on CNN. I would love him to come, that would be so super-cool. I\u2019ll try and track him down. He can have VIP tickets, on me! It\u2019ll be the first music festival ever held at Fulham Palace. Do you think they\u2019re worried people might dig up all the bishops buried there?Well, I hope that doesn\u2019t happen! Fold\u2019s reputation is very safe, and people are just there to have a good time. I curate each one like a local festival, thinking about what will play well in that area. On the first night, I have Alison Moyet and the Thompson Twins, then we work our way up to funk night. And Beck\u2019s playing on the second night!Yeah! He performed with me at the last Fold in New York. I know Beck quite well \u2014 we met at an Elton John party where Chic were the entertainment. I pulled Beck aside on the red carpet, told him I wanted to work with him. We ended up in the studio. That\u2019s a perk of Fold \u2014 I set aside a week during rehearsals to work with as many artists as I can on new recordings. Noel Gallagher recently said he was a big fan. Would you record with him?If I worked with Noel, we\u2019d figure out something great. I love him! He\u2019s amazing. He must be incredibly shy, because he always threatens to come to our gigs and never shows up. Maybe I should invite him to Fold. Dude, you just gave me an idea! Let\u2019s get him on stage at Fold. I\u2019m going to try to get in touch with him when I get back home. A new Chic album was due out last year. Is it finished yet?Originally, the album was going to be based on unreleased Chic material, but I started to feel that, as an artist, I\u2019ve learned a lot in the 20 years since [Chic\u2019s bass guitarist] Bernard [Edwards] passed away, and it felt unfair to limit the album. But I\u2019m working on it. I was in California a couple of weeks ago working with Lady Gaga, and the next day I started writing a song with Miguel; it was so good I sang it to Justin Timberlake over the phone and he loved it. Can you sing the song to me now?I can\u2019t do that! The hook will be out there and someone will sample it. But it\u2019s really catchy. I can\u2019t tell you about the Lady Gaga music, either, but I can tell you one thing \u2014 it\u2019s funky.

What does Bette have planned?We haven\u2019t figured it out yet. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019re performing together, but we go back a long way \u2014 when Chic were signed to Atlantic and had our first hit, the president of Atlantic wanted us to work with Bette Midler or the Rolling Stones. Instead, we chose Sister Sledge and came up with songs like Lost in Music and He\u2019s the Greatest Dancer. So, in a parallel universe, the Rolling Stones ended up recording We Are Family?Well, therein lies the rub: the Stones had their way of doing things. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d have sat back on the couch and let me and Bernard write all their songs. What\u2019s your favourite Village People deep cut?I like the record that broke them \u2014 San Francisco. Their first album is compositional genius; I heard it around the same time I heard Donna Summer\u2019s Love to Love You Baby, and those records inspired me to come up with the whole Chic concept. People see them as a novelty, but what is Kiss? What are Slipknot? It\u2019s funny that rock bands do the novelty thing and get away with it. Did you view Gaga\u2019s Grammys Bowie tribute as a success?Yes \u2013 and more. We had a massive job: Gaga really wanted to tell David\u2019s story in music, and I had to remind her we only had a five-minute segment. We figured out a way to make it work. A lot of people don\u2019t understand that we gave a lot of thought to it; it was just as much my input as hers. Good luck with the festival, Nile!Thanks! And if you can hook me up with the mayor, tell him it\u2019s an open invitation! He seems like a totally cool guy. I\u2019ll get him to bring Noel along.Awesome. That would be the ultimate hookup.
