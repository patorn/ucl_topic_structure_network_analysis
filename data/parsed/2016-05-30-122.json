It's okay.\n      \n       The Road, Cormac McCarthy \n       Worstward Ho by Samuel Beckett\n       Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood\n       About a Boy by Nick Hornby\n      \n     My uncle Toby blushed as red as scarlet as Trim went on \u2013 but it was not a blush of guilt \u2013 of modesty \u2013 or of anger \u2013\u2013 it was a blush of joy; \u2013\u2013 he was fired with Corporal Trim\u2019s project and description.\n      \n       Toby\u2019s Room by Pat Barker \n       Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne \n       Tom Jones by Henry Fielding\n       Men at Arms by Evelyn Waugh\n      \n     Yesterday morning I went to the doctor.
