  "body": "A woman who inflicted electric shocks on a toddler in her care using a dog training collar has been told that she will be jailed.  Lanna Monaghan, 34, admitted five charges of assault at Edinburgh high court on Wednesday. The offences took place in the Highlands in 2014 and 2015. Monaghan had seen the device being used and told a pet owner: \u201cIf it works on a dog it will work on kids.\u201d Former soldier Monaghan also admitted that she kicked and bit the child, hit him so hard with a wooden spoon that it broke and subjected him to cold showers. She admitted to police that she had a temper and could \u201czone out\u201d and would go \u201cout of control\u201d. After she was shown photographs of injuries found on the little boy, the judge, Lady Rae, asked if those on his neck were consistent with what appeared to be electrodes on the collar. She was told they were and said: \u201cSo it must have been applied on a number of occasions.\u201d The judge told Monaghan: \u201cThis is an appalling catalogue of charges of physical cruelty, I think that is the only way to describe it, to a toddler over 15 months. \u201cRealistically it would be very difficult to avoid custody in a case such as this. This was a toddler, a defenceless child.\u201d Monaghan pleaded guilty to repeatedly fixing a dog collar with an electric shock device attached around the boy\u2019s neck and inflicting shocks on him in July last year.  She also admitted forcibly placing him in a shower and turning it on and off while kicking the boy on the body. Monaghan, who served in the army for nine years, also pleaded guilty to biting him on the ear and repeatedly striking him with a wooden spoon. The abuse ended when the boy was aged three after a concerned woman contacted the authorities.  Advocate depute Jane Farquharson said: \u201c[The collar] works by a remote control which when activated delivers an electric shock through the collar that the dog feels on its neck.\u201d Farquharson said that when police saw the little boy they noted he had injuries to his face. She added: \u201cWhen taken to the hospital and medically examined a number of non-accidental injuries were noted. This included multiple bruising on the body and multiple red marks on the neck at a fixed distance from each other.\u201d A tearful Monaghan later told a psychiatric nurse that she got \u201cfired up\u201d and described having continuing \u201canger issues\u201d. She told police: \u201cI am truly sorry for what happened, I can\u2019t believe it happened.\u201d She claimed the child \u201cpushes my buttons, spitting on me, peeing on the floor and being sick on the floor\u201d.  She admitted that at times she would be crouched down to the child\u2019s eye level, shouting and swearing aggressively at him when he wet himself and cried. The prosecutor said: \u201cShe did not appear to recognise the possibility that the child was reacting involuntarily and through fear.\u201d Monaghan was remanded in custody ahead of a further hearing at the high court in Glasgow in July.",
