Labor has said it wants to scrap the tax but won\u2019t commit to ditch it until it sees modelling of the true amount of revenue that would be foregone, as it claims the measure cannot raise $540m because the tax is deterring holidaymakers from coming to Australia. On Tuesday the assistant treasurer, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, announced the government would delay the backpacker tax for six months until 1 January 2017. The delay would cost $40m, she said. O\u2019Dwyer said in the meantime the government will conduct a review and cabinet will reconsider the tax in October or November.   Related: Australian election 2016: Coalition delays start of backpacker tax \u2013 politics live    The backpacker tax, which was due to take effect from 1 July, was a surprise inclusion in the 2015 budget estimated to raise $540m.  Currently, backpackers are able to access the $18,200 tax-free threshold, the low-income tax offset and the lower tax rate of 19% for income above the tax-free threshold up to $37,000. As a result of the proposed changes, holidaymakers will be treated as non-residents and taxed at 32.5% from their first dollar. The tourism sector warned the measure would make Australia a less competitive tourist destination. O\u2019Dwyer said: \u201cSo many rural and regional communities rely on working holidaymakers to come into those communities to be the labour force that\u2019s necessary at times of peak demand.\u201d \u201cVery clearly the government has listened to rural and regional communities, the government\u2019s listened very much to those in the tourism sector that have raised these concerns,\u201d she said. Asked whether the 32.5% backpacker rate could be lowered to 19%, O\u2019Dwyer said the review would consider changing the tax rate to ensure Australia is globally competitive. The six-month delay in the tax comes just two weeks after it was retained in the 2016 budget. Margy Osmond, the chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, told Guardian Australia she welcomed the review but \u201cwe\u2019d prefer to see it axed \u2013 it\u2019s bad policy and we\u2019ve made that clear\u201d. Osmond said the government\u2019s estimate of $540m revenue was based on treasury projections the tax would not reduce the number of holidaymakers coming to Australia, but since the 2015 budget there has been a 6 or 7% drop in applications for working holiday visas. \u201cBackpackers deciding where to go on holiday will know in the next year they\u2019ll potentially be paying this tax, and they\u2019ll just pick somewhere else.\u201d National Farmers\u2019 Federation president, Brent Finlay, said the review would not address the short-term workforce crisis facing the farm sector now because of the backpacker tax. \u201cA six month delay doesn\u2019t alleviate that concern, and for many means that the tax will now take effect halfway through their busiest time of the year. Farmers across the country will be wondering how much area to put under crop, if already dwindling backpacker numbers drop off even further at that time.\u201d The National Union of Workers, which represents workers in the agricultural sector, also called for the tax to be axed. The union said it had concerns the tax will provide a disincentive for employers to pay workers appropriately, and instead encourage a black market economy with cash-in hand wages, from dodgy contractors who underpay and exploit their workers. Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, told Guardian Australia he was \u201cdetermined to kill this tax and kill it now\u201d. \u201cThis is a stunt obviously designed to push the issue beyond the election ... We\u2019ll believe the government will ditch the tax when it stops booking the revenue on the forward estimates.\u201d Fitzgibbon said Labor wants to kill the tax now, but stopped short of committing to do so until the true cost of the measure is known. On Tuesday Labor\u2019s tourism spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said delaying the backpacker tax would not fix the problem. \u201cWhat we have here is an ill-thought-out policy, they\u2019ve banked $500m in savings, but what they haven\u2019t taken into account is the flight of backpackers which means they don\u2019t pay any tax at all because they\u2019re not here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who earn money in regional Australia by and large spend money in regional Australia, and we\u2019re concerned about the impact on jobs.\u201d Albanese said Labor would not have instituted the backpacker tax but refused to commit to scrap it. Instead, Labor will \u201csit down with the tourism and agriculture sector and come up with a solution\u201d, he said. Albanese said the $500m was a \u201cfalse save\u201d. Labor has asked the government for modelling to explain the revenue figure and will finalise its position after the modelling is provided. The Greens oppose the backpacker tax. The agriculture spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, has described it as \u201cgrab for revenue that ignores the impact on growers\u201d. \u201cThe government\u2019s proposed delay of the tax is a cynical election move to delay the operation of the tax until after the election. The government should abandon the tax now.\u201d",
