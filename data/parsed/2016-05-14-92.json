Up on the stage sat Steve Coppell, squeezed rather uncomfortably on a sofa alongside Mark Bright, John Salako and Alan Pardew, as images of tracksuited teams emerging through a haze of red and blue balloons at the old Wembley stadium flickered across the big screen at their back. The footage, now more than a quarter of a century old, has a grainy quality to it but, from their seats in the cinema\u2019s front few rows, the club\u2019s current first-team squad still lapped it all up. Few in their number would recall 1990 and that meeting with Manchester United, back when Alex Ferguson was relatively fresh faced if fretting over his future, but they must have recognised well enough the qualities that propelled Palace into their only previous FA Cup final appearance. \u201cIt was no accident we reached that stage,\u201d said Coppell. \u201cWe were there because of hard work and commitment and all those players felt they had something to prove.   Related: Joe Ledley fractures fibula and is out of Crystal Palace\u2019s FA Cup final    \u201cThey were hungry and there are shades of that same mentality in Alan\u2019s side now. There\u2019s a doggedness about this squad at the moment and you can sense they\u2019re determined to take their chance. Players will look each other in the eye in the dressing room before a game and know the phonies who are just saying \u2018we can do this\u2019 without properly believing it. But, in an age when so many players are singled out for criticism for not having that real desire, I see the same hunger we had 26 years ago in every single one of the current team.\u201d Pardew\u2019s crop have their own opportunity to claim Palace\u2019s first major honour in next Saturday\u2019s rematch with United. For Ferguson teetering on the brink back then, read Louis van Gaal now. Palace, just as then, are seeking to make history yet the comparisons with Coppell\u2019s rough diamonds probably run deeper still. They had rather gatecrashed that occasion all those years ago, unseating the land\u2019s dominant force, Liverpool, in an improbably glorious semi-final at Villa Park. Theirs was a team largely compiled on a shoestring over years of financial toil in the second tier, with a core of players \u2013 Andy Gray, Pardew, Phil Barber and Ian Wright \u2013 having been developed and hardened in non-league. United boasted a million-pound pedigree throughout their squad. Coppell, a veteran of more than 300 league appearances for United before a knee injury forced his retirement at 28, was reliant on youth-team graduates such as Salako and Richard Shaw or players such as Geoff Thomas, Gary O\u2019Reilly, Bright and John Pemberton who had either been rejected by the elite or forged reputations in the lower leagues. Nigel Martyn and Andy Thorn had cost \u00a31.65m between them in the wake of a 9-0 thrashing at Anfield that season. Even so, the entire starting XI at Wembley cost less than the \u00a32.3m Ferguson had forked out to prise Gary Pallister from Middlesbrough at the start of that season. \u201cThat was Steve\u2019s blueprint for a Palace team,\u201d said Bright, whom Coppell had plucked from Leicester\u2019s reserves. \u201cHe liked to sign players who had a bit of anger in them, players who\u2019d been released or told \u2018no\u2019 by clubs higher up the ladder but wanted to make a point. We were all from the lower divisions, all about the same age and on the same wavelength. We had that passion, drive, speed, skill \u2026 that was his plan, to create that culture around the place. The team Alan has helped build is very similar, full of hard workers and grafters, as well as those with a bit of flair. Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha, on their day, would give any full-back in the world a problem with their tricks, their strength and pace. They have that skill, that speed, but also that same endeavour and drive.\u201d Coppell\u2019s side thrived on width to supply the prolific Wright and Bright, but there were similarities, too, between Thorn and O\u2019Reilly and the rugged, old-school nature of Palace\u2019s current centre-halves, Damien Delaney and Scott Dann, who typify the team\u2019s ominous threat from set pieces. Bolasie\u2019s opener against Watford in the semi-final could have been lifted straight from Villa Park and Pardew\u2019s celebrated winner in the 4-3 success over Liverpool all those years ago. Then there is the instinctive finishing of Dwight Gayle. The 25-year-old came late to the professional game having made his name in non-league but, after an injury-interrupted season largely spent frustrated on the fringes, the most natural finisher at the club may have timed to perfection his charge back into contention.

Back in 1990, Palace\u2019s talismanic striker had had his campaign cruelly interrupted by fractures to his shin suffered in separate fixtures against Liverpool and Derby. He missed the semi-final and his cameo at Wembley, with his team trailing 2-1 and the clock ticking down, was a first appearance in almost two months: cue the collection from Bright three minutes after his introduction, the glide away from a grounded Mike Phelan and inside Pallister, and the accurate finish slid past an increasingly shellshocked Jim Leighton. Wright had never played at Wembley before and had begun his day awestruck by the size of the baths in the home dressing room. He ended it as a household name. \u201cBrighty had looked back at me when we went out for the pre-match warm-up and said: \u2018This is it, boy,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe were living the dream. I thought my heart was going to explode when I scored that goal.\u201d His second, volleyed in two minutes into extra-time from Salako\u2019s cross, would thrust Palace tantalisingly 3-2 ahead. \u201cThe FA Cup final was the biggest game in the calendar, the showpiece for the whole season, and one of the few matches actually on the box,\u201d said Bright. \u201cFootball is diluted these days, on television every night of the week, but it was different back then. The boss had taken us to look around the stadium in the buildup, walking on the pitch to try and understand what it was all about, but the whole occasion was something else. From driving up Wembley Way, the fans hammering on the side of the coach, to the balloons and the noise. The telegrams waiting for us in the changing rooms, those yellow envelopes full of messages from people from school, family, friends \u2026 it was special.\u201d   Related: Pardew hopes Dwight Gayle can follow Ian Wright\u2019s lead for Crystal Palace    Ultimately, it is an occasion on which Palace reflect with a nagging sense of regret. Mark Hughes ended up matching Wright\u2019s double, equalising seven minutes from time when, as Coppell admitted, United were \u201cabsolutely battering\u201d his adopted club. The 3-3 draw was thrilling. The replay five days later, with Leighton replaced by Les Sealey and Palace clad in alien black and yellow stripes, was ugly, fractious and won by Lee Martin\u2019s solitary goal just before the hour. The opportunity passed up has played on Coppell\u2019s mind over the years, his decision to leave his players \u201cfor a few minutes before the second game to consider what the match could mean for the rest of their lives\u201d having, in hindsight, perhaps hindered their prospects. \u201cThey were so charged, there was so much electricity in that dressing room,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they got out there, they just didn\u2019t play.\u201d He points out now it is easy, on big occasions, \u201cto have paralysis by analysis\u201d and that is a message the current squad \u2013 even with the input of Pardew\u2019s almost resident sports psychologist, Jeremy Snape \u2013 might take on board. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure you don\u2019t end up with any regrets,\u201d said Bright. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have given any more in 1990 but we just weren\u2019t quite good enough. But this team, on their day, are good enough. \u201cWhat message would I give them? Just to make sure you give everything you have. You may never have another chance \u2013 some great players out there never play in an FA Cup final \u2013 so give your best and, if everything falls into place and you get a bit of luck, you can make it happen. We\u2019ve got enough in our team to win this game.\u201d     Mark Bright celebrates as Jim Leighton and Steve Bruce fail to keep out the first Palace goal in 1990, scored by Gary O\u2019 Reilly (not pictured).
