The reigning Olympic and world long jump champion believes that Russian athletes should be barred from the Games because of their government\u2019s central involvement in the country\u2019s widespread doping scandal. However, he expects the International Association of Athletics Federations to find a way to lift their suspension next month. \u201cWith Russia we\u2019ve found out that it\u2019s government-led systematic doping, so surely the country has to be punished,\u201d said Rutherford. \u201cBut sadly I think political arms will be twisted.\u201d   Related: Russians expected to be among failed doping tests from 2008 Olympics    When asked whether he thought the International Olympic Committee did not want to make a tough decision on Russia, Rutherford nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny one,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd because of everything we\u2019ve heard about corruption you fear it\u2019s still ongoing and that again palms will be greased and we\u2019ll be seeing people back in. In any other business those people would be removed, and probably their chance of working again would be destroyed, but it seems to be not the case in sport.\u201d Rutherford made it clear that he felt sympathy for Russian athletes who had never taken drugs, but urged the IOC needed to look at the bigger picture. He also demanded it spend more money on retesting samples to cheats. \u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re going to retest 250 samples from London 2012, but they should be retesting every single one, and keep doing it every single year,\u201d he said. \u201cFunding\u2019s obviously an issue but sport needs to find the money. The IOC makes an awful lot of money from the Olympics, they need to start looking at retesting everybody.\u201d The long jumper, who also called for a new union to speak up for athletes\u2019 rights, praised organisers of Friday\u2019s Great City Games in Manchester for not inviting people with a drug-tainted past. \u201cI think that\u2019s a great way of approaching the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t deny we\u2019re in a really bad place, I hate having to always be trying to be that guy that\u2019s saying: \u2018No no, don\u2019t worry, there are people who are doing it right,\u2019 but some people just don\u2019t believe anything any more, which is a real problem.\u201d The 29-year-old also revealed that in September he will stage a new long jump event in his back garden, which has an IAAF-approved pit, to show the good side of the sport.

I think I will actually have an exceptionally good field of jumpers, better than a Diamond League.\u201d Rutherford said that the London 2012 silver medallist, Mitch Watt, and Fabrice Lapierre, who was second at the world championships in Beijing, had already agreed to show up, alongside Michel Torneus and Christian Taylor. \u201cI also want to get funding behind it so the athletes can be paid,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe I can create something that I feel the rest of the sport isn\u2019t doing.\u201d He cannot foresee any problems with his neighbours in Woburn, Bedfordshire, either. \u201cI don\u2019t have any, that\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got one over the road, Barry, he\u2019ll be having a whale of a time.\u201d However, Rutherford said that Carl Lewis, who recently criticised the length of his jumps, would not get an invite. \u201cAt the end of my career, I\u2019ll look myself in the mirror and my kids in the eye and know what I have done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s other people in the world that can\u2019t do that. And Carl is one of them.\u201d",
