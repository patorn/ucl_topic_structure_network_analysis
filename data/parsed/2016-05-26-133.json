  "body": "\u201cI wish people would think of me as a musician who writes novels, instead of a novelist who writes music on the side,\u201d Anthony Burgess wrote in the Economist in 1991. Fat chance of that, especially after the release of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s film of Burgess\u2019s novel A Clockwork Orange . But Burgess kept composing \u2013 his lengthy worklist includes everything from recorder sonatas to perhaps the least likely operetta ever, based on Joyce\u2019s Ulysses \u2013 and the US conductor Paul Phillips has been championing his music.  This disc starts with Mr WS, a jaunty mock-Tudor ballet suite nodding to Walton\u2019s Shakespearian music, and the similarly Waltonesque Marche pour une R\u00e9volution, both dispatched with spirit if not ideal refinement by Phillips\u2019s student orchestra; but keep listening and a more interesting voice emerges in Mr Burgess\u2019s Almanack, a sequence of 14 modernist-inflected short movements for chamber ensemble written in 1987.",
