Bartholomew Cuthbert Joly de Lotbiniere, a history graduate from York University, will go on trial in February for charges relating to rape, two sexual assaults and an attempted sexual assault on one alleged victim in June 2014. The 21-year-old appeared at York crown court on Thursday and denied the charges. Joly de Lotbiniere\u2019s team reached the semi-final of this year\u2019s University Challenge, the BBC2 quiz show hosted by Jeremy Paxman, before being knocked out by Peterhouse college, Cambridge, in February.
