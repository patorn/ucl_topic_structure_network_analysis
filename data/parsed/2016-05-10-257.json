  "body": "The Queensland government is facing calls to act on royal commission findings to abolish a legal loophole that prevents victims of child sexual abuse suing for compensation after the age of 21. Queensland, which has one of Australia\u2019s most restrictive regimes for victims seeking redress, is yet to make any move towards removing time limits used by churches and elite private schools to reduce their exposure to abuse claims. That is despite the commission making it a final recommendation eight months ago and three other states since \u2013 Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia \u2013 either passing or tabling reforms in parliament.   Related: Anglican Church refuses to refund fees to abused former students, inquiry told    A group of researchers, lawyers and advocates are leading a push for the Palaszczuk government to remove what they say remains a critical obstacle to justice for victims potentially numbering in their thousands.  They include Warren Strange, a former top official with Queensland\u2019s anti-corruption agency, who now runs Knowmore legal service, acting for what he describes as a constant stream of victims coming forward in middle age. Strange told Guardian Australia that ending the time limit would \u201csignificantly help deliver justice for so many people who haven\u2019t achieved it, haven\u2019t had any prospect of achieving justice\u201d. He said most claims in Queensland were personal injury suits that gave plaintiffs a three-year time limit after turning 18, which \u201cwhich works well if I was to fall over on the stairs because of some hazard that was negligently left, but for personal injury claims arising out of child sexual abuse, is completely inappropriate\u201d. \u201cOur legal service is constantly seeing people coming forward now for the first time to make a disclosure who for 20, 30, 40, 50 years, have not felt safe or supported to an extent that they could make a disclosure,\u201d Strange said.  \u201cColin\u201d, a victim of serial paedophile Kevin Lynch while a student at the Anglican church-run St Paul\u2019s high school in Brisbane, said he only recognised he was suffering the symptoms of trauma from the abuse after turning 40.

It feels a little bit like further abuse, the law saying, \u2018Oh, you didn\u2019t sue? You should have sued by the time you were 21. Too bad. Suck it\u2019.\u201d  Strange and other reform advocates have organised a forum at state parliament on Tuesday to be hosted by Shannon Fentiman, the state minister for communities, women and children and child safety. Child protection campaigner Hetty Johnston said attorney general Yvette D\u2019Ath recently indicated she was open to considering the reform. But the government has not responded to other advocates and has made no commitments. Johnston said any opposition to the reform was about \u201cprotecting institutions, their bank balances and their wallets\u201d.  \u201cI think the threat is not as great as they perceive it to be because victims of crime are not after the money. They want to be believed, supported, helped,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it does open up the coffers [of institutions] and they\u2019re exposed now to a whole set of risks that they\u2019ve never been exposed to before.  \u201cSo it\u2019s good for children everywhere because what it means is that institutions now have to have their act together, they have to have risk management policies in place to protect their money and that\u2019s going to motivate them far more than protecting children. Sadly, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Warwick Middleton, the president of the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, said the symptoms of trauma from child sex abuse almost always took many years to show up.  Children were likely to remain quiet about abuse because it was typically secret, a source of shame, often accompanied by threats from the abuser and sometimes triggering a \u201cdense amnesia\u201d suppressing traumatic memories, he said. Most were \u201cnot remotely ready\u201d to legally confront their abusers \u2013 or the institutions that harboured them \u2013 by age 21.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare case that someone who\u2019s been extensively abused to the point they\u2019re badly damaged, somehow find the resources before the age of 21 to put it all together to instruct a lawyer and to take civil action against an institution. I mean I can\u2019t think of a case that I\u2019ve seen [of someone] who\u2019s done that.\u201d Ben Mathews, a legal academic from the Queensland University of Technology, said while evidence indicated about 12% of girls and 4% of boys in broader society suffered \u201cvery serious, penetrative sexual abuse\u201d, most would not make civil claims. \u201cThe reason for that is it\u2019s costly, it take a lot of time, it\u2019s emotionally traumatic and a lot of offenders do not have the funds to make them worth suing,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe experience in other jurisdictions where the statutory time limit has been lifted such as in Canada, has shown that you do not get a flood of cases. \u201c[But] without exception, every survivor I\u2019ve spoken to about this ardently supports the reforms \u2026 this means an awful lot to every survivor.\u201d",
