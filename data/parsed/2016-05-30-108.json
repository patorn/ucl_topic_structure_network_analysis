  "body": "David Cameron has said he is proud to campaign with Sadiq Khan to stay in the EU, weeks after claiming Labour\u2019s London mayor was unfit for office because of links to Islamist extremists. The prime minister was accused of participating in a racist campaign against Khan during the mayoral contest, but the two politicians buried the hatchet on Monday as Cameron praised Khan for being a \u201cproud Muslim, a proud Brit and a proud Londoner\u201d.   Brexit explained: key players   Speaking in Roehampton, south-west London, Cameron said: \u201cLet me first of all congratulate Sadiq on his victory. He talked about his father. He\u2019s the son of a bus driver. I\u2019m the son of a stockbroker, which is not quite so romantic.  \u201cBut he makes an important point about our country. In one generation someone who\u2019s a proud Muslim, a proud Brit and a proud Londoner can become mayor of the greatest city on Earth. That says something about our country.  \u201cThere are still glass ceilings we have got to smash. There\u2019s still discrimination we have got to fight. I\u2019m proud to be here with the mayor of London - with the Labour mayor of London \u2013 on this vital issue.\u201d It is a remarkable change of tone since Cameron used prime minister\u2019s questions during the London mayoral campaign to cast doubt on Khan\u2019s judgment, claiming the Labour MP had repeatedly shared a stage with an Islamist extremist.    Related: David Cameron and Sadiq Khan plan pro-EU joint appearance    Michael Fallon, a Conservative cabinet minister, later had to apologise for repeating that claim outside the House of Commons, after it emerged that the cleric in question had advocated for an Islamic state, rather than for the terror group Islamic State. After Khan won a landslide victory, senior Tories lined up to criticise the Conservative mayoral campaign against Khan, saying it could damage community relations with Muslims. However, the new mayor has said it is not in London\u2019s interests for him to hold grudges and be at permanent war with the prime minister. Addressing activists at the event, Khan said: \u201cThere are many things upon which the prime minister and I will disagree. But what\u2019s really important is when it\u2019s in London\u2019s interests for the mayor of London and the government to work closely together, we will work closely together.\u201d     Khan and Cameron walk past Britain Stronger in Europe\u2019s list of five pledges. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA    He implicitly criticised the remain campaign being run by the prime minister by saying he wanted a positive case for the EU to be set out. At the event, Cameron and Khan unveiled a pledge card that will be distributed around the country in the name of Britain Stronger in Europe, which lists five things that will be guaranteed in the event of Britain voting to remain in the EU. The five promises are: full access to the EU\u2019s single market, workers\u2019 rights protected, keeping the European arrest warrant, a special status for the UK in Europe, and economic stability. Cameron has already attended pro-EU campaign events with Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, and Tessa Jowell, the former Labour culture secretary, but a joint appearance with Khan \u2013 arguably the most powerful Labour politician in the UK \u2013 is an important coup.    Related: Sadiq Khan accuses Cameron of taking tactics \u2018from Trump playbook\u2019    Labour supporters are much more inclined to vote to stay than Conservative supporters, and the remain campaign knows it has to mobilise the Labour vote if it wants to win on 23 June. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and Alan Johnson, chair of Labour In for Britain, have ruled out sharing a platform with Cameron, mindful that Labour\u2019s decision to campaign alongside the Tories in the Scottish independence referendum was subsequently cited as one reason why its vote collapsed in the 2015 general election.",
