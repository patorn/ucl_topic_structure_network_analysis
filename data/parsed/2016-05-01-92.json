They weren\u2019t going to sign up to a \u00a39.99-a-month plan just for a Beyonc\u00e9 album, they decided, and off they went in search of illegal downloads. When Drake\u2019s new album appeared as an exclusive on a different streaming service five days later, it happened again. For those of us who recall a time, not so long ago, when a single chart CD cost \u00a315.99, it is easy to mock the self-righteousness of supposed music fans who balk at spending \u00a39.99 a month for unlimited access to millions of songs. But it\u2019s no longer just one monthly payment. Exclusive content deals mean that to keep on top of things, UK music fans might need subscriptions to both Spotify and Apple Music. Maybe Deezer or Google Play seem a good bet. Then there\u2019s Soundcloud, when that goes premium, along with YouTube\u2019s new Red offering. Add this to subscriptions many also pay to Netflix, Sky or Amazon Video, plus myriad sports packages and the BBC licence fee, and entertainment looks pretty expensive. One of the noisiest companies trying to add to music fans\u2019 monthly bill is Tidal \u2013 home of that Beyonc\u00e9 stream \u2013 which Jay Z relaunched last March after buying it from its original Norwegian owners for $56m (\u00a338.3m). Tidal\u2019s livestreamed relaunch event was quite something, with 16 pop titans taking to the stage, where each signed a pledge. The big idea: unlike other services, Tidal would be owned by artists (it has been suggested that the artists on stage that day were each given 3% equity) and would pay all artists fairly. There were echoes of how United Artists attempted to change the Hollywood system almost a century earlier, though Charlie Chaplin didn\u2019t book Alicia Keys to quote Nietzsche. \u201cWe\u2019re gathered,\u201d Keys said at one point, \u201cwith one voice, in unity, in the hopes that today will be another one of\u00a0those moments in time. A moment that will forever change the course of music history.\u201d Tidal was asking fans to form an emotional relationship with a streaming service. It is a standard trick in a crowded marketplace: if Compare the Market can use soft toys to conjure affection for car insurance, why can\u2019t Tidal wheel out Madonna as their own aristocratic meerkat?

Noel Gallagher asked: \u201cWho do these people think they are, the fucking Avengers?\u201d When Jay Z told Billboard \u201cpeople really feel like music\u00a0is free, but will pay $6 for water\u201d, he was trying to make a point about how little people value art. Unfortunately, he made a different point: that he thinks normal people pay $6 for a bottle of water. Search Google for the words \u201cTidal\u201d and \u201cbotched\u201d and you\u2019ll get an idea not just of how many mistakes the company has made in the intervening 13 months, but of how gleefully Tidal\u2019s shortcomings have been reported around the world. It is an irresistible narrative: Jay Z, the consummate modern mogul, has made a mistake. Bloomberg Businessweek went with the headline \u201cThat\u2019s Business, Man: Why Jay Z\u2019s Tidal Is a Complete Disaster\u201d. Forbes had \u201cJay-Z\u2019s Tidal Is Tone Deaf And Won\u2019t Save the Music Industry\u201d. Stereogum opted for: \u201cBehold the Half-Assed Hubris of Tidal\u201d. It may be worth wondering why a streaming service that is home to some of the planet\u2019s most powerful black artists has come in for such huge push-back from some sections of the media, but it is also fair to say that Tidal\u2019s first year under Jay Z\u2019s control was not a total success. Its CEO, Andy Chen, left after three weeks; his interim replacement, Peter Tonstad, lasted three months. Drake, who had been mooted as a Tidal artist-owner, helped launch Apple Music instead, and his current exclusive with that service underlines his allegiance to it. In October, during an unrelated copyright infringement trial, Jay Z listed his numerous business interests. But he forgot one of his investments. \u201cYou have a music streaming service, don\u2019t you?\u201d he was asked. \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d was the reply. \u201cForgot about that.\u201d At the end of last month, he launched a lawsuit against Tidal\u2019s former owners. Tidal has become a laughing stock. One major artist manager I speak to says that \u201cit stank from the very beginning\u201d, but is it really a bad service? It is precisely one year since Jay Z took the step of tweeting a lengthy defence of Tidal. \u201cWe are here for the long haul,\u201d he stated at one point. \u201cPlease give us a chance to grow and get better.\u201d Twelve months on, Tidal has indeed grown (it now boasts more than three million users) and it has got better. I mainly use Spotify and Apple Music \u2013 indeed I contribute playlists to Spotify and curate for Apple Music \u2013 but when I find myself on Tidal it does the job I need it to do. It has nearly doubled its available tracks, increased coverage from 31 countries to 46, and live-streamed shows including the third-season blowout for Kanye\u2019s Yeezy shoe and clothing line at Madison Square Gardens. Regardless of how well they have been rolled out, there have been big album exclusives from Kanye (The Life of Pablo hit 250m streams in 10 days), Rihanna (13m streams in 14 hours), and as of this weekend Beyonc\u00e9, whose Lemonade appeared without a hitch.     Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade was an exclusive on Tidal. Photograph: Handout/Getty Images    Then there\u2019s Prince, who withdrew his catalogue from all streaming services except Tidal, and debuted the albums HitNRun and HitNRun Phase Two through it. Tidal wisely decided against trying to capitalise on Prince\u2019s death. Equally, though, striking a deal with a chap who was not easily persuaded when it came to allowing others to exploit his work must have paid dividends. If Tidal was good enough for Prince, maybe it should be good enough for the rest of us. Music Business Worldwide editor Tim Ingham, who has been closely following Tidal\u2019s ups and downs, reckons that it is wrong to totally write it off. \u201cTidal\u2019s not only showing rival services up with its exclusive content, but also the slickness of its presentation \u2013 which is undeniable,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you forget the circus surrounding its creation and management failings, Tidal, the product, is an excellent streaming service.\u201d Still, it has entered a crowded marketplace where companies are competing to stake a claim on streaming while the technology is still in its relative infancy (on-demand streaming doubled in the US in 2015, and increased by 82% in the UK). In a world where Spotify recently raised an extra \u00a31bn in funding, the $56m Jay Z paid for Tidal is loose change. \u201cEvery established, non-Apple/Google-owned player I can think of which hasn\u2019t gone bust yet is losing millions of dollars every month,\u201d Ingham argues. \u201cMusic streaming is an economically torturous game, and Tidal is the runt of the litter.\u201d Spotify currently has at least 30 million paying customers and another 70 million using its free tier. Apple Music stands at 13 million and Tidal at just three million. So if Tidal is the underdog, how come nobody\u2019s cheering the company on? Its pledge to pay more to artists is unequivocally a good thing, right? Unfortunately for Tidal, the backlash that followed Tidal\u2019s star-studded launch suggests potential users were so dazzled by Deadmau5\u2019s glistening helmet that they couldn\u2019t see the smaller artists who would also stand to benefit. Tidal\u2019s high-quality streams, meanwhile, have been popular with early adopters, but are of little interest to mass-market music fans. It is worth noting that Tidal\u2019s reliance on exclusive album streams from big-name acts can backfire. Take Kanye\u2019s The Life of Pablo, which debuted on Tidal. \u201cMy album will never never never be on Apple,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cAnd it will never be for sale ... You can only get it on Tidal.\u201d The album is now on sale elsewhere, and streaming on all major services. One fan was so dismayed by this perceived betrayal that he filed a lawsuit against Kanye and Tidal, a response so melodramatic that even Kanye himself might grudgingly approve. Most fans won\u2019t sue Tidal, but after Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade appeared for sale on iTunes less than a day into Tidal\u2019s exclusive, it is easy to see how they might grow wary of signing up to any service just to hear one album. On Monday, Matthew Hussey, editor-in-chief of the technology website the Next Web, published an article titled \u201cWhy You Shouldn\u2019t Subscribe to Tidal, Even if You\u2019re a Beyonc\u00e9 Fan\u201d. \u201cOf course, there was nothing explicit in Tidal\u2019s promotion that said, \u2018No one else will have this\u2019,\u201d he tells me now. \u201cBut it must feel like a slap in the face to have signed up \u2013 you can\u2019t sign up without giving bank details \u2013 only to find another service has it.\u201d Restricting availability of music to one service \u2013 windowing \u2013 is one of the key ways streaming services can differentiate their offerings, and in business terms it makes sense. Apple Music has been doing this a lot, too. Windowing is also controversial, particularly with fans who resent having to maintain numerous active subscriptions in the hope that they will hear new releases. I approached Tidal for comment about this and other topics. The company did agree to answer questions over email, but sadly nothing turned up. Looking on the bright side, their responses will probably appear on Spotify in a week or two. Deezer is a streaming service that can boast of up to twice as many users as Tidal. While Tidal and Apple Music have thrown equity and money at exclusives, its approach has been similar to Spotify\u2019s. Christian Harris, Deezer\u2019s UK and Ireland MD, told me that this involves finding new ways to introduce users to the millions of songs in its catalogue, rather than making noise about a specific 12 new tracks.     If Tidal was good enough for Prince, why aren\u2019t we all using it? Photograph: Frank Micelotta/REX/Shutterstock    Last week, he had YouGov in the Deezer office. The organisation was doing research following Deezer\u2019s recent TV ad campaign \u2013 part of the company\u2019s attempt to take streaming to mainstream audiences. The results showed a bump for Tidal\u2019s brand recognition off the back of some of its exclusives. \u201cBut from what we can see there isn\u2019t the same result in terms of revenues,\u201d says Harris, \u201cand Tidal is still a minnow in the world of global music streaming. We don\u2019t regard them as serious competition. The odd exclusive makes for a nice soundbite, but it doesn\u2019t make for a complete service.\u201d I ask Harris if he has listened to the Beyonc\u00e9 album. He hasn\u2019t had a spare minute, he admits. \u201cIf I was going to, personally I\u2019d probably listen for free on Tidal on a trial account,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so bothered about what Beyonc\u00e9 does or doesn\u2019t do on her husband\u2019s platform that I\u2019d rush to do it.\u201d Elsewhere, a music industry source intimately acquainted with the streaming world argues that windowing can actually be damaging to artists. \u201cLet\u2019s look at what happened with Kanye,\u201d they told me. \u201cHe windowed for two months. If you look at his public listener figures since Pablo went on Spotify, you can see he\u2019s had like a 50% jump, from around 15 million monthly listeners to around 22 million. Pablo only hit No 1 when it hit non-exclusive.\u201d As for Beyonc\u00e9? \u201cShe\u2019s No 1 on lots of charts. She\u2019s No 1 on The Pirate Bay, she\u2019s No 1 on KickAss Torrents \u2026\u201d While it\u2019s true that social media timelines are full of Beyonc\u00e9 fans grudgingly signing up to Tidal, it appears that exclusives are tempting others into piracy. One way to warn artists away from windowing might be for the biggest streaming services, such as Spotify, to pull down the shutters on artists who have windowed elsewhere. For them to say: \u201cActually, you know what, you\u2019ve got your lump sum of cash from Apple Music for keeping your album off our service for a week \u2013 we\u2019ll give it a miss thanks.\u201d Over at Spotify, Jonathan Prince, the company\u2019s global head of communications and public policy, does not think that is likely. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of getting offended,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t take it personally. We want all these people on the service because their fans want to listen to them, but we get that artists make decisions for all sorts of different reasons: business-related, philosophical, whatever. They\u2019re creating great work and they\u2019ve got a right to make their own decisions.\u201d And what of Tidal\u2019s claim to pay artists \u201cproperly\u201d, while other services allegedly do not? \u201cIn order to really understand the value being created, we need to move away from this antiquated notion of per stream or per listen,\u201d Prince begins. \u201cWe need to measure success based on the value of the consumer, not the value of the individual transaction. If a consumer\u2019s paying $120 a year to listen to music, that\u2019s much more than what the average consumer was worth at the height of the music industry. And it\u2019s why the industry is finally growing again.\u201d Rather more bluntly, he adds: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got one user listening to one song a month, you can say \u2018We pay $10 a stream\u2019, but you\u2019ve still only got one user, so it\u2019s like, big freaking deal.\u201d It may even be the case that being \u201cthe artist\u2019s friend\u201d is an unsustainable business model for Tidal. \u201cSo far,\u201d Tim Ingham points out, \u201cthe bigger independent streaming services get, the bigger their losses become. That gamble especially applies for any platform arbitrarily promising artists a higher royalty rate than Spotify, a company which has shattered its bottom line to pay music rights holders the most it possibly can.\u201d     Kanye West, who released his album The Life of Pablo exclusively on Tidal. Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images    Perhaps, however, it was never the plan for Tidal to rival huge services such as Spotify. Maybe Jay Z really was incredibly naive when he thought a combination of star power and the tech world\u2019s equivalent of loose change would make a streaming service work. But does Jay Z strike you as a particularly naive guy? One line of thought is that he was playing a different game from the beginning. Ingham spells it out. \u201cJay Z is a thoroughbred businessman,\u201d he says. \u201cHe likes making money. You might have noticed he talks about it quite a lot. Tidal can\u2019t win the streaming wars, but it can cause a racket, get bought by a real player and ensure Jay Z and his fellow superstar shareholders are paid handsomely in the process. I suspect Tidal\u2019s celebrity harem have had this laid out for them: \u2018Back us, and when we sell, you\u2019ll get paid big.\u2019\u201d Matthew Hussey predicts Tidal will end up being bought out by Samsung, a company that has watched its closest rivals in the handset world \u2013 Apple and Android \u2013 build platforms and revenue streams with their own streaming services. Considering the media narrative on Tidal, this would be the ultimate plot twist. If Jay Z does, indeed, flip Tidal and make himself a billionaire in the process, Tidal could be the smartest financial move of his career.",
