  "body": "You\u2019d think from the title of Sara Pascoe\u2019s new standup set that this is the show of her just-released \u201cautobiography of the female body\u201d, Animal. In fact, feminism and biology are relatively low in the mix of an hour that instead addresses the question: what does it mean to be a good person? It\u2019s a flighty offering even by Pascoe\u2019s digressive standards, and packs a slightly weaker punch than her earlier shows about pair bonding and (after a fashion) Nietzschean philosophy. But it\u2019s still great fun, full of fresh, honest and lovably artless thinking about love, sex and modern living.   Related: Sara Pascoe: \u2018My mum has heckled me\u2019    In this disquisition on empathy, or the lack of it, Pascoe is her own No 1 case study. To begin with, we\u2019re regaled with tales of teenage misdemeanours, and of manipulative behaviour in her current relationship, that show how \u201cgross\u201d she is. She\u2019s adept at telling stories against herself; her awkward body language \u2013 as reticent as her words are revealing \u2013 really brings the self-abasement to life. Mind you, that gawky physical presence is in some ways a trick, there to soften the sharpness and authority of her judgments on (to give one example) the TV show RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. The drag queens featured could never pass as real women, she argues, because they\u2019re too at ease in their own skins. Not for the first time, the material on gender brings out Pascoe\u2019s best. There\u2019s a routine lamenting the fall from grace of female pubic hair, and in another she devises a novel corrective to the ubiquity of online porn. The malign effect of street lamps on the glow-worm population is spun into a plangent metaphor for our 21st-century sex lives, as modern man is trained to favour a shinier, more plasticky variant on womankind at the expense of the real thing. None of this remotely resembles a lecture \u2013 but just in case, Pascoe inserts a self-mocking line in each instance suggesting that it may not be the culture that\u2019s at fault, but her reaction to it.      My main caveat with the set is that Pascoe\u2019s so light on her feet here, so quick to move on from any joke or set-piece, that I sometimes felt frustrated. One skit about God appearing to her in a supermarket digresses before ever showing its hand. A line about Pascoe\u2019s theory of the death of socialism devolves into a routine about her favourite TV shows \u2013 and the theory is never fleshed out. I\u2019m not asking for a treatise, and I readily acknowledge that Pascoe\u2019s tangential way of thinking is key to her considerable charm. But on this occasion, the pleasure of chasing to keep up is tinged with regret that this or that topic has been cast aside too soon. That\u2019s only a regret because Pascoe is such a terrific comic: it\u2019s so much fun to watch her really wrestle a question to the ground. Here, notwithstanding a choice routine about her poor handjob technique deriving from \u201cempathy failure\u201d, Pascoe\u2019s how-to-be-good theme doesn\u2019t forcibly assert itself. But, from one digression to the next, she remains very endearing company, effortlessly adept at making us think and laugh.  At Soho theatre, London, until 28 May. Box office: 020-7478 0100. Then touring.",
