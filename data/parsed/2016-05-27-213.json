  "body": "Four mummified M\u0101ori heads have been returned to New Zealand as part of the second-largest repatriation of indigenous remains in the country\u2019s history. Following five years of negotiations, the Smithsonian Institution in the US agreed to return the objects, made up of the remains of at least 54 M\u0101ori and Moriori individuals. Descendants of the people whom the remains belong to were at Te Papa museum in Wellington to extend a powhiri, a traditional M\u0101ori welcome.

Photograph: Robert Pratta/Reuters    Haami Piripi, a M\u0101ori elder and member of the repatriation team, said the return of the remains has helped to unite disparate M\u0101ori tribes across the country, some of whom had historically been at odds. \u201cToday one of the people being returned was one of my own ancestors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really a joyful occasion. It is meant to be grieving and mournful, but it is joyful. Our ancestors were whisked away in dubious circumstances centuries ago, and they are finally returning home, after a very long journey.\u201d As part of the repatriation effort, the remains of a further six individuals were returned from the UK and other US museums. Among them was a M\u0101ori child\u2019s skull from Beneski Museum in Massachusetts. \u201cOver 300 Toi moko [tattooed, preserved M\u0101ori heads] have been returned to New Zealand in the last two decades, and I have looked everyone in the face,\u201d said Piripi. \u201cI look at their moko [facial tattoos] and think \u2018I am sure I know you from somewhere\u2019. And that really says it all. Five or six generations on, those links remain. They are family.\u201d The New Zealand government\u2019s indigenous repatriation programme has secured the return of the remains of about 400 individuals since it was set up in 1990.  Piripi said the team\u2019s research indicates there are about another 600 M\u0101ori remains stored in institutions around the world, and potentially hundreds more \u201cin attics in private homes in Europe, forgotten about\u201d.     Descendants of the people whom the remains belong to were at Te Papa museum in Wellington on Friday. Photograph: Kate Whitley/Te Papa    Dr Arapata Hakiwai, a M\u0101ori co-leader at Te Papa, said the remains would be stored in a wahi tapu \u2013 or sacred place \u2013 within the musuem, and, if possible, returned to the tribes around the country to which they belong for burial. Hakiwai has been on several overseas expeditions to repatriate Toi moko, and said it was an experience always tinged with sadness.  \u201cWhen I am overseas, and I face a Toi moko, I speak to them,\u201d he said. \u201cI say: \u2018Look, I\u2019ve come here to see you. I know you\u2019re an ancestor, who lived amongst the mountains and the rivers. I want to take you home, to rest among your land and your people. In the M\u0101ori world, you still live.\u2019\u201d Hakiwai said the numbers of repatriated M\u0101ori remains would soon become too much for Te Papa to store. He said the museum was working on identifying a national resting place for remains that have not been returned to tribal lands.",
