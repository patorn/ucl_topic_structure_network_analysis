  "body": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez says there is a good chance he will still be in charge of Newcastle United next season but his future at the relegated Tynesiders hinges on two factors: the outcome of talks with Mike Ashley this coming week and a potential approach from Everton. Although the latter seems unlikely, the former Liverpool manager\u2019s family home is on the Wirral and it is understood he could be open to talking to Goodison Park officials about succeeding Roberto Mart\u00ednez.   Related: Sunderland fans plan \u2018Auf wiedersehen Prem\u2019 plane taunt of Newcastle    Were that to happen, Ben\u00edtez \u2013 whose team host Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday \u2013 would not walk away from Newcastle lightly. He is in discussions with the board about not activating the break clause in his three-year contract in order to conduct wholesale reform of the club before leading them back into the Premier League at the first attempt. So far the negotiations, which could take a fortnight to conclude, have been led by Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director, with the Spaniard delaying a meeting with Ashley that the owner had proposed for last week until the next few days. No previous Newcastle manager would have kept the sports retail tycoon waiting, but much as Ben\u00edtez \u2013 who has not spoken to Ashley since succeeding Steve McClaren \u2013 is taken with the club, he holds the upper hand and knows it. \u201cMike Ashley\u2019s keen to talk and I\u2019m really pleased we can sit down together,\u201d said the 56-year-old who, despite failing to avoid relegation, has impressed at St James\u2019 during his two-month tenure. \u201cMike Ashley told Lee Charnley that maybe he could talk with me last week but I said: \u2018Listen, we cannot say too much so I think it\u2019s better if we wait.\u2019 The message Mike Ashley is sending is quite positive, but it was better to talk after we play Tottenham.\u201d Ben\u00edtez will ask Ashley for written assurances over his transfer budget, control of transfers and other spheres of club autonomy, but can also reassure the owner that the prospect of managing in the second tier holds few fears for him. \u201cI was promoted twice in Spain, at Extremadura and Tenerife,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the Championship or the Premier League a coach\u2019s job doesn\u2019t change too much. Winning trophies around the world and being in the Champions League is what you\u2019re looking for, but I\u2019ve already done these things. I decided to come here because I knew it could be a big challenge and could also be really important for my future.\u201d By that he means the chance to spend much more time with his wife and two teenage daughters than was possible during previous stints in charge of Napoli and Real Madrid. \u201cFamily life is really important to me and here I\u2019m close to them,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, who is virtually certain to reject approaches from Valencia and another Spanish club. \u201cI like the idea of staying. I\u2019m really happy and flattered with the support I\u2019ve had. It\u2019s been amazing, fantastic. \u201cI can still see the potential here. It\u2019s a massive club. If I stay, my target is to have one year in the Championship and five in the Premier League. \u201cWhat can make the difference about my decision is that we have a strong team to promote in the first year. It\u2019s a good chance [I\u2019ll stay] but it\u2019s a question of having a structure that can help the club go up next year and then be strong and competitive in the Premier League. It depends on the conversation but I think that a couple of weeks, maximum, could be a decent time for a decision.\u201d",
