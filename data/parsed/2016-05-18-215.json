  "body": "Everyone knows the Ghostbusters ain\u2019t afraid of no ghosts. But it appears marketing executives might be more than a little nervous about showing the all-female quartet for Paul Feig\u2019s forthcoming remake on toy packaging. In photos of merchandise tie-ins for the film, the fearsome foursome of Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon appear to have been spirited away.    GHOSTBUSTERS has a cast of four women. The toy proton pack? No girls allowed, I guess. pic.twitter.com/2Ygn6qK373\u2014 Chuck Wendig (@ChuckWendig) May 13, 2016    Mattel, it should be noted, have created figurines of the female quartet. Ghostbusters opens in US and UK on 15 July. In addition to criticism over its female leads, Feig\u2019s movie has been caught up in controversies about the casting of the African American comic Jones as a supposedly stereotypical \u201cstreet-smart New Yorker\u201d.  A trailer for the film is the least-liked in YouTube history.",
