  "body": "The government would have greeted the release of the pre-election fiscal and economic outlook on Friday with a sigh of relief as the budget deficits were essentially unchanged. But the numbers in the Pefo and the commentary by the heads of the Treasury and the Department of Finance provide a tough question for the government  \u2013 for all the talk of a plan for jobs and growth, where are the signs of either?  The Pefo ended up being released a bit earlier than needed. The Treasury and Department of Finance had 10 days from the issuing of writs last Monday; instead it was released it within four days. Releasing so early meant the departments didn\u2019t need to consider the record low wages growth figures released last week. And because the Treasury makes its assumptions on commodity prices \u2013 such as iron ore \u2013 on \u201can average of the preceding weeks\u201d there would be little changed from the budget even with the recent sharp fall in iron ore prices.

You\u2019d have to work pretty hard to suggest an extra $2m was a blowout. But the Pefo doesn\u2019t exactly paint a wonderful a tale about the economy.  It notes for example that there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the forecasts for real GDP growth if the pick-up in non-mining investment, which has been \u201cslower to materialise than previously forecast\u201d suffered further delays or was \u201cslower than currently estimated\u201d. The budget (and Pefo) estimate that non-mining investment for 2016-17 will grow by 3.5%. Such hope is yet to be supported by a great deal of evidence. The first estimate for non-mining capital expenditure for 2016-17 showed a fall of 1.1% from the first estimate for 2015-16:       The Pefo also continues to use budget figures for employment growth, which actually suggest things are about to get pretty bad for those looking for work.  While the Pefo notes that \u201cemployment growth is expected to remain solid across the forward estimate\u201d, that \u201csolid\u201d growth is just 1.75% in 2016-17 and 2017-18 before falling to 1.25% in 2018-19, and then improving to a tepid 1.5% in 2019-20.

Given wage growth at the moment is just 2% and the outlook for inflation from the Reserve Bank of Australia is much weaker than historically has been the case, it would be rather odd for wages to rise in a period of weaker employment growth. And the problem is that weak employment growth is already with us. The latest labour force figures released on Thursday showed that annual employment growth is now just 2% \u2013 down from a high of 2.6% in December. More worrying though is that the growth in hours worked has fallen off a cliff:       At the end of last year the level of hours worked was growing by 2.6% \u2013 the strongest growth since February 2011. Now it is growing by just 0.4%; without a quick turnaround it will soon be going backwards \u2013 generally the sign of recessionary conditions.  Among the reasons is that full-time employment has slowed considerably \u2013 especially for men:       This is part of the ongoing issue since the global financial crisis where part-time employment has been the big driver of employment growth:       Since September 2008 \u2013 when the financial crisis started hitting employment \u2013 there have been 235,400 more part-time jobs created than full-time ones:       While these figures suggest a significant slowing of the employment sector, the government has been largely spared any great pain because the unemployment rate has stayed steady at 5.7%:       And yet the past few months has certainly been a case of the unemployment rate hiding the bad news in the sector.  Since December the participation rate has fallen from 65.2% in seasonally adjusted terms to 64.9%.       A dropping participation rate is a function of more people leaving the workforce than entering it. This can be because of people retiring or because they have effectively given up looking for work \u2013 either to stay home raising kids or to stay in (or go back to) school/higher education. In the past six months the fall in participation has been across the board \u2013 both youth (15-24 year olds) and prime-aged workers (25-64 year olds) \u2013 suggesting it is not really an ageing population issue. Had the participation rate stayed where it was in November the unemployment rate would not have fallen as it has since then. Rather than being 5.7% it would be 6.1%:       That doesn\u2019t mean the current unemployment rate is false, but just that, as ever, it is hostage to other aspects which can hide the weakness in the economy. Similarly the Pefo budget numbers hide the weakness that is clear within the actual report itself. The Pefo notes that \u201cthe medium-term projections are also underpinned by an assumption of annual productivity growth equal to the average of recent decades\u201d. That requires productivity growth averaging over five years around 1.7% annually. We\u2019ve been achieving that recently \u2013 but for nearly seven years until 2012 we were well below that level:       Rather interestingly the statement of the secretary of the Treasury and Department of Finance suggests that to achieve this growth \u201ccontinued economic reform would be required\u201d. Just what this \u201creform\u201d would be is left unsaid, but what is clear is that the budget figures, while unchanged in the Pefo, are rather susceptible to being knocked.  Whoever wins the election will be unlikely to be using these numbers by the time the estimates become actual.",
