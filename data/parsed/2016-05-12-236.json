  "body": "Journalism is notorious for its lack of diversity, and recent figures have shown that progress on increasing the number of black and minority ethnic journalists continues to be far too slow. At the same time, women are still under-represented in senior positions, and the Guardian\u2019s recent and ongoing series The Web We Want highlighted some of the abuse facing black contributors and women contributors. Here, four young, black female journalists \u2013 all recipients of the Guardian\u2019s Scott Trust bursary \u2013 discuss what it\u2019s like to be starting their careers in this environment. Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff: Have any of you got particular experiences of online abuse that spring to mind? [silence] CBC: So, you\u2019ve all had only positive experiences? Isabel Togoh: So far. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because I\u2019m not yet writing regularly.   Related: The women abandoned to their online abusers    Aletha Adu: I think it might be to do with the articles we write. At the moment I am not writing anything that is directly race-related or that tackles any racial issues, so I do not think people will find a need to racially abuse me. But when you [directed to Brinkhurst-Cuff] write articles for the Guardian that tackle racial issues, you get people that are like, \u201cUgh, shut up!\u201d or who feel as though they\u2019re tired of hearing our thoughts and feelings. That\u2019s definitely a shame. CBC: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019ve had all sorts of things written at the bottom of my articles and articles I\u2019ve edited by black women. Recently on gal-dem, a magazine written by women of colour that I help to edit, I\u2019ve seen some horrifically racist things. Personally I\u2019ve been racially abused, undermined, told I\u2019m stupid and ignorant. But, weirdly, because my name \u2013 Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff \u2013 sounds like a posh white man\u2019s name, sometimes they attack me by saying, \u201cWho does this posh guy think he is, commenting on the working-class struggle?\u201d It\u2019s just my parents\u2019 surnames put together \u2013 chill! And I\u2019m a woman! Emmanuella Kwenortey: Racist or anti-feminist comments are nearly always underneath articles that discuss these subjects. It\u2019s one of the reasons I work for Skin Deep magazine: it\u2019s a place where race and culture can be discussed at length without asinine attacks. It\u2019s no secret that hate comments stop prospective journalists of colour from talking about issues they really care about. But when we do, there\u2019s a fear that we\u2019ll be labelled as the journalist-who-only-talks-about-race \u2013 a sort of one-trick pony. But we can discuss the topic through a non-white lens, and it\u2019s one of the ways we stand out. CBC: We\u2019ve been doing a series on skin-lightening on gal-dem and that provoked some very angry reactions. AA: Yeah, I saw this one in the comments section on gal-dem. They talked about monkeys and apes, and said: \u201cThen go buy fucking African products to make your skin darker ... Go back to Africa and build your grass fucking hut and shut the fuck up about the civilised, white, western world.\u201d    On Mail Online you see a racist comment, and it will have 122 likes, and three dislikes    EK: Here\u2019s another. The commenter said: \u201cNo amount of skin-whitener can fix Naomi Mbonga\u2019s [referring to Naomi Campbell] face. I recommend an axe.\u201d CBC: Does it not scare you that there are people who think like this walking around? EK: It doesn\u2019t scare or surprise me. CBC: Really? EK: It doesn\u2019t scare me because I don\u2019t feel isolated. I live in London, it\u2019s incredibly ethnically diverse. At the same time, growing up in the capital did lull me into a false understanding of the UK\u2019s ethnic make-up. Going to university outside the city helped me realise, again, that the UK is predominantly white and London anomalous in regards to ethnic plurality. IT: Whenever I read Mail Online, I\u2019ll make a point to click on a Lupita Nyong\u2019o or Beyonc\u00e9 article just to see what the commenters are saying. You see a racist comment, and it will have 122 likes, and three dislikes. I can\u2019t think of a particularly vitriolic example, but they will question their talent or the extent to which they deserve their success. I think we should tackle this head on. Sometimes if we get angry online, we\u2019re accused of being as bad as the trolls and racists. But to me, it\u2019s not about meeting fire with fire, it\u2019s about saying: \u201cMy voice is absolutely valid.\u201d AA: Yes, exactly! But I think we need to explore and make use of the many different ways we can make ourselves heard. Particularly because black females are stereotyped as being \u201cloud\u201d, \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cbrash\u201d. We need to keep writing about issues we feel passionate about. CBC: It\u2019s just so hard, though. Sometimes I feel like, why should I have to tackle these racists online again and again and again? I\u2019ve been doing it since I was 14! I used to go on to these National Front forums on Bebo and have raging arguments with these men \u2013 or boys, who knows \u2013 to try to convince them that their views about black people were wrong. It\u2019s tiring. IT: It is exhausting, and not everyone is equipped to \u2013 or wants to \u2013 fight back. CBC: Why do you think it\u2019s so bad online? EK: People are much braver online than in the flesh. I always wonder, when I see the comments: would you say this to my face? AA: Well, they would not need to thanks to social media. People do not have to have discussions or arguments with people face to face, they will just let it all out on the first thing they see, whether it is an article or a music video. CBC: When you guys were growing up, didn\u2019t you experience overt racism? All: Yes. EK: I remember a girl saying: \u201cYou\u2019re dirty.\u201d I was seven. Four years later, this girl got really into hip-hop, really into grime, started to cane row her hair. I remember looking at her thinking, \u201cYou have got to be kidding me.\u201d It was just another example of someone loving black culture but not black people. Such a tired cliche.   Related: The dark side of Guardian comments    CBC: In my school in London there were a lot of black kids, and only two white kids in my class. When we painted our noses for red nose day, a white kid said: \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, your skin is too dark to do that,\u201d and everyone called him out as being racist. But when I moved to Scotland, where it was super-white, I had to explain, even to my close friends, why it was not OK to use the word \u201cPaki\u201d. I was called a \u201cblack bin bag\u201d and the N-word on a couple of occasions, too. IT: I was five when I moved to Kent. The racism was implicit; a kind of aggressive curiosity. Occasionally, there were disparaging comments, like in year four, I had cornrows in my hair, and this boy told me I looked like the footballer, [Nwankwo] Kanu. CBC: I had exactly the same insult! I had exactly the same insult and I took out my cornrows because of it! IT: But at the time, he was probably the most prominent black person they knew, so they banded us together. It has affected us to the point where we still remember it, today. CBC: Yeah \u2013 and I\u2019d never wear my hair like that again. EK: But just as people say racist things in \u201creal life\u201d as well as online, I think it is wrong to focus only on what commenters say about articles without looking at the problems in the media industry itself. City University recently published data on the ethnicity of journalists within the UK: 94% are white, even though only 87% of the UK workforce overall is white; 40% of journalists are based in London, but London is more non-white British than it is white British. The discrepancies are clear.    Anyone who disagrees with positive discrimination schemes \u2013 just look inside the newsroom and see why they\u2019re important    IT: One way to fix this is to put more of us in actual newsrooms. AA: It will take longer to see us in senior editorial roles, no doubt. But if the likes of Joseph Harker and Kamal Ahmed are excelling, it really is possible! IT: Kath Viner [the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief] made a strong point in her Vogue interview in saying that she \u201cbulldozed\u201d her way through as a woman in an industry dominated by male editors. Although our journey as black women in journalism is bound to be more challenging, I think we\u2019re going to have to bulldoze too, and develop a thick skin. There are going to be obstacles but we have to be assertive, without compromising who we are. EK: I think it\u2019s about being unapologetic. CBC: Newsrooms are very, very, very white. Incredibly white. Anyone who disagrees with positive discrimination schemes, they just need to look inside the newsroom and see why they\u2019re important. And the whiteness impacts on the coverage. I was on the news desk at a rightwing national newspaper when the story of Alice Gross broke, before her body was found. The news editor came over to the desk and said: \u201cThis girl is white, she is young, she is pretty, she\u2019s middle class, she\u2019s done a creative writing course, she\u2019s perfect, our readers will love her, let\u2019s get on this, guys,\u201d and I was just sitting there thinking, \u201cDid he just say that?\u201d EK: I imagine the editor believed that, to their readers, Alice was their daughter. CBC: But do you not think that\u2019s messed up? I understand why he did it, but do you not think that nothing\u2019s going to change if that is the attitude of people in power? IT: That\u2019s the way the news agenda is set, because that\u2019s how they see the world, that\u2019s their viewpoint. I remember when ITV broadcaster Charlene White didn\u2019t wear a poppy and she got a whole load of vitriol attacking her as a black woman. Some attackers went for the \u201cyou don\u2019t belong in this country\u201d line, and Lola Okolosie wrote this piece saying that that\u2019s why black female journalists don\u2019t put their heads above the parapet: because often we are not seen for our views, but purely for our identity. EK: It\u2019s as if black journalists can\u2019t take what readers see as liberties. They\u2019ll take \u201cshit\u201d from a white journalist but not from a journalist of colour. AA: Many of the black people I know don\u2019t even bother talking about racism any more. First, I do think it\u2019s because overt racism is not the same as it was a few years ago. But ultimately they feel that, if someone\u2019s being racist in person, they can deal with it. But institutional racism could be here for the long-haul and might have to be an issue they help their own children deal with. EK: A lot of people just want to get on with their lives. My dad has lived in the same house in the UK for 50 years but still considers Ghana his home, though both he and my mum love it here. Still, they feel as if they don\u2019t have the right to challenge the status quo. CBC: Do you think that might become part of our journalistic careers \u2013 being that voice for people who are disenfranchised or unable to vocalise the prejudice they\u2019re subjected to? EK: Figures such as Tupac and Kanye said they never wanted to be role models, or speak for the black community \u2013 but they\u2019re aspirational figures, so undoubtedly people look to them. Sometimes you have to embrace the role, whether you want it or not. IT: Hopefully the conversation will be different in 10 years\u2019 time. We are not one-dimensional and therefore should not be expected to only write race think-pieces every now and then, although this is incredibly important and necessary. AA: We are capable of being visible news reporters, feature writers, columnists. Journalists! EK: Like Chinua Achebe said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like someone\u2019s story, write your own.\u201d",
