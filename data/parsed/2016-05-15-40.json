  "body": "Lewis Hamilton was blamed by his boss Niki Lauda for the first-lap accident that put both the Briton and his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg out of the Spanish Grand Prix as the teenager Max Verstappen became the youngest race winner. Race stewards later dismissed the crash as a racing incident yet Lauda, Mercedes\u2019 non-executive chairman, was in no doubt about who was the guilty party. \u201cIt is stupid, we could\u2019ve won this race,\u201d Lauda said. \u201cLewis is too aggressive. I need to talk to them and hear their explanation and then we will see what happens.\u201d However, after speaking to both drivers Toto Wolff, the team\u2019s head of motorsport, said he would be taking no action. The double retirement was \u201clesson enough\u201d, he said. \u201cBy continuing with the approach of letting them race it was clear that eventually this could happen. And we will continue to let them race.   Related: Mercedes inquest after Hamilton and Rosberg crash out of F1 Spanish Grand Prix    \u201cToday was just a couple of unfortunate coincidences that ended up in us losing as a team. It\u2019s painful for them to see that we have lost what could\u2019ve been a great result,\u201d Wolff added. \u201cWhat I said to the two of them is that fundamentally they are sitting in the cars. They are responsible for bringing those cars home and they failed to bring those cars home today. And I don\u2019t want to go any further.\u201d Remarkably it was the first crash between the only two drivers competing for the world championship since the Belgian Grand Prix two years ago. But Wolff said: \u201cWe have moved on from Spa in 2014 and it was a completely different situation in the team back then.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the drivers had differing views. Hamilton said: \u201cFirstly, I have already apologised to the team. That\u2019s the most gutting thing when I stopped. Thinking about all these guys. To not deliver for those guys. \u201c I saw a gap and I went for it and that\u2019s what racing drivers do. I went for it. I got there and had part of my wing and wheel alongside. The gap diminished pretty quickly. \u201cI did what I could to avoid an incident by going on the grass. It all went pretty quickly.\u201d He added: \u201cYou make a calculation in a split-second decision. You never go to the outside, it\u2019s not where you want to overtake. The gap is one car width. The inside is two car widths. So I went for that one.\u201d   Related: Max Verstappen becomes youngest F1 winner in history at Spanish Grand Prix    Rosberg said he had been surprised at Hamilton\u2019s attempt to pass him. \u201cI saw Lewis closing in and I moved to the inside, closing the door to make sure Lewis knew there wasn\u2019t going to be any space there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he went for it anyway, so I was really surprised. In hindsight, I was surprised he went for that inside gap. In the end we have to go with what the experts think and they think it was a racing incident.\u201d Allan McNish, the BBC Radio 5 analyst, got it right when he described the incident as \u201ca little bit of a misunderstanding\u201d. He said: \u201cIt was very robust from both drivers.\u201d \u201cRosberg was moving over to defend the corner - it was two guys going for the same piece of tarmac, but the big loser out of this is Lewis Hamilton.\u201d The stewards also came to a reasonable view. In their verdict they concluded: \u201cHaving heard extensively from both drivers and from the team, the stewards determined that Car 6 [Rosberg] had the right to make the manoeuvre that he did and that Car 44\u2019s [Hamilton] attempt to overtake was reasonable, and that the convergence of events led neither driver to be wholly or predominantly at fault.\u201d Having been involved in his fair share of collisions during his career that saw him win four drivers\u2019 championships, the wise Alain Prost just gave a Gallic shrug and said: \u201cRacing incident.\u201d",
