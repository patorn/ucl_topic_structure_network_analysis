  "body": "Only 12 months ago, Marc Warren harboured aspirations of a Ryder Cup debut at Hazeltine in September. It endorses how competitive \u2013 and fragile \u2013 golf is that the Scot has vanished so quickly from the picture. Starting the Irish Open week, Warren had slipped to 132nd in the world. It is a ludicrous ranking in respect of the 35-year-old\u2019s talent. Warren\u2019s lack of form and placing outside the top 50 means his Ryder Cup climb is a steep one now. Victory at the K Club would help. Warren\u2019s second round of 66 moved him to eight under par and, suddenly, a part of the discussion once more. \u201cI felt, especially in the last three events, two in China and one in Spain, as if I was close to some decent form,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut the schedule this year feels as if I\u2019ve been stop, start a lot; not top 50 in the world and not into the events in America to fill in some of the downtime we have on the European Tour. I feel I was more rusty than anything else. \u201cI have been searching, working hard for it, and hopefully the time is right coming into some great events this year starting with the Irish Open. Hopefully it\u2019s the start of a run of good form. \u201cI think it\u2019s been there or thereabouts. The cuts I\u2019ve made haven\u2019t been that great and the cuts I\u2019ve missed haven\u2019t been too bad. You\u2019re going to go through spells like that over the course of a season or over the course of two or three seasons. It\u2019s a matter of trying to be as patient as you possibly can.\u201d   Related: Justin Rose out of PGA Championship at Wentworth with back injury    On a damp, blustery morning in Kildare, Warren required only 23 putts. He made bogey at a single hole, the 5th. \u201cI think being pretty solid off the tee was the key to the round,\u201d he said. \u201cI kept it in play and from there was able to hit some good iron shots into the greens. Anything under 70 would have been a really good score this morning, so pleased with 66.\u201d Warren\u2019s 36-hole score matched that of the Masters champion Danny Willett, who added a \u201cscrappy\u201d 71 to his opening round 65. Willett recovered from the making of four bogeys. Rory McIlroy\u2019s 70 leaves the tournament host a stroke further back. It is hardly being disrespectful to Warren to suggest onlookers will relish a weekend battle between McIlroy and Willett. McIlroy agreed before offering a smile when glancing back towards his poor record in his home event. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Danny up there,\u201d he said. \u201cI was very pleased he committed to come and play here. It\u2019s shaping up to be a good weekend. Any time you have a current major champion up there near the top of the leaderboard, it always makes it better. With my tournament hat on, I\u2019m happy with how it\u2019s going. \u201cI usually don\u2019t stand up here after a second day and say I\u2019m relieved to make the cut but it\u2019s great to be here for the weekend. But I\u2019m obviously even more excited that I\u2019m in with a chance of winning the tournament. The Irish Open is one of the most important tournaments of my year and I\u2019d dearly love to win it one day. I feel like I\u2019ve given myself a great chance. \u201cI think the only way I can convert this one is by trying to approach it the same way. Trying to stay as patient as I possibly can. The weather doesn\u2019t look too good, so we\u2019re going to have to battle not just the course and myself, but also the conditions.\u201d Andy Sullivan\u2019s surprisingly poor recent run continued with a missed cut at six over par.",
