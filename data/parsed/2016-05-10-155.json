  "body": "The winner: sunshine The first gloriously sunny weekend of the year had a predictable impact on the UK box office, with takings declining 54% from the previous frame. Pretty much everything fell by at least 60%, a rare exception being Secret Cinema\u2019s run of 28 Days Later, which held steady, and benefits from audiences typically having long ago booked tickets.    Related: Cannes 2016: festival previewed and X-Men: Apocalypse reviewed \u2013 the Dailies film podcast    Despite strong reviews and warm word of mouth (8.5/10 at IMDb), Captain America: Civil War saw takings fall by 67%. Embarrassingly, that\u2019s only marginally better than the 68% drop experienced by Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in its second session. Box office stands at \u00a327.4m after 10 days, which compares with \u00a327.8m at the same stage for the DC Comics rival.  Marvel will now be hoping to arrest the fall, ultimately overtaking Batman v Superman\u2019s total of \u00a336.6m. Whatever happens, Civil War is heading for a lifetime tally far in excess of any previous Captain America film \u2013 The First Avenger managed only \u00a310.4m in the UK, while sequel The Winter Soldier reached \u00a319.3m. The comedy sequel: Bad Neighbours 2           Seth Rogen: \u2018There are probably jokes in Superbad bordering on the blatantly homophobic\u2019 \u2013 video interview    When Bad Neighbours landed in the box-office chart in May 2014, it did so with a splashy \u00a38.45m \u2013 a stunning debut for a relatively low-budget comedy. On closer inspection, that number included a whopping six days of previews, responsible for \u00a35.16m of the opening gross. Still, the three-day weekend debut of \u00a33.29m was not so shabby. Now Bad Neighbours 2 arrives, opening with \u00a31.69m, and no previews. That\u2019s only 51% of the opening weekend box office achieved by Bad Neighbours over the same period.  Comedy sequels often present studios with commercial challenges. Warners powered The Hangover: Part II to \u00a332.8m in the UK \u2013 well up on The Hangover\u2019s already impressive \u00a322.1m. The studio had the freedom to send the guys off to Thailand in that film \u2013 whereas Bad Neighbours\u2019 specific location limits options. Some comedy films lend themselves to sequelisation more readily than others, especially when rooted in a strong group of characters (for example, The Inbetweeners). Bad Neighbours offered a marketable high concept \u2013 hard-partying students next door \u2013 but not necessarily one that audiences needed to see twice. The upscale comedy: Florence Foster Jenkins           Stephen Frears on Florence Foster Jenkins: \u2018Killed by critics! A feeling I know well\u2019    While Bad Neighbours 2 failed to reach the commercial heights of its predecessor, you could argue that a UK opening of \u00a31.69m is not so bad for a Hollywood comedy. It\u2019s also more than double the debut of rival new release Florence Foster Jenkins \u2013 and at 76 fewer cinemas (490 against 556). Florence, starring Meryl Streep, Hugh Grant and Big Bang Theory\u2019s Simon Helberg, begins with \u00a3713,000, including previews of \u00a3130,000. Strip out the previews, and the site average is a poor \u00a31,049. Among all sectors of the UK cinema audience, it\u2019s generally accepted that older, upscale viewers are most reluctant to abandon weekend garden sunshine. This audience is also more apt to visit a cinema midweek, and is generally slower to see films. For all those reasons, Pathe and distribution partner Fox have every reason to hope that Florence Foster Jenkins will pick up after this disappointing start. The flop: I Saw the Light           Tom Hiddleston sings Hank Williams in a London guitar shop \u2013 video interview    Landing rather humiliatingly in 20th place is Hank Williams biopic I Saw the Light, with feeble takings of \u00a317,200 from 107 cinemas, yielding a \u00a3161 average. Tom Hiddleston recently helped power Ben Wheatley\u2019s High-Rise to \u00a31.94m in the UK, and has a strong following on social media, but no actor can deliver box office for a film that audiences do not have a particular wish to see. I Saw the Light is the kind of film that would have required decent critical support, but a MetaCritic score of 47/100 tells an unhappy story. On top of that, it\u2019s a title that might have played better in independent cinemas and boutique chains such as Picturehouse and Everyman, but support there has been limited. The 2016 winner: The Jungle Book           Jon Favreau: \u2018Whenever I hear Garry Shandling\u2019s voice in The Jungle Book, it\u2019s sobering\u2019    Disney\u2019s The Jungle Book has added another \u00a36.6m in the past seven days, pushing its tally to \u00a336.8m. That takes it past Batman v Superman (\u00a336.6m), and positions it breathing down the neck of Deadpool (\u00a337.9m). The Jungle Book should overtake Deadpool this week, thereby becoming the top-grossing film of 2016 so far. Captain America: Civil War might also mount a challenge, if its current rate of decline becomes less precipitous. The future   Related: The Angry Birds Movie review \u2013 game spin-off that doesn't quite reach Lego Movie levels    Despite grosses falling 54% from the previous frame, takings are nevertheless 18% up on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when Spooks: The Greater Good and The Age of Adaline were the top new releases. A year ago, the picture then improved with the mid-May arrival of Pitch Perfect 2 and Mad Max: Fury Road. It\u2019s hard to imagine any of this weekend\u2019s new releases having a similar impact, although Sony Animation\u2019s Angry Birds could deliver a surprise. Competing for adult audiences are John le Carr\u00e9 adaptation Our Kind of Traitor, Richard Linklater\u2019s campus-set Everybody Wants Some, Tina Fey Afghan war comedy Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, supernatural horror The Darkness, and bloody US indie thriller Green Room. Arthouse alternatives include the well-regarded Mustang. Top 10 films, 6-8 May 1. Captain America: Civil War, \u00a34,806,575 from 605 sites. Total: \u00a327,372,9222.
