  "body": "Whenever I hear the phrase \u201ccreative industries\u201d I\u2019m always surprised. I ask myself, are there any uncreative industries? If so, how do they survive? Why aren\u2019t they in a museum, next to the dodo? The world is changing at such a blistering pace that businesses without creativity at their core are doomed.  Innovate or die is not just a slogan, it\u2019s a vital truth. Creativity is the most powerful competitive advantage a business can have. Companies need to fizz with new ideas and fresh thinking. But there\u2019s a problem \u2013 there just aren\u2019t enough fizzy people around.  We need to do two things to address this. First, we have to debunk the notion popularised by Hollywood that the creative artist is cut from a different cloth than normal folk \u2013 that creativity is something mysterious, elusive and cannot be taught.   Related: 'We must do all we can to value and protect our creative output'     We are not talking about high art, but empowering people to use their imagination. Not everyone can be Mozart, but everyone can sing. I believe everyone is born creative, but it is educated out of us at school, where we are taught literacy and numeracy. Sure, there are classes called writing and art, but what\u2019s really being taught is conformity.  Young children fizz with ideas. But the moment they go to school, they begin to lose the freedom to explore, take risks and experiment.  We spend our childhoods being taught the artificial skill of passing exams. We learn to give teachers what they expect. By the time we get into industry, we have been conditioned to conform. We spend our days in meetings and talk about \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d. But rarely do we step outside it.  The sad truth is that schools were never designed to produce creativity. Not many people are aware of it, but the education systems in the US and many other countries are based on the 19th-century Prussian model. Children were taught to obey, not to challenge or think creatively. That\u2019s why you stand to attention when the teacher walks into the class. It\u2019s why from the US to China, children wear uniforms.  The system worked well for blue-collar workers \u2013 people who clocked in at factories and stood on production lines making things such as automobile engines. But in a world driven by search engines, the system is a busted flush. We must teach creativity at school as a matter of urgency.  One reason Silicon Valley is doing all the invention, I suspect, is because it\u2019s populated by kids who slipped through the net. With the irreverence of youth still in them, they challenge, take risks and don\u2019t care about what people think. As the old Apple ad said: \u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones!\u201d We need more of these rule breakers and sacred-cow slaughterers.  Traditionally, creatives who are promoted into the echelons of leadership have not always fared well. This too must change. We need more creative leaders \u2013 people who are equally business and creatively minded. When it comes to the right and left brain, they need to be able to use both.  Most importantly, we need creative people in the boardroom. Only when they begin to affect change in the boardroom will the world of business become more innovative \u2013 filled with bigger, bolder and exciting ideas.  Who knows, it may even mean the dawn of a new epoch: the creative age for mankind. We all know how urgently it\u2019s needed, now more than ever.
