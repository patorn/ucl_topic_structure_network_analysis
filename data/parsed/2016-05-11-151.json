It\u2019s not made of gold, but it might as well be, given its cult following. \u201cGolden milk\u201d or turmeric latte \u2013 an unlikely combination of nut milk and juiced turmeric root \u2013 is 2016\u2019s drink of choice. In a new report on food trends in the US, Google singled out turmeric\u2019s ascent after searches for the spice increased by 56% from November 2015 to January 2016. And fuelling that rise is its use in lattes: \u201cgolden milk\u201d is among the top online searches associated with the spice. Turmeric lattes are now being sold at cafes from Sydney to San Francisco, and the drink is gaining fans in the UK. At Modern Baker in Summertown, Oxford, sales of turmeric lattes \u2013 listed on the menu as \u201cGolden mylk\u201d (the \u201cy\u201d is health-speak for non-cow milk) now outnumber that of regular lattes. Turmeric lattes routinely feature in reviews for the York outpost of the Filmore & Union restaurant chain. Nama, a vegan restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, has noticed a surge in the turmeric latte\u2019s popularity recently, even though it has sold the drink for nearly two years. A prescient former employee used to whip them up for the staff, and they went down so well that the latte ended up on the menu.      Fresh turmeric root.

At first, it seems an odd concept. Turmeric is mostly known as a curry ingredient that leaves indelible yellow stains on appliances and fingernails. And, save for the aeration and the artistic lashes of cinnamon, the turmeric latte bears little similarity to its caffeinated namesake. But this is one of those trends whose provenance isn\u2019t just Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop website.  After ghee, homemade yoghurt and coconut oil, turmeric is the latest health-food trend to originate from the south Asian pantry, another sign that the Indian subcontinent may be ahead of the hipster curve. Turmeric and milk is a fairly well-entrenched drink in the region\u2019s food culture, where it is considered a restorative. Turmeric is part of Ayurvedic medicine \u2013 a holistic, all-natural approach to health that has been practised for centuries in India \u2013 and a ubiquitous ingredient in curries and rice dishes.      A turmeric latte from Modern Baker    On the south Asian recipe website Khana Pakana, a turmeric-and-milk combination, haldi doodh, is described as a drink women consume to lighten their skin. The spice is believed to help with everything from cancer to a cough, and is often given to children with a fever. The most commonly used recipe calls for turmeric powder mixed with milk and a dash of black pepper, as well as an optional addition of ghee. This history seems to have filtered into the turmeric latte\u2019s current run of success. It is promoted for its health benefits \u2013 as an anti-inflammatory and an alternative to a caffeinated drink \u2013 and, Arango says, it is particularly popular with customers in the mornings. Modern Baker also makes one with an espresso shot, and an iced version. Like many trends, the turmeric latte may seem to have come out of nowhere. But it has been brewing for a while. The market research firm Mintel named turmeric as one of its foods to watch in 2016. It has done the rounds of the wellness circuit \u2013 the blogs, websites and Instagram accounts of \u201cclean eating\u201d advocates \u2013 for several months, and recipes for the drink abound on Pinterest.

And I did the research, and it was the most delicious thing,\u201d she says. Modern Baker is firmly on the turmeric bandwagon, using the spice in about two dozen products, including turmeric biscuits. Despite being recommended haldi doodh several times in Karachi, Pakistan, where I live, I\u2019ve never come around to the drink. But, one morning recently, I found myself stirring coconut milk, fresh ginger and cinnamon in a saucepan with a turmeric powder paste. It smells uncomfortably reminiscent of a Pakistani curry made with yoghurt, turmeric and gram flour. I spoon in some honey, start whisking and hope for the best. Despite my low expectations, the first sip is surprisingly pleasant. The tartness of the turmeric is dulled by the milk and cinnamon. I don\u2019t like the fibrous ginger, but after straining the drink is creamy, with the comforting quality of a warm, yet slightly sweet, soup. It tastes nice when it has cooled down, too.     Turmeric and honey biscuits from Modern Baker    While haldi doodh is seen as the kind of old-school, antiquated drink a well-meaning relative would foist upon you, the turmeric latte is a world apart. \u201cThe trick is to use fresh cold-pressed turmeric juice,\u201d Arango says. Goop\u2019s recipe calls for almond milk, while Bon Appetit\u2019s iced version uses cashew. The Californian vegan restaurant chain Cafe Gratitude uses steamed almond milk with freshly squeezed turmeric juice and honey. Arango says coconut milk works better with turmeric, while Modern Baker primarily uses almond milk and varies it by adding coconut milk powder. Many recipes follow the south Asian playbook and use black pepper, which brings out the flavour of the turmeric. I still can\u2019t see myself ordering a turmeric latte out, though \u2013 this is one of the few times my Pakistani parents\u2019 \u201cwe can make this better and cheaper at home\u201d mantra is true. But, a day later, I find myself wondering what a caffeinated turmeric latte tastes like, and how I can get ahead of the next big south Asian trend.",
