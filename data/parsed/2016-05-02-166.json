  "body": "He was regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of the modern era, lost in an ice avalanche on Shishapangma, in Tibet, 16 years ago. Now the body of the American climber Alex Lowe, aged 40 when he died, has finally been found along with that of his climbing companion, 29-year old cameraman David Bridges, also American.   Related: Remains of climbing legend Alex Lowe found on Tibetan mountain    Fittingly perhaps, the bodies were discovered by the Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck \u2013 regarded as one of the the world\u2019s best current mountaineers \u2013 and his companion David Goettler, while acclimatising for an attempt on the south face of the 8,031metre-high (26,350ft) Shishapangma. The find brings closure to the lingering tragedy of their deaths on the world\u2019s 14th highest mountain. Lowe and Bridges had been on the mountain as part of nine-person team when they got lost on a 1999 expedition, which planned to first climb Shishapangma and then descend it on skis, in what they hoped would be the first US ski descent of an 8,000m peak. The two were buried and killed when an ice cliff collapsed above them as they crossed a glacier, with a third companion, Conrad Anker \u2013 whose exploits were documented in the recent film Meru \u2013 surviving. Anker suffered broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder. At the time of his death Lowe was regarded as one on the best in his field \u2013 not least for his extraordinary physiological gifts at altitude, which earned him the nickname the \u201cLung on Legs\u201d and \u201cthe Mutant\u201d. As the writer and climber Jim Perrin noted in his obituary for the Guardian, Lowe was not only supremely physically gifted, with a slew of hard ascents under his belt, but also an early adopter of using the internet to publicise his climbs.

In Peru, he climbed the south-west buttress of Taulliraju. Familiar with the risks of high-end mountaineering, he had been involved in the high-profile rescue of a group of trapped Spanish climbers on Denali, the highest peak in the US, four years before his death, carrying the stricken climbers on his back during the rescue. Lowe, as Perrin wrote, downplayed his role. \u201cIt was one of those things you do because you have to do it, one of those Herculean things where you get a lot of adrenaline going and you just do it.\u201d Confirmation of the discovery of Lowe and Bridges, came in a statement from Lowe\u2019s widow, Jennifer, now married to his friend Anker. She said Steck and Gottlieb had discovered the remains of two people in a partially melted glacier and described the details of their clothing and backpacks to her.

We are thankful,\u201d Jenni Lowe-Anker said. In the last paragraph of her memoir, Forget Me Not, Lowe-Anker had predicted a day would come when her former husband\u2019s body would be found. \u201cAlex will melt out of the glacier one day \u2026 and I do not look forward to it.\u201d In the statement, released by the charitable foundation founded in Lowe\u2019s name, she added: \u201cAlex\u2019s parents are thankful to know that their son\u2019s body has been found and that Conrad, the boys and I will make our pilgrimage to Shishapangma. It is time to put Alex to rest.\u201d Anker also said the discovery has brought closure and relief to him. He told Outside magazine that although he had not seen photos of the remains, he was convinced they are those of Lowe and Bridges. \u201cThey were close to each other. Blue and red North Face backpacks. Yellow Koflach [mountaineering] boots. It was all that gear from that time period. They were pretty much the only two climbers who were there.\u201d Bridges, 29, of Aspen, Colorado, was an accomplished high-altitude climber and cinematographer.   Shishapangma location",
