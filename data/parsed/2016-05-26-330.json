The prime minister committed $130m to one dam near Rockhampton and a further $20m to feasibility studies for 14 others across the state. The government said the Rockwood weir project near Rockhampton would create 2,100 jobs in farming. The list of 14 possible dams, which will proceed to feasibility studies, run the length of the state and were touted as having the potential to drought-proof Queensland. \u201cOur government is serious about ensuring water infrastructure gets built as quickly as possible, to help support jobs and growth in regional communities,\u201d said the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce.

Turnbull said: \u201cAs the economy transitions and diversifies, agricultural exports are playing a more important role than ever before.\u201d But an analysis by WWF warned that six of the proposed dams are in rivers that run into the embattled Great Barrier Reef and would increase pollution there. The news comes a day after the Queensland government announced a plan for how it would spend $90m to improve water quality on the reef, and after more than $500m has been spent on reducing pollution between 2009 and 2016. On Wednesday, announcing recommendations to the Queensland government for how to improve water quality, the state\u2019s chief scientist, Geoff Garrett, said: \u201cIf we carry on as we are with poor water quality we are stuffed with a capital \u2018S\u2019 underlined, bold.\u201d On Thursday, a WWF spokesman, Nick Heath, said: \u201cTo borrow a phrase from the chief scientist \u2013 if these dams go ahead the reef will be even more stuffed with a capital S.\u201d WWF said if the six proposed dams in the Great Barrier Reef catchment were built, nitrogen pollution on the reef would increase by more than 2,500 tonnes each year as a result of increased fertiliser use.

Jon Brodie, an expert in coral reefs and water quality at James Cook University, said if you increased cropping in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, you increased the amount of fertiliser that ran into the reef. He said if the 2,500 figure was correct, that would be significant. Brodie said there needed to be tight regulations on farming practice if the dams went ahead. \u201cAny new cropping lands in the Great Barrier Reef catchment will need to, by law, use best management practice,\u201d he said.",
