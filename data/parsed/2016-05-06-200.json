Potus was joined by wife Michelle, R2-D2 and and a couple of stormtroopers in the White House.  Obama may have got the thumbs up for his moves but he earned a scathing \u201cOh really\u201d from the Queen when he sent a supportive message for Prince Harry\u2019s Invictus Games in Orlando. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau was quick to respond with his own \u201cboom\u201d message to back the sports event, which is open to all wounded, injured and sick serving military personnel and veterans. James Corden\u2019s carpool karaoke with Gwen Stefani got a little star crowded when he ended up in the high occupancy vehicle lane and had to pick up a couple of extra passengers \u2013 Julia Roberts and George Clooney.  Police across the globe are tuning into the Running Man challenge and creating their own dance videos. The challenge began with a video by New Zealand officers who filmed the running man dance as part of a recruitment drive. They want to sign up 400 new officers by the end of 2016, particularly of Maori, Pacific Island, Asian, Middle Eastern and Indian descent. They asked: \u201cAre you up for it Victoria police, NSW police force, Western Australia police, Queensland police service, South Australia police, ACT policing, Tasmania police, LAPD headquarters, Isles of Scilly police and NYPD?\u201d The challenge was picked up by the NYPD who were filmed dancing by New York\u2019s Brooklyn Bridge and then by police officers in Edinburgh who danced in front of the castle. Who will be next?
