  "body": "Pax is a book about a boy and his pet, but the funny thing is that his pet is a fox!  One day Peter\u2019s dad takes him and his fox to the woods and he leaves the fox in the woods on his own. Peter is very sad about this and worries about his pet. Peter is then sent away to live with his granddad as his mum is dead and his dad has to go away. Peter doesn\u2019t want to live with his granddad and he really wants to find Pax \u2013 he thinks he might be dead because he can\u2019t hunt for food. But Pax, though very hungry, is still alive and has made friends with some other foxes.       Not long after getting to his granddad\u2019s house, Peter leaves with a few things in a bag to try and find his fox. Although he can remember how to get there, it is a very long way to walk. Eventually, he falls over and breaks his leg and finds a barn owned by a weird lady called Vola. She helps Peter get better and fixes his leg so he can see his fox again. When his leg is much better and he can walk on crutches, Peter goes to find Pax. After a long and hard journey, Peter finds Pax and they recognise each other straight away, but Pax has a new family and doesn\u2019t need Peter anymore. I liked this story because it is like me and my dog. I wouldn\u2019t want my pet to be sent away and I would walk a long way to find her too. The ending is sad and I wanted them to go home together. I would recommend this book because the characters are very real and I like that it\u2019s about a boy and his pet fox because that\u2019s quite unusual. The story is happy and sad and I think many people will like it.   Related: How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
