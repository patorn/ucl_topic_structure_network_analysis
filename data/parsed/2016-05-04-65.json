  "body": "When Jen Feuerstein last saw Tara, she was only three. Feuerstein, a biologist, remembers the chimpanzee as \u201cvery playful and active\u201d. Her aunt, Georgia, was \u201ca beautiful, slender, dark female \u2026 who radiated intelligence and was very close to her family\u201d. Thirteen years later, Feuerstein and a global group of plaintiffs are suing the US government to stop the transfer of Tara, Georgia, and six other chimpanzees that are no longer being used for research to a zoo across the Atlantic that has not received accreditation from major European or British zoo authorities, Wingham wildlife park, in Kent, England. Feuerstein and two other former researchers at Yerkes National Primate Research Center say the transfer will be detrimental to the chimpanzees\u2019 health and won\u2019t improve the chances of their species\u2019 survival.  Plaintiffs are concerned that transporting the eight chimpanzees in cages on an international flight and housing them in a zoo that has not housed chimpanzees before would \u201cexacerbate the traumas they are already suffering as a result of the laboratory conditions and experimentation to which they have been exposed\u201d, according to the complaint. The move would also set a dangerous precedent and violate the spirit of the Endangered Species Act, they say. \u201cExport of the chimpanzees to an unaccredited zoo will not in any way enhance the survival of the species,\u201d the complaint says. The case is the first time a private facility has sought a permit from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to ship abroad chimpanzees that were formerly used for research, after the federal government listed captive chimpanzees as protected under the Endangered Species Act last year, and on the heels of a halt in federal funding for research on chimpanzees from the National Institutes of Health.    I want them to have a great future. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s being offered to them now  Jen Feuerstein     Plaintiffs, which include the New England Anti-Vivisection Society (NEAVS), London-based Cruelty-Free International, and Canada\u2019s Fauna Foundation, point to several decades of research and activism that has resulted in hundreds of formerly captive chimpanzees \u201cretiring\u201d from research and living healthier lives in accredited US sanctuaries \u2013 and note that several of these sanctuaries offered to take the chimps from Yerkes, which includes a price tag of up to $20,000 a year for their care.  \u201cI want them to have a great future,\u201d said Feuerstein, who left Yerkes in 2003 and spent more than a decade working at Save the Chimps. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s being offered to them now.\u201d Feuerstein said the trip alone would pose \u201cunnecessary risks\u201d to the psychological and physical health of the endangered animals, adding that transporting chimpanzees on transatlantic flights has been \u201cextraordinarily unusual\u201d since the federal government declared chimps in the wild as endangered in 1975. She noted that they can respond to anesthesia by vomiting and could choke on their own vomit if not accompanied by a trained person on the flight.     Feuerstein said that chimpanzees held in captivity for research can exhibit behaviors similar to PTSD, including \u2018self-abuse, rocking back and forth, and increased aggression\u2019.

The complaint also warns that placing the chimpanzees at Wingham could \u201caggravate, rather than relieve, their psychological distress and aberrant behaviors\u201d. Feuerstein said that chimpanzees held in captivity for research can exhibit behaviors similar to PTSD, including \u201cself-abuse, rocking back and forth, and increased aggression\u201d. These conditions \u201ccan be treated and alleviated\u201d, she added \u2013 \u201cwith the help of specialized care, in sanctuaries\u201d. Markus Wilder, animal collection curator for Wingham wildlife park, said in response: \u201cIt is incorrect that we have no previous experience with chimpanzees. We have animal care staff who have worked with chimpanzees, and our vet has extensive experience working with great apes.\u201d Wilder also said Wingham has been licensed by the UK to operate as a zoo.  Even as this lawsuit remains ongoing, the chimps could be shipped to London as early as this week, according to the complaint.  \u201cIt will be terrifying,\u201d Feuerstein said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never undergone anything like that in their lives.\u201d  At least two US sanctuaries for chimpanzees \u201cretired\u201d from research have approached Yerkes about receiving the group, and NEAVS said it will pay for Georgia\u2019s care at any sanctuary. The FWS wouldn\u2019t comment on the case. A Yerkes spokeswoman, Lisa Newbern, sent press releases concerning the months-long case in an email, and wrote in a separate email that details about the offers from US sanctuaries were \u201cconfidential\u201d. Theodora Capaldo, NEAVS president, was critical of another wrinkle in the case, in which Yerkes and Wingham offered to pay $45,000 a year for five years to the Population and Sustainability Network, which in exchange would protect chimpanzees in the wild. \u201cThe whole concept of allowing individual endangered species to be exported for commercial use by giving money to a third party that does conservation work is essentially allowing them to buy a permit,\u201d Capaldo said. A review of communications between Tim Van Norman, charged with international permits for the FWS, and Joyce Cohen, associate director of animal resources at Yerkes, reveals that the federal agency suggested in an email that supporting the population network\u2019s work might be \u201cright up Yerkes\u2019 path\u201d. By the end of the month, Cohen wrote the federal agency of plans to make the donation as part of an \u201cenhancement\u201d to the research center\u2019s application. In other words, the research center, with the federal agency\u2019s help, had found a way to at least appear to satisfy the requirement for enhancing species survival. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop groups from all over the world from trading in endangered species by donating a few thousand to conservation groups?\u201d Capaldo said.",
