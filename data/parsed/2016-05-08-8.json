  "body": "Fingers crossed for clear skies: the transit of Mercury across the face of the Sun on Monday is the first since 2003, and will be visible across much of Earth (with apologies to Australia and eastern Asia). For those located in the UK, it\u2019s the most favourable transit until 2247, by which time many* of us are likely to be dead.    Related: How to see Mercury transit the sun on 9 May    If you\u2019re planning on watching the planet\u2019s journey across the face of the sun, which begins at 12:12 BST and completes its passage at 19:42 BST, our \u2018how to\u2019 guide to the event contains all the crucial information, including this crucial paragraph:   Watching at least part of the transit will be popular but it is of paramount importance to observe safely. Never look directly at the sun with any optical device \u2013 including phone cameras \u2013 nor with the unaided eye. This can result in permanent injury or blindness. The Open University has made a safety video that is recommended viewing.   But with all this in mind, if you have the right equipment, or are attending an astronomy event on the day, we\u2019d love to see your photos and videos and hear your stories.
