  "body": "They come clutching banners, flags and pi\u00f1atas, some with masks, others with megaphones, to do battle with Trumpers. The venue changes but the rules remain the same: get as close as you can to the arena, shout long and loud, starve the trolls and, as the sun goes down, watch out. So it goes at what passes for the pointy end of American politics: protesters v supporters at Donald Trump rallies. There were protests at almost every stop of the Republican candidate\u2019s western swing this week, veering from a carnival-like vibe to violence.  At least 18 people received medical attention in San Diego on Friday night after police declared an unlawful assembly in the Gaslamp Quarter, close to where Trump held a rally hours earlier. Helicopters hovered as police in riot gear announced in Spanish and English that people must disperse. Most of the week\u2019s protests were relatively small, barely a few dozen-strong in some places. But those who attended felt these were the opening skirmishes in what promises to be a long, hot summer of street activism triggered by Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Latino immigrants, Muslims and other minorities.

Protesters, some with Mexican flags, swarmed the interlopers as mounted police looked on. The groups jostled and traded insults. \u201cRacists!\u201d \u201cIllegals!\u201d \u201cScum!\u201d The melee continued for several blocks bordering Disneyland. Protesters snatched Make America Great Again caps and some flags from the outnumbered Trump supporters, who clustered for protection.    Trump supporters march into protest. Socratic exchanges.

They\u2019re taking our jobs,\u201d said Tyler Rogers, 23, a wild land firefighter. And now they had taken his hat, which two protesters tried to set on fire. It flared briefly, then smoldered.  Irene Rodriguez, 42, a Trump-supporting optician, looked dazed: \u201cShe took my flag and stomped all over it, some Mexican chick. I told her, \u2018you can do what you want to me, but not the flag. Show some respect\u2019.\u201d As helicopters hovered overhead, police briefly sealed thousands of Trump supporters inside the Anaheim convention center car park while a handful of protesters paraded past, defying orders to disperse. The Trump supporters jeered and chanted. \u201cUSA!\u201d Then: \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d A young Latina draped in a Mexican tricolor gave the finger and screamed rebuttals in Spanish and English. \u201cExcuse my language, but fuck you all.\u201d Sixteen people were later arrested. A day earlier in Albuquerque, New Mexico, protesters overturned crowd control barriers, threw rocks at police and smashed the door of the convention center where Trump had spoken. Interviews with pro and anti groups this week offered a sharp contrast in mood \u2013 glee on one side, trepidation the other. They expressed at least one thing in common: pride in taking their beliefs onto the street unlike the rest of America which, as they saw it, sat on its ass, watching TV or dabbling in social media, debating Trump. \u201cI felt I had to be here,\u201d said Gerardo Carvajal, 19, a student from Costa Mesa, in Anaheim. He was soft-spoken and had a geekish critique. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any real policies. The way he presents himself is not presidential.\u201d Carvajal\u2019s sign was blunter: \u201cFuck Trump.\u201d Rogelio Banuelos, 27, also mild-mannered, complained that elites were not speaking out against the candidate\u2019s \u201cracism, misogyny, xenophobia and ableism\u201d. His sign featured the word \u201cfuck\u201d six times.    Rogelio Banuelos, undocumented, protesting #TrumpRally.

Oddly, the people holding them can be mild and soft-spoken when you talk to them, like Carvajal. Some go for humor. \u201cBuild a wall around Trump\u2019s hair. I will pay for it,\u201d said that of Chuck Tyson, 56, an ex-Republican in San Diego. Some seem designed more to provoke than sway. \u201cDon\u2019t be a estupido gringo. Don\u2019t vote 4 Trump.\u201d Use of the Mexican flag divides protesters. For Luis Blanco, 32, who waved a big one in Anaheim, it represented pride in the land of his parents. \u201cIt\u2019s for my family. They\u2019re hard workers. Donald Trump is a scumbag.\u201d When someone hoisted a pin\u00e3ta version of Trump\u2019s head atop a Mexican flag the crowd roared. Photographers scrambled for the best shot.  A media-savvy protester sensed it would be better atop another protester\u2019s US flag. The owner hesitated. \u201cPeople are so angry they\u2019ll burn it.\u201d With trepidation, he handed it over. The head was transferred and a bigger roar erupted.  Some signs are getting more sophisticated, at least aesthetically. Members of an LA-based indigenous rights group called Mexica this week brandished glossy, colorful depictions of the Donald as the Joker beside a swastika: \u201cStop Nazi Trump. Go back to Europe now!\u201d    'Trump supporters don't want to make America great again. They want to make America  white again.' #TrumpRally pic.twitter.com/uM6RoZMTdR\u2014 Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) May 25, 2016    They were spanking new, said Olin Tezcatlipoca, the group\u2019s director. \u201cWe\u2019re here doing what the Jews should have done in the 1930s when they saw the rise of Hitler. He\u2019s a Nazi, he\u2019s a white supremacist. It looks like now it\u2019s getting serious and we have to get the word out.\u201d  All week a handful of Christian activists with megaphones and a huge banner praising Jesus have turned up early at Trump events, nabbing the best spot, infuriating protesters. The Christians bait the crowd as illegals and perverts. They turned up again in San Diego. Insults in Spanish only encouraged them. \u201cThis is America. We speak English. We don\u2019t understand you.\u201d Some Trump supporters skip his rallies to troll protests. \u201cThose guys chanting, they\u2019re just dumbasses,\u201d said Gary Pollard, 35, a navy veteran-turned Disneyland worker in Anaheim. He had to shout to be heard over chants of \u201cDonald Trump must go, hey hey, ho ho\u201d. Pollard scorned the Trump-Hitler comparisons. \u201cNazi Germany started with socialized healthcare and gun control.\u201d Then he joined protesters walking in a circle, jigging and lumbering from side to side, for comic effect.

As an anti-Trump rap song blared from a boombox, protesters hung a pi\u00f1ata of the casino mogul from a traffic sign.",
