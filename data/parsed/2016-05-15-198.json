  "body": "Radiohead have long trafficked in existential dread and political anger, and in a wider sense of twitchy bereftness that bends to fit any number of scenarios \u2013 their very own aural shade of Yves Klein blue, maybe, just a little more bruised. This arresting ninth album is bathed in it.    \u2018The damage is done,\u2019 Yorke sings, even more exhausted than usual    Overshadowed by the break-up of singer Thom Yorke\u2019s relationship, announced last year, A Moon Shaped Pool finds the band mining their long and deep back catalogue, while pushing their compositional skills relentlessly forwards. Where 2011\u2019s more granular and underrated The King of Limbs revelled in beats, A Moon Shaped Pool marks a frequent relaxation into more conventional songcraft \u2013 manna from heaven for a certain stripe of Radiohead fan. Jonny Greenwood\u2019s film score sideline pays dividends, too, in the string arrangements and modern classical introduction to Glass Eyes. The album starts and finishes on two older songs, material reworked in the light of new developments. Dating from as long ago as the Hail to the Thief sessions, Burn the Witch is A Moon Shaped Pool\u2019s most forthright political statement, a warning against scapegoating outsiders that trailed the album\u2019s release with a startling stop-motion animation video.         Watch the video to Burn the Witch.    At the far end of the tracklisting is True Love Waits, a relic that has been around since circa 1995. The title may tilt at the religion-inspired US celibacy movement, but the song \u2013 now made up of piano, vocals and percussion that sounds like a beetle using a typewriter \u2013 is about a fraught sense of love. (The \u201clollipops and crisps\u201d line refers to a mother who left her young child alone for days with junk food). It climaxes with the words \u201cdon\u2019t leave\u201d. You would not want to be so crass as to call this Radiohead\u2019s break-up album; after all, there are four other band members. A song such as The Numbers (formerly known as Silent Spring) uses found sound, a little cosmic jazz, folk-rock acoustic guitar and accusatory strings to seethe specifically about ecocide. Ful Stop, meanwhile, is six minutes of encroaching electronic menace whose lyrics self-flagellate quite mercilessly. But a few songs appear to conjoin macro with micro, with a sense of loss that encompasses disintegration on the home front and in the wider world. Daydreaming is one. \u201cThe damage is done,\u201d Yorke sings, even more exhausted than usual. Things have got \u201cbeyond the point of no return\u201d, and \u201cthis goes beyond me/Beyond you\u201d. The coda is back-masked and sinister: \u201cHalf of my life,\u201d it goes, according to people who have played it backwards. At a guess, it\u2019s the 23 years the 47-year-old Yorke spent with the mother of his children, crowning a piano-led ballad in which it is easy to read divorce as well as disaster.",
