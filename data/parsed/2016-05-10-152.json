  "body": "Conservative MPs have warned the government that any attack on the BBC\u2019s editorial independence would provoke a revolt on the backbenches. Damian Green, a former home office minister, told the Guardian that attempts to influence the BBC\u2019s ability to schedule its own programmes or to stuff its board with government appointees would be opposed by several Conservative MPs. \u201cIt is an issue within the party,\u201d he said. MPs fear that the white paper to be published on Thursday could give the government too much influence over the BBC, with plans to give greater powers to a new unitary board and media regulator Ofcom, and to curtail the corporation\u2019s content.    Related: BBC charter renewal: the main sticking points    One senior MP, who declined to be named, said there were fears that the culture secretary was picking an ideological fight at a time when there were much bigger areas of contention, such as Europe. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree with my government on much but I feel passionate about the BBC,\u201d they said.  Green, a member of the cabinet until 2014, is understood to have made his views known to the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, who has been widely reported as wanting to take a tough stance on the management of the BBC. \u201cMy red line is independence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe BBC needs to take its own decisions on scheduling and the government needs to make it clear that the people making decisions at the BBC are not being run by the government of the day, whatever government it is.\u201d Green, a former journalist for the Times, Channel 4 and the BBC, declined to say whether the group of MPs had complained to the prime minister. \u201cWe are waiting anxiously to see what\u2019s in the white paper ... and hoping that these so-called leaks may be more scary than the real thing,\u201d he said. Another MP suggested that the biggest attack on the BBC\u2019s independence may be hidden in the small print of the white paper and therefore not necessarily picked up by Downing Street, which tends to leave secretaries of state to deal with the detail. \u201cUnless it\u2019s reasonable it [the white paper] will go nowhere,\u201d the MP said. However, it is unclear how much MPs can do, given the fact that the royal charter governing the BBC is finally defined by an agreement between the culture secretary and the BBC following the publication of the white paper. The current 10-year charter runs out at the end of this year. The white paper is also expected to tighten the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines to ensure its content is distinctive and impartial. However one BBC source was dismissive of the idea that adding these words to its guidelines would change much, saying: \u201cIf all it means is inform, educate and entertain, but be distinctive with it, then that\u2019s fine as we think we already are. Equally, we are already committed to impartiality as it is enshrined in our published editorial guidelines.\u201d Criticism from within the Conservative party comes after a cross-party group of peers launched a campaign against mooted government cuts to the BBC and a host of celebrities spoke out in defence of the corporation. One of the peers, Liberal Democrat Lord Lester, was critical of plans to publish the white paper on Thursday, just before a recess. His party would fight \u201cgovernment plans to stifle proper debate,\u201d he said. Whittingdale and his advisers at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, are understood to be planning to appoint at least half of the new unitary board, as well as marking a historic end to the corporation\u2019s self-regulation. Clare Foges, chief speechwriter to David Cameron for four years until 2015, wrote about the situation of the government attacking an institution which is broadly supported by the public, including many Conservatives: \u201cUndermining the envy of the world would make us the idiots of the world,\u201d she wrote in the Times on Monday (paywall). \u201cIt would be like the US attacking Hollywood or France its wine producers.\u201d \u201cThere are a number of us who broadly agree with what Clare wrote,\u201d said Green. A private members bill published by a group of peers including Lord Lester has been tabled for the same day as next week\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech amid concern that the white paper has been rushed out on the last day before recess. \u201cThe Government must not be allowed to sneak out their white paper on the BBC on Thursday when Parliament is away. It is vital that proper scrutiny is given to what the government is proposing for the future of this important institution,\u201d he wrote.",
