  "body": "Tim Howard signed off with a clean sheet \u2013 Everton\u2019s first at home since 3\u00a0February \u2013 but it was his prediction that Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s successor would be \u201csitting on a goldmine\u201d of talent that resonated most at Goodison Park. Teenage debutants shone as Everton ended a tumultuous week and season with a convincing victory against Norwich City. David Unsworth, the under-21s coach in temporary charge following Mart\u00ednez\u2019s dismissal on Thursday, believes that Everton have \u201cseven or eight players who are ready now or in 12 months to play in the first team\u201d. He backed those words with action, handing the 17-year-old Tom Davies and the 18-year-old Kieran Dowell full debuts in midfield and giving the under\u201121s captain Jonjoe Kenny his first senior outing from the bench. All three excelled as Everton recorded only their second win in 11 matches thanks to goals from James McCarthy, Leighton Baines and Kevin Mirallas, although the uncertainty around Goodison includes whether the trio will also be valued by whoever is in permanent charge next season.

I had no hesitation in putting Jonjoe in. Kieran showed flashes of genius and the quality he\u2019s shown for the under-21s all season. And for me Tom Davies was man of the match. He was everything we want in an Everton central midfield player \u2013 all action, good on the ball and quick to spot danger. It was a great all-round midfield performance.\u201d Unsworth\u2019s selection, taken in conjunction with Joe Royle and the first-team coach Duncan Ferguson, was also instructive for the omission of Ramiro Funes Mori and Oumar Niasse. Young potential is part of Mart\u00ednez\u2019s legacy at Goodison but so too is the \u00a324m spent on two imports who did the former manager few favours before this summer\u2019s recruitment drive. Davies and Dowell repaid their coach\u2019s confidence with assured, creative displays. They had the trust of senior players, judging by how they were given the ball at every available opportunity, and were instrumental in the defeat of a Norwich team that brought commitment but precious little quality to Goodison. John Ruddy, the visiting goalkeeper, had saved twice in quick succession from Romelu Lukaku before McCarthy swept Everton ahead. The goal owed plenty to Dowell\u2019s determination and Unsworth\u2019s decision to play the Republic of Ireland international in a more advanced role. The teenager drove at the heart of the Norwich defence and, when the ball broke loose 20 yards out, the midfielder sent an excellent first time finish inside Ruddy\u2019s left-hand post. \u201cThe first goal summed us up this season,\u201d lamented Alex Neil, who could only say it \u201clooks likely\u201d he will be Norwich\u2019s manager in the Championship next season. \u201cCameron [Jerome] has a good chance from eight yards out, the keeper makes a comfortable save and 20 seconds later it is in the back of our net. It was a good strike by McCarthy but you\u2019ve got to look at how it\u2019s got there.\u201d Nathan Redmond and Matt Jarvis both put decent chances to equalise over Howard\u2019s crossbar. The veteran goalkeeper was making his 414th and final appearance for Everton after a decade at the club. A clean sheet and an emotional farewell to the Gwladys Street provided the perfect send-off for his move to Colorado Rapids. Unsworth\u2019s side doubled their lead, somewhat fortuitously, when Romelu Lukaku collapsed inside the Norwich area following slight contact from Robbie Brady. Goodison erupted with ironic cheers when Leighton Baines stepped forward to take the penalty having had the responsibility removed under Mart\u00ednez. Baines duly sent Ruddy the wrong way from 12 yards. \u201cIt was really soft and changed the dynamic of the game,\u201d Neil claimed. Everton\u2019s third was a rewarding moment for the club\u2019s academy, Unsworth included. The tenacious Davies regained possession with a strong tackle in central midfield, Dowell released Kenny down the right and when the full-back\u2019s cross deflected across the Norwich goalmouth, Kevin Mirallas was unmarked to convert at the back post. Dowell had a brief spell in his favoured playmaker\u2019s role as Unsworth shifted to a 4-4-1-1. His awareness and his accurate left foot had Goodison purring before he departed to a deserved standing ovation when replaced by Ross Barkley. The future appears both bright and blurred for Everton.
