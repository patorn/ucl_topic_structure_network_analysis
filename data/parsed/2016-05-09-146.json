  "body": "Tyreik Gilford spends his days in a 14ft by 9ft cell. When the Guardian asked him to describe his living space, it didn\u2019t take him long because there\u2019s really not that much to say about it. There\u2019s a stainless steel bunk bed with two levels, a shower \u2013 with no door or curtain, so no privacy from the other inmate in the cell \u2013 and a toilet that sits 3ft from the face of the unlucky inhabitant of the lower bunk. In the middle of the cell there is a neon light that is forever glowing. It remains on at night, though it does dim a little.  A table sticks out from one side of the cell with two retractable seats attached. The walls, floor and ceiling are concrete, a sea of dull grey. You can barely see out. There are no bars on the door, which is made of solid steel. Gilford has been housed in a number of types of solitary cell. At the moment he\u2019s in a double cell where he\u2019s cooped up in a tiny space with another prisoner. These are often among the worst conditions in which to be held in lockdown. The space is even more limited than in single cells, the inmates are still kept behind a closed door for at least 22 hours a day, and given the high proportion of solitary prisoners who are struggling with mental illness, it can be harrowing. Sometimes it proves fatal. \u201cEvery day when I sit in my cell I can hear other inmates yelling from they [sic] cell, politicking about this and that, all types of dumb stuff,\u201d Gilford wrote. There\u2019s a hatch at the bottom of the door. It gives prison officers access so they can shackle Gilford\u2019s ankles on the rare occasions they let him out. Another slot in the door is for food to be shoved through \u2013 7am breakfast, 11.30am lunch, 4.30pm dinner. He can\u2019t see who\u2019s giving him the meals, just their disembodied fingertips. The only view of the outside world is a 32ins by 15ins window at the back of the cell. \u201cI can see outside and the sky. Unfortunately, from the position of the window, I cannot see the sun rise, set, or the moon at night,\u201d Gilford said. There\u2019s a door at the back of the cell through which he\u2019s allowed to pass to spend one or two hours a day in an outside space measuring 29ft by 8ft. It\u2019s a cage, that\u2019s all it is, but at least the air feels fresh. They call it the recreation yard. That\u2019s pretty much it. Gilford spends 22 hours of every day sitting in his cell, surrounded by steel and concrete. Concrete and steel. Trying to hold it together.   6x9   There\u2019s nothing exceptional about Gilford or his day-to-day existence. He\u2019s one of as many as 100,000 men, women and children locked away in concrete boxes across the US, a country that puts people in solitary confinement at a rate virtually unparalleled.  The UN has denounced the type of conditions in which Gilford is currently held in the isolation wing of an upstate New York prison, saying they could amount to torture, and  Barack Obama has described them as an \u201caffront to our common humanity\u201d. Gilford, 26, was sentenced last year to six years in prison for selling drugs, having been arrested by police in 2013 on the stairwell of his Harlem project building. He says he is innocent and was mistakenly caught up in the search. Last November, his troubles deepened. He was transferred from the general prison population to a \u201cspecial housing unit\u201d, or SHU, at the Upstate Correctional Facility in Malone, after he was found with a small amount of marijuana. In other words, he was put into solitary confinement.     The letter that Gilford wrote to Ed Pilkington from his cell. Photograph: The Guardian    Gilford sent a letter to the Guardian recently from his isolation cell. In it, he described the changes he could detect in himself as a result of being removed from ordinary human association. \u201cIt\u2019s making me antisocial,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd it affects my relationship with my love one. I\u2019m not able to hear or speak with them, I\u2019m only able to see them once a week, and even then I can\u2019t touch them like how I would like to.\u201d Gilford is allowed weekly visits, but at the start of his time in the SHU he was chained outside the cell, and he can only talk to his family through a steel mesh. Even that limited degree of contact is vitally important to him, helping him to deal with the well-established psychological trauma caused by being held in isolation. \u201cI do have trouble sleeping at night and I often feel depressed because of the situation I\u2019m in. When I don\u2019t hear from people that I love, I get upset. If I don\u2019t get a visit I get upset because being in that cell for so long makes me feel box in.\u201d New York state has recently moved away from the addiction to solitary confinement that holds so many states across the country in its grip. In response to a lawsuit brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union, a deal has been reached under which the state will rein in its use of isolation cells. As part of the deal, solitary confinement has been banned for juvenile prisoners, a reform replicated this year by Obama across the federal prison system. Several other reforms have been approved, including limiting the time people can be kept in SHUs and the provision of alternative punishment regimes.

As is so often the case with solitary prisoners, he received a second three-month punishment while he was in the SHU that prolonged his lockdown for another 90 days. He is scheduled to come out of the box in June, but the way things are he\u2019s fearful he\u2019ll get another extension. And so it goes on. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing to put inmates into lockdown,\u201d Gilford wrote in his letter. \u201cFor one, I don\u2019t think it makes the behavior better. Plus it\u2019s bad enough we already lock down, so to be in lockdown on top of being lock down is just too much.\u201d",
