  "body": "The rediscovery of a 15th-century illuminated edition of Aristotle\u2019s De animalibus (On Animals) in Tennessee late last year was \u201cpretty incredible\u201d, said Christina Geiger, director of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams auction house in New York. Not only is the book an \u201cincunable\u201d \u2013 printed before 1501, when the ink was still wet on moveable type \u2013 but this deluxe copy was printed on vellum, or animal skin. Only one other copy exists and it belongs to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris. Aristotle, who lived from 384 to 322 BC, was a keen observer of natural history, and the three texts that comprise De animalibus reveal his aptitude for zoology, physiology, and embryology; he describes more than 500 species. He explains, for example, the development of a chick embryo and makes astute deductions about the anatomy of marine animals, such as whales, dolphins, octopi, and crustaceans that have been called \u201cremarkably accurate\u201d. Even paper copies of this edition of De animalibus are scarce; only three have come to auction since 1978.

The auctioneers believe that Gaspare da Padova is the artist responsible for the volume\u2019s decorative initials and borders painted in gold and various colors. A handful of special vellum copies were probably produced for sponsors. Only one was thought to have survived before this recent finding. Bonhams will offer the Renaissance-era rarity at auction in New York on 8 June. It is estimated to fetch $300,000 to $500,000.  The book last surfaced at auction on 5 March 1891, when American publisher and book collector William Evarts Benjamin purchased it for $850. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he sold it or kept it,\u201d said Geiger. \u201cWe checked all of his catalogues over at the Grolier Club and we checked his archives at Columbia and couldn\u2019t find a reference to it. But he\u2019s listed as the buyer in 1891, and then it just fell off the map completely.\u201d No proof of the volume\u2019s existence appears in the Census of 15th Century Books Owned in America published in 1919. The consignors\u2019 grandmother acquired the book before 1964. The family retains letters between her and a librarian she contacted to make inquiries. \u201cThose intervening years are a big question mark,\u201d said Geiger. \u201cPart of what\u2019s interesting for me is that if that sale in 1891 had been just a few years later, [De animalibus] probably would have been bought by Huntington or Morgan or one of the great collectors of incunables in America, but it was just a little bit too early.\u201d  Geiger\u2019s research turned up a long line of distinguished ownership before that 1891 sale, beginning with Luigi Serra, fourth Duke of Cassano (1747-1825). It then moved through the hands of bookseller James Edwards to Sir Mark Masterman-Sykes, the famed nineteenth-century book collector, who had it re-bound in red morocco gilt. His coat of arms still embellishes the binding. It was while De animalibus was in Sir Mark\u2019s collection that the well-known English bibliophile TF Dibdin had the opportunity to see it. He recorded his impression in his Bibliographical Decameron (1817): \u201cYet how can I omit to mention, with the distinction which it merits, the very beautiful, if not matchless, copy of Theodore Gaza\u2019s Latin version of Aristotle upon Animals, of the date of 1476, in folio, UPON VELLUM, from the press of John of Cologne \u2013 of which my friend Sir MM Sykes is the fortunate possessor?! If my memory be not treacherous, this is the most exquisite specimen of an early Venetian vellum book that I have ever seen.\u201d   Related: Auction of rare items from African American history \u2013 in pictures    Geiger said: \u201cThis is that very copy, almost exactly 200 years later,. You could probably go back and find out when he was at Sykes\u2019 home. I haven\u2019t gone back that deep, but [Dibdin\u2019s] book was published in 1817, so here we are in 2016 and [De animalibus] is in the same condition. That\u2019s the other thing. For a book that fell through the cracks, it didn\u2019t get run over. It\u2019s just in beautiful condition.\u201d Other 19th-century owners of the volume include English publisher and bookseller William Pickering, Sir John Hayford Thorold, bookseller and collector Bernard Quaritch, and American railway tycoon and banker Brayton Ives.  The Vatican Library holds a manuscript version of Gaza\u2019s translation. Pope Nicholas V, founder of what would become the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, didn\u2019t live to see the final product of his commission. Instead, this edition was dedicated to Pope Sixtus IV.",
