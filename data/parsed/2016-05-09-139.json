  "body": "For those concerned about wrinkly old skin, it might be an ingenious solution: a stretchy \u201csecond skin\u201d that can be smoothed on to make aged tissue look more youthful. The wearable film developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology has shown promise in a series of small trials where it was applied to wrinkles, under-eye bags and patches of dry skin.   Related: Can a drink really make skin look younger?    When applied to the face or body, the thin, transparent layer adheres to the skin and supports the tissue, making it look and behave like younger skin, its creators claim. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to do is create a cream that you can put on the skin and then when it\u2019s on the skin it can actually form essentially an elastic second skin,\u201d said Bob Langer, who led the research. Tests in the lab found that the polymer film, which is only 70 thousandths of a millimetre thick, reduced the appearance of wrinkles and under-eye bagging, and helped retain moisture in patches of dry skin.     The most impressive results came when the scientists applied the film to under-eye bags: the eye on the left has had the film applied.

In pilot studies, the second skin withstood normal daily wear, and the stresses and strains of exercise and swimming, without falling off or causing irritation. It also weathered exposure to rain. \u201cIt\u2019s something you can wear for a whole day or longer depending on the physical forces that get applied to the area where it is worn,\u201d said Daniel Anderson, who helped develop the product at MIT. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell you\u2019re wearing it.\u201d \u201cYou can rub it from the corner and peel it off. But it doesn\u2019t do that under standard manipulation. We don\u2019t want something that falls off,\u201d he added. While normal cosmetics can mask imperfections on the skin, the new coating changes the way skin behaves by giving it the elasticity of young skin. It was developed with help from two MIT spin-out companies: Living Proof, a cosmetics firm, and Olivo Labs, a medical company. With more work, they believe the films could be used to mask port-wine stain birthmarks, to protect the face from UV rays, or to treat skin disorders such as eczema. Another hope is to create films that contain drugs, which can be released slowly onto skin to treat disease or wounds.

The first cream is a siloxane polymer which conforms to the contours of the skin. The second cream contains a platinum catalyst that makes the siloxane cross-link into a thin, stretchy sheet. Tiny particles in the second cream diffuse the light and give the layer a youthful appearance, according to a study in Nature Materials. The physical properties of the film are tuned to match the elasticity of young skin. Once the creams are mixed on the face, the layer takes about three minutes to reach full strength. The film is nearly invisible on the skin, but in tests the edge of the film became noticeable in two out of 25 people after 16 hours of wear.    Related: Scientists grow skin that replicates function of tissue for first time    The most impressive results came when the scientists applied the film to under-eye bags, the flaccid skin that can appear under the eye, particularly in older people. By compressing the loose skin, the polymer film improved the appearance of the eye bag to a level that had only been achieved before with invasive surgery. Next, the scientists gently pinched the under-eye skin and showed that the coating made the skin spring back into position much faster. The researchers went on to test whether the layer improved the elasticity of skin elsewhere and showed that skin recoiled more quickly from pinching on the forearm. Skin loses its elasticity with age, so restoring its stretchiness makes it appear younger. In a final test, the film proved its ability to prevent moisture loss on patches of dry skin. \u201cThere are some beneficial effects on fine lines and wrinkles and eye bags,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cIt provides some structural support, so to me it looks like it\u2019s smoothing things out.\u201d Anderson said he had not tested second skin on his face to see what people made of it, but instead chose to check how it behaved on his forearm. \u201cI\u2019ve never tried it to improve my cosmetic appearance. I gave up on that a long time ago,\u201d he said. Would second skin have any other uses, such as hiding a beer belly? \u201cWell, not this version,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hope we can figure that out.\u201d",
