  "body": "Selima Hill begins her new book with a flourish: To the Woman with the Long Black Hairwho may or may not want to be dedicated tobut to whom I am going to dedicate this anyway The dedication seems good-humoured, if defiant, and foreshadows an important quest for the narrator of these vivid, undeluded poems \u2013 to emerge from the solipsism of mental trauma and form connections with that notoriously hellish breed, \u201cother people\u201d. The inpatient\u2019s view of the psychiatric hospital as a theatre of abuse is a staple of Hill\u2019s imagination. The family and society sometimes operate in similarly coercive manner. Poetry is the defence of the private, \u201ctrue\u201d self. As the latter is tamed \u2013 by routines, drugs, therapies and the enforced communal interactions of every day \u2013 poems break out, earthy and surreal, emblems of suppressed authenticity. In this new exploration of the intractable conflict, Hill\u2019s playfulness has not deserted her, but her anger has been honed. Her narrator is often bracingly outspoken: \u201cWe\u2019re not lazy, we are tranquillised, / and neither are we \u2018bored\u2019, we are suffering.\u201d (Tranquillity).   Related: Poetry expresses what it is to be human \u2013 it\u2019s therapy for the soul | Adam O\u2019Riordan    Hill\u2019s menageries have delighted readers over the years: her animal characters bring a major English tradition of children\u2019s writing into adult poetry, glittering with X-certificate sexuality. Here, there are brief encounters with eels, owls, jellyfish, and some agreeable headlice, rejoicing in the absence of neurotypical censure from their innocent life cycle: \u201cto never not be normal must be bliss\u201d. A rubber zebra makes several mysterious appearances: in fact, it\u2019s the word \u201czebra\u201d that teaches the speaker to accept her own intellectual truth: \u201cBeing loved is good. It\u2019s what we want. / But secretly I prefer spelling.\u201d Another mode of self-realisation is metamorphosis: the obedient patient evades the doctor by becoming \u201csomeone else entirely / who sleeps in fins and spends the whole night swimming\u201d. (Dr D.) In The Day-room the sufferer compares her silence to that of \u201ca fire alarm / whose silence is a kind of thwarted ringing\u201d. It\u2019s a stunning simile, revealing how elective mutism contains a repressed fury of communication. Hill\u2019s narrator isn\u2019t concerned with the retrieval of mere \u201cnormality\u201d, but of utterance. The demand that her own uniqueness be recognised involves an obligation to recognise that of others, exchanging self-protective isolation for conversation and kindness. In spite of herself, she watches and notices people. When, in The End of the World, an irritating fellow patient says she wants to be friends, the initial rage (\u201c\u2013 excuse me, / never mention friends in here, OK?\u201d) gives way to grumpy acknowledgement of the comforts of social interaction: \u201cbut when I get too bored of despising her / I\u2019ll go and talk her through her various pills\u201d. \u201cThe Woman with Long Black Hair\u201d appears in a poem of the same title, placed almost halfway through the book. More animal than woman, she has \u201chairy legs she kicked the doctor with\u201d. Although the narrator knows that the new patient will come to smell the same as the doctor (a fine metaphor of institutionalisation) the image of that transgressive rebuttal seems to energise her own recovery. The animal-woman\u2019s anarchic bravery provides a link in the evolution of these terse, tough couplet-poems, which are the narrator\u2019s own kicks against hierarchy, gender stereotype and the false walls between people. The collection\u2019s title is not ironical. There is magnitude and sublimity in this latest chronicle of a long, hard pilgrimage to inner freedom.
