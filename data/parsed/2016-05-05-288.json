And deadpan comic Louis van Gaal has had them rolling in the aisles with some cracking observational material about sex, the poor man\u2019s Amy Schumer right on top of his game. Everything\u2019s going swimmingly at Old Trafford right now, which may explain why the club have asked Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to hang around like a spare part for 12 months while Van Gaal sees out his contract. Mourinho, needless to say, wants the job now. There\u2019ll be tears, and more leaks, before bedtime.

The west London spendthrifts will whittle away \u00a342m on the Napoli striker Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. They\u2019re also after Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s man of the moment Antoine Griezmann, who will cost a further \u00a379m. In a not-particularly-convincing sop to the reining-in of needless expenditure, they\u2019ll also ask Juan Cuadrado to return from a loan spell at Juventus, while keeping hold of April-to-May scoring sensation Eden Hazard. The champions Leicester \u2013 it\u2019s a satisfying phrase to read after paragraphs about megaclub Manchester United, a \u00a3121m Chelsea spree, and the wants and desires of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, isn\u2019t it? \u2013 are in the market for Thorgan Hazard, Eden\u2019s brother, currently roaming the midfield for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. Tottenham Hotspur, having just lost the title and in real danger of somehow managing to let Arsenal overtake them into second place, are probably best served dreaming about next season now. Here comes Moussa Konat\u00e9, who has scored 24 goals in 46 matches for Sion, and is available for a bargain \u00a36m. That\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it. And Arsenal have to go to Manchester City at the weekend, so perhaps that\u2019s not such a big worry after all. Gus Poyet will become the 17th man in 23 years to follow in Brian Clough\u2019s footsteps at Nottingham Forest. Seventeen managers in 23 years! Admittedly it was always going to be a tall order, but even so. And Barcelona are interested in the Newcastle United striker Ayoze P\u00e9rez, which shows you how good things can happen when you listen to wise old Rafa.",
