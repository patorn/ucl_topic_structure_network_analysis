  "body": "UK tax officials must \u201curgently\u201d liaise with the French authorities to see if they have evidence of wrongdoing by Google that relates to the company\u2019s UK tax affairs, John McDonnell has said. The shadow chancellor has written to George Osborne urging him to get any relevant information from France. HM Revenue and Customs has hinted it could revisit Google\u2019s tax settlement, initially hailed by the chancellor as a \u201cmajor success\u201d in January but widely criticised since, if new material comes to light from European investigations. Osborne is facing fresh taunts from Labour about the tax settlement, following a dawn raid on the internet company\u2019s Paris headquarters on Tuesday as part of a French investigation.   Related: Google offices raided in Paris as prosecutors announce fraud probe    In the letter, McDonnell asked if HMRC had approached French counterparts.\u201cI\u2019m sure that you now regret labelling the UK tax deal agreed with Google as \u2018a major success\u2019 as independent tax experts have consistently branded the deal as \u2018disproportionately small\u2019 ever since and in comparison to deals struck with other countries we\u2019re clearly losing out,\u201d he wrote.  \u201cWith the spotlight back on Google\u2019s tax affairs after ... [the] raid in Paris, will you reassure the British people that this government is serious about tackling tax avoidance by urgently getting in touch with the French authorities to find out if anything they\u2019ve uncovered ... is relevant to any wrongdoing that could have taken place in the UK?\u201d A group of 100 French tax investigators, magistrates and IT experts descended on Google\u2019s Paris offices to seize documents and computer files. Following a formal complaint by the French government, which believes it is owed \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn), the country\u2019s financial prosecutor says it suspects Google of aggravated financial fraud and money laundering. Labour and the Scottish National party rounded on Osborne on Wednesday, with the shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, accusing the chancellor of being \u201cfar too easily satisfied\u201d with the sums extracted from Google. During prime minister\u2019s questions, when Osborne stood in for David Cameron and Eagle deputised for Jeremy Corbyn, she asked: \u201cGiven the overnight news of the French authorities\u2019 dawn raid on Google investigating allegations of aggravated financial fraud and money laundering, does the chancellor now regret calling his cosy little tax deal with the same company good news for the British taxpayer?\u201d She added: \u201cHe will be judged on results. He\u2019s been in office for six years. With France demanding 10 times more from Google than he is, the public will make their own judgment.\u201d           George Osborne and Angela Eagle clash at PMQs    Critics say that in the 2005 to 2015 period covered by the settlement, the Californian technology group paid just 3% tax on its real profits. Google minimised its reported profits and therefore its tax bills in the UK, France, Italy and other major European markets by collecting money from advertisers through an Irish subsidiary. Osborne insisted the deal with HMRC had been a good one for taxpayers. \u201cIt is good news that we are collecting money in tax from companies that paid no tax when the Labour party was in office,\u201d he said. Despite Osborne\u2019s introduction of the so-called Google tax \u2013 new rules intended to ensure businesses are taxed according to how much revenue they generate in the UK \u2013 the company has taken no public steps to stop diverting revenues to Ireland. \u201cThis issue is not going away any time soon,\u201d said Caroline Flint, the former Labour minister and member of parliament\u2019s public accounts committee. \u201cAfter the feeble agreement between HMRC and Google it would be a huge embarrassment for the chancellor if the UK had to launch a new investigation arising from the actions of the French following allegations of suspected money laundering.\u201d Flint\u2019s committee intends to question HMRC bosses on 13 June regarding its record on customer service. Its chair, the Labour MP Meg Hillier, said she would use the hearing to check whether the tax office has requested a copy of the information which led to the French raid.   Related: George Osborne's new financial year gets off to 'a disappointing start'    HMRC\u2019s settlement with Google has been heavily criticised for a lack of transparency. Tax rulings are regarded as private, both for individuals and companies, and current policy is that the details are not made public. Margaret Hodge, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on responsible taxation, said: \u201cThis makes the case more than anything that we\u2019ve got to have transparency. What the government are doing is making a mockery of the law, because the law says we will be treated equally and yet they are encouraging multinationals to be treated preferentially. They are getting HMRC to turn a blind eye.\u201d Alyn Smith, an SNP member of the European parliament, wrote to Europe\u2019s competition commissioner earlier this year to request a full investigation into the settlement between HMRC and Google. \u201cWe are seeing on the big complex tax stuff, HMRC is clearly getting a political steer not to go after multinationals in the way that it needs to,\u201d he said. HMRC can reopen settlements where it discovers facts have been withheld or misrepresented. The tax office declined to say whether it would request information from French magistrates, citing rules on confidentiality.  In a statement, HMRC said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on identifiable taxpayers. HMRC works closely with other tax authorities, including exchanging information and best practice regarding the tax compliance of multinationals. \u201cWe are clear that multinational companies must pay the tax that is due and we do not accept less. Last year our compliance activities yielded \u00a326bn in extra tax, including \u00a37.3bn from the largest and most complex businesses.\u201d",
