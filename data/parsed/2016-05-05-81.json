  "body": "\u201cMy body feels great and my mind is refreshed,\u201d Alex Corbisiero says on a sleepy Monday morning in Cobham. Mondays are usually days etched in pain for rugby players. An international prop like Corbisiero is more often seen shuffling around a training ground in the hope that, by the time he plays again the following weekend, he will not feel like an old man who has been hit by a bus. Corbisiero is not recovering from yet another brutal game of rugby. Instead, he is replenishing himself after a decade as a professional \u2013 by taking a year out of the sport in order to save his career from being battered into early oblivion.   Related: England rugby squad\u2019s workload puts welfare at risk, warns players\u2019 union    \u201cI\u2019ve had 14 weeks off and feel really good,\u201d Corbisiero says as he reflects on the benefits of his brave and unpaid sabbatical. \u201cI was physically and mentally spent after 10 years of full-time rugby. The intensity, the physicality, the injuries and the pressure I put on myself took its toll. I knew if I wanted to play rugby again I had to stop for a while.\u201d Corbisiero is only 27 and whenever his name pops into my head I think of his colossal presence during the third Test between the British and Irish Lions and Australia less than three years ago. That evening in Sydney, Corbisiero demolished the Australian scrum so thoroughly that his opposite number, Ben Alexander, was substituted. Alexander had dominated Mako Vunipola the previous week, when Corbisiero was injured and the Lions lost, and so his humiliation was striking. Corbisiero also scored the opening try and produced many big hits and carries in a man-of-the-match performance. The England prop should now be at his peak and one of the most influential forwards in world rugby. And so his self-imposed exile for a year is a warning that professional rugby cannot expect its players to withstand such sustained physicality season after season. Corbisiero is intelligent and educated \u2013 with the prop forward\u2019s innate suspicion of sensationalism. He makes it plain that this interview should not be seen as an embittered lament. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019re hard done by,\u201d he stresses. \u201cThere are so many great things about being a rugby player. I am hugely grateful each time I sign a new contract. I also know there is always a risk of injury and head trauma. But we need to look after our players in the here and now. We also need to be proactive in looking after them in the long term.\u201d Corbisiero had hoped to play until the end of this season before beginning his break but his club, Northampton Saints, felt it was in their joint interests to part soon after he told them his plans. He was upset at the time but, now, is relaxed about the club\u2019s decision.

They don\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers. I respect that. If you\u2019re a dad then family is your priority. But I am sure the kids of that player want him being able to walk around rather than hobbling when he is 50 or getting dementia early. \u201cI am ready to talk because I want rugby to change. I want us to look after players by talking about it, listening to each other and having a united front. Lots of guys have said to me, off the record: \u2018Well done, mate. You\u2019ve done the right thing. I wish I could do the same but I\u2019ve got family, kids, a mortgage and it\u2019s not feasible.\u2019 Some of the older generation were caught off-guard and said: \u2018Really? You\u2019re not just retiring and don\u2019t want to say it?\u2019 I say: \u2018No, mate. I want to come back and play great rugby.\u2019 But I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the support from my contemporaries. They\u2019ve made a tough time much easier.\u201d Rugby players are conditioned to exude strength. It is not easy for them to admit frailty in a ferocious professional sport. \u201cEven now people will frown if you say you need a rest or can\u2019t train in the week. There\u2019s still a stigma about it.\u201d Did Corbisiero accept this culture of silence? \u201cMassively. I should have said: \u2018I need to rest this injury before it goes too far.\u2019 But I pushed myself and kept quiet. There\u2019s so much at stake and players soldier on or strap up. But we\u2019ve reached a point where we need to respect guys who don\u2019t play when they\u2019re hurt. It takes courage to say you are not right. But the repercussions can be serious. You might play one \u2018vital\u2019 match and end up missing six months.\u201d Did he talk to his coaches? \u201cYeah. As I accumulated more wear-and-tear and my injuries became more apparent I couldn\u2019t do every session or play 38 games straight. I had to be more vocal about my need to be better managed. At first there was resistance. Sometimes [his first club] London Irish were good, or Saints were good, England too, but there were times when they needed you and it didn\u2019t matter how you felt. You had to go out and do it. When the pressure is on, it doesn\u2019t matter if you need a rest or are hurting. It\u2019s a results business and the team has to succeed. Their jobs are on the line and that defines decisions many times.\u201d Did Corbisiero start games when already injured? \u201cThere were so many times I should not have played. I wouldn\u2019t say I felt forced but I felt pressure to play and to \u2018soldier up\u2019. I ended up doing more damage which I regret now. If I had been smarter I would\u00a0have played lots more games over my 10 years.\u201d Are players discouraged when coaching staff don\u2019t always listen? \u201cExactly. You also get frustrated when filling out these \u2018Wellness\u2019 questionnaires. You can\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019m feeling rubbish\u2019 because they\u2019ve just said: \u2018We need you.\u2019 I\u2019m not pointing the finger at anyone. It\u2019s just the system. The reality is that as long as you\u2019re walking and able they expect you to play. You also have pride. My best games were for coaches who invested in me, and I invested in them. So the emotional side of you wants to be there for them.\u201d Do some coaches dislike players who ask for a break? \u201cYeah, there are a few coaches. I don\u2019t want to name names but it\u2019s come up a few times in my career. Even though the medics have made the call there are plenty of coaches who, deep down, resent the fact that you\u2019re not playing.\u201d Do coaches and doctors ever argue about a player\u2019s fitness? \u201cThere are discussions. \u2018Can we do this? Can we see how it goes?\u2019 Some medics stand firm. There are tons of examples where a \u2018no\u2019 is a \u2018no\u2019. But, in a grey area, my experience is that the decision leans towards the player playing.\u201d Medics are employed by a club or the RFU. \u201cExactly. It\u2019s tough for them. Their role is to do what\u2019s best for us medically. At the same time they need to help the team. A lot of time what\u2019s best for the player and what\u2019s best for the team is so far apart that a conflict is inevitable. Medics try to look after the player but there is pressure on them. Lots of players come back too soon quite regularly. That\u2019s the ruthless reality of professional sport.\u201d   Related: Rugby union\u2019s brutal reality: the physical and mental toll of an elite playing career | Michael Aylwin    Corbisiero is heartened by the \u201csmall victories\u201d the players\u2019 union [the RPA] has won in regard, for example, to a longer off-season. But such steps do not go far enough in safeguarding player welfare. \u201cWe have a mandatory five-week break coming in \u2013 that\u2019s great. Usually it\u2019s three weeks if you\u2019re an international. If you\u2019ve got three weeks then it\u2019s really only a week completely off. You need to come back into the club in pre-season and they\u2019ll do your skinfolds. They\u2019ll measure your fitness levels. If they\u2019re appalling there are repercussions. You never really switch-off. \u201cThe accumulative wear-and-tear worries me. Maro Itoje is a superstar at 21 and we need to make sure that in six years, at his peak, he\u2019s fresh enough to be physically imposing. He\u2019s a phenomenal player but we can\u2019t have him being run into the ground by playing 30-odd games every season. Same as George North. He\u2019s 24 and playing Tests since he was 18 \u2013 without a proper break. We have to look after these great players.\u201d The current amount of games a player is allowed to participate in during a season stands at 32 \u2013 but Corbisiero makes a key distinction. \u201cIt depends on individuals and positions. You wouldn\u2019t really want your props playing more than 25 games a year. I would say, roughly, 25 games with around 60 minutes on the field per match is right for a prop.\u201d Yet the administrators are riding a commercial wave which depends on games being played to meet the interests of broadcasters and sponsors. \u201cRugby is huge business now. This season, because of the World Cup, they only took out the LV Cup. The schedule has meant you just go through 28 straight Premiership and European games. There are no \u2018lesser\u2019 LV Cup games, no rest weeks. It\u2019s unbelievable. That decision was driven by profits. Player welfare was not considered. That shows the business side prevails.\u201d There is also concern about the amount of contact players endure in training. \u201cWe should have limits on contact,\u201d Corbisiero says. \u201cIn the NFL, once the [American football] season starts, you can\u2019t have contact in the week except for a couple of times a season. But look at their player power [in terms of standing up to administrators]. It\u2019s huge compared to ours.\u201d    When people say you are going to be fine you want to believe them and so you crack on. I paid the price       When his body did not feel ravaged Corbisiero enjoyed some amazing highlights \u2013 from that Lions series victory in Australia to beating New Zealand in his last start for England in 2012. \u201cWhen I was healthy I had some incredible highs. I was really proud of some of my games and the standards I set. I was right up there. But being injured so often was very difficult mentally. \u201cEven against the All Blacks I shouldn\u2019t have played against them or South Africa the week before. I was out the next five months. I\u2019d just come back from my first major knee surgery and it flared up again. In hindsight I should have pulled back rather than playing on a dodgy knee. I was buggered \u2013 even before South Africa. But when people say you are going to be fine you want to believe them and so you crack on. I paid the price.\u201d     England\u2019s prop Alex Corbisiero is tackled by South Africa\u2019s flanker Willem Alberts during the Springboks\u2019 16-15 victory at Twickenham in November 2012. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images    Interviewing Corbisiero is a treat. I enjoy hearing him talk about his hobby, rapping, why he loves NWA\u2019s Straight Outta Compton and his fascination with Conor McGregor. We speak for a long time but, Straight Outta Cobham in the end, cannot help returning to rugby. Corbisiero has not lost his passion for the game. \u201cI can feel the itch to come back \u2013 even if it\u2019s not burning red-hot quite yet. The plan is to start training hard in November and be playing again next January.\u201d His international ambitions remain. \u201cI\u2019ve only met Eddie Jones in passing and he was very nice. He said: \u2018You\u2019re too good not to play, mate.\u2019 I said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be back.\u2019\u201d There are more important battles to be won for the sake of all rugby players. \u201c100%. Many players share my mindset in regard to the culture of the game. But they need more power. They need to be more vocal and trust each other. If everyone supports the guy who says it\u2019s not right to play when injured there is more chance of hearing him. Otherwise he will feel like the black sheep or an anomaly. \u201cWe need a united front to get this message to resonate. We need to keep focusing on player welfare. We need to keep an eye on the number of games players have, the training load, the amount of contact they\u2019re doing, the off-season they get, their insurance. We\u00a0need to stick together to bring about\u00a0change \u2013 otherwise it will never get done.\u201d",
