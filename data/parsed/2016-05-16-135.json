  "body": "In Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes\u2019 Daphne\u2019s Dive, home is where you drain your Heineken. Set almost exclusively within a grubby corner bar (credit set designer Donyale Werle with the creaky stools and begrimed linoleum), the drama concerns Daphne, the no-nonsense barkeep, and the regulars who talk, dance and drink there from the naughty 90s through the more sober 00s.  Some playwrights reinvent themselves with every text, exploring new worlds, themes and styles. This isn\u2019t Hudes\u2019 way. Like her Elliot Trilogy (whose middle play, Water by the Spoonful won a Pulitzer prize), Daphne\u2019s Dive returns to North Philadelphia and also centers on family \u2013 both inherited and improvised. As in Hudes\u2019 other mostly naturalistic plays, it is about the ways in which we seek connection with the people around us, sometimes finding it, sometimes failing it.   The play begins in 1994 as Daphne (Vanessa Aspillaga, conserving some of her natural buoyancy) is readying the bar for the day. A Puerto Rican immigrant, she lives alone, managing the bar and the apartments upstairs. She tolerates mildly quarrelsome visits with her nouveau riche sister (a splendid Daphne Rubin-Vega in a variety of wigs) and gentle badinage with the bikers, rebels and rascals who fill her tables. Daphne isn\u2019t consciously eager for closer relationships \u2013 when a patron asks her if she\u2019s gay or straight, she responds, \u201cI\u2019m Catholic\u201d \u2013 but she decides to adopt the daughter of former tenants (Samira Wiley of Orange is the New Black, who ages from 11 to 29), when she learns that the girl has suffered abuse.  The structure of Daphne\u2019s Dive, as directed by Hamilton hotshot Thomas Kail, is unhelpfully looser than in past plays, yet Hudes has always favored dividing the focus among a varied group of people, as in her Tony-nominated book for the first Lin-Manuel Miranda musical, In the Heights. Here, the characterizations feel a little schematic. These are not stock figures certainly \u2013 stock figures don\u2019t claim to be \u201cmore Puerto Rican than a crucifix on the rearview\u201d \u2013 but not as richly textured as they might be, though the more expert actors, like Rubin-Vega and Matt Saldivar, as an affable Cuban American artist, can do a lot to mitigate this. And Hudes\u2019 extraordinary sincerity \u2013 another hallmark of her work \u2013 can sometimes come across as naivet\u00e9, although it isn\u2019t quite.   But if the plotting and characterizations don\u2019t quite prop up the bar, there\u2019s an unassailable heart to Hudes\u2019 work \u2013 a fierce compassion for the people she creates and an equally ardent love for the ethnically and culturally diverse city that raised her. Daphne\u2019s Dive isn\u2019t so much a melting pot as it is the rum punch that Daphne offers, in which the separate flavors mingle, but remain somehow distinct. It\u2019s worth downing.   The headline and standfirst of this article were amended on 17 May 2016; the play is set in North Philadelphia, not New York.",
