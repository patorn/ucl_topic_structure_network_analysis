  "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said the Europa League final arrives at the \u201cperfect moment\u201d in Liverpool\u2019s development and claimed his players can become Anfield legends with victory against Sevilla.   Related: J\u00fcrgen Klopp out to end his losing streak as Liverpool seek Europa League glory | Andy Hunter    Liverpool, three-time winners of the Uefa Cup, are attempting to win the trophy for a fourth time on Wednesday in Basel, having reserved their strongest performances of Klopp\u2019s seven-month tenure for a tournament that offers automatic entry into the group stage of the Champions League. Only victory at St Jakob-Park will deliver European football next season for Liverpool. Their manager, who may include the fit-again Divock Origi in his 18-man squad, believes an arduous Premier League campaign will provide invaluable experience for Liverpool in their first European final since 2007. Klopp said before February\u2019s Capital One Cup final that he did not know which Liverpool side would show against Manchester City. Now he has complete trust in his players as they attempt to halt Sevilla\u2019s push for a third straight Europa League title. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cWe are here because we beat Dortmund? Right. We beat Man United? Right. And Villarreal? Right. In my opinion we are really in a perfect moment to play a final. That doesn\u2019t mean all is already done. No, it\u2019s far away from this. It\u2019s only about the preparation. \u201cThis hard, intensive seven months feels like it should end in a final. Always working for each point, each goal and each opportunity in the game; good performances, bad performances. At the end you have a final. It\u2019s about being able to show all the things you have learned. I\u2019m really happy. Usually the problem for all teams is that a final is the last game of the season so it has been a long time until then. But nobody feels the intensity of the Premier League season in this moment. We have the breath of fresh air.\u201d Klopp made frequent reference to last week\u2019s Premier League game against Chelsea in the buildup to this final. The manager fielded what may prove his starting lineup against Sevilla in the 1-1 draw at Anfield, and described the Chelsea display as educational for Basel. \u201cThere is no doubt about our quality at this moment, no doubt about the opportunity we have,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are very, very deserved to be in this final. We will be a real competitor. That\u2019s all we can be. I am quite sure with all the things we did until now, all the ups and downs we had, and even with a position of eighth in the league there have been ups, it\u2019s the best moment to play a final. Everything is prepared. \u201cThe Chelsea game was very, very, very important because it showed we are in a really good moment but we still need to do the right things in the right moment. For the first 15 minutes it looked too easy and you thought: \u2018Oh my God, what\u2019s happening here?\u2019 Warming up was the same \u2013 unbelievable. But after the first 15 minutes, like very often in life, we got the bill for taking the wrong decisions. That\u2019s good. We can use this. It will help us for being really ready for the final.\u201d Basel represents Sevilla\u2019s fifth European final in 11 years. The Andalucians have won four of the past 10 Europa League or Uefa Cup finals, whereas no Liverpool player has won a continental trophy with the club. But Klopp is confident the incentive to earn a place in Anfield folklore outweighs any relative inexperience on his players\u2019 part.   Related: The secret behind Sevilla\u2019s success? Meet Monchi, the transfer wizard    \u201cFor sure it will be one of the greatest things up until now in their careers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if someone has won a bigger title before?\u201d Informed that James Milner and Kolo Tour\u00e9 have won the Premier League and Daniel Sturridge the Champions League, Klopp said: \u201cOK, but that is not a lot. \u201cYou win it, you get it and you are then a European champion or whatever but you have to work with it. Of course it gives confidence but you have to use the confidence in the right way. If it is the end of the development it is clear it is only in one direction \u2013 down. But we are far away from the end of a development, we are still developing. \u201cIt is a very important stage but we can do better. In any part of life it feels wonderful to be champion. It is a wonderful story to tell your grandchildren when you are old about being a Liverpool legend. How it feels to be a Liverpool legend I have no idea but it must be one of the best things you can feel in football. I would be really pleased for the boys if they can do it.\u201d",
