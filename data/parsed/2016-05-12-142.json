  "body": "When Sally Mortimore joined social work service provider Aidhour as director in April 2014, times were tough. The company had enjoyed a boom in contracts between 1998 and 2011 but started to lack investment following the sudden death of a previous director. It provided just two services to local authorities \u2013 independent reviewing officers (special social workers who reviewed and looked after children\u2019s cases) and children\u2019s advocacy services. That left it little room to manoeuvre during a time when cash-strapped councils were terminating contracts and bringing services in-house. Mortimore, who has 20 years\u2019 experience in social work, was determined to turn the company around. \u201cChildren in care can feel disenfranchised and unheard. I felt Aidhour\u2019s concept was worth investing in. So I put together a cunning plan to help us move forward.\u201d Her first actions were to overhaul the company\u2019s IT systems, create a new up-to-date website and develop a social media presence to bring the company into the digital marketplace. Then she set about realising her vision. \u201cI wanted to develop a model of working that was different and more business-like, drawing together a group of hand-picked, highly experienced social work professionals that would deliver high-quality, cost-effective services.\u201d These are the Aidhour associates \u2013 self-employed managers, social workers, advocates and regulatory inspectors, hired by Aidhour for specific projects and tasks. They are paid an hourly rate, which is charged back, plus a management fee, to clients. There are now 46 associates, all with significant post-qualifying and management experience. Providing just two services was unsustainable: Aidhour needed to diversify. \u201cWith a long career in social care management under my belt, I knew the market well,\u201d says Mortimore. \u201cSo I started looking at what more the associates could offer, involving them in service development and trawling the internet and social work recruitment and tendering sites.  \u201cI also began actively recruiting to engage more associates with specific skills and experience along lines of identified need. At that time, children\u2019s homes regulations changed and organisations that ran residential care establishments needed to find independent people to review the care that they provided to children.  \u201cWe now review 16 homes, with another six in the pipeline, and have engaged four associates to provide the service.\u201d Her plan is working. Over the past year, Aidhour has bid for six local authority tenders and won five. She attributes her success to her background in children\u2019s services. \u201cI understand exactly what is required and what commissioners are looking for in a project,\u201d says Mortimore. \u201cBeing so close to the frontline, I understand what our clients need and I understand their financial pressures.\u201d These new contracts mean that a surplus of just \u00a37,936 in September 2015 has grown to \u00a325,609 six months later, allowing the organisation to begin marketing its services to a wider audience with a new website and brochure.  Associate director Robert Bradshaw, who nominated Mortimore, says she\u2019s transformed Aidhour. \u201cSally is warm, she is caring, and she\u2019s not afraid to be hands-on \u2013 if an associate is ill, for example, she\u2019ll go and see the family and do the assessment herself. She\u2019s always on the other end of the phone if you need advice, and she\u2019s always around just for a tea and a chat. She\u2019s got a great sense of humour, which helps when you\u2019re working in a stressful environment. \u201cPlus, she makes everyone else in Aidhour feel like they\u2019re the leaders. That, in turn, enables us to do the same with local authority children\u2019s services departments, helping them to identify where they want to get to and giving them the support they need to get there.\u201d  Sally Mortimore was shortlisted in the Small Business Showcase competition\u2019s Leader of the Year category.
