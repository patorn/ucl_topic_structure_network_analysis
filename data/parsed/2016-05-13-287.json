One friend who had just come back from aid work in the Middle East was particularly incensed. She kept going on about a story they had run about a freakish goat-eating python that had been found in central Asia.  \u201cAll the news that is happening in the world and they run the python.\u201d They ran the python because people wanted the python. People say they want world news and politics but they really want a freaky goat-eating python \u2013 that\u2019s what I learned during my year on the tabloid treadmill at Ninemsn, then Australia\u2019s most popular news website. This week comes the news that in June, after 19 years, Ninemsn will be no longer. It will be rebranded as Nine.com.au and \u2013 one would presume \u2013 reflect the conservative, family friendly Nine brand more closely than Ninemsn did.   Related: Celebrities protest at 'crazy' redundancy of Age arts critic    Ninemsn reflected Australia\u2019s id and the id wasn\u2019t always pretty. Its attention flowed more towards pictures of pretty young women in peril than stories about poverty in Indigenous communities. But if that\u2019s what punters wanted, then that\u2019s what they got.  The website was totally apolitical and without agenda. The only thing it bowed to was traffic. And that is why it was number one for so long. In real time, every day, it continually bent like a reed to its audience and their tastes. At first, I tried to sneak various \u201cisms\u201d into the site. It never worked. The site was an \u201cism\u201d free zone. The first Trojan horse was feminism. It was my first day on the job as deputy news editor and in conference we were discussing a story about a woman being thrown off a flight for having sex in her seat. \u201cSurely she wasn\u2019t having sex by herself. She was with a man, right? Why aren\u2019t we doing a story on the man?\u201d I would learn that we would do a story on the man, if the man rated well. We would do a story on the seat, if the seat rated well. But Australia\u2019s id \u2013 its pleasure principle \u2013 revealed time and time again that readers would rather read about an attractive woman having sex on a plane than read about the man she was having sex with (unless he was a celebrity or there was something unusual about him, like if he was 110 years old). I was quickly told in no uncertain terms that I was not to disrespect or judge the readers. They were always right, and if you understand what they want and put up stories that are informative and entertaining, they will click. And if they click, you win. Based on traffic, readers liked the following: stories about brides, stories about brides in peril, stories about bad bridal wear, tattoos gone wrong, Photoshop gone wrong, plus-sized models, crime stories (particularly gruesome crimes), local crime stories, stories about politics where something actually happens (so if a prime minister is toppled, rather than just speculation that it might happen), people killed or maimed by claw hammers, stories about Josef Fritzl, other stories about people locked in dungeons, freaky animal stories, funny viral videos, stories about Australian television celebrities, stories about celebrities that have died. I had lunch with my former Ninemsn editor this week and we spent the hour reminiscing. \u201cRemember the video of the smoking toddler?\u201d \u201cYeah, that was great. Remember the woman who choked her kid with pages from the bible?\u201d \u201cRemember the chick-chick boom girl?\u201d \u2013 which turned out to be a hoax.  In morning conference, if someone pitched an idea that was \u201cstale\u201d my editor would pick up a loudspeaker and activate a shrill and annoying air raid siren. He looks suddenly wistful at the demise of the brand: \u201cIt was a distorted, crazy, fun house mirror, a look into Australia\u2019s subconscious, the good and the bad.\u201d And weird. Along with celebrity deaths and leadership spills, any evidence of the divine and life beyond death rated hugely. \u201cRemember angels, that guy who was dying and saw a halo by his bed? That did well for us. Angels were golden,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd anytime someone found evidence of Jesus in a piece of burnt toast. That did well. \u201d Jesus toast. Those were the days.  There was something fast, dirty, exhilarating and strange about working on an online tabloid news website that was entirely responsive to its audience. All editors had a screen that gave almost real time audience responses to a story (but you had to keep refreshing it). \u201cDrop the thing on Kevin Rudd\u2019s speech \u2013 it\u2019s stinking up the site!\u201d would be shouted at you by someone monitoring the analytics, while you\u2019d be searching frantically for another more \u201cclickable\u201d story.  Some days I was so desperate for a story our readers would like, I would type \u201cgruesome\u201d or \u201cbride\u201d into a Google news search and find a \u201cgruesome\u201d or \u201cbride\u201d story somewhere in the back blocks of Virginia, Ukraine, China or Indonesia and put that on the site. Then I\u2019d sit back and watch the traffic soar.  I changed shape while running on the tabloid treadmill, I was drinking the Kool Aid.  And it appeared that this didn\u2019t go unnoticed:  Dear Brig, Worst headlines ever, Cheeseball murder, Floury buns, Gloomy roomy. You must be on duty. Love MUMXXXXXXXX  Cheeseball was the murder in which a woman rammed a car into a young man who had been throwing cheeseball snacks at her. Floury buns was about a baker accused of sexually harassing female staff by putting his (flour-dusted) hands on her backside.  Gloomy roomy was a man who killed his roommate, who was a hoarder. \u201cWe weren\u2019t cool, like Buzzfeed,\u201d says my lunch companion, sadly. \u201cBut we did first what Buzzfeed are doing \u2013 high and low, silly and serious.\u201d  We both now work in newsrooms where \u201cisms\u201d are encouraged \u2013 and luckily for me, Jesus toast stories are still aired occasionally.",
