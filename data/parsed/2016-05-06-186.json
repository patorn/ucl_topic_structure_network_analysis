  "body": "The track I\u2019ll be opening my next DJ set with Sebastien Bouchet: Coyote Cry I really never plan what to play or how to start until I\u2019m just there, minutes from beginning my sets\u2026 But since you ask, I\u2019ll commit to open with this [unreleased] track. Amazing sonic journey, perfect to get in a certain mood; very few beats in it, very mysterious. The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor J\u00fcrgen Paape: Take That            A classic in my record case. It just has what it takes to be a game changer. The track that currently gets the most rewinds Rebolledo: Pow Pow I like to believe that this brings something fresh to the dancefloor. It\u2019s different from most tracks out there. The track that\u2019s been unfairly slept on this year Fango: Dritto (Rebolledo\u2019s Action sequence)             Maceo Plex \u201cshowed it to the world\u201d in one of his Boiler Room sessions last year. It has quite a lot of \u201chit\u201d elements but it has stayed a bit off the radar. The track I\u2019d play to show off my eclectic tastes            I\u2019m a very humble guy. Showing off is not part of my essence, and playing \u201cnot obvious\u201d dancefloor tracks has been always part of my style. But a good example of a bit more extreme track would be the Jimmy Castor Bunch\u2019s Troglodyte. It\u2019s a bomb. The track I wish I\u2019d never played I truly don\u2019t have one. I\u2019m not the kind of guy who would regret decisions like this, and if a track makes it to my record box, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot of thought behind it. The track that should have been a crossover hit Pachanga Boys: Legs            If the world was a fairer place and pop culture was not at the low point it is now, this could have been something for the masses. The cool masses. The track I\u2019d play at my auntie\u2019s wedding Donna Summer: I Feel Love            Timeless piece, still more modern than must of the music out there, older people love it, kids too and everybody in between. It\u2019s about love and gets the party going\u2026 just perfect. Disco is always a great wedding soundtrack. The ideal festival track Pachanga Boys: Time            Don\u2019t want to sound pretentious but it is\u2026 The track I\u2019d play at sunset in Ibiza Eurhythmics: Love is a Stranger            Just beautiful. The track I\u2019d play at my funeralBarnt: What Is A Number, That A Man May Know It?            It\u2019s a strong statement of power and pride and, at the same time, is sweet and melancholic. People attending might share a tear \u2013 I\u2019ve done it just by playing it \u2013 but will walk away looking forward to the future. Rebolledo plays The Berkeley Suite, Glasgow, Friday; XOYO, EC2, 21 May",
