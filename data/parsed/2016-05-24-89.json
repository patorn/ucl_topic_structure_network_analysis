  "body": "David Hartshorne, director at Dijitul, explains why Emma Hoskins should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:   Since joining the company, Emma has become the go-to person for the other members of staff, due to her in-depth knowledge of all of our products and services. The business has since grown around her exceptional eye for detail as well as her perfect customer service and sales skills.  She has excelled in every area possible, receiving a number of positive testimonials from clients who have been overwhelmed by her customer service and attitude.  Most people tend to shy away from extra work or learning new skills however Emma is always keen to learn. She is also the first point of call for anyone who contacts the company via telephone. She has great interpersonal skills and is always polite and well mannered. Many of our customers have commented on her polite and easy going demeanour, as well as her ability to provide help in a professional and concise manner.  Finally, what I would consider to be her most important skill, is her ability to do everything with a smile on her face and a brilliant positive attitude.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
