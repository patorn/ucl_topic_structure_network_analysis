The baby is covered in mysterious goo. It looks disgruntled and disgusted. It appears to scream, but then falls asleep. Meet infant actor J Doe, one of dozens of professional babies starring in movies and TV series every year. His special talents include crying, wrinkling face and being held.  Evan Goldberg, executive producer of the comedy Knocked Up, admitted over the phone that he couldn\u2019t remember who the baby was in the movie\u2019s birth scene. \u201cActually, we shot two endings \u2013 one with a girl, one with a boy. I think we ended up with the boy? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d The role went uncredited, which isn\u2019t unusual because infant actors don\u2019t have speaking parts and are therefore classified as background actors or extras. They\u2019re thrown in with the likes of \u201cGuy Walking Out of Starbucks #2\u201d. No one knows their names, and in exchange for being covered in mysterious substances for wanton nude scenes, history forgets them. Personally, the plight of tiny, barely sentient humans trying to make a name for themselves in Hollywood does not move me. But I do want to know what the goddamn goo is, what kind of crooked obstetrician monsters get paid off to peddle infant acting jobs in the post-natal unit, and what terrible things are done behind the scenes to make these babies cry so hard for birth scenes.    The stand-in doll on set was so realistic looking that it depressed people because it looked dead  Evan Goldberg     \u201cI don\u2019t think it works that way,\u201d Goldberg said after a long pause that implied my questions were weird. \u201cI think it\u2019s all very official. Our initial intention with Knocked Up was to film a live birth, but we found out we couldn\u2019t because the baby, by virtue of not being born yet, couldn\u2019t be a member of SAG. So we created a fake lower body of a woman with a head that came out to simulate crowning. There are a lot of regulations.\u201d Per usual, my questions are more macabre than their answers. Infant actors are well-protected; they can only work four hours per day; they can only shoot for 20 minutes of those hours. \u201cSo you have four infants, approximately the same age, same hair color, look enough alike that they can double each other,\u201d said Chris Riddle, an assistant director for film and television. \u201cYou use one baby for the first 20 minutes, a second baby for the next 20, etc. And if you\u2019re doing a shot where the baby isn\u2019t the focal point, or maybe it\u2019s just in a crib in the background, you use a doll.\u201d Clint Eastwood\u2019s decision to use a doll instead of a real baby for long scenes in American Sniper raised interesting questions about the role of newborn actors on sets. The movie quickly became legendary not only for its award-winning depiction of a sniper, but for the fact that Sienna Miller breastfed a doll.  Audiences were really disturbed by it; nothing distracts from the plot like Miller appearing to insert her nipple into the rigid, hole-mouth of one of those plastic, bottle-feeding, poop-and-pee babies.            Granted, the doll in question was not especially realistic (it looked like a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us clearance item) \u2013 but even if it had been, chances are we would have hated it even more.  The \u201cuncanny valley theory\u201d suggests that the more a non-human resembles a live human, the more relatable that non-human becomes \u2013 but only to a point. When the appearance gets too realistic, the theory goes, humans tend to feel repulsed (think CGI disasters like Polar Express.) Producer Evan Goldberg remembers one such doll, and it haunts him. \u201cThe stand-in doll on set was so realistic looking that it depressed people because it looked dead. Whenever we weren\u2019t using it, we had to get the props master to take it away and keep it away.\u201d Not looking dead is a huge part of infant acting. If one falls asleep, handlers aren\u2019t allowed to wake it, because that would be mean. Instead, a conscious back-up baby is swapped in. Daniel de Blanke, a freelance composer whose daughter has been working as a child actor for almost half her life (she\u2019s nine months old) says that \u201cnot being a big napper\u201d has given his daughter an edge in the business. (Her upcoming spots include a print ad and an online commercial for a rental hunting website). \u201cBeing physically awake during auditions is a big thing,\u201d he explained. The competition for jobs is fierce. Casting agents have access to thousands of baby extras via various talent agencies and casting sites. Parents like De Blanke sign up, post a picture of their kid, and wait.  Ben Patterson, who runs a digital music company in Los Angeles, is still waiting. He recently updated his eight-month-old\u2019s talent page to include skills such as \u201csits up, crawls, high fives\u201d. He remembers filling out generic forms that included questions like: \u201cWould you do nudity?\u201d \u201cWhich I guess Emmett would do,\u201d Patterson said, laughing. \u201cHe\u2019s nude a lot. He\u2019s a baby.\u201d Like most of the parents I spoke to, De Blanke and Patterson aren\u2019t after fame; they got their kids involved in background acting to start a college fund. \u201cIn California, with all under-18 actors you have to set up a Coogin Trust [a blocked trust account]. Any money that my daughter makes goes into that, and she gets it when she\u2019s 18.\u201d In general, the parents I talked to were relatively chill. But they had seen things. \u201cThe kids can do no wrong, they\u2019re babies \u2013 but the parents can,\u201d De Blanke said gravely. \u201cSometimes the parents get very upset [when their kid falls asleep and doesn\u2019t make it on-camera.] One dad was trying to wake his baby up.\u201d De Blanke also recalls being at an audition with \u201cone gentleman who told everyone his infant was either going to be a rock star, or a movie star. Those were the choices.\u201d            Fortunately, those in charge of casting have comparatively low expectations of babies. \u201cWhat you want for newborns is generally for them to do nothing,\u201d said Hartley Gorenstein, a producer whose recent credits include Room. I asked him about the goo. \u201cGoo?\u201d \u201cThe stuff that looks like vaginal discharge, on the babies \u2013 the post-birth stuff.\u201d To be more scientific and appropriate, I clarified that I meant the vernix caseosa, which is Latin for \u201ccheeselike varnish\u201d. \u201cI want to know about the cheeselike varnish,\u201d I said. \u201cHigh fructose corn syrup,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same sort of stuff we would use for blood if someone got shot.\u201d I relayed the question to my other sources and found that the substance varies set-to-set.    Everybody\u2019s metaphorically holding hands, looking at each other solemnly, like, \u2018Please don\u2019t let this baby shit itself'  Evan Goldberg     Jane Rogers, who does background casting for shows like Man Seeking Woman and often works with children, took time to emphasize the integrity of her goo. The goo is edible and gluten free \u2013 it is very LA. \u201cWe make sure that the goop they\u2019re covered in is organic, water soluble, non-toxic, la-la-la.\u201d \u201cWe put grape jelly and cream cheese on children for birthing scenes,\u201d Knocked Up\u2019s producer Evan Goldberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201d Then again, all of Hollywood is weird. Here, not even infants are immune to youth-driven beauty standards. This is the sort of place where you can always look younger, even if you\u2019ve just been born.  Jane Rogers explained to me that the reason casting agents go after twins or triplets isn\u2019t just to get lookalikes for the same character (thus making the most of each newborn\u2019s mandated 20 work minutes), but also because multiples are typically born premature. Soliciting premature babies, in other words, is a way to cast for age zero while sticking to SAG\u2019s 15-day-old age requirement. Ethics, requirements, rules \u2013 la-la-la. I was getting bored by how principled everyone was. Luckily, my questions about in-house methods for getting babies to cry prompted more mixed responses (take away a toy, take away the mother, \u201cit just happens\u201d).     Julianne Moore and Hugh Grant with what looks like a fake baby. Photograph: Allstar    My friend who writes for television claimed that once, when he was on set, they used baby wipes to do it. \u201cIt was upsetting,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t use my name.\u201d \u201cI think someone must\u2019ve discovered at some point that having this foreign object on their face makes them hysterical,\u201d he continued, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s uncomfortable or confusing? After a few takes, we didn\u2019t want to keep doing it. It left me with a bad feeling.\u201d I slogged on, hoping for darker tales of woe. But hypoallergenic baby wipes was the weirdest it got. According to everyone else, the real challenge is getting the baby to not cry. \u201cEverybody\u2019s metaphorically holding hands and looking at each other solemnly, like: \u2018Please don\u2019t let this baby cry and shit itself,\u2019\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cYou\u2019re ruled by tentative fear, because this kid can do whatever it wants. With [adult] actors, you have to deal with egos, strengths, weaknesses. With babies there\u2019s just one thing: don\u2019t cry.\u201d This, like raising a child, often takes a village. \u201cWhen babies are on set, everyone is behaving \u2013 top of their game \u2013 because if the kid starts crying, we\u2019re all fucked. It\u2019s funny to watch, like, a hundred people trying to be good parents, all at the same time.\u201d  \u201cMost recently, there was a day on Neighbors II,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe had the twins, Elise and Zoe, who play the kid, plus there were these toddlers \u2026 basically we had a handful of babies, and it was like playing with fire. The babies were crying, and everyone else on set was making farting noises \u2013 that was the only way to keep them smiling. And, keep in mind this is everyone\u2019s job, so they\u2019re taking the farting noises really seriously.\u201d I imagined a room full of adults, mouths numb from doing raspberries.  Tiny actors are paid in cash and rarely recognized when the credits roll, but during their 20 minutes in the spotlight, they are tiny kings and queens. Given how sensitive audiences are to the uncanny valley phenomenon, they might even have job security when the robots take over.",
