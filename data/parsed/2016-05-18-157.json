The shadow home secretary, who has been MP for Leigh in Greater Manchester for 15 years, said he would leave the Commons if he was elected, arguing that a \u201cLondoncentric\u201d Labour party must not repeat the mistakes that relegated it to third place in Scotland in this month\u2019s Holyrood elections. Arguing that Labour must field its \u201cbiggest names\u201d for mayoral jobs, Burnham said: \u201cThe mistake Labour made in Scotland was that when devolution came, we didn\u2019t field our biggest names and consequently it looked like we didn\u2019t take it seriously enough. We can\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d     For me this is a cabinet-level job, which needs cabinet-level experience  Andy Burnham     In an interview with the Guardian in Manchester, Burnham added: \u201cFor me this is a cabinet-level job, which needs cabinet-level experience. And it needs somebody who is going to devote themselves to it and grab it with both hands.\u201d Burnham was hoping to announce his candidacy in a speech at the Lowry in Salford on Thursday, but his team inadvertently broke their own embargo by changing the Twitter handle he used during last year\u2019s bid to be leader of the party, from @andy4leader to @andy4manchester. The profile\u2019s biographical sentence read: \u201cThe official account of Andy Burnham\u2019s campaign to be Labour\u2019s candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester.\u201d The account retained all its followers, although all the old tweets had been deleted.     Burnham\u2019s leadership Twitter profile was changed to @andy4manchester, resulting in the news of his candidacy emerging sooner than planned. Photograph: Twitter    Burnham, 46, added: \u201cThe biggest mistake would be to underplay [English devolution] and to carry on and say: \u2018Westminster\u2019s where it\u2019s at, that\u2019s where everything happens and you\u2019re not really a serious politician unless you\u2019re in Westminster.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m making a break with this thinking by announcing my candidacy for the mayor of Greater Manchester. I think I can do more for the people I care about, here, by being here rather than there, given this change. I am thinking that the time has come \u2013 Westminster has become a bit of an irrelevance for some people and we really need to change the way politics works.\u201d The election for the first mayor of Greater Manchester will take place in May 2017. Labour members in the area will vote for their candidate this summer, probably choosing between Burnham and the current interim mayor and police and crime commissioner, Tony Lloyd, or Ivan Lewis, a Blairite former minister and MP for Bury South. With nine out of 10 Greater Manchester councils run by or dominated by Labour, the Labour candidate is expected to romp to victory unless a celebrity Mancunian like Noel Gallagher comes to the fore and steals the show.     Andy Burhnham is currently the MP for Leigh, Greater Manchester Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Burnham, who came a distant second to Jeremy Corbyn in last year\u2019s leadership election, believes the mayor will have more power than his London counterpart, overseeing a radical project to integrate the region\u2019s entire \u00a36bn health and social care budget as well as overseeing transport, policing, house-building and skills. Music capital of the world He will stand on a platform promising an affordable homebuilding programme, quality apprenticeships for all school-leavers and a cycling revolution. Burnham, a passionate Stone Roses fan who boasts about seeing the Fall at Manchester\u2019s legendary Hacienda and whose last gig was the Maccabees at Manchester\u2019s Albert Hall, has also pledged to make Greater Manchester \u201cthe unrivalled music capital of Europe, if not the world\u201d. He suggested the Manchester music scene had faded since he was young. \u201cThe Manchester of my youth was the most vibrant place when it came to music. We\u2019ve maybe lost a little bit of that down the years, and I think these things really do matter.\u201d     Andy Burnham lost out to Jeremy Corbyn in last year\u2019s Labour leadership race. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    Burnham denied that he was looking for an escape from Corbyn\u2019s cabinet and insisted his candidacy wasn\u2019t a sign that he didn\u2019t believe Labour would win the 2020 election. \u201cQuite the opposite,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI think what we are going to see in politics is that Labour can gain strength from what\u2019s happening in the cities and in devolution and that\u2019s where some of the ideas that may shape the 2020 manifesto may come from: what Sadiq\u2019s doing in London, what Marvin [Rees, who was elected mayor last week] is doing in Bristol and hopefully, in time, what I\u2019m doing here. That is where Labour will renew itself and come back stronger.\u201d Burnham warned that Labour was losing support in its northern heartlands and needed to reconnect with its core vote, particularly in the light of the upcoming EU vote. \u201cLabour can\u2019t take anything for granted in the north any more. There is a concern that may have been brought on by the European referendum that Labour is losing its connection, its grip, with the traditional supporters,\u201d he said, adding that the wholly positive view of immigration espoused by the ever more \u201cLondoncentric\u201d Labour party was at odds with many of their voters in the north. Corbyn has been dismissive of what the Conservatives have called the \u201cdevolution revolution\u201d, which saw Greater Manchester lead the way in negotiating deals for extra powers in return for accepting an elected mayor. But Labour needed to not dismiss the idea because of its Tory origins, Burnham believes. \u201cThis is a big moment. Maybe Labour\u2019s problem is \u2018oh well, this is all cooked up by Osborne therefore we should keep our distance from it\u2019. What I have decided, is that would be a real mistake to do that.\u201d Evertonian Burnham\u2019s candidacy has surprised many in Greater Manchester for two key reasons: his vocal opposition to devolution, particularly health devolution, which he warned could lead to the breakup of the NHS; and the fact that the Liverpool-born MP and Everton season ticket holder is seen as more of a Scouser than a Mancunian. On the latter point, Burnham said: \u201cI can think of some other Evertonians who haven\u2019t done too bad over here \u2013 Mr Rooney and Joe Royle and Peter Reid at Man City. Does that matter? The way I look at it is: the two cities have so much in common anyway, and actually, most people have connections across the two. I\u2019m certainly in that category.\u201d  Burnham, who grew up in Culcheth near Warrington in Cheshire, said he felt neither Mancunian nor Scouse. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt between the two. Obviously I was born in Liverpool and I support Everton so there\u2019s no getting away from that. But I wouldn\u2019t be able to be accused of favouring City or United. I\u2019m impartial in that particular argument.\u201d",
