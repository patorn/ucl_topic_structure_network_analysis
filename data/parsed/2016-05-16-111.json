  "body": "It can\u2019t have been the easiest series of Sunday night phone calls. \u201cHi Ed, it\u2019s George here. George Osborne, remember me? Look, I know the prime minister once said you were the most annoying man in politics, but would it be possible for you to stop being annoying for an hour or so tomorrow morning and come and say something nice about the remain campaign? What\u2019s that? Will there be anyone else there? Absolutely not. Just you and me. You will? That\u2019s great. Thanks ever so much.\u201d George knocked back a couple of stiff drinks. One down, one to go. Nothing for it, better to get it over and done with. \u201cHi Vince.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s me, George Osborne.\u201d \u201cI know exactly who you are. What do you want?\u201d \u201cJust a chat. To catch up. How\u2019s the last year been?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get to the point?\u201d \u201cI want you to join me and say something nice and remainy.\u201d \u201cStill the same cynical George whom I know and hate.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019ll do it? Great. 10 o\u2019clock at Stansted. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d \u201cIt will be just you and me, won\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cOh absolutely, Vince. Got to go.\u201d The following morning the three men followed the Ryanair boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, past a Boeing 737 with \u201cSafer and Stronger in Europe\u201d painted down one side towards three lecterns placed to one side of the hangar. Vince Cable and Ed Balls eyed each other suspiciously, wondering what on earth the other was doing there. George acted nonchalant, trying to keep up the pretence that it was a complete coincidence they had both turned up at the same time.  George made for the centre lectern and let Ed and Vince slug it out for who was going to be standing to his right and left. He had enough of his own battles to fight. There wasn\u2019t much left to say, but he said it anyway. All the big guns of the governor of the Bank of England, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Barack Obama and the prime ministers of Japan, Australia and New Zealand had already agreed that the UK economy would be completely screwed if Britain left the EU, but no one seemed to care. Now all he had to offer was Ed and Vince. \u201cThe leave campaign seem to think everything is a great big conspiracy,\u201d said George. By the blank look on their faces, Ed and Vince didn\u2019t appear entirely sure it wasn\u2019t either. A thousand miles away, in a long-lost underground bunker in Berlin, Adolf Hitler and Martin Boorman were celebrating the rise of the Fourth Reich. George held out his hands. If Ed and Vince couldn\u2019t convince the Eurosceptics then no one could. \u201cLeaving the EU is a one-way ticket to a poorer Britain,\u201d he said. Ed jolted into life, remembering that this was his cue to speak. \u201cThank you George, thank you Michael,\u201d he stumbled. He was damned if he was going to mention Vince. The words fell out of his mouth unevenly and uncertainly. It was as if it had been so long since he had been required to talk in public that he wasn\u2019t sure if his voice still worked.

George turned around and glared at Ed, reminding him this was supposed to be a show of consensus and not group therapy. Ed pulled himself together, noted he had never wanted to take the UK into the euro, got in a passing reference to The Great British Bake-Off and Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 the high-water marks of his and Vince\u2019s recent careers \u2013 before passing over to Vince with: \u201cLeaving the EU is a one-way ticket to a poorer Britain.\u201d Vince glowered. He tried to look happy and upbeat, but he just couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cI was the business secretary in a coalition formed in the national interest and I paid a heavy price for that,\u201d he said, unwilling to let bygones be bygones. George shifted about uneasily. Vince then meandered into something about Hitler, porridge and the EU.  \u201cWhat I think Vince is trying to say,\u201d said George, finally bringing the event to a close, \u201cis leaving the EU is a one-way ticket to a poorer Britain.\u201d A pre-recorded trumpet sound played through the PA, announcing that this Ryanair flight had landed. Though \u2013 as so often \u2013 not necessarily anywhere near the destination its passengers had had in mind.",
