At dawn on 21 April 1967, after a period of political and economic uncertainty, the colonels seized power in an intimidating but bloodless coup, and remained in government for seven years. For most of that period I\u00a0was too busy learning to walk, talk and read to concern myself with what was going on in the big world beyond our front door. I have snatches of memories of the dictatorship: the national anthem being played on the black and white TV every evening before the news; the hectoring tones and frowning facial expressions of the leader, George Papadopoulos; the long and impressive military parades that often marched through the capital. It\u00a0was only later that I\u00a0came to learn what\u00a0lay beyond the quiet safety of our house in the suburbs: a world of people being taken away in the middle of the night because of their politics and their convictions; a\u00a0world of intimidation, oppression and torture. And then came the day that heralded the regime\u2019s demise \u2013 17 November 1973. Of this I have a much clearer recollection. My siblings and I were at our grandmother\u2019s apartment in the centre of Athens having lunch: probably spinach pie, lamb with macaroni and mosaiko, her chocolate biscuit cake. As we sat down to eat we heard explosions, gunfire and a loud roar that resembled a huge tidal wave but was in\u00a0fact the sound of human beings in revolt. A few blocks away, at the Athens Polytechnic, the fight against totalitarianism had begun: the birth pangs of democracy echoed across the city and into my grandmother\u2019s apartment.     Athens, December 1967. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    When the National Theatre commissioned me to write a play a few years ago I knew that, implicitly or explicitly, it needed to be about Greece. I have spent the last few years witnessing the endless drama of\u00a0its spiralling descent into economic turmoil and sociopolitical chaos. On my\u00a0many trips back to the country, I\u00a0watched friends losing their jobs, relatives struggling to keep their businesses afloat, people having to move abroad in search of employment and a\u00a0better life. And they are the lucky ones. In the early hours of the morning I have witnessed people scavenging through bins to feed their families and heard accounts of children fainting at school due to lack of food. A couple of years ago I\u00a0found myself walking into a\u00a0demonstration against what many Greeks regard as the new German occupation, Berlin\u2019s insistence on austerity as the only answer to Greece\u2019s economic woes. In the faces of those demonstrators I saw a wide range of emotions: patience, despair, rage and determination. I was by now living in the UK but all these things urged me to write about the country I\u00a0grew up\u00a0in \u2013 the country that infuriates me but that I also love with a passion. I went back to Greece to write the play \u2013 I felt it important to be in the place that inspired it and to absorb the\u00a0arguments and feelings swirling around. I\u00a0came to realise that many of\u00a0the problems being faced today have their roots in a\u00a0troubled history that shaped both Greece\u2019s resilience and its\u00a0susceptibility to a string of foreign influences. It became clear that in writing a play about Greece\u2019s fate and aspirations, I\u00a0had to include characters from the countries that had so markedly shaped its destiny over the past 100 years: Britain and the United States. And the more I explored these international relationships, the more I came to see that they ran concurrently with the history of my own family.   Related: The Pride \u2013 review    After the Nazi occupation and the subsequent famine in which my grandfather died of consumption, Greece was liberated with the help of the British. Before America\u2019s Marshall plan injected cash into the country\u2019s coffers and secured its allegiance, a bloody civil war had made visible the deep divisions between left and right\u00a0and their respective ideologies. It\u00a0was during that time that my father was arrested one night on the streets of Athens by members of\u00a0EDES, the National Republican Greek League. He\u00a0was taken to their headquarters and subjected to falanga, a\u00a0form of torture in which the soles of\u00a0the feet are repeatedly whipped with a cane. No explanation was given \u2013 my father suspected that they mistook him to be a\u00a0member of ELAS, the opposing Communist Liberation Army \u2013 and he was quickly ejected out on to\u00a0the street again. But this short and traumatic incident, about which he rarely spoke, highlighted for me the very dark past under the shadow of which we all lived. As a young man my father was drawn to the west, to its ideals, its intellectual and artistic sensibilities, its sophistication. His first wife was American, his second, my mother, was British. He studied in Switzerland and returned to\u00a0Greece to become the headteacher of a prestigious school. He was equally happy speaking Greek, English or French, and his outlook and philosophy were shaped by a myriad of foreign cultural influences. But in his heart he\u00a0remained stereotypically and stubbornly Greek: passionate, mistrustful of authority, petulant and insecure, but loving. He was also politically undecided \u2013 resentful of class hierarchies and social inequality, though suspicious of what he regarded as the naiveties and denials of socialism. And, like his native country, he constantly struggled to find his own unique identity while indelibly influenced by outside forces.     Sunset at the Villa Thalia at the National Theatre. Photograph: Manuel Harlan    What was happening in Greece at that point was just one example of tensions being played out in many other countries across the\u00a0world \u2013 from Nicaragua to\u00a0Vietnam, Zaire to\u00a0Spain \u2013 part\u00a0of the\u00a0titanic struggle between US\u2011led capitalism and Soviet communism. We\u00a0eventually watched communism implode as a result of its\u00a0refusal to acknowledge some of the most\u00a0basic precepts of\u00a0human nature \u2013 personal ambition, self-determination, freedom of individual thought and its expression. And yet in Greece I feel we are now watching the slow demise of its opposite for the\u00a0same reasons. Neoliberalism\u2019s stubborn negation of\u00a0community, aspects of tradition, the\u00a0human need for balance and social equality, and the\u00a0irrefutable truth that not everything can be bought and sold in the global marketplace will finally sound its death knell. And it is ironic that this\u00a0death seems to be occurring most overtly in the birthplace of democracy. Because one of the big lies that many of us seem to have bought into is that\u00a0capitalism and democracy are\u00a0synonymous. I remember Greece in the 80s and 90s \u2013 deluded, corrupt, profligate, hungry for all the material goods that had evaded it for so long and\u00a0addicted to the highs they provided. Drunk on the illusion of\u00a0its new success, and steadily building up the Olympian mountain of\u00a0debts that would later cause its\u00a0catastrophic downfall, it seemed to\u00a0have lost any self-knowledge and wisdom it\u00a0may have acquired through years of\u00a0occupation, poverty and adversity. And\u00a0it was during these years, when the streets of\u00a0Athens were paved with gold, that I\u00a0remember thinking that something was being lost. I didn\u2019t know\u00a0quite what that something was, how to define it or\u00a0describe it. But if there is one good thing to come from the suffering and struggles that the people of Greece are now enduring, perhaps it is to do with regaining that ineffable thing that had disappeared. I\u00a0suspect it exists somewhere between the two extreme poles that the 20th century offered as the only viable alternatives. It is an equilibrium, a\u00a0profound and determined effort to\u00a0ask the right questions; to find\u00a0the connection to our better selves and the\u00a0people we share the planet with. The roots of a\u00a0healthy democracy in the place where it all started. The kind of Greece that my father may have found some happiness and stability in. \u2022 Sunset at the Villa Thalia is at the Dorfman theatre, London SE1, until 4\u00a0August.",
