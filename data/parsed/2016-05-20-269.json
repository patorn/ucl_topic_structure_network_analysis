They carry into battle Richard III, Sherlock Holmes, Elizabeth Bennet, the Red Queen, the Olympics, Love Actually, a dozen Hamlets and even the dear old Queen. They are actors, novelists, writers, directors, celebrities, names, all names, big names (who got left off?). The EU may be facing the darkest crisis in its existence, but never has it received such a dazzling testimonial. It is indelicate to ask how an Equity card conveys authority on target two balances, optimum currency areas and the sheep-meat premium. But as Brexiters cite Napoleon, Hitler and \u201c250 businessmen\u201d, so remain\u2019s signature harvest can rally celebrities to its flag under the golden rubric, \u201cvital EU funding\u201d.   Related: British cultural stars sign 250-strong letter backing EU    Virtue by association is standard practice in lobbying. The UN and NGOs garner celebrities on the reasonable assumption that a headline with pictures does no harm and may do good. But in a debate now as hysterical as Brexit, it\u2019s hard to see how 250 actors rate higher than 250 teachers, social workers, train drivers or waiters. I am sure the same might be said of commentators, except that some of us do at least try to read up on the subject. A few lucky people have done well out of European subsidies. There is no reason for such subsidies to be decried. But that lucky people benefit from Brussels\u2019 largesse is hardly a clincher for everyone else. It is also absurd to imply that British actors excluded from the EU would be \u201coutsiders shouting from the wings\u201d. Most do far more work in America anyway, which is outside the EU\u2019s open borders. They are hardly outsiders in Hollywood. These are bad, silly arguments. There is no open EU market in services and that is a fact. It is one of the EU\u2019s many failures. The luvvies\u2019 letter, like those on both sides from sportsmen, scientists and cheap-jack employers, merely shows what we know: that most people vote with their wallets. Political argument is easier when couched, not in facts or predictions, but in fears and favours. We search the news for signs of comfort, not for reasons. When Montagues and Capulets meet at the street corner they do not swap statistics. They puff up their finery. They boast their allies and show their muscle. Remain\u2019s purpose today is to show the Brexit tribe as a bunch of outsiders, small guys, nobodies, people who cannot dream of \u201cvital EU funding\u201d. This can cut two ways. Perhaps Brexit should hit back with a letter from 250 people of whom nobody has ever heard.",
