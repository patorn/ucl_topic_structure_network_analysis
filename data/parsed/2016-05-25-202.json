  "body": "Netflix and Amazon\u2019s European operations will have to guarantee to that at least 20% of video content in their catalogue is from Europe, according to a shake-up of broadcasting rules unveiled by the European Commission on Wednesday. European regulators are introducing the new rules to make the new wave of digital on-demand and streaming services adhere to the same, or similar, commitments that traditional TV broadcasters are forced to follow in Europe.

The Commission\u2019s proposal also said member states have the option to make on-demand services \u201ccontribute financially\u201d to making new European films and TV series. This can be through direct investment in European TV and film productions, such as Amazon\u2019s investment in ex-Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s new TV series, or as a levy payable into a fund. Netflix recently premiered its first French language series, the political drama Marseilles starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu, and British period drama The Crown, which will launch later this year. \u201cOverall, strengthening the promotion of European works for on-demand services will lead to a broader and more diverse offer for Europeans,\u201d the Commission said. \u201cThis will have a positive impact on cultural diversity and bring more opportunities for European creators.\u201d Netflix disagreed with the Commission\u2019s ruling, arguing that a quota system, as well as forced investment in European productions, will not necessarily lead to quality shows being made.   Related: Mike Leigh's Peterloo massacre drama heading to Amazon    Instead, it could lead to operators buying, or investing in, cheap productions and \u201cfiller\u201d content to hit quotas. \u201cOur members around the world love European programming, that\u2019s why our investment in European programming, including Netflix original titles created in Europe, is growing,\u201d said a spokesman for Netflix. \u201cWe appreciate the Commission\u2019s objective to have European production flourish, however the proposed measures won\u2019t actually achieve that.\u201d  Netflix said it has committed \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of euros to European productions so far, as well as having partnerships with broadcasters including the BBC, for Watership Down, and ITV for Marcella, which stars Anna Friel. According to a study provided by the European Commission, Netflix and Apple\u2019s iTunes already devote 21% of their film catalogue to content from the European Union. The European Commission\u2019s new rules also state that services such as YouTube will have to beef up protections for younger users being exposed to harmful content such as videos with pornographic or violent content, and \u201cprotect all citizens from incitement to hatred\u201d. \u201cDetailed measures include tools for users to report and flag harmful content, age verification, or parental control systems,\u201d said the Commission. The European Commission said it is weeks away from presenting the results of a code of conduct on combatting hate speech online that it has been working on with major online platforms. \u201cThe way we watch TV or videos may have changed, but our values don\u2019t,\u201d said G\u00fcnther Oettinger, commissioner for the digital economy and society. \u201cWith these new rules we will uphold media pluralism, the independence of audiovisual regulators and will make sure incitement to hatred will have no room on video-sharing platforms. We also want to ensure a level-playing field, responsible behaviour, trust and fairness in the online platforms environment.\u201d",
