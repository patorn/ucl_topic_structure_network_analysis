  "body": "As a kid I loved the Picture Book of the Saints. It was full of feminist icons \u2013 Teresa of Avila, Joan of Arc (my confirmation name) and Elizabeth of Hungary. But one of my favourites was Catherine of Siena. She is a doctor of the church, a notable ecclesiologist and a persuader of popes. To quote the Picture Book:   Catherine made a special visit to Pope Gregory XI (then living in France) and said \u201cHoly Father, God wants the head of the Church to live in Rome. I pray you go there as soon as possible.\u201d And once again Rome became the home of the Popes.     Related: Protesters urge pope to ordain female priests and stop 'legitimizing sexism'    As if a woman could change a pope\u2019s mind that easily. Or can she? Last week Pope Francis held a \u201ctown-hall\u201d style meeting with the heads of 900 women\u2019s religious orders. Questions were wide-ranging, with the pope joking he felt like a \u201cgoalie \u2026 standing there waiting for the ball and not knowing where it\u2019s going to come from\u201d.  But the Catherine of Siena moment came when one of the women pointed Francis to Phoebe, often referred to as a deaconess in the early church, and asked him to set up an official commission to study the question of women deacons in church history.  \u201cI accept,\u201d the pope said. \u201c(The role of the deaconess) was a bit obscure \u2026 It would do good for the church to clarify this point. I am in agreement.\u201d Initial, breathless media reports that suggested the pope was on the verge of allowing women to be ordained as deacons: \u201cFrancis\u2019 openness to studying the possibility of women serving as deacons could represent an historic shift for the global Catholic church, which does not ordain women as clergy.\u201d  As much as I would like to believe it, that\u2019s not going to happen. Francis is the master of being all things to all people, using \u201coff the cuff\u201d remarks to sound progressive but changing nothing when it comes to actual church rules. Remember Francis\u2019 comment in 2013 about homosexual people: \u201cwho am I to judge?\u201d Francis\u2019 teaching on the family released last month did not remove the church\u2019s judgement that homosexual people are disordered. In this case, the pope isn\u2019t just playing to the crowd; he\u2019s setting them up for disappointment. The pope says the role of ordained women deaconesses is unclear and he will ask the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to study it.  Great! I\u2019m guessing they\u2019ll start with their 2002 report, From the Diakonia of Christ to the Diakonia of the Apostles. Its conclusion? Deaconesses in the early church \u201cwere not purely and simply equivalent to the deacons.\u201d  Then the CDF will likely move on to the book Priesthood and Diaconate, written by its head, Cardinal Gerhardt Mueller. It also determines that there is no equivalence between deaconesses and male deacons in the early church. The point? There is zero chance that this study, by this congregation headed by this cardinal, is going to find some theological basis that women can be ordained permanent deacons today. More likely we are going to hear the usual \u201cfeminine genius\u201d and \u201ccomplementarity of the sexes\u201d claptrap. You know: women deacons played a particular role. They were a minor deaconate. They were not equivalent to men. They were only ordained in the early church to minister to women (eg, baptise them by full immersion when it would have been improper for men to see a woman naked). There is no need for such a ministry now. Their ordination did not equal \u201choly orders.\u201d Blah, blah, blah. I hope I\u2019m wrong. Forty years of being a Catholic feminist tells me I\u2019m not going to be. I\u2019m not alone. The Women\u2019s Ordination Conference, while welcoming the study, notes that in the same meeting with the women, Pope Francis repeated the church\u2019s argument that women cannot act \u201cin the person of Christ\u201d and therefore cannot preach or preside over the Eucharist. The conference commented:  WOC rejects this flawed interpretation that a male body is a necessary condition representing the Body of Christ. Upholding this discrimination, as though it were the will of God, is simply indefensible.     Related: Female deacons could lead to female priests \u2013 and the Vatican knows it | Andrew Brown    So study away, Pope Francis. Keep celebrating women as the \u201cstrawberries on the cake\u201d and telling us we are \u201cthe most beautiful thing God has made\u201d. But until women are included on our own merits, ordained as priests and bishops in the church, you head up a sexist institution where equality is denied, where talents are unused, theology is flawed and ministry is left undone. By the way, Catherine of Siena acquired a form of mental illness and starved herself to death at 33. (The Picture Book of Saints left that part out.) I\u2019ve often thought that Catherine was most likely driven mad because she was an intelligent woman frustrated by the limitations she faced living in the 14th century.  No amount of special visits and letter-writing was going to change the patriarchal church then. And I doubt very much a study by the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith into deaconesses is going to change anything now.",
