  "body": "After releasing his 2014 novel Analogue Men, Australian novelist Nick Earls began kicking around a few new story ideas. He assembled the best five and instinctively felt they would each hit the 20,000 word mark \u2013 the \u201cnovella\u201d grey zone between a short story and a novel.  \u201cMy first thought was no publisher is going to welcome me knocking on the door with that,\u201d Earls explains. Earls is releasing these novellas on the first of every month under the umbrella title Wisdom Tree, starting with Gotham released on Monday. Audiobook versions are being simultaneously released on Audible, narrated by Australian actors Rhys Muldoon, Flynn Curry, Gyton Grantley, Michael Dorman and William McInnes.   Related: The big short \u2013 why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future    The publishing industry has never been a fan of the novella, and the reason is purely economical: with fixed-price overheads like printing, binding, warehousing, distribution and marketing, it costs almost as much to make a small book as it does a medium-sized one. But readers expect a slimmer copy to be cheaper in price. Yet Earls was determined to write these novellas \u2013 even if that meant changing industry attitudes in the process. He hopes readers will stop seeing the novella as an \u201cin-betweener\u201d rather the ideal reading experience for today\u2019s time-poor readers. He was encouraged by the book industry\u2019s ongoing migration into the digital space and its comparatively cheaper overheads. \u201cIn the 21st century, the game has surely changed,\u201d he says. \u201cAn ebook can be whatever size it needs to be, and you price it as you choose to price it.\u201d In fact, the first-ever mass-market ebook was a novella: 2000\u2019s Riding the Bullet by Stephen King. It was a happy milestone after King\u2019s long struggle to see his novellas published; in his 1982 collection of four novellas, Different Seasons, one of which was adapted into the Academy award-nominated film The Shawshank Redemption, he called the form \u201can anarchy-ridden literary banana republic\u201d. The digital revolution smoothed the way for King to write and publish more novellas, and he has been joined by a host of big-name authors, including Patricia Cornwell and John Grisham, who have released Kindle Singles. The format was launched by Amazon\u2019s Kindle in 2011 and is described as \u201ccompelling ideas expressed at their natural length\u201d \u2013 typically essays, short stories and novellas between 5,000 and 30,000 words. Sometimes they are used by novelists to release nimble spin-offs from their existing fictional worlds.     Gotham by Nick Earls. Photograph: One Green Bean    For Earls, writing Wisdom Tree was a way to swiftly explore how men grapple with early 21st century life through five standalone stories, each featuring an Australian male protagonist of different ages. \u201cEach looks at what we value, and at the things that are pitched to us by society to value like fame, celebrity. But at the same time this story has another current flowing deeper, looking at the things that actually matter in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says.  So we have Gotham, an encounter between a music journalist and the young rapper he is interviewing called Na$ti Boi; Venice, about love and the tensions that pull us apart; Vancouver, featuring one man and \u201cthe giant that influenced his life\u201d; Juneau, set in a former Alaskan gold-rush town; and NoHo, featuring Charlie and his would-be-star sister, Cassie, in Hollywood. Earls says audio books have also been affected by the digital revolution. \u201cInstead of being a $70 box of cassette tapes that were pretty cumbersome, they\u2019re now something you can play on a device that just about every one of us carries around in our pocket or our bag.\u201d        He has been closely watching the rise of podcasting, too. Blockbuster podcast Serial, for instance, is the radio equivalent of \u201cnatural-length\u201d publishing, with episodes that vary between 30 minutes to over an hour long. \u201cThere really doesn\u2019t need to be any size rules.\u201d   Related: Audiobooks are booming \u2013 and now there\u2019s a chart to prove it    When I suggest that we may soon see the end of even defining whether a work is a short story, novella or novel, Earls says for writers the distinction can still be meaningful. When writing a short story \u201cyou\u2019ve got that one piece of business, and you\u2019re not supposed to mess around in doing it\u201d; both novels and novellas are more complex affair with multiple plot lines. It is important for writers to start with a vision of the size and scope of a piece, Earls says. He is excited about the staggered release of his five novellas, which he says \u201cdoes justice to what they are\u201d rather than if they were bound as a single volume. \u201cIt actually gives people small books that says if you\u2019ve got two to three hours to read, here\u2019s something that\u2019s for you. And there\u2019s no compromise on quality, it\u2019s just shorter than a novel.\u201d  Gotham is the first novella from Wisdom Tree by Nick Earls and is available as an audio book for free for a limited time on Audible, and as a digital book or in paperback",
