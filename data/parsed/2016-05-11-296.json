Surely as a good Guardian-reading type you\u2019re more into a Scandi-cardigan crime drama \u2026 But if you are ready to admit to it, you\u2019re not alone. Coronation Street and EastEnders regularly reel in 6 million viewers, which is pretty impressive in a world where linear TV is supposed to be fading as fast as Peggy Mitchell. Creating soaps is a relentless business, from storylining to the acting that makes it look so easy. Throwaway, even. If traditional 9pm dramas such as Line Of Duty and The Night Manager are booming, why should the weeknight, early evening offering be thought of as a lesser art form?   Related: EastEnders boss: 'There's a real snobbery towards soaps'    \u201cThere\u2019s a real snobbery towards soaps, which is sad,\u201d EastEnders\u2019 outgoing executive producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, told the Radio Times this week. \u201cEveryone knows that soaps prop up the schedules and that new dramas are shown off the back of them, on both the BBC and ITV. But there\u2019s still this attitude of, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just EastEnders\u2019.\u201d It would be a shame if the new EastEnders set became a victim of BBC budget cuts because the soap \u2013 and the genre \u2013 deserves more. Treadwell-Collins leaves it fighting fit and evolving like its audience, whether that means airing more issue-based storylines, bringing Grant Mitchell back or serving cocktails in jam jars. For every actor who sees a part in a soap as a means to an end, there\u2019s another who truly loves the non-stop pace, the difference you can make with just one episode and the opportunity to burst into living rooms and give the viewers a prod. Some of the finest TV actors cut their teeth in soaps. Suranne Jones, who won a Bafta for her part in Doctor Foster, can convey so much emotion with just one look, a skill she displayed back when she was Coronation Street\u2019s hoop-earringed virago Karen McDonald. Happy Valley\u2019s Sarah Lancashire, Raquel in Corrie, has described soaps as \u201ca double-edged sword\u201d, adding: \u201cYou have to rise above such ludicrous prejudice.\u201d     Suranne Jones, right, as Karen McDonald, marrying Steve (Simon Gregson). Photograph: Granada TV    It\u2019s not just the homegrown offerings that are star factories: Neighbours and Home And Away, which were exported to the UK in the 80s selling Australian sunshine and all the escapism that goes with it, have spawned more than just Kylie and Dannii Minogue. Russell Crowe, Margot Robbie, Chris and Liam Hemsworth: all got their first taste of success in the Aussie soaps. Soap operas have long been a much-loved element of the British TV schedule, since the days when legends such as Hilda Ogden, Ena Sharples and Elsie Tanner ruled the screen. EastEnders shook up the scene with its gritty storylines in 1985, joining Phil Redmond\u2019s Brookside as part of a new breed of harder-hitting drama. It was Redmond who brought a new realism to the genre. Brookside tackled the big issues of the day, along with a good dose of sensationalism. Beth Jordache (Anna Friel) and Margaret Clemence (Nicola Stephenson) shared the first soap lesbian kiss and Sue Johnston\u2019s powerful portrayal of Sheila Grant\u2019s recovery from rape showed her experience as a complete story, not just an isolated incident that was brushed under the carpet. EastEnders, the enfant terrible of soaps, brought Colin and Barry\u2019s relationship, Nick Cotton\u2019s drug addiction and Mark Fowler\u2019s diagnosis as HIV positive. Today, under Treadwell-Collins, the soap has worked closely with mental health charity Mind on Stacey\u2019s post-partum psychosis storyline.

Moments of subtlety count just as much as Twitter explosions. Behind Danny Dyer\u2019s cockney rhyming slang and propensity to close his eyes if he ever needs to administer a threat lies the real Mick Carter, the supportive husband and loving dad who squeezed his son Johnny tightly as he came out.     \u2018EastEnders, the enfant terrible of soaps, brought Nick Cotton\u2019s (John Altman) drug addiction. Photograph: BBC/Adam Pensotti/BBC    Soaps are a place where equality rules. Old and young each get their moment, and the women take centre stage. When Emmerdale revealed that one of its characters would be HIV positive, it was Val, a woman in her 50s who had contracted it during a holiday fling in Portugal. Not only did it buck stereotypes, but Val also raised awareness of safe sex for her age group. As Peggy Mitchell proves, every age gets its moment in the soap spotlight and older characters aren\u2019t just written off \u2013 their aren\u2019t many corners of the TV schedule where that is true. Soap women are matriarchs and warriors: throw infidelity, baby loss, cancer and anything else you dare at them, but eventually they\u2019ll put on their lippie and get back out there, in the great tradition of Bet Lynch. Like it or not, soaps are the cockroaches of the TV schedule and they\u2019ll be screaming: \u201cGet outta my pub\u201d for many years to come.",
