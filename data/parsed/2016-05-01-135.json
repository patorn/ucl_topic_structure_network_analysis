Obama did not linger on Trump for as long as some had expected during his half-hour speech, especially those who recall the correspondents\u2019 dinner in 2011 where he roasted the celebrity tycoon as he sat in the room.  Watched by an audience that included politicians, journalists, actors and Trump\u2019s two sons, he pretended to wind up his remarks before interrupting himself: \u201cNo, I\u2019m just kidding, you know I\u2019ve got to talk about Trump. We weren\u2019t just going to stop there. Come on! \u201cAlthough I am a little hurt that he\u2019s not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. And it is surprising: you\u2019ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What\u2019s he doing?\u201d Evidently relishing this election year, Obama then made reference to Trump\u2019s former ownership of the Miss Universe beauty pageant. \u201cThe Republican establishment is incredulous that he is the most likely nominee,\u201d he continued. \u201cIncredulous! Shocking! They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president but, in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world. Miss Sweden. Miss Argentina. Miss Azerbaijan.\u201d As guests erupted in laughter, the candidate\u2019s claim to be a winner in business was also targeted. \u201cAnd there\u2019s one area where Donald\u2019s experience could be invaluable and that\u2019s closing Guantanamo because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.\u201d Obama said he had more material but would leave it there, prompting the crowd to beg for more. He went on to make a sardonic-but-serious point about the avalanche of media coverage devoted to Trump, who has warned that any attempt to deny him the Republican nomination at the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in July could lead to violent protests. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend too much time on The Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cFollowing your lead, I want to show some restraint because I think we can all agree that, from the start, he\u2019s gotten the appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. I hope y\u2019all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost and now we\u2019re praying that Cleveland makes it through July.\u201d At that, Obama shook his head slightly and grunted: \u201cMmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm.\u201d           White House correspondents\u2019 dinner: Obama\u2019s best zingers    Trump\u2019s rival Ted Cruz received barbs for his recent reference to a \u201cbasketball ring\u201d while campaigning in Indiana. Obama, whose father was Kenyan, said: \u201cWhat else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But, sure, I\u2019m the foreign one.\u201d But Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats were not spared. When Obama hailed Sanders as \u201cthe bright new face of the Democratic party\u201d, the white-haired, 74-year-old leftwinger, wearing a lounge suit instead of a tuxedo, rose to acknowledge audience applause. The president said: \u201cI am hurt, though, Bernie, that you\u2019ve been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that\u2019s just not something that you do to your comrade.\u201d He then compared Sanders\u2019 slogan, \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d, to an imagined one for Clinton that flashed up on screens: \u201cTrudge up the Hill\u201d, with the image of an \u201cH\u201d pushing a rock up a slope. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit it though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. \u2018Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.\u2019 It\u2019s not entirely persuasive.\u201d Clinton was also on the receiving end when Obama began his remarks by apologising for being late. He explained: \u201cI was running on CPT, which stands for \u2018jokes that white people should not make\u2019\u201d \u2013 a reference to a recent sketch by New York mayor Bill de Blasio and Clinton in which she castigated him for endorsing her so late, and he claimed to have been \u201crunning on CP time\u201d (\u201ccoloured-people time\u201d).

Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters    Obama went on: \u201cHere we are, my eighth and final appearance at this unique event and I am excited. If this material works well I\u2019m going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. Earn me some serious Tubmans,\u201d \u2013 references to Clinton\u2019s lucrative speeches on Wall Street and the recent decision to put the founder of the Underground Railroad on the national currency. As in past years, Obama made himself the butt of some of jokes, reflecting on the imminent end of his presidency. \u201cI\u2019m grey, grizzled, just counting down the days to my death panel.\u201d He added: \u201cEven some foreign leaders have been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.\u201d But he also noted: \u201cIn my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major.\u201d He said he and his aides were mystified as to the cause of his popularity, while the video feed cut to a pictures of Cruz and Trump. There was also a spoof video, \u201cCouch Commander\u201d, in which Obama and old foe John Boehner, former speaker of the House, united to consider life after leaving office. Obama made a glancing reference to TV series Game of Thrones, described British actor Helen Mirren as \u201cawesome\u201d and, in paying tribute to vice-president Joe Biden, took a backwards swipe at George W Bush\u2019s deputy Dick Cheney. \u201cI love Joe Biden, I really do. I want to thank him for his friendship, his counsel, for always giving it to me straight. For not shooting anybody in the face.\u201d The president\u2019s speech clearly tickled the audience in the Washington Hilton ballroom that included Biden, John Kerry, Republican party chairman Reince Priebus, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and actors Mirren, Jared Leto, Bryan Cranston, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Hiddleston.       Turning serious at the end, the president thanked the White House correspondents and praised a free press. \u201cI just have two more words to say: Obama out.\u201d With that, he held out the mic and dropped it, just as basketball star Kobe Bryant had recently done at the end of his last game.   Related: President Obama's final White House Correspondents' dinner \u2013 as it happened    Obama proved a hard act to follow. Comedian Larry Wilmore\u2019s routine had a more mixed reception, with gags about the media prompting groans but other lines hitting the mark. He ended on a poignant and unexpected note. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I lived in a country where people couldn\u2019t accept a black quarterback,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cNow think about that. A black man was thought by his mere colour not good enough to lead a football team. And now to live in your time, Mr President, when a black man can lead the entire free world. Words alone do me no justice. So, Mr President, if I\u2019m going to keep it 100.\u201d Wilmore pounded his chest and said: \u201cYo, Barry, you did it, my nigga!\u201d The Washington Hilton ballroom was crowded with celebrities. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joined vice president Joe Biden, secretary of state John Kerry and other government officials.",
