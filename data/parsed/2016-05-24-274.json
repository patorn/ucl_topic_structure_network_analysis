  "body": "Paul McCartney has revealed that he started drinking heavily and came close to quitting music altogether after the Beatles disbanded in 1970. Discussing his career at a recording of Mastertapes for Radio 4, the songwriter described how he formed the group Wings. \u201cI was depressed. You would be. You were breaking from your lifelong friends,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I took to the bevvies. I took to a wee dram. It was great at first, then suddenly I wasn\u2019t having a good time \u2026 I wanted to get back to square one, so I ended up forming Wings.\u201d \u201cIt was difficult to know what to do after the Beatles. How do you follow that?\u201d he asked presenter John Wilson.   Related: Scat, scrapping songs and screaming: a guide to being the next Beatles    McCartney also touched on the criticism aimed at Wings, agreeing that he and his wife Linda, who died in 1998, \u201cweren\u2019t that good\u201d. He said: \u201cWe were terrible. We knew Linda couldn\u2019t play, but she learned, and looking back on it, I\u2019m really glad we did it \u2026 I could have just formed a supergroup, and rung up Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page and John Bonham,\u201d McCartney said, before adding: \u201cBut you still remember the names of the people who gave you really bad, vicious reviews: Charles Shaar Murray shall ever be hated!\u201d The audience in the BBC\u2019s Maida Vale studio, which included Brad Pitt, James Bay and Paul Weller, were also privy to discussions about his relationship with John Lennon. \u201cI was really grateful that we got it back together before he died. Because it would have been very difficult to deal with if \u2026 well, it was very difficult anyway.\u201d           Never before seen footage of the Beatles backstage in 1965    McCartney played a few bars of Here Today, the song he wrote about Lennon in 1982, and said: \u201cI\u2019m quite private and don\u2019t like to give too much away. Why should people know my innermost thoughts? But a song is the place to put them. In Here Today, I say to John, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t have said that to him unless we were extremely drunk \u2013 I love you, man! \u2013 but you can put these emotions, these deeper and sometimes awkward truths, in a song.\u201d  McCartney also spoke about collaborating with Kanye West on Rihanna\u2019s song FourFiveSeconds. \u201cI love Kanye and he loves me. He\u2019s a monster. He\u2019s a crazy guy who comes up with great stuff, so he inspires me. It was definitely different, because we never appeared to write a song. A lot of what we did was just tell each other stories.\u201d  The episode of Mastertapes will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 10am on 28 May, and a filmed version will be available on BBC iPlayer.",
