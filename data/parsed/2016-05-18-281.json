The fan site Making Star Wars claims Vader will be played by Welsh actor Spencer Wilding, with James Earl Jones returning to provide the character\u2019s voice. In a key character guide panorama, the Sith lord\u2019s head is grandly superimposed above images of Rebel and Imperial troops, suggesting he will play a key role in the story.
