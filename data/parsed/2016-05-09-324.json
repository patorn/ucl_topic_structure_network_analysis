  "body": "There are only two types of people who travel in and out of London by train every day: the ones who dislike it, and those who hate it with a passion. The passengers flocking to Fenchurch Street station every evening fall largely into the latter category, having come to loathe their long journey home to Essex. A new timetable introduced before Christmas means fewer carriages and more stops in the capital, making the c2c rush-hour trains some of the most crowded in the country. The south Essex line became notorious back in January when one commuter reportedly wet himself because there was no way of getting to the toilet through a crushed aisle. \u201cIn the end he just couldn\u2019t hold it,\u201d said a despairing fellow passenger. James Savill is one of the angry travellers who finds he often has to stand all the way home \u2013 almost 50 minutes to the town of Stanford-le-Hope. The 37-year-old insurance executive now uses @c2c_customers to tweet photos of jam-packed carriages, and helped stage a protest at Fenchurch Street earlier this year. \u201cSome nights people are swearing at each other as they\u2019re jostling to get on,\u201d says Savill. \u201cThey\u2019re shouting at each other: \u2018Move down the train!\u2019 but there\u2019s literally no more space. I\u2019ve seen an old woman crying because she just couldn\u2019t get on at West Ham. There have been instances of staff actually pushing people on like it\u2019s India or Japan, or somewhere like that.\u201d     Commuter James Savill has become a vocal campaigner about conditions on the c2c line. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    Some of Essex\u2019s c2c commuters have drawn the Conservative MP for Thurrock, Jackie Doyle-Price, into arguments on Twitter, feeling she has failed to champion their cause. Feeling harassed, Doyle-Price has accused the group of \u201ctedious\u201d trolling. Yet the anger does appear to have had an impact with the operator: c2c is to start running additional carriages later this year, three years earlier than planned. \u201cWe\u2019re a vocal bunch in Essex,\u201d says Savill. \u201cYou have to make sure your voice is heard.\u201d The south-east remains the seething epicentre of commuter fury. This year\u2019s Which? survey found the region to have the least satisfied passengers in the country. It backs up a recent study by watchdog Transport Focus showing Thameslink, Southeastern and Southern to be the nation\u2019s least-popular operators. Barely a week goes by without a new commuter petition popping up online. The most common kind pleads for a government review into the franchise of a hated operator. Other demands range from making refunds easier to making a seat for every customer a legal requirement. Where once upon a time, home counties commuters could expect a comfortable, seated journey into London before being swallowed up on the Underground, figures released by the Department for Transport last year showed that 139,000 workers coming into London \u2013 one in five \u2013 are now forced to stand all the way. The City commuter recently photographed squatting in the cleaning cupboard next to a bucket and mop (a spot he has occupied every day from Ipswich to Liverpool Street) seemed to capture the new, more crowded normal.       Overcrowding is not the only thing driving people to distraction, however. Major annoyances include the regularity of delays (across Britain, an average of 57 trains run significantly late each day) and, of course, the price of tickets: the costliest in Europe, according to the TUC and Action for Rail. There seems little prospect of passions cooling. The population of London is expected to reach 10 million by 2030, with a substantial growth in numbers \u2013 from 15 million to 17 million \u2013 expected across the wider south-east region over the same period. Feeder towns and satellite cities such as Slough, Reading, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead continue to swell in unison with the people-pulling, job-creating capital city. Will the rail network prove capable of getting all these extra worker bees into London \u2013 or is the severely under-pressure commuter system about to reach breaking point? Some are already reconsidering a routine that requires working in London and living outside the M25. Jennifer Woodside relies on a Southern train from Polegate, deep in East Sussex, to get her to a charity communications job in London: \u201cIt\u2019s just such an atrocious service that commuting has become a real strain,\u201d says the 49-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe I\u2019m paying \u00a34,000 a year for a service that constantly gets me in late. It\u2019s somewhere between five and 15 minutes late into Clapham Junction pretty much every day, and at least once a month it\u2019ll be more 30 minutes late. Sometimes the announcer tells you about signalling failure, sometimes it\u2019s because someone\u2019s been taken ill \u2013 you\u2019ll hear two or three different reasons on the same train.\u201d Train drivers and station announcers must be Britain\u2019s most experienced \u2013 and jaded \u2013 apologisers, spending much of their day saying \u201csorry\u201d over the public address system. Sick of the daily apology as she steps off at Clapham Junction, sick of spending three hours on a train each day, Woodside says she and her husband \u2013 who also commutes into London \u2013 are now considering a change of lifestyle. \u201cWe would both love to find work close to home,\u201d she says. \u201cWe love where we live, but we just find the commute so draining now. If everyone wants to either live in London or work in London, I don\u2019t know how the system is going to cope.\u201d Some major infrastructure projects promise to stop the city grinding to a halt. Crossrail \u2013 the newly named Elizabeth line \u2013 will provide more capacity for commuters in parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex from 2018. Crossrail 2, although at least another 15 years away, will offer yet more options and ease pressure on congested routes running into Waterloo and Liverpool Street stations. A massive franchising change is also expected. The Department for Transport has proposed giving Transport for London (TfL) control of the \u201csuburban\u201d services running into London; all commuter services coming in and out of London Bridge, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Moorgate, Victoria and Waterloo stations would be incorporated into TfL\u2019s network as contracts expire between 2017 and 2021. \u201cOnly the whole, I\u2019m hopeful TfL might take a grip of the thing,\u201d says Stephen Joseph at the Campaign for Better Transport. \u201cI don\u2019t think some improvement is too much to ask for.\u201d     James Savill: \u2018I\u2019ve seen an old woman crying because she couldn\u2019t get on at West Ham.\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    But will \u201csome improvement\u201d be enough to keep up with such huge and growing demand? Lord True, the head of Richmond council, recently revealed town hall bosses had been briefed about a population forecast of 13 million for London by 2050. He suggests it is time to ask the public if it wants \u201cbroad limits\u201d enforced on the size of the capital. Daniel Moylan, a TfL board member and the Mayor of London\u2019s advisor on Crossrail 2, is also concerned about how a city of 10 million in the not-so-distant future will function. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a city of 10 million in Europe, so it remains a huge experiment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the birth rate alone means it really is going to happen, regardless of immigration.\u201d Moylan thinks there is a lack of strategic clarity from the government about whether it really wants to encourage people to move outside of London. For a while, George Osborne was keen on building brand new \u201cgarden\u201d cities in Ebsfleet and other sites in the south to absorb some of the demand. Yet fewer than 100 houses have been built at Ebsfleet, despite great fanfare two years ago about \u00a3200m of public infrastructure investment to support 15,000 new homes. In his most recent budget, the chancellor changed tack and stressed the importance of building up existing suburbs in London\u2019s outer boroughs and other cities across the UK.

Photograph: Mark Burton-Sampson/C2C Customers    \u201cMy own view is that London should be able to accommodate its own growth,\u201d says Moylan. \u201cOne of the things we need to decide, urgently, is whether the plan is to accommodate population growth within London, to have a programme for shifting people out into new satellite towns, or to intensify development in existing satellite towns. \u201cAt the moment we jump from one policy to another. We need a proper plan, because there\u2019s all the infrastructure like sewage and electricity to consider as well as transport and housing.\u201d London currently has one very obvious limit to urban expansion: the green belt. Strict planning controls have forced housebuilding to leapfrog the ring of protected countryside ever since the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act. The government\u2019s National Infrastructure Commission, led by Lord Adonis, believes Crossrail 2 invites major housebuilding next to new stations on London\u2019s outer fringes. A recent report recommends the \u201climited release\u201d of green-belt land for development.  Yet the idea remains politically toxic. London\u2019s new mayor Sadiq Khan promised to protect the green belt in the outer boroughs during his campaign. He also promised to freeze TfL fares, a claim which all commuters will be keeping a close eye on. Richard Wellings, transport expert at the Institute for Economic Affairs, thinks this precious green belt is \u201cillogical\u201d, pushing too many people to leapfrog over it and live inefficiently far from the nation\u2019s biggest source of jobs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d he says. Still, Wellings has little sympathy with commuters who complain about living 30 or 40 miles from the office. He thinks the taxpayer is partially subsidising their lifestyle, since price regulations hold down a proportion of fares. \u201cI think commuters\u2019 frustration is misguided,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople could make a trade-off and move to a smaller house in a rougher part of east London, and still have lower overall living costs. But they choose to live in the leafy stockbroker belt, because of the schools, a bigger house and so on. New migrants to the city show it\u2019s possible to live much closer to work, even if a lot of people don\u2019t want to rough it.\u201d Christian Wolmar, a transport writer who initially competed for Labour\u2019s nomination for mayor, disagrees. \u201cWhat are people expected to do? House prices in London are pricing people out, so a lot of people don\u2019t feel they have much of a choice. And London can\u2019t function without those workers coming in to the city. We need to subsidise an improved rail system for a very good reason \u2013 it\u2019s an essential part of the economy.\u201d   Related: London, reimagined: alternative tube maps \u2013 in pictures    If London cannot spread out into the green belt, the city will also follow the model of Asian cities and expand upwards ever higher. The capital now has 436 buildings over 20 storeys in the pipeline, but skyscraper development remains deeply unpopular, inspiring endless laments that London is turning into \u201cDubai on the Thames\u201d. On the right, lobby groups such as Create Streets attack high-rise development for establishing alienating environments, while the left despises the glut of luxury towers aimed at overseas investors. For the time being, at least, wild house prices and crazy rents mean a growing number of London\u2019s workers feel forced to live far from the action. Others make the choice willingly, happy to live somewhere more affordable and put some space between themselves and the heaving, noisy city. They simply want the long commute to be less miserable; they want to feel good about making a smart trade-off. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to feel good when you\u2019re 20 minutes late, squashed between one stranger\u2019s armpit and another\u2019s elbow, and spending a small fortune on the privilege.
