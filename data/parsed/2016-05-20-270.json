  "body": "Look, guys, I\u2019m not your mum, but that\u2019s never stopped me telling you what to do, nor should it. You may have attended many festivals in your time, or maybe this year is your very first \u2013 either way you will find lots of publications trying to give you advice, like \u201cOooh, wellington boots are helpful in the mud,\u201d or \u201cHave you thought about making a detailed itinerary so you maximise your fun?\u201d. Well, shut up other publications, because I\u2019m here in the Guardian with proper tips for actual cool cats. The kind who eat itineraries for breakfast. And lunch, and dinner, and then get scurvy. There are more important things to think about in the runup to music-in-a-field fun time, so here are my golden rules for festival season. 1) Miss the main artist First off, take note: \u201cartist\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean a good painter: it can also be used about a musician, when you\u2019ve paid a lot of money to see them. That\u2019s a good piece of new knowledge right there. Secondly, it is very important to miss the headliner/legend at a festival, so that you have a great story to tell when they die a year later. \u201cBowie, yeah I would have seen him at Glastonbury* but I, er, followed a girl who looked like a brave squirrel to watch a little-known band called Toilet Time in a ditch. Regretting that now of course.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d all your friends think, \u201cthat Rachel knows how to live spontaneously, what a great anecdote!\u201d 2) Stay away from drugs     The police do go to festivals, you know \u2026 Photograph: Tabatha Fireman/Redferns    I hate to be the first to break this to you, but some people do drugs. \u201cEven though they\u2019re illegal and their parents clearly asked them not to?\u201d Yes. I\u2019m sorry: it\u2019s an awful world out there. At a festival, drugs make people gurny and silly and they scare the children and ruin it for everyone. Thank gosh the police have come up with a scheme to crack down on this, by going undercover as teenage girls in denim shorts. The smaller the shorts, the higher the ranking officer. Girls in angel wings are special branch. They are covering every single music festival this year, plus village fetes, cinemas and shopping centres. So please be good, as I won\u2019t be coming to visit you in prison. 3) Stand out from the crowd There are between three and 3 million people at any festival, and you want to make sure you shine like the star you are. Plus, you want your friends to be able to find you when you fall in a puddle and can\u2019t get out. For this reason avoid fancy dress, animal face paints and holding a big flag \u2013 without them, you\u2019ll stand out a mile. You might even think about wearing a full business suit in a dark colour. Don\u2019t do it, though, just think about it. 4) Be kind to strangers Of course, in real life, strangers, or \u201cpeople you don\u2019t know\u201d are awful and should be spat at, but at a festival people often lose their friends (because they are wearing fancy dress, animal face paints and holding a large flag) and it is your job to make them feel like the world is one big tribe where everyone is welcome. Like once, at Latitude, my friend Joel left a girl with me because he didn\u2019t want to get off with her any more, and rather than ignoring her as I would have done in some local nightclub, I asked if she was OK and then continued dancing. Over the next few hours I nodded at her sometimes. Obviously I haven\u2019t told you this just to illustrate what a great person I am (\u201cYou\u2019re a sexy girl, Jesus!\u201d I hear the people cry) but more importantly to recommend you steer clear of Joel. He will only hurt you, Babes. 5) Brace yourself for the toilet     You only need visit the \u2018toilets\u2019 for no 2s. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images    It\u2019s important to be in touch with your body. You need to know your inner rhythms (ask your doctor) so that you can start queuing for the shit-tardis about an hour/90 minutes before you need to go. You will also need to be good at repressing the memories of the things you saw and smelled in there. If you know someone with a Men in Black memory zapper thing, ask if you can borrow it. If you do get post-traumatic toilet disorder, make sure you get signed off from work for at least a week, although the flashbacks could last for a couple of months. It\u2019s worth noting that you only need visit the \u201ctoilets\u201d for number twos. Number ones (pisses) can be done anywhere, as you are \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you noticed \u2013 outside. Or, if you dance a lot, you can sweat the urine out using your skin as a second bladder**. 6) Don\u2019t ask why there\u2019s a comedy tent A tent? With a comedian in it? Surely, comedy works best in a packed, hot, low-ceilinged room and not in a billowing tarpaulin structure reverberating with distorted bass from the metal band on the main stage, and empty apart from a family picnicking 100m away from the stage? Who cares, festivals have to provide entertainment that isn\u2019t music just in case a family need somewhere to shelter while enjoying their picnic. See you there. 7) Be prepared to spend a lot of money I know you\u2019re rich because you can afford to go to a festival. It\u2019s damn expensive to get a weekend ticket to any of the big ones and that\u2019s because they have to make sure you\u2019re wealthy before you get in. A little bit like that scene in Pretty Woman (popular 80s prostitute film), where the lady wasn\u2019t allowed into the nice shop because of her stinky clothes, there is no point attending a festival if you can\u2019t shell out \u00a3160 for a lentil burger. You\u2019re not even allowed to moan about it in case you seem like a party pooper (another thing to watch out for in the toilets). 8) Don\u2019t bring a poisonous snake I shouldn\u2019t have to explain this. Don\u2019t bring a scary spider either. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s your friend. No, I haven\u2019t run out of ideas. Well, that\u2019s not what your mum said last night. 9) Make an early exit     Queuing traffic outside Glastonbury festival. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA    You\u2019re not allowed to live at the festival, so you have to go back home when it\u2019s finished. If you\u2019ve driven a car there, leave a bit earlier than everyone else to avoid jams and queueing \u2013 45 minutes after you arrive should be perfect. If you\u2019ve caught the train, go and sit in first class on the way home: you will smell so bad the ticket inspector will avoid you. 10) Tell everyone it was brilliant The most important thing about huge, long-planned events is that we brag to friends, relatives and colleagues who weren\u2019t there about how great it was. By doing so we maintain the illusion that loud noises and bright outfits can distract us from our loneliness/mortality, thus keeping the whole entertainment industry going. You will sometimes feel sad at a festival; it\u2019s not all euphoria and laughing because \u2013 despite the unusual environment \u2013 you will still be you. But you will get a bit of exercise from the walking and jiggling, lots of fresh air and plenty of lentils. So it\u2019s still worth going. * I dunno if he played there, I\u2019m not going to look it up. ** Science. Sara Pascoe will be performing at Latitude, Reading, Leeds, Port Eliot and Wilderness.",
