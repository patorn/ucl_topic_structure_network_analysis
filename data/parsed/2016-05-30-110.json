The unusual targeting of a Chinese worker in the sprawling port city will alarm the government, which is betting heavily on the $46bn China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC) to transform Pakistan\u2019s moribund economy. The two men were injured when a roadside bomb exploded at about 8.30am on Monday as their minibus passed through one of Karachi\u2019s industrial quarters. A piece of paper left at the scene was signed by the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army, an obscure group seeking the independence of Sindh, one of Pakistan\u2019s four regions. The note denounced the ruling establishment that is largely drawn from Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s most populous region. \u201cAs a rising imperialist power and supporter of Pakistan\u2019s cause we consider China equivalent to Punjab,\u201d the note written in Sindhi said. \u201cWe will oppose every anti-Sindh project including the China-Pakistan economic corridor.\u201d The security of Chinese nationals in Pakistan is a key concern to Beijing. In October, the country\u2019s ambassador demanded that extra precaution be taken to protect those involved in CPEC, something Pakistan has repeatedly promised to do. Although Karachi is a turbulent city plagued by Islamist militancy and criminal gangs, Chinese expatriates have not generally been considered targets. Anwar Rao, a senior superintendent of police, said the wounded Chinese man did not have security with him because it was not considered necessary. \u201cWe only provide security when there are tensions in the city and at their place of work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying our best to catch the culprits.\u201d The security of Chinese nationals has been much more of a headache for the Pakistani state in Balochistan, where a special military force has been raised just to protect CPEC projects from separatist forces. The CPEC investment programme includes roads, railways and desperately needed power plants. It is part of an ambitious strategy that Beijing hopes will not only help stabilise a key ally but also give Chinese goods access to the Arabian Sea through the deep sea port at Gwadar on the Balochistan coast. Three Chinese engineers were killed by a car bomb in Gwadar in 2004, an event that preceded more than a decade of nationalist unrest. Today visiting Chinese officials and workers only move around the small fishing town with heavy security provided by the army and police.",
