But now beloved play The Dresser is to make its return to the West End for the first time in a decade \u2013 despite writer Ronald Harwood admitting he remains \u201ccontinually puzzled by its popularity\u201d.  The Dresser, which tells of an ageing Shakespearian actor and his long-suffering but devoted dresser behind the scenes of a touring theatre, will be revived at the Duke of York\u2019s theatre in London in October. Ken Stott will take on the role of Sir and Reece Shearsmith will star as his dresser, Norman. Harwood, who won an Oscar for his screenplay for The Pianist, said he was thrilled to see the play return to the West End, but was at a loss to explain its longevity. It was most recently adapted by the BBC, with Ian McKellen nominated for a Bafta for his role as Norman. \u201cThank God for it. It\u2019s a lovely little thing \u2013 like having a private income,\u201d said Harwood.     \u2018I don\u2019t think a week has passed where it hasn\u2019t been done somewhere in the world\u2019 \u2026 Ronald Harwood. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    The play was first performed in Manchester in 1980 before transferring to the West End and Broadway, but Harwood recalls telling his agent at the time he didn\u2019t think the play would last beyond six weeks. Harwood, 81, said: \u201cI have no idea what its lasting appeal is, I really don\u2019t. It was my first big success, of course, and I do love it and am very proud of it, but I am puzzled by its popularity. I am still proud of the relationships and feeling within the play, it is a play about emotion; it\u2019s not a play about the brain, it\u2019s about the heart and that\u2019s what I like.\u201d He recalled, when standing at the wings during one of the first previews of the play in Manchester, actor Eric Thompson turned to him and said: \u201cYou\u2019re making history.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll always remember that,\u201d said Harwood, \u201cbecause all I thought was \u2018bloody fool, what crap\u2019. But I don\u2019t think a week has passed where it hasn\u2019t been done somewhere in the world. Very odd.\u201d Harwood went on to be nominated for an Oscar for his 1983 film screenplay for The Dresser, while Tom Courtenay was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of the title character. But despite having made a successful and award-winning career writing screenplays for films, most recently Quartet, an adaptation of his own work directed by Dustin Hoffman, Harwood said he remained far more passionate about the stage and was pleased to see The Dresser return to its rightful place in the theatre. \u201cFilms I do for the money,\u201d said Harwood. \u201cIt is very good money, no question about it. And we are overpaid \u2013 of course we are overpaid \u2013 but still, I don\u2019t complain. But writing for the theatre is the thing I\u2019ve loved doing most, because it\u2019s about language; relationships and language.\u201d Harwood still writes for three hours every day, and has just completed a film adaptation of John Le Carre novel Absolute Friends. \u201cI still have more plays in me but I never give myself the time to write them\u201d he added.  Harwood\u2019s latest project is a screenplay about the 1938 Munich agreement between Neville Chamberlain and Hitler. The 81-year-old said it had made him more aware than ever that the political mistakes of the past were just being repeated, particularly in the debate over the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fascinating film to research but makes me want to stay in the EU more than ever,\u201d said Harwood. \u201cYou realise the intrigue and jealousy and violence that was produced by nation states \u2013 whereas no member of the EU has attacked each other, and that\u2019s a bloody great advantage, I tell you.\u201d",
