  "body": "Even as North Carolina\u2019s governor, Pat McCrory, refused to comply with federal officials over his state\u2019s so-called \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, experimental pop group Animal Collective went forward with its scheduled show in the state over the weekend. It\u2019s not because the band supports the anti-LGBT law that limits bathroom access by birth gender. They are part of a growing movement by performers to take a different tack. Rather than boycott the state, as many businesses and performers have, they invited Progress NC Action staff members to the show, where communications director Logan Smith collected hundreds of signatures on a petition against House Bill 2. They have since offered downloads of recent concerts on a \u201cpay what you wish\u201d basis to raise funds for LGBT organizations. The new movement, NC Needs You, has lured major artists such as Beyonc\u00e9, Mumford and Sons and Duran Duran to come to North Carolina as planned, and turn their concerts into fundraisers and activism in opposition to the law.  Just after HB2 became law overnight in North Carolina, Bruce Springsteen announced his intentions to cancel a concert there. Ringo Starr, Pearl Jam and Demi Lovato followed. They made major public statements by cancelling their appearances. Similar boycotts from major businesses followed, modeling other states that have grappled with anti-LGBT laws, including Indiana, where a \u201creligious freedom\u201d law prompted a swift national boycott. But in those early weeks of April, Grayson Haver Currin and Tina Haver Currin, who work in media and advertising in the state, were concerned by Springsteen\u2019s decision and the boycotts that they were sure would follow. They wanted to protect service industry workers and others from being hurt by the boycotts and to strengthen the opposition movement, which is mobilizing not just to gather signatures on petitions, but also answering calls to crisis hotlines from young transgender people who feel threatened by the state\u2019s social climate in the wake of the controversial law. \u201cThe community feels embattled and targeted,\u201d said Matt Hirschy, director of advancement for Equality NC, the state\u2019s largest and oldest LGBT advocacy group. \u201cWhen performers go on stage, make a statement and stand in solidarity, they\u2019re saying to the community: \u2018They see me. They value me.\u2019\u201d Mumford and Sons were the first band to respond to the Currins. After building a website with the logo \u201cNC Needs You \u2013 Don\u2019t Cancel Your Show\u201d and a list of 14 nonprofit organizations in need of support, the couple found themselves backstage at a sold-out Mumford concert in Charlotte\u2019s basketball arena, where they spoke to the band for three hours about the fledgling effort. Several weeks later, the band announced on Facebook that it was donating funds to three nonprofit organizations and setting up a fund to support other causes. Several days later, Duran Duran also decided not to cancel a scheduled concert and the band\u2019s frontman, Simon Le Bon, spoke to another Charlotte crowd about his support for the LGBT community, standing in front of a huge American flag with rainbow stripes. \u201cI can promise you some politics-free entertainment for about an hour, maybe a little longer. And then, well, there\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have a little chat about,\u201d Le Bon told the crowd. In early May, Beyonc\u00e9 rolled into town. Although she said nothing about HB2 or the NC Needs You effort from the stage in Raleigh that night, the next day she posted a statement on her website, complete with a photo of an Equality NC T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cY\u2019all Means All\u201d. Hirschy said her statement generated a significant boost in visibility for the Equality Now movement. \u201cWe gained a thousand followers on Twitter the next day,\u201d he said.  James Miller, executive director of the LGBT Center of Raleigh \u2013 also mentioned on the NC Needs You site \u2013 said that increased visibility is important for organizations such as his, which provides direct services such as youth programs and confidential HIV testing. Since HB2 passed, he said, his center has seen an eightfold increase in calls compared to the same month a year ago. Still, he added, LGBT people in need of services may still be unaware of the center. Recently, heavy metal group Styx approached Miller about mentioning the center during a concert scheduled for 18 May. \u201cThis helps spread awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cSay a father goes to Styx, and he has a queer son. Now he knows we exist.\u201d Grayson, who is the managing editor for the local alt-weekly newspaper, says he is skeptical about state lawmakers repealing HB2, no matter how much pressure is exerted by activists. \u201cA lot depends on the DoJ lawsuit,\u201d he said. At the same time, he hopes that the combined efforts of the groups benefitting from increased support and visibility will lead to votes for more progressive candidates in this year\u2019s statewide elections \u2013 including for governor. \u201cHB2 is a symptom of a larger issue,\u201d he said. Larry Chavis, a professor at the University of North Carolina, said that many races for state office this year will feature candidates running unopposed, so legislators may have little incentive to consider reversing their position on the law. \u201cIn an election year, (this issue) has a certain intensity,\u201d Chavis said. \u201cSome folks here can\u2019t even get their heads around what transgender is. I hope that changes with time.\u201d And given the likely duration of the fight in North Carolina and elsewhere, Grayson hopes other places will adopt similar efforts. \u201cWe don\u2019t think boycotts are a bad strategy. Springsteen made a shot across the bow and it was important to draw attention to the issue. But in terms of long-term interest, momentum and financial support \u2026 maybe we have set up a model for people to adapt to their own situations.\u201d",
