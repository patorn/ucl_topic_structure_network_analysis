It was the eve of the 2011 Champions League semi-final and Guardiola came out fighting. What followed was a long, pointed monologue aimed at his adversary, a settling of scores with a touch of the title weigh-in about it. \u201cIn this [press] room, he is the puto jefe, the puto amo \u2013 the fucking boss, the fucking master,\u201d Guardiola insisted. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to compete with him for a moment.\u201d Now he will have to, all over again. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho versus Pep Guardiola has moved to Manchester. \u201cI know him and he knows me,\u201d Guardiola said that night. They had worked together at Barcelona, captain and assistant coach; had faced each other as managers on either side of the cl\u00e1sico divide; and briefly met when Chelsea played Bayern Munich in the 2013 European Super Cup; this time they share a city, a rivalry renewed. The two biggest names, elevated to comic-book or cinematic status. \u201cAh, Mr Pep, we meet again \u2026 \u201d perhaps, or, \u201cThis town ain\u2019t big enough for the both of us\u201d.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho can mould an exciting, attacking Manchester United side | Michael Cox    It almost feels as if it had to be this way; that once City got Guardiola, United had to get his arch enemy, a counter-reaction for every reaction; as if this was a decision driven by personality and status. Opposites who attract. On some basic, emotional level: if City have a big name, United have to have a bigger one. On a footballing one: if City have Guardiola, United have to seek out a guarantee, the one man who can stop him. There may be others who could, of course, but that is how it is set up. And so the pattern is repeated. When Madrid signed Mourinho in the summer of 2010 his mission was simple: to defeat Guardiola and bring down Barcelona. The mission stood before him daily. A life-sized cardboard cut-out used to be propped up in Mourinho\u2019s office at Valdebebas depicting him sprinting across the Camp Nou turf, finger in the air, celebrating at the end of the 2010 Champions League semi-final. Internazionale had reached the final, Barcelona had not. For Madrid, there was relief and revelation: Mourinho had rescued them from watching the Catalan club lift the trophy at the Bernab\u00e9u. Now he had to complete the job. The plan was one with which United are familiar: to knock their rivals off their perch. So Mourinho set about waging war, on and off the pitch. Conflict was his cause and it became increasingly personal. Perhaps it always had been: even Guardiola had told Barcelona\u2019s president Joan Laporta that it would be easier to make Mourinho Bar\u00e7a manager in 2008, but he had been chosen instead. Mourinho, who once declared that Barcelona would be \u201cfor ever\u201d in his heart, wanted the job. Then there was the task before him, an enormous one requiring shock tactics: Guardiola\u2019s team had won the treble in 2009 and the league in 2010. Only he had prevented them reaching a second successive European Cup final. Mourinho sought to break up the relationship that had built between Madrid and Barcelona players who had just won the 2010 World Cup together with Spain, telling them that he had been there and he knew that their Catalan colleagues hated Spain and would never truly be their friends. He bemoaned referees and committees, favourable fixtures and even teams that did not try; in short, a campaign against his club. Somehow Madrid and Mourinho were projected as the powerless little man, the victims. His campaign against Barcelona was relentless \u2013 even if he rarely referred to them by name, preferring to cite \u201cother clubs\u201d. He attacked their elevation to untouchable status and their image as the game\u2019s good guys, their projection of themselves as the sole defenders of \u201cfootball\u201d, as if no other style was legitimate. He railed against their \u201cpurity\u201d and blamelessness. He accused them of diving and pressuring officials, who favoured them. He insisted that, behind the mask, he and Guardiola were not so different, prompting the Barcelona manager to promise he would revise his behaviour. And on match days, he ordered his team into battle. Almost literally at times. The red cards received reinforced his narrative and it spilled over often. Most famously of all, he sneaked round behind Barcelona\u2019s assistant coach Tito Vilanova and poked him in the eye. When he was asked about it after the game, he claimed not to know \u201cthis Pito Vilanova or whatever his name is\u201d. He knew very well who he was, just as he knew that Pito is Spanish for \u201ccock\u201d. So the spiral spun, the century-old rivalry seemingly more bitter, more intense than ever before. Trenches were dug deeper, divides opening up even within his own club. There may be excitement about the two men meeting again in Manchester but by the end of the battle for Spain, it was largely tiresome and unpleasant. Perhaps a different environment, different teams, different demands, will change that. Or perhaps not.

When Guardiola departed, he was asked about his memories of the cl\u00e1sicos, the biggest club game on the planet with the best players. He had seen a 6-2, a 5-0, a 2-0 in the European Cup semi-final, some of the best moments in his club\u2019s history, but his reply was telling: \u201cI don\u2019t have good memories of them,\u201d he said. Others looked back on those four cl\u00e1sicos in 18 days in 2011 and struggled to remember the football through the fog. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bring Mourinho here to make friends,\u201d said Emilio Butrague\u00f1o, Madrid\u2019s institutional director. Those he did make were determined defenders. Some presented him as a crusader for the truth, fighting Madrid\u2019s corner; others as paranoid and pernicious. \u201cI don\u2019t fancy talking about him,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Iniesta told El Pa\u00eds. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that Mourinho did more harm than good; he damaged Spanish football.\u201d Mourinho responded by saying that Spanish football, which he pointedly noted had come to be seen as synonymous with the Catalan club, had been \u201cdamaged\u201d because he had \u201cended Barcelona\u2019s hegemony\u201d. In 2012 Madrid all but claimed the league with a 2-1 win at the Camp Nou, beginning a run of just one defeat in seven cl\u00e1sicos. Mourinho is the only manager in eight years to take Madrid to the league title, and in his first season his team took the Copa del Rey from Barcelona. Guardiola failed to win just four trophies out of 18 when at the Camp Nou, but three of the four were lost to Mourinho\u2019s sides. Yet, in two years of Pep versus Jos\u00e9 in Spain, Guardiola had won three major trophies, Mourinho two. A league title and a cup for Mourinho versus a league title, a cup and a European Cup for Guardiola. When Guardiola went at the end of the 2011-12 season, it was as if Mourinho had been orphaned, without a rival to fight against. Can\u2019t live with him, can\u2019t live without him? He ended up fighting with his own players, finishing the season empty-handed and 15 points behind as Barcelona, now under Vilanova, took the title back. If some Mourinho defenders totted up Guardiola\u2019s departure as another victory, proof that he had been beaten by the better man, it did not make Madrid winners. They might have learnt. Some gloated that Guardiola had lost it when he launched that puto amo rant in 2011, the night when a dam had burst and he gave some back, but what subsequently happened on the field suggested otherwise. Mourinho had broken him, some said, really gotten under his skin; he had finally cracked with all the pressure. But the response was planned and the following night, Barcelona won 2-0 at the Bernab\u00e9u, Mourinho whining \u201cWhy? Why? Why?\u201d afterwards, going off on a wild rant about the dark forces of Unicef and Uefa. \u201cJosep Guardiola is a fantastic coach,\u201d Mourinho said, \u201cbut I have won two Champions Leagues. He has won [only] one Champions League and that is one that would embarrass me. I would be ashamed to have won it with the scandal of Stamford Bridge and if he wins it this year it will be with the scandal of the Bernab\u00e9u. I hope that one day he can win a proper Champions League. Deep down, if they are good people, it cannot taste right for them. I hope one day Guardiola has the chance of winning a brilliant, clean championship with no scandal.\u201d Guardiola did win it that year. Mourinho has two as well. Neither has added to the tally since. They headed in different directions: to Germany, where Guardiola won three league titles and two cups; and to England, where Mourinho won one league title and the League Cup. Now, their paths meet again, in Manchester.",
