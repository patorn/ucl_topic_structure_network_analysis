Nine hotels are being built or restored around the city centre. Their arrival correlates with the huge upturn in holidaymakers visiting the Greek capital since a low point in late 2008, when Athens erupted into riots after the police killing of a teenage boy. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle, what\u2019s been happening in Athens,\u201d Greece\u2019s tourism chief, Andreas Andreadis, told the Observer. \u201cThe tourist industry in Greece grew two to three times faster than in Spain, Portugal, Italy or France last year. This year we expect around 4.5 million visitors in Athens alone.\u201d For an economy stuck in depression-era recession, dependent on emergency bails and seemingly locked in a perpetual fiscal vice, tourism is vital. A record 23.5 million holidaymakers visited Greece in 2015 \u2013 generating \u20ac14.2bn in direct receipts, or 24% of gross domestic product. In 2010, at the start of the country\u2019s debt crisis \u2013 which has seen it struggle to avert default and remain in the euro \u2013 revenues from tourism were \u20ac10bn, or 15% of GDP. The Greek Tourism Confederation, Sete, is predicting another bumper season for an industry that has long been the single biggest contributor to the economy and job market. Arrivals could reach 25 million (27.5 million including cruise ship passengers), which is more than twice the country\u2019s population. Economic recovery will depend on the sector to a great degree.      Andreadis said: \u201cIf we get 1.5 million more visitors it will produce an additional \u20ac800m in direct receipts. Such a positive kick that would come in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d Much of the upsurge is linked to Greece\u2019s safety record. Tourists are staying away from resort in Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey and elsewhere in the wake of high-profile attacks. Countries whose economies are also dependent on holidaymakers have suffered incalculable damage following a severe drop in arrivals. Travel advice from governments and fears of fresh violence are simply keeping tourists away. But other countries\u2019 loss could be Greece\u2019s gain. And it could not come at a better time: tourism provides one in five jobs in Greece, at a time when unemployment in the effectively bankrupt nation has hovered stubbornly around 25%. Youth unemployment stands at an astonishing 67%. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge but our hope is that we will see an improvement on record numbers again,\u201d said Yiannis Retsos, president of the Hellenic Federation of Hoteliers. \u201cTourism is all about positive psychology and Greece is a safe place in the south-east Mediterranean region.\u201d But while price wars have played a role in securing bookings this year, industry figures also worry about the leftist-led government\u2019s business plan and its appetite for raising tax rates.     VAT on hotel costs in Greece is now 13%.    VAT has jumped from 6.5% to 13% on accommodation prices and from 13% to 24% on food and beverages. An extra surcharge announced by the government in a bid to appease the creditors keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat was postponed last week under pressure from tourism officials . \u201cTaxes by definition work against business,\u201d says Retsos. \u201cThis is a sector that outperforms all others, but I worry about competitiveness and the product we offer now being overtaxed. In a recession it is impossible for businesses to absorb the total percentage of increased taxes.\u201d Greece\u2019s role on the frontline of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis \u2013 more than 53,000 men, women and children are now stuck in limbo in several places around the country following the closure of borders to its north \u2013 could also have a negative impact. Sitting in Sete\u2019s air-conditioned offices in Athens, Andreadis says the image of desperate refugees camped on island quays \u2013 and most dramatically in the port of Piraeus just outside the city \u2013 will also be a drag on the sector if the situation is allowed to continue. But sounding a rare note of optimism, the tourism chief said the deal Greece made last week in its long-running, and often turbulent, talks with foreign lenders was also cause to be confident. The completion of the review \u2013 and the disbursement of a further \u20ac10.3bn in emergency funds \u2013 would, he predicted, see liquidity and stability quickly return to Greece\u2019s cash-starved real economy. \u201cClosing the agreement will see the market stabilise. It will end speculation of Grexit, which impacts tourism in terms of prepayment [for holidays],\u201d he added. \u201cCountries with unstable currencies are not tourists\u2019 first choice. The return of stability ends that.\u201d",
