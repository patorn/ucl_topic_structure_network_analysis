The section of a newspaper, magazine or website devoted to what you\u2019re having for your tea isn\u2019t usually the stuff of online petitions or open displays of fury (unless you\u2019re arguing over the origins of hummus, cultural appropriation or the best paella). But all hell broke loose this morning after news that the BBC was \u201carchiving\u201d thousands of its recipes on BBC Food (part of the broader conversation about the Beeb\u2019s \u201cdistinctiveness\u201d from the commercial sector) was discussed on Radio 4. \u201cThe BBC is removing 11,000 recipes and people can\u2019t cope,\u201d squealed the Metro. Well, not exactly: users will still be able to access recipes if they have the dish names or urls \u2013 they will be \u201carchived or mothballed\u201d (given the uproar, the BBC has produced a guide to exactly what\u2019s happening). The hashtag #bbcrecipes has been trending all morning with the likes of Suzanne Moore and Owen Jones using it to make wider points about defending the BBC (\u201cThey can take our lives, but they can never take our #bbcrecipes!\u201d); while journalist and author Chris Eaking and Jack Monroe tweeted on the value of free recipes in an age of processed food, obesity and poverty. There were also several imaginative offers to reproduce the archive on other platforms (some more serious than others). What\u2019s cheering in the furious reaction to this row (we\u2019ll leave aside the big conversations about the BBC and licence fees, access to free content and competition) is how valued recipes are. With this in mind, we\u2019ve put together our own best loved and most popular recipes, with picks from editors at Observer Food Monthly and the Observer Magazine, Weekend Magazine, Cook and G2, including current recipe-givers Nigel Slater, Yotam Ottolenghi, Felicity Cloake, Rachel Roddy, and some from our own rich archive, which includes the likes of a fresh faced Heston Blumenthal.     A taste of summer: gooseberry pie from Simon Hopkinson. Photograph: Jason Lowe for the Observer    Notable recipes over the years Back in 2002, when people still wrote letters, Weekend\u2019s mailbox was full of praise for this recipe from Heston Blumenthal for triple-cooked chips. Much imitated, never beaten. The Observer\u2019s Nigel Slater is a man of many recipes. This grilled chicken with basil butter one from 2005 recently prompted him to say \u201cI sometimes think it\u2019s my favourite recipe of all\u201d. Felicity Cloake\u2019s method of road-testing techniques and recipes from a multitude of different chefs in pursuit of perfection is always popular, but never more so than when applied to everyday dishes. Witness this column, including her technique for frying the perfect egg ran (and ran.) In December 2011, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall did us all a favour when he shared his mum\u2019s shepherd\u2019s pie recipe. An all-time favourite, from 2007 \u2013 Dan Lepard\u2019s groundbreaking 100-page guide to baking featured everything you need to know, from pastry techniques to bread recipes (including \u201cthe easiest loaf in the world\u201d). Although Yotam Ottolenghi is often singled out for long lists of ingredients, this paneer recipe, from April 2014, features just two ingredients. Nigella Lawson\u2019s rhubarb meringue pie, featured in OFM, combines orange and rhubarb to spectacular effect beneath a luscious meringue topping. At Christmas, it\u2019s become traditional to look towards Nigella or Delia, and this chilled out Christmas from the former, featuring sweet potato macaroni cheese, drunken noodles and lemon pavlova, was anything but traditional.  Jamie Oliver\u2019s classic tomato spaghetti and strawberry and ginger nut ice cream signalled the start of a real interest in budget recipes back in 2009 \u2026 ... and talking of cooking on a budget, in 2005 in Weekend Magazine, Angela Hartnett showed us all how to cook well for a fiver a day \u2026 \u2026 and they didn\u2019t get more budget than Jack Monroe\u2019s 9p bean burger \u2013 born out of having just a can of kidney beans in the cupboard \u201cand a three-year-old who wanted a burger\u201d \u2013 which was one of the first and most popular recipes she ran in the Guardian back in 2014. This video talks about the inspiration behind cooking on a budget and includes the recipe. Back in 2009, Jane Baxter introduced many of us to the joy of stuffed courgettes in her summer recipe special. Simon Hopkinson\u2019s gooseberry pie, commissioned specially for OFM in June 2014, is one of his all-time favourite summer recipes and, he said, \u201calmost exactly how my mother made one of her sugary fruit pies\u201d.     Not just any beef sandwich: a twist on an old favourite from Nuno Mendes. Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian    How do you improve a beef sandwich? If you\u2019re chef Nuno Mendes, you marinate the meat in its own fat, cook it in oil and then serve it with \u2026 yep, some more fat. This recipe isn\u2019t the healthiest we have ever run, but it was one of the most popular. \u201cPie is a mystery restrained by pastry. Believe me, pie is your friend,\u201d said Fergus Henderson, presenting this excellent St John beef and kidney pie in OFM\u2019s 20 best comfort food recipe special in 2014. Indeed. Jane Baxter and Henry Dimbleby\u2019s falafel recipe from Cook will take you as close to falafel perfection as you can get without a plane ticket to Egypt. Adam Liaw touched a nerve when he published the five simple dishes and the mistakes you\u2019re making with them on Guardian Australia\u2019s food blog last year. In 2013, as reports of the New York Cronut craze hit the UK, G2 got Edd Kimber (winner of the first Great British Bake Off) to come up with his own fauxnuts. When Dominque Ansell revealed that the official recipe took three days to make, Edd\u2019s just became more appealing. Rachel Roddy\u2019s recipes are exercises in simplicity, and this twice-cooked broccoli dish is a case in point. Six ingredients, 20 minutes, eminently accessible, and reliably delicious. Readers voted this chickpea, courgette and pepper stew by Nigel Slater one of their all-time favourites.     Just perfect \u2026 chocolate cake from Felicity Cloake. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian    Cook\u2019s 10 best sandwich recipes feature from a couple of years ago included the droolsome Borough Market\u2019s three-cheese toastie from Bill Oglethorpe. \u201cYou may wonder if the world needs another recipe for chocolate cake \u2013 but I found it surprisingly hard to track down one that actually tasted, as well as looked the part,\u201d says Felicity Cloake. \u201cThis, in my opinion, is the definitive teatime chocolate cake.\u201d But just in case you need one more \u2026 this easy cocoa cake from Ruby Tandoh is one every parent needs up their sleeve come birthday cake time. For something rich and spicy, try Nigel Slater\u2019s red aubergine curry, originally published in November 2009 and included in OFM\u2019s most popular recipe special. Chef Jeremy Lee\u2019s hake with herb sauce was \u201cas joyous to behold as it is to eat,\u201d he said. OFM included it in their best summer fish special and readers agreed.
