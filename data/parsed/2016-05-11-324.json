  "body": "An original copy of David Bowie\u2019s second album has become the most expensive record ever sold on the record collectors\u2019 site Discogs. The original UK pressing of the 1969 album David Bowie \u2013 which was later retitled Space Oddity \u2013 fetched $6,826 (\u00a34,722), beating the record set in 2015 by Chung King Can Suck It, a limited-edition 12in by the New York band Judge, a copy of which sold for $6,048 (\u00a34,183).     Money maker \u2026 the cover of the album that broke the Discogs record. Photograph: Publicity image    The high price is almost certainly related to Bowie\u2019s death earlier this year. \u201cAs morbid as it sounds, there is usually a bump in sales in the marketplace for a given artist when they pass,\u201d said Ron Rich, Discog\u2019s marketing director. \u201cCollectors look to grab that piece of history, they want to own that a piece of the story. There are a finite number of that album and even fewer that were released under the title David Bowie \u2013 find one in good condition and you can relive that moment when you first listened to it. It\u2019s tough to put a monetary value on that.\u201d A posting on Discogs\u2019 blog noted that the buyer was unknown. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where this expensive record is going. I don\u2019t know who is looking after it now. But I hope, wherever it is, it\u2019s being treasured in whatever way the buyer finds appropriate. I hope that future generations will be able to grab it off the shelf and give it a listen, and I hope the first time they start side one they get completely swept away in the story of a man who was looking back at his home planet at a time when that still seemed like a tenuous proposition. Above all else, I hope that David Bowie\u2019s art continues to matter, because he certainly put a lot of himself in all of those songs. I want to see that part of him echo forward.\u201d   Related: David Bowie's last days: an 18-month burst of creativity    Though the sum paid for the Bowie album seems like a lot, it falls far short of the prices paid for other records. Even leaving aside the $2m Martin Shkreli shelled out for the single copy of Wu Tang Clan\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin last year, other rare editions have gone for sums that would buy you financial security. Ringo Starr\u2019s copy of the Beatles\u2019 White Album \u2013 numbered 0000001 \u2013 sold for $790,000 (\u00a3546,500) in December 2015. But even commercially available releases with no celebrity connections can fetch huge prices. A few early pressings of Bob Dylan\u2019s The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan contained four tracks that the singer replaced on subsequent editions, and a copy of that has sold for $35,000.",
