  "body": "Hosting a global anti-corruption summit on 12 May should secure David Cameron some global headlines, but building a reputation as a corruption fighter requires tackling UK domestic corruption with more determination than hitherto.  An example to follow is Lee Kuan Yew. On becoming prime minister of Singapore in 1959, he prioritised tackling the rampant corruption that existed and the country became one of the least corrupt in the world as assessed by Transparency International.  There is some good news for Cameron. Since 2012, the UK has climbed from 17th to 10th place in Transparency International\u2019s anti-corruption league, its score rising from 74 to 81 out of 100. This is an assessment of public sector corruption and \u2013 because public procurement, at at least \u00a3180bn, is the government\u2019s largest amount of spending and the top corruption risk \u2013 the improvement will be due largely to the creation of the Crown Commercial Service.     The OECD template for declaring conflicts of interest and a common ethical code should be used in the public sector    Despite the low level of such corruption, the value of contracts affected and, therefore, the economic impact will still be significant. To be on a par with the best nations, the UK needs to score 90. If this can be done by 2020, Cameron\u2019s reputation will be assured.  To achieve this, the prime minister must finish reforming the management of central government procurement, which appears to have lost pace since Francis Maude ceased to be the Cabinet Office minister responsible for it. All central civil government contracting should be done independently of budget holders, commissioners and policymakers \u2013 it should be done by the Crown Commercial Service. Line management of Whitehall department procurement chiefs should be done by the chief executive of the Crown Commercial Service or the government\u2019s chief commercial officer. There are no constitutional obstacles to this and it could be done within three months, with a coherent procurement structure achieved within 18 months. It could then gradually be extended to the rest of the public sector. Furthermore, civil servants should be prevented from moving to positions in companies with which they have had dealings for at least five years after any commercial relationship has ceased. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) template for declaring conflicts of interest and a common ethical code should be adopted throughout the public sector, applying to anyone with any influence over commercial decision-making. Each year they should sign them and record any potential conflicts of interest.   Related: The UK can learn a lot from Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore    There is also a lack of integrity, transparency and clarity for reporting suspected public sector corruption. To whom does one complain about corruption in the NHS or local government, for example in the granting of planning permission? The police investigate themselves and police commissioners have too few resources to have much impact. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, an effective whistleblowing policy is the best way to reduce corruption. The Singapore government created the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau to receive and investigate complaints. With one independent body to report concerns, people know who to approach and have confidence in it.  Fighting corruption requires specialist expertise. Cameron should replace the UK\u2019s confusing and rather chaotic approach to combating domestic corruption with a UK version of the Singapore bureau.
