  "body": "The remake of 70s sci-fi classic Westworld \u2013 which was criticized after extras claimed they were asked to sign a consent form that said they agreed to participate in \u201cgraphic sexual situations\u201d \u2013 will air this fall, HBO has revealed.   Related: High Maintenance: the internet\u2019s best web TV series is back    The cable giant will premiere the show as part of its fall offering and it will be paired with Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s Divorce (written by Catastrophe star Sharon Horgan) and former web series High Maintenance, which is about the travails of a Brooklyn drug dealer. Anthony Hopkins, James Marsden and Evan Rachel Wood star in the show, which was written by Jonathan Nolan (who wrote Interstellar and The Dark Knight), and is produced by JJ Abrams.         Westworld trailer    HBO says the show is set at \u201cthe intersection of the near future and the reimagined past\u201d, and that \u201cit explores a world in which every human appetite, no matter how noble or depraved, can be indulged.\u201d But the show was under the spotlight for its own alleged onset depravity in October.  Deadline revealed the consent form said extras could be expected to \u201ccontort to form a table-like shape while being fully nude\u201d, \u201cpose on all fours while others who are fully nude ride on your back,\u201d and \u201cperform genital-to-genital touching\u201d. HBO responded to the claims by releasing a statement which said the document \u201cwas created by an outside extras casting vendor\u201d, and that they were rectifying \u201cthe discrepancies in this vendor\u2019s document with our actual on-set practices\u201d. Like the 1973 film the action is based in an American Old West-themed amusement park where robots act out fantasies of the customers, and Hopkins will play Westworld\u2019s \u201ccomplicated\u201d creative director, Dr Robert Ford.",
