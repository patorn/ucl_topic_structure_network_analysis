  "body": "Ohio governor John Kasich has ruled out a potential third-party run for the White House, telling CNN that such a campaign \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel right\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna do that,\u201d Kasich told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in his first interview since dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination. \u201cI gave it my best where I am. I just think running third party doesn\u2019t feel right. I think it\u2019s not constructive. \u201cA third-party candidacy would be viewed as kind of a silly thing,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. I just don\u2019t think it would be the right thing to do.\u201d   Related: Women say Donald Trump is creepy \u2026 Hillary Clinton has a \u2018man problem\u2019. How gender gap could be decisive    The move comes despite reported pressure from former Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Kasich suspended his presidential campaign earlier this month after failing to break through among Republican voters as a moderate alternative to the perceived extremes of presumptive nominee Donald Trump and his closest challenger, Texas senator Ted Cruz.  Even as he fell hopelessly behind in the race to capture a majority of delegates \u2013 Kasich\u2019s sole primary victory was in Ohio, his home state \u2013 Kasich argued that Trump would also fail to capture a majority of delegates, and that the party would be left looking for a consensus alternative at the national convention.  As a longtime congressman with a turn as chairman of the powerful budget committee to his name, and as the popular Republican governor of a presidential swing state, Kasich hoped to emerge as that consensus alternative. It was not clear, however, how the fundraising and vote-getting challenges he faced as a Republican candidate would change if he struck out on his own. Whispers of a potential third-party candidate entering the presidential race have circulated for months, as a general election campaign between two nationally unpopular candidates \u2013 Trump and Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton \u2013 has shaped up.",
