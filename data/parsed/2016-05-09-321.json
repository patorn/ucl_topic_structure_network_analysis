Di Natale spent the first day of campaigning in the 2016 election in Petersham, alongside Jim Casey, the Greens candidate for Grayndler.  The morning began at the Pig and Pastry, a rustic cafe nestled across from Petersham Park. Di Natale, Casey and NSW Greens MP Jenny Leong were joined by a group of families, who they say are feeling the pain from the government\u2019s budget announcement.

It is a direct challenge to the long-serving Labor MP Anthony Albanese, and is a key focus for the Greens to try and pick up an extra seat in the House of Representative.  Casey has been a firefighter for years and is the state secretary of the Fire Brigades Employees\u2019 Union in NSW. Following an electoral redistribution of the seat in 2015, Grayndler could be a closer contest than in the past. In the 2013 election Albanese received 47% of the primary vote, while the Greens received 23%. The Greens are banking on narrowing that gap.    The battle for Grayndler - Jim Casey setting out the election issues in his seat pic.twitter.com/1MmYXpfFTI\u2014 Paul Farrell (@FarrellPF) May 9, 2016    Although Albanese has long appealed to the seat\u2019s progressive voters \u2013 a mix of university educated professionals, young families and migrants \u2013 Labor\u2019s policies towards asylum seekers have stung the party\u2019s base. In a press conference punctuated by the occasional plane landing at Sydney airport (\u201cyou get used to it,\u201d Casey says), Di Natale and Casey set out the Greens case as the party of difference \u2013 climate change and asylum seeker policies featured strongly in their pitch to voters. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to young families here about their concerns about the budget,\u201d said Di Natale. \u201cWe had no mention [in the budget] at all about the big challenge of this generation ... Dangerous global warming.\u201d Casey has been campaigning hard against the West Connex highway that the state government is planning to build through the electorate. Local activism, on this and other issues, will form a core part of his campaign. \u201cClimate change and how we\u2019re going to survive a planet that is changing,\u201d Casey said. \u201cHow we\u2019re going to start moving towards a sustainable economy, one which we\u2019re a world leader and one which guarantees our future ... this government and this budget did nothing to address that.\u201d  Albanese is not impressed the Greens are targeting his seat. On the ABC this morning he lambasted Di Natale for kicking off his campaign in a Labor-held seat, questioning the Greens leader\u2019s priorities. \u201cIf you think the parliament will be a more progressive place without me in it ... then by all means that\u2019s his priority,\u201d said Albanese. He suggested Di Natale should be targeting Liberal seats. Di Natale hit back at comments from Albanese, following suggestions the ALP might preference the Liberal party ahead of them. He said the Greens planned to give Albanese\u2019s seat \u201can almighty shake\u201d. \u201cIt is Anthony Albanese with the begging bowl out for Liberal preferences,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe won\u2019t be preferencing the Liberal party ahead of the Labor party in one seat. Our local branches will make decisions about whether they recommend preferences or not and in the end let\u2019s have a debate about issues that matter.\u201d Di Natale said Albanese was a \u201cdecent bloke\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s the substance, not the rhetoric, according to Di Natale. He says the Greens haven\u2019t voted to lock up young kids on Manus Island and Nauru. The pitch for Grayndler gives a flavour of the campaign Di Natale will be running \u2013 one he hopes will turn jaded Labor voters towards the Greens.",
