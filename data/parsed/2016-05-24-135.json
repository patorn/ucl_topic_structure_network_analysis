  "body": "Written for a 1960 television production starring Richard Burton, John Osborne\u2019s play has hardly been seen since. It deserves a theatrical revival, however, both for the fascination of its subject, which is an 1842 blasphemy trial, and for what it reveals about Osborne himself.   Related: John Osborne: a natural dissenter who changed the face of British theatre     You can see why Osborne was drawn to George Holyoake, a socialist teacher who in a Cheltenham lecture mildly observed that, since the church cost the state \u00a320m annually, the deity should be put on half pay. Holyoake\u2019s views were wildly distorted by the newspapers and, at his subsequent trial, he attacks \u201ca magic circle of orthodoxy\u201d that prevails in Britain, and a life-denying Victorian Christianity in which \u201cthou shalt not\u201d has precedence over \u201cthou shalt\u201d. But, although Holyoake possesses the anguished defiance of a typical Osborne hero, the play also conveys its author\u2019s complex feelings about religion. Osborne clearly relishes the eloquence of a prison chaplain who prays to God, over Holyoake\u2019s head, to \u201cmake him to hear of joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice\u201d.  Even if one wishes the play were longer and Osborne told us more about the historical context, Jimmy Walters\u2019 production handles the multiple shifts of scene with great ingenuity. Jamie Muscato lends the stuttering Holyoake the air of a man driven to articulacy by palpable injustice and Caroline Moroney as his wife reminds us that others often pay the price for a hero\u2019s principles. If nothing else, the play demonstrates that Osborne\u2019s social rage was accompanied by a gnawing preoccupation with religion.  At the Finborough theatre, London, until 7 June.
