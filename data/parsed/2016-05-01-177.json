  "body": "Everyone applauds Jamie Lloyd\u2019s determination to get new \u2013 by which he means \u2013 young audiences into the theatre. But does he really have to sell the soul of his material to do this? In Lloyd\u2019s febrile production of Doctor Faustus. Kit (Game of Thrones) Harington, often in underpants, gets lots of time to show his chest, a minute or two to flash his bum and only one spell at the end to suggest undoubted acting talent. Colin Teevan replaces Marlowe\u2019s unappetising middle section with some incoherent satire. The stage gibbers with spirits writhing around in grubby knickers. Jenna Russell is an acid, wheedling Mephistopheles, who provides an uplifting rendition of Bat out of Hell. Lucifer has a noisy time on the lavatory. And passes off his poo as a truffle. Is this intended as a metaphor? \u2022 At the Duke of York\u2019s, London until 25 June",
