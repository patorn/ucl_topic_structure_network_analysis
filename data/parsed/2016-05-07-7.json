Related: Cannabis users gather at London '420 picnic'    A 10-minute rule bill proposing the introduction of a legal cannabis market in the UK, something that would constitute the biggest shakeup of the drugs laws in the past half-century, will end its passage through the Commons on Friday. It was tabled by Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 health spokesman, and supported by MPs from all parties, as well as experts including a serving chief constable. Despite failing in his attempt to steer a similar bill through parliament when he was a coalition health minister, Lamb said it had achieved its aim, by helping frame the debate around the UK\u2019s drugs laws. \u201cChange will happen, it\u2019s just inevitable,\u201d Lamb told the Observer. \u201cWe will come back in years to come and see this was the start of the change.\u201d He drew comparisons with public support for an overhaul of the euthanasia laws. \u201cThis is an issue like assisted dying, where parliament is a long way behind the public. In an age when there is a lot of anger out there and a great sense that the establishment is remote from how people feel, these are two great liberal issues where there is growing public opinion in favour of change. I think it reinforces the view that parliament is unrepresentative of so many people in our country.\u201d Lamb\u2019s bill, co-sponsored by Lib Dems including Tim Farron and Nick Clegg, Green MP Caroline Lucas, Labour\u2019s Paul Flynn and Conservatives Michael Fabricant, Crispin Blunt and Peter Lilley, was shaped by a report from an independent panel of experts. These included Mike Barton, chief constable of Durham police, the retired chief constable of Cambridgeshire, Tom Lloyd, and Professor David Nutt, former chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. Under its proposals, cannabis producers would be licensed and their products sold in plain packaging. There would be mandatory provision of health advice to consumers at the point of sale and controls on the drug\u2019s potency. It is estimated that a regulated market could raise up to \u00a31bn a year in tax. \u201cThere are some people who say because we are uncertain we shouldn\u2019t act,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cI say because we are uncertain we should act. People start with a fear of substances that can cause harm. The instinctive reaction is to ban it until you see all the unintended consequences of that \u2013 like prohibition of alcohol in the US.\u201d Lamb said he had received only five letters opposing his bill from his constituents in Norfolk. He said it was striking that the bill had won support in the liberal press and had not been savaged by rightwing newspapers, proof that public opinion, at home and abroad, was shifting. Opinion polls suggest the majority of the UK public back a regulated cannabis market. In Canada, the Liberal government was elected on a manifesto commitment to legalise cannabis. Several US states and a number of South American countries now either allow the cultivation of cannabis for personal use or are taking steps to allow its sale through pharmacies.

Many experts believe the UK could learn from Portugal\u2019s experiences. \u2018\u2018More and more people recognise that the UK\u2019s drug control regime has been a public health disaster that has unnecessarily criminalised countless people,\u201d said Richard Garside, director of the CCJS. \u201cPortugal\u2019s health-based approach to drug regulation and regulated cannabis markets in several US states offer examples of how drugs might be regulated differently. Regardless of the fortunes of the cannabis bill, there is a growing sense that drug-taking needs to be treated as a health and education, not criminal justice, challenge.\u201d",
