  "body": "Jobs computers can't do have one thing in common \u2013 attentive, human qualities.  Dr Carl Frey     According to Oxford university economists Dr Carl Frey and Dr Michael Osborne, 40% of all jobs are at risk of being lost to computers in the next two decades. Though much has been said about the jobs that will be lost, Frey points out that we don\u2019t know what type of new work automation will create.  We have already seen a shift away from agriculture and manufacturing jobs; now as more jobs become automated in what Frey terms the \u201ccomputer recession\u201d, we will see the disappearance of repetitive, low-skilled work, he says. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know specifically what new sectors will create jobs in the next decade or two.\u201d Though there are three types of roles that we won\u2019t easily be able to automate, and jobs for the next generation will focus on these areas.  Social First, jobs that involve complex social interactions won\u2019t be easy for a machine to do. \u201cIf you think of all the social tasks \u2013 negotiating or taking care of others \u2013 it is almost unthinkable that a robot will acquire these skills at human levels of social intelligence,\u201d says Frey.  So careers such as teaching, social care, nursing and counselling are all likely to stay after the robot revolution. And although the diagnostics role of doctors is already replicable by machines, the patient-interaction aspect of the job is hard to replace. Creative The second type of work that machines won\u2019t easily be able to replicate is creativity. \u201cComputers are very good at processing problems once the problem has been specified, but they\u2019re not as good at generating new creative ideas,\u201d says Frey. So artists, writers and musicians will all be safe \u2013 but this creativity is relevant to the science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) sectors, too, meaning high-level engineers, mathematicians and those working in the sciences are also less likely to be be susceptible to automation. \u201cScientists and engineers need to have a very in-depth understanding to work out what to study next, which actually involves a fair amount of creativity, just as someone working in the arts does,\u201d adds Frey. Autonomous object manipulation In plain English, this means the ability to pick up and move around different sized objects. \u201cYou can programme and instruct a robot to pick up glasses, for example, but it will be almost inconceivable to have a general purpose robot that can distinguish between all the different objects in your home and pick them up and put them in different places,\u201d says Frey. So cleaners, gardeners and refuse collectors will be among the last jobs to be automated.   Related: Intelligent steps to future-proof your job against the robot revolution    The human factor \u201cThere are quite a few occupations and categories that we don\u2019t see as susceptible to a computer recession. But they have just one thing in common \u2013 they need attentive, human qualities,\u201d says Frey. Osborne agrees that the jobs left for our children are more likely to be creative, involve social interaction, or be physical \u2013 which are also typically the types of job we most enjoy. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence to suggest that as we get more automated, machines will do more of the dirty, repetitive routine work. The jobs left would be increasingly creative and social, which is something we find more pleasurable. So it is true that we will work in complementary ways to machines.\u201d One downside, however, is that as we work more closely with machines, the machine will learn to mimic what we do and gradually more and more jobs will be susceptible to automation. \u201cThat means we can\u2019t expect this balance between human and machine work to remain stationary,\u201d says Osborne. While the thought of machines taking over 40% of all jobs seems terrifying, Frey reminds us that in the 30s economist John Maynard Keyes wrote an essay suggesting there would be mass unemployment following automation of mining and manufacturing. \u201cAnd while it\u2019s true that all those activities are more automated today,\u201d he says, \u201cKeyes failed to predict the shift in the rise of the service economy \u2013 which now takes up most jobs. In the same way we may be missing something important today.\u201d Looking for a job? Browse Guardian Jobs or sign up to Guardian Careers for the latest job vacancies and career advice",
