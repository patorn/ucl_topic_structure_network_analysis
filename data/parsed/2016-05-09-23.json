  "body": "David Gold has hit back at criticism of West Ham United\u2019s move to the Olympic Stadium by claiming the deal will be beneficial for taxpayers and prevent the ground becoming a white elephant.   Related: How West Ham struck the deal of the century with Olympic Stadium move    Asked whether West Ham had got lucky with the controversial deal under which they will pay \u00a32.5m a year in rent from next season, the club\u2019s co-owner claimed \u201ca ridiculous stadium\u201d had been rescued from a grim future. It was confirmed last month the stadium will have cost \u00a3701m after an extensive \u00a3272m conversion to make it suitable for football after the London Legacy Development Corporation was forced to publish full details of the contract. West Ham will contribute \u00a315m towards the conversion and it was also revealed the LLDC, which fought to keep the contract secret in the face of a Freedom of Information campaign backed by a coalition of 14 supporters\u2019 trusts and a petition signed by almost 30,000 people, will meet the full running costs of the 60,000-capacity stadium, providing everything from stewards to corner flags. However West Ham, who host Manchester United in the final game at Upton Park on Tuesday night, maintain they represent the most viable, subsidy-free future for the stadium in the wake of what Gold described as mistakes made by politicians and London 2012 organisers. \u201cIt is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\u201d Gold said. \u201cTry to think of another opportunity. Manchester City \u2013 except they\u2019ve planned it with skill and forethought, whereas we didn\u2019t. We built a stadium that was built by a number of very arrogant people that had no foresight for the future. They built a ridiculous stadium but we have made the best of it.     A general view of the Olympic Stadium, London. Photograph: Steve Paston/PA    \u201cIt\u2019s just ill-informed judgments and opinions. I get that. Sometimes a newspaper will pick out and its headline will be: \u2018Taxpayer paying for the flags and the goalposts.\u2019 What a fantastic headline. It gives everybody a misinformation. It sends out the wrong information that they believe the taxpayer is paying for everything and they get nothing in exchange. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. The taxpayer is going to make a profit. It wouldn\u2019t make a profit if you tore down the stadium and put it into a 25,000-seater, would it? Come on, how many people are going to watch the world championship hop, skip and jump?\u201d West Ham have sold 52,000 season tickets for next season and Gold, criticising a lack of foresight from politicians, said that the club would give the stadium a new lease of life. \u201cWe are lucky in a sense that we are 1.6 miles away from an iconic Olympic Stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work if we were 116 miles away. So you can say we were lucky that they built the Olympic Stadium. And thankfully, to a degree, they are lucky they built the stadium in Stratford because if they built it anywhere else this would be a white elephant costing the taxpayer millions of pounds.\u201d",
