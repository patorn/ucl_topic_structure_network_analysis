The Barnsley MP, widely tipped as a potential future Labour leader, called leaving the EU \u201ca gift to Putin, weakening both Nato and the EU\u201d. He said Islamic State would not be defeated by \u201cpulling up a drawbridge\u201d, when a terrorist in Raqqa could instant-message a teenager in Reading. \u201cIsolationism will not defeat these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think otherwise reflects both a denial of reality and a poverty of ambition. That has never been the Labour way.\u201d   Related: Action Dan says he's not planning to parachute in to save the Labour party    At the Poppy Club in Mitcham, there was a surprise assault from veterans of the British army, Royal Navy and Gurkhas \u2013 most of them sympathetic to the national security case for EU membership \u2013 who repeatedly grilled the MP on immigration issues, one expressing deep concern about Turkey\u2019s potential membership.  \u201cI think it is fair to say that there is no prospect of Turkey joining the European Union for a generation at least,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cIf that were ever to happen it would be decades away.\u201d After his speech, as Kemp was swamped with selfie requests, Jarvis said he was concerned that the Brexit side saw immigration as a trump card. \u201cI think Brexiteers \u2026 see it as their strongest hand,\u201d he told the Guardian afterwards. \u201cDefining issues like the economy and security has not gone well for them. They will shift their focus. The stakes are so high; all of us who believe in the case for remain are mindful of the consequences of losing. I\u2019m upbeat about it but of course there are anxieties. This is the biggest moment of our political lives.\u201d Kemp, a long-time Labour supporter, hinted that he hoped Jarvis might have an even more important political moment coming up, maybe in a future Labour leadership battle. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for Dan, he\u2019s a very bright man,\u201d Kemp, recently back from filming in Syria, told the Guardian.  \u201cI understand the pressures, having been out in Afghanistan, which he would have come under being a commander. The responsibility you have for the soldiers you have around you but also the civilians around you is immense. So anybody who could deal with that probably would be a good leader of the Labour party, right now. If he can deal with conflict, you can be a very good leader of the Labour party. I\u2019m a team player though and presently [Jeremy Corbyn] is the leader of the Labour party, and a popular one too. But politics is an interesting game, as they say, a week\u2019s a long time \u2013 even a day\u2019s a long time.\u201d Jarvis, whose speech repeatedly linked his time in the armed forces to the benefits of EU membership, said Labour had always had a common cause with the forces, skirting around differences veterans might have had with the current leadership. \u201cPeople are often surprised that anyone who has served as a major in the British army could ever be a Labour MP. They shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause although there may be differences there are also similarities. Not least the basic belief that collectively you achieve more together than ever you could alone. Same in the British army. Same in Labour politics. And it\u2019s the same for the EU.\u201d   Related: 'You're not going to kill me, I'm a warrior': Ross Kemp's giddy brand of danger tourism    He said those leading the campaign to leave the EU would not feel the economic consequences as keenly as ordinary people, with a dig at the former mayor of London. \u201cWhen the true costs would be felt in future decades, those who have campaigned for their whole political career to leave, and Boris Johnson, won\u2019t be there to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere are people on the Brexit side who have waited their whole political lives for this moment, for generations they have waited to leave. And we do have to ask that question, why are some of those people, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Nigel Farage, why are they against the EU? I think we do have to ask the question whether [under] a Conservative majority government those rights we have taken for granted that ensure people are treated fairly in the workplace would be brought back any time soon. I don\u2019t think they would.\u201d Jarvis dismissed concerns that Labour was not taking enough of a lead in the debate, saying the whole party had its \u201cshoulders to the wheel\u201d. But he cautioned against risking the debate by making it \u201ca referendum of David Cameron\u2019s leadership\u201d. \u201cThat will come,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make sure of that.\u201d",
