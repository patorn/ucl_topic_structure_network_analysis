The Department for Education said Sats were aimed at identifying children who may need extra help. It stressed that the assessment was carried out over a month in the normal course of teaching, not in a traditional exam environment. But teachers\u2019 unions have complained that the tests are onerous to deliver and distract attention away from other subjects such as music, PE and art. Here\u2019s why parents, guardians and teachers are keeping their children off school for a day in protest against Sats.  1. \u2018It\u2019s a positive way to express our disagreement with government policy\u2019 Our five-year-old son, Wilfred, is on strike today because we feel strongly that kids are being pushed too hard, too soon. Wilfred attends a school that does all it can to shelter him from the worst of the Conservative government\u2019s approach to education, but there is only so much they can do.  Taking part in the kids\u2019 strike is a positive way we can express our disagreement with government policy. This day of fun learning is the antithesis of the prescriptive, pressured environment being created for our children by Sats and the acceleration of the national curriculum. The agenda of forced academisation puts good local community schools, like Wilfred\u2019s, at risk.  Our son is in year 1 and already facing phonics screening tests that we are being asked to prepare him for at home. This is too much pressure for a five-year-old.  We have explained the protest to Wilfred and he is very happy to take part. He understands that the protest is about government policy and not about his school specifically. He says we are striking because \u201cwe should trust our teachers\u201d. Today we will be getting together with other parents and children from school to go to a city farm for a day of fun learning. We stand together with teachers and other parents to say enough is enough, let our kids be kids.

We both believe that teaching children so they can pass a test is wrongheaded. This is especially true when children are in primary school, where there is an excellent opportunity to imbed things like critical thinking skills and creativity and to get involved in practical science, engineering, programming, cooking, gardening and so on. This can go hand in hand with learning basic reading and writing.  Making year 2 children learn by rote so they can take a test is madness \u2013 not to mention the disadvantage for children with learning difficulties.  My eldest child is in year 4. She is already apprehensive about not hitting her targets and getting her teacher and school in trouble. She has Asperger\u2019s and gets very worried about getting into trouble for doing the wrong thing. She struggles with her times tables and panics that because of this her teacher and/or her school will get into trouble. She\u2019s eight years old.

My eight-year-old was worried that she or we would get into trouble, so we had a longer chat with her about standing up for yourself being sometimes more important than following the rules blindly.            Parents and pupils protest against Year 2 Sats \u2013 video    Both of our kids will have an educational day with my wife and mother-in-law. They have all sorts planned. Most people near us seem to be unaware of this action happening today. Of those that do know about it most are supportive, but are not participating either due to childcare issues or not wanting to upset their children and their routine. There have been a few who have disagreed, but to be honest they don\u2019t seem to understand what it\u2019s about. 3. \u2018Creativity is being pushed out. Independence is disappearing. And fun is a special occasion\u2019 As a teacher in a primary school I can see the pressure being placed on teachers to make sure children can do the things being asked in the tests. However, in order to do these things for the test, the children are having their curriculum squeezed and squeezed. Creativity is being pushed out. Independence is disappearing. And fun is a special occasion. My daughter is in year 1 so not sitting the tests this year. However, what we see as homework, what she talks about her learning and the way the teachers at her school talk about what she has to learn is pressured. My daughter understands that today is a message to the government \u2013 to tell them that we want her learning experience to be amazing, enjoyable and fun. My daughter has talked about her friends in year 2 and knows about the things they have to do. She is supportive especially as a lot of her friends are meeting in Clissold Park to raise the profile of the protest.  4. \u2018Sats teach children that stress, competition and overreaching is normal\u2019 The reasons for the strike are concern over testing that is inappropriate and a curriculum far too focused on the tests before the year. A lack of arts, music and PE and areas of learning that are vital to health and balance. Sats teachchildren that stress, competition and overreaching is normal which can then affect the mental and physical health of the child and that is fine and what is expected of them. I\u2019ve explained it to my children. They are quite young and don\u2019t quite understand it, but it is good learning for them to know what a protest is. 5. \u2018Continuous assessment is the most accurate way of monitoring progress, not tests\u2019 Tests such as this have no educational value. My seven-year-old used to love school. This year she just complains about how boring it is. Attempting to teach grammar to children who are only just acquiring the language is ridiculous and pointless. She\u2019s working from home today. I suggested she wrote \u201cthis is a stupid question\u201d when she finds a test question she can\u2019t answer. Continuous assessment is the most accurate way of monitoring progress. What do you think of the Sats changes? And are you boycotting school? Or do you think the protests are unnecessary? Share your experiences in the comments below",
