  "body": "Rafael Nadal is eagerly awaited on court \u2013 as opposed to in court \u2013 in France for the first time since starting legal action against one of the country\u2019s former sports ministers over doping allegations. The Spanish player, competing for his 10th Roland Garros title, is suing Roselyne Bachelot for alleging he had dropped out of the sport in 2012 to conceal the use of performance-enhancing drugs. French fans of the 14-time grand slam champion know which side they are on, however. Romain Lefebvre, editor in chief of L\u2019Equipe magazine, said French tennis fans, particularly the young, love Nadal, who is due on court for his opening match on Wednesday against Sam Groth. \u201cHe is enormously popular and something of a hero. People appreciate his play and his personality,\u201d Lefebvre told the Guardian.   Related: Andy Murray gets angry to claw his way back from French Open disaster    \u201cNadal has always said how he likes playing at Roland Garros and that it\u2019s his favourite tournament and how he is grateful for the support he receives in France. He\u2019s shown a profound respect for the Roland Garros tournament and has won it nine times and that\u2019s made him very popular with the public.\u201d \u00c9ric Winogradsky, head trainer of the French men\u2019s team, told L\u2019Equipe: \u201cWe are all happy to see Rafa back to the form we have come to expect of him. Now has he rediscovered enough confidence? In my view there is still a gap but he\u2019s made a good comeback.\u201d In 2010 a team of tennis experts assembled by the French daily sports newspaper L\u2019Equipe, voted him the best ever Open tournament player on a clay court, closely followed by Bjorn Borg. Bachelot\u2019s comments about Nadal came after Maria Sharapova failed a drug test at the Australian Open in January. The former minister suggested that Nadal\u2019s decision to quit tennis for seven months \u2013 for a knee injury \u2013 was probably due to a positive drug test. \u201cWe know that Nadal\u2019s famous seven-month injury was without a doubt due to a positive [drug test],\u201d Bachelot said. \u201cWhen you see a tennis player who stops playing for long months, it is because he has tested positive and because they are covering it up. It is not something that always happens but, yes, it happens more than you think.\u201d Nadal has always vehemently denied doping allegations; this time he decided to sue. \u201cThere is a couple of times I heard comments like this,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThis is going to be the last one, because I\u2019m going to sue her. I am tired about these things. I let it go a few times in the past. Not more. A minister of France should be serious. This time is the time to go against her.\u201d He added: \u201cThrough this case I intend not only to defend my integrity and my image as an athlete but also the values I have defended all my career. I also wish to avoid any public figure from making insulting or false allegations against an athlete using the media, without any evidence or foundation and to go unpunished.\u201d Any eventual damages would be given to a charity in France, Nadal told journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s what you call a good sport,\u201d the celebrity magazine Pure People wrote. Bachelor\u2019s accusations are the latest in a long-running spat \u2013 in French a gu\u00e9guerre \u2013 between France and Spain over sport. In 2011 the former French Open winner Yannick Noah, writing in Le Monde, accused the Spanish of having a \u201cmagic potion\u201d. \u201cToday they run faster than us, they are much stronger and they leave us the crumbs. Next to them, it\u2019s clear, we look like dwarfs. What\u2019s happened that we could have missed \u2026 how can a nation suddenly dominate sport at this level from one day to the next? \u201cDid they suddenly discover avant garde techniques and training programmes that nobody else imagined? I\u2019ve looked and I cannot find any of these inventions listed or documented ... between you and me, I\u2019ve great difficulty believing this idea. You know what they say in the sporting caf\u00e9s (I know very well because I\u2019m often in them)? That those who win are those who slip through the net, who are quicker than the testers and use products not yet detectable.\u201d Nadal described the attack as \u201cpuerile\u201d. \u201cHe [Noah] knows better than anyone that it\u2019s stupid to say such things at the current time with all the testing that we undergo,\u201d he said. Of course, it is not only tennis fans who love Nadal; the French magazine Women\u2019s Journal declared the Spaniard \u201cvery sexy\u201d and 22% of its female readers voted him their favourite champion. Despite Novak Djokovic\u2019s position at the summit of the men\u2019s game, Nadal may yet upset the odds to win a 10th French Open title. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer favourite to win but it\u2019s just possible his favourite tournament might revive some of the old magic,\u201d Lefebvre said.",
