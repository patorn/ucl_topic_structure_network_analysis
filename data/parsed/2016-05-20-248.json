It will be the first time since 1945 that Austria\u2019s president will not be from the centrist Social Democrats (SP\u00d6) or People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP). Ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote, young Austrians share their views on the increasing popularity of the FP\u00d6, assess whether there\u2019s any way back for the struggling centrist parties, and discuss the key issues they believe are affecting people living in Austria. \u2018I can only hope people voted for the FP\u00d6 out of protest\u2019 \u2013 Lea Eisinger, Vienna     Lea Eisinger.     I had a feeling the FP\u00d6 would get a lot of votes in the first round of the elections, but I didn\u2019t think they would be this strong. I still can\u2019t believe this is the choice of so many fellow Austrians. I\u2019m from Vienna, where Norbert Hofer has a lot of support in the city\u2019s working-class districts. They feel the Social Democrats have turned their back on them, and it is quite clear that the SP\u00d6 failed to take the worries of the working classes seriously. They have now become the largest group of FP\u00d6 voters.   The district I live in has one of the largest migration populations in Vienna, but it still has many FP\u00d6 supporters. As the overall sentiment towards foreigners is growing more and more hostile, they turn to a party that doesn\u2019t even represent them. But they feel that less migration will lead to them being able to keep up their living standards. When I was still in school, some classmates of mine of non-Austrian descent already voted for the FP\u00d6 for that very reason. Our unemployment rate is rising and taxes are high. People have lost hope of a better future. I think our current centrist coalition government have got their priorities wrong for a long time. Social benefits and education should be the number one priorities but have been neglected by both SP\u00d6 and the People\u2019s party. More transparency and updated goals are the only ways the two parties will recover. I can only hope that a lot of people voted for the FP\u00d6 out of protest against the current government and not because they really support what they stand for.   \u2018Not a single day has passed since last August where the refugee issue is not a main news story in Austria\u2019 \u2013 Stefan Hechl, Innsbruck     Stefan Hechl.     My first reaction to the first-round election result was one of shock and disappointment, but a result of 35% for Norbert Hofer was not surprising. The FP\u00d6 had been polling close to 30% anyway, and the refugee situation had obviously brought a few more right-leaning Austrians to the polls. I live in Innsbruck where the Green party candidate Alexander Van der Bellen came ahead of Hofer, but there\u2019s a significant east-west divide within the city. The areas where students and more affluent people live overwhelmingly voted green, while the eastern parts with more council estates and working class communities almost exclusively voted FP\u00d6.    Austria is facing the same issues that affect people in other rich European countries. Education is constantly an issue of debate, as is the relationship with Brussels. Not a single day has passed since last August where the refugee issue is not a main news story in Austria. It\u2019s the coalition government\u2019s incompetent handling of the refugee crisis that has caused the mess they are in. Their plan to mirror the FP\u00d6 has backfired, and this can be seen in the presidential election. After all, why vote for a bad copy when you can vote for the real deal? There are calls for a dissolution of parliament, but I don\u2019t see this happening. The coalition will try to stay in government for as long as possible. They would face a disastrous result if an election went ahead now. The SP\u00d6 might move even further to the right or back left again, while the \u00d6VP will almost certainly get even tougher, perhaps preparing for a junior partner role in a coalition with the FP\u00d6 after the next parliamentary election.   \u2018It\u2019s going to take a lot of time and effort to regain the trust of the Austrian people\u2019 \u2013 Felix Artner, Krems  I come from the small city of Krems in lower Austria. The result in my district was 33% for Hofer and 22% for Van der Bellen, which is pretty much the average across the country. People are extremely disappointed with the current government, but more worryingly they appear convinced of everything the FP\u00d6 promises them. Another thing I noticed during the first round of the election is that there is a lot of pressure in small villages among the inhabitants. My grandmother who lives in such a village voted for Van der Bellen because she despises the FP\u00d6. When she thinks of the FP\u00d6, she thinks of the Nazis. Although my grandmother is a conservative person who has also fears about immigration, I deem her a very brave one as well. Austria was affected by the refugee crisis, but the government made the situation even worse by making a U-turn on their refugee policy. There is also a lot of unemployment in Austria. The current rate of unemployment is 5.7%, which may seem fairly all right, but for a country who prides itself on social responsibility it simply isn\u2019t.  In 2018 we will have parliamentary elections. If the SP\u00d6 or the \u00d6VP got 20% each, that would be a success for them. I don\u2019t think the rise of the FP\u00d6 will stop soon. Current polls show a landslide victory. If elections were to be held today, the FP\u00d6 would get 30%. If the government doesn\u2019t change drastically, they will get even more. It\u2019s going to take a lot of time and effort to regain the trust of the Austrian people the SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP once had.  \u2018People are longing for a change. The Freedom party would be the wrong change\u2019 \u2013 Marita Schett, Vienna     Marita Schett.     I\u2019m originally from a small village in the Alps but have been studying in Vienna for the last two years. My experience is that people living in the Austrian countryside are often more racist than people in the cities, even though they have less contact with immigrants. I\u2019m quite sure that some of my old school friends and family members voted for the FP\u00d6, and will do so again this week. I think they\u2019re afraid of what could happen if a lot of immigrants were around them. People in the cities live with immigrants and refugees every day and can see that it works. So even though there are lots of FP\u00d6 voters in bigger Austrian cities like Linz, Graz and Vienna, these were also the only places where the Greens had the most votes.  Even though I knew that the Freedom party had been getting stronger over the past few months, I was shocked at the first-round result. The result reveals the dissatisfaction that is getting stronger and stronger here with people longing for a change. But the Freedom party would be the wrong change. They always call themselves the \u201cfriends of the small people\u201d, but they do nothing for them. In fact, over the past few years, they have voted against a lot of things like raising the minimum wage and more support for unemployed people. I would say that most people have a very good life in Austria. In general, it is a good country to live in. The biggest political problem here is that the parties can never agree on anything which is why nothing ever changes. They\u2019ve discussed changes to the education system for years and never make any decisions. We\u2019re also the only EU country without any real laws for protecting non-smokers. The people have lost faith and trust in the government parties. They\u2019re looking for an alternative and find it in extreme right and left parties. If the SP\u00d6 and the \u00d6VP don\u2019t change tack, they won\u2019t be considered the big parties of Austria any more.  \u2018The people do not trust our government to solve our social and economical problems\u2019 \u2013 Marek Skalicka, Floridsdorf     Marek Skalicka.     I am from Floridsdorf, a district in the north of Vienna. Floridsdorf is a workers\u2019 district, where the Social Democratic party used to be very dominant until the last regional election in October 2015. Support for the FP\u00d6 has grown ever since. At the first round of the presidential election, Norbert Hofer received 38% in Floridsdorf, so my district was one of only five Viennese districts where Van der Bellen didn\u2019t win.  The main problem with our school system is that it\u2019s so old it leads to a lot of social and ethnic segregation. We are deeply in need of a school system with longer primary school ages, where the working and academic class is kind of united and the kids with migration background have more time to improve their German skills.  Generally, Austrians are known for diplomacy and finding a consensus, which is nice most of the time. Sometimes it can be very hindering when nothing gets done. From being totally paralysed in the first months of the refugee crisis to not agreeing on any solutions to the increasing unemployment rate, people don\u2019t trust our government to solve our social and economical problems any more.   \u2018Austrian politics without the \u00d6VP and SP\u00d6 is like imagining the UK without Tories and Labour\u2019 \u2013 Katharina, upper Austria     Katharina.     I live in a small village in upper Austria. Generally, upper Austria does have more FP\u00d6 supporters than other regions of Austria, most rural regions are affected in a similar way. When growing up, I remember being wary of the FP\u00d6, but it was easy to joke about them then because their supporters had nothing to do with my world. You would find them at their own political events, but they never crossed your path. Now people everywhere are speaking out for them, including many of my co-workers and even a few family members.   Not only do the FP\u00d6 oppose everything I believe in, but I\u2019m also worried about their heated and aggressive discourse that is deliberately set out to divide the Austrian people. While carefully representing themselves as pro working-class, in reality they aim to cut social welfare even further and extend tax benefits for the elite. It\u2019s the rich that will benefit from their politics. Their rise to power would be an incredible disaster for our country and our society. We\u2019re struggling with what I believe is affecting most European countries; increasingly lower living standards and plummeting employment rates. I believe we are losing parts of our national identity as certain sectors that used to be an important part of our social and economic structure, especially farming and industry, are declining and disappearing steadily. I believe the \u00d6VP will become irrelevant beyond regional politics. The SP\u00d6 is very much divided between the establishment and more leftwing groups. There have been fierce protests, and perhaps there is a change for the more dynamic forces to break away. The future is very hard to predict though. Austrian politics without the \u00d6VP and SP\u00d6 is like imagining the UK without Tories and Labour or the US without Republicans and Democrats.  \u2018The presidential election is a prime example of the increasing polarisation within Austrian society\u2019 \u2013 Julian Pallinger, Graz     Julian Pallinger.     In my city of Graz there is less rightwing support than in other areas of Austria, although a vote of 27% for a far-right political party is still quite substantial. Graz also has a pretty strong leftwing community, which further increases social polarisation. The presidential runoff will be interesting, not only for Austria but also for the inner cohesion of the European Union.   I wasn\u2019t surprised by the result of the Austrian presidential election. Frustrated would probably sum it up better. That none of the two candidates of the moderate \u00d6VP and SP\u00d6 were able to proceed to the second round is a prime example of the increasing polarisation within Austrian society. The electoral disaster for the moderate political centre can also be explained by their inefficient and inconsistent way of governing, subsequently causing resentment and sullenness. The success of the FP\u00d6 seems understandable because they paint an unworldly picture of a nationalistic and patriotic Austria without the threats of unemployment, globalisation and migration. Therefore they appeal to people who feel that they would be the first ones to be affected negatively by those developments. Social envy, increasing unemployment and the government\u2019s inability to modernise the education system has caused political polarisation across the country.  \u2018Support for the FP\u00d6 reflects a longing for stability, safety and prosperity\u2019 \u2013 Cornelia, Purkersdorf, lower Austria  Support for the Freedom party is nothing new. During elections in recent years they have steadily gained votes. I believe these are not only protest voters but people dissatisfied with the current government. And then there is the politics of fear. Of course you worry about the security of your workplace, your country, your children as well as increasing prices when wages and salaries stay the same. There is nothing better than someone who makes you believe if you vote for him everything will become better again, because he is going to take care of \u2018our\u2019 Austria. I think support for the FP\u00d6 reflects a longing for stability, safety and prosperity, with as little change as possible.   The government appears to be stuck and hesitant to push policies. Meanwhile unemployment is rising and our economy stagnating. The time of both the SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP has passed. Now is the time for something new, something different. Unfortunately, there are no big personalities in either of the two parties who could lead the required change. Either the major two parties return to their true values and start working together (which is the definition of a coalition) or they keep arguing and stagnate, until the point when someone else will use their weakness to come to power. Extremes in either direction always mean the worst for the people who have to live with them. For the final ballot on 22 May, I can only hope for Austria and the people of my country that enough voters decide for the \u2018connecting\u2019, which Van der Bellen clearly stands for.",
