  "body": "As a young actor, Sir Michael Caine was once rehearsing a play involving an improvised scene between two other actors, after which he had to enter via a door on the stage. In the tumult of the improvisation, a chair was knocked over, blocking Caine\u2019s entrance. Unsure of how to handle it, Caine asked the director what he should do. \u201cUse the difficulty,\u201d came the terse reply. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Caine. \u201cWell, if it\u2019s a comedy, trip over the chair; if it\u2019s a drama, pick it up and smash it.\u201d Next week, my classical song collective, the Prince Consort, is teaming up with jazz pianist Jason Rebello for a performance at Bath international music festival. Armed with a piano each, Rebello and I will be joined by tenor Nicholas Mulroy and mezzo Anna Huntley. We\u2019ll be taking classical songs and presenting them in a new way, improvised, while keeping some elements constant and \u201cusing the difficulty\u201d to create something fresh and alternative.  Schubert songs will have their vocal lines fully intact, but with completely improvised accompaniments from Rebello. Other famous songs by Brahms, Faur\u00e9 and Strauss will be performed straight, but with improvised links between the songs connecting major to minor, fast to slow, German Lied to French m\u00e9lodie.     Beethoven was well known for having improvisational \u201criff-offs\u201d with other musicians    It has been common for classical and jazz composers to look to each others\u2019 styles for inspiration \u2013 Bernstein, Ravel and Debussy all drew on jazz language in their scores \u2013 but it is less common to see musicians drawing from each other\u2019s genres as performers. We have mostly lost the art of public improvisation as classical musicians, but it used to be commonplace. Beethoven, Mozart and Liszt were eclectic, all-round musicians and not pigeon-holed as a pianist, composer or improviser. On tour, Liszt would take themes he had heard locally and incorporate them into his recitals. Beethoven was well known for having improvisational \u201criff-offs\u201d with other musicians \u2013 in a manner not dissimilar to the rival factions of the Pitch Perfect movies, albeit with less awesome hair. In classical music tuition, we are not doing our young pupils justice if we don\u2019t encourage improvisation at an early stage. There is an idea that in beginners\u2019 piano lessons you have to start at middle C and very slowly work outwards: \u201cthe tyranny of middle C\u201d, as my teacher Philip Fowke used to describe it. Only when you are \u201cadvanced\u201d can you dare attempt the really low and high notes. This goes against everything that a child naturally wants to do. My four-year-old sat down at the piano the other day and immediately wanted to explore the whole keyboard, especially the highest and lowest notes. Allowing beginners the freedom to improvise and experiment fosters an immediate familiarity with the entire keyboard and encourages both musical and physical freedom. So how can the process of jazz help us?  Sometimes, as classical musicians, we\u2019re so terrified of copying another artist that we are afraid to try on their stylistic traits. It is common for jazz musicians to transcribe solos from other players\u2019 recordings to add to their own armoury of ideas. It forces them to listen deeply to the music.  When you have stopped a recording on one chord 10 times just to identify each note, you hear all the elements in a much clearer way. You begin to feel harmonic changes between chords, rather than just playing them.  Jazz musicians learn and play along with their favourite solos; composers imitate other composers\u2019 styles then take what they want from each experience and add it to the ingredients that make up their own playing or compositions. Classical performers, however are often too scared to imitate, fearful that we might become clones. But surely it is worth playing along with Horowitz and Rubinstein, occupying their musical shoes for a while.    You have to follow the music, rather than have it follow you  Peter Katin     The performance mindset in improvisation, by its very nature, has to be in the moment; you can\u2019t be thinking back or ahead, and you have to react to what is happening in the present. Things happen too quickly to respond consciously and it has to operate from a subconscious level. Jason Rebello pointed out to me that when you really know a classical piece, the space that you can get into to perform it \u2013 as if it was coming from you \u2013 is exactly the same space that you would get into when you improvise. This can be a confidence-builder in any musician. To improvise you have to allow yourself to be vulnerable and trust that you can follow the music and let it take you to where it wants to go. The British pianist Peter Katin used to advise me that this was a critical factor in playing from memory. \u201cYou have to follow the music, rather than have it follow you,\u201d he told me. At Bath we are experimenting in bringing both our worlds together: drawing on our hard-earned skills within our own genres but merging the two in performance. We\u2019ll all be out of our comfort zones, but that is what makes for the most exciting music. \u2022 The Prince Consort and Jason Rebello are at the Wiltshire Music Centre on 25 May.  Bath international music festival runs until 29 May.",
