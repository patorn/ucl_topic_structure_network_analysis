  "body": "Things got dark this week in Marcellaland, perhaps a little too dark. The death of a child is always a difficult proposition for drama, particularly a primetime ITV drama. Which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it should be off-limits \u2013 only that I\u2019m not sure Marcella quite has the maturity or thoughtfulness to pull off such a devastating development.  Unlike a few of you in the comments, I think Anna Friel has done reasonably well in conveying Marcella\u2019s scratchy, grief-soaked energy, and I did buy her anguish over little May\u2019s death. But Friel\u2019s frequently let down by duff writing: the use of the child\u2019s mobile as a signifier of Marcella\u2019s sense of loss is as clunky and cliched a conceit as I\u2019ve seen on TV for some time. On the plus side, Marcella does seem to be finding some sort of momentum in its plotting, with its many storylines finally beginning to cohere. Only two episodes to go now, airing back-to-back on Monday and Tuesday next week. Can this infuriating series stick the landing? Detective. Witness. Suspect The death of May was preceded by an admittedly actually quite exciting chase around London, led by Marcella in full maverick cop mode \u2013 pinching her superior\u2019s vehicle, opening the boot of a burning car and generally looking a bit wide-eyed and frantic. The reason for this level of agitation soon became clear when she found May face down in the wastelands by City airport and, while attempting to resuscitate her, started whispering \u201ccome on Juliette\u201d. We\u2019ve all long since figured out the significance of Juliette \u2013 lord knows it\u2019s been strung out \u2013 but the grim details of what happened to Marcella\u2019s daughter still remain elusive. Was Juliette abducted like May? And did an act of negligence, like May\u2019s father\u2019s decision to leave her unsupervised at home, play a role in Juliette\u2019s death?     Marcella and her team inspect the scene. Photograph: Amanda Searle/ITV    Regardless of the circumstances, it was Juliette\u2019s death that upended Marcella and Jason\u2019s marriage, with Jason beginning his affair with Grace three years later. Marcella believes she and Jason should have soldiered on, though Jason suggested things have changed irrevocably. Certainly I can\u2019t see them rebuilding their family life after all that\u2019s befallen them (especially given other predicaments in Jason\u2019s life \u2013 more on that in a moment). Meanwhile, as suspected, Marcella\u2019s involvement in the Gibson murder hasn\u2019t simply gone away because she\u2019s convinced of her own innocence. Mo, the taxi driver who, witnessing a woman dragging what looked like Grace\u2019s body from her house, began a long chain of events that led to his brother Hassan\u2019s death, is clearly convinced of Marcella\u2019s involvement both in Grace\u2019s death and the murder of his brother. He takes vengeful retribution here, breaking into Marcella\u2019s house (people are extremely adept at sneaking into houses in this show) and clonking her over the head with a blunt object. Thwack! Also under suspicion Yann is this week\u2019s prime suspect in the \u201cbag over the head\u201d killings. His DNA is found on May, and he owns the same tie binds and masking tape used in the other murders. Of course, I say that he owns them, but they could quite easily be his partner\u2019s: Matthew was linked to those threatening messages sent to Cara all those weeks ago, and is just about vanilla enough to provide a shocking reveal when we do eventually find out the identity of the killer. Still, Yann\u2019s the one in a holding cell for the moment, suffering some particularly brutal psychological treatment from Marcella, including some rather intense staring. Certainly Yann\u2019s an erratic enough character to fit the profile of a killer \u2013 we know about his issues with alcoholism and see a flash of his violence in the way he lunges at Marcella in the interview room \u2013 but there\u2019s also an emotional weakness there too, which might undermine that notion. You get the sense that Marcella isn\u2019t entirely convinced of his guilt. Other goings on     You\u2019re done for, Jason \u2026 Photograph: ITV    The Gibsons congregate for Grace\u2019s funeral, but there\u2019s another death they should be concerned about. Andrew Bailey\u2019s body has been discovered and the pathologist has figured out that the handful of sleeping pills that killed him were probably forced into him. Bad news for Jason, who unwittingly gave the nod for the hit on Bailey and is now trying desperately to cover his tracks by paying off Stuart, Andrew\u2019s killer. Unfortunately he decides to do said paying off in broad daylight with the cash wrapped in a remarkably conspicuous-looking parcel. Someone spotted him and is now blackmailing him by text. Even worse news for Jason: the man investigating Bailey\u2019s death is Tim, the DCI who\u2019s been clinking beers on Marcella\u2019s sofa, and who Jason threatened earlier in the same episode. You\u2019re done for, Jason. Stuart, meanwhile, is in some trouble of his own. His decision to tell his lodger Bendik to sling his hook hasn\u2019t gone down well. Bendik managed to crack into Stuart\u2019s computer and now has salient information on Bailey\u2019s murder, and is blackmailing his landlord. Bendik\u2019s price? To live rent-free at Stuart\u2019s for the foreseeable. Well, that\u2019s one way to solve the problem of spiralling rental prices. Notes and observations  So Yann has a lawyer present for his questioning, but Cullen \u2013 a convicted criminal who has been through this process before \u2013 doesn\u2019t?  Marcella has offered up some very funny bit players in the past week: last time around it was Claire Shaw and her computer, this time it\u2019s the wonderfully droll pathologist working on Bailey\u2019s murder.  I really enjoyed the unintentional black comedy in the big boss\u2019s suggestion that the team, shellshocked by the death of May, should \u201cget out of here and do something normal \u2026 Grace Gibson\u2019s funeral\u2019s at 3\u201d.",
