  "body": "Less than a week after a very public spat with his team-mate over who should take a penalty kick, Columbus Crew have agreed to trade Kei Kamara, last season\u2019s leading goalscorer, to New England Revolution for a record fee. The move was finalised just before the end of the primary transfer window. The move represents a coup for Revolution \u2013 Kamara matched Sebastian Giovinco\u2019s regular-season tally of 22 goals last season to win the Golden Boot \u2013 but suggests Columbus were deeply troubled by Kamara\u2019s disagreement with Federico Higuain during last week\u2019s game against Montreal.   Related: Sierra Leone\u2019s Kei Kamara: I missed out on Wolves move due to Ebola outbreak    One source told ESPN that the amount of targeted and general allocation money involved is in excess of $300,000, and more than the Chicago Fire received last year when it executed a sign-and-trade that sent Didier Drogba to the Montreal Impact. But it seems Kamara\u2019s row with Higuain was the final straw. Last Saturday, Columbus were leading 3-1 against Montreal when they were awarded a penalty. Kamara had scored twice and wanted to seal his hat-trick, but Higuain, the Crew\u2019s designated penalty taker, prevailed. He scored, putting Columbus 4-1 up, but Montreal roared back to earn a 4-4 draw. After the match, Kamara laid into his Argentinian team-mate for \u201cselfishness\u201d. \u201cYou have two goals, you\u2019re going for a hat-trick, a player that\u2019s never scored a hat-trick in their career,\u201d Kamara said. \u201cWhat do you do? Do you give it to him or do you take it? That\u2019s selfishness. That\u2019s not a team-mate. That\u2019s selfishness. Why did I lose the golden boot last year? How many penalty kicks did I score before Giovinco? None.\u201d The Crew suspended Kamara for this weekend\u2019s game against Colorado, but the forward was in no mood to say sorry. \u201c[Coach Gregg Berhalter] told me that this morning, and obviously I didn\u2019t agree to it all,\u201d Kamara said on Tuesday. \u201cI won\u2019t agree to it. But he\u2019s the boss, and if he says, \u2018We don\u2019t need you for the weekend. You\u2019re going to have to sit out for the weekend,\u2019 there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.\u201d But Berhalter was insistent. \u201cI said what is on my mind and in my head,\u201d the coach said. \u201cThe action of Kei, speaking out against a teammate, is unacceptable. We have zero tolerance for that. Therefore, he won\u2019t be playing in the game Saturday. Coach\u2019s decision. \u201cAnd then we try to move forward in the right way. We\u2019re a team that keeps things together. We keep things between ourselves, and that\u2019s why that decision was made.\u201d Kamara has had five separate stints with MLS teams, but has only once lasted more than two seasons, with Sporting Kansas City between 2009 and 2013. \u201cWe have been looking to strengthen our team and we feel that this addition accomplishes just that,\u201d Revs GM Michael Burns said. \u201cKei is a player who has had success and is a proven goalscorer in MLS. We\u2019re pleased we were able to get this deal done and look forward to Kei\u2019s arrival and integration into the team.\u201d",
