  "body": "The Rumour Mill is usually at its most plump and juicy when there isn\u2019t much football news to report upon elsewhere. When space needs to be crammed with half-truths and gossip, and people need their fill of news and so forth. So given there\u2019s not much else around today for anyone to get excited about, you can only imagine there\u2019s going to be some red hot stuff ahead.   Related: Manchester City \u2018agree to pay \u20ac50m release clause\u2019 for Aymeric Laporte    We could start here, at the good old Guardian, where there\u2019s word that new Manchester City head honcho Pep Guardiola is set to start the uphill battle of grappling the title from Leicester City\u2019s grasp by triggering Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte\u2019s release fee, which stands at \u20ac50m. It says here - here - that: \u2018The club\u2019s sporting director Txiki Begiristain was pictured in Bilbao last month, with Basque newspaper EITB reporting that City have told Athletic officials that they are willing to meet his release clause. \u201cIt is a specific request of Pep Guardiola,\u201d read the report.\u2019 On to other places now, and word on the street is that Wolfsburg, after releasing Nicklas Bendtner, have learned their lesson about signing lumbering Arsenal fancypants strikers who probably think they\u2019re a bit better than they actually are, and are\u2026 oh, wait, hang on \u2026 they\u2019re keen on Olivier Giroud. Hmmm. Yes. Well. Other targets for them Wolves \u2013 not them Wolves \u2013 supposedly include Besiktas striker Mario G\u00f3mez, according to Kicker magazine. Sound the alarm.  Oooh, here\u2019s one \u2013 France Football report that Liverpool are running the rule over Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Javier Pastore, a man who\u2019s mulling his future in France due to\u2026 well, largely due to not playing that many games. Just the 10 starts this season, all in all, and you\u2019d imagine young Javier more fancies his chances of dislodging Adam Lallana than \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda. Sorry Adam.  Andriy Yarmolenko. He\u2019s good. So good, in fact, that his current chairman thinks it would be beneath him to play for some of the finest clubs dear old Blighty has to offer. Well, sort of. Dynamo Kiev president Ihor Surkis doesn\u2019t think the winger will leave his club this summer, but if he does then it will be for one of the big dogs. \u201cHe is already a top player, so he should go to a top club,\u201d Surkis said. \u201cMy position is that we should not let Yarmolenko go to such clubs as Everton and Stoke City. Dynamo is Dynamo and Stoke City is Stoke. We\u2019re playing in the Champions League and Stoke City are fighting for survival.\u201d Well, they\u2019re 10th, but who\u2019s counting? How \u2018bout some sexy new contracts? John Terry wants one, and what John Terry wants from Chelsea, John Terry usually gets, but even this one might be beyond his creaking ol\u2019 limbs. Erik Lamela fancies one too, hoping to stick around with Tottenham despite their abject, disgraceful and catastrophic failure of a season. And Riyad Mahrez is in line for a spanking, shiny, digit-filled deal too. He\u2019s probably earned that one. And finally, here\u2019s word from South Wales, where the local journal has it that Francesco Guidolin has impressed Watford sufficiently that they are considering replacing Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores with him. The Pozzo family, Watford\u2019s owners, know the Italian well after he spent four years managing Udinese.",
