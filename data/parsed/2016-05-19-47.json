But the TV landscape could be trickier for Marvel\u2019s signature hard man than even the ninja-filled streets of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Bernthal should get a great deal of credit for bringing Frank Castle, the Punisher, to new life. He seized the chance to play a Punisher with more emotional range on the small screen than Dolph Lundgren, Thomas Jane or Ray Stevenson had in their respective films, and the Walking Dead veteran more than rises to the occasion.  Bernthal\u2019s take on Castle also had a more solid array of characters against which to react than the eminently disposable thugs prevalent in the character\u2019s prior incarnations. From the outset, the MCU Punisher is immediately placed as an equal to Daredevil (played by Charlie Cox) both physically and philosophically. His rooftop debate with Daredevil, while lifted from the Garth Ennis/Steve Dillon run that revitalized the character in the comics, is notable because Castle gets more of the benefit of the doubt in the televised presentation than he usually does in print.            Bernthal\u2019s Punisher also got not only a mental health-related hypothesis for his motivations, but the chance to flash some humor and even relationship advice in his interactions with Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) and Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll). But without being able to bounce off of superhumans such as Daredevil or a super human such as Vincent D\u2019Onofrio\u2019s Kingpin \u2013 and the failure of films featuring the character underscore this \u2013 Castle becomes another urban vigilante in a genre that has flourished on TV without him; we\u2019ve gone from Equalizer Edward Woodward coolly dispatching the riff-raff to Jeffrey Donovan agonizing on \u201ccrossing the line\u201d on Burn Notice. (You might compare Frank to Dexter Morgan, but Frank would tell you, \u201cI ain\u2019t crazy.\u201d And possibly shoot you for suggesting otherwise.) Remember: Castle\u2019s first comics appearance came in February 1974, just five months before Charles Bronson shot his way through a hellish New York City in Death Wish. There\u2019s no direct link between Castle and Bronson\u2019s Paul Kersey, but they do represent a similar reaction to a particular anxiety about the city, as critic Devin Faraci recalled:  The 1970s were the worst decade imaginable for the greatest city; it\u2019s all summed up in a famous Daily News headline \u201cFord To City: Drop Dead.\u201d That was 1975, and New York City was on the brink of bankruptcy. The federal government declined to bail it out. A shift in industrialization in America had hit the city\u2019s wallet hard, and had sent in waves of Southern immigrants, largely black. On top of that, the general national economy was in the shitter. Crime rose as the city decayed, unable to meet the basic needs of its millions of citizens.  Of the previous Punishers, Jane came the closest to inhabiting this kind of world \u2013 but only in an unofficial project, the 2012 short film Dirty Laundry. And that one worked in large part because it was short.  That makes it easier to understand why Bernthal\u2019s Punisher has multiple subplots to keep him (and the viewers) busy in his Daredevil appearances; having him spend the whole season taking on those hapless Irish gangsters would only have dragged him down. Devoting a solo series to him running down equally incompetent Foreign Mafiosos instead of the Kingpin also could feel unfulfilling sooner than later. One way to fight this could be for Marvel\u2019s showrunners to return to the Ennis/Dillon story for inspiration and have him confront not just garden-variety street toughs, but variations on his own quest. In a time when, as the Guardian has shown us, more of \u201cthe good guys\u201d are getting caught doing bad things, what would this new version of Frank do when faced to fight a distorted version of justice itself? Bernthal already has shown his Punisher is capable of more than shooting his way through a story. Here\u2019s to hoping his new series allows him to do so.",
