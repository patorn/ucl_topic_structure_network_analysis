  "body": "The son of a shipping tycoon accused of harassing the grieving father of a woman who killed herself, conducted a lurid and gratuitous character assassination of her online, a court heard. Alexander Economou, 37, sent David de Freitas a series of letters and emails over an 11-month period in which he allegedly tried to \u201cintimidate and silence\u201d him, following the death of his daughter, Eleanor de Freitas, on 4 April 2014. He set up a \u201chighly salacious and gratuitous\u201d website using her name to portray her as a prostitute, the court heard. Eleanor, a 23-year-old trainee accountant who suffered from bipolar disorder, accused Economou of rape in 2013. No case was brought to court. Economou responded by bringing a private prosecution against Eleanor for making false claims, which was taken over by the Crown Prosecution Service. The young woman\u2019s body was found by her mother, at the family home, three days before the case accusing her of perverting the course of justice was due to begin. William Emlyn Jones, prosecuting, told Westminster magistrates court the alleged harassment campaign against David de Freitas began on 6 November, with a letter that arrived late at night before he was due to give evidence at his daughter\u2019s inquest. He was also due, the court heard, to give an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, to begin a campaign against the CPS decision to prosecute his daughter and against the way defendants with mental health issues are treated. The CPS was forced to defend its decision to pursue Eleanor for perverting the course of justice, after she died. The letter from Economou, which was delivered by hand, warned David de Freitas to \u201ckeep quiet or face the consequences\u201d the court heard. \u201cThe effect of the letter was to make him feel very frightened and intimated,\u201d Jones said. Giving evidence on Thursday, a visibly emotional de Freitas said the letter \u201ctook me back to a very difficult time\u201d. As Economou, in a grey suit, white shirt and tie, looked on from the dock, de Freitas said: \u201cI realised this was the man who had spent a considerable among of money prosecuting my daughter and I thought; \u2018Oh my God, he\u2019s coming after me now\u2019. And all I\u2019m trying to do is hold the CPS to account. It reminded me of all the stress Eleanor had gone though. It made me fearful for myself, for Miranda (his wife).\u201d At one point, after a long pause in his evidence, de Freitas was asked by the judge if he would like to take a break.  De Freitas said he believed the purpose of the letter was: \u201cTo shut me up, to prevent me from saying anything. To intimidate me, to besmirch Eleanor\u2019s name, to hurt me in any way he can as a father.\u201d Asked how he felt about allegations in the letter from Economou that his daughter was a prostitute, de Freitas said: \u201cAppalling. In a funny sort of way, I was glad she wasn\u2019t there to witness that.\u201d De Freitas said that he had never named Economou, as he had been instructed not to do so and that he was not the focus of his campaign. \u201cThere were two focusses of my attention,\u201d said de Freitas. \u201cPrincipally the CPS but the way defendants with mental health issues are treated.\u201d He said that sending the letters and emails, Economou showed no understanding of their grief. \u201cI felt there was no consideration or feeling for the fact that we had lost our daughter only six months previously. It was just ghastly.\u201d Earlier, Jones told the court how Economou created a website \u201ceffectively hijacking her name to castigate her in the eyes of the public as a prostitute\u201d. It also had CCTV footage of Economou and de Freitas buying sex toys. De Freitas said he was \u201cstunned\u201d when Economou sent him a link to the site. \u201cI was utterly stunned that anybody that could set up a website and put that kind of stuff on it, but to use my dead daughter\u2019s name. Words fail me ... how someone could be that inhuman.\u201d He said Economou used the date of his daughter\u2019s birthday to update the website. De Freitas described the cumulative effect of the series of emails, also sent to his solicitor Harriet Wistrich, of Birnberg Peirce, as a \u201cdripping tap. More and more pressure, until he got his way.\u201d The court was read details from the letter Economou sent on 6 November. In it, Economou said: \u201cEleanor and I went on a date. The following day, I did some internet searching and found out she was a prostitute.\u201d It said he then told her he did not want to see her again and, as \u201crevenge\u201d, she had gone to the police with a false rape allegation. The letter also claimed she had done this to another man, the court heard. Jones told the court that in some of the emails Economou sent to Wistrich, he told her to stop her client portraying him in the media as a rapist, even though (David) de Freitas had not named him in any interviews. He threatened to publish CCTV of him and Eleanor de Freitas at an Ann Summers store together after purchasing \u00a3340 worth of sex toys.  In one email Economou allegedly wrote: \u201cI am the victim of a very serious crime, anything that shows the opposite of the facts will be taken very seriously and legal action will be taken.\u201d Economou, of King\u2019s Road, London, allegedly went on to upload various recordings and comments on to websites such as YouTube, Vimeo and liveleaks.com. Jones invited the judge to consider whether this was \u201canything other than highly distressing\u201d to her family. An alternative course of action to a false accusation of rape, would have been to \u201cmaintain a dignified silence\u201d or to issue a denial, he said. One email, sent with the words \u201cfinal warning\u201d in the subject line, on the 13 December, told Wistrich to tell her client to: \u201cShut the fuck up\u201d, and warned: \u201cHis next libel will be very expensive.\u201d \u201cThis is not about clearing his own name but punitive consequences for Mr de Freitas,\u201d said Jones. \u201cMore than just unpleasant, more than just unreasonable, but oppressive and unacceptable.\u201d The court heard Economou believed he had been libelled by a series of articles including details of Eleanor\u2019s accusation of rape, and each of his emails were a\u201creaction to [Mr de Freitas] speaking to the press\u201d. De Freitas had not given details of Economou\u2019s name but it appeared in an article in the Daily Mail. David Lee, defending, said Economou \u201cfelt he had no way\u201d of getting across his point of view. \u201cIt was not designed to cause distress or alarm or harass anyone,\u201d he said. The inquest into de Freitas\u2019s death found that her impending trial for perverting the course of justice was a \u201cstressor\u201d in her life when she killed herself at the family home in Fulham on 4 April 2014. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide. Economou denies a charge of harrassment without violence between 5 November 2014 and 10 October 2015. Economou is taking a defamation case against de Freitas for claims he made in the media. A court ordered that Economou must not publish anything about Eleanor or David de Freitas. The trial will conclude on Friday.",
