First, it was Jay Z under fire on the \u201cvisual album\u201d; now, Knowles has taken the Miami police force to task after they said they would boycott her concerts. In a class A power play, T-shirts sold on the merch stand of her Formation tour read: \u201cBoycott Beyonc\u00e9\u201d. Just like that, Beyonc\u00e9 once again comes out on top.     Beyonc\u00e9 is selling BOYCOTT BEYONC\u00c9 t-shirts as tour merch \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/zjD3HcV7XG\u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 Australia (@BeyonceAUS) April 27, 2016    Moves such as this show not only that Beyonc\u00e9 (or her team) is a master of modern marketing, but that merch has gone from a side note to a fashion statement. By wearing those two words on your T-shirt \u2013 especially in a selfie on Instagram \u2013 you\u2019re telling the world that you\u2019re in on the joke, you\u2019re informed about the pop-culture news cycle and you\u2019re on #TeamBeyonce.     Justin Bieber tour merchandise.    These meta moments are all over merch now. Mariah Carey sold cuddly lambs on her tour because her fans call themselves lambs, while Justin Bieber\u2019s Purpose tour saw him collaborate with Fear of God designer Jerry Lorenzo. Lorenzo is responsible for Ts worn by Kanye West and Bieber that owe more than a little to Guns\u2019n\u2019Roses T-shirts of the 90s. Selena Gomez, now working with stylist Kate Young, has gone full Almost Famous groupie with her merch: denim cut-offs complete with patches. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly credible for fans and as exciting as an album drop,\u201d says Owen Myers, UK editor of the Fader. \u201cThat\u2019s for two reasons: because it\u2019s being responsive to what\u2019s being said online; and it\u2019s a genuine collaborative process with fashionable people.\u201d     Selina Gomez merchandise. Photograph: PR Company Handout    Some musicians are entering the grey area beyond merch \u2013 making their own fashion line. See Beyonc\u00e9 (her again) with Ivy Park, and Drake with OVO, hoodies and T-shirts that feature his signature Sheffield Wednesday-ish owl. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 and Drake aren\u2019t just musicians, they\u2019re cultural icons and this is a way for them to express that,\u201d says Myers. Ivy Park was sold at Topshop, JD Sports and Net-a-Porter. Talking to the latter, I find that the fact Beyonc\u00e9 is a multimillion dollar artist is almost a side point. \u201cIvy Park is an athleisure brand for women ... where fashion meets function and performance and style are equally valued,\u201d says retail fashion director Lisa Aitken. She adds, however, that it\u2019s the leotard with \u201cIvy Park\u201d in huge letters \u2013 basically, merch by another name \u2013 sold out in half a day.

See Kate Moss expressing her sadness at Bowie\u2019s death in January by wearing T-shirt with his face on, or anyone wearing a Prince T-shirt last month. But it\u2019s now gone beyond this simple idea to a look in its own right. Vetements has played on this idea with logos that look like a long lost heavy metal band, although if you look closely you see they one read \u201cVetements\u201d while another read \u201cJustin4ever\u201d. Which Justin \u2013 Bieber? Timberlake? Trudeau? \u2013 isn\u2019t really the point. Zara Mirkin set up Merch Junkies, which repurposes vintage clothes adding the names of Bowie, Lemmy and Alice Cooper. She says she thinks people buying merch don\u2019t have to have the back catalogue. \u201cMost people know Bowie as a style icon, not necessarily his music,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople think these musicians are fabulous looking and want to dress like them.\u201d Mirkin herself has a more old-school attitude. \u201cI wear band T-shirts because if I\u2019m out wearing one and it\u2019s someone\u2019s favourite band, then it starts a conversation,\u201d she says. That\u2019s arguably the case whatever the reason you\u2019re wearing these clothes. With the merch look in fashion as well as music, it\u2019s the content of the conversation \u2013 from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s marital issues to the best Bowie lightening stripes \u2013 that\u2019s the variable.",
