  "body": "A woman stabbed her two young daughters to death a day after fleeing to a women\u2019s refuge in fear of her partner, a court has heard. Samira Lupidi, 24, cried as jurors were told she admitted the manslaughter of Jasmine, 17 months, and Evelyn, three, but denies murder. Bradford crown court heard that Lupidi stabbed the two children in their beds with a 25cm kitchen knife before telling staff at the women\u2019s refuge: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have them, he can\u2019t have them either.\u201d The court heard that Lupidi, who moved to Bradford four years ago, told police officers the day before the killings that she had been physically assaulted by her \u201cfinancially and psychologically controlling\u201d partner, Carl Weaver. She told officers who visited her home address in Heckmondwike, near Bradford, on 16 November last year that she had been hit on her arm and her legs by her partner, the father of the two children. She told the police that Weaver gave her limited money for clothes and food, the court heard, and she feared he would try to take their children away from her after they were baptised the following weekend. The officers noted that she did not appear to have injuries following the alleged assaults but took her and her daughters to a women\u2019s refuge for her own safety, jurors were told.

They were reassured that they were safe and spent the night there. The following morning, the court heard, a support worker knocked on her bedroom door and Lupidi rushed out with her hands \u201csmeared with blood\u201d. Peter Moulson QC, prosecuting, told jurors that Lupidi was heard to say, \u201cThey won\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve killed them,\u201d as she ran out of the flat shouting on her mobile phone. She is then alleged to have said: \u201cI killed them. I hurt them. I killed the children.\u201d The children were rushed to Bradford Royal infirmary but both were pronounced dead soon after their arrival. Each girl had suffered nine separate stab wounds to the heart and lungs, the court heard. A 25cm kitchen knife was found on Lupidi\u2019s bed. In the moments after the girls were found, Lupidi was asked when it had happened. The court heard she responded: \u201cJust now.\u201d She then allegedly said: \u201cIt\u2019s his fault \u2013 now he has a reason to kill me. If I can\u2019t have them, he can\u2019t have them either.\u201d The court was told she added that she feared Weaver was coming to get her, and said: \u201cI had to do this.\u201d The judge, Mr Justice Eady, had to stop proceedings as Lupidi cried in the dock as the details of the killings were read out.  Flanked by a translator and a dock officer, Lupidi, wearing a grey cardigan and a white shirt, held her head in her hands and wept before taking a short break. Moulson told the jury that after Lupidi was arrested and taken to the police station, she told the custody officer: \u201cI know what I have done. My life is nothing now.\u201d In statements read to the court, workers at the refuge described how Lupidi was highly agitated and weeping as she confessed to the killings. Jacoba Laan, the manager of the refuge, said the 14in knife with a 10in blade appeared to have been taken from the kitchen of the premises. Laan said that Lupidi, referring to Weaver, told her: \u201cHe always said I was a bad mother and now he can say it. Now him and his family can be sure I killed my babies so I am a bad mum.\u201d Shamaila Kosar, a domestic violence worker at the refuge, said in a statement read to court that she had seen Lupidi carrying her youngest daughter shortly before the killing. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t comprehend how she had done what she had done in such a short space of time,\u201d she said. Her colleague, Farzana Kauser, described how Lupidi repeated \u201cI killed the children\u201d as she paced around in tears when her daughters were discovered with fatal stab wounds. The Italian also told the workers she had wanted to kill herself \u2013 a comment she later repeated when arrested a placed under caution. \u201cShe said she had tried to stab herself and indicated a stabbing motion towards her stomach but said she could not do it. She did not elaborate,\u201d said Kauser in a statement. She declined to comment in two separate police interviews on the following day, the court heard. Moulson told jurors that Lupidi admitted the manslaughter of her daughters on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denied murder. The trial continues.",
