  "body": "How many seats in a coffee shop does it take to necessitate provision of a customer loo? Fifteen? Five? A solitary stool and a sticky counter? An existential question and one that, according to this toilet-user, depends on a complex set of circumstances, from what\u2019s on the menu to where the chairs are positioned. (Five outside? Toilet unlikely. Four inside? Expect a small, whiffy loo with no paper towels in the dispenser.) The correct answer, according to section 20 of the 1976 Local Government MIscellaneous Provisions Act, is that toilets should be provided if food and drink is being sold for consumption on the premises. Which is presumably why you can\u2019t scoff a sausage roll in Greggs and then demand use of the washroom but you can order a takeout coffee in a central London Starbucks and get a key to the saddest toilets in Soho. (When it comes to public conveniences don\u2019t be fooled by the romance of a key.) Many more takeaways could now be forced to install a toilet following a high court ruling that a 10-seat threshold set in regulatory guidance was not a correct interpretation of the law, and that local authorities had the power to require premises with fewer seats to install toilets. Two branches of Greggs, both of which had fewer than 10 seats, lost a legal battle with Hull council after a judge ruled that for the council not to have that power might provide a unfair commercial advantage to firms such as Greggs, which provided seating even though the main part of their trade was take-away, over other firms which served food and drink on their premises. If the ruling, which is being appealed, sets a precedent, as many as 21,500 takeaways and 5,230 coffee shops across the UK \u2013 the vast majority of which are small independent businesses \u2013 could be affected.   Related: UK public toilets mapped: where's your nearest?    \u201cIt would be a major problem,\u201d Raymond Martin, director of the British Toilet Association, says. \u201cMost of these are not going to be able to provide a toilet. Many would be forced to close down.\u201d Would he expect a loo in a takeaway with only a few tables? \u201cIt does seem right to provide a toilet if a takeaway allows me to consume food and stay on the premises for a period of time,\u201d he replies diplomatically. \u201cBut should we force takeaways to put in toilets? I don\u2019t think we can.\u201d The real issue, he adds, is the loss of public toilets from our cities and town centres. The law currently does not compel local authorities to provide public toilets \u2013 of which there are around 4,000 in the UK \u2013 and the result is that Britain has lost more than 40% of its facilities in the past decade. \u201cWe reckon we are losing toilets faster than we\u2019re gaining them,\u201d Martin says. \u201cEvery day we get calls from councillors saying: \u2018We\u2019re thinking of closing some, if not all, of our toilets. What\u2019s our legal position?\u2019 In years gone by, people would have got their food from a takeaway and then used a public toilet later. That is no longer the case.\u201d   Related: No toilets, self-service machines and noise: shopping is hell for us older people    Meanwhile stores, supermarkets, petrol stations and other commercial providers have stepped in, hopeful that, after we\u2019ve relieved ourselves in their lovely free toilets, conveniently located right at the back of the store so we have to walk past all their goods to get to them, we\u2019ll do a spot of shopping. Perhaps toilets are the latest trick in retail, the new piped muzak luring us in to spend a penny before we spend, spend, spend. \u201cThe government wants people out shopping, eating, keeping the economy flowing,\u201d Martin notes. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t want to provide the toilets.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2016 to correct details about the judgment and the requirements set out in the 1976 Local Government Miscellaneous Provisions Act.",
