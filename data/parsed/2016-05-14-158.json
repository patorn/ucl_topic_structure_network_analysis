That is, until you arrive and take stock of east Asia\u2019s reality, a tangled web of unresolved historical disputes and rising tensions. It makes Europe\u2019s accomplishments over the past six decades seem dazzling. \u201cLet us learn from the mistakes of the past,\u201d reads a sign at Hiroshima\u2019s memorial to the 140,000 victims of the A-bomb. In a park tourists stroll past the gutted dome of the only building at the centre of the atomic blast of 6 August 1945 that was left standing. A museum displays waxworks of the living dead who struggled from the rubble, their clothes torn, their bodies scorched. There are few places where the devastation wreaked by the 20th century comes across as powerfully as in Hiroshima \u2013 which Barack Obama will visit later this month \u2013 and it is this that explains why Japanese people see themselves as victims, not perpetrators, of second world war atrocities.   Related: How China's artificial islands led to tension in the South China Sea    Asia may be thriving, but it is haunted by the ghosts of its past \u2013 nationalist passions are high. China has all but spread panic among its neighbours by pushing its territorial claims and by building artificial islands in the South China Sea to extend its military reach. The Chinese leadership refers to ancient imperial history to legitimise its actions, but that only exacerbates the fears of countries from the Philippines to Vietnam, which say their interests are being encroached upon. \u201cThe Chinese keep repeating they were humiliated for 200 years \u2013 does that mean we should accept anything they do?\u201d a Japanese defence analyst asked me. In Tokyo, I visited the Yasukuni shrine and its controversial museum, where Japan\u2019s war dead \u2013 including war criminals \u2013 are honoured. The site is dedicated to \u201cthe souls of the defenders of the homeland\u201d. Later, I attended a conference on tensions between China and Japan over the disputed Senkaku Islands. The general assessment was grim. \u201cFor the first time since the end of the second world war,\u201d said one speaker, \u201cmilitary power is being integrated into statecraft\u201d \u2013 that was meant as a description of China. Tensions are mounting in the region and they include a worrying amount of nuclear sabre-rattling. In January North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test, and this month it announced it had launched a ballistic missile from a submarine (although South Korea declared that it had failed). Kim Jong-un is pursuing a strategy of military expansion, driven by an obsession with the regime\u2019s political survival and the legacy of the 1950s Korean war. A regional arms race is well under way \u2013 led by China. In 2014 defence spending in the Asia-Pacific region ($338bn) surpassed that of Europe. Everyone has their eyes set on a confrontation between China and the US. One American defence expert in Tokyo estimates there is a \u201c50-50\u201d chance of a US-China military clash \u201cin the next five to 10 years\u201d. This may all seem distant and irrelevant to Europeans. But if anything, east Asia\u2019s mounting tensions should serve as a reminder of how valuable the European construct is. Europe built its unity on the notion of overcoming old hatreds and antagonisms. Asia has done none of that \u2013 nor does it seem likely to any time soon. The region lives in the shadows of the second world war and the Korean war, and the legacy of the cold war still looms large. Asia has no unity, nor has it sought genuine reconciliation (even if Japan and South Korea have made efforts to set aside their dispute over the issue of \u201ccomfort women\u201d).  Europe has a shared cultural background and a geographical cohesion that Asia lacks. Robert Dujarric, a professor at Tokyo\u2019s Temple University, points out that there is no word in Japanese or Chinese for \u201cAsian\u201d: the phonetic expression \u201cAsia\u201d was taken from Europeans. It was colonial Europe that told Asians they were Asians. In 2011 Obama announced that the US was \u201cturning its attention to the vast potential of the Asia-Pacific region\u201d. It seemed to acknowledge the ascendancy of Asia and that Europe was on the decline. But five years on all of America\u2019s allies, from Europe to Asia, are worried about the solidity of US commitments to their security. They want reassurances \u2013 to know that there is a deterrent for their adversaries. Just as Europe has been shaken by Russian military action in Ukraine, China is forcing a strategic reshuffle of the Asia-Pacific region. America\u2019s increased isolationism is watched with concern. There is a growing debate about how Japan might start to play a more active role in countering China, and speculation that Tokyo might pursue nuclear ambitions \u2013 hardly a reassuring prospect. Japan still has a long way to go before it can entertain regional ambitions without reigniting fears of its past. The family history of Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offers a telling example. Some experts say it goes a long way to explaining his brand of nationalism. Abe\u2019s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was an official in the puppet state of Manchukuo set up by Japan in north-eastern China in the 1930s. After the war Kishi was imprisoned in Tokyo, accused of enslaving thousands of Chinese people. But he was released, on the grounds of insufficient evidence. This had more to do with political expediency than with justice, according to the American historian John Dower. The cold war had started and the US was focused on fighting communism rather than prosecuting Japanese war criminals. In the 1950s Kishi went on to become prime minister. Imagine transposing that to Europe and postwar Germany, and the contrast between these two parts of the world is startling.  Asia\u2019s tensions have their roots not just in rivalries between countries but in a battle over memory. The traumas of the 20th century were never overcome in this region. They were in Europe. In east Asia, the past has never been properly acknowledged. It has been in Europe. Twentieth-century wars still resonate, and poison diplomacy and internal politics. But in Europe the lessons of history have been spelled out and learned. That\u2019s something Europeans should treasure.  \u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2016. An earlier version said the Hiroshima peace memorial was the only building left standing by the atomic bomb. It was the only building at the centre of the explosion to survive.",
