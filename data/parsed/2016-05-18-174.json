  "body": "The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has hired the Norwegian FA official Kjetil Siem as his new director of strategy to oversee reform \u2013 two years after Siem hailed Sepp Blatter as \u201ca role model\u201d. Fifa said Siem had taken up a newly created position in its reformed structure, and would begin work before the arrival in June of the governing body\u2019s recently appointed secretary general, Fatma Samoura, a UN official from Senegal who has never before worked in football. For the past four years, Siem, who had a spell running the Premier Soccer League in South Africa, was secretary general of Norway\u2019s FA while Infantino held the same position at Uefa. He is credited in Norway with creating the \u201cHandshake for Peace\u201d project with the Nobel Peace Centre, which was later adopted by Blatter.     Kjetil Siem, former head of South Africa\u2019s Premier Soccer League, announcing a partnership with the Bundesliga in 2010.    Speaking to Dagbladet in January 2014, Siem said: \u201cI\u2019m sure no Norwegian has more respect than I do for the Fifa president Sepp Blatter. He is actually a role model.\u201d After Blatter was forced to resign amid the continuing corruption scandal, Siem stood by his praise for a man who had \u201cheld the football family together\u201d, saying Blatter deserved respect for \u201cwhat he has done for the development of football in the third world. He has made Fifa into a cohesive organisation.\u201d Siem leaves Norway\u2019s FA after a difficult few months, having recently given in to pressure to make public what officials claimed in expenses. Siem said he had only resisted previous demands for transparency to avoid revealing where he had travelled, risking damaging commercial negotiations. \u201cFor me personally there\u2019s now an advantage to showing my receipts,\u201d Siem said. \u201cThey will show that there\u2019s a very good reason for them. Norwegian football has become very international.\u201d Asked if he would disclose his new salary at Fifa, Siem said: \u201cAfter what I\u2019ve been through, I will not say anything about it. I put together all my expenses and said yes to everything, but for two months I was hung on the gallows.\u201d He said he was \u201cvery proud and surprised, in a good way\u201d, to be appointed and said that the organisation\u2019s current troubles made it the ideal time to join. \u201cI\u2019ll work on reforms, then on streamlining Fifa \u2026 It\u2019s a privilege. It could not be better timing.\u201d Infantino told the Norwegian FA\u2019s website: \u201cI am very happy to have Kjetil Siem aboard. He has international experience and has shown the kind of qualities I need around me in efforts to reform Fifa.\u201d The appointment comes days after Domenico Scala, the head of Fifa\u2019s audit and compliance committee, resigned over fears new rules would compromise independence and impede investigations into corruption.",
