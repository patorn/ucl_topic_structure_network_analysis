I had my third child in Paris in 1984, and ended up on a small beach with on L\u2019Isle-Saint-Denis, sunbathing and topless. I\u00a0was initially shy; but the other women\u2019s display encouraged me.

Everyone makes mistakes, but few have the courage to take the flak. All politicians, bankers and CEOs, please take note.Maggie EvansLiverpool \u2022 If the BBC did remove recipes from its website (Report, 18 May), they would continue to exist at the Internet Archive.
