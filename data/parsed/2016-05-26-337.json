Speaking at a Sorry Day event in Darwin on Thursday, Peris said she walked into federal parliament three years ago as its first elected Aboriginal woman and was leaving now on her own terms to take care of her children.  She announced her resignation earlier this week after it emerged she was in talks with the AFL about taking its top Indigenous role.  \u201cUntil you are an Aboriginal person, do not criticise me for the decisions I have made,\u201d Peris told media in Darwin.   Related: Nova Peris resigns from the Senate after reports she was seeking AFL job    With the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, at her side, Peris said she wanted to acknowledge the work of the Labor party \u201cin trying to elevate and empower the lives of Aboriginal people\u201d.  Shorten said Peris was a \u201cremarkable Australian\u201d and the Labor party had been fortunate to have her \u201cenergy and commitment\u201d in the Senate. And her decision to focus on family reflected that she was \u201ca great mum as well\u201d. Asked why she hadn\u2019t announced she would be stepping down earlier, rather than during the election campaign, Peris said: \u201cI didn\u2019t call the election.\u201d Guardian Australia understands Peris\u2019s lack of contact with colleagues after the AFL story broke had angered them.           Nova Peris \u2018a trailblazer\u2019 in Senate, says Bill Shorten    The dual Olympian won the Senate seat after the then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, made a \u201ccaptain\u2019s pick\u201d and replaced the incumbent Trish Crossin. This week Crossin has suggested she deserves an apology. Frontrunners for Peris\u2019s replacement as number one NT Senate ticket include the journalist and former NT minister Malarndirri McCarthy, who has said she was seeking the nomination, and Peris\u2019s chief-of-staff, Ursula Raymond, who has said she is thinking about it. It is believed the new candidate will be announced on Saturday. The Coalition senator for the NT, Nigel Scullion, said Peris had made history in entering parliament.  \u201cAs a senator for 15 years I know how tough those first years in parliament can be and respect her decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish her well for the future.\u201d  With Shorten beside her Peris said:   Thank you, Bill. I want to acknowledge that we meet here on this land, I\u2019m a Darwin girl, born on this country. Three years ago, I walked into parliament as a first Aboriginal woman and until you are an Aboriginal person do not criticise me for the decisions I have made. This isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s hard. And today I\u2019m here with my mum, Joan, my aunty Jenita, who are also members of the stolen generations, and we\u2019ve come here today to honour their resilience. It also is a day that 18 years ago that the Bringing Them Home report was tabled in federal parliament. And we still have a long way to go. A long, long way to go.  And I want to acknowledge the work of the Australian Labor party for the work that they have done in trying to elevate and empower the lives of Aboriginal people. But that [work] will not stop until Aboriginal people are treated as equals in this country. I may be leaving but I am leaving on my terms and I want to make this clear \u2013 no one should judge me. I am an inherited Aboriginal women with strengths and resilience that I have had to endure for 45 years. And it\u2019s not easy to wake up every morning and bounce out of bed and pretend that life is fantastic. Because it isn\u2019t. Aboriginal people have no inherited wealth. They have inherited pain. But we have a vision and I know that Bill Shorten and Uncle Pat Dodson who we are descendants of the Yarru people, people like your Warren Snowdon who is my old history teacher and a good friend and mentor. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Bill, Warren and Uncle Pat \u2013 and the door that\u2019s now been opened by me exiting \u2013 I wish that person well and I know that their time in parliament they will make a significant difference. It can only be done with the Australian Labor party because the vision of the Australian Labor party is a vision of Australia\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. So I am not going to make any further comment apart from this decision that I\u2019ve made has been on family \u2013 and I have to look after my children.\u201d",
