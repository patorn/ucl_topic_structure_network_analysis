Trinity Mirror, the publisher of national titles including the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, officially announced the closure of New Day after just nine weeks hours before investors gathered at the company\u2019s annual general meeting. Representatives of the National Union of Journalists gathered outside the venue, in London\u2019s Canary Wharf near Trinity Mirror\u2019s headquarters, with placards saying \u201cNew Day, New Cuts!\u201d. Inside the meeting, NUJ official Chris Morley, a shareholder speaking as a proxy for Trinity Mirror staff, quizzed the board about the total costs of the New Day project and whether \u201csacrifices\u201d would have to be made across the publisher\u2019s UK operation as a result. \u201c[NUJ] members have asked us to raise this today because they feel this reflects on the whole group,\u201d he said. \u201cAny loss of a print title does tend to have that effect, very demoralising. They feel it it was set up as a speculative venture and are concerned about the costs arisen from start up and destruction. They worry that sacrifices will be made around the country in Trinity Mirror centres to pay for this venture.\u201d He accused Trinity Mirror chairman David Grigson, who fielded the question in the first instance, of being \u201csecretive\u201d when he said the company does not give a breakdown of costs, profits and losses to any individual title. \u201cNobody is more disappointed about New Day than this group of people here [the board],\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve thought about this very hard. It was not speculative. It was built on phenomenal research and hard thinking but we knew there were risks. But we are innovative publishers, that is our job. I don\u2019t agree with that notion that we are keeping anything secret. We are comfortable we can more than make up the costs. The numbers are pretty low. You don\u2019t have anything to be concerned about. I reject we are being secretive, we are being commercially sensible.\u201d The only publicly stated cost is \u00a35m for a TV-led ad campaign to promote the New Day\u2019s launch.  Simon Fox, Trinity Mirror\u2019s chief executive, said that there would not be cuts made around the business, including newly-acquired regional business Local World, specifically in relation to New Day losses. \u201cThere is no decision [on cuts], not one, made as a consequence of the New Day,\u201d he said.  Trinity Mirror has said that it will make \u00a315m in cost savings in 2016. Morley pressed on what would happen to the 25 staff employed by the New Day.  Fox said that staff seconded from the Mirror would return to their roles but for others, on short-term contracts signed up \u201cwith their eyes open\u201d to the risk, it may not work out. \u201cWe will inevitably have to say goodbye to some of those people,\u201d he said. \u201cI am desperately sorry we can\u2019t go on to offer them full-time roles. That is the situation.\u201d \u201cGetting lapsed readers to return to the market was harder than anticipated,\u201d said Fox. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of failure if it means we continue to innovate and experiment. While it is disappointing we will make sure the many learnings we have had over the past eight weeks are fully incorporated across the business. We apply tight financial discipline to such ideas to ensure the downside risk is low and the upside opportunity is high.\u201d Alison Phillips, the editor of the New Day, is understood to be lined up for a senior editorial role at Trinity Mirror. Phillips had previously been responsible for editing the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, but moved to the New Day project last September. She is understood not to be returning to editing the weekend titles, but her new role is unclear. Trinity Mirror\u2019s share price rose over 6% on Friday, which some at the meeting took as a sign of relief from investors that the risky and loss-making New Day was now closed. In fact, city analysts were buoyed by a slight improvement in Trinity Mirror\u2019s figures for April, versus the first quarter of the year.  \u201cThe biggest issue [affecting share price] has been the negative newsflow around print advertising, and not just from us,\u201d said Fox. \u201cI believe that is what has driven the share price down. It is true the print market has been difficult. I believe the reasonfor the bounce back [in share price today] is because in April the trends were much better. Lets hope April is a sign of things to come.\u201d",
