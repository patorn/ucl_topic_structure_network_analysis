  "body": "In the first episode of new sitcom Mum (BBC2), Cathy is getting ready to bury her husband, Dave. Not as in dig the hole herself (this is a mistake her son Jason\u2019s new girlfriend Kelly makes); professional undertakers will do the actual work. But it\u2019s happening today.  Jason\u2019s wandering around the house in his pants. Kelly shows up, in a red dress and no pants, for the funeral, so she borrows some knickers from Cathy, even though they\u2019ve never met before. Kelly doesn\u2019t think before she speaks \u2013 doesn\u2019t think much at all \u2013 but she\u2019s nice, and means well.  Next to arrive is Cathy\u2019s brother Derek (\u201cHaven\u2019t you grown?\u201d he says, as he always does) with his partner, Pauline, who\u2019s a horrid, bitter snob. Then Dave\u2019s parents, who are old and deaf and a bit tired of life. And Michael, who was Dave\u2019s best man, and is now clearly in love with Cathy, though he\u2019s an old-school bloke and not very good with things like that (talking, emotions, etc) and anyway, it\u2019s probably a bit soon, what with Dave not yet in the ground. Finally, the professional undertakers arrive. One of them reckons he invented the phrase Keep Calm and Carry On.  Mum is written by Stefan Golaszewski, who wrote Him & Her. It\u2019s made by the same people. That\u2019s both a good thing and a less good thing. A good one because it shares the same subtlety and warmth; it\u2019s somehow familiar; the characters are believable, three-dimensional ones (lovely performances, too, especially from Lesley Manville as Cathy and Lisa McGrillis as Kelly). They don\u2019t speak in the old sitcom way, delivering one-liners then waiting for the laughter, but like real people speak. Oh, and there\u2019s the same odd interest in toilets. (What is it with you and loos, Stefan?) So what\u2019s the problem? Well, it\u2019s inevitably going to get compared to that last outing, one of the best TV comedies of recent times. And it doesn\u2019t quite compare \u2013 not so far, anyway. This is a bit more grownup, (more BBC2 than 3), but Him & Her was ruder, more visceral, sexier and \u2013 vital for a comedy \u2013 funnier.",
