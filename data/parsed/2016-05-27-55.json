  "body": "Related: Isabelle Huppert: Elle is not about a woman 'accepting her rapist'    Paul Verhoeven is not worried. If anything, he\u2019s jubilant. His new film Elle, the first full-length feature he\u2019s directed in 10 years, has just premiered at Cannes to feverish acclaim. It\u2019s being called one of his best and suddenly he\u2019s the Croisette comeback king. But the film itself is a problematic concoction: a staggeringly perverted black comedy about a woman\u2019s unconventional response to being raped that pulls in elements of sadomasochism, voyeurism, spousal violence and adultery \u2013 but smattered with genuine, riotous laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rape comedy at all,\u201d says Verhoeven. \u201cIt\u2019s rape and there is comedy. You\u2019re not laughing at all when she gets raped.\u201d Despite his strongly held beliefs on what the film is and isn\u2019t, there does seem to be a sense of relief from the 77-year-old Dutch film-maker, as he holds court on the roof of a swanky hotel near the beach. It\u2019s the day after the screening and what was initially seen as a lurid oddity has become the festival\u2019s most discussed and enthusiastically cheered film.            If Verhoeven is the toast of the town, it\u2019s not a position he\u2019s entirely comfortable with. This, after all, is the man who made 1995\u2019s Showgirls, a film that received endless column inches and seemed to cement his status as a trash auteur who had finally lost all connection with his audience and, perhaps, reality. A very different director sits here now, competing for the Palme d\u2019Or against the Dardenne brothers and Pedro Almod\u00f3var, whose films have received far less ecstatic reviews.   Related: Isabelle Huppert: \u2018I\u2019d love to work with Woody Allen or Noah Baumbach\u2019    \u201cI think I\u2019ll have to do something that makes people hate me again,\u201d says Verhoeven. \u201cTo my astonishment, there isn\u2019t much controversy yet. If they attack it, they would not attack style \u2013 they would attack the moral content. It\u2019s possible. If you want to look at it in a negative way, you can find moments to say, \u2018Well, wait a moment.\u2019\u201d And Elle is full of those moments. It\u2019s a film that walks a tightrope, provoking and challenging our preconceptions. Based on Oh \u2026 , the award-winning novel by Betty Blue writer Philippe Djian, it stars Isabelle Huppert as the icy CEO of a gaming company who is raped in her home by a masked assailant. But rather than rush to the police, she calmly cleans up, takes a blood-tinged bath and goes on with her busy life. When her attacker starts to threaten a reprise, she becomes entangled in a strange and twisted game. To tell you just how strange things get would be to spoil the film\u2019s many pleasures. It fails, at almost every point, to conform to what we expect from the narrative of a woman who has been sexually assaulted. \u201cWe thought it would be an American movie,\u201d says Verhoeven. \u201cWe basically translated the novel into English and I knew a very good American scriptwriter. We were basically replacing Paris with Chicago or Seattle. It was only when we got the reaction of female American stars that we started to realise this kind of story without a revenge was not for the American market.\u201d The female stars Verhoeven spoke to (\u201call A-list\u201d) turned him down. \u201cOne said she felt uncomfortable because of things that had happened to her in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cOne didn\u2019t give any reasons but just said, \u2018Certainly not.\u2019 Usually, you give it to the agents, you wait a few weeks. This was immediate or within 48 hours. An absolute no.\u201d   Related: Elle review: Paul Verhoeven's brazen rape revenge comedy is a dangerous delight    The only American actor who would have been game, he thinks, is Jennifer Jason Leigh. \u201cShe would have had absolutely no problem,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s extremely audacious. But she\u2019s an artistic presence and we were looking for names.\u201d But will he tell us who said no? \u201cOf course not.\u201d The rejection also frustrates Verhoeven for reasons that are not immediately obvious. \u201cI agree that there are not many female parts \u2013 certainly not in American cinema. It\u2019s weird that when there is one, they lacked the audacity to be controversial. I hope all these actresses see the movie.\u201d Going to France and teaming up with Huppert, who navigated similar territory in Michael Haneke\u2019s psychosexual drama The Piano Teacher, meant that the story could make its way to the screen unscathed, and the lead could remain fascinatingly enigmatic. \u201cShe\u2019s tough but she\u2019s just in charge,\u201d says Verhoeven. \u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s a strong woman, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d Making his first film in French meant relearning the language and moving far out of his comfort zone. The stress, though, led to severe headaches. \u201cI went to doctors and they went inside with cameras to check if there was a tumour,\u201d he says. \u201cI only understood what was happening when I started shooting the movie and the headaches disappeared. It was fear.\u201d     \u2018She knows what she\u2019s doing\u2019 \u2026 Isabelle Huppert in Elle.    Elle is also a frustrating reminder of just what we\u2019ve been missing for the past 10 years, since Verhoeven\u2019s wildly entertaining second world war melodrama Black Book, which itself was six years after his more conventional horror, Hollow Man. His career is curious \u2013 a \u201cstrange trip\u201d he calls it \u2013 moving from the Netherlands (where he made nightmarish Hitchcockian thriller The Fourth Man and erotic drama Turkish Delight) to the US (Basic Instinct, Total Recall and RoboCop). He still sees himself as an American director, even though it was in that role that he endured his most painful career low: Showgirls. The explicit drama about a stripper in Vegas was a failure of epic, history-book proportions, and Verhoeven thinks its effect can still be felt, especially when it comes to casting women. \u201cThere might be some echoes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made my life a bit miserable. I thought I made a very interesting movie \u2013 so you can be very wrong about these things. After Showgirls, making movies became more and more difficult.\u201d He\u2019s keen to continue working outside the US (\u201cIt\u2019s not just commercial, it\u2019s artistic\u201d) and to leave science-fiction behind, which will be bad news for children of the 80s. At the press conference the day before, he criticised Hollywood\u2019s reliance on superheroes, saying cinema needed \u201cmore normality\u201d. Whether Elle represents this is questionable. Huppert herself has referred to it as a \u201cfairytale\u201d.     Verhoeven\u2019s most painful career low \u2026 Showgirls, starring Elizabeth Berkley. Photograph: Allstar/United Artists    While he\u2019s proud to leave gaps in the story for the viewer to fill in, his own take on the material is often surprising in itself. He says that \u201cultimately\u201d there is a connection between our antiheroine\u2019s rape and her ability to orgasm, while he calls her decision to leave her husband after a single violent incident \u201cextreme\u201d. Although Elle has been lauded as daring and thrilling, one can sense a storm gathering. In 1992, there were protests over Basic Instinct\u2019s treatment of lesbian characters and the explicit content of Showgirls saw many label Verhoeven a misogynist. But he insists his stance on women has been misunderstood. \u201cI\u2019m pro-women,\u201d he says. \u201cI like women very much and, basically, I like strong women. I\u2019ve been accused of being a feminist.\u201d \u2022 Elle will be released later this year.",
