  "body": "The whistle blew but it was not over yet. Exhausted players lay on the San Siro turf, socks pulled down their calves and cramp climbing up, Gareth Bale speaking for most in admitting he could hardly feel his legs. More than 120 minutes played, a handful left: the 2016 European Cup final was heading to penalties, all or nothing from 12 yards, one last effort required, mentally and physically. Bale gets a massage, Diego Simeone and Zinedine Zidane talk to their players. A coin is tossed, a decision made: Atl\u00e9tico choose to take the second penalty, which pleases the Real players who know statistics suggest that suits them. So they go first; they also chose an end, their end. Cristiano Ronaldo sits a little apart, on a plastic drinks trolley, thinking. He has \u201ca feeling\u201d. He pulls his manager aside and tells him: \u201cGive me the fifth.\u201d He knows what awaits. One of the staff helps him to his feet; it is time. \u201cI saw Zidane before the penalties and told him to put me as the last taker because I feel I am going to score the winning goal,\u201d Ronaldo says afterwards. \u201cAnd that is what happened.\u201d So much happened, an epic night starting with an opening goal from Sergio Ramos, the defender who says he has a \u201cstriker\u2019s soul\u201d \u2013 hero in Lisbon and hero here, too. The clock showed 92.48 when he headed the goal in 2014; two years on it says 15.27, but that does not mean San Siro will lack the drama of Est\u00e1dio da Luz. There was Bale tearing into Atl\u00e9tico; Gabi Fern\u00e1ndez and Carlos Casemiro everywhere, impeccable; Yannick Carrasco\u2019s equaliser and his celebration, sprinting to the touchline and planting a kiss on his girlfriend\u2019s lips; there was his dash in the last minute too, cut down by Ramos. There was Antoine Griezmann\u2019s penalty thumping back off the bar and, at the end of it all, Juanfran Torres\u2019s penalty coming back off the post. In Lisbon Juanfran, relentlessly positive, provider of the equaliser, a footballer reinvented under Simeone, had promised Atl\u00e9tico would be back. He had also scored the decisive penalty against PSV Eindhoven. Now there\u2019s a lost look. All of which leaves only Ronaldo. \u201cMy performance may not have been my best one but who played unbelievable tonight? No one,\u201d he says. He admits that he is \u201cvery tired\u201d and his influence during 120 minutes has been limited but he is the competition\u2019s top scorer for the fourth year in a row and he\u2019s had a \u201cvision\u201d; his moment awaits. There are many images from this final but the last one, perhaps the lasting one too, is Ronaldo. Fernando Torres is due to take Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s fifth but it never gets to him. Ronaldo is there. Moscow, where he missed in the shootout, is not on his mind. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI was confident.\u201d Like Lucas V\u00e1zquez, Marcelo, Bale and Ramos, Ronaldo hits his penalty to Jan Oblak\u2019s left; and like them, he scores. Ronaldo whips his shirt off and team-mates pile on. Real are European champions for the 11th time, Atl\u00e9tico have been defeated for a third time; 1974, 2014, and 2016, each final more cruel than the last. So cruel that Simeone, in black and broken, says it is a failure, insisting: \u201cNo one remembers who came second.\u201d He is wrong, but he drops his first hints that maybe his journey has come to an end. The message is different to Lisbon, when he vowed to return to the final. \u201cIt is time to think and reflect,\u201d he says, sadly. The man who is never beaten appears beaten. As he talks, long since having left the pitch, Real are still out there celebrating. \u201cI am so proud,\u201d Ronaldo says. The last time Bale left San Siro, he was carrying the match ball having scored a hat-trick against Internazionale. He took the ball from the 2014 final too, spiriting it away under his shirt. He has not got the ball from the 2016 final, even though that had been his intention. \u201cI was too tired,\u201d he says. But he is wearing a medal round his neck from a game in which he was outstanding. It is his second Champions League success since coming to Spain. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Bale is asked. \u201cVery cramped up,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cIt was a difficult night but an amazing night in the end.\u201d In the stands are Alba Violet, three, and Nava Valentina, two months. \u201cMy oldest daughter was there last time and my new daughter was here tonight: a night I will always remember,\u201d he says. \u201cI came to the biggest club in the world to win Champions Leagues but to win it is very difficult and to do it twice in three years is an amazing feat.\u201d By the end, his muscles are knotting but he takes a penalty anyway. \u201cHonestly, I thought I was going to be nervous but I wasn\u2019t nervous at all. When I got back to the halfway line afterwards, that was when I was, like, \u2018Oh my God\u2019. I was just hoping they would miss and then we would score but stepping up to take the penalty I felt nothing; it was very strange.\u201d \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa said afterwards: \u201cThere are players in the dressing room who are dead, who can barely walk.\u201d It has been hard, they have suffered, but they have survived. Ronaldo says: \u201cI am so proud. Every time is special. I remember the first [European Cup] win with Manchester United and two years ago against Atl\u00e9tico. To be top scorer again makes me feel proud.\u201d Ramos, who goes to Juanfran at the end, says: \u201cThis is written in history.\u201d Luka Modric seeks out Gabi. Real give Atl\u00e9tico a guard of honour, but there is no consolation. Torres called this the game of his life; now he stands in silence, eyes lost in his tears, seemingly reluctant to leave the field as if doing so would make this all real somehow, or like paralysis has taken him. Juanfran is on his knees in front of the fans and Koke later apologises to them as if this team has anything for which to say sorry. They have changed Atl\u00e9tico, winning the league and the cup, challenging the big two, but Simeone says that ultimately he could not defeat history, at least not in Europe. \u201cNone of us could,\u201d Koke says. \u201cWe do not deserve for this to happen to us twice,\u201d says Savic. \u201cIt was hard enough once.\u201d   Related: Time to introduce the Pepe Rule after his Champions League final antics | Sean Ingle    When Juanfran leaves the stadium, he does so without a word, a broken look on his face and that of his young son walking alongside him, hands over his ears. \u201cThe team is destroyed, but I am convinced we will be back,\u201d Gabi says. Savic insists: \u201cWe will fight until we win the Champions League and change history: this group of players has shown that it can lift itself.\u201d It will be harder this time, and it is Real Madrid who have made history in Milan. Their bus pulls out just before 3am, the trophy at the front, heading for the airport. \u201cWe\u2019re off to Cibeles to celebrate; it\u2019s a special night,\u201d Ronaldo says. It is light by the time the Real players get there, morning now, but the fans are waiting for them.",
