  "body": "Bastian Schweinsteiger has been included in Germany\u2019s provisional 27-man squad for Euro 2016 despite having not played for Manchester United since March with a knee injury.   Related: Diego Costa and Juan Mata left out of Spain\u2019s provisional Euro 2016 squad    The Germany captain suffered a partial tear of the medial collateral ligament in his right knee in the buildup to the world champions\u2019 3-2 friendly defeat by England but has been selected in Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s squad. Liverpool\u2019s Emre Can is also included, as is Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil and the former Gunners forward Lukas Podolski along with the uncapped trio Joshua Kimmich, Julian Brandt and Julian Weigl. Mario Gomez, who has just won the Turkish Super Lig with Besiktas, is one of few centre-forwards named by L\u00f6w but Germany boast a wealth of attacking talent in Real Madrid\u2019s Toni Kroos, the Bayern Munich duo Thomas M\u00fcller and Mario G\u00f6tze, Leroy San\u00e9 of Schalke and Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Marco Reus, who missed the 2014 World Cup with an ankle injury. If Podolski, 30, is picked he would be appearing at his seventh successive tournament, having already amassed 127 caps for Germany.
