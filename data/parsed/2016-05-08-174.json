  "body": "The school where Dane Hurst, star of Rambert dance company, learned to dance was eaten by termites and burned down by children. Thirteen years after he left South Africa, he has returned to the junction of Gelvandale and Helenvale in Port Elizabeth to show me where it was. A childcare centre stands there now, locked behind breezeblocks and barbed wire. There\u2019s a TB clinic, an armoured post office, a liquor store and scrubby grass. A man emerges from an outbuilding and Dane introduces himself, tells him he\u2019s a dancer in the UK, but that he grew up here. The man, Justin, tells him about the gangs who roam these streets. He counts on his fingers: there are 18 gangs in the 1.5km from the old bus terminus to the house Dane grew up in. They\u2019ve had 50 gun deaths in the past three months \u2013 the latest a two-year old girl caught in crossfire. To my surprise Dane says that his uncle was recently killed just here while washing his car. \u201cOh man,\u201d smiles Justin. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing \u2013 small world.\u201d Neither man reveals any other feelings.    What does a\u00a0child do in all this volatility? Well Dane, he danced    Dane is as alert as a cat to sudden noises though: metal being sheared in a makeshift workshop, a car roaring by, whistles from a corner manned by drug dealers. What does a child do in all this volatility? Well Dane, he danced. He tells Justin he wants to share this with other young people who want to escape the streets. \u201cI\u2019ve recently bought a dance floor over in London and right now as we speak it\u2019s on a ship being sent back here.\u201d This floor is not just any floor: this is the former rehearsal floor of Rambert, sold when the dance company moved from Chiswick to its new home on London\u2019s South Bank. All the roles that Dane has danced for Rambert, he learned on this floor. Mark Baldwin, Rambert\u2019s artistic director, compares it to his desk blotter: \u201cYou can probably see all the tracings of the work that we\u2019ve done for the last 15 years,\u201d he says. To Dane, it\u2019s a foundation. The reinforced vinyl will soften young South Africans\u2019 landings; it\u2019s a shock absorber, protecting joints, and it withstands friction and heat.     Coming home: Hurst back in South Africa, where he first discovered his love of dance. Photograph: Karl Schoemaker for the Observer    Dane won best male dancer at the Critics\u2019 Circle Awards in 2014, just after he bought the floor. At the ceremony he announced his dream to use dance to empower the young in his home city, and he asked for help. Now his plans have grown. He approached the architect Adam Kalkin to design a dance centre made out of shipping containers, for when there are funds to build it. The centre will house the floor. Port Elizabeth, as its name suggests, suits shipping containers. Dane looked out to sea as a child in Gelvandale. \u201cAll the houses are right on top of each other,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chaos in the street, but whenever you look out you see the ocean and somehow in your heart it makes you feel OK.\u201d    He saw a local boy crash through the termite-eaten floor and wanted to be that powerful    He chanced on ballet because his grandmother made costumes at the local dance school, the Toynbee Club. It was the time of apartheid. Gwen-Mary Wells, the ballet teacher, was white. She ignored segregation to teach in Gelvandale, which was designated a \u201ccoloured\u201d area. The Toynbee building swayed in the wind. People pelted it with stones. When pupils opened windows, the stone pelters stared at them through security wire. Yet for young Dane it was shelter. Sitting under Grandma Patty\u2019s sewing table, he watched another local boy \u2013 Warren \u2013 leaping out of sight. Once, Warren crashed through the termite-eaten floorboards and Dane wanted to be that powerful. Growing up, Dane was torn between several houses and parents who were both, at times, unemployed. House by house, Dane learned to contain himself. His mother, Maureen, lived north of the city in Booysen Park with Dane\u2019s three sisters, in a house only partly built when her marriage ended. Dane lived with his father\u2019s family in Gelvandale. His father fought his own demons. There was little food in anyone\u2019s cupboard, so dance was a release. Then Maureen took Dane to live with her and his sisters: a single mother with four children. They struggled for money. Dane felt guilty about his taxi fares back to Gelvandale for ballet class so he stopped, quickly losing the rigour and the freedom of living in the moment.     \u2018Dance is a sort of language that we use to make new friends\u2019: children in the township of Zwide, learning some dance moves with Hurst. Photograph: Karl Schoemaker for the Observer    Instead, he tried to connect with the local kids, but he became caught up in a crowd who burned tyres and was hauled in by police and put into a Casspir truck \u2013 one of the infamous symbols of apartheid oppression. He knew that he needed to do what Warren had done \u2013 to take flight. He went back to live at his father\u2019s so he could dance. One day he caught his mother watching him through a hole in the Toynbee Club wall, desperate for a sight of him. He ran after her. She fled. Dane focused. He won competitions. Gwen-Mary Wells guarded his winnings for him. His ambition was to escape abroad. SPRING 2015. Dane is in Kensington, west London, explaining to Lady Sainsbury his plan to take the floor back home , and to ask her for help. \u201cCan you show me the right direction?\u201d he asks. She has a photograph, dated April 1993, to show Dane. In it, she is dancing with Nelson Mandela at a private party in Johannesburg. She asks Dane what Mandela is doing with his fists.    In the dance studio what colour you are means nothing. When music plays there are no barriers    Dane explains that Mandela is doing a joyous Toyi-Toyi, a dance of African freedom. Decades earlier, Sainsbury had been a ballerina with Sadler\u2019s Wells ballet. Moments before the photograph was taken, she\u2019d had a discussion with Mandela where they agreed that, now that apartheid was ending, they could renew the flow of South African dancers to the UK. She would raise funds for exceptional students to train at the Rambert School. Warren Adams, the dancer who inspired Dane, won an early scholarship. Dane got one of the last. Adams is a Broadway choreographer now. When Dane tells Warren about his plans for the dance floor, Warren says: \u201cThat\u2019s modest!\u201d Dane tells Warren about a studio made out of shipping containers and Warren slows. \u201cWow, that\u2019s\u2026 ambitious,\u201d he says. \u201cI know it\u2019s crazy,\u201d says Dane. Warren: \u201cCrazy wins every time.\u201d Rambert has been Dane\u2019s family while he\u2019s been in Britain. At just 32, he is risking a lot to leave. He last danced with Rambert in Edinburgh last November. Until he\u2019d had this idea, being a dancer was his one wild dream: \u201cMost people say you must be crazy to leave a job. I feel like my heart is overpowering my mind. I\u2019ve grown up in the company, but like all relationships you have to step away from the household. Now\u2019s the time.\u201d     Far reaching: the workshops aim to give the children a way to survive that isn\u2019t violent. Photograph: Karl Schoemaker for the Observer    By the time we are standing on the corner where he learned to dance, it\u2019s April and the dance floor is on a ship called Presence, heading south. Dane has established an organisation called the Moving Assembly Project and launched a pilot project in Port Elizabeth: two weeks of workshops at the Ubuntu Health and Education Centre in the township of Zwide. Ubuntu was established to help children affected by HIV, but it is open to all. Outside is red-stone ground, scorched metal, corrugated roofs, litter. Shipping containers serve vetkoek burgers or advertise diamond and gold exchange. Inside, the children are encouraged to make a noise and support each other. Dane has invited Estela Merlos, another ex-Rambert dancer, to Africa to help him teach. The atmosphere is lively. Fifty children are learning a dance. One of them, Ayabonga Mayinje, fights the smile that comes over him with the music. Sesethu Budaza doesn\u2019t fight his; he\u2019s grinning. Lebogang Gobodo gracefully pushes air away. \u201cDance is some sort of language that we use to make new friends,\u201d says Amanda Coko, putting her actions into words.     Taking the stage: Hurst in Rambert\u2019s Transfigured Night by Kim Brandstrup last November. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    Most of the children speak Xhosa, some Sotho. Being mixed race, Dane resents that he was only allowed to learn \u201cthe colonial languages of Afrikaans and English\u201d, but says \u201cdance makes me feel part of the world. In a dance studio your language means nothing, what colour you are means nothing. When music plays there are no barriers.\u201d \u201cDancing is talking a lot of things,\u201d adds Gobisa Siwisa, another of the children. \u201cOne day I was washing dishes in the kitchen. Then I was making some moves and mother says, \u2018What you dancing, I don\u2019t believe it!\u2019\u201d A week ago, the students were themselves suspicious about the workshops. But who doesn\u2019t want to dance? In their lunch hour they cavort to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. Now they\u2019re feeling something more concentrated take shape. They dance duets, take each other\u2019s weight, gently, without embarrassment. A feisty girl who lip-reads dances sideways on, following the others. Dane stands like a prince. The success of the Ubuntu workshops augurs well for further workshops in the rural township of Grahamstown and in Durban, and for the entire future of Dane\u2019s dream. These children have really been lifted up. Gobisa believes: \u201cIf you are angry or sad or you\u2019re feeling emotional, when you dance those things go.\u201d This is Dane\u2019s aim: to give them a way to survive that isn\u2019t violent, because that\u2019s what saved him. By the time you read this, Dane\u2019s dance floor will have arrived in Port Elizabeth. The Sprung Floor, Dane Hurst\u2019s story, is being broadcast on 9 May on BBC Radio 4 and on 18 May on the World Service",
