Whatever the virtues of remaining in the EU, his idea in today\u2019s speech that \u201cwhenever we turn our backs on Europe, sooner or later we come to regret it\u201d is nonsense. As for Brexit \u201craising the risk of war\u201d, it is Project Fear gone mad. The best thing that happened to medieval England was its defeat in the hundred years war and the end of English ambitions on the continent of Europe. The best thing to happen in the 16th century was Henry VIII\u2019s rejection of the pan-European papacy. The wisest policy of his daughter, Elizabeth I, was an isolationism so rigid that she rejected one continental suitor after another. Britain fought off all attempts by France and Spain to restore European Catholicism, and accepted a Dutch and a German monarch strictly on the basis of British parliamentary sovereignty.    When Cameron cites recent wars in the Middle East, what did they have to do with Britain\u2019s EU membership?    Cameron\u2019s 18th-century predecessor was Robert Walpole, author of Walpole\u2019s Peace. Its meticulous isolation from Europe\u2019s conflicts brought Britain a golden age of enlightenment and industrial revolution. In 1734, Walpole could proudly tell the Queen: \u201cMadam there are 50,000 men slain this year in Europe, and not one an Englishman.\u201d Even William Pitt\u2019s creation of a British empire was based on staying explicitly aloof from the seven years\u2019 war on the continent of Europe. Later, while Horatio Nelson\u2019s victories were essential to British interests, the Waterloo campaign could hardly, on David Cameron\u2019s terms, have been avoided by earlier intervention. Nor did Napoleon Bonaparte pose a serious threat to Britain. Victorian Britain stayed out of Europe. Its sole intervention, Crimea, was a disaster. Cameron forgets perhaps his most successful Tory predecessor, Lord Salisbury, who said of intervening in other states\u2019 affairs (surely the essence of the EU) that there was \u201cno practice which the experience of nations more uniformly condemns.\u201d His policy was declared to be of \u201csplendid isolation\u201d.   Related: EU referendum: Cameron warns that leaving EU could put peace at risk - Politics live    Cameron\u2019s apparent thesis that the first world war could have been prevented by earlier British intervention is illiterate. We could as well argue that it was in part caused by an incipient EU, the Triple Alliance against Germany expansionism. The second world war was, of course, the great exception, but any idea that Britain could have promoted peace by declaring war on Hitler earlier than in 1939 is fanciful. When Cameron cites recent wars in the Middle East, what did they have to do with Britain\u2019s EU membership? As for Iraq as a guide to anything, if I were Cameron I would stay silent. If British history is to be cited in this debate, it is a sustained, overwhelming, irrefutable argument for Brexit. But that, of course, should not guide the future. History should be studied, not repeated \u2013 and best left to historians.",
