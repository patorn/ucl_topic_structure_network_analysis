Bandmates Jona Bechtolt and Claire Evans, who are in a relationship, announced on Monday on the group\u2019s Facebook page that a sex tape had been released online \u201cwithout our previous knowledge nor consent\u201d. \u201cWe hope you understand that this is not a delicious scandal. This is an exploitation,\u201d wrote the electro dance duo. The band announced it was going to try to make the best of the bad situation and sell the video for $5 on its site.  On Tuesday Jezebel revealed that the whole thing was a scheme weeks in the making to advertise a new music video.  Yacht quickly admitted that the whole story was \u201cfiction\u201d. The band wrote: \u201cWe created a story that was quickly revealed as fiction by the internet. We expected interest, skepticism, and laughter. We didn\u2019t anticipate the outpouring of genuine support, due partially to the credulity with which this story was so extensively and immediately reported.   Related: Revenge porn: the industry profiting from online abuse    \u201cWe did make a \u2018sex tape\u2019, and we want you to watch it. We released it as a slowly-unveiling conspiracy, inspired in equal part by The X-Files, Nathan for You, and The KLF. It\u2019s a project that allowed us to play with science fiction, the attention economy, clickbait journalism, and celebrity sex tapes all at once.\u201d \u201cThis is a bullshit marketing stunt,\u201d said lawyer Carrie Goldberg, whose New York City law firm focuses on internet harassment and sexual assault litigation. \u201cAs somebody who spends all day, every day working with actual victims of nonconsensual porn and rapes that have videos and gone viral, I just thought: where are these guys, I\u2019m going to come and hunt them down,\u201d said Goldberg. Nonconsensual porn, often known as \u201crevenge porn\u201d, is a growing and disturbing phenomena where sexual videos, photos and messages are leaked online without consent. In 2014, video of a Houston 16-year-old woman passed out and half-naked after being raped went viral on Twitter. Now 31 states have legislation against the distribution of revenge porn, with 28 of those states introducing legislation since 2012.  \u201cFor every state that passes a law, there\u2019s a backlash that says these women got what they deserved,\u201d said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at University of Miami and the vice-president of Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, who called Yacht\u2019s actions \u201cappalling\u201d. Underneath the band\u2019s initial announcement, many fans expressed solidarity and empathy with the news, saying they wouldn\u2019t view the video and expressing sympathy about its release. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken this moment of evolution \u2013 that we as a society can be proud of, people can express sympathy and support of victims, rather than ridicule or blaming them \u2013 but what this band has done is exploited that,\u201d said Franks. While some well-known friends of the band seemed to be in on the stunt \u2013 including artist Miranda July \u2013 other musicians, such as Best Coast, expressed their disgust.    Playing the victim + exploiting your fans as a PR stunt isn't some bold, cutting edge shit- it's just a real shitty asshole thing to do.\u2014 Best Coast (@BestCoast) May 10, 2016    The band\u2019s public relations representatives, Motormouthmedia, quickly distanced itself from the sex tape scheme, saying it had advised the band the hoax would be problematic.    It's time to state this. We are not involved in the Yacht situation in any way the idea was devised and executed 100% without us.\u2014 Motormouthmedia Judy (@motormouthmedia) May 10, 2016      I did not want to say anything at all, but our friends and media are all asking. we did write the band expressing our concern.\u2014 Motormouthmedia Judy (@motormouthmedia) May 10, 2016    Yacht tried to explain the video they did eventually release \u2013 which resembles a homemade sex tape but quickly becomes a sci-fi alien romp \u2013 as a play on celebrity sex tapes. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s disturbing to us that press outlets could make the incredibly irresponsible leap from \u2018celebrity sex tape,\u2019 which is the cultural trope this project explicitly references, to \u2018revenge porn,\u2019 which is unfunny, disgusting, morally repugnant, and completely unrelated,\u201d said the band in its statement. Franks dismissed Yacht\u2019s claim, noting their explanation \u201cmeans they have no idea what revenge porn is and they don\u2019t believe that celebrities have the right to sexual privacy\u201d. Brooklyn lawyer Goldberg said she has had 50 women in the last month contact her about unwanted photo and videos being spread online, and Yacht\u2019s actions simply make it harder for victims. \u201cMy fear is that next time somebody\u2019s sex video goes viral without consent everyone\u2019s going to stop and say: \u2018Wait wait wait, we can\u2019t believe her, this is just a stunt\u2019,\u201d she said.",
