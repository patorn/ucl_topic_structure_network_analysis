And every week people have similar feelings when they go out at night with their friends. But\u00a0nightlife is not only important because people enjoy it. Earning an estimated \u00a366bn a year and employing almost 8% of the workforce, Britain\u2019s night-time sector is of huge economic and cultural significance.   Related: Public house music: Mark Fell on making art in a derelict boozer    This is why people who care about music should be concerned that nightclubs are closing. During the past 10 years the number has reduced from 3,144\u00a0to 1,733. From the Arches in Glasgow to Garlands in Liverpool, London\u2019s Madame Jojo\u2019s and the Astoria, iconic venues are shutting their doors. London\u2019s Dance Tunnel is the latest to go. What happens at night is starting to concentrate minds, and rightly so. A commission is considering how London\u2019s night-time economy is managed, and night tube services are scheduled to start soon. Just last week, the Night Time Industries Association launched a national campaign, #nightlifematters. And it does matter, even if you\u2019re not a clubber. The Bristol club and dance music scene is acclaimed for the role it played in the early days of the influential bands Massive Attack and Portishead. Think also of Acid Jazz Records. Set up by entrepreneur and DJ Eddie Pillar in 1988, and influenced by cross-genre club culture from the 60s to the 80s, it signed bands including Incognito, Brand New Heavies and Jamiroquai \u2013 as well as running the Blue Note in east London, which in turn hosted nights put on by Talvin Singh and Goldie\u2019s Metalheadz.

From techno, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and garage in the 90s to the\u00a0grime genre today, artists such as Dizzee Rascal, Tinie Tempah and Wiley\u00a0continue to thrive, yet the foundations on which they depend are\u00a0now under intense pressure. Bars and clubs also play their part in\u00a0urban regeneration. This was true in Liverpool in 1991, when Baa Bar opened, Cream established itself as one of the country\u2019s most successful club nights and a tapestry of fashion designers, recording studios, labels and graphic designers clustered around it. It remains true today, whether you look at Manchester, Brighton or Glasgow. Peckham in south London is unrecognisable from a decade or two ago: the Bussey Building and CLF Arts Cafe have been a big part of that change.   Related: Clubs picks of the week    Some businesses run out of steam, of course, and fashions change. But the steep increase in nightclub closures can be traced to changes in licensing and regulation. Over the past decade rules imposed by police and councils have developed in such a way that clubs are often now held responsible for crimes that occur at or even near them. No other business is punished when a crime happens on its premises, whether it is a bank robbery, a mugging at a shopping centre or a death in a car park. Yet attitudes to nightlife are different. In part this is because police forces facing cuts see nightlife as a drain on dwindling resources. Councils, meanwhile, face similar challenges and\u00a0have to respond to complaints from\u00a0people living near venues \u2013 sometimes in flats erected long after the businesses subsequently portrayed as\u00a0nuisance neighbours. There is no societal justification for this erosion of the night economy. Serious crime has decreased in Britain in the past 10 years; people have never behaved as well as they do now. It\u2019s about mindset. In Nashville, Las Vegas, Berlin and Amsterdam, they understand\u00a0the dividends from a robust nightlife sector. We need to hear less about the costs and more about the benefits in Britain.",
