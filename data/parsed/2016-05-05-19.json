  "body": "Leicester City are confident of holding on to Riyad Mahrez despite his agent saying there is a \u201c50/50 chance\u201d the Algeria international could leave this summer.   Related: Claudio Ranieri: \u2018Whoever arrives at Leicester must have the same spirit\u2019    The club will open talks over a new contract in the next couple of weeks in an attempt to ward off interest in the PFA Player of the Year. Claudio Ranieri claimed on Thursday he was 99% sure Mahrez would stay and Leicester\u2019s vice-chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, said he had spoken to the player and the 25-year-old was not looking to move. \u201cHe said: \u2018No, no, I want to stay,\u2019\u201d Srivaddhanaprabha reported. \u201cThis is what he wants. He wants to stay.\u201d Mahrez has been linked with Barcelona, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. He has three years to run on the contract he signed last August, in a deal believed to be worth around \u00a335,000 a week. The club are prepared to at least double that figure. However Mahrez\u2019s agent, Kamel Bengougam, asked whether his client could leave this summer, said: \u201cYes of course there is a possibility. When you have been playing the way Riyad has this season it is bound to attract attention. He is very happy with Leicester and of course it has been a fantastic season. They will play in the Champions League next year as well so he would be happy to stay. \u201cBut at his age if the opportunity comes to play for a big team then we would have to think about it. I\u2019d say it\u2019s 50/50 at the moment whether he stays or goes.\u201d Mahrez has been watched several times this season by scouts from Barcelona. \u201cWe have interest from the UK and overseas,\u201d Bengougam said. \u201cWe will have to see what develops over the next few weeks.\u201d   Related: Leicester vice-chairman intervened to force Jamie Vardy to focus    Srivaddhanaprabha indicated that Mahrez and others would get pay rises \u2013 \u201cI am super fair and happy to improve if they deserve something\u201d \u2013 and addressed concern among Leicester fans that the leading players could go. \u201cI understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say: \u2018He will stay\u2019 because at the end of the day it depends on the players and the clubs who want them, but we have no policy to sell the players and we don\u2019t have a problem with money,\u201d he said. Ranieri, asked whether he expected Mahrez to remain at the club, said: \u201cI\u2019m very, very confident. I suggest to all my players to stay one year more.\u201d",
