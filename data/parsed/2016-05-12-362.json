  "body": "Forty-five people have reported being injured by their Thermomix cooking appliance and the company has been accused of blaming the victim and downplaying the danger posed by the device. Consumer advocacy group Choice has collated a mass incident report \u2013 citing 87 Thermomix complaints, of which 18 required treatment by a doctor or nurse. Eight people were hospitalised and one victim was treated in a specialist burns unit for three weeks. The appliance, which costs around $2,000, is a kitchen cooker and processor in one. It can cook pasta, stew meats, boil liquids, steam vegetables, crush ice or grill meats, amongst other things. Choice received 83 complaints regarding the TM31 model which was recalled in October 2014. Choice said it wanted the Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner (ACCC) to investigate.   Related: Forget the Thermomix - your kitchen appliances have secret powers    One customer reported being burnt by hot soup when using the appliance. Another reported hospitalisation and permanent scarring from Thermomix failures, yet many were told \u201cuser error\u201d was to blame when they notified the company, Choice\u2019s spokesman Tom Godfrey said on Thursday. \u201cIt is deeply concerning that, in a number of cases, when the company was informed of an incident they blamed the consumer by classifying the product\u2019s failure as \u2018user error\u2019,\u201d Godfrey said.  He said Thermomix should have reported issues to the federal consumer affairs minister on at least 10 occasions following customer injuries. Choice said consumers had reported Thermomix accidents more than a year before the TM31 was listed on the ACCC\u2019s Product Safety Recalls Australia website.  \u201cUnder ACCC\u2019s mandatory reporting guidelines a supplier must provide written notice to the commonwealth minister for consumer affairs within two days of becoming aware that someone suffered a serious injury or illness that was caused [or may have been caused] by the use or foreseeable misuse of their product,\u201d said Godfrey. \u201cBased on the incidents identified in our report, it appears Thermomix should have made at least two mandatory reports before October 2014 and another eight after that date. \u201cA responsible company should have acted quickly to address any dangers with products but, based on consumer reports, Thermomix Australia took more than a year between initial notification and recall.\u201d Thermomix on Thursday said it was aware of the allegations contained in the Choice report. \u201cThe safety, welfare and support of our customers is, and always has been, our highest priority,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding it had always cooperated with the ACCC and would continue to do so.
