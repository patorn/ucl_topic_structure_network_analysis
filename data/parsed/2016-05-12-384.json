  "body": "Tasmania will provide an intriguing election sideshow to the big island ballyhoo in the battleground states. The state has just five federal electorates \u2013 three Liberal, one Labor and one independent \u2013 but 12 senators for a population of a little over 500,000 people. What it lacks in lower house grunt, it more than makes up for in Senate firepower per capita.  And it\u2019s the Senate that will provide the main act in what should be an entertaining election campaign \u2013 particularly in a double-dissolution election year.   Related: Tasmania election: Greens and Labor blame each other for poor results    At a normal election, six senators are up for election (as with every other state). To win a spot a candidate needs a quota of 14.3%. In 2013 in Tasmania, that was about 48,000 votes. At a double dissolution that figure is roughly halved to 7.7% \u2013 or just 24,000 votes. Compare that with the quota needed in New South Wales at the 2013 election of 625,000 and it\u2019s obvious that it doesn\u2019t take much to throw results off-course in the diminutive southern state. The Liberals are still riding high with a commanding lead in opinion polls at the state-government level after the victory of Will Hodgman in the 2014 election, which ended 16 years of Labor party rule. And in 2013 the party picked up three federal seats, helping propel the former prime minister Tony Abbott to victory. But for all the party\u2019s successes in the traditionally Labor-dominated state, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, may struggle for an invitation to campaign there.

Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP    Out of the seven federal Liberals, only one \u2013 Senator Richard Colbeck \u2013 supported Turnbull\u2019s challenge to become prime minister, winning himself a promotion to the tourism portfolio, but a demotion to a career-threatening fifth on the Senate ticket by the state\u2019s Liberal headquarters. The Tasmanian Liberals, led by Eric Abetz and dominated by Abbott-cheering conservatives, hold four Senate seats and three lower house seats. Those three electorates are all marginal \u2013 Lyons is held by just 1.2%, Braddon by 2.6% and Bass by 4% \u2013 and were all won from Labor at the 2013 election. But will the self-described \u201cthree amigos\u201d holding the seats \u2013 Eric Hutchinson in Lyons, Brett Whiteley in Braddon and Andrew Nikolic in Bass \u2013 ride again?  There is no state-focused polling to draw upon, but the Tasmania-based election analyst and blogger Kevin Bonham says the effects of the sophomore surge combined with national polling mean it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be unseated.   \u201cThe new members will get a new personal vote at this election, replacing the personal vote of the previous Labor members in those seats,\u201d Bonham says. \u201cThey will get a leg-up from that and those seats are not as marginal as they look because of it.\u201d The University of Tasmania political scientist Dr Richard Eccleston agrees, but warns Nikolic could be in for a bumpy ride. \u201cIt\u2019s being argued that Nikolic is the most vulnerable of [the] three,\u201d Eccleston says. \u201cHe\u2019s been a strong, outspoken supporter of Tony Abbott and the Labor candidate Ross Hart is a relatively high-profile local solicitor who has been running a strong campaign.\u201d     Tony Abbott eats a raw onion in Tasmania in March 2015. The former PM still has support among many of the Tasmanian Liberals, only one of whom supported Turnbull in the leadership challenge. Photograph: ABC    In the Senate, both experts say the government will hold all four of its current seats but Bonham says there might be a few surprises owing to the party\u2019s unpopular preselection choices. \u201c[There were] no women, [they] stacked the ticket with rightwingers, and demoted their only moderate senator [Colbeck] to a difficult position,\u201d Bonham said. \u201cThere could be quite a bit of voting below the line in Tasmania and that might provide some interesting results.\u201d Eccleston says the Liberals\u2019 decision to run an all-male ticket and the sidelining of Colbeck was not a good look for the party.   Related: Tasmania election: an uneasy sense of deja vu hangs over Labor    \u201cEric Abetz is a controversial and divisive figure. Colbeck\u2019s relegation raised eyebrows. This could lead to Liberal voters voting below the line and allocating their own preferences, leading to leakage from the Liberal ticket.\u201d Labor can retain its five Senate seats but, both experts say, it will likely have to do so by taking the tricky 12th Senate spot, something of a preferences lottery. If it fails, that 12th spot could be left open for a third Green or Jacqui Lambie\u2019s running mate, the Rural Health Tasmania chief executive, Rob Waterman. Lambie\u2019s Jacqui Lambie Network is expected to gain at least a quota, both experts say, a task made easier for her by the double dissolution. In 2013, running under the Palmer United party banner, she obtained 22,184 votes in total \u2013 or 6.58%, just shy of what she will need for an outright quota this time around. Bonham points out that Tasmania has an affection for electing independents to the Senate. The conservative independent Brian Harradine was Australia\u2019s longest serving independent senator, representing the state from 1975 until 2005. \u201c[Lambie\u2019s] made enough noise to have a high-enough profile, [and] seems to have avoided saying so many stupid things as she\u2019s gained experience,\u201d he said. Eccleston says Lambie is likely to have reasonable support. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been tested but it\u2019s your traditional blue-collar support base. Although, geographically her stronghold is the north-west coast, a Liberal stronghold. The Liberals have more to fear from Lambie than Labor.\u201d Bonham says the Greens will hold their two Senate spots, while Eccleston tips a possible third seat \u2013 the same 12th spot that will be decided on a mess of preferences. \u201cIf there\u2019s a bitter, underwhelming, opportunistic campaign between the major parties then that will certainly benefit the Greens in Tasmania,\u201d Eccleston says. \u201cThe Greens could get a third seat. That\u2019s one of the reasons why, for the last 20 years, there\u2019s been a reluctance to call a double dissolution, because of the worry it will increase the Greens\u2019 Senate representation.\u201d Meanwhile, the independent Andrew Wilkie in the lower house seat of Denison should win comfortably. He has already hit the airwaves this week saying he wouldn\u2019t support any party to form government in the event of a hung parliament, surely a sign of confidence? If a hung parliament does eventuate, and a Tasmanian holds the casting vote, it would be a turnaround for the underdog of the federation. And we\u2019ll find out in just 53 days from now. Don\u2019t hold your breath.  \u2022 Paul Carter is a Hobart-based freelance journalist",
