  "body": "Purists may well be horrified by the idea of diluting a perfectly good ale, but a ginger beer top brings a welcome new dimension. We often serve this at The Ethicurean with a spiced tomato and fennel soup that\u2019s very much in the style of food from southern India, and the drink would be a great pairing with hot curries, too. It couldn\u2019t be much easier to make, either. Serves two. 500ml black IPA (I use Thornbridge Wild Raven)200ml ginger beer (I use Fentimans) Split the IPA between two glasses and top with ginger beer. That\u2019s it. \u2022 Jack Adair Bevan is a drinks writer, a founder of The Ethicurean in Bristol and co-creator of The Collector vermouth.",
