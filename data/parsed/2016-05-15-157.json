  "body": "\u2018My mum is always pestering me to do various charitable events,\u201d says Jo Brand, hunkering down into a deep armchair. \u201cSo recently I did a talk at her library to raise money, and there was a Q&A afterwards. And the first question was: \u2018What\u2019s it like to be hated?\u2019\u201d Her expression is impassive; an unflappability perhaps developed in her first career as a psychiatric nurse dealing with highly unstable inmates in an emergency ward. Brand continues, her voice unchanged: \u201cSo that was a nice one to start on.\u201d We are in the Observer\u2019s office in King\u2019s Cross for Brand to negotiate our occasional feature You Ask the Questions \u2013 \u201cyou\u201d being you, the readers, and a smattering of celebrities whose paths the 58-year-old comedian has crossed in three decades of standup and television appearances. Good news, I say: no one has asked that. \u201cI don\u2019t mind even if they have,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m ready for anything.\u201d Brand, as that tactful person in her mum\u2019s library noted, has been a divisive figure. The first time she performed live, according to legend, a male heckler shouted \u201cFuck off, you fat cow\u201d for most of her set. In the 1980s and 1990s especially, there was a strongly feminist tone to her comedy, which was enough to see her labelled anti-men or, in extreme cases, a lesbian. (For the record, Brand is married to Bernie, a psychiatric nurse, and they have two children.) \u201cWhen people insulted me in the press, they always picked on the very obvious thing: weight, how you look, how you dress; you don\u2019t wear dresses very often ergo you are a lesbian \u2013 like that\u2019s a big insult anyway,\u201d says Brand. \u201cHave they not heard of pretty lesbians that wear dresses? They obviously hadn\u2019t in those days. It obviously meant that you looked like a plumber.\u201d These days, though, Brand is clearly regarded more fondly. More than one question submitted for this feature referred to her as \u201ca national treasure\u201d. There are maybe two main reasons for the change in the perception. One was the Hell of a Walk that she completed in January for Sport Relief. She stomped from one side of the country to the other \u2013 135 miles from the mouth of the Humber to Liverpool \u2013 in seven days and raised more than \u00a31m. It was clearly a gruelling effort that took a lot out of Brand and she \u2013 unlike some celebrity challengers \u2013 did not hide this fact from the cameras. \u201cI realise I was quite bad tempered,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I do think it\u2019s fairly reasonable to demonstrate that you have the same moods as other people would have if they were in the same position. There was this teacher who walked along with me at about 6pm and she said, \u2018Do you mind if I walk with you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t mind but I\u2019m in a really bad mood and I might be quite rude to you.\u2019 And she said, \u2018No, that\u2019s perfectly all right.\u2019 \u201cThen she said to me, \u2018Can I tell my pupils I haven\u2019t marked their homework because I\u2019m walking with you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Do what you want!\u2019 And she went, \u2018How dare you!\u2019 and got in a real tizz and walked off. That was the desired result but I thought, \u2018Well, I did tell you I was grumpy\u2026\u2019 So I did try to warn people.\u201d         The trailer for Jo Brand\u2019s new sitcom Going Forward.    Another reason for the surge in affection for Brand was the BBC4 comedy Getting On, in which she played a nurse called Kim Wilde who worked in a female geriatric ward. The show, which she created with Vicki Pepperdine and Joanna Scanlan, ran for three series from 2009 to 2012 and won Brand a Bafta in 2010 for her performance. It was a warm, naturalistic turn and she will be reprising the role of Kim \u2013 minus Pepperdine and Scanlan \u2013 in a new spin-off, Going Forward, which will be shown in three instalments on BBC4 later this month. In Going Forward, Kim has left the NHS and now works as a care assistant in the community, dashing between appointments with her elderly patients and juggling a chaotic home life. Her husband Dave, played by Omid Djalili, is a private-hire car driver and similarly embattled. The series has a few serious points to make \u2013 notably about private companies taking over health provision, and zero-hours contracts \u2013 but Brand was determined that it should be a comedy above all else. \u201cOh yes, if you\u2019re doing comedy, you must be funny first and preach second,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause if you do it the other way around then it\u2019s just irritating for people. We\u2019d just be doing a party political broadcast.\u201d After three series of Getting On, a split developed between its creators. \u201cThere were substantial differences between the ways which we worked, because Jo and Vicky were actors and I\u2019m a standup,\u201d Brand says. \u201cWe tried to improvise most of it and, they may say that I\u2019m wrong over this, but I think they felt more comfortable not doing that. So I suppose by the end of three series, we were separating out a bit and looking at going different ways. And they were keen to go to the States\u201d \u2013 where the show has been reimagined by HBO, and Pepperdine and Scanlan have both taken cameos \u2013 \u201cand I wasn\u2019t.\u201d With Djalili especially, Brand felt more relaxed drifting off script. \u201cOh, the whole thing is improvised,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a narrative, because we couldn\u2019t improvise the plot as we went along. We knew that in this episode Dave is going to find out that his pay has been substantially cut because of all the extras, paying for renting this, that and the other from the car firm. But yeah, there was no script as such.\u201d Such light-footedness should be perfect preparation for doing You Ask the Questions then \u2013 and so it turns out. You ask the questions      Do you wish you were starting now, when female comedians are just allowed to be comedians, or did you enjoy being a trailblazer?Stewart Lee, comedianOoh, well thank you Stewart for calling me a trailblazer. No, I\u2019m happy with the time I did start out. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that I was a trailblazer, but it was a much more exciting time really. What we called \u201calternative comedy\u201d was in its infancy and the atmosphere at clubs was fantastic. You used to have the weirdest people on the circuit. There was a guy who melted a block of ice with a blowtorch and that was his act. He was called the Iceman, unsurprisingly. There was a woman who used to make very rude noises through her vagina, who would go down very well at the Tunnel Club [the notorious 1980s venue in east London] because they like that sort of thing down there. Standup has all become a bit more commercial and a bit slicker. And I certainly wasn\u2019t slick. Women performers like Sarah Millican and Bridget Christie are very polished and not nearly as badly organised as I am. They work much harder. I felt like I just winged it quite a lot and it was easier in those days to do that.      You used to go on stage for years as the \u201cSea Monster\u201d instead of your own name, which I\u2019ve always loved. Do you still remember some of your first standup sets and has your style changed much from when you started?Aisling Bea, comedian and actor Yeah, I remember those days very well. The Sea Monster was merely to cover up my true identity in case people from work came to see me. Because I was a psychiatric nurse and I didn\u2019t really want anyone to know I was doing it. So I just wanted a few months without anyone there. That went on for about six months to a year. Two things I remember about starting were, one, I was very nervous and I didn\u2019t know how to deliver a comedy line, so I did it in a monotone way. The first review I ever got at the Edinburgh festival said I sounded like I was reading the football results. And it was perfectly fair. The other thing was that I had a lot of hit-and-miss jokes. My favourite was where I\u2019d hold a blood capsule in my mouth just before I came on and I\u2019d wear a big white T-shirt. The compere would say: \u201cPlease welcome the Sea Monster\u2026\u201d and I\u2019d go on, cough all over this shirt and then say, \u201cMust give up smoking.\u201d No one ever really laughed at it except me.      What\u2019s the latest you\u2019ve ever turned up to a gig (your own) and why?Isy Suttie, comedianWell, it\u2019s such a long time ago, I feel I can say this now. Mark Thomas and I were doing a gig in Aberdeen and we were flying up from Heathrow on a Friday night and neither of us wanted to go. So we deliberately missed the flight and then we phoned Off the Kerb, [the talent agency] whose gig it was, and said to Joe Norris: \u201cWe\u2019ve missed the flight and we can\u2019t do the gig.\u201d And he went, \u201cJust hang on there.\u201d And he rang back 10 minutes later and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got you on the next one.\u201d So we arrived at the gig two hours late and the audience was in such a bad mood that we both died on our arses. It served us right \u2013 I never did that again.      When sectors of the press launched a sustained and personal attack on you, and invented lies to push their own tabloid agenda of generating hatred, how did you manage to remain funny, and keep creating great work?Shazia Mirza, comedianOccasionally I\u2019ll read about a celebrity complaining about the way they\u2019ve been treated by the press and however realistic and valid that complaint is, they always look like an arse. So that teaches you that you can\u2019t complain about things, because there are people that don\u2019t have enough to eat and you\u2019re saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t like Gary Bushell calling me fat\u201d or whatever it is. What helped with me was, having been a psychiatric nurse for a long time, having been in charge of the psychiatric A&E where I worked, some very difficult, challenging, potentially very violent people would come in and they would want something, either to be admitted or some methadone and, because I was in charge, I was always wheeled out to tell them that they couldn\u2019t. So I really got used to getting a mouthful of quite horrendous abuse on a regular basis. So there we are: you just have to deal with it really. Where in the world do you find peace from the noise of life?Davina McCall, TV presenterWhen I\u2019m asleep, I suppose, or watching someone being horribly murdered on TV. That\u2019s a bit odd. I find peace when someone\u2019s having a plastic bag put over their head.      If you were an absolute ruler of Britain for the day, what new law would you bring in immediately and which current law would you abolish?Shappi Khorsandi, comedianI would abolish public schools. And what would I bring in? I\u2019d bring back Sure Start, because that was a fantastic initiative and the fact it\u2019s gone has really left a massive hole. When children are at that very vulnerable age before five, that\u2019s when anything that\u2019s going to be negative in their later life starts to formulate. If you can catch them early and put them on a more positive road then that\u2019s the time to do it. Also \u2013 people that say they are going to leave the country if the Labour party get in, I\u2019d make it law that they actually had to. Loads of them do that and it\u2019s really annoying.      You\u2019ve been a huge inspiration to me professionally, but you\u2019ve also always struck me as fundamentally a fair and reasonable, level-headed person who cares deeply about humanity. You work tirelessly for mental health charities \u2013 raising awareness and funds \u2013 and also give your time generously to many other causes. You\u2019re never cruel and, to me at least, seem to have perfect judgment on all manner of things, especially politicians. With that in mind, if you were having dinner with Jeremy Hunt and Donald Trump, in a deserted restaurant with no one else around for miles, and they both started choking at the same time, who would you choose to give the Heimlich manoeuvre to, and why?Bridget Christie, comedianI\u2019d give it to Jeremy Hunt, because globally he\u2019s much less of a threat than Donald Trump. Because given that Donald Trump now has the Republican nomination in the bag, that means that it\u2019s actually a possibility that he could be\u2026 Can you even believe it? But Americans are a totally different kettle of fish voting-wise and a vast majority of them, just because he says he\u2019s going to build a wall between America and Mexico, might go for him. Jeremy Hunt, well, he\u2019s just a problem in England really, so I\u2019d have to Heimlich manoeuvre him.      What\u2019s the most hilariously crazy act you remember from the 1980s?Mark Steel, comedianWe\u2019ve already talked about vagina woman, she was very crazy. And of course Chris Lynam, who used to put a firework up his arse at the end of his act and on occasion burned himself quite badly. But it looked amazing because he\u2019s got such a demonic elfin face, with his big hair and loads of eyeliner. So a lot of brilliant craziness.      What nourishes you? (Apart from crusty white bloomer dipped in salad cream.)Tamsin Greig, actorYes, we found that we both really, really like that. We felt bad about it because we know actually it\u2019s very working class to like salad cream. And that Yotam Ottolenghi has never used salad cream in a recipe once. Errr, what nourishes me? Gawd. It used to be fags. I used to so love smoking. So much. More than anything. It looks visually like it\u2019s food I really love but actually it was always smoking. I gave up when I was 39 before I had kids and then I started again about five years later in a \u201cI can control this\u201d kind of way, when I really couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s probably been about three years now, with a few blips along the way.      You gave me a lift back from a gig at Oxford Poly in about 1992 and wouldn\u2019t take any petrol money. I feel I owe you \u00a35 plus 24 years of interest. Where would you like me to send this sum?Richard Herring, comedianHaha! I remember that gig really well actually. I used to be the comedy circuit driver and counsellor really. So I was always the one that was sober who would give a load of really pissed people a lift home and I would actually do that thing of dropping people at their houses. It kind of came back to haunt me a few times. One of my mum\u2019s favourite sayings is: \u201cNo good deed ever goes unpunished.\u201d And it\u2019s so true in a way. I once borrowed a friend\u2019s car and took a load of comics up to Nottingham University for a gig. On the way back, we all decided to stop for breakfast at 3am at Scratchwood services and I went in the wrong car park and a French juggernaut reversed into the car. He broke both of the headlights and punctured the radiator and then when he heard the crunch, we all had to do O-level French: there was Bob Mills, Mandy Knight and Johnny Immaterial all going: \u201cBon soir.\u201d That did put me off giving people lifts for a bit, but I never asked people for petrol money and so he doesn\u2019t owe me a thing. And thank you for remembering, Richard.      Is your character Kim on a zero-hours contract? And if so, how do you feel about that? Also, is she getting paid for travelling time between appointments?Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green PartyYes, she is on a zero-hours contract and no, she isn\u2019t getting paid for travelling. I think what she thinks about it as a character is really what I think about it as a person, which is, I think it opens the floodgates for all sorts of unacceptable employment law. It encourages lots of nefarious work practices and it\u2019s a really backwards step in a civilised country that led the way with the NHS. So I find it really depressing.      Are you going to the FA Cup final?Alan Davies, comedianNo, I\u2019m not, because I simply can\u2019t stand the stress of it. I went to the play-offs before Crystal Palace went up into the Premier League and I just found it excruciating because it\u2019s a weird mixture of wanting to focus on the match and being really nervous and stressed, but loads of people coming up and saying, \u201cOh, hi! How are you?\u201d And not being able to say, \u201cOh fuck off, I\u2019m concentrating on this\u2026\u201d So I just decided that I can\u2019t do that again and I won\u2019t even watch the match, I\u2019ll just have text alerts on, so I know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a bit pathetic, but I\u2019m in the age of the stroke zone anyway, so if I went I might have a stroke and I don\u2019t want to. So lots of reasons.      After a hard day I favour cake and swearing, but what\u2019s your recipe for days when life kicks you in the arse?Kerry Hudson, authorAfter a hard day, what really sorts me out is watching some sort of hideous Scandinavian thriller with subtitles, people murdering each other in a really horrible way. The Killing, The Bridge, I love all those. Is being married better than being single?Shermaine Williams, by emailOh, I don\u2019t think you can possibly say that. For me personally or for everyone? Being in an awful marriage is so much worse than being single, so it\u2019s very dependent on who you are married to really. And, just to be annoying, research shows that being married is better for the man and worse for the woman \u2013 surprise surprise. But personally I like being married because it takes the effort out of life. You don\u2019t have to look any more, and you don\u2019t have to bother any more. That\u2019s my motto: don\u2019t look any more and don\u2019t bother! How different is your on-stage persona from how you would be at a dinner party, say?Bo Palle Hansen, by emailIt\u2019s very different. Along with a lot of other people, my on-stage persona is quite contrived in a way. I say outrageous things to get a reaction from people. When I started, because I had a very heavily uncompromising feminist set, it was really designed to wind people up \u2013 not just men, women as well. And to shock people, because I think in those days women [comedians] were few and far between and in a way, in order to get your voice heard, you had to say something outrageous. But no, I\u2019m totally different from how I am on stage. I don\u2019t really go to dinner parties, but when I\u2019m socialising, thankfully I socialise with people who don\u2019t expect me to do jokes all the time. That would be so wearing \u2013 for them as well as me.   Related: Jo Brand\u2019s Hell of a Walk review \u2013 oddly lovely and a little bit inspiring    How horrible was the Hell of a Walk when you were doing it and how good did you feel afterwards? Mad respect by the way.Veryumble, posted onlineThank you very much. I\u2019d say the first two hours of each day were great and then it started to very gradually all dribble away positivity-wise after that. By the time it got dark, we\u2019d have been walking for about eight or nine hours, so it started to hurt a bit and also Greg my trainer, he\u2019s a terrible liar, because he always used to say it was much nearer than it actually was. I think that\u2019s some sort of psychological ploy to make you keep going, but it really got on my nerves. When I\u2019d actually finished it, you\u2019re taken up so much with what\u2019s going on around you, a bit of your brain just shuts off. So I didn\u2019t even think about it for a couple of days. Then a week later, I thought it was all some horrible nightmare that hadn\u2019t really happened. Cake \u2013 Greggs, Patisserie Valerie, homemade, baked-off, or Mary Berried?onalongsabbatical, posted onlineCrikey, I think homemade actually \u2013 not me, my daughters are quite good at cooking. But I don\u2019t actually like cakes very much. I prefer savoury stuff. I know I started the cake thing, but the reason I started that was because, do you remember that Naughty But Nice cake campaign on telly? That was always people that looked like they\u2019d never been near a cake in their life. And I kind of felt it\u2019s time for people to say that the realistic end of eating a lot of cakes is that you look like me. But you\u2019re not really allowed to say that, because it\u2019s a shameful thing. Anyway, I\u2019d rather have something savoury to be honest. What do you miss most from your time as a psychiatric nurse? And what did you learn from it?buxtond, posted onlineWhat I miss most is working with a group of people in a very close way. It was an emergency clinic and there were a lot of situations that were quite dangerous unless they were managed properly. So having a group of us who all knew what we were doing and being able to manage quite hair-raising situations is very satisfying really. We wouldn\u2019t always sort things out, but the vast majority of the time we could at least do something. So from that point of view, you can\u2019t follow every audience member home and go, \u201cDid you have a laugh? Do you feel better?\u201d What I learned from it is that in many ways I was very naive. We are encouraged by the tabloid side of the press to think people with mental-health issues are nothing like us. And I learned that\u2019s simply isn\u2019t the way things are when I found out my dad had a quite a serious depression, and that wasn\u2019t until after I\u2019d actually become a nurse really. So you think, \u201cWell, that\u2019s in my family and it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s family in some way or another. Everyone is affected by it.\u201d God forbid that the grim reaper should get his hands on you this year, but what sketch or comedic creation would you most like to be remembered for?Angela Young, posted onlineI\u2019d quite like my Britney Spears on Let\u2019s Dance for Comic Relief to be remembered. Not really. Although the headmistress of my daughter\u2019s school did say to me: \u201cCan you come to school dressed up as Britney Spears?\u201d My reply had the word \u201cfuck\u201d in it. Well, I suppose it would be Kim Wilde, but also years ago, when I did the two series of Through the Cakehole for Channel 4, we did a police spoof called Drudge Squad. It was about two policewomen who were dealing with families and annoying husbands, so you\u2019d have lots of going to the scene of the crime with a baby and the babyseat is in the back. I liked that character, and would have liked to do more with her, but there\u2019s always time. Or not, if the grim reaper\u2019s coming. We\u2019ll just see if I\u2019m dead or not. If I\u2019m not dead I\u2019ll do it. But if I do die before the end of the year, I hope you caused that by asking me about it.         Jo Brand\u2019s appearance on Let\u2019s Dance for Comic Relief.    Should junior doctors go on strike?Courage8591, posted onlineYeah, I believe that anyone should go on strike, and I think they do have a very good case. I\u2019m not sure about the relationship between striking and emergency cover, I\u2019d like to see at least a skeletal emergency cover, that\u2019s quite important. But for them to go on strike they must be so desperate that to some extent it justifies that strike. And I\u2019ll tell Jeremy Hunt that while I\u2019m saving his life. I\u2019ve been arguing for years that you should be the next Doctor in Doctor Who. Please say you\u2019re up for it.tonymcgowan, posted onlineIs that my mum? I\u2019d like to see a female Doctor but not me, there\u2019s lots of really great women that could do it. I always thought Miriam Margolyes would make a great Doctor, because she is so out of control and I love her for it. I know that I did get voted top choice for Doctor Who on Smooth FM about seven years ago and that made my week, that did. I was very flattered. But I did think, \u201cPeople listening to soft jazz want me to be Doctor Who, why would that be?\u201d It\u2019s so weird. But you couldn\u2019t turn it down, it would be brilliant. OK, boring. What way, if any, will you vote in the EU referendum?simonsaint, posted onlineTo stay in, definitely. I mean, even if you\u2019re like a really shallow person who doesn\u2019t know what all the issues are, just look at the ones who are voting to leave and the ones that are voting to stay in. Do it on that basis and you\u2019ll find a way to vote stay. What was the last good book you read?MrFusiello, posted onlineIt\u2019s called John McPake and the Sea Beggars by Stuart Campbell. It\u2019s a really odd book that moves between a hostel for people with mental-health problems in Edinburgh in the current day and the contents of a Breughel painting. The main character is schizophrenic and he has delusional ideas about this particular painting called The Hunters in the Snow. That makes me sound rather more intelligent than I am but it\u2019s written by an English teacher and it\u2019s very accurate historically. It\u2019s just a fantastic read and if anyone wants to know what it\u2019s like to be schizophrenic and to hear voices, it\u2019s a very readable and very funny book.     Brand with Omid Djalili in Going Forward. Photograph: Brian Ritchie/BBC    Who was the last new British comedian who really made you laugh?flangespaniel, posted onlineI think it was Tom Davis who is actually in Going Forward. I\u2019ve never seen him live, but I loved Murder in Successville: I just thought he was such a naturally funny person and just a very endearing character and I really liked the bigness of him. He must be about 6ft 6in and he looks like a big comedy yeti. I also liked the disrespect really that he has for people. That\u2019s a very important element of modern life, which should be attended to as often as possible. What\u2019s the best thing about getting older?Peachesandcreem, posted onlineNothing. There isn\u2019t anything good about getting older. I should say something positive. Well, one thing \u2013 but it\u2019s not getting older, like 60, 70, it\u2019s like 30, 40 \u2013 is that actually you care less what people think of you. When you\u2019re a teenager, someone looking at you makes you blush and feel embarrassed, but as you get older you have the facility to be a bit more gobby without caring quite so much what the reaction is. And that\u2019s a good thing. How can we improve the lives of people afflicted by mental illness?Judith Wright, via emailWell, I think we already are, to be honest. There are very strong lobbies on Twitter and other social media that always spring up whenever someone makes a negative or insulting comment about mental health. And it\u2019s really great when people that we all see on telly who are suffering from some sort of mental health issue speak up about it. I did a Mind conference recently and there was a woman \u2013 Frankie Bridge, who was in the Saturdays \u2013 who\u2019d had postnatal depression. She\u2019s young, gorgeous and looks totally in control of her life and yet she had terrible postnatal depression, which she\u2019s talked about. People really listen when someone like her is prepared to admit it \u2013 Paul Merton speaking about his episode when he was in hospital; Stephen Fry as well \u2013 because it defuses the whole mystery around it. And conversely it makes celebs seem like real people rather than the Greek gods that some people think they are. You were a nurse and now a successful comedian. Is there another career path you would liked to have taken?Gerry Blake, via emailI\u2019d have liked to be prime minister. It\u2019s too late now, thank God, so I can just say that and it doesn\u2019t mean anything any more.
