  "body": "Anti-euthanasia campaigners have targeted the UK premiere of the Hollywood adaptation of the novel Me Before You, which has faced criticism over its depiction of disability and its assisted-dying plotline. A group of activists unfurled a banner castigating it as a \u201cdisability snuff movie\u201d, as cast members including Emilia Clarke, Jenna Coleman and Joanna Lumley arrived on the the red carpet at the London event for the film, based on the best-selling novel by British author Jojo Moyes. Among the protesters was Sian Vasey, who was born with SMA (spinal muscular atrophy). She said: \u201cI know the basic plot, which is that the male lead has an accident and becomes disabled, but after a year or so of time in quite a happy relationship then decides that he doesn\u2019t want to be a burden and takes himself off to Dignitas to commit suicide.\u201d She and others from Not Dead Yet \u2013 a group that campaigned against the bill which would have changed the law to allow doctors to help terminally ill people end their lives, but which was rejected in September by MPs \u2013 chanted and briefly exchanged words with Moyes. The US branch of Not Dead Yet has said it plans to picket the film there. Clarke, the Game of Thrones star who is the film\u2019s romantic lead, told the Guardian, however, that it was \u201cnever our intention\u201d for the film to devalue people with disabilities.      \u201cI think that the movie is a Hollywood movie, but I think that what we are showing is something that we took a lot of care over, with Jojo being there as well, because she wrote the book first, so that\u2019s the story that we were going off,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were very careful with how we wanted to present things. And we are showing a situation, we are not showing an opinion.\u201d True to the novel, which has sold more than six million copies, the film is a love story centred around the relationship between Traynor, a quadriplegic former jet-setting banker played by Sam Claflin (best known for his role as Finnick Odair in The Hunger Games), and his carer, Lou, played by Clarke. Director Thea Sharrock told the Observer this week that the film offered a chance to pause and reflect on the real value of life. \u201cI wanted to stick to the universal theme of the simple and yet wonderful way these people fall in love, while creating a space for people to think about what matters,\u201d said Sharrock, adding that she saw the subjects of life-altering disability and the morality of euthanasia as difficult rather than \u201cdark\u201d.
