Related: Brexit could lead to recession, says Bank of England    The cabinet minister, a former miner, made the dire prediction in a speech at the Cambridge University Conservative Association, adding to recent warnings by the remain campaign about the potential economic impact of Brexit. \u201cWhen I was young, people didn\u2019t think mining would ever end,\u201d he said. \u201cI hear the Brexiteers make the same case about car manufacturing and farming today. Just as the under-educated and least well-off suffered worst from Labour\u2019s great recession after 2008. So they would be first to feel the pain of our departure from the EU.\u201d His warning that the poorest would suffer most from leaving the EU contrasts sharply with Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, and leading out campaigner, who argued this week that staying in could lead to an \u201cexplosion of havenots\u201d.      Patrick McLoughlin, secretary of state for transport. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Duncan Smith argued that the EU was a \u201cforce for social injustice\u201d, claiming Britain\u2019s membership increases the cost of living, lowers wages and restricts jobs. But McLoughlin argued the opposite, saying the consequences of a vote to leave \u201cwill not be shared out evenly\u201d across society with the poorest worst off. \u201cTo the already affluent, the well-educated and the economically secure the risks are low,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the poorest in our society who will feel the chilling effect of uncertainty first.\u201d   Related: Bank's warning of a Brexit double whammy is very handy for Osborne    It comes after a string of warnings about the possible economic impact of Brexit from the US president Barack Obama, the OECD, and the IMF.  On Thursday, the Bank of England warned Britain could slide into recession in the aftermath of a vote to leave the EU in next month\u2019s referendum. Vote Leave, the official out campaign, has consistently dismissed such reports as scaremongering from voices of the establishment.  Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said on Thursday: \u201cI don\u2019t think we need yet more forward guidance from the Bank. The governor should be careful that he doesn\u2019t cause a crisis. \u201cIf his unwise words become self-fulfilling, the responsibility will be the governor\u2019s and the governor\u2019s alone. A prudent governor would simply have said that \u2018we are prepared for all eventualities\u2019. \u201cThere are huge opportunities for the UK outside the EU. We are a strong economy and can stand on our own two feet like all other modern, independent countries.\u201d",
