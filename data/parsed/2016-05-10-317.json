  "body": "In the Club 9pm, BBC1 The second series of Kay Mellor\u2019s pregnancy and childbirth drama continues. Roanna (Hermione Norris) juggles her new baby and relationship with her dwindling finances. But will she tell Simon that she\u2019s going to her ex for help? As usual with Mellor (and this episode is written by her daughter Gaynor), the cast and characters are likable but it often strays into cliche. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you sleep at night,\u201d says Roanna to a bank employee refusing her a loan. Julia Raeside Old School With the Hairy Bikers  9pm, BBC2 Dave Myers and Si King leave pies and pubs behind and cross over into social experiments. The bikers ride to a struggling school near Oxford, where they launch a mentoring scheme that pairs teenagers with pensioners. What initially seems like a light-hearted and jolly chance to swap wisdom about smartphones and rationing soon becomes a more serious look at the scars both young and old bear: bereavement, loneliness and the lasting trauma of being bullied. Jack Seale Crash: Anatomy of an Accident 9pm, ITV When working for emergency services, you\u2019re expected to think fast. When dealing with one of Britain\u2019s worst-ever road accidents, a 130-car pile-up on a fog-covered motorway bridge, with the most seriously hurt likely to be least accessible, seconds of indecision could cost lives. That situation arose at Sheppey crossing, Kent, during a morning rush hour in September 2013. The impact on victims\u2019 lives and the measures needed to save them are explored here. Mark Gibbings-Jones How to Get a Council House 9pm, Channel 4 The series charting the work of council housing officers returns. We\u2019re in the London borough of Hounslow, where there are 3,000 households on the waiting list and \u2013 in a familiar story that needs retelling \u2013 the demand for social housing far exceeds supply. Those we meet include single mum Beverley, who faces an eviction that will also leave her 21-year-old epileptic son homeless; long-term sofa-surfer Billy, whose health is deteriorating, and Swapna and daughter Seetah, who live in a one-bedroom converted shed. Jonathan Wright Penguin A&E With Lorraine Kelly 9pm, Channel 5 The visual equivalent of a candyfloss binge, this documentary series follows staff at Cape Town\u2019s SANCCOB Western Cape Centre, AKA \u201cthe penguin hospital\u201d, treating our tuxedoed, flippered friends after their run-ins with dogs, cars or dehydration. Or swallowed fishing lines. As vet Romy says of little Bandit, \u201cIf there\u2019s a hook at the end of this, it could be catastrophic.\u201d Elsewhere, Peanut is placed in his own little steam room, and Nipper\u2019s \u201cstill quite out of it\u201d. Ali Catterall A League of Their Own US Road Trip 9pm, Sky1 The comedy panel show take a trip Stateside in this new series. James Corden is a bit of a star across the Atlantic, so he plays host to Jamie Redknapp, Andrew Flintoff and Jack Whitehall as they join him for a boys\u2019 adventure across the US in an RV, taking in the views and undertaking various American-style competitive actitivities with forfeits for the loser. Will there be bantz? Ah yes, there will be bantz. David Stubbs Slasher 10pm, Pick From an Amityville-style house to deaths on Halloween and protagonists running around alone at night, this Canadian-American horror anthology series is largely derivative. As this first series begins, we meet Sarah and Dylan, a couple inexplicably moving into the home where Sarah\u2019s parents were murdered by a hooded assailant dubbed The Executioner. How long will it be before they\u2019re in danger? And could there be a decent mystery under all those cliches? Hannah J Davies Film choice Total Recall (Paul Verhoeven, 1990) 11.10pm, ITV4 This first spectacular, mega-budget adaptation of Philip K Dick\u2019s mind-bending tale is altogether smarter and more fun than the plodding 2012 remake. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at the top of his game as an ostensibly ordinary (though very large) labourer who slowly recalls he was once a secret agent, and powerful corporate forces have been messing with his mind. Cue dizzying paranoid delusions and state-of-the-art violence.
