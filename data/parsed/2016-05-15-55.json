We\u2019ve been making disparaging comments about Europe and the EU for too long. If the Eurovision results are \u201cpolitical\u201d, consider the real political arena. Anybody who says we\u2019ll get favourable trading terms with the EU, should we be so stupid as to leave, is living in cloud cuckoo land. The remaining 27 will want revenge.Duncan AndersonImmingham, Lincolnshire \u2022 After Saturday\u2019s Eurovision song contest performances, should we also have a referendum on whether to remain in the contest on the 23 June?Paresh MotlaThame, Oxfordshire \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de (Asia has yet to confront its past \u2013 be grateful Europe did, 14 May) claims that, unlike in China and Japan, \u201cin Europe the lessons of history have been spelled out and learned\u201d. Could she spell out how western European nations have acknowledged the lessons of their violent annexation and systematic exploitation of the non-western world, on the back of which so much contemporary European prosperity rests?Dr Miles LarmerAssociate professor of African history, University of Oxford \u2022 Plenty of Venetians and Neapolitans would dispute your reporter\u2019s description of Milan\u2019s La Scala as the birthplace of opera (Report, 12 May). Naples\u2019 Teatro di San Carlo opened in 1737, 41 years before La Scala, and remains one of Italy\u2019s major opera houses; opera was already flourishing in Venice in the 1600s; and Monteverdi\u2019s L\u2019Orfeo, the earliest opera still regularly performed, had its premiere in Mantua in 1607.Derek RobinsonMatlock, Derbyshire \u2022 The truthless pursuit of power (Post-truth politicians no joke, Opinion, 14\u00a0May)?Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
