  "body": "Bow down, good people of Soapland: it\u2019s Peggy Mitchell\u2019s manor this month and you\u2019re just living in it. The most fabulous matriarch EastEnders has ever seen may have been a shadow of her former self when she arrived back in the Square, but she provided many a tear-jerking moment before she departed for good on Tuesday. Despite the sad circumstances of her return, Peggy was a breath of straight-talking fresh air. The cutting one-liners that made her so very Peggy were still there. \u201cAt last! A decent hairdo,\u201d she said to Roxy, giving her the once-over. \u201cNot like those rats\u2019 tails you used to have.\u201d   Related: Babs calls time for the last time: farewell Peggy Mitchell, queen of EastEnders    Peggy\u2019s eyes flashed with fear as the doctors told her the cancer had spread to her brain, but she remained proud. \u201cCancer\u2019s not having the last word,\u201d she told Phil, \u201cI am.\u201d For one second there was a glimpse of the old Peggy, about to slap cancer round the face, call it an old tart and tell it to \u201cGet outta my pub!\u201d Only one woman had the power to reunite Mitchell brothers Phil and Grant (who let his one raised eyebrow do the talking as he made his comeback). And only one woman could bring a tear to the nation\u2019s eyes as she was paraded round the Square on the back of a milkfloat crooning It\u2019s Now Or Never. The fact that Dot rolled her eyes and gave her a lecture about growing old gracefully made that moment even more beautiful.     Bruv\u2026 Grant and Phil Mitchell. Photograph: Jack Barnes    Arch-enemy Sharon planned one last supper, pretending that her ex-mother-in-law didn\u2019t hate her, and even Shirl got involved on the cake-making front. \u201cI\u2019m no Mary Berry,\u201d she lamented. Ain\u2019t that the truth. Sharon fondly recalled the time she dared to order Peggy to get outta her pub. \u201cI told her if you don\u2019t stop waving that polished finger in my face you\u2019ll be picking those false eyelashes out of the ice bucket.\u201d Yeah, yeah, Sharon. Photos or it didn\u2019t happen.   Related: A short history of death on EastEnders    While all this was going on, EastEnders chanced a cheeky side story with Mick and Linda becoming embroiled in some kind of crazy wife-swapping escapade with Belinda and Neville. It was proper naughty pop-your-car-keys-in-the-fruit-bowl-and-I\u2019ll-show-you-my-ice-dispenser stuff, with Mick ending up trapped in a hot tub next to Neville\u2019s budgie smugglers, which is just the light relief EastEnders needed. But the real star of the show was Peggy. Let\u2019s not remember the old gal taking her own life rather than allowing cancer to get the final say (with the ghost of Pat Butcher alongside her). Instead, let\u2019s remember her drifting down the Thames with Phil, admiring the city she loved so much to the sound of Moon River. No, you\u2019ve got something in your mince pie.     A night on the lash\u2026 Kate and Gail. Photograph: Andrew Boyce    Over in Coronation Street, Gail was taking her first ever disco nap. The occasion? Carla\u2019s hen do, which was a work of genius. The hens assembled brandishing Carla\u2019s trademark. No, not a large Shiraz. They hit the town in long, dark, glossy wigs. Everything about that night was pure joy, from Carla belting out It\u2019s Raining Men to Gail\u2019s wonderment at being refreshed and on the loose in a nightclub. \u201cThis is what the Ha\u00e7ienda must have looked like,\u201d she marvelled.   Related: Soaps are the real beating heart of TV | Hannah Verdier    Of course no soap hen night would be complete without the gaggle mistaking a pair of policemen for strippers. \u201cIt was a very easy mistake to make,\u201d argued ringleader Drunk Gail. \u201cThey were very muscular. For constables.\u201d Meanwhile, Nick\u2019s stag was a barrel of laughs after he wrestled with the results of his latest brain scan. \u201cI can\u2019t control my emotions,\u201d he admitted to David. \u201cWhat happens if I walk down the aisle and I deck her?\u201d Nick tried his best to get out of the wedding, but Carla\u2019s powers of persuasion are strong. For someone whose default facial expression is \u201cI\u2019ve seen it all\u201d, you\u2019d think she\u2019d know better than to tie the knot next week, when Britain\u2019s Got Talent airs every night, pushing Corrie into post-watershed ratings-chasing territory. Going by past evidence, a fresh episode of Corrie each evening means that someone\u2019s bound to get killed/jilted/pushed under a tram at some point. Or, as that wise sage of the Street Sally said: \u201cIf this is the hen do, God help us on the wedding.\u201d     Brain of Britain\u2026 Cain, Holly and Charity. Photograph: Andrew Boyce    Meanwhile in Emmerdale, Cain was back to his evil best. Hood up and on the warpath, he set out to find out the identity of Belle Dingle\u2019s mystery older man. Sadly, his brain didn\u2019t match his brawn and poor Rakesh was on the receiving end of a case of mistaken identity. Well, if you\u2019re going to falsely imprison someone, why not make it a lawyer? \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a man who knows that being tied up in a shed all night is grounds for some serious suing,\u201d said the ever-helpful Charity. And how does Hollyoaks compete with the big guns of soap storylining? By carrying on being bonkers. Blushing bride Sienna gave her forbidden lust object Trevor the glad eye as she walked down the aisle with Ben; Cameron tried to drown Ste; and The Gloved Hand Killer\u2019s waters broke. Add a dash of Mercedes on the rampage and it\u2019s just another standard month in the sleepy \u2019Oaks suburb.",
