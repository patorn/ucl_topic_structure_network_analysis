  "body": "Could we be about to elect a one-man financial bubble as president of the United States of America?  Donald Trump released his second annual personal financial disclosure statement last week. It was the largest ever and \u201ctremendous\u201d, according to Trump. And it did indeed show that the Trump brand appears to be thriving, financially speaking.  But what remains unclear is whether this kind of financial wellbeing is a substantial, blue-chip prosperity, or whether it\u2019s of the frothy Groupon variety. Don\u2019t remember Groupon? Launched in 2008 as one of the first of the daily deals websites, Groupon rapidly became a darling of the startup universe. A cover star of Forbes magazine as \u201cthe fastest growing company ever\u201d Groupon\u2019s investors celebrated as revenues soared from $313m in 2010 to $1.6bn the following year. They also ignored the fact that its marketing expenses more than doubled to reach $768m in the same time frame; by 2012, marketing spending accounted for a whopping 48% of Groupon\u2019s total revenues.  Once Groupon went public, in late 2011, all of those figures were made public in SEC filings for investors to scrutinize, and they didn\u2019t like what they saw. Since going public, Groupon has continued to post growth in revenues and users, but its margins have remained anemic and the rare quarterly profit it has posted has only come as a result of an asset sale, and not because it is running its businesses at a profit. Hype met hard data and Groupon\u2019s bubble went pop. Could the same cycle be coming for Trump Inc? When Trump declared his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, his finances were already at the heart of his campaign. \u201cI\u2019m really rich,\u201d he said at the time of his announcement, noting that his wealth (and his success in business) qualified him to be president. How rich, precisely, remains a hotly debated topic. The candidate himself insists that he\u2019s worth at least $10bn. Deny that, and you risk being sued. But like Groupon before its IPO, Trump is only providing the public with some of the information that they\u2019d need to get a complete view of his finances, and to understand whether he\u2019s running them well and profitably or not. Because, as Groupon (and countless other bubble companies) remind us, a dollar in revenue or gross income does not equate to a dollar in profits or net (after tax and other expenses) income \u2013 much as Trump has tried to conflate the two in his own statements. Just consider Trump\u2019s own description of his disclosure filing with the Federal Election Commission, which, in true Trump style, he notes that he is proud to say is \u201cthe largest ever in the history of the FEC\u201d. On the one hand, the press release notes that it shows \u201ca tremendous cash flow and a revenue increase of approximately $190m\u201d. It then promptly states: \u201cThis income was utilized, among other things, for the funding of construction projects at various multi-million dollar developments, reduction of debt and the funding of the campaign.\u201d What we are seeing are gross revenues, as Shawn Tully at Fortune has pointed out in his own attempts to calculate Trump\u2019s net worth. There is a difference between cash flow and revenue, income or profits.  Essentially, for most presidential candidates, a personal financial disclosure (PFD) will capture their salaries, or investment income. In Trump\u2019s case, the numbers tell a different story. We simply don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s bottom line looks like yet. To do that, we\u2019d need to have a clear view of his costs \u2013 the equivalent of that giant marketing spending by Groupon.  For instance, he reported royalties of between $1m and $5m from sales of his most recent book, Crippled America, published in conjunction with his campaign. But how much has he himself spent to promote that book, costs that would reduce the net profit to him from the book\u2019s royalties? Have any of his companies bought copies of the book to distribute at rallies, thus boosting sales and royalties, but eating into the net benefit? (Neither would be uncommon practices, incidentally.) We\u2019d also need to understand his obligations: how much he owes to creditors. That, too, is hard to gauge, given the way that Trump presents both the asset value and the debt associated with at least some of the properties in which he has an interest, as Fortune\u2019s Tully has shown. Above all, we don\u2019t know what tax rate Trump is paying on whatever revenues he has told us he is generating from these assets. The assets may have grown in number over the last year, as the PFD shows; the revenue stream may have increased. But without knowing what tax rate he\u2019s paying and what his costs are, we don\u2019t know how good a job he\u2019s doing at what really matters: ending up breaking even or with a profit at the end of the day.  Trump has declared that what he pays in taxes is \u201cnone of your business\u201d. Voters, he said, don\u2019t have an automatic right to see his tax returns before making their decision in November. He added that he won\u2019t release them until an IRS audit, now under way, is complete, although the IRS has said he is free do so at any time. We, the voters, would be hiring Trump as the country\u2019s CEO and CFO. We want to be sure we\u2019d be hiring someone who would run not a bubble company like Groupon, but with at least as savvy an eye to the bottom line as some of the blue-chip companies in Trump\u2019s own investment portfolio: Alphabet (the former Google); Microsoft, AT&T, Procter & Gamble. The \u201ccompany\u201d that President Trump runs wouldn\u2019t need to be flashy or earn spectacular returns, but it would need to stay solvent and still be in business four or eight years from now.  We need to learn from the experiences of those early investors in Groupon, who bought shares in a company without digging into its financial statements. Trump\u2019s business enterprises may well be solid, but the SEC wouldn\u2019t let you or me invest in them based on the level of disclosure provided to us in the FEC\u2019s statements. So why should we end up \u201cowning\u201d a bubble president, just because we couldn\u2019t get adequate financial disclosure? Especially given that so much of Trump\u2019s campaign, and his appeal to voters, relies on his apparent prowess in business.  In the case of Groupon, at least, investors who bought shares in the IPO should have been well aware of the perils: the company\u2019s IPO prospectus contained more than 20 pages of risk factors. In making the decision whether or not to \u201cinvest\u201d in Trump, however, we need a lot more financial information than we\u2019ve got at present. Simply being \u201cthe largest\u201d financial disclosure on record doesn\u2019t make Trump\u2019s \u201cthe best\u201d. Alas, we can\u2019t get Trump to submit the equivalent of an IPO filing with the SEC, complete with the requisite investor warnings. That\u2019s unfortunate, as it might be the most appropriate way to get an insight into his finances. But we can and should demand that he do what every major presidential candidate for the last 40 years has done, and submit his tax return for public scrutiny, so that we can at least try to understand how he has managed his money. To Trump, this all seems to be about maximizing our perception of how much money he has. To the rest of us, it\u2019s about transparency on the part of an individual who aspires to govern the most powerful country on the planet. When someone aspires to that level of power and authority, they lose the right to say something so significant \u201cis none of your business\u201d.",
