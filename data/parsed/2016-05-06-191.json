  "body": "When Neil Warnock arrived at Rotherham United in February, they were in the relegation zone, three points from safety, and heading only one way. A couple of weeks later they were six adrift, only one point above Bolton Wanderers. Then Warnock got his feet under the table.   Related: Liverpool sink Yellow Submarines to reach Europa League final - Football Weekly Extra    Rotherham\u2019s defeat by Blackburn Rovers last weekend was their first since February, an 11-game unbeaten run that saw victories over Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough, plus a draw against play-off-bound Derby County, who spent more on players this season than Rotherham did on their entire stadium. Safety was confirmed with two games to spare but in retrospect it was nailed on as soon as Warnock walked through the door. Before joining Rotherham, Warnock thought he was done. After leaving Crystal Palace in December 2014, it looked as if his future was a pleasant life at home in Cornwall, with the odd media appearance and the occasional advisory gig to keep things ticking over. One of those came at Queens Park Rangers, who wanted Warnock to give Chris Ramsey a hand, but when Ramsey was sacked and Warnock took temporary charge, the \u201cglint in his eye\u201d returned. \u201cIt gave me a buzz, on the training ground,\u201d he says. \u201cI forgot how much I enjoyed it.\u201d Even then, after Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was appointed the new manager at Queens Park Rangers and Warnock\u2019s help no longer required, he did not expect to rock up at Rotherham. \u201cThey had asked before Christmas if I\u2019d help out, but I said no chance \u2013 it\u2019s too far. But then I went up there to watch them against QPR in January, and I just enjoyed it so much, when they asked me to help out, I said: \u2018Let\u2019s give it a go then.\u2019\u201d And give it a go he has. Warnock, with the help of his trusty sidekick Kevin Blackwell, has employed a very recognisable style of football: uncomplicated, organised, a bit of steel and priority given to, shall we say, getting the ball up front in quick-smart fashion. But off the pitch has been just as important, where the atmosphere has been lightened and the players are far more relaxed; most of the squad, when asked about Warnock\u2019s tenure, will refer to his positivity. Warnock and Claudio Ranieri might not be the most obvious kindred spirits but their respective successes this season have shown that keeping things light and positive on the training ground is a decent place to start for any manager. The Leicester comparison might be a little tenuous \u2013 Rotherham looked in trouble, but were not 5,000-1 to stay up \u2013 but there are other similarities. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive boost for everybody,\u201d Warnock says of Leicester\u2019s title win, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t be anywhere near the top half wages wise, and Rotherham will probably be the lowest next year, depending on who gets promotion. Nowadays, money isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all \u2013 Leicester have showed that. It\u2019s shrewd additions, a good recruitment policy and team spirit.\u201d Lee Frecklington, club captain and veteran of the back-to-back promotions that took Rotherham into the Championship, confirms: \u201cThe team spirit in the dressing room is the best I\u2019ve ever known here. I think even through the promotion years I\u2019ve never known a dressing room that was so happy to come to training every day. He [Warnock] creates a really positive environment when he comes into training, always with a smile on his face, always making sure he uses the word \u2018enjoy\u2019.\u201d     Rotherham\u2019s Lee Frecklington wins the last-minute penalty that earned a win over Leeds in April. He says Warnock \u2018creates a really positive environment when he comes into training\u2019. Photograph: ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock    The short-term nature of the project seems to have helped, too. When Warnock arrived he made it clear that he was there for 16 games and wanted to enjoy himself, telling the players in no uncertain terms that they should as well. \u201cHe said it was a 12-week project, we\u2019re going to give it everything we can and maybe we\u2019ll enjoy the ride along the way,\u201d says Frecklington. \u201cBecause it was only a short-term plan everyone\u2019s given everything they can for these 12 weeks, and that\u2019s turned out to be enough.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, most people there \u2013 the players included \u2013 thought we were down,\u201d says Warnock. \u201cBut right from day one we said: \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got a great chance if we stick together, and you listen to what we\u2019ve got to say.\u2019 We started on a run which has been fantastic. Someone\u2019s just rung me to say it\u2019s the best run Rotherham have had since 1959 at this level.\u201d Warnock has won promotion to the top flight three times (with Notts County, Sheffield United and QPR) and managed there with four different clubs, but he has never looked at home, always seeming slightly uncomfortable, resembling a boy forced into wearing a smart but uncomfortable suit when he would rather be out playing in the park, getting grubby. \u201cThe Championship\u2019s a difficult league, but I do enjoy the blood and guts \u2026 it\u2019s my cup of tea.\u201d Warnock represents one of the curious paradoxes of the Championship, a division in which many enjoy life but are essentially driven by a desire to get out of it. For most, promotion is a means to an end, a way of getting to the shiny riches and polished challenges of the Premier League, but you get the sense for Warnock that promotion itself is the prize, rather than what comes after it. He is like the gentleman thief, motivated not by the gold but the act of cracking the safe. Football\u2019s Thomas Crown, if you want to extend the metaphor to breaking point. Warnock has been promoted seven times in his career: nobody has managed eight, which is why one more season, with a promotion at the end before he finally does retire, would seem like the perfect way to go out. A big factor in this late-career resurgence seems to be his wife, Sharon, who gave him her blessing and even encouraged his return to the game, despite being diagnosed with breast cancer in December. \u201cI just think she wanted to get me out from under her feet really,\u201d Warnock says. Sharon\u2019s treatment is going well, to the extent that she wants him to continue next season. Where that will be, nobody yet knows. Warnock is relatively coy about where he will be in August, but he says it will be in the Championship and has already fielded several offers. He repeatedly stresses the importance of having a good chairman, which would probably rule out a fair few clubs. \u201cI\u2019ve been surprised, the people that have spoken to me,\u201d he says, although he has not discounted staying at Rotherham, talking about the club and chairman, Tony Stewart, with genuine warmth. \u201cIt\u2019s like in the old times,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a chairman here who\u2019s just let me manage, and I think he\u2019s enjoyed it. He\u2019s given me support when I\u2019ve needed it, and for me that\u2019s how football clubs should be.\u201d Stewart, Frecklington and seemingly most of Rotherham want him to stay, but he has promised to leave any announcement about his future until the season is over. \u201cIt\u2019d be fantastic,\u201d he says about bowing out with another promotion next season. \u201cNo disrespect to Rotherham, going up would be very difficult with them, but having said that, there\u2019s a lot to be said for contentment, and a working environment I enjoy. I\u2019ve got a lot to think about really.\u201d",
