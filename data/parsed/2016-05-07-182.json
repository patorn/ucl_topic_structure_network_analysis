  "body": "Our team leader criticises the firm in tweets even though clients may see them I work as part of a five-strong, close-knit design team for a large media/graphic design company. Globally, we have some well-known, high-profile clients. I suppose we live up to the image of \u201ccreative types\u201d with a good sense of humour and lots of banter. As part of what we do \u2013 essentially coming up with bright ideas \u2013 we have to bounce those ideas off one another and it is truly a joint effort. Any change in that dynamic would make our work virtually impossible. The problem is \u2026 our team leader. We regard him as management in that he sorts out rotas and is in charge. So we don\u2019t engage that personally with him. But he is very much part of the team when it comes to thinking up all those ideas. However, all we really know of his personal life is from social media. He details every tick and comma on Facebook and Twitter (although he has made it plain that going on to social media at work is a no-no). We know when he\u2019s been for a coffee, had the painters in, what the patio is looking like, how the grass is growing, if West Ham have scored and if the cat\u2019s had a funny turn. OK over a pint in the pub, but it\u2019s all getting too close to work for comfort. First we\u2019ve had the Twitter digs obviously aimed at us. There are comments about late trains from Brighton when one of us lives there. You get the idea. But now it\u2019s getting too close to the office. One tweet took issue with our \u201cPeople Services Team\u201d including a dig at their \u201cblue-sky thinking\u201d and signed \u201cDavid Brent\u201d.\u00a0 We fear some of our clients might be picking these up and that it could reflect very badly that a member of staff is dissing the company that they\u2019re hiring on lucrative contracts. To rub salt into our wounds, we see from the timing his tweets were sent in office hours. It\u2019s become so worrying we\u2019re on edge day to day wondering what\u2019s going to be tweeted next. But we just don\u2019t know how to approach it. Jeremy says I\u2019ve tried very hard to understand what you\u2019re worried about \u2013 and I\u2019ve failed. You say that \u201che\u2019s very much part of the team when it comes to thinking up those bright ideas\u201d so he doesn\u2019t seem to get in the way of your work and even seems to contribute. I agree he seems to be a depressingly dull individual, as is anyone who bothers to post the state of his patio on social media; but why are you all so addicted to his Twitter and Facebook effusions? You think that some of them are designed to be digs at you. They probably are \u2013 but the ones you quote are so sub-David Brent I can\u2019t imagine why it\u2019s all become so worrying. Why don\u2019t you just let him carry on getting some sort personal gratification from spewing up all over the internet; but deny him the gratification of reading any of it? With one exception. You worry that they may be seen by important clients. If they get more poisonous, forward them without comment to your management. It\u2019s a matter for them. Readers say  \u2022 The only real issue here is if he\u2019s slating the firm. You could PM him on Twitter and say you\u2019re bothered that it\u2019s making the firm look bad. That would probably remind him how visible it is. Apart from the stuff that threatens your firm\u2019s reputation, it\u2019s really none of your business. ID7800889 \u2022 Tell him like it is. \u201cOliver, you really need to put a lock on Twitter, because all our clients can read your tweets 24/7. Same applies to your settings at FB. Remarks have been made.\u201d All the rest, forget about. Aranzazu \u2022 The emphasis is the importance of the team dynamics. The subtext: you don\u2019t want to rock the boat. Basically, you want to change the situation but with minimal (zero?) interference in the team. This is clouding your decision to do the right thing, ie raise this discretely with a senior manager. It is their responsibility. starterforten \u2022 I\u2019d constantly bring up the contents of his Tweets \u2013 that his patio looks nice, ask how his coffee was \u2013 until he takes the hint. FatherChewyLouie My boss won\u2019t bend when it comes to my flexible working arrangement I work at a solicitors in central London but live in Bedfordshire. My commute is about an hour each way. We have two young children. I do the school run in the morning while my husband picks up in the afternoon. I negotiated a deal with work whereby I don\u2019t start until 10:15 and work until 6:15. However, the train service has become so unreliable I\u2019m often late \u2013 if it ran to time I\u2019d easily be on time. My boss lives just 20 minutes from the office and I don\u2019t think he believes my trains are quite as rubbish as they are. He\u2019s suggested I catch an earlier train, but then I couldn\u2019t take the children to school. My company claims to have a family friendly policy but I find myself under pressure from a child-free male to dump the children on someone else in order to catch a train 30 minutes earlier.  Jeremy says Is your boss genuinely inconvenienced or simply insisting on punctuality for its own sake? It makes a difference. By the sound of it, you originally negotiated an agreement not with your boss but with someone centrally \u2013 HR, perhaps \u2013 who represented the company \u201cfamily friendly policy\u201d. I suggest you enlist their help again. Ask if they can arrange for someone to cover your occasional brief absences in the morning so that your boss is never left without help. If your boss is simply being unreasonable, see if HR (or whoever) can help present your case not as a personal favour but as part of company policy. Readers say  \u2022 I\u2019m surprised that any company in central London doesn\u2019t have flexible working times with public transport being so unreliable. I\u2019d ask for proper flexible working, with leeway to have a shorter lunchbreak or work slightly longer to make up time. LBukem  \u2022 In fairness, your employer has demonstrated it\u2019s family friendly policy by allowing you a later start time. The train company failure is not your employer\u2019s problem. It is your responsibility to get to work at 10.15. RF1963 \u2022 I don\u2019t know what you can do with your boss, but you are not wrong to point to our ever more useless public transport. Tarantellad \u2022 Have an informal chat with HR, or which ever department you initially approached on the subject. If it doesn\u2019t bring about a solution take up the issue more forensically with your boss. Take a copy of everything that relates to your situation. Have a clear idea on what needs to change for you and the employer. Be ready to concede something \u2013 possibly a further amendment to your start time. ArmchairSupporter  \u2022 I like the emphasis on \u201cchild-free male\u201d. We aren\u2019t all ogres. Show him a diary of a week or two, showing timings per day of drop off, time at station, time of train, journey to London, train stations to work etc!! ID9457848 Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy\u2019s and readers\u2019 help, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com. Please note that he is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or to reply personally.",
