  "body": "Henry Ford said in 1919, \u201cA business that makes nothing but money is a poor kind of business\u201d. Rarely in the 100 or so years since have his words borne greater significance. The global community has embarked on a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in an effort to break down systemic barriers to sustainable development such as inequality, unsustainable consumption and production patterns, inadequate infrastructure and a lack of decent jobs. The price tag: between $3.4tn - $4.5tn (\u00a32.3tn - \u00a33tn) per year in state spending, investment and aid.  At the same time, the collective purchasing power of people at the base of the economic pyramid (BoP) now exceeds $5tn (\u00a33.4tn). This confluence of demand and opportunity offers unprecedented potential for the private sector to accomplish the SDGs.  An increasing number of businesses are seeing in inclusive business models the opportunity to marry bottom-line demands with the sustainable development agenda. And an increasing number of these businesses are being led by women.  Between January 2015 and January 2016, six new member companies of the Business Call to Action (BCtA) were owned by women \u2013 the largest number in a single year since the project was launched in 2008. Their reasons for capitalising on the unique opportunities \u2013 and challenges \u2013 of engaging low-income people as consumers, producers, suppliers, and distributors are as varied as their nationalities (six), their ages (31-45) and their businesses (sanitation, food processing, transportation, weather forecasting, coffee and shea butter production).

Photograph: Mozambikes    What they do share, however, is the belief that their businesses are capable of both making money and bringing real, substantive change to their customers, suppliers and employees. Phrases such as \u201cchanging communities for the better\u201d \u201csustainability\u201d, \u201csocial impact\u201d, \u201ceconomic parity\u201d, \u201cempowerment\u201d, and \u201caddressing poverty and hunger\u201d pepper explanations of why they\u2019ve structured their businesses for inclusion \u2013 on top of the already daunting work of ensuring financial success.  \u201cI am very passionate about for-profit solutions to poverty and development\u201d, explained Lauren Thomas, founder and CEO of Mozambikes, which has committed to improve the lives and livelihoods of 50,000 of Mozambique\u2019s poorest people through the sale of affordable branded bicycles by 2018. \u201cIt is important to me that Mozambikes provides long-term sustainable impact as a business instead of being structured as a donor-funded programme with an end date.\u201d Since its founding in 2010, the company has sold more than 7,000 bicycles, largely through its branded bikes channel. By 2020, annual sales are projected to reach 25,000 per year.  While the majority of these women entrepreneurs set out to run socially impactful companies, one business came upon it quite by accident. Ignitia, which delivers low-cost tropical weather forecasts via text messages to small-scale farmers in west Africa, started as a research project to see if it was possible to create a reliable forecasting model for addressing the unique challenges of the tropics. When the model proved successful, the research team found itself with numerous options.     Northern Ghana Shea has committed to expanding market access for 4,000 rural women who pick shea nuts and produce shea butter. Photograph: Jason Florio    \u201cAddressing the needs of the billions of poor people living at the base of the economic pyramid is often a forgotten opportunity. After some market research ... I could clearly see how the solution we created could help solve pervasive problems like poverty and hunger simply by offering access to reliable information,\u201d says Liisa Petrykowska, Ignitia\u2019s CEO. \u201cBeyond social impact, it turns out that the most weather-dependent business is agriculture \u2013 a market with about 2 billion small-scale farmers who make a living off rain-fed yields and play a key role in feeding the world\u2019s rapidly growing population.\u201d  Northern Ghana Shea (NGS) joined the BCtA in 2016 with a commitment to expand market access for 4,000 rural women who pick shea nuts and produce shea butter. They plan to do this while increasing the volume of these farmers\u2019 production by 60% and diversifying their customer base. According to Juliette Lampoh, Northern Ghana Shea\u2019s CEO, \u201cSocial impact does not just happen in a normal business setting. It takes a conscious effort to generate and it costs money and time to nurture.\u201d It might seem counter-intuitive that, as women business leaders, building gender-specific targets would not be high on their lists of objectives. The truth, however, is more nuanced. While NGS\u2019s mission is to create business opportunities for rural Ghanaian women, Mozambikes\u2019 team felt that skills development for women should be integrated into the business model. According to Ignitia\u2019s CEO, targets are important, but the anonymity of the product precludes any special focus. So the company invests its efforts in marketing to ensure equal access.      Equator Kenya is a food-processing company that produces African bird\u2019s eye chilies. Photograph: Equator Kenya    On the other side of the spectrum, neither Equator Kenya \u2013 a food-processing company that produces African bird\u2019s eye chilies, nor Banka BioLoo, which brings sustainable, affordable sanitation solutions to the BoP in India, have established specific gender-based targets. Almut van Casteren, Equator Kenya\u2019s CEO, notes that women\u2019s empowerment in the traditionally patriarchal communities of Kenya can cause friction, with husbands forcing their wives to quit their jobs. And while Banka BioLoo is gender neutral in terms of its customers, founder Namita Banka acknowledges that their product does favour women, who suffer the results of poor sanitation disproportionately to men in terms of loss of dignity and security.  Only Vava Coffee, which increases access to credit and training in financial management and sustainable agriculture for Kenyan coffee farmers, is stressing gender targets in its overall business plan.  \u201cWomen make up 80% of the labour force, so it is important they are properly integrated into the supply chain \u2013 especially in positions of leadership and influence,\u201d says Vava Angwenyi, the company\u2019s founder and chief \u201ccoffaholic\u201d. \u201cSo we have enforced this along our supply and value chain to ensure that women, who are extremely vital to the success of this industry, are given these roles and empowered more.\u201d But while gender-based targets are not necessarily important, all agree that mainstreaming inclusive business can be instrumental in advancing women\u2019s empowerment and equity. \u201cBy supporting women farmers in the form of training, inputs, asset loans and a guaranteed market, they are better prepared to meet market demands, especially in the export market,\u201d says Equator Kenya\u2019s van Casteren. \u201cHaving a proven track record for loans and repayments makes it easier for them to access financing from the bank. And these women are more independent from their husbands.\u201d As any entrepreneur will attest, owning and running a business is not easy. Does gender add a complicating dimension? And does being an inclusive business further complicate things? For some, yes. Vava Coffee\u2019s Angwenyi notes that hers is a male dominated industry and that banks \u201c\u2026 don\u2019t appreciate the inclusive business model yet.\u201d For Petrykowska and Thomas, there is the risk of not being taken seriously in male-dominated African societies. For Lampoh, however, this has not been an issue.  Interestingly, neither van Casteren nor Banka feel that being a woman business owner has been uniquely problematic. Moreover, both feel that the inclusive nature of their businesses has, in fact, been a boon. \u201cAs a woman business owner, I don\u2019t face any great challenge. Rather, I\u2019m able to put forth views that are generally not discussed,\u201d says Banka. \u201cI receive support within the economic forums to espouse the cause for women\u2019s welfare. The Indian economy is dominated by men, and making a mark as a woman is not easy. Nevertheless, I receive recognition for my contribution to sanitation.\u201d From this sampling of business leaders who have plunged headlong into the deep end of the business pool, it\u2019s clear that being an SME, being a woman and being an inclusive business offers unusual challenges and high risks. But in the end, all would agree with Lampoh in her assessment of long-term opportunities and how they can impact the new global agenda:  \u201cI\u2019m convinced inclusive business offers a win-win for business and development. I think there is opportunity for business growth operating in a developing sector, and everybody benefits from participating in the business. Thus there is reduced dependency, fewer poor people, and therefore more capable customers and suppliers.\u201d Content on this page is paid for and provided by Business Call to Action, sponsor of the business and the sustainable development goals hub",
