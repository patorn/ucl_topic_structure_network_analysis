Tests of four major brands of sunscreen found that, after six to eight hours, the effectiveness of SPF 30 lotions reduced by 74%, leaving the skin vulnerable to harmful ultraviolet rays. Which? looked at sunscreen made by Soltan, PizBuin, Reimann and UltraSun, which all claimed to offer at least eight hours of full protection. However, the study showed that, over time, SPF 30 protection could drop to as low as SPF8 if not reapplied.  In Australia, brands are not allowed to make \u2018once-a-day\u2019 claims, and anything that leads consumers to believe sunscreens do not need to be regularly reapplied is forbidden. Which? director of policy and campaigns Alex Neill warned that, with 100,000 people diagnosed with skin cancer in the UK each year, \u201csome manufacturers need to do more to ensure their sunscreens live up to the claims on the packaging\u201d. He said: \u201cOur testing shows that these sunscreens just don\u2019t live up to their \u2018once-a-day\u2019 claims so people should reapply sunscreens regularly to ensure they have protection from the sun.\u201d Cancer Research echoed his statement, and said its recommendation was always to \u201creapply regularly to help get even coverage of your skin\u201d. But Boots, the maker of Soltan, disputed Which?\u2019s findings and said its sun lotion offered the protection promised on the bottle.   \u201cIt is expected that the level of SPF in any \u2018once-a-day\u2019 sun protection will reduce throughout the day,\u201d a Boots spokesperson said.  \u201cThis is why we formulate Boots Soltan Once 8 Hour Sun Protection SPF30 to a higher level of SPF so that our customers can be confident it will not reduce below SPF 30, and they will get the right level of protection for a full eight hours.\u201d  Piz Buin said in a statement that its all-day protection sunscreens carried \u201cclear instructions\u201d on the need for reapplication, and contested Which?\u2019s recommendation that \u2018once-a-day\u2019 sunscreens should be banned.  The test was also called into question by the industry body, the Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association, which criticised the watchdog for testing the products on volunteers wearing shirts which may have rubbed off the protection. Dr Chris Flower said: \u201cWe normally apply sunscreen to areas of skin that will be exposed to the sun but we don\u2019t apply sunscreen to areas that will remain covered under clothes. Exposed areas will not be subject to rubbing against a T-shirt for six to eight hours, so we feel this is unrealistic as a test and believe the criticisms from Which? are not justified.\u201d This is not the first time the protection offered by sunscreen has been called into question. Research by Which? found that Soltan SPF30 and Hawaiin Tropic SPF30 sunscreens offered two-thirds of the skin protection they claimed.",
