  "body": "When a well-bred filly wins the Musidora Stakes by four lengths, the next chapter in her story normally writes itself. There is still the outside chance of a plot twist in the case of So Mi Dar, however, as her emphatic success here on Wednesday was the best single performance in any British Classic trial in 2016, a season when the very best three-year-old fillies could prove to be at last a match for the best of the colts.   Related: Gosden sets So Mi Dar on course for Oaks after Epsom Derby Trial win    In any normal year, So Mi Dar would head straight to the Oaks at Epsom on 3 June. But this is a spring with a new normal, when colts like Humphrey Bogart and Viren\u2019s Army, both of whom finished behind So Mi Dar in the Derby Trial at Epsom in April, go on to win Classic trials but do not hold Derby entries. It is also a year when even a victory as comprehensive as So Mi Dar\u2019s is not enough to promote her to the top of the Oaks betting. Minding, the 1,000 Guineas winner, remains favourite for the fillies\u2019 Classic at Epsom at a best price of 5-4, while So Mi Dar is 3-1 for what would be a compelling head to head. Then again, Minding is also 3-1 favourite \u201cwith a run\u201d for the Derby a day later, ahead of Midterm\u2019s run in the Dante here on Thursday. Should Midterm, top-priced at 100-30 for the Derby, fail to advertise his chance, what then? A further complication is that while the connections of horses like Viren\u2019s Army, the Dee Stakes winner, would need to scratch together \u00a375,000 for a supplementary entry, So Mi Dar has a free pass to the Derby thanks to her victory in the track\u2019s \u201cwin-and-you-are-in\u201d trial. Unless Midterm or one of his opponents spreadeagles the Dante field, John Gosden\u2019s filly would probably start as a solid second-favourite, at worst, for either of the Epsom Classics. The immediate reaction of both Gosden and Lady Lloyd Webber, whose husband, Andrew, owns So Mi Dar, was that So Mi Dar will go for the Oaks. \u201cI wish we could sell it [the free entry],\u201d Lloyd Webber said. \u201cWe could pass it on to one of those that has to supplement. \u201cBut why would you not want to win the Oaks, why would you give that up? And why would we be worried about one horse [Minding]? It\u2019s going to be a really strong Oaks field, probably stronger than the Derby, and we should take our chances, that\u2019s my feeling. \u201cIf we were having to supplement, we wouldn\u2019t be considering it, but we shouldn\u2019t be swayed by 75 grand. So that\u2019s what we must get out of our heads. Would we be supplementing for the Derby right now? Probably not. That says it all really.\u201d However, Lloyd Webber suggested Gosden would have the final say, while the trainer batted the Derby question back to the owner. The likelihood remains the Oaks will see a fascinating meeting between Minding and So Mi Dar but, as the connections of So Mi Dar in particular work through the options, there must be a chance, at least, the Derby will start to look like an interesting option. It is, above all, the Derby, the cornerstone of Thoroughbred racing for more than 200 years and a race that is, or should be, the ultimate prize for any owner of any Flat-bred horse. So Mi Dar\u2019s chance of success in the Derby, in receipt of 5lb from the colts, would also be as good, if not better, than her chance in the Oaks. If Paddy Power will indeed lay 6-1 with a run for the Derby, as their rep here suggested after the race, it is as obvious a bet to nothing as you will see all year. Nor is there the issue of stallion values to worry about. Were Minding to beat her male stable companions at Epsom, the market value of an entire generation of the Coolmore Stud\u2019s three-year-old colts would crash. For the Lloyd Webbers, the problem would not arise. \u201cShe could do no more than hands-and-heels by four,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cThe golden plan was to get a lead and settle her, and I didn\u2019t mind her sitting last as she\u2019s got a great turn of foot. \u201cIf we go to the Oaks, it will be a hell of a race with Minding, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m very clear in my mind that the best two-year-old I saw last year was Minding, and the best three-year-old this year is Minding. I think she is above the colts and the other fillies, and this is the only filly on the book that can give her a proper race.\u201d Frankie Dettori, So Mi Dar\u2019s jockey, was in irrepressible form all afternoon, completing a treble which also included Magical Memory\u2019s comfortable success in the Group Two Duke Of York Stakes. Charlie Hills\u2019s grey travelled strongly throughout the six-furlong race before easing ahead approaching the final furlong to win by half a length. He will run next in the Group One Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot, but a long-term plan is also hatching in Hills\u2019s mind to travel to Santa Anita in November for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Sprint. \u201cHe\u2019s a beautiful horse that\u2019s going from strength to strength and Frankie gets on really well with him,\u201d Hills said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of class and he\u2019s improving, and he\u2019ll obviously go to Ascot. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be quick enough for five furlongs, but the stiff six should suit him. \u201cWhat has to impress you is how he travels in his races. Frankie rang me last week and said the race this horse is tailor-made for is the sprint at Santa Anita, so let\u2019s hope he\u2019s right.\u201d",
