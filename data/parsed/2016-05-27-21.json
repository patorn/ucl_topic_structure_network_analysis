  "body": "Claressa Shields\u2019 four-year run at the summit of women\u2019s boxing continued on Friday at the world championships in Astana, Kazakhstan. The American middleweight lived up to her world No1 ranking in the 75kg division with a unanimous-decision win over second-seeded Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands to capture a second straight world title and extend a 48-bout winning streak. The victory lifted Shields\u2019 amateur record to 74-1 and sealed a third consecutive global title for the 21-year-old from Flint, Michigan. \u201cTo be a two-time world champion feels great,\u201d Shields told USA Boxing. \u201cI have never had these emotions before and it was definitely overwhelming. It made me feel so complete and happy in my heart. My confidence never goes away.\u201d Shields\u2019 road to gold in Astana began with a last-second TKO of Germany\u2019s Sarah Scheurich followed by unanimous-decision wins over Uzbekistan\u2019s Nafisakhon Askarova, Kazakhstan\u2019s Violleta Knyazeva, Chinese Taipei\u2019s Nien Chin Chen and Fontijn.     Shields\u2019 second straight world title makes her the prohibitive favorite to repeat as Olympic champion in Rio. Photograph: AIBA    \u201cThis world championships was different because I was coming in as the reigning world champion not just the Olympic gold medalist,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a standard to uphold and that was to dominate everyone.\u201d Shields\u2019 lone career defeat came at 2012 worlds against Great Britain\u2019s Savannah Marshall, who went on to win the title. Since then, the American captured gold as a 17-year-old at the London Olympics \u2013 the first Games to include women\u2019s boxing \u2013 and a world championship two years later. With Friday\u2019s win, Shields becomes the first American boxer of either gender to win consecutive world titles since Eric Griffin in 1991 and 1993 \u2013 and the first ever to win three combined Olympic or world titles. Shields, who also claimed the award for outstanding boxer of the tournament, was one of five American women to medal in Astana.  Shadasia Green, a former McDonald\u2019s All-American nominee who played basketball for Old Dominion, won silver in the heavyweight division after a points loss to Kazakhstan\u2019s Lazzat Kungeibayeva before a home crowd in Friday\u2019s final bout. Marlen Esparza (light flyweight), Christina Cruz (bantamweight) and Franchon Crews (light heavyweight) each won bronze after bowing in their semi-final fights.  Shields\u2019 focus now turns to the Rio Olympics, where a rematch with Fontijn could await in the final. \u201cBetween now and Rio I am going to just get better,\u201d she said. \u201cI am my biggest critic and I like to acknowledge my mistakes and fix them. I am in great shape and adding more tools to my arsenal so I can dominate in the Olympics again.\u201d",
