  "body": "Tucked away in its own canyon on Boggs mountain, Harbin Hot Springs was bucolic and blissful, with shimmering dry air. Stressed-looking city folk in black sunglasses unloaded European cars in the parking lot of the famously clothing-optional resort, eager to strip down and loll in the hot pools, the cold pools, or on the shady lawn; or maybe to attend an \u201cunconditional dance\u201d class, or a Watsu massage (a Harbin original, administered while afloat in a pool).  There were painted cabins and arcaded, two-story hotel buildings, a gazebo and a swooping wooden temple, and everyone speaking quietly \u2013 whispering, even. But that was a while ago. Late last summer, after years of drought, three calamitous wildfires raced through the hilly forest and ranch lands of southern Lake County in California, two hours from San Francisco and just north of the Napa Valley. The blazes devoured 170,623 acres and 2,078 structures \u2013 including the state\u2019s preeminent new age spiritual re-charging spot. Harbin\u2019s dozens of buildings burned to the ground.  Seven months later, Harbin\u2019s owners, managers and former residents are now wrestling with their tabula rasa, their blank slate, on which to imagine and build a new home.    I already expressed my rage, and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more, so I\u2019m just building things now  Julie Adams      \u201cI was angry and as sad as I can stand to be in this lifetime,\u201d remembers the tough and acerbic poet and artist Julie Adams, a managing director at Harbin. \u201cBut I already expressed my rage, and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more, so I\u2019m just building things now.\u201d     A firefighter walks below the scorched hillside and buildings at Harbin Hot Springs resort after a wildfire. Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP    Harbin and its geothermal hot springs have been patronized since the 1870s by a succession of health-conscious Victorians, family weekenders, sportsmen in training, and, during the past 50 years, a rainbow of hippies, dropouts, artists and spiritual seekers.  Since 1975, it\u2019s been a not-for-profit entity, owned and successfully operated by the Heart Consciousness Church (HCC), both creations of a Harvard-educated guru called Ishvara, now 83 and formerly Robert F Hartley. Harbin thrived as a magnet for not only new age adherents but for the San Francisco Bay Area at large as a place to unplug and relax. As the high-tech industries of Silicon Valley boomed, so did Harbin.  Teslas and Priuses became as common in Harbin\u2019s parking lots as Volkswagen vans used to be. Still, Harbin withheld internet access. Cellphones, alcohol, drugs and cameras were prohibited.  \u201cFreedom, freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom\u201d is the way Ishvara once explained Harbin\u2019s allure. \u201cDon\u2019t have to wear clothes, don\u2019t have to measure up to anybody else\u2019s expectations, and can decide what kinds of relationships we want to have with each other.\u201d     The Hot Pool at Harbin Hot Springs. The resort is famously clothing optional. Photograph: Luiza Leite/www.harbin.org     The resort hummed year-round, 24/7.  Ishvara and his community proudly fly the new age flag. \u201cNew age thought is universal, holistic and non-dualistic,\u201d he wrote in 2002, defending the term against its \u201cmushy\u201d connotations. \u201cWe\u2019re not a cult!\u201d Adams says, but a community with \u201cnot-necessarily common spiritual aims. Everyone\u2019s right and nobody\u2019s wrong \u2013 unless they have a gun and want you to believe what they believe, in which case they should go somewhere else.\u201d According to Harbin press representative Eric Richardson, a normal, pre-fire Harbin weekend saw 600 guests with up to 1,000 on holidays. Rates were reasonable. Guests were required to sign in as members of HCC for a $10 membership fee.      Harbin, circa 1925. Photograph: www.harbin.org    On a recent visit to Harbin\u2019s burned-out campus, the view is dominated by a bristly shag of blackened forest trees overlaying the high, tawny mountain ridges all around. Harbin itself, now cleared down to its foundations, is nothing but a series of terraced voids and weedy lawns between pavements, spreading along both banks of the canyon\u2019s creek a half mile or so. The remaining stumps of big old shade trees killed in the fire are everywhere. In the middle of the desolation, a colorful mosaic mandala clings to a crumbling wall above a circular labyrinth outlined in river rocks.  The relatively intact pool complex dates back at least 140 years. Layers of concrete decking, retaining walls, and four pools spread outward from a rocky cleft in the hillside, where the springs are.  Seven different springs emerge there: a hot sulphur spring, a hot iron spring, four cold soda springs, and a warm arsenic spring that puddles in a little foot bath carved into the rock. It helps with athlete\u2019s foot, Richardson says.      Rebuilding the resort will happen in phases. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cWater becomes a deity of some kind,\u201d Adams observes, explaining how Harbin\u2019s springs have been sacred since humans first settled in Lake County thousands of years ago. \u201cI think that happens relatively quickly for things people need most, like warm water. It becomes their god.\u201d  Rebuilding the resort will happen in phases, Richardson reports. \u201cFirst, we\u2019ll reopen the pools and some campsites, offer limited massage and yoga, maybe do some outdoor movies or music,\u201d he says.  Adams expects the rebuild can be done by 2018.  \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the juiciest opportunity we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d says the project\u2019s lead design architect David Goldberg, president of Seattle-based firm Mithun. In January, Harbin\u2019s management team, residents and the Mithun architects held a series of day-long brainstorming sessions.  A Harbin memo called Key Points: Purpose of the Master Plan lists several bullet-point directives such as \u201crespect the earth\u201d, \u201cfacilitate connection\u201d and \u201ccreate a place of beauty and inspiration\u201d.  Another prescription commands, \u201cKeep the quirk\u201d, so I ask Adams what that means.      The Domes at Harbin Hot Springs. Photograph: Luiza Leite/www.harbin.org     \u201cIt\u2019s the way I do things,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI like accidents \u2026 and jokes. I love it when you come around a corner and there\u2019s an altar where you don\u2019t expect to find one. Those unusual, unexpected experiences that cause you to stop for just a minute \u2026 and look.\u201d  Adams, 71, calls herself the \u201cqueen of esthetics\u201d at Harbin, after years spent decorating Harbin rooms and public spaces with booty from 30 years of travel. She loves the arts and crafts movement of the late 19th century, designer William Morris (\u201cthe wallpaper guy\u201d), and prolific, early 20th-century California architect Julia Morgan.   Adams knows what she doesn\u2019t want at Harbin. \u201cIt would be unbearable to me for it to become steel and glass,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be noisy \u2013 it has to stay quiet so you can always hear the waters.\u201d  \u201cWood, stone and some glass,\u201d she says summarily, mentioning a tantalizing vision of the hotel buildings \u201ctucked into the hillsides that\u2019ll kind of look like Mesa Verde does\u201d.  She talks about all the artists among Harbin\u2019s former residents, and how she wants to enlist them to design elements for the new Harbin. She has salvaged materials that she wants to reuse. The mosaic mandala? \u201cThat stays the way it is,\u201d she says.      A Harbin wedding in the warm pool in 2001. Photograph: Tracy Stormy Edwards     This article was amended on 6 June 2016.
