  "body": "The presenters of BBC2\u2019s Springwatch have warned that wildlife programmes are failing to reflect the reality of the natural world. Chris Packham said there was a danger that nature reserves such as the RSPB\u2019s Minsmere in Suffolk, where the new series of Springwatch is based, \u201cbecome a bit like art galleries or museums where we go to get our fix\u201d when much of the countryside is \u201clargely sterile, too intensively farmed and with very poor biodiversity\u201d. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t generate the expectation that wildlife can only be found on nature reserves and I do think we as naturalists are guilty of this,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a consequence, we don\u2019t see the countryside as a place to access wildlife and that\u2019s a big problem because nature reserves occupy less than 2% of the UK\u2019s land surface.  \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset thing. Nature reserves are great but, whilst you are driving there, you should have the expectation of seeing wildlife too, not just dead pheasants on the side of the road.\u201d The long-running BBC2 show, which returns on Monday 30 May, will encourage viewers to \u201cdo something great for nature\u201d. But Packham\u2019s co-presenter, Martin Hughes-Games, said half a century of natural history programmes did not appear to have had the effect of getting more people interested in conservation or saving species from going extinct. \u201cI become increasingly concerned that \u2013 not Springwatch so much \u2013 but the more spectacular blue chip series that suggest there is this wonderful utopian world of wildlife out there that has no human interference at all. I fear those beautiful seductive programmes are not balanced by a clearer idea of what is going on and the loss of habitat,\u201d said Hughes-Games. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a drug. We love it and we come back and we lose ourselves in the beauty of these places, not realising that the habitats they are being filmed in are getting tinier and tinier. We don\u2019t reflect that.\u201d Packham said he would not be intimidated by the Countryside Alliance, which called on the BBC to sack him after he criticised leading conservation groups for sitting on the fence over foxhunting, badger culling and the plight of hen harriers. The presenter said he drew a line between the content of the BBC2 programme and what he said on other platforms. He also writes a column for BBC Wildlife magazine. \u201cMy campaigning is separate from the BBC, for obvious reasons,\u201d said Packham. \u201cOne of the things I most forthrightly champion is the BBC\u2019s independence and impartiality and I wouldn\u2019t want to compromise that in any way. \u201cI base my personal campaigning on a basis of good solid science so I am not driven emotionally. I am driven by what the evidence says at the time and with that foundation comes confidence that those of us who take that stance are right, so obviously we are not easily intimidated.\u201d The new series, which will run for three weeks, hopes to take cameras inside a weasel\u2019s nest for the first time.  The programme will feature golden eagles in Scotland and follow in close-up the travails of a little owl and its three eggs. It will also look at how the unseasonably warm spring has affected wildlife across the UK. In an echo of the \u201cDelia effect\u201d, when sales of ingredients soar after being featured by Delia Smith, the RSPB said sales of nest boxes with in-built cameras grew 50% as a result of their use on Springwatch. It will be the third time Springwatch has been based in Minsmere. Last year, a stickleback fish called Spineless Si became the unlikely star of the show. Some critics suggested the show went too far in giving some of the animals names, but the show\u2019s third co-presenter, Michaela Strachan, begged to differ. \u201cIf we gave every animal a name it would go too far; we only pick certain ones,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t remember the blue tits we didn\u2019t give a name to, but they remember Runty; they remember Sophia La Wren.  \u201cLast year it was Spineless Si. Nobody knew that putting a camera in a muddy bit of river would generate such a fantastic story. That\u2019s what I really look forward to. He was the underdog and he didn\u2019t look terribly interesting, and then he was the winner.\u201d",
