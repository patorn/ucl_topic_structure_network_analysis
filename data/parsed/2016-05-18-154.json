  "body": "When the main characters of a book are ghosts, you know anything can happen. A young girl named Winnie has five beloved animals who died and became spirits. She\u2019s the only one who can see them. You might wonder why \u2013 well, that\u2019s part of the plot and it gets revealed at the end.  If you think this book sounds cuddly and happy, you might want to reconsider that idea! It actually made my legs shake because I got really scared and anxious. I was so curious about what would happen next that I read it very quickly.  If you like mysteries and adventures, this book is definitely for you. There is of course a circus, a short search for a ruby and a long quest to reunite a ghost tiger with his old master.
