  "body": "Related: Royal TV: the dilemma of getting access to the Windsors    Inside a Portakabin near St Albans, Prince Harry and Pippa Middleton are making an exclusive royal announcement. \u201cWe\u2019re shagging,\u201d grins Pippa. \u201cOpenly,\u201d smiles Harry. \u201cNot in public, though!\u201d Pippa clarifies. \u201cNo, it\u2019s more your classic bed job,\u201d chimes in Harry. \u201cAlthough there was that one incident with her knees: lacerated, they were\u2026\u201d This is the kind of conversation you find yourself listening to behind the scenes of Channel 4\u2019s new six-part series The Windsors. It\u2019s a spoof sitcom that turns the lives of our monarchical overlords into a Dallas-esque soap, with the help of a heftily talented ensemble cast (Harry Enfield as Prince Charles, Morgana Robinson as Pippa Middleton, W1A\u2019s dim work experience lad Hugh Skinner as Prince William). It\u2019s written by the team behind mid-00s sleb-parodying comedy series Star Stories. And it\u2019s not exactly the most reverential treatment that the royal family\u2019s ever had.            The rehearsal I\u2019m watching as I wander on to the Hertfordshire set features Prince Harry (played by Richard Goulding: JP\u2019s brother Tomothy in Fresh Meat) attempting to marry the daughter of the Aussie prime minister, in a bid to get over his ill-advised attraction to Pippa. The Windsor family are standing in the Australian embassy, a comically shoddy wood-panelled affair, alongside an antipodean contingent dressed as if they\u2019re attending a 1980s prom (leopardskin shirts, satin bow ties, jackets so loud they deserve an asbo). The bride-to-be\u2019s choice of headwear is a white hat with dangling corks. The priest also has an alternative way of addressing Prince William\u2019s younger brother: \u201cHenry Charles Albert David Windsor,\u201d he pronounces, \u201cknown as Shagger, Spliff Head, E Monster, Ginge Minge, Hair Pie Nosher, Adolf, Shit For Brains.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about time someone had another pop at the royals,\u201d says co-writer Bert Tyler-Moore. Presumably he means as a counterpoint to the fawning column inches lavished upon the monarchy? \u201cActually, it\u2019s more that there are so many things like Peter Morgan\u2019s The Queen, which feel like PR exercises. We wanted to bring a different flavour. Not with any agenda \u2013 we just thought: \u2018This\u2019ll be a funny idea.\u2019\u201d     Harry Enfield as Prince Charles.    Given that the royals have been recast as national darlings since William and Kate started breeding, this seems a bold move. It\u2019s a reminder that this isn\u2019t the 1980s, when the royals\u2019 popularity was so low that Spitting Image could savage them with impunity. Surely they have to be fairly sensitive about how far they go, particularly, as on Star Stories, Tyler-Moore and writing partner George Jeffrie caused a kerfuffle after alluding to Princess Diana\u2019s fatal crash. \u201cActually, we would\u2019ve included Princess Di in this show. We just couldn\u2019t think of anything funny enough,\u201d smiles Jeffrie. Frankly, I find this hard to believe.   Related: The enduring social shorthand of Harry Enfield characters    As rehearsals go on, the show starts to make a little more sense. Louise Ford, who plays Kate Middleton, explains how her character is recast as a \u201cGypsy\u201d thanks to the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s supposed normality (at least compared to the rest of the royals). Meanwhile, Camilla is reimagined as a scheming villain determined to usher in the Parker-Bowles dynasty. It\u2019s the kind of ridiculous fictionalisation of public figures that has a rich comedy tradition in Britain (The Comic Strip, Stella Street and, of course, Star Stories). And it\u2019s had a mini-resurgence in recent years, with BBC3\u2019s warped gameshow Murder In Successville and Channel 4\u2019s structured-reality comedy Lookalikes, while original trailblazers The Comic Strip Presents\u2026 returned earlier this year with the phone-hacking scandal spoof Red Top. But, most notably, it means that a show that\u2019s mocking the royals is not really mocking the royals at all \u2013 it\u2019s mocking the media\u2019s portrayal of them.     Haydn Gwynne as Camilla Parker-Bowles    \u201cYeah, it takes [the royal family\u2019s] public personas and takes an angle on those,\u201d offers Ford. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t need to worry about it feeling bullying or insulting.\u201d Does it also mean that the cast didn\u2019t need to worry about in-depth research for their roles? \u201cYeah, Harry only really has three characteristics in our show,\u201d offers Goulding. \u201cOne: he\u2019s a bit stupid. Two: he enjoys drink and parties. Three\u2026 actually, that\u2019s probably it.\u201d For Robinson, who has to play Pippa Middleton \u2013 a woman whose personality plays second fiddle to her buttocks in the public imagination \u2013 the lack of realism doesn\u2019t strike a bum note. \u201cIf this was a drama rather than a comedy, I\u2019d never have been cast,\u201d grins the impressionist. \u201cNot with the size of this arse.\u201d Real-life monarchy aside, it soon becomes obvious that there\u2019s a king on set: Harry Enfield. His take on Prince Charles is a tour de force of deep-throated poshness. His co-stars flock around him, giggling fannishly at his quips. \u201cWhen we\u2019re filming, my inner monologue is just going: \u2018Don\u2019t look at Harry Enfield, don\u2019t look at Harry Enfield,\u2019\u201d Goulding admits. \u201cHe\u2019s so funny, I just crack up.\u201d     Prince William (Hugh Skinner) and Kate Middleton (Louise Ford)    Eyes appropriately averted from Enfield, the cast rehearse the wedding. Prince Harry proves unable to go through with the nuptials, and in a tender vignette tells his jilted bride he\u2019ll \u201calways have those [naked] pictures you texted\u201d. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll always have your dick pics!\u201d she replies before, naturally, holding up a photo of\u2026 wait a minute. Are they actually planning to show a snap of someone\u2019s testicles masquerading as Harry\u2019s danglies? \u201cWe asked extras to take photos of their balls,\u201d reveals The Windsors\u2019 producer Izzy Mant. \u201cWe had a whole meeting to decide whose testicles were ginger enough to be Harry\u2019s.\u201d High-brow humour this is not. But, despite a number of cast and crew comparing the show to Spitting Image, The Windsors doesn\u2019t feel like satire: more a comic drama that makes the odd comment about monarchy.     Beatrice (Celeste Dring), Harry (Richard Goulding) and Eugenie (Ellie White)    \u201cThe thing about Spitting Image is that it was a sketch show. It could be entirely spiteful,\u201d says Jeffrie. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a whole half-hour plot line \u2013 we\u2019ve had to include a lot of warmth for the characters.\u201d A serial format isn\u2019t the only reason for trying to render the royals warmly, though? For all Jeffrie and Tyler-Moore\u2019s earlier protestations that they could have included Diana if they\u2019d wanted, there must have been some part of them that was conscious not to strike the wrong note? \u201cWell, I suppose we did try to focus on the characters that were a bit\u2026 twatty,\u201d admits Jeffrie. \u201cUltimately, if you take the piss to the extent that it makes the viewer go \u2018Oh God!\u2019, it can stop it being funny.\u201d As I prepare to leave, the cast are still talking excitedly. Robinson offers that \u201cthis is more Heat magazine than Private Eye\u201d (no kidding). Goulding exclaims, \u201cHopefully no one will get sued!\u201d (seems unlikely). And Skinner is telling people: \u201cBasically I try to play a bad version of Matt Damon\u201d (huh?). Which is all very well, but will the royals actually watch this? \u201cActually,\u201d chips in Ford. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s high-class enough for them.\u201d She may have a point The Windsors begins tonight, 10pm, Channel 4",
