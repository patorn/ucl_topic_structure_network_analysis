  "body": "Ben Elton has written a new sitcom and it\u2019s funny. Let\u2019s start from there, because with a writing career like Elton\u2019s \u2013 bejewelled with brilliance and, more recently, besmirched with ignominy \u2013 there is no point looking back. I try not to think of Blackadder because for a writer to return to historical sitcom when the last one he wrote was basically perfect is a brave thing indeed. Upstart Crow (BBC2) is a knockabout, well-researched take on the working and domestic life of Shakespeare, which fudges his timeline to allow scenes in both Stratford-upon-Avon with his family, and with his theatrical muckers in London. It begins with animated monochrome drawings of yore which in no way make me think of Blackadder\u2019s closing titles because we are looking forward. We find Will (David Mitchell) running Juliet\u2019s lines from the balcony scene with his huffy teenage daughter Susanna, played by Raised by Wolves\u2019 superb Helen Monks. It becomes quickly obvious Elton is going to mix the expected forsooth-ing with liberal dollops of \u201cDon\u2019t go there\u201d and \u201cOh my God\u201d. Mitchell\u2019s Shakespeare is a flowery show-off who always uses 10 words when one would do. His more grounded Midlands family roll their eyes at his refusal to take the shortest verbal route in any conversation. Susanna tells her dad that his dialogue is \u201ca bit weird\u201d and her mother, Anne (Liza Tarbuck), snipes at her mother-in-law: \u201cYou think you\u2019re so posh, Mary Arden. Like you aren\u2019t sewn into your winter knickers like everybody else.\u201d The script is full of this historical detail, taken from what is known about Shakespeare\u2019s family life and the lives of ordinary folk back in 16th-century England. Elton really wants to show us that not only has he bothered to cram his script with jokes \u2013 imagine, actual jokes in a sitcom! \u2013 he has also based them on truth, historical or just plain human. Sometimes he trumpets this a bit too loudly, but it is episode one and he\u2019s making his point. The only time the noise from his observations becomes too loud, is on the entrance of Shakespeare\u2019s favourite clown Will Kempe, played by Spencer Jones, himself an accomplished comedy performer. Elton has noticed that Kempe, a famous comedian who received great acclaim abroad and who has become consequently smug, is a bit like Ricky Gervais, now enjoying star status in America. But instead of letting the comparison hang there, he has Jones deliver all of his lines as David Brent, aping the exact intonation and facial gymnastics. It\u2019s the only discord in an otherwise entirely fit-for-purpose comic creation. Laughs continue as Will tries to come up with an ending for Romeo and Juliet. When a posh youth is foisted upon his household by Master Green, master of the Queen\u2019s revels (Mark Heap, bellowing, roaring and generally channelling Stephen Fry), Will must keep the oik, Florian, from marrying unsuitably until he begins his studies at Cambridge. Elton has masses of fun here, unleashing his disdain for moneyed posh boys who roger dead farm animals as a rite of passage and fall into high-powered jobs by dint of their birth. And Mitchell delivers it all effectively with his trademark neutered rage. When Shakespeare, arriving in London, bemoans his transport woes and the state of the Queen\u2019s highway, Mitchell could be delivering one of his own monologues about the state of the country. It marries him perfectly to the part and sets his character against the world, essential for any sitcom antihero. The unfortunate Florian kills himself after a misunderstanding, as Elton nicks the end of Romeo and Juliet for his own purposes before giving it back to Shakespeare, the character, who continues to ponder the ending of his new play. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just say \u2018nose\u2019?\u201d asks his wife, when he comes up with some insufferably baroque prose to indicate that he has a cold. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d he returns. When the entire Shakespeare family, including his father, John (Harry Enfield), and mother, Mary (Paula Wilcox), misunderstand the meaning of \u201cwherefore\u201d in Juliet\u2019s balcony speech, Elton builds from this often-made joke (does she mean \u201cwhere\u201d or \u201cwho\u201d?) into a superb punchline about a cat. \u201cIf you do your research, my stuff is actually really funny,\u201d says Will. Even if your knowledge of Elizabethan domesticity is scant, Elton\u2019s new family sitcom is a return to jokes and I welcome that with ye knobs on.",
