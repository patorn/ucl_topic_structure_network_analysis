  "body": "A cross-party group of peers leading a campaign to halt controversial government cuts to the BBC and backed by Richard Wilson, Ross Kemp, and June Sarpong has said it will take to the streets in protest if its concerns are not met. Former Tory party chairman Norman Fowler, Labour peer Waheed Alli and the Lib Dems\u2019 Anthony Lester said the BBC\u2019s funding, independence and core mission to inform, educate and entertain had to be preserved in the government\u2019s white paper on its future, expected to be published on Thursday. A private member\u2019s bill will be laid down in the House of Lords next month challenging what are expected to be key tenets of John Whittingdale\u2019s plans for the BBC.   Related: BBC may have to share licence fee with rivals    In a press conference launching the bill, Lord Lester said: \u201cIf the government gives way on these issues I will withdraw the bill. If the government doesn\u2019t do it, my goodness me, not only are we going to back the bill but we will march, so there we are.\u201d Wilson, the former star of BBC1\u2019s One Foot in the Grave, said: \u201cI would march in the streets, I would, as long as they don\u2019t march too far.\u201d  There is mounting concern that the future of the BBC will not be debated by parliament, with peers on Monday arguing that it should not rest on the whim of the government. Following reports over the weekend about the plans, the shadow culture secretary, Maria Eagle, accused the culture secretary of being \u201cdetermined to diminish the BBC\u201d. Lord Fowler said: \u201cThe government should put its proposals to parliamentary debate and vote. The worst aspect of the [BBC\u2019s] royal charter is that it puts all the power in the hands of whatever government happens to be in power. This bill would provide a check on government power and the hope must be even without this bill the government would agree to putting its proposals to parliament so they can not only be debated but put to the vote.\u201d   Related: The BBC deserves better than a chump\u2019s charter    Wilson said: \u201cI hope the government will be forced into one of their many U-turns \u2013 they are very good at them these days. I don\u2019t think they realise how strong the public feeling is for the BBC.\u201dAsked about reports that the white paper would force the BBC to publish salary details of its biggest paid stars, Wilson said: \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t worry me. The press want to know what people make [but] it\u2019s not so much the press that we\u2019re worried about but it\u2019s fellow actors. There is a fear that if he\u2019s getting that much, why am I not getting it? In the theatre it\u2019s much healthier because everyone is on the same wage.\u201d The three peers opposed proposals to put a majority of government nominees on a new BBC board, and suggestions that the licence fee would be top-sliced to fund genres such as children\u2019s programmes on other broadcasters. Lord Alli said Whittingdale was also wrong to criticise BBC entertainment shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and the scheduling of news and entertainment shows against its commercial rivals. \u201cThe trouble with the culture secretary is he thinks the public is having too much fun,\u201d said Alli, a former TV producer who made Channel 4\u2019s Big Breakfast. \u201cWhenever politicians see us having fun they want to stop it. I can\u2019t account for it. I love the fact the BBC brings us together to laugh and cry and, in my case, bake.\u201d Lester said reported proposals to insert a break clause in the BBC\u2019s funding would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on its journalism and hamper long term planning.  Sarpong said: \u201cI think we need John Whittingdale to start being bombarded with lots of emails and people demanding that he protect the BBC. I think he\u2019d listen to that. All you need is for somebody to say okay, that\u2019s it, Strictly [Come Dancing] is at risk or The Archers is at risk, and that will mobilise people straight away, programmes that are ongoing and that are part of people\u2019s everyday lives.\u201dEastEnders star Kemp said: \u201cThe notion that politicians are going to interfere in the scheduling of what is one of the greatest British institutions and respected around the world is just ludicrous. They have no place to be involved in it and it would destroy any notion of it being independent.  \u201cThe government is underestimating the passion that people feel about the BBC. I don\u2019t think the public are aware presently of the implications of the white paper if it has in it what we have been led to believe. I think a lot of people [will march]. I\u2019m not going to forget where I came from.\u201d Eagle, spearheading the Labour party\u2019s opposition\u2019s to Whittingdale\u2019s plans, said: \u201cProposals to further top-slice the licence fee and pack a new governing board with Tory appointees would be a real hammer-blow to the independence of the BBC, and be more evidence of mendacious meddling on the part of the secretary of state. Labour will oppose them all the way. The culture secretary must stop ignoring the wishes of the public, who are clear that they want the BBC to remain independent and to carry on producing the programmes we all enjoy.\u201d",
