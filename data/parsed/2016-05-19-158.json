Look at the resentment directed at Punk London, in which \u201csome of the coolest cultural organisations and businesses in London celebrate punk in all its ragged glory\u201d. Is that punk? It\u2019s a relief, then, to encounter an actual punk veteran, someone who really was there \u2013 albeit in a very junior capacity \u2013 and who reacts to mention of the Pistols and the King\u2019s Road not with well-worn complaints about commercialisation, but with unalloyed enthusiasm. \u201cPunk was great. It changed everything for me,\u201d says 51-year-old Mark Moore. A master DJ, remixer and one of many fathers of the 1980s British house music explosion, his 1988 No 1 Theme from S\u2019Express \u2013 a Day-Glo powerhouse of a record that can still fill a dancefloor 28 years on \u2013 accelerated disco\u2019s long march back to mainstream popularity. \u201cI never saw punk as this nihilistic, negative thing,\u201d Moore says. \u201cI got into it because, as a teenager, I hated everything and I honestly thought I\u2019d be dead by 21 \u2013 like you do.\u201d He starts laughing; Moore laughs a lot. \u201cBut when Johnny Lydon sang \u2018No future\u2019, I truly felt that he was talking to me personally, giving me the message. \u2018There is no future for you \u2013 unless you do something about it.\u2019 It was so incredibly exciting and I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\u201d         The tune that started it all: Theme from S\u2019Express.    From the acid pop days of S\u2019Express to his DJing at contemporary gay alternative nights such as Horse Meat Disco and his own Private Life events in east London, Moore\u2019s 30-year career is evidence that loved-up, hands-in-the-air dance music is not punk\u2019s antithesis, but rather its continuation by alternative means. He continues the connection this month with an S\u2019Express remix album, Enjoy This Trip, the cover art of which pays homage to Linder Sterling\u2019s punk-era cut-up feminist artwork for the Buzzcocks: it depicts a topless model with a disco mirrorball for a head and smiley faces covering her nipples. Rather than handing over the tapes to stadium house DJs, Moore enlisted a group of like-minded souls to retool S\u2019Express\u2019s music for the 21st century. This includes east London electro urchins Punks Jump Up and Chris & Cosey of notorious art terrorists Throbbing Gristle, who transform Lollypop into a sordid piece of bump\u2019n\u2019grind disco. The hands of music\u2019s clock once more wind round to the primal chug and throb of sleazy electronics, and suddenly S\u2019Express are in tune with the times again.     Moore had a short but enjoyable period as a pop star in the late 80s. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock    We\u2019re talking in Moore\u2019s tastefully uncluttered house in east London. There are kitsch coffee mugs, groaning record shelves in the upstairs DJ room and a sizeable collection of Moore\u2019s other obsession, board games. (At one of his recent game nights, Moore learned that the designer Pam Hogg has a talent for ruthless politics when she assassinated all the other players in the game Coup.) He moved here to be closer to the fashionable Dalston neighbourhood, with its reservoir of youthful inspiration and innovative gay clubs such as The Glory. \u201cI lived in Maida Vale for a long time, but it stopped being about Sid Vicious and hippies keeping goats on their balconies and became about boring bankers,\u201d he says. When I tell him that Aphex Twin used to live a few doors up the road, he\u2019s absolutely delighted. Music\u2019s avant-garde fringes tend to attract those who\u2019ve elected to be outsiders; Moore had no choice in the matter. Born in 1965, he was the son of a first-generation Korean immigrant mother, \u201cone of the first to come over after the civil war\u201d, and her second husband, an English lawyer. His mother founded a successful property business and was named businesswoman of the year by the London Evening Standard. However, after she divorced Mark\u2019s father, it all fell apart. \u201cShe was trying to bring up two kids on her own and it got too much for her,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter some bad advice, she declared bankruptcy and kind of lost everything. She had a breakdown.\u201d Thus, when Moore was 10, he and his brother Joseph were decanted from a comfortable middle-class existence into a children\u2019s home he characterises as a \u201chalfway house for borstal kids\u201d. Entranced by his brother\u2019s collection of punk records, the teenaged Moore mooched around the King\u2019s Road with his friends, staring at the punk clothes they couldn\u2019t afford to buy. \u201cWe were so bored; there was absolutely nothing to do,\u201d he says, as if boredom itself were exciting. On occasion, they\u2019d knock on John Lydon or Sid Vicious\u2019s front doors just to see if they were in. To their disbelief, Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen, befuddled by heroin, once let them in for tea. \u201cSid was adorable, really docile. We thought they must have had a late night the night before: \u2018Why are they so sleepy?\u2019 We were about 14 \u2013 we didn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d Spungen gave them bondage trousers and Vivienne Westwood tops to take away. Moore still has the trousers somewhere. \u201cPeople come round and try them on now and again. Bobby Gillespie had a go. Like an idiot, I washed them after I got them.\u201d         Hey Music Lover by S\u2019Express.    In time, Moore and his fellow misfits moved into the squats that then dotted London. Black US dance music had been anathema to the more doctrinaire punks, but Moore remembers coming out of the disco closet to his fellow squatters by playing them Funkytown by Lipps Inc. \u201cI love this and I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t,\u201d he declared. His squatmates were relieved to finally admit that yes, they loved it, too. \u201cDisco had been verboten before, but now something was happening,\u201d Moore says. As for the other closet, he emerged from that much earlier. \u201cI think you always know deep down when you\u2019re gay,\u201d he says. \u201cAt school, I\u2019d gone out with girls, but really you\u2019re thinking about guys.\u201d It was an open-minded time, he says. \u201cYou had straight guys who went down the Dilly [Piccadilly] and sold their arses. When we started clubbing, going to Steve Strange\u2019s club Billy\u2019s and The Blitz, it became even less important whether you were gay or straight. Quite blokey boys were into Spandau Ballet. A lot of them were quite straight and a lot of them were screaming queens. It didn\u2019t really matter.\u201d The first time that Moore tried DJing, at a college party, he was so naive that he lugged his entire record collection with him. \u201cIt weighed a tonne, but I remember sending the dancefloor crazy with Bananarama\u2019s first single, Aie A Mwana, Papa\u2019s Got a Brand New Pigbag, the Cure\u2019s A Forest, a bit of Joy Division \u2026\u201d He became an \u201capprentice\u201d to the beloved London club scene fixture Tasty Tim, filling in at the Mud Club in Leicester Square. There, they played glam rock, disco, Gary Glitter, \u201cmy mum\u2019s terrible show tunes\u201d, Demis Roussos, Julie Andrews, anything to get a reaction. \u201cSuddenly, I\u2019m sexy, I\u2019m desirable!\u201d The Mud Club slots led to warehouse parties, where Moore would play hip-hop and early house in one corner of a vast storehouse decorated by industrial bricolageurs the Mutoid Waste Company (\u201cit looked like Mad Max\u201d) while Soul II Soul played funk in the other.         Superfly Guy by S\u2019Express.    After house music appeared in 1985, its counterintuitive minimalism confused the rare-groove-fixated London crowds. \u201cYou\u2019d play amazing records like Strings of Life at Heaven and the gay crowd would get it immediately,\u201d he says, \u201cbut at a warehouse party people didn\u2019t know how to dance to it.\u201d The arrival of ecstasy soon changed that \u2013 and Moore, too, who was now DJing at Shoom, one of the earliest acid clubs. \u201cE definitely made me more hedonistic, and skinnier,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it had that effect on everyone. It got to the point that the Shoom newsletter had to warn everyone: \u2018Don\u2019t give up your day jobs.\u2019 Suddenly nobody wanted to do anything except take E and go out all the time.\u201d While DJing, Moore had encouraged Rhythm King Records, the label at the heart of early British dance music, to put out records by Renegade Soundwave and the Beatmasters featuring the Cookie Crew. By way of appreciation for their success, the label booked him studio time with a programmer called Pascal Gabriel. \u201cAll I had was a load of ideas on cassette that I wanted to sample,\u201d Moore remembers. \u201cI wanted to do with disco what the hip-hop guys had done with soul: chop it up, reassemble it. You were supposed to hate disco back then, but, of course, I loved it.\u201d In the course of a few days, Moore and Gabriel made Superfly Guy, Hey Music Lover and the titanic Theme from S\u2019Express. In hindsight, Theme \u2013 along with Bomb the Bass\u2019s Beat Dis \u2013 crystallised a brief moment when house music and pop music were as one. Yet, at the time, Rhythm King\u2019s promotions people thought the record too outlandish for radio and demanded a more conventional version. \u201cThey wanted it to sound like a PWL record,\u201d says Moore, referring to the label, run by Pete Waterman, whose 1988 hits included Kylie\u2019s I Should Be So Lucky and Pat and Mick\u2019s Let\u2019s All Chant. \u201cSo, me and Pascal deliberately did the worst radio mix we could \u2013 it was totally inept.\u201d Horrified, the label relented and put out the original version instead. It went on to dislodge Heart by the Pet Shop Boys from No 1. \u201cThat slightly ruined the moment for me,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind knocking something rubbish off the top, but the Pet Shop Boys?\u201d Thus began S\u2019Express\u2019s short but enjoyable period as pop stars. Moore had assembled a band of \u201cterrible showoffs\u201d from among his club friends. Nobody needed to play anything; they just had to look right on Top of the Pops. \u201cI\u2019d modelled it on early Roxy Music, a postmodern pop group from outer space,\u201d he says. \u201cAt first, it was amazing. Wherever you went, you had the keys to the city and every day was your birthday.\u201d     \u2018I never saw punk as this nihilistic, negative thing\u2019 \u2013 Mark Moore. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    He met hip-hop originals Mantronix and his punk heroes Siouxsie and Budgie; he remixed Prince and Malcolm McLaren and took Philip Glass to a rave. The minimalist composer stood still in the middle of the dancefloor and finally told Moore that, yes, he thought he got it now. Moore had asked Glass if it was OK if the band took ecstasy before they went out. \u201cThe thing about you young people,\u201d Glass replied, \u201cis that you think you\u2019re the only ones who\u2019ve ever taken drugs.\u201d Then, says Moore, he did a pill with them. (Glass later remixed Hey Music Lover in surprisingly boshing fashion.) The familiar round of promotions and interviews \u2013 plus the pressure to make conventional albums when all he really wanted to do was release 12ins for the clubs \u2013 meant that the pop life quickly palled for Moore. He and Gabriel parted ways. In one interview from the days when he was \u201chating every moment\u201d, future author Jane Bussman asked what was exciting Mark Moore of S\u2019Express at the moment. \u201cAnd then they just printed the word SILENCE,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThat was about the size of it. All the fun went out of it. I just wanted to withdraw and get back to DJing.\u201d Which is what he did for the ensuing 20 years, reconnecting with alternating waves of euphoric disco and harsh electronics until \u2013 when a new wave of London gay nights such as Sink the Pink and Horse Meat Disco appeared \u2013 he fitted right in. \u201cThere\u2019s an edge to those places that I really love,\u201d Moore says. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction to the gay mainstream, which to me is just the same as the straight mainstream: get the perfect body, use loads of hair products, fit in. I can\u2019t identify with that. You look at the way club kids are now and it\u2019s much more interesting. They\u2019re all polysexual and drag is the new punk.\u201d These days, he often plays alongside DJs who are literally the children of his old punk friends, such as the Lovely Jonjo from Dalston Superstore. Is he surprised, then, that the clubbing explosion that created him turned out not to be a one-off, but a neverending cycle? \u201cI was hoping we\u2019d get music that was so futuristic I couldn\u2019t understand it, because I\u2019m too old,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut, if you\u2019re 20, discovering disco and house must be as exciting as my mates rediscovering rockabilly records that were made before they were born. So I\u2019m optimistic. I\u2019m always optimistic.\u201d Then he tells me how he and his friends used to go through Genesis P-Orridge\u2019s bins in London Fields, looking for \u201cart and pornography and treasures\u201d. The old goat of Throbbing Gristle duly invited them in for tea. Moore\u2019s acid punk London? Oh, that\u2019s bad. No. That\u2019s good. Enjoy This Trip is released on 27 May on Needle Boss.",
