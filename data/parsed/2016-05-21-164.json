At the coffee shop\u2019s \u201cDestination Cornwall\u201d display, you can buy clotted cream shortbread, clotted cream fudge and, if your lily required further gilding, Poldark-themed Cornish ale. There\u2019s a newspaper rack, too, which has run out of this week\u2019s edition of the Cornish Guardian. It was published on Wednesday and, next to a voucher for a two-for-one \u201ccoffee and traybake\u201d offer at Warrens Bakery, carried a startling front-page story.   Related: Queen's speech 2016: the key points explained    \u201cSPACE RACE IS ON,\u201d read the headline, over a photograph of a giant rocket in lift-off, and a smaller illustration of this airport\u2019s potential transformation. \u201cTourists looking for a holiday that\u2019s literally out of this world could soon be blasting off into space \u2013 from Newquay,\u201d began the report. It was the day of the Queen\u2019s speech, in which the government confirmed its support for Britain\u2019s first spaceport, where aircraft, taking off horizontally rather than vertically, are set to launch satellites and tourists into orbit. In 2014, coalition ministers announced a shortlist of eight potential sites. There are now six contenders: four in Scotland, Llanbedr Airport in Wales and Newquay, where the sign on the way into town says: \u201cWelcome to the coast of dreams.\u201d This tiny airport, which sits among grazing sheep just three miles from the renowned surf at Newquay, is being tipped locally and in Westminster as the frontrunner in an unlikely domestic space race. And while all of this is news to the town\u2019s wetsuit wearers (\u201cMate, I\u2019m more worried if there\u2019s any surf,\u201d says Dan at the Slide & Glide surf shop), local business and political figures are fighting hard to launch Britain\u2019s poorest region into the new space age. But the dream exists under a cloud of uncertainty. The government had intended to launch the first planes into space by 2018. But at Newquay, the asphalt remains untouched. No architect has been employed, nor any deal struck with a spaceflight company. Nobody knows what exactly the proposed Modern Transport Bill will require of the chosen site, or what it will cost to build. \u201cI think things need to accelerate now, but we\u2019re confident we can deliver by the end of this parliament, in 2020, says Miles Carden, who manages Aerohub, an aerospace enterprise zone based at the airport. During a tour of the airfield, Carden, who leads the spaceport bid with unbowed enthusiasm, shows off Newquay\u2019s intergalactic credentials alongside Steve Gardner, the airport\u2019s airside manager.      \u201cThere in front of you is three and three-quarter million square feet of runway surface,\u201d says Gardner, a former RAF air traffic controller. He has parked the airport\u2019s minibus at the eastern end of one of Britain\u2019s longest runways. Extended to accommodate giant bombers in its former life as a military airport, the 2.7km (1.7 mile) strip catapults aircraft over the Atlantic into relatively clear airspace, and away from built-up areas. The furthest you can fly thereafter today, or at least on Wednesdays and Sundays, is to Alicante, with Ryanair. But the runway\u2019s length and position, and close links to London (just 40 minutes to Gatwick) make Newquay a strong contender for much more distant flight. There is also plenty of land \u2013 850 acres owned by the council, including 650 acres that do not require planning permission. On the south side of the airfield, across the runway from the passenger terminal, sit eight cold-war-era hangars rusting slowly. One houses a museum, while another is already accustomed to the sounds of big engines; it is the test base for Bloodhound SSC, the British attempt to drive a rocket-powered car at more than 1,000mph. Carden and Gardner are more modest about what a Cornish spaceport would look like than the local paper\u2019s front page. As they return to the glorified huts that serve as the airport\u2019s HQ, an adapted Dassault Falcon jet comes into land. \u201cEvery Thursday, which is locally called the Thursday war, it goes out to sea and simulates naval attacks,\u201d Gardner says. Sensors and emitters hang below the wings like missiles. \u201cOne of those could easily be a detachable rocket with microsatellites in it,\u201d Carden adds. The physical and safety challenges of vertical rocket launches mean any UK spaceport will be a base for spacecraft strapped to traditional planes, to be released at altitude. Virgin Galactic announced last December that its LauncherOne vehicle, which will put satellites into orbit, will be unleashed from the belly of a retired 747 airliner. It had planned to use its own White Knight aircraft, with its distinctive twin fuselages, but this will now only be used to launch the SpaceShipTwo passenger plane, one of which disintegrated during a test flight in 2014, killing the pilot. This setback, and other challenges, make it likely that, in the UK, satellite launches will come some time before human spaceflight.   Related: Richard Branson: \u2018Millions of people would love to become astronauts\u2019    Whatever its use, a Newquay spaceport could look like a more polished version of its current self, with new hangars and a terminal working alongside the existing flight schedule. \u201cIf they said today, \u2018We\u2019re going to start work on it next week,\u2019 this is where it will go,\u201d Gardner says, pointing at the land next to the cold war shelters. But they haven\u2019t said that, and the taxiway to takeoff looks long and bumpy. The airport\u2019s business plan relies on the support of a major player in commercial space flight. Virgin Galactic, which has bases in California and New Mexico, is the most prominent, but it has expressed only vague interest in a British outpost. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to participate in the ongoing dialogue with industry,\u201d is the closest a spokesperson comes to an endorsement. XCOR Aerospace, a large US rival of Virgin\u2019s, does not respond to questions at all. Buried deep in the minutes of the government\u2019s Science and Technology Committee\u2019s evidence lie further seeds of doubt. As part of its ongoing satellites and space inquiry, which launched last year, the committee has canvassed opinions from big industry players of the sort Newquay may depend on. Airbus and the British satellites giant Inmarsat have questioned the economic and scientific case for a UK spaceport. Inmarsat has said it has no problem finding sites elsewhere to launch satellites and that \u201cthere is no particular reason to require a UK site\u201d. In January, Avanti, another satellite firm, said the UK\u2019s thriving space sector could grow sufficiently without a spaceport. \u201cIf it gets built and used well it will be fascinating,\u201d says Dr Robert Massey, deputy executive director at the Royal Astronomical Society. \u201cBut I\u2019m not convinced of the commercial case, and if big companies like Inmarsat seem sceptical, we should be arguing whether this is something we should be spending a lot of time and money on.\u201d     \u2018Anything that gets more people here is a good thing\u2019 \u2026Cornwall is officially the poorest county in Britain. Photograph: Alamy    Not that it\u2019s even clear where that money will come from. Carden says that significant public funding will be required to get the project off the ground, but there are no clear signs that it will be forthcoming. In March, the science minister Jo Johnson told the same committee that the government intended to facilitate rather than fund the development of a spaceport. \u201cWe have always made it clear that this is primarily a commercial enterprise,\u201d he said. The EU might be relied upon to step in, having invested almost \u00a32bn in Cornwall over the past 20 years. But, to the consternation of many there, five of Cornwall\u2019s six MPs \u2013 all Conservatives \u2013 want to leave the EU. \u201cWe would need to make the case to the UK government to continue to support the Cornish economy and I\u2019m confident we can do that,\u201d says Steve Double, the MP for St Austell and Newquay. \u201cThat has such a hollow ring to it,\u201d Loveday Jenkin says. The councillor and leading figure in Mebyon Kernow, Cornwall\u2019s nationalist party, accuses Westminster of neglecting the county, and does not expect that to change. Kim Conchie, the pro-EU chief executive of the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, worries about the impact of politics on the spaceport bid, which he also supports. \u201cThe referendum comes at a tricky time,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the shit hits the fan, Cameron resigns and political machinations take over, this could very easily be put on the back burner again.\u201d Add to the cloud of confusion a number of unresolved questions about regulation, licensing, unreliable weather, and safety, and it becomes increasingly hard to see the future at a rain-soaked Newquay Airport. But there is no dampening the enthusiasm of locals. Carden and Gardner are confident that Newquay can deliver space flight. Moreover, they envisage the spaceport as the cornerstone of an existing plan to use science to create high-quality jobs and inspire young people, many of whom tend to leave Cornwall in adulthood.

Newell\u2019s travel agency welcomes the opportunity to add space to its list of destinations, while wondering how many locals will be able to afford tickets. Will they even want to go? \u201cI will if there\u2019s a job up there,\u201d says Graham, a surfer walking up Fore Street. Suzanne Postings, a local reiki healer and taxi driver, wonders if the arrival of new, high-skilled jobs will just drive rents and property prices to ever-higher levels. The businesses that rely most on tourism are keen. \u201cWe suffer because we\u2019re not by the coast, but if we had something like a spaceport, gosh, it would be brilliant,\u201d says John Hicks, who runs the Smuggler\u2019s Inn. The modest pub has eight rooms opposite the current passenger terminal. \u201cAnything that gets more people here is a good thing,\u201d says Bonita Snook, who runs the village stores, post office and tearoom in St Mawgan, a tiny village just a mile down the hill from the runway. At the airport, where passengers are starting to arrive for the evening Flybe flight to London, Gardner points to a photograph pinned next to his desk. It was taken at a science museum in Toronto, where he took his young son on holiday three years ago. Father and son look at each other from behind life-size cutouts of astronauts. \u201cWhen I grow up I want to be a spaceman!\u201d Gardner says in a speech bubble next to his helmet. \u201cBy the time he grows up I WILL be a spaceman!\u201d the boy says back. It was a joke at the time, but, Gardner says, \u201cMaybe my son can do that, and do it in Cornwall.\u201d",
