  "body": "Tourists in New Zealand would have to display a \u2018T-plate\u2019 on their cars and sit a driving test under an idea promoted by petitioners on social media. According to the New Zealand Transport Agency less than 6% of serious crashes between 2010 to 2014 involved foreign drivers.    Related: New Zealand warns hikers away from Lord of the Rings volcano    But as foreign tourist numbers have soared in New Zealand \u2013 with more than 3.2 million visitors last year \u2013 public concern has grown that foreign drivers do not have adequate skills to handle New Zealand\u2019s mountainous terrain and narrow roads.  The Facebook group T-plates for Tourists has gained 3,000 likes, while its petition calling for mandatory T-plates and a driving test for foreign drivers has more than 200 signatures \u2013 well shy of the 5,000 that campaign organiser Josh (he does not want to use his last name) would like before taking it to parliament. \u201cI started it because I think there needs to be a change in the conditions for letting overseas drivers on to our roads,\u201d said Josh by email.  \u201cOver the last five years there have been 13.6 fatalities involving overseas drivers. 14 people that could have survived if overseas drivers were more informed.\u201dThe idea has raised concern that clearly marking vehicles as belonging to tourists could make them a target for crime such as burglaries, and dissuade tourists from visiting the country.

This idea had nothing factual to stand on at all.\u201d Jim Harland, southern regional director for the NZ Transport Agency and a member of the cross-Agency Visiting Drivers Group said the suggestion had been made before. \u201cIt was not clear how labelling the vehicle in this way would prevent crashes by changing the behaviour of the driver or encouraging more tolerant behaviour from other drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cA further issue to consider is that in implementing this there would likely be an increase in tourists\u2019 vehicles being broken into and property stolen, due to the vehicles being labelled.\u201d",
