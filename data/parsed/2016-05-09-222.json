  "body": "When things go bad, it always helps if we can pretend it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault. This book is what happens when we run out of people to blame. It\u2019s the story of 16 year old Ant and her 11 year old brother Mattie, locked up in Britain\u2019s first family prison. Ant might not be everyone\u2019s idea of a hero, but she\u2019s all we\u2019ve got!  Blame is my first book aimed at a YA audience and I really hope you enjoy seeing the cover and reading the opening chapters for the first time. You\u2019ll have to wait a little while to read the rest, as Blame doesn\u2019t come out until July 2016.      I hope you enjoy reading the start of my YA debut thriller Blame. I\u2019d love to know what you think on Twitter. You can follow me on @simonmayo and use #AreYouToBlame.         Related: Itchcraft by Simom Mayo - review",
