  "body": "If Donald Trump is eager to avoid the large, impassioned, noisy protests that almost derailed his last visit to California \u2013 and maybe he\u2019s not \u2013 he has certainly picked the wrong location for his return trip on Wednesday. Anaheim may be the home of Disneyland and a reliable source of affluent, conservative white voters in the suburban tracts an hour south of Los Angeles, but it is also bubbling over with tensions, as a restive and growing Latino minority clamors for greater political representation, a less repressive police force and a more tolerant environment for immigrants and their families.    Related: Reality stars and xenophobes: Trump's California delegates mirror their maker    In February, protesters furious at Trump\u2019s hesitation to disavow the support of the white supremacist movement clashed with members of the Ku Klux Klan in an Anaheim park, resulting in three stabbings and two other vicious assaults. Two months later, on the eve of Trump\u2019s first visit to southern California as a presidential candidate, the Anaheim city council came to blows over a proposed resolution to denounce Trump\u2019s rhetoric against immigrants, Muslims and women.  Relations between the Latino community and the police, which will be spearheading security at the Trump rally, have been punctuated in recent years by high-profile officer shootings, riots, and one court filing accusing the police department of behaving \u201clike a death squad\u201d in targeting suspected gang members. Gustavo Arellano, the editor of the alternative Orange County Weekly and a well-known activist for Latino immigrant rights, described Anaheim as a \u201criot-happy city\u201d and added: \u201cWith this move, we now know that Trump is actively wishing for chaos to happen.\u201d     Young people express their distaste for Donald Trump outside a Bernie Sanders rally in California on 21 May.

I know that he provokes a very bad feeling among the many communities that he has stepped on,\u201d said Ada Brice\u00f1o, one of Orange County\u2019s most visible Latino activists and an official with Unite Here, a union representing low-wage workers in the garment and hospitality industries. \u201cI guarantee you that there\u2019ll be a lot of people there. They\u2019re coming out of anger. It\u2019s very grassroots. I don\u2019t know that there are any organizations leading them.\u201d  In a wild and unpredictable campaign season, California has put up by far the noisiest resistance to the Trump campaign, jamming the two venues where he appeared late last month, running rings around a sizable police and secret service presence in Costa Mesa, not far from Anaheim, and forcing the candidate to scuttle across a freeway and through a hole in a fence to address the GOP state convention at a San Francisco airport hotel.           Anti-Trump protest turns violent in California.    Protest leaders said then they were just getting started, and this week \u2013 first in Anaheim and then, on Friday, in San Diego \u2013 they will have an opportunity to make good on their word.  \u201cI would be greatly surprised if California did not find a way to resist Trump every time he sets foot in this state,\u201d said Cat Brooks, a Black Power activist based in Oakland and co-founder of the Anti Police-Terror Project. Leaders also hope, as the general election gears up, that activists in other states will be inspired by their example and deploy a similarly wide array of civil disobedience techniques: blocking off roads, parking lots and freeway exits, penetrating event venues with bullhorns, even using teams of climbers to drop banners from balconies or suspend them mid-air from helium balloons. \u201cWe have friends and allies all over the country,\u201d said Linda Capato, a queer activist from San Francisco. \u201cThe more Trump engages in this hateful rhetoric, the more people will feel compelled to escalate their response.\u201d      Trump\u2019s visit to the California GOP state convention in April led to clashes between police and protesters.

Many Republican analysts saw only an upswell in support for Trump as television news carried images of protesters smashing the windows of a police cruiser or throwing rocks at officers in Costa Mesa last month, and expect a similar upswell if any protests this week are marred by violence. \u201cThis is what Trump wants, it\u2019s giving him his talking points,\u201d said Jimmy Camp, a Republican consultant and member of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement within his party.  The protesters themselves counter that last month\u2019s violence and property damage was sporadic and limited and that the real story was the way they mobilized support at very short notice. \u201cA lot of people want to dismiss us as troublemakers and rabble-rousers, but what you\u2019re dealing with are highly sophisticated, very grounded, very committed organizers with a strong vision of what they want the future of this country to look like,\u201d Brooks said.  Many community leaders, however, are deeply worried about passions running out of control and are urging people to express their views peacefully. \u201cAll it takes is a few people from both sides to start escalating the rhetoric,\u201d said Henry Vandermeir, chair of the Orange County Democratic party. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be putting fuel on the fire.\u201d",
