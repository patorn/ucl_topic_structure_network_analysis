  "body": "The children and social work bill, included in Wednesday\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech, promises key changes for children\u2019s services. Under the bill, adoption would be prioritised over short-term foster care placements, and a new care leavers\u2019 covenant would be introduced to provide young people leaving care with better support. The government said the bill would \u201ctackle state failure and transform the outcomes of children in care, so that we give all of them the hope of a better future\u201d. The announcements \u2013 many of which were trailed over the weekend \u2013 have provoked discussion in the social care sector. Tweet us your views on @GdnSocialCare, or leave a comment below this article. Responses from the sector Kevin Williams, chief executive of the Fostering Network: \u201cWhile the Fostering Network welcomes the prime minister\u2019s self-declared \u2018unashamedly pro-adoption\u2019 stance, and his subsequent backing of this stance in his government\u2019s legislative agenda as set out in the Queen\u2019s speech, we ask the government to understand that adoption and foster care are not mutually exclusive. On behalf of the vast majority of children in care, who will spend their childhoods in loving, stable and secure foster families, we call on this government to be unashamedly pro foster care as well.  \u201cAdoption may be the best route to permanence for some children, and we have no doubts that post-adoption support should be improved. However it will always be a small minority of children in the care system for whom adoption is the most appropriate route to permanence. The vast majority of children in care will live with foster families, some of whom will spend their whole childhood with one foster family. The prime minister is right to want to give children who may be adopted every chance of a positive future, yet his approach only focuses on a minority of children in care \u2013 and that does all children a disservice.\u201d Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardo\u2019s: \u201cBarnardo\u2019s has long called for support to be extended for care leavers until they are 25 years, so this improvement is welcome. Young people leaving care don\u2019t have a parent to guide and support them into adulthood and can be more vulnerable due to the instability they\u2019ve faced in their lives.  \u201cWhat we\u2019d like to see now is a firm commitment from government to measuring outcomes for care leavers, as that transparency could then drive further progress. There are other huge gaps in support for care leavers, such as having the right accommodation and support with education, employment and training.\u201d Matthew Reed, chief executive of The Children\u2019s Society: \u201cWe know that the life chances and outcomes for care leavers are significantly worse than for those who have not grown up in care. The government must address the problem of children in care being uprooted and moved miles away from their communities. It must also make sure care leavers get priority and consistent access to mental health support to tackle the significant disadvantages faced by those growing up in care.\u201d Imelda Redmond, chief executive of 4Children: \u201cToday\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech outlined the government\u2019s welcome commitment to helping the most disadvantaged through the new life chances strategy. \u201cThe government committed to ensuring public services better help the hardest to reach. Children\u2019s centres are well placed to support all families, from those who require universal services and light touch support to those on the edge of crisis in need of more targeted help \u2013 a trusted resource, rooted in local communities, which bring a range of services and professionals together under one roof.\u201d Dan Scorer, head of policy at Mencap: \u201cThis Queen\u2019s speech committed the government to \u201ctackle poverty and deprivation\u201d and improve life chances of the most disadvantaged. Disabled people and their families are some of the most disadvantaged in our society, with 20% of families with at least one disabled member living in poverty, yet there was no mention as to how these inequalities would be addressed. \u201cPeople with a learning disability have seen the support they receive heavily reduced from severe cuts to benefits and social care, and despite the government\u2019s manifesto commitment to halve the disability employment gap among disabled people there has been no clear action.\u201d Andrew Isaac, spokesperson for the Children\u2019s Services Development Group: \u201cCSDG warmly welcomes the government\u2019s continued clear and transformative commitment to improving children\u2019s services. New standards for local authorities as \u2018corporate parents\u2019 is a step in the right direction. CSDG has been constructively engaging with the government over a long period to highlight the entrenched bias that exists as a result of local authorities being both the commissioner and the provider of children\u2019s services. This relationship invariably means that children are placed in services perceived to be the lowest cost, rather than those which best meet their needs. We hope this renewed focus on ensuring authorities act as a \u2018corporate parent\u2019 will improve placement decisions and long-term outcomes.\u201d Join the Social Care Network to read more pieces like this.
