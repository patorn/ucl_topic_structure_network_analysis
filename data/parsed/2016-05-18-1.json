  "body": "Vice-president Joe Biden on Wednesday downplayed simmering tensions in the Democratic race for president as pressure mounts on Bernie Sanders to condemn supporters who threatened party leaders at a state party convention in Nevada last weekend. Speaking to reporters during a visit to the battleground state of Ohio, where the vice-president delivered remarks on the economy, Biden said \u201cthere\u2019s no fundamental split in the Democratic party\u201d.   Related: Sanders condemns Nevada convention violence but refuses to apologize    \u201cI\u2019m confident that Bernie will be supportive if Hillary wins, which the numbers indicate will happen. So I\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said, following a retail stop at a local market with Senate candidate Ted Strickland of Ohio. \u201cBernie Sanders is a good guy. Let Bernie run the race. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d he added, pointing out that Clinton in 2008 remained in the Democratic primary until June. When asked if he had seen video footage of Sanders supporters displaying their frustration with the nominating process in Nevada by throwing chairs and hurling death threats, Biden sought to separate their actions from Sanders and his candidacy. \u201cThat\u2019s not Bernie, and what Bernie\u2019s going to have to do if that happens again \u2013 he\u2019s going to have to be more aggressive in speaking out about it,\u201d Biden said. The Nevada Democratic party issued a formal complaint on Tuesday in response to the conduct of Sanders supporters, in which it characterized the weekend\u2019s events as \u201ca very dangerous atmosphere that ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats\u201d.   Related: Democrats face their own unity crisis amid Nevada convention fallout    Sanders, in turn, issued a statement condemning \u201cany and all forms of violence\u201d but also fired back that the Democratic party of Nevada had used its power \u201cto prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place\u201d. His reaction earned the scorn of Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who in an interview with CNN on Tuesday evening said Sanders\u2019 response \u201cwas anything but acceptable\u201d. \u201cIt certainly did not condemn the supporters for the violence and added more fuel to the fire,\u201d she said. \u201cThere should never be a \u2018but\u2019 when it comes to violence and intimidation.\u201d Biden expressed certainty that despite the fracas, Sanders supporters would eventually come around to Clinton in a general election. He also reflected on her vice-presidential choices, observing that Sherrod Brown, the senator from Ohio who accompanied Biden on the trip, would be \u201ca great choice\u201d. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of really qualified folks for number two,\u201d he added. \u201cHillary has a plethora of really good people to pick from, for real.\u201d",
