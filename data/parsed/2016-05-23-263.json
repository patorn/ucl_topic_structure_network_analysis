  "body": "Leading shares are searching for direction at the start of the new trading week, but Royal Mail has risen sharply after positive comments about last week\u2019s results. Its shares are up 17.6p or 3.5% to 509.5p as analysts at RBC moved their recommendation from underperform to sector perform and lifted their target price from 445p to 525p. Meanwhile Cantor Fitzgerald issued a buy note with a forecast raised from 530p to 550p. Cantor\u2019s Robin Byde said:  Royal Mail\u2019s full year update was encouraging. Revenue and operating profits were up year on year and ahead of consensus estimates. European parcels continue to drive growth with cost cutting and productivity gains helping to protect margins in UK letters. Following the update, our forecast changes are minor. We expect parcels in the UK and Europe to drive the top-line and restructuring and productivity gains to support the bottom-line. Even with forecast hefty capex, free cash should be healthy. Royal Mail faces potentially tough wage and pension negotiations this year but the risks are probably overstated. The stock is good value, trading on a calendar 2016 estimated PE discount of 16% to the sector. Our forecast dividend yield is 4.8%.   Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 12.19 points at 6178.51, recovering from an initial fall. Mining shares are under pressure once more after weak manufacturing and trade data from Japan, and the continuing rise in the dollar. Anglo American is down 17.6p at 582.7p while BHP Billiton has lost 13.8p to 804.1p. Inmarsat continues to decline following its recent disappointing update, down 20.5p at 734.5p as it faces the prospect of being relegated from the FTSE 100 at next week\u2019s quarterly reshuffle. At the same time Morgan Stanley has moved from equal weight to overweight and slashed its price target from \u00a313.50 to 800p:  We lower earnings per share forecasts by 18-22% for 2017-2018, assume the 2018 guidance is dropped, and move to equal weight.  Among the mid-caps Sports Direct International - which lost its place in the leading index at the last reorganisation - is down 19.9p at 349.1p as Goldman Sachs cut from buy to neutral.",
