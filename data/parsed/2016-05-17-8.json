  "body": "A Chicago police officer whom the department was trying to fire after he fatally shot an unarmed 22-year-old woman in 2012 has decided to resign from the force rather than fight to retain his job. The city\u2019s police board said on Tuesday that Dante Servin, who was off duty when he killed Rekia Boyd, had quit. It came two days before Servin was to appear for a hearing at which the board was to decide if he should be fired, as former police superintendent Garry McCarthy recommended last year.  Boyd was with friends when Servin opened fire after he said he saw a person in the group moving toward him with a gun. Police found only a cellphone. Servin was charged with involuntary manslaughter, though a judge later dismissed the charges.  Servin\u2019s resignation now saves him from the risk of a possible firing from the department and the loss of his pension. It also means the Chicago police board must withdraw all charges brought against him with no prejudice.   Related: Chicago's much-criticized police review authority replaced with civilian agency    Servin\u2019s resignation comes almost a year after he was acquitted of all manslaughter charges related to the death of Boyd in 2012. He pulled a gun out while off duty and shot into a crowd, fatally striking Boyd in her head.  The judge at his trial said prosecutors had failed to adequately prove he had acted \u201crecklessly\u201d, suggesting the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had mischarged Servin.  \u201cIt is intentional and the crime, if any there be, is first-degree murder,\u201d judge Dennis Porter said in his seven-page ruling, implying prosecutors should have charged Servin with murder, not involuntary manslaughter.  His acquittal, as well as the handling of the release of a dashboard camera video showing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald being shot 16 times, led to a city-wide activist campaign credited as a major factor in incumbent state\u2019s attorney Anita Alvarez\u2019s loss to Kim Foxx during the city\u2019s Democratic primary election in March. Activists in Chicago and around the US who have used Boyd\u2019s story as an emblem in their battle to end police violence and impunity see Servin\u2019s ability to resign before being held accountable as evidence of a broken system.  \u201cDante Servin\u2019s resignation announcement two days before the termination hearing was set to begin reflects the fact that he knew he was going to be fired for murdering Rekia Boyd,\u201d Aislinn Sol, the leader of the Black Lives Matter Movement in Chicago told the Guardian.  \u201cA full overhaul of this system is still clearly needed beginning with mayor Rahm Emanuel,\u201d Sol continued. \u201cWe need the community in power for hiring and firing officers.\u201d Activists who have been pushing for Servin\u2019s firing from the beginning say that his resignation does not resolve the larger issues at hand for Chicago and plan to continue pushing for change in Chicago this Thursday at the next police board monthly meeting. \u201cThe facts have shown us that the current system is incapable of providing basic safety to the people of Chicago,\u201d she continued.
