  "body": "Ryan Giggs, we are told, needs time to think things over. And no wonder, because currently the Welshman can\u2019t make any sense of the notion that it is essential for him to remain at Manchester United as a bridge between the club\u2019s glorious past and bright future \u2013 after all, he has been right there in the dugout for the past three seasons as the fabled Manchester United Way went the way of the Preston Invincibles and the Magical Magyars so, as things stand, his skills as a heritage officer appear to be on a par, at best, with Marouane Fellaini\u2019s ability as a cello player \u2013 which is to say he may be a virtuoso but we\u2019ve seen sod all evidence of that.

At least that is the word on some streets, and some people seem to believe it so much that they have staked hard cash on Giggs becoming the next Everton manager. Should have put it in the poor box, lads. And bookies are also taking bets on the Goodison Park gig going to be Manuel Pellegrini, as if Everton are crying out for a Spanish-speaking boss who can occasionally encourage flamboyant attacking but has trouble repairing defences. Frank de Boer would also be prepared to talk about the Everton job, in case anyone out there hasn\u2019t already heard him talking about it.  Ronald Koeman, by contrast, will not be talking about the Everton job, not if the Daily Mirror are right and he is about to sign a contract extension at Southampton.  Meanwhile back at Manchester United, the new manager \u2013 and sadly there are no indications as to who that might be \u2013 is inevitably being linked with swoops for Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema.  Chelsea will not be buying Koke. The Spain midfielder has decided to stay at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, apparently.

Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly batted away a bid of around \u00a350m for young Brazilian central defender Marquinhos and, what is more, they\u2019ve toldBar\u00e7a not to bother coming back with an improved offer. Perhaps the Catalans will join Chelsea and Manchester City in chasing John Stones. Crystal Palace will attempt to sharpen their attack by signing the former Newcastle and Chelsea striker Demba Ba. Alan Pardew also wants to be reunited with Cheik Tiot\u00e9 (yellow card) and Davide Santon. Swansea may listen to offers for Andr\u00e9 Ayew, who is a target for West Ham and, in particular, Sunderland. Sam Allardyce also fancies picking up James Morrison for free from West Brom.",
