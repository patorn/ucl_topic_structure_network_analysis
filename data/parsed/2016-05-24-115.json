  "body": "Steve Hilton, the prime minister\u2019s former \u201cblue skies thinker,\u201d has said the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been \u201cbullied\u201d by the Westminster establishment because of his unconventional approach to politics. David Cameron used a Commons encounter with Corbyn in February to take him to task for not properly fastening a tie, saying: \u201cI know what my mother would say. I think she\u2019d look across the dispatch box and she\u2019d say: put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem.\u201d But Cameron\u2019s former adviser, in London this week to promote the UK edition of his book More Human, told the Guardian: \u201cWhat I really hated about the reaction to Corbyn at the very beginning was this immediate, \u2026 very bullying ganging-up by the political establishment to say: this guy is not doing it the way we are used to doing it; he\u2019s not wearing a tie; he\u2019s not reshuffling his cabinet in the way we\u2019re used to doing it.\u201d He added: \u201cI thought it was incredibly unattractive.\u201d Hilton said he found \u201cmuch to welcome\u201d when Corbyn, with his unpolished style and appeal to a \u201ckinder, gentler politics\u201d, won the Labour leadership race \u2013 though he feared Corbyn did not have the skills required for the role. \u201cThe point of being leader of the opposition is that it\u2019s quite a tough job, in terms of pure management. It\u2019s not easy, and I think that\u2019s where he\u2019s coming unstuck. But that kind of impulse of really representing a break with the way things are done is something I really share.\u201d   Related: Britain\u2019s two-party political system isn\u2019t working | Steve Hilton    Hilton believes Corbyn\u2019s popularity reflects the same anti-establishment forces that have propelled Donald Trump to a compelling lead in the US Republican primaries, and allowed the avowed socialist Bernie Sanders to run Hillary Clinton far closer than many commentators expected. \u201cI think that Corbyn\u2019s success, just as the success of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, is a reflection of this frustration that people have that whatever they do, in terms of voting for different parties, nothing much seems to change,\u201d he said. Hilton was a central figure in the modernisation of the Conservative party, brought into No 10 by Cameron to foster radical ideas including the \u201cbig society\u201d. He was notorious for roaming barefoot around Downing Street, and was parodied as the jargon-spouting Stewart Pearson in the political satire The Thick of It. After leaving No 10 for California in 2012, Hilton says he has lost faith in the capacity of mainstream politicians to improve people\u2019s lives, and barely follows the fortunes of the Conservatives, the party that once brought him into the heart of government. He has started a tech company, Crowdpac, which aims to help raise money to fund independent candidates to run for public office without the backing of a party. \u201cI think that is something I feel very, very strongly about, which is for decades now there\u2019s been this growing reality that whoever has been in office, the same people are in power,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Corbyn was elected, I found there was a lot to welcome there.\u201d In language that could equally be used by Corbyn\u2019s lieutenant and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, Hilton said: \u201cIt is a technocratic elite of bankers, bureaucrats and accountants that push a particular agenda, which is all about centralisation of economic power in the hands of fewer and fewer big businesses, and centralisation of political power, which means that people at grassroots level feel they have less and less control over the things that matter to them, and people are getting more and more fed up with it.\u201d   Related: More Human by Steve Hilton \u2013 digested read    He believes Trump, rather than being the extreme figure that US liberals fear, would help to tackle some of the deep-seated problems in the country\u2019s political life. \u201cI think that he\u2019s going to win,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cI think it could be a really refreshing change, frankly. That doesn\u2019t mean I agree with everything he\u2019s saying, but I very much agree with the arguments he\u2019s making about the rottenness of the current system in America.\u201d He added: \u201cTrump makes really, really powerful arguments, for example in relation to healthcare. He talks about the cartels and the concentration of power and the health insurance companies effectively having monopolies and ripping people off.\u201d",
