  "body": "Columbus Crew take on Colorado without Kei Kamara Well, how about that for a trade? On Thursday, Columbus Crew, second bottom in the Eastern Conference, made an announcement to shock the league: they were trading their top player, MLS all-star and leading goalscorer Kei Kamara, to New England. Apparently because of a penalty that he felt he should have taken against Montreal.   Related: Columbus trade Kei Kamara to New England after penalty argument    Columbus insist it\u2019s a good deal for a player who\u2019ll be 32 in September, and who, that penalty spat notwithstanding, has a reputation for being difficult to handle. In return the Crew get some general allocation money, targeted allocation money, two future draft picks and 2016 international roster spot. Columbus will also retain a percentage of any future transfer fee for Kamara if he moves outside MLS. But is it a smart move?            \u201cKei had a memorable 2015 season and we recognize and understand how popular and productive he was, so this decision was not one we made lightly,\u201d head coach Gregg Berhalter said after the shock transfer. \u201cOur actions will always reflect the values of our club and we believe this transaction will improve our competitiveness this year and in future years.\u201d Well, that\u2019s all very well and good, but who\u2019s going to score the goals? The notion that the Crew will be improved this year without Kamara is simply fantasy. The team has just traded away its best player in what seems to be a fit of pique, and let\u2019s not forget, the Crew have only won two of their nine games so far, even with Kamara in decent scoring form. Much now rests on the slim shoulders of Ethan Finlay, Federico Higuian and Justin Meram. Columbus have work to do. Their immediate task is to host high-flying Colorado at Mapfre Stadium. The Rapids are on a roll, and their 1-0 win over Sporting KC was their sixth out of six at home. Dillon Serna\u2019s second-half goal sealed victory on Wednesday, and the Rapids now occupy the top spot in the West. Head coach Pablo Mastroeni watched his side struggle for large parts of the game, but he isn\u2019t concerned about the quality of the performance: he just wants to keep winning. \u201cMore than anything else, these midweek games are a test of character, a test of mentality,\u201d Mastroeni said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a team here that want to keep winning and today was a great performance in that it\u2019s not always going to come away as aesthetically [pleasing] as you\u2019d like. But this is not a beauty contest. It\u2019s about winning and they got the job done.\u201d FC Dallas happy to be home against Seattle It was tense, and for a while it looked as though it wasn\u2019t going to come, but Dallas finally ended their scoring drought and got their first win in four. Their 2-1 home victory over Portland on Wednesday night was far from pretty, but it was certainly welcome. Dallas have another Cascadia test at the weekend, against Seattle. The Sounders didn\u2019t play in midweek, but they\u2019ve been much improved with four wins in the last six, thanks in large part to the blossoming relationship between Clint Dempsey and Jordan Morris. Erik Friberg managed an assist against San Jose last week, and the Swedish midfielder\u2019s return coincided with Seattle\u2019s best display of the season, but he rejected the notion that Seattle, having not played in midweek, have the edge for this one.   Related: Clint Dempsey learns to love again and Crew fall apart over penalty    \u201cNo, not really,\u201d Friberg said after practice on Wednesday. \u201cThey play at home. They\u2019ve been struggling a little bit away. So I think they\u2019re going to be excited to play at home. It\u2019s a good team. We talked a lot about keeping the ball. They sit in different areas and have some very good counter-attacking players.\u201d Chicago still rock bottom as they travel to New England It looked as though Chicago would be heading back from Vancouver on Wednesday night with at least a point. Blas P\u00e9rez gave Vancouver the lead in the first half as the Chicago defence stood and watched, but Kennedy Igboananike levelled after a series of stepovers that left Jordan Harvey on his backside. Chicago might have even nabbed a winner as the second half grew end-to-end \u2013 Igboananike was denied by a combination of David Ousted and the post \u2013 but then three minutes from time, Vancouver attacked, Chicago couldn\u2019t clear, and Perez notched his second with a spectacular overhead kick. Two-one to the hosts, and Fire coach Veljko Paunovic was left to rue a missed opportunity. The Fire remain at the bottom of the standings with just one win and seven points from their first eight games, and this weekend they\u2019re on the road again, on the other side of the continent in Massachusetts. Their trip to New England arrives at an inopportune time, after MLS\u2019s draw specialists needed to turn those ties into victories, and they hope they\u2019ve found the man to that in Kamara. Last season\u2019s top scorer, and a man whose 79 career goals are second most among active MLS players, trails only San Jose\u2019s Chris Wondolowski, who has 116. On the face of it, it looks like a great signing for the Revs. \u201cWe have been looking to strengthen our team and we feel that this addition accomplishes just that,\u201d Revs GM Michael Burns said. \u201cKei is a player who has had success and is a proven goalscorer in MLS. We\u2019re pleased we were able to get this deal done and look forward to Kei\u2019s arrival and integration into the team.\u201d It certainly whets the appetite up front for the Revs, but how is Jay Heaps going to accommodate everyone? It\u2019s something of a crush in the attacking positions, and one of Juan Agudelo, Teal Bunbury and Charlie Davies might have to miss out. Finishing has been an issue for the Revs: they\u2019re third in the league in chances created, but 13 goals in 11 games tells its own story. If player and club can mesh, Saturday could represent the start of a new and exciting era in New England.  Orlando without suspended coach for trip to Sporting Orlando need to stop getting their staff suspended. Antonio Nocerino missed his team\u2019s game against the Red Bulls in April for stepping on to the pitch to celebrate Kevin Molino\u2019s stoppage time equaliser against New England, and now coach Adrian Heath has been banned, too, for entering the field to retrieve a wayward ball against the same opponents last week. Heath, the former Everton and Stoke City striker, will have no contact with the team after arriving at Sporting Park for the Lions\u2019 game on Sunday. The rules for such an innocuous offence are severe, it\u2019s true, and occasionally MLS doesn\u2019t help itself with its rush to officiousness, but coming on to the pitch is a red line for coaches and substitutes. Orlando need to impose some self-discipline. \u201cI\u2019m sure when the rule was made up about entering the field of play, it wasn\u2019t for this particular reason,\u2019 Heath said. \u201cI just tried to get the ball off as quickly as possible to carry on. I would think they\u2019ve got other things to worry about \u2026 somebody walking three strides on to the field to get a stray ball off, but obviously not.\u201d Sporting KC probably should have beaten Colorado on Wednesday, but they ended up on the wrong side of a 1-0 scoreline, and their winless run now stands at seven. On Monday, after their anaemic 2-0 defeat at Houston, the club held a \u201cteam meeting\u201d to \u201cdiscuss ways to improve\u201d \u2013 or, if you\u2019re of a more cynical mind, to point the finger and cast around for a scapegoat. Alas, the clear-the-air talks didn\u2019t seem to make any difference in Denver, although they were unlucky with the dismissal of Ike Opara for two yellow cards. Dillon Serna\u2019s winning goal came 12 minutes from the end and just two minutes after Opara\u2019s ejection. KC\u2019s form has really tailed off after a three-wins-from-three start, and their 4-2-6 record is that of classic mid-table dross. Eleven goals from 12 games suggests Vermes knows what the problem is. More is required from Dom Dwyer and Brad Davis. Top two meet in the East as Philadephia go to Montreal The best game in midweek came at PPL Park. Philadelphia and LA Galaxy shared a 2-2 draw in a pulsating match that featured excellent goals from Robbie Rogers and Mike Magee, one debut strike by Keegan Roseberry, and a bad handling error from LA keeper Dan Kennedy. Philadelphia kept at it after going behind, and gained a deserved point against the league\u2019s most potent side. They\u2019re second in the Eastern standings, and they go to Montreal this weekend in a top-of-the-table encounter that\u2019s difficult to call.            Montreal didn\u2019t play in the week, so they\u2019ve had seven days to digest their 4-4 draw against Columbus last weekend. What a bizarre game that was: Montreal were 4-1 down early in the second half, but scored two in a minute, and found an equaliser in stoppage time after Columbus failed to deal with a long throw. The man to thank for the Impact was Ignacio Piatti, named MLS player of the week fora two-goal, one-assist display at the Mapfre. His first strike was a corker \u2013 a delicious turn and shot frmo the edge of the box \u2013 and his second wasn\u2019t bad, either: he can add them to his ever-growing list of superb goals this season. Piatti\u2019s contribution wasn\u2019t lost on his team-mates. \u201cWhen he\u2019s in top form, he\u2019s one of the best players in the league,\u201d said Impact captain Patrick Bernier after the game. \u201cIf he keeps it up like that, for sure he\u2019ll be a candidate for player of the year.\u201d Montreal had been talked of as a possible destination for Kamara, in the wake of last week\u2019s tantrum, but midfielder Marco Donadel is fine that such a move never materialised. \u201cWe have a lot of good strikers and I don\u2019t think right now Kamara can give us anything different,\u201d Donadel said. \u201cWe\u2019re OK. There is a big guy here, no?\u201d",
