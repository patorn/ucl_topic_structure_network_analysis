Dench! Gambon! Him out of Downton Abbey! Benedict Cumberbatch as history\u2019s most swoonsome Richard III! But does anyone actually know the Henry VI plays? Most of us are on nodding terms with Falstaff and Hal, and even David Cameron is able to\u00a0spout the French-bashing bits from Henry V. But theatres rarely stage the first tetralogy. They haven\u2019t been seen on the Beeb since the woebegone Complete Works series of the late 1970s and early 80s. Navigating the\u00a0Henry VI plays, with their multiplying Warwicks and Worcesters, Somersets and Shrewsburys, is like taking a tour through minor English cathedral cities by means of Blackadder and 1066 and All That. So here are five useful facts about the plays. Meet the Henrys. They\u2019re more fun than you might think. The three Henry VI plays were Shakespeare\u2019s first big hits      Joe Armstrong, right, as Hotspur in Henry IV Part I. Photograph: Joss Barratt/BBC    Though they depict historical events that come after Henry IV Parts I and II and Henry V, the Henry VIs were composed earlier, possibly when Shakespeare was in his mid 20s. He may have begun with the script initially known as The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster (Part II) and The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke (Part III), both of which were on stage by 1592. Part I possibly followed as a prequel the same year. His answer to the nationalistic history plays staged by the Queen\u2019s Men, a\u00a0touring troupe of the late 1580s, was also an attempt to trump Christopher Marlowe\u2019s two-part Tamburlaine the Great (c1588). The ploy worked: Thomas Nashe reported that \u201cten thousand spectators\u201d were reduced to tears by the death of the heroic English soldier Talbot in Part I, while the playwright Robert Greene was so discomfited by Shakespeare\u2019s success that he parodied a line from Part III to undermine him (\u201can upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his / Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde / \u2026 is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene\u201d). They play fast and loose with history  Shakespeare took considerable licence portraying the Wars of the Roses. He plundered his main sources, Raphael Holinshed\u2019s Chronicles and Edward Halle\u2019s Union of the Two Noble and Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York for colourful detail, but didn\u2019t hesitate to change events. The scene in Part I in which the rival factions pluck red and white roses is fictionalised, characters\u2019 ages and motivations are tweaked, historical incidents are conflated or compressed; and though King Henry VI is depicted as a weak-willed martyr whose innocence loses France and the crown \u2013 several times \u2013 reality is shadier. There\u2019s some very clunky writing \u2026      Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff in Henry IV Part II Photograph: Joss Barratt/BBC    Shakespeare, perhaps collaborating with others, doesn\u2019t always avoid the tub-thumping style of earlier chronicle plays, or their pro-Tudor historiography. The power-hungry Duke of York, father of the future Richard III, has some really lumbering lines (\u201cMy brain, more busy than the labouring spider, / Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies\u201d). Equally, the melodramatic Battle of Towton scene in Part III in which a son discovers he\u2019s killed his father, and a father his son, tries both patience and credulity. The Beyond the Fringe send-up (\u201cO saucy Worcester, dost thou lie so still?\u201d) is not a million miles from reality. ... but some superb characters, particularly women      Sophie Okonedo as Margaret in Henry VI Part II Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC    Margaret, a proto-Lady Macbeth, armour-plated but driven by inner torment; Joan la Pucelle in Part I, Shakespeare\u2019s Joan of Arc, a messianic firebrand who makes the men around her look spineless: the silky Suffolk, who conducts an affair with Queen Margaret in full view of her husband; Gloucester, well meaning but undone by machinations at court; Jack Cade, the Farage-like leader of a Kentish rebellion in Part II who promises free beer for all and the torching of schools. Richard III is where we\u2019re heading      History\u2019s most swoonsome Richard III \u2026 Benedict Cumberbatch. Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC    Dramatically and historically, the climax of the tetralogy is Richard III, Shakespeare\u2019s first mature masterpiece. What\u2019s interesting is how he lays the groundwork: the dynastic quarrelling, the gory cycles of revenge and counter-revenge. The sense that a nation\u2019s destiny hangs in the balance \u2026 a bit like our waiting for the possibility of Brexit. Watching Richard III without watching the Henrys is like going to dinner and missing everything but pudding. Enjoy, and try not to get blood on the carpet. \u2022 The Hollow Crown: The Wars of Roses begins with Henry VI Part I tonight on BBC2.
