  "body": "Striding purposefully and talking at 100mph, Peter Hyman leads me round School 21, opened in 2012 in one of London\u2019s most deprived areas, a stone\u2019s throw from the Olympic Park and Stratford International railway station. He shows me extraordinarily lifelike clay models of leading figures from the cold war, such as Stalin, Gorbachev, Thatcher and Reagan; a graphic novel of the second world war; a diary of the Black Death; 3D representations of chemical reactions. All these were produced by School 21\u2019s pupils and he invites me to guess the age group; each time, I overestimate by at least two years. Then he whisks me into a year 10 assembly where I expect him, the headteacher, to address pupils sitting in silent rows. Not a bit of it. The pupils do 98% of the talking, sitting in groups to discuss plans for the school sixth form (which will open next year) and then choosing representatives to present their conclusions in one-minute speeches.   Related: Tony Blair's adviser starts a free school    Hyman, once a Downing Street aide to Tony Blair, invented the phrase \u201cbog-standard comprehensive\u201d. Or so it is said; he admits only to taking part in a discussion where the term \u201ccame up\u201d. New Labour was announcing the introduction of specialist schools and Alastair Campbell, Blair\u2019s press supremo, briefed journalists that they meant \u201cthe end of the bog-standard comprehensive\u201d. David Blunkett, then education secretary, later recalled that \u201cthe world just erupted\u201d with every comprehensive teacher and parent deeply offended. The idea of specialist schools never quite recovered. Perhaps it was as a kind of penance that, under the Tories\u2019 free schools programme, Hyman, now a qualified teacher, set up School 21 (a school for the 21st century, geddit?). Though indisputably a comprehensive \u2013 Hyman gave control over admissions to Newham council \u2013 it is the opposite of bog standard. Taking children aged four to 18, it is the only specialist school for English language. Teaching groups vary from \u201cseminars\u201d of 12 to lectures for 50. Pupils are never naughty, just \u201cunprofessional\u201d; for lateness, lack of homework and classroom disruption, they lose some of the 50 \u201cprofessionalism points\u201d with which they start each week. Children are encouraged to talk constantly, inside and outside classrooms. \u201cSome heads purr with delight when their schools are silent,\u201d Hyman says. \u201cI take it as a sign that students aren\u2019t learning, thinking or deliberating.\u201d Hyman has several big ideas but oracy is his biggest. Grievously neglected by schools, it is as important a skill as reading, writing and maths, he argues. Employers put good oral communication first among applicants\u2019 desired attributes but, in inner-city lessons, the average child speaks fewer than four words. He wants to make the monosyllabic teenager extinct. His year 7 pupils learn how to construct an argument, put questions, control their breathing, hold eye contact, and listen and respond to what others are saying. At the end of the year, each child gives a five-minute speech without notes to teachers, parents and fellow pupils. Another big idea is \u201cauthenticity\u201d. Children\u2019s work should have a purpose: a drama that can be performed, a design that can be used for a new classroom. \u201cAs a parent myself,\u201d says Hyman, \u201cI know that secondary school pupils rarely bring anything home except test results. The implicit message is that school is just about fitting them for what comes after. It is as though education is some kind of grind you undergo before you begin real living. It makes schools joyless places.\u201d Doesn\u2019t the emphasis on talk, project work and joy, plus some of Hyman\u2019s other enthusiasms such as \u201cwellbeing\u201d, mean to a return to the reviled 1960s? \u201cThere\u2019s a very sterile debate about progressive versus traditional. We do some things very traditionally: children learn to read with synthetic phonics, they learn grammar. Knowledge and cultural literacy are important; I don\u2019t believe you can learn everything on the internet. But most schools pursue knowledge at the expense of character development and skills development.     A list of commitments for School 21\u2019s pupils. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    \u201cWhat will be left for humans when the robots arrive? It\u2019s obvious: creative jobs, jobs that need empathy, jobs where you\u2019re generating ideas, jobs where you\u2019re problem solving. All these are undervalued in schools.\u201d Hyman was a backroom boy during Blair\u2019s glory years. He invented \u201cthe grid\u201d, an advance diary designed to ensure not only that important departmental announcements didn\u2019t clash with each other but also that they weren\u2019t overshadowed by big sporting and cultural events. He helped to revise Labour\u2019s clause IV, replacing \u201ccommon ownership of the means of production\u201d with \u201cpower, wealth and opportunity \u2026 in the hands of the many, not the few\u201d. He wrote much of Blair\u2019s \u201cforces of conservatism\u201d speech in 1999, which, as Hyman put it in his book 1 Out of 10 (2005), was \u201cTony\u2019s first ever attempt to give the right a serious pounding\u201d. As you talk to Hyman or read what he says to others, you are reminded of Blair\u2019s speeches. The soundbites roll off the tongue \u2013 \u201cwe need to re-professionalise the teaching profession\u201d, \u201cthe 20th century was about rows, the 21st century is about circles\u201d \u2013 but you wonder about the substance. When Ofsted visited in 2014, however, the school was rated \u201coutstanding\u201d in every area and described as \u201can exciting place to learn\u201d where pupils developed \u201cextraordinary skills in listening, speaking and questioning\u201d. Parents are also impressed: there are almost nine applicants for each place. Hyman comes from an impeccably left-liberal background. He was born in 1968 to a north London Jewish family. His maternal grandparents fled Vienna with their children when the Nazis took over in 1938. His father was a publisher. The Jewish faith, with its values of service and fairness, is important to him, as it was for his parents and now for his three children, who all attend state schools, and for his wife, a manager at Age UK. Hyman went to University College School in Hampstead, a fee-charging but liberal day school that abolished corporal punishment in the 19th century. He hesitates when I ask if he enjoyed it. \u201cIt made us question and think,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was a bit formulaic and traditional. I probably wasn\u2019t stimulated as much as I should have been.\u201d His A-level results were mediocre. Until he was 14, sport, particularly cricket, obsessed him. Then, seeing Margaret Thatcher rampant after the Falklands war, he was \u201cenergised by politics\u201d. After taking a first in history at Bristol University, he wanted to become a campaigning journalist. He completed a graduate journalism course and landed jobs on Sky and BBC TV programmes. Soon though he moved into politics, working first for Gordon Brown, then shadow chancellor, and later for another shadow minister, Donald Dewar, before joining Blair\u2019s team in 1994. Hyman always worried that Blair was apt to drift too far from Labour\u2019s roots. \u201cHis view was that if he wasn\u2019t emphasising the \u2018new\u2019 bit of New Labour, very few others would. Some of us warned that it was politically damaging just to go for the stuff that wound Labour people up.\u201d But, says Hyman, there was no moment of disillusion. He left Downing Street in 2003 wanting \u201cto be in the frontline\u201d.   Related: How I went from Tony Blair's adviser to free school head | Peter Hyman    He chose a \u00a3300-a-week job as a teaching assistant at Islington Green comprehensive in north London, one of the local schools Blair rejected for his children in favour of the London Oratory, a Roman Catholic comprehensive with an elite intake. As he recalled in his book, Hyman found \u201ca world stained by deprivation \u2026 filled with expletives and trouble\u201d. Undaunted, he qualified through a fast-track scheme at another London comprehensive \u2013 \u201cI suffered constant humiliation in front of classes that were eating me alive\u201d \u2013 and, after moving elsewhere, speedily found a deputy headship. School 21 allowed him to put into practice ideas that had long bubbled in his mind. Hyman does not strike you as a man afflicted by regrets or self-doubt. But he has learned, as he puts it in 1 Out of 10, \u201chow the approach I had been part of creating, to deal with 24-hour media and to demonstrate a decisive government, was entirely the wrong one for \u2026 ensuring successful delivery\u201d. Politicians are desperate to show \u201cmomentum\u201d with new ideas, big and small. Real \u201cdelivery\u201d, Hyman has discovered, \u201cis about the grind, not just the grand\u201d. He tells me: \u201cAs head, I spend a lot of time trying to bat away, ameliorate, ignore government initiatives. There is too much activity and too much one-size-fits-all: with 24,000 schools, the same things can\u2019t possibly apply to them all. The greater the distance I\u2019ve travelled from government, the more sceptical I\u2019ve become about how it operates.\u201d Sadly, politicians show no sign of heeding that message and, as Hyman says, it\u2019s difficult to imagine them ever doing so. But perhaps, instead of recruiting 24-year-old history graduates as advisers, they could start by hiring people with experience on the public service frontline.
