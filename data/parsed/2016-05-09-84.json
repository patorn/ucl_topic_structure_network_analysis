But it comes at a huge cost; mentally, emotionally and physically.\u201d Writing anonymously on feminist website the Vagenda, Tammy says: \u201cMy body was ruined, I had to have surgeries later in life to repair what was done to me by forcing an almost 9lb child through my body. And worse yet, it seems as though expressing this honestly makes me a monster ... It seems as though your entire self becomes nothing more than a functional enabler for your kids\u2019 success.\u201d So why do women regret having children? \u201cMotherhood is no longer an all-encompassing role for women now, it can be a secondary role, or you don\u2019t have to choose it,\u201d says Toni Morrison in Andrea O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Motherhood: A\u00a0Politics of the Heart. But, she adds, \u201cIt was the most liberating thing that ever happened to me.\u201d For Morrison, and countless others, \u201cthe children\u2019s demands on me were things that nobody ever asked me to do. To be a good manager. To have a sense of humour. To deliver something that somebody could use. And they were not interested in all the things that other people were interested in, like what I\u00a0was wearing or if I were sensual. If you listen to [your children], somehow you are able to free yourself from baggage and vanity and all sorts of things, and deliver a better self, one that you like.\u201d   Related: Becoming a parent is the greatest identity change we go through    Across cultures and continents, society projects this ideal of motherhood, placing a premium on why mothering matters so much, with a list of things mums must not do: smoke, have casual sex, work instead of taking maternity leave. The biggest taboo, however, is when a mother says that she regrets becoming one at all. Which is why the debate around viral hashtag #regrettingmotherhood has become so intense in recent weeks. It started with Orna Donath, an Israeli sociologist who decided not to have children and was fed up with being considered an aberration in a country where women have, on average, three children. Last year, Donath published a study based on interviews with 23 Israeli mothers who regret having had children. In it she argues that while motherhood \u201cmay be a font of personal fulfillment, pleasure, love, pride, contentment and joy\u201d, it \u201cmay simultaneously be a realm of distress, helplessness, frustration, hostility and disappointment, as well as an arena of oppression and subordination\u201d. But the purpose of this study was not to let mothers express ambivalence towards motherhood, but to provide a space for mothers who actually have \u201cthe wish to undo motherhood\u201d, something that Donath describes as an \u201cunexplored maternal experience\u201d. Donath\u2019s study sparked a stormy debate. In Germany alone, novelist Sarah Fischer published Die Muttergl\u00fcck-L\u00fcge (The Mother-bliss Lie), with the subtitle Regretting Motherhood \u2013 Why I\u2019d Rather Have Become a Father; writers Alina Bronsky and Denise Wilk analysed the irreconcilable realities of Germany\u2019s traditional mother image and modern-day demands of working environments in their book The Abolishment of the Mother; while leading German columnist Harald Martenstein wrote that these \u201cmotherhood regretters\u201d are committing child abuse if they confront their own children with their negative feelings about motherhood (even if they also say that they love their children, as most of these mothers do). To Martenstein, regretting motherhood is the result of naive black-and-white thinking: a product of unrealistic expectations, the wrong partner, the mother\u2019s personality and perfectionism. To him, it\u2019s as pointless as crying over spilt milk.     \u2018I thought it was what I wanted. Society told me it was what I wanted, right?\u2019 Photograph: Fuse/Getty Images    \u201cThe ideological impetus to be a mother,\u201d as Donath describes it, can be found across all walks of society and is founded on the powerful conception that complete female happiness can only be achieved through motherhood. Those who seek to challenge this narrative face overwhelming opposition, which makes an honest, open debate difficult. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that mothers who regret the maternal experience almost always stress that they love their children. Donath speaks of the ideological promises made to prospective mothers about the joys of raising children, and of the \u201csimultaneous delegitimisation of women who remain childless\u201d, who are reckoned to be \u201cegoistic, unfeminine, pitiful and somehow defective\u201d.

No doubt someone will try to convince me it is, just like unhappy Victorian ladies were labelled as mentally ill when they were desperately unhappy with the lives society gave them. I am perfectly happy with my life, or rather, I was. My son is perfectly lovely, and my partner is extremely helpful. I adore them both. And, no, I wasn\u2019t pressured into it, either. I was in love with the idea. I\u00a0thought it was what I wanted. Society told me it was what I wanted, right?\u201d I am a mother, too, and while I don\u2019t regret it, I can deeply sympathise with women who feel betrayed by the eternal myth that enjoying motherhood is a biological predisposition. And I wonder if I would have chosen to be a mother had I not been indoctrinated all my life to believe that motherhood is the only thing that will\u00a0complete my happiness. I\u2019m not so sure. Donath\u2019s aim is simple: she wants to allow mothers to live motherhood as a subjective experience, one that can combine love and regret, one that will be accepted by society, no matter\u00a0how\u00a0it looks.",
