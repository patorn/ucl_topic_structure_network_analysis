  "body": "Leicester City will open talks over a new contract for Riyad Mahrez in the next couple of weeks in a bid to ward off interest for the PFA Player of the Year, although his agent has admitted there is a \u201c50/50 chance\u201d he could leave this summer. Mahrez, who joined Leicester in 2014 from the French side Le Havre for just \u00a3375,000, has attracted widespread attention from clubs in England and overseas after his performances in their remarkable title-winning season. The Algerian international has directly contributed to 28 of the goals scored by Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side this season and been linked with moves to Barcelona, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United.   Related: Claudio Ranieri deserves acclaim. He did more than just say the right thing | Paul Wilson    Mahrez still has three years to run of the contract he signed last August, in a deal which is believed to be worth around \u00a335,000 a week. Talks with Leicester over a new contract are scheduled to begin soon, with the club prepared to at least double that figure for a player who also finished second behind his team-mate Jamie Vardy in the Football Writers\u2019 Association Footballer of the Year. However, when asked whether his client could leave the King Power Stadium this summer, Mahrez\u2019s agent Kamel Bengougam said: \u201cYes of course there is a possibility. When you have been playing the way Riyad has this season it is bound to attract attention. He is very happy with Leicester and of course it has been a fantastic season. They will play in the Champions League next year as well so he would be happy to stay. \u201cBut at his age if the opportunity comes to play for a big team then we would have to think about it. I\u2019d say it\u2019s 50/50 at the moment whether he stays or goes.\u201d Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicester\u2019s vice-chairman, said this week that they are determined not to allow any of their star players to leave as they plan for the club\u2019s first season in the Champions League. In February, Ranieri warned that they could end up \u201ccarrying bags\u201d at bigger clubs if they leave but given the interest of some of European heavyweights in Mahrez and the midfielder N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, it could be difficult to resist. Kant\u00e9 is understood to have a \u00a319.6m release clause in his contract and has been linked with Chelsea, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain in the past. Mahrez has previously indicated he is happy to stay at Leicester but he has been watched several times this season by scouts from Barcelona. \u201cWe have interest from the UK and overseas,\u201d Bengougam said. \u201cWe will have to see what develops over the next few weeks.\u201d",
