  "body": "Is this a Jeremy Clarkson moment for education? An academy chain\u2019s director of education used the N-word in a meeting with senior colleagues and then laughed it off, its governing board has admitted. One of those present, who complained, then had to wait 10 months for news of any follow-up. Philip Cantwell, director of education at the 13-school Creative Education Trust (CET), used the word during a meeting last June at Weavers academy, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. Martin Titchmarsh, a former headteacher working for CET as a consultant, found the \u201cdeeply offensive language\u201d so \u201cshocking\u201d that he reported it to the chain\u2019s chief executive. \u201cI simply couldn\u2019t let it go. It was so \u2026 wrong,\u201d Titchmarsh told the Guardian. The incident occurred, said Titchmarsh, during a discussion about an Ofsted inspection, in the course of which Cantwell referred to the school\u2019s presentation of exam data as \u201cthe nigger in the woodpile\u201d. \u201cHe found it amusing. He laughed and said: \u2018I know, I know, it\u2019s my age.\u2019\u201d Titchmarsh said when he reported the incident to Marc Jordan, the chain\u2019s chief executive, Jordan responded that Cantwell\u2019s term was \u201cunacceptable\u201d but he would not say it was \u201cracist\u201d. The chief executive promised to keep Titchmarsh informed of the outcome of the complaint. After six months, frustrated at the lack of news, Titchmarsh wrote to CET\u2019s chairman, David Anderson, to raise the incident and Jordan\u2019s handling of it. The trust then set up an investigatory panel. In a letter to Titchmarsh last month, trustee Mary Groom, on behalf of the panel, writes: \u201cPhilip Cantwell accepts he used the phrase as described and that it should not be used. He has expressed deep regret that he has caused offence by the use of the words themselves and the nature of his response.\u201d The letter adds: \u201cOnce the offending words had been said \u2026 the response of Philip Cantwell and \u2013 once you made him aware of it \u2013 Marc Jordan, should have been more robust in acknowledging the racist nature of the incident and in taking appropriate follow-up action.\u201d Groom said a range of actions would be taken, including that \u201cappropriate steps are taken to increase awareness of diversity issues at both trustee and executive level\u201d. Titchmarsh says: \u201cI worked in schools as a teacher and headteacher for 37 years and never heard any member of staff use the word. Students, parents and staff of CET academies will be shocked that a senior officer of an academy trust \u2026 could use this racist language and then believe it amusing.\u201d In a statement, CET said it \u201crecognises that there is no place for racist language under any circumstances. We and the member of staff concerned deeply regret that an offensive and unacceptable racist term was used in a meeting on 3 June 2015. \u201cAs soon as a formal complaint was made in January this year, an internal investigation was carried out.\u201d Jordan had \u201creprimanded\u201d Cantwell after Titchmarsh first raised the alarm,\u00a0CET said.",
