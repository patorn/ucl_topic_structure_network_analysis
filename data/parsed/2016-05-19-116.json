  "body": "Punk icon Iggy Pop has praised the ease with which new technology enables musicians to be quickly remunerated while also expressing scepticism about its effect on creativity.  Speaking in Cannes ahead of the premiere a new documentary about the Stooges, he said: \u201cThe digital age has made collecting money so incredibly efficient. When we started our band we didn\u2019t know what publishing was. Now you can push a button and get rich quick.\u201d Yet he went on to caution against where such innovation might lead. \u201cIt might get to the point where it\u2019s going to grip everybody by the shoulders and shake us and then throw us down and get rid of us.\u201d     The Stooges in Jarmusch\u2019s Gimme Danger. Photograph: PR    While he likened analogue technology to \u201cthrowing an amp into the spirit of man,\u201d he grimaced as he mimicked a techno beat. \u201cIt\u2019s like: woah, you know! Why don\u2019t I just die now.\u201d Iggy recalled being on a beach recently when \u201ca big yob from Serbia\u201d approached to praise his music while also saying how much he enjoyed \u201cnew techno and electronic\u201d.  \u201cYou gonna be polite,\u201d said Iggy, recalling his response, \u201cbut then when the guy walks away you\u2019re gonna be like: \u2018Oh fuck you, Igor.\u2019\u201d  Gimme Danger is screening outside of competition at the festival: it marks the musician\u2019s third collaboration with director Jim Jarmusch, having previously acted in Coffee and Cigarettes and Dead Man.

Today, however, he said he goes no stronger than alcohol, and advocated the wider population adopt a similar approach. \u201cI don\u2019t drug up anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody should just drop that shit, simple as that. For me, the best is a very good wine \u2013 but weed is OK for most people.\u201d However, he warned smoking meant moving to harder drugs was more likely. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much before you\u2019re hearing: \u2018I got this mescaline.\u2019\u201d The musician said he was still considering defying his manager\u2019s command not to go shirtless on the red carpet, and that, at 69, he couldn\u2019t quite credit his continued good health. \u201cFor some reason I seem to have been able to regenerate from the various things I put into myself. Just by trying to take it easy or go to bed early.\u201d     Iggy Pop and director Jim Jarmusch in Cannes. Photograph: Loic Venance/AFP/Getty Images    He concluded by saying he hoped society at large would follow suit. \u201cThings are getting too wired up. In my lifetime, I\u2019ve seen the lakes and rivers get foul to the point where you can\u2019t drink the water and then you can\u2019t drink it out of the tap and you finally have to buy it. Everything\u2019s become a business. \u201cIf everyone could just calm the fuck down a little bit that would be good. There\u2019s a stimulation today that\u2019s really intense.\u201d",
