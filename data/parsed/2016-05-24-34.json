If you\u2019re governor of the Bank of England, it\u2019s best to remain good-humoured even when Jacob Rees-Mogg is prodding you in the ribs. But let\u2019s stick to what Carney and the Bank have actually said about Brexit. On the facts, they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. It would be odd if Threadneedle Street, with a mandate to promote monetary and financial stability, had nothing to say about a referendum that has potential consequences on both fronts. That was the context in which Carney set his warning last month that \u201ca vote to leave the EU could have material economic effects \u2013 on the exchange rate, on demand and on the economy\u2019s supply potential.\u201d His comment about sterling is a statement of the bleedin\u2019 obvious: you only have to observe how the currency markets twitch with opinion polls to appreciate the point. And, post-Brexit, speculation about the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU could surely dampen economic activity, if only because some companies would delay investment decisions. This is hardly mischievous political meddling on Carney\u2019s part, as Rees-Mogg thinks. Rather, it is an unremarkable economic analysis that many in the leave camp share. Some of those Brexiters argue the short-term pain would be worth it in the end \u2013 either because the UK\u2019s trade elsewhere would bloom, or because we would achieve greater distance from the dysfunctional eurozone. If Carney strayed into that territory \u2013 from either direction \u2013 he would have overstepped the mark. But he didn\u2019t. Meanwhile, Rees-Mogg\u2019s intended googly \u2013 why is the Bank talking now when it is silent during general elections? \u2013 didn\u2019t threaten the stumps. Referendums really are different: they are about single issues and their outcome is binding immediately. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, had it right when he said Carney & co would have had a harder time if they had taken \u201ca vow of omerta\u201d on the referendum. Quite. Let the Bank speak about risks \u2013 that\u2019s its job. Standard Life man makes stand against Shell auditor EY  Boardroom pay grabs all the attention in the corporate governance wars, so well done Guy Jubb of Standard Life for demonstrating there\u2019s more to it. Jubb has kicked up a fuss about Shell\u2019s appointment of EY \u2013 the former Ernst & Young \u2013 as its auditor. Standard Life voted against EY at Tuesday\u2019s meeting and collected some co-travellers. Around 7.5% of votes were cast against EY \u2013 not a big rebellion, but enough to spoil the usual 99%-plus majority enjoyed by auditors. Standard Life\u2019s complaint is that Shell\u2019s new audit partner at EY is the fellow who did the same job at recently acquired BG Group. That arrangement is obviously problematic: Shell has bet its future on the \u00a335bn takeover and now its lead auditor will be making judgments on assets that he had signed off in his last job. Objectivity could be impaired, argues Standard Life. Shell, naturally, argues that \u201cappropriate safeguards are in place\u201d and that potential conflicts of interest can be managed. Too fussy. Just get a fresh pair of eyes on the job. Hypersensitive Exxon bans Guardian from AGM Keep it in the ground, this newspaper has argued for ages on fossil fuels. Then keep out of our annual meeting, replies ExxonMobil. Or, to quote Exxon\u2019s media relations manager, Alan Jeffers: \u201cWe are denying your request [to attend Wednesday\u2019s meeting] because of the Guardian\u2019s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers.\u201d Corporate arrogance-cum-hypersensitivity on this scale is rare these days. One suspects Exxon\u2019s board is still cross that it has lost its battle to prevent resolutions on climate change being put to the meeting. The New York State Retirement Fund \u2013 backed by investors from around the world \u2013 has been allowed by the US Securities & Exchange Commission to table a proposal that would oblige Exxon to publish an annual assessment of the effect on its business of governments\u2019 policies to limit climate change. Oil industry rivals BP, Shell and Statoil have willingly supported and adopted similar proposals. Exxon, by contrast, seems determined to resist, just as it refuses to contemplate the possibility that some of its shareholders may sympathise with the Guardian\u2019s reporting and wish to read a firsthand account of the meeting.
