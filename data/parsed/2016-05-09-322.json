  "body": "Swing voters in the key parliamentary seat of Nuneaton told pollsters Jeremy Corbyn was \u201cold-fashioned\u201d and \u201cscruffy\u201d when they went to assess the party\u2019s prospects of seizing it back in 2020. The Warwickshire town fell to the Conservatives in 2010, and they held on to it at last year\u2019s general election, in one of the key indications that Ed Miliband\u2019s party was heading for defeat. Labour was cheered on Friday by news that it had held on to the local council in Thursday\u2019s local elections; but there was an 11% swing to the Conservatives compared with the last time the seats were contested. In research carried out for the firm Election Data, by Miliband\u2019s former pollster James Morris, two focus groups of former Labour voters who had switched to the Conservatives in 2010 or 2015 were asked to discuss their opinions about the government and the Labour party. Participants were unenthusiastic about the Conservatives \u2013 and about George Osborne, the potential future leader, who was described by one participant as \u201cslimy\u201d, and by another as \u201ca bit round and weaselly\u201d. Voters were keen to give Labour a chance, Morris and Election Data\u2019s Ian Warren found \u2013 but many also had a negative view of Corbyn. \u201cYou want a charismatic leader and to me he\u2019s more like Worzel Gummidge,\u201d one participant said. Another described him as \u201cscruffy, very scruffy and flaky-looking\u201d. Asked to write down the first words that sprang to mind when they thought about Corbyn, others said \u201cbeige\u201d, and \u201cold-fashioned\u201d.   Related: Jeremy Corbyn faces Labour MPs as Sadiq Khan calls for new tone    The findings are likely to reignite the debate within Labour about how best to chart a course towards victory at the next general election. Corbyn and his team reject the \u201cfocus group politics\u201d that they believe led to the political triangulation of the Blair and Brown governments, and spawned a generation of \u201cplastic politicians\u201d. But Morris and Warren say the public\u2019s inability to see Miliband as a potential prime minister was key to Labour\u2019s loss of last year\u2019s general election \u2013 and they warn that voters who are not firm Labour supporters appear to be even more wary of Corbyn. Morris said: \u201cThese focus groups are much more negative about Jeremy than the ones I conducted for Ed Miliband at a similar point in his leadership. Corbyn is failing to do any of the work needed to bring these voters back to Labour. They don\u2019t respect him, and what they know of his agenda they don\u2019t like. You only get one chance to make a first impression, and his is irredeemably negative.\u201d Voters have also noticed the internal dissent within the Labour party, a fact repeatedly highlighted by Corbyn\u2019s close allies in the runup to last week\u2019s votes. One participant said: \u201cIt\u2019s just a shambles, so how can you vote for someone to run the country when they can\u2019t even sit in the room together.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s allies hope that Labour\u2019s better-than-expected performance in the local elections will draw a line under the constant dissent in the parliamentary party, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell urging sceptics about his leadership to \u201cput up or shut up\u201d. Morris and Warren also found there was little recognition among voters of any of the potential challengers for the Labour leadership, with a list of names met with \u201cblank looks and almost complete silence\u201d.",
