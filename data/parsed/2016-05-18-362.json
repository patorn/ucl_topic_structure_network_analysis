  "body": "The Liberal party\u2019s Indi candidate, Sophie Mirabella, has been cut loose by the Coalition. The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has been openly mocking her and senior government sources claim she has been starved of Liberal party funding apart from that which she can raise locally. The developments suggest both sides of the Coalition have written off Mirabella\u2019s chances of regaining the seat from independent MP Cathy McGowan. Two days ago Mirabella accused some in the Liberal party of destablising her campaign on the ABC\u2019s 7.30.

If you want a friend in politics, get a dog \u2026 Let others be concerned about internecine affairs, I\u2019ll worry about Indi,\u201d Mirabella said. At a party event in Indi on Tuesday night for Nationals candidate Marty Corboy, Joyce told members and supporters the people of Indi wanted someone in Canberra who would allow them they say \u201cI feel proud of him\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk too much about the other candidates, they can talk for themselves and they did an exceptionally good job of that last night [on 7.30],\u201d Joyce said. \u201cWhat I can say is the more they talk, the better you look Marty.\u201d Joyce\u2019s approach was in stark contrast to Warren Truss\u2019s campaigning in Indi before he retired as leader when he refused to nominate which Coalition candidate he would back. In January Truss was asked if visiting Nationals ministers would be advocating for Corboy or for Corboy and Mirabella. \u201cWell, you can be sure that the Coalition will work together,\u201d Truss said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll have Nationals ministers here, and they\u2019ll be seeking to engage Sophie in their itineraries, and there\u2019ll be Liberal ministers here and they\u2019ll be seeking to engage Marty in their programs.\u201d  After Joyce opened Corboy\u2019s office, he fielded questions about Mirabella. Asked whether the Liberal candidate had \u201ccooked\u201d her campaign, Joyce said \u201cwhat has she done this time?\u201d  \u201cOn all these things, I will let the other candidates speak for themselves. I want to present the National party candidate.\u201d Joyce spent Tuesday campaigning in Indi where he rallied National party supporters, suggesting Corboy was a future leader. \u201cIf we start now in Indi, we know we can bed him down and the return will be great to this seat,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cWe can say I know we have planted someone in Canberra who is going to grow into a leader within Victoria and a leader within our nation.\u201d The Nationals leader, who faces a challenge from Tony Windsor in his own seat of New England, called on the independents to reveal which major party would get their support in the case of a hung parliament because \u201cit is the right of every voter to know\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t say to anybody if I go to the market, I don\u2019t know whether I am going to get a Holden or a horse or a camel or a house or a swimming pool,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people deserve the respect of knowing which way their vote is going to go.\u201d On Wednesday Joyce will campaign in the neighbouring electorate of Murray, in another three cornered contest after Liberal MP Sharman Stone has retired. The Nationals candidate Damien Drum is up against Liberal candidate Duncan McGauchie, son of the former chairman of Telstra Donald McGauchie. Drum has been dogged by reports that he had continued to take his $3,340-a-week Victorian parliamentary wage despite actively campaigning for the federal seat of Murray. Drum has reportedly not quit the state job since winning preselection. Joyce will also meet dairy farmers after Murray Goulburn and Fonterra cut their milk prices leaving producers owing thousands of dollars after the cuts were backdated to the beginning of financial year. Usually contracts start on a lower price and \u201cstep up\u201d rather than step down. Joyce told the ABC on Wednesday that government support would include changes to the farm household allowance which provided a cash payment of $1,000 a fortnight for up to three years. He foreshadowed changes to concessional loans to \u201cbetter fit\u201d the needs of dairy farmers.

The cooperative\u2019s managing director, chief financial officer and three directors have since resigned. Joyce said the ACCC was investigating \u201cserious questions\u201d regarding Murray Goulburn\u2019s \u201cwarrants\u201d on prices to dairy farmers. He said while global prices were a problem with oversupply in Europe, Asia had seen exponential growth. Mirabella\u2019s office has been contacted for comment.",
