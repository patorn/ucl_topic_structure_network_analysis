  "body": "Boris Johnson does not seem to understand the difference between fact and fiction, Chris Patten, the former Conservative party chairman, has said. Lord Patten told BBC Newsnight on Friday that Johnson made up stories and repeatedly changed his mind, and that after the EU referendum he needed to be tested in a \u201cproper\u201d cabinet job so that people could establish \u201cwhether there is something behind all the jokes\u201d. Johnson, the Conservative MP and former mayor of London, has faced a barrage of criticism since he started acting as the lead campaigner for Vote Leave. It has focused on the accuracy and appropriateness of his comments about the EU, but in some respects Patten\u2019s comments are the strongest yet from a fellow Tory, because he depicted Johnson as untrustworthy. Patten said: \u201cBoris just makes it up as he goes along, and you come across people like that. There\u2019s a sense in which you can\u2019t call Boris a liar. I think he\u2019s one of those people in life who simply doesn\u2019t really understand the difference between fact and fiction.     Boris Johnson is surrounded by Vote Leave and Vote Remain activists. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA    \u201cIf he\u2019ll make a good joke by saying something, or if he can write a newspaper article by referring to Hitler and the European Union, he does it, and he doesn\u2019t think about it, but he\u2019ll be saying the opposite in a few months\u2019 time.\u201d Patten, who became a European commissioner after losing his Commons seat and is now chancellor of Oxford University, also said that \u201cone thing that is absolutely dependable is that, anything that Boris says, you can find him saying the opposite weeks or months ago\u201d. Patten suggested Johnson should be given a job like health secretary following the 23 June vote, so he could show whether he can be a serious politician. In his interview Patten also took a swipe at Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit justice secretary. When it was put to him that the two leading figures on the remain campaign, David Cameron and George Osborne, and the two leading figures on the leave side, Johnson and Gove, were all Oxford graduates, Patten commented: \u201cI\u2019m proud of two of them. I\u2019m not sure about the other two, particularly since their regard for the truth seems to be Alan Clark-like. They do seem to economise on the v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\u201d Patten also said it would be \u201cfall-on-your-sword time\u201d for Cameron if remain lost the referendum, meaning he would have to quit as prime minister.",
