  "body": "Lord Sugar, the Apprentice star who has just been hired as the government\u2019s new enterprise tsar, had previously been fiercely critical of George Osborne, it has emerged. Sugar, a former Labour peer who has been signed up by David Cameron and will launch a campaign to encourage young people to start their own business, said of the chancellor in a 2012 interview: \u201cI never rated him in the beginning. I don\u2019t know what his qualifications are to be chancellor, but we need someone in there who\u2019s got a handle on the economics \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is a reshuffle, but if I were David Cameron I would seriously think about it.\u201d The comments were revealed by shadow business secretary Angela Eagle after she face Osborne across the House of Commons for prime minister\u2019s questions.

Related: Alan Sugar resigns from Labour party over 'shift to left'    Sugar said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be taking on this challenge. I\u2019ll be travelling the length and breadth of this country to tell young people why apprenticeships are a great way for them to build their skills \u2013 and talking about the opportunities for starting their own business, hopefully instilling some entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d Nick Boles, the skills minister, said: \u201cWe want every young person in Britain to get on and build a great life for themselves, whether it\u2019s by starting an apprenticeship or setting up their own business. Lord Sugar has huge credibility among young people and I am delighted that he has agreed to help the government bang the drum for apprenticeships and enterprise.\u201d Sugar is most famous for being the frontman of the BBC\u2019s The Apprentice, in which aspiring entrepreneurs compete to be granted investment in their business idea. The businesswoman Karren Brady, who is Sugar\u2019s assistant on the show, is a Tory peer. A statement from the government said Sugar\u2019s work would be supported by the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The peer becomes the latest former Labour supporter to be tempted by a job offer from Downing Street, after Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary, became chair of the national infrastructure commission. A number of other senior Labour figures have also carried out reviews of specific policy areas for the Conservatives, including the former health secretary Alan Milburn, who conducted a review of social mobility. Brown and Tony Blair spent years building up a closer relationship with business. But after the global financial crisis plunged Britain into recession, Ed Miliband shifted Labour\u2019s focus to protecting the consumer, with policies such as the energy price cap. Some of the contenders to succeed Miliband, including Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham, suggested the party should move closer to backing \u201cwealth creators\u201d, but they were soundly beaten by Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour leadership election.",
