  "body": "Joe Allen has admitted his Liverpool future is up in the air. The midfielder has one year remaining on his contract and his former club Swansea are monitoring the 26-year-old\u2019s situation on Merseyside. The Wales international held talks with the Liverpool manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, about his future in January when it was agreed his contractual situation would be discussed after Euro 2016. \u201cThere was a conversation with the club in terms of what the future did hold for me, if I would feature more or if I would feature in the plans moving forward,\u201d Allen said at Wales\u2019 training camp in Portugal. \u201cThey made it clear at that stage I wouldn\u2019t be moving anywhere. I knew where I stood and it was good to have that conversation and know that I had the second half of the season to look forward to with Liverpool.   Related: Liverpool turn focus to Southampton\u2019s Sadio Man\u00e9 after Mario G\u00f6tze failure    \u201cAs soon as the season finished with Liverpool I said to myself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to have any distractions and I am fully focused and engaged on purely all things Wales\u2019. That\u2019s where I am at the moment. We have had an intense season and I\u2019m sure there will be a week or two after the Euros before any discussions are had.\u201d Liverpool spent \u00a315m on Allen in August 2012 when Brendan Rodgers returned to his old club for the player he called the \u201cWelsh Xavi\u201d. Allen, however, has endured a mixed time at Liverpool but has won over supporters in the last few months under Klopp. Asked if his Liverpool future relied on the prospect of more first-team action, Allen replied: \u201cI think it hinges on the pre-season plans and what exactly the club are hoping to do, everything comes into that. The acquisitions and who they are going to get in. Until all that happens it is difficult to answer that question. \u201cAs a footballer you want to play every minute of every game. When you don\u2019t it can be disappointing. That\u2019s natural for anyone; that\u2019s not specific to me. It\u2019s how you react. You have to make sure you don\u2019t let it affect you to a point that, when you do get your chances, you\u2019re not up to it. \u201cWhat was great about the second half of the season was all the different competitions and how far we went. The support [from the fans] has been brilliant in the last few months. \u201cIt\u2019s always great for a player, it always helps you when you step out on the pitch. I\u2019ve enjoyed that and it made things easier. People have talked about the improvement in my game this year but it\u2019s almost a back-handed compliment in some ways. In the first half of the season I hadn\u2019t played. \u201cBut I\u2019m 26, not 36, so I am still developing and improving. I\u2019d be very disappointed if I said at the end of any year that I hadn\u2019t improved as the season had gone on.\u201d",
