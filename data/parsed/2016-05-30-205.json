  "body": "A scientist with a passion for peacock spiders \u2013 only a couple of millimetres long, extraordinarily colourful and \u201clike dogs or cats\u201d in their behaviour \u2013 has discovered seven new species. J\u00fcrgen Otto, a biologist from Sydney, has been researching the arachnids since 2005, and has gained a significant following online with his footage. He first came across one while walking in the Ku-ring-gai Chase national park, north of Sydney. \u201cI\u2019m always looking on the ground when I walk around, mostly for mites and other small things, and I almost stepped on this little spider. \u201cThat\u2019s what started my passion.\u201d   Related: Australian peacock spiders that behave 'like dogs and cats' \u2013 in pictures    A paper Otto co-wrote about the discovery of seven new species from Western Australia and South Australia was published in the international jumping spider journal Peckhamia on Sunday. He believes there are now 48 confirmed species of peacock spider within the Maratus genus, found across Australia but particularly in Western Australia \u2013 and many more awaiting confirmation.     Maratus vultus, one of the new species discovered by J\u00fcrgen Otto. Photograph: J\u00fcrgen Otto    The spiders are between three and five millimetres long and belong to the jumping spider family, which has tens of thousands of members. With their large eyes and almost mammalian characteristics, they look and behave differently to other spiders. Their bright colours and patterns form a key part of courtship rituals, as with peacocks and birds-of-paradise. \u201cThey\u2019re fairly cute, which is why people are attracted to them,\u201d Otto said. \u201cThey behave very differently to how people think a spider does ... they behave more like cats and dogs, moving around, perceiving and reacting to their environment.\u201d   Related: The false widow spider and the woodlouse    Otto maintains a Facebook page dedicated to the colourful arachnid, which has more than 61,000 followers. He also posts videos to his YouTube channel; one video has 5.4m views. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s important to document all of these spiders and their behaviour ... I just wanted there to be a public record.\u201d He has dedicated a spare bedroom to his \u201cspider work\u201d.  \u201cI wish it was larger, but it\u2019s not ... this hobby sort of consumes everything.\u201d Otto\u2019s day job is national mite expert for the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources.  \u201cBy comparison to mites, these spiders are actually quite large,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all relative.  \u201cIf you know what you\u2019re looking for, you can find them. But I have to be careful not to lose them \u2013 particularly the babies \u2013 and not to squash them.\u201d",
