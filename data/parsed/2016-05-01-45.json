  "body": "Last December\u2019s general election was supposed to give Spain \u2013 weary of austerity, fed up with scandals and tired of incumbents who seemed to have been around too long \u2013 a political new start. But the paradoxical result of the rise of two parties promising fresh approaches to the country\u2019s problems has been paralysis, not forward movement. After months of squabbling and manoeuvring, King Felipe last week gave up his efforts to persuade the politicians to agree on a coalition which could rule the country, and there will now be new elections in late June. The awkward arithmetic of the December vote meant that a coalition would only be possible if principles were sacrificed to practicality by one or more of the players. The trouble is that the compromises explored in the attempts to form a viable coalition diluted the very message which excited voters in December \u2013 that deals and fixes would become things of the past \u2013 yet the failure to agree confirmed the contrasting view that politicians were putting their own interests before those of the country. If there were an easy way out in the shape of the new elections then that could be a solution, but the polls suggest that although there will be some shifts in the share of votes, the next vote may well lead to another deadlock. It is obvious that neither the voters nor the parties, old and new, wanted this outcome. Voters for the two mainstream parties wanted\u00a0the familiar political balance and alternation that has characterised Spain since\u00a0the 1980s. Voters for the two upstart parties, Podemos and Ciudadanos, wanted different things. Podemos emphasised an end\u00a0to austerity, popular participation, and\u00a0an assault on neoliberalism. Just as Podemos represented an attempt to renew the left, Ciudadanos constituted an attempt at renewal on the right, with a particular stress on clean government. In 2006, the party launched a campaign in which its leader Albert Rivera appeared naked to emphasise the idea of a new, clean party being born. In the 2015 election both the new left and the new right did well, but the old left and the old right proved resilient, in each case gaining more votes than their rivals \u2013 many more, in the case of the ruling People\u2019s party. To quote a Podemos favourite, Antonio Gramsci, \u201cthe old is dying and the new cannot be born\u201d. The two left parties did not have enough seats to govern together; nor did the two parties of the right. The two old parties, the People\u2019s party and the Socialists, would have had the seats to govern, but refused to form a grand coalition. The Socialists could have joined with both the two new parties, but this threesome repeatedly failed to find enough common ground. The favourite Spanish word for the resulting muddle is circo, or circus. It is not as if Spain can afford to fiddle around for much longer in this way. The country urgently needs an agreement on Catalonia, where a separatist government has been pressing for an independence referendum. Only Podemos has been ready to consider the Catalan demand. Then there is austerity, opposition to which was the original trigger for Spain\u2019s new politics. It has not gone away, as recent Brussels warnings over Spain\u2019s growing deficit show. Somebody needs to be in charge if these and other pressing issues are to be tackled effectively, yet the prospects of that happening soon are not good.",
