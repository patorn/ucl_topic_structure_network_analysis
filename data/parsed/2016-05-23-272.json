  "body": "The only way England are going to win the football this summer is if they have the right anthem. It doesn\u2019t matter what Kane and co do on the pitch; if there isn\u2019t the right combo of B-list light entertainer and middle-of-the-road touring band doing a song called Come On (Mighty England)!, they may as well not bother. Even Wales have a legitimate banger this year: they\u2019ve got the actual Manic Street Preachers to record their song, and the video has Gareth Bale doing his best \u201clad who got dumped 18 months ago and finally feels free to love again\u201d impression pogoing along in the background, so England are already behind. Twenty years after Three Lions, here are a few pointers on how to update the tried-and-tested football song formula for a winning 2016. THE ODDEST SUPERGROUP KNOWN TO MAN            Not a day goes by when we don\u2019t all of us long for the days of England United \u2013 the supergroup of Spice Girls, Echo And The Bunnymen, Space and one of Ocean Colour Scene, who put out the 1998 England theme (How Does It Feel To Be) On Top Of The World? before disbanding, never to grace us with another single again. We need them back, desperately. Not with Space, though. Let\u2019s not bring Space back. Instead, craft together Little Mix, the gobshite one out of Catfish And The Bottlemen, Chico and, seeing as it\u2019s 2016, Disclosure. Then England will win the thing, surely.            LIGHT ENTERTAINERS IN NEWLY PURCHASED ENGLAND SHIRTS   Related: Manic Street Preachers release their Euro 2016 song Together Stronger    England have previous: Baddiel & Skinner, who started this whole thing; James Corden, who did the 2010 song with an embarrassed-looking Dizzee Rascal; Ant & Dec; Bubble and Dean from Big Brother 2 (both 2002). The form seems to be: take two people who are a bit famous, but yet to break through to actual megastardom. Like: they\u2019re on TV, but they also still really worry about the gas bill. The only sensible option is Stevi Ritchie and Chloe-Jasmine, the fiance and fiancee team who do the competitions on This Morning. LYRICAL OVERSTATEMENT OF HOW GOOD ENGLAND ARE AT FOOTBALL If you assessed England\u2019s sporting capability on audio evidence alone, they have for two decades been a footballing titan, crushing all in their path and/or consistently scoring one more goal than the opposition. The reality is there was a good five-year period there when they were genuinely reliant on Emile Heskey. Perhaps it\u2019s time to get real this year, eh? Getting Dappy in to do some guest bars about how \u201crealistically we\u2019ll probably make it to the second round and that\u2019s about it/ Maybe quarters at a push\u201d would help. HORRIBLE LIBERTIES TAKEN WITH A PRE-EXISTING SONG            Corden \u2019n\u2019 Rascal\u2019s Shout (Shout For England) was the worst offender, mangling the Tears For Fears classic with the addition of both a rap bit and patriotism, but the football song has always been the place that existing music goes to be slaughtered at the altar. This year, it seems inevitable: Uptown Funk but with English overtones (\u201cCos Wayne Rooney\u2019s gon\u2019 give it to ya / \u2019COS WAYNE ROONEY\u2019S GON\u2019 GIVE IT TO YA\u201d), sung by the NHS Choir. ANAEMIC, ENGLAND-CENTRIC SONG TITLE Aside from Vindaloo, every England song title is essentially the same combination of bloodless encouragement (the kind of thing a non-football fan would do after accidentally wandering into a pub during a game \u2013 saying \u201cshout for England!\u201d at the TV so they don\u2019t get chaired by hooligans) and some words in brackets. To cover all bases, this year\u2019s song should be called England, England (England, England, England). A DOOMED ATTEMPT BY A FOOTBALLER TO RAP            England needs to admit as a nation that, musically, it will never match John Barnes\u2019s bars from 1990\u2019s World in Motion. Since then \u2013 knowing they will never achieve such heights \u2013 producers have stuck to just getting the squad to mumble along to some sort of chanting backing track, dropping rapping footballers altogether. It\u2019s time for a change. It\u2019s time for Danny Drinkwater, in the biggest Beats By Dre headphones money can buy, to drop eight lines about how banter is the key to squad harmony. THE WORST MUSIC VIDEO OF ALL TIME England songs are only allowed to contain three visual elements: builders in hi-vis jackets crooning, people in a cafe looking alternately sad and hopeful, and lads doing double-clenched fists at the camera. The combined effect of these things is usually enough to make you think: \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t want them to win it.\u201d This year, imagine a Jamie Vardy lookalike with his arms around the shoulders of the three members of the Pigeon Detectives who agreed to this folly, while a stand with only 20 people in it attempts a Mexican wave. CONCLUSION Oh God, let\u2019s just re-record Three Lions again.",
