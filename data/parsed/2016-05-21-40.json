  "body": "Roy Hodgson feels England supporters should stop looking back and torturing themselves over some largely lacklustre tournament performances in the past, and begin to look forward with more optimism as a younger and more inexperienced squad prepares for this summer\u2019s European Championship in France. \u201cIt is true that only four of our players have more than 40 caps, so the squad is less experienced than the one we took to Brazil,\u201d the England manager said. \u201cSome of our players will be stepping out on to a major international stage for the first time, but maybe it is time to look forward now. We are certainly not going to France looking for revenge for 2014. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the players to be fearful. This group doesn\u2019t have baggage. They aren\u2019t weighed down by the sins of the fathers. That\u2019s what our message will be. We want to go to France with a good football team, play well, and win matches.\u201d   Related: England\u2019s Euro 2016 squad: the provisional 26 picked by Roy Hodgson    When it was suggested England often appeared to be behind the Germans and Italians in tournament strategy, the ability to stay in events for long enough to develop a playing style and impose themselves on opponents, Hodgson admitted he had only a limited grasp of what could be changed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what tournament strategy is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are concepts that are thrown out there, but for someone to say to me that the Germans and the Italians are good at this and you\u2019re not, I\u2019d have to know what is meant by the term. As far as I am concerned you either win games or you don\u2019t. Most football success boils down to winning games, and I don\u2019t think tournaments are any different.\u201d England went out early in Brazil two years ago with a squad expected to do much better, an almost brutally truncated experience that Hodgson clearly remembers only too well. \u201cI am confident now, but I was confident for Brazil,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe facts suggest tournaments are decided on results. If you survive the tournament it means you\u2019ve played well and if you don\u2019t it means you\u2019ve played badly. The football truth is probably in between those two scenarios. Had the ball not skidded off Gerrard\u2019s head and played Su\u00e1rez onside, had we gone on to win that game 2-1, had we then gone on to beat Costa Rica, we might have been talking about a great tournament. \u201cTournaments have their own life, their own stories, it is three cup finals and you can be lucky, you can be unlucky. All we can do is prepare the best we can and make certain we reduce the chances of something hazardous happening to us. As far as I\u2019m concerned 2014 was a very different set of players, much more mature and experienced as a group. I am going into this tournament with another group of players. I believed that the team in 2014 would go far and we didn\u2019t. I believe this team will go far, so let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d Gary Cahill, who will captain the side in Sunday\u2019s friendly against Turkey, believes Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy will be able to pose problems for most defenders, having seen their ability at close hand in the Premier League. \u201cI have heard both players referred to as pests, but they are actually huge threats to any defence,\u201d the Chelsea defender said. \u201cThey are both very sharp and they both work hard too. They have certainly produced in the Premier League this season. I think we are blessed with some top quality striking talent.\u201d Having invited his captain to speak for a few moments while he got his breath back Hodgson was not sure he liked the sound of that. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between having a good season in the Premier League and what\u2019s around at the top end of the international game,\u201d he interjected, perhaps fearful that his young strikers might get carried away with Cahill\u2019s praise. \u201cThese are young players making their first steps in a tournament, other countries have strikers who have done it all, if you think about Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Sergio Ag\u00fcero. I\u2019m just trying to be realistic. Jamie Vardy has had a great season but he will have to lift up a few more trophies before he can be compared to players of that stature.\u201d No one would argue otherwise, especially as Messi and Ag\u00fcero will not actually be appearing at Euro 2016. Hodgson is just being overprotective, as well as being careful not to take anything for granted. \u201cThe players I am working with are young, they are inexperienced, but they are playing a top level of football and they are playing against top level opposition every week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be argued that some of them will be better once they have got a tournament under their belts, but I think it would be wrong if we said this summer doesn\u2019t matter because it will only be a stepping stone. \u201cI do believe that a lot of these players will go on to future tournaments and be even better than they will be this time, but that belief doesn\u2019t alter our hopes, our ambitions and our dreams. It might be a bit unfair to put too much pressure on these players, they are not yet at the level of Messi or Ibrahimovic, they haven\u2019t got 100 caps. Most of them are at the start of their careers, and I am rather hoping they will be seen as players of potential, not as people who can right the wrongs of the last 40 years.\u201d",
