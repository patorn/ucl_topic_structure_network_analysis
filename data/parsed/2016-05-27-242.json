  "body": "Birmingham Social Workers - the sector will unite with you as one - you will not be divided in your mission to effect positive change :-)\u2014 Hackney Child (@HackneyChild) May 27, 2016      @GdnSocialCare no wider context regarding impact of austerity and resulting demand v capacity #dispatches\u2014 Ogmios (@Ogmios3) May 26, 2016      @GdnSocialCare it would be nice if there could be a programme to show some of the positive work social workers do as well to balance it out\u2014 Liz (@lizziey87) May 26, 2016      Ok, so far I'm not getting sense of SWs being trashed here - others may disagree! #dispatches More workload/management issues?? Let's see.\u2014 Suddenly Mummy (@suddenly_mummy) May 26, 2016      #Dispatches shows the difficult challenges #socialworkers have to overcome to protect #children. Easy to criticise based on hindsight\u2014 Chris Griffin (@Chrisgriff4453) May 26, 2016      Deeply worrying that #Dispatches are uncovering these problems but where is the #earlyintervention for families? Being left too late to act.\u2014 Dan Breslin (@Dan_Breslin17) May 26, 2016      My most valuable resource is informal peer supervision wonder how #Dispatches will impact on social workers trust to offload\u2014 Rachel Ross (@bakedbyrachross) May 26, 2016      So much to say about #dispatches but know this -categorisation isn't done in a financial vacuum. Context- austerity for SWrs, LA+families\u2014 Emilie Whitaker (@Dr_EmWhitaker) May 26, 2016      @GdnSocialCare of course it doesn't. We are half way through and red tape and stresses of social work haven't been mentioned. #blamegame\u2014 Kerri B (@KerriBerriB) May 26, 2016      #Dispatches thresholds have never been higher in the boro my schools are in. Schools v frustrated with SCs often slow response to concerns.\u2014 Maeve Begley (@MaeveBeg) May 26, 2016      #Dispatches already putting the blame entirely on children's services, multi-agency what now???\u2014 Emma Lake (@emmaalakeyy) May 26, 2016      Wonder if #dispatches allowed themselves to find any positives? Gd SW prac happens evryday even in these difficult circs.Same old rhetoric\u2014 Brydee Siobhan Lynch (@BrydeeSiobhan) May 26, 2016      Why is it never acknowledged how they save children's lives everyday. #Dispatches\u2014 Hannah Wallace (@HannahWallacex) May 26, 2016      This job is emotionally demanding - I'd be devastated if one of my colleagues broke my trust like 'Vicky' did in Birmingham #Dispatches\u2014 Gracie (@SWGracie) May 26, 2016      #Dispatches am I the only one concerned that these social workers did not agree or know about being filmed.\u2014 Tracey (@traceyjones706) May 26, 2016      #Dispatches tough watch for anyone proud to be a Brummie.Serious change needed but can't be done in culture of fear&constant gov budget cuts\u2014 Andy Reeve (@andyreevo) May 26, 2016      @GdnSocialCare @Channel4 @Dispatches #standupforsocialwork give us the big picture, not front line blame? What about the senior managers?\u2014 Emma Goodall (@emmafayegoodall) May 26, 2016      #dispatches criticise bham for use of agency staff yet coverage like this only lowers morale making retention even harder #socialwork\u2014 Brydee Siobhan Lynch (@BrydeeSiobhan) May 26, 2016      You study for 4 years, you work for a poorly reflective wage, you care endlessly for the children you work with - you never win. #Dispatches\u2014 Pseudonym (@fancehpanteh) May 26, 2016      Perhaps councils would not have to pay for agency workers if programmes like this did not deter potential SWers wanting to help. #Dispatches\u2014 Chloe Greenfield (@CGreenfield94) May 26, 2016      #Dispatches offering very little analysis or willingness to critically consider complexity of social work and child protection. #socialwork\u2014 SWSCmedia (@SWSCmedia) May 26, 2016      @GdnSocialCare biased account looking to blame #socialwork #dispatches no analysis about why recruitment/retention/supervision missing\u2014 Penny Sturt (@practicematters) May 26, 2016      @GdnSocialCare it reflected many of my own experiences. Just wish the senior management had the balls to say it how it is & not spin it\u2014 Swerdna (@SwerdnaKi) May 26, 2016      @GdnSocialCare I feel very let down that a colleague could betray confidences in this way. Unethical from \"Vicky\".\u2014 Oratorio (@oratorio_silver) May 26, 2016      @GdnSocialCare #Dispatches this is nothing more than propaganda and scapegoating SW's. Disappointing that they took this predictable angle\u2014 Dani Lou (@Danidreamer82) May 26, 2016    Join the Social Care Network to read more pieces like this.
