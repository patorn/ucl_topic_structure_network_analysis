  "body": "MAN OF THE DAY He was on the losing side but Yannick Carrasco got to score an equaliser in the Champions League final then race over to the crowd for a kiss from his girlfriend No\u00e9mie Happart, a model. Impressive \u2013 and for some the very definition of fantasy football.       BIGGEST VILLAIN Fair to say Pepe did not win too many fans with his theatrical approach. Gary Lineker\u2019s tweet calling him an \u201cenormous dick\u201d got 30,000 retweets in next to no time \u2013 and that was before Pepe produced a selfie-stick on the pitch for the celebrations. MODERN FOOTBALL \u2026 An overrunning \u2013 and possibly unnecessary \u2013 music act, a pitch-covering piece of cloth and a five-minute delay to the kick-off \u2026 San Siro repeated Wembley\u2019s FA Cup final trick of not focusing on the football and the game duly kicked off at 7.50pm BST, five minutes late. As @RobHarris pointed out, Uefa fined Manchester City \u20ac30,000 in 2012 for a delayed start to the second half of a Europa League game. Tut-tut.

Curious. BEST DRESSED Rio Ferdinand can thank BT Sport making the game free-to-air for an extra big outpouring of analysis of his punditry attire. At the polite end of the spectrum he was variously likened to James Bond, a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy, a cocktail waiter and a snooker referee. OVER ON ITV For years the Champions League final was ITV\u2019s big night but after BT\u2019s \u00a3900m three-year raid on the rights they were left to schedule the Britain\u2019s Got Talent final up against the football with Ant and Dec dressed like \u2026 well, dressed like Rio Ferdinand actually. MOST ANTICIPATORY Watching in Milan: a delegation of nearly 30 people from Cardiff. The Millennium Stadium hosts the next Champions League final, on Saturday 3 June 2017. For years the \u201cRoad to Cardiff\u201d has referred to the A48 via St Mellons \u2013 now it is a season-long journey for Europe\u2019s greatest.",
