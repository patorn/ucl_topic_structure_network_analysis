  "body": "My kitchen is \u2026 quaint. It\u2019s rather small and right in the middle of my 1900 farmhouse, with a dining room off of one end, and a breakfast nook off the other side in New England. Being the size it is, there\u2019s not much room for cute extras \u2013 it\u2019s more functional than charming. We have open shelving for our dishes, jars and vessels, and some artwork on the walls. We like barn wood and antique kitchen tools, with a touch of modern design, a juxtaposition of old and new. My favourite kitchen tool is \u2026 my stereo. I\u2019m often in the kitchen for hours at a time by myself. I listen to the news in the morning, podcasts later on and I usually end the day with a glass of wine and Whitney Houston, Shirley Bassey, or some Bollywood. My storecupboard staple is \u2026 maple syrup. Here in Vermont it\u2019s almost a rite of passage to tap a couple trees and make your own. Whenever we have a dinner party, it\u2019s pretty much garanteed someone will bring a bottle as a gift. Subsequently, almost everything I make starts with maple syrup \u2013 glazing a ham, making salad dressing, frying up a pork chop, baking bread. Just last night I made a spicy stir-fry with a splash. It\u2019s my go-to source of sweetness. When I\u2019m starving \u2026 I make something Mexican: enchiladas, tacos, even nachos (because we\u2019re grownups and we can have nachos for dinner!). We\u2019ve an endless supply of meat on the farm \u2013 we raise our own pork and poultry, as well as raising goats for milk \u2013 so as long as I have an avo and a lime, I can whip up a meal in a matter of minutes. We also always have our own lard, so I can always make authentic tortilla. My culinary inspiration is \u2026 the seasons. In fact, since we started farming, they\u2019re not just an inspiration \u2013 everything we eat is about the time of year. Right now it\u2019s ramps [wild leeks]; soon, it\u2019ll be asparagus and rhubarb, and then berries. We spent the winter eating potatoes, roots, meat \u2026 so we\u2019re ready for springtime greens. My best-kept kitchen secret is \u2026 the power of using good ingredients. A lot of people have a tendency to pick up a bargain. But \u2013 certainly in baking \u2013 good flour, organic dark chocolate, eggs from chickens that are well cared for, it all makes such a difference. My current obsession is \u2026 tarts.Not something you see in the States that much. I love how much more delicate they are, compared to pies. Right now, I\u2019m working on a rich buttery shell with a layer of soft caramel topped with dark chocolate ganache and pink Himalayan salt. Everything tastes better with \u2026 butter, of course \u2013 no explanation needed! I\u2019ve even been known to use melted butter in a salad dressing. When I go shopping I \u2026 am meticulous. And always, always with a list, organised by section, and aisle, wherever possible. It\u2019s the pastry chef in me. I don\u2019t think I ever divert from the list \u2013 unless avocados are on sale and the price and quality is right. For dinner tonight \u2026 we\u2019re having burgers, to celebrate the fact that it\u2019s the most beautiful day of the year so far. With roast potatoes and a cabbage salad.
