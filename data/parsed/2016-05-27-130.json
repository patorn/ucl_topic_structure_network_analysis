To his right, so did Diego Simeone. \u201cIt is the game of my life,\u201d Torres said. It is the game of all their lives. \u201cI love having 113 years of history on my shoulders,\u201d Simeone insisted. Atl\u00e9tico have never won the European Cup since its inception in 1956. Twice they have been seconds away from doing so but twice, in 1974 and 2014, it was denied to them late in the game. Torres has won it with Chelsea, scored the wining goal at Euro 2008 that took Spain to their first international trophy in 44 years and left South Africa with the World Cup in 2010, but he said: \u201cWithout doubt this is the most important, special and beautiful game in my life. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been an Atl\u00e9tico fan from the age of five, the chance to win this trophy with this club is different to anything else I have had. I have won [titles] with Chelsea and with the national team but it\u2019s different.\u201d Torres, first taken to the Calder\u00f3n by his grandfather, made his debut at 17, leaving for Liverpool in 2007 and returning an idol in January 2015, having won the greatest prizes in the game. When he scored his 100th Atl\u00e9tico goal in February, it came 15 years after his first; now he has the chance to win his first trophy for the club that in his absence won the Copa del Rey, La Liga, the Uefa Cup and reached the Champions League final. \u201cIt means everything; everything you dream when you are a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI now have the chance to make this dream come true. I\u2019ve been able to play for great teams and to win many things but this is special: it\u2019s what I wanted when I was a kid, more than I could even have dreamed. I had the chance to come back and fight for what I really wanted. Tomorrow is the game of my life without doubt.\u201d Back at San Siro too, where he spent the first half of 2014\u201115 on loan with Milan. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a magical place for Atl\u00e9tico fans from tomorrow, somewhere we can always look back upon with good memories,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople will come to support us and I hope they\u2019ll be part of a special night.\u201d Simeone has talked often about the importance of \u201cbelonging\u201d, of identification with Atl\u00e9tico. On the eve of the final, he was joined here by two players brought through the youth system, Atl\u00e9tico fans. Two more are likely to join them in the starting XI: Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez and Koke, who has a photograph from the day he met his hero, a kid of about 10 with Torres. Asked if he has dreamed of lifting the European Cup for Atl\u00e9tico, Gabi replied: \u201cYes, but not now: when I was a little boy.\u201d \u201cKoke [and] Sa\u00fal were kids when we were [first] in the first team together,\u201d Torres said, nodding towards Gabi. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely. It\u2019s important for [youth-team players] to get to the first team and transmit what this club is. We can tell those who arrive what it means to play for Atl\u00e9tico. Since I returned I\u2019ve learned what it means [now], too, from the people who\u2019ve been here in the last few years.\u201d   Related: Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid revel in affinity before European Cup final | Sid Lowe    Those are years in which history has been changed, but the European Cup resists and Lisbon 2014, also against Real Madrid, was cruel. Simeone, though, welcomed the pressure and Torres insisted: \u201cWe live in the same city, we know what Madrid represent and that gives us the desire to fight and to change history. This is a chance to write a page in the history of Atl\u00e9tico that no one has written, another step in what we have been doing over the last four years. History changes all the time and now we want to write it.\u201d To do so they must emerge victorious. After 40 years without making it, reaching two finals in three seasons is a gigantic achievement but there can be no satisfaction, nor consolation, in defeat. \u201cThere is nothing else that will leave me happy: only winning,\u201d Simeone said. Real\u2019s Madrid\u2019s Sergio Ramos said that if he could live the 2014 Champions League final over again, he would do it exactly the same way, after it took his dramatic stoppage-time equaliser to take the game into extra time in Lisbon and rescue a side who were seconds from defeat. He also praised Atl\u00e9tico for overcoming that disappointment to reach another final but insisted that the memory of two years ago would not condition what happens at San Siro. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cDestiny is written. I have a lovely memory of the last time and if I had to sign up for something, I\u2019d sign up for that; if I had to produce a film, I would do it the same way. But I am approaching this as if it didn\u2019t happen. We\u2019ve moved onto a new page. \u201cThey must have a bad taste from last time but you can\u2019t lie there on the floor in pain, you have to rise up again and that\u2019s what they did \u2013 that\u2019s why they are here. The pressure exists when you play for a final and you have to know how to manage that. I don\u2019t know if they are under pressure. I do know that I don\u2019t have any less desire for having won it two years ago: we want to keep on winning.\u201d Real\u2019s coach, Zinedine Zidane, said that defeat would not represent a failure for his side. \u201cNo one will take from us what we have done until now,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure would be in the attitude, but if we give everything we have got, if we do the things we have worked on, that\u2019s not a failure. It\u2019s a game of football and you can never tell what will happen. What I can tell you is we are ready, very ready. It\u2019s going to be hard for both teams. It\u2019s 50-50; there is no favourite. \u201cI\u2019m a bit stressed because it\u2019s hot and I have to respond to a lot of people but I\u2019m fine. Tomorrow I will be a bit more tense as always but that\u2019s part of the job of a coach. I like that; I like this pressure. I lived it as a player but it\u2019s totally different as a manager. Carlo [Ancelotti] told me before the final in Lisbon: one day I hope you\u2019ll live this as a head coach. And I always remember him. What we have to do tomorrow is run: run, run and run.\u201d On the fitness of Cristiano Ronaldo, who limped out of training on Tuesday with a thigh injury, Zidane said: \u201cRonaldo is fine ... but even if he wasn\u2019t he\u2019d play; it\u2019s a final.\u201d",
