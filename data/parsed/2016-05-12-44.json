  "body": "Corinne Bailey Rae\u2019s last album, 2010\u2019s The Sea, was a grief-stricken affair that dealt with the death of her first husband. Time has been a healer, and this follow-up documents the storm breaking and light emerging into Bailey Rae\u2019s life and lyrics: \u201cLike seeing the sun again, after years of pouring rain,\u201d she sings on standout track Caramel. Bailey Rae\u2019s adoration of classic soul can be both a blessing and a curse. Do You Ever Think of Me, with its shifting chords and sweet falsetto peaks, treads a little too closely to Curtis Mayfield\u2019s The Makings of You for comfort, and other tracks tend to drift so smoothly they can pass you by. But on Caramel, her soulful vocals are given space to bloom over a billowing pop backdrop. And with the likes of Frank Ocean and Kendrick Lamar reviving jazzy, 70s psych-soul, the laidback approach Bailey Rae takes on tracks such as Been to the Moon sounds perfectly in keeping with the times.
