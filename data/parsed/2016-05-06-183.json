Related: Matthew Bourne takes risk on ballet version of The Red Shoes    This year\u2019s Umbrella bears all the marks of director Emma Gladstone\u2019s jauntily experimental spirit. I\u2019m particularly intrigued by Unknown Pleasures \u2013 a co-commission with CNN Ballet de Lorraine and Sadler\u2019s Wells \u2013 in which the identities of the five choreographers featured in the programme (four women and one man ranging from their 30s to their 70s) will remain anonymous. It\u2019s an idea as political as it is playful \u2013 addressing the roles that reputation, gender, age and pecking order all play in our evaluations of work, whether we\u2019re conscious of them or not. In its selection of named choreographers, Umbrella is pitching a nice balance between the familiar and the new. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel, who does magical things with non-professional performers, presents Gala, a London-specific commission that takes place at three different locations (including the Tanks at Tate Modern) and features a cast of ordinary Londoners, from a divertingly eclectic range of jobs and backgrounds. Aditi Mangaldas, one of India\u2019s new wave of Kathak choreographers, returns to London with her work Inter_rupted, an experimental weave of classical and contemporary dance forms. Dimitris Papaioannou, best known for his work choreographing and directing the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympics, presents the UK premiere of Primal Matter \u2013 a duet between a naked and a clothed performer that explores the history of the body in religion and art.     A scene from The Show Must Go On by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel, who brings new work to locations across London. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    Real life intrudes into dance in Laura Dannequin\u2019s The Secret Slowness of Movement, in which the audience are invited to have an immersive experience with grass (the garden variety); and in Wallflower, a piece by the Manchester-based group Quarantine that explores our collective dance memory through evocations of school discos and wedding dances. I\u2019m looking forward to i ride in colour and soft focus, no longer anywhere, a work by Jamila Johnson-Small \u2013 whose sharp blogs make for one of the most interesting commentaries in the independent dance scene. The Wells, meanwhile, brings out some big hitters, starting with the Alvin Ailey company on the first leg of its UK tour. They have a new director in Robert Battle, and while the repertory retains the stamp of its founder (Ailey\u2019s signature work Revelations is danced, as always, at the end of each of the three programmes) there are some interesting additions from Aszure Barton, Christopher Wheeldon and Battle himself. The company\u2019s dancers are reliably excellent, sleek and expressive, and an incidental pleasure to their UK tour will be their inclusion in the cast of the Royal Ballet\u2019s performances of Wayne McGregor\u2019s Chroma in November, the first time that dancers from the two companies have ever danced together in the same work.     A scene from a 2002 production of Alvin Ailey\u2019s Revelations, which returns along with new work to Sadler\u2019s Wells. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    Another headline of the Wells programme should be Michael Keegan-Dolan\u2019s Swan Lake. Keegan-Dolan has one of the most boggling and fertile dance imaginations on the planet, and in this re-imagining of the ballet classic he filters the story through the myth \u2013 and the modern urban reality \u2013 of his native Ireland, adding a score of Irish and Nordic folk music, played live with fiddle, cello, banjo, whistle, voice and percussion. Also making a raid on ballet tradition is Akram Khan, in his re-imagined Giselle for English National Ballet. Khan\u2019s choreographic imagination is often at its most potent when dealing with spiritual and supernatural themes and he\u2019s a natural fit with the moonlit ghosts of the Romantic classic. Matthew Bourne pits himself against a very different ballet classic with his new production of The Red Shoes. Inspired more by the Powell and Pressburger film than the Hans Christian Andersen tale, it faces up to the magisterial ghosts of Robert Helpmann, Leonid Massine and Moira Shearer. Many Wells regulars are back this season. Rambert celebrates its 90th anniversary and its status as Britain\u2019s oldest dance company, with Mark Baldwin\u2019s massively ambitious setting of Haydn\u2019s Creation, which features 50 dancers and 70 singers and musicians. The company also perform a programme of new works from Alexander Whitley, Malgorzata Dzierzon and Patricia Okenwa. Whitley\u2019s choreography also features in Candoco\u2019s 25th anniversary double bill, alongside an adaptation of the ineffably witty and wonderful Trisha Brown classic, Set and ReSet. Birmingham Royal Ballet give the London premieres of their two Shakespeare 400 commissions, David Bintley\u2019s The Tempest and Jessica Lang\u2019s Wink, while the Jasmin Vardimon Company perform Vardimon\u2019s new family-friendly adaptation of Pinocchio.      Hetain Patel in American Boy \u2013 now becoming American Man. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    It\u2019s a good spread of UK companies, but the Wells is always a reliable conduit for new international dance, and I\u2019m glad of the introduction to Israeli choreographers Sharon Eyal and Gai Behar in their work OCD Love; also to Chinese choreographer Yang Liping who, as part of the theatre\u2019s mini season of Asian work, experiments with a modern adaptation of the classic Chinese tale Farewell My Concubine. What\u2019s also pleasing about this season is the strengthening role of the Lilian Baylis Studio for works that need an intimate space. One of the show\u2019s I\u2019m most looking forward to is American Man, Hetain Patel\u2019s follow up to the gabbily genius solo American Boy, in which he imagines a dystopian world where Barack Obama is the CEO of Apple and Oprah Winfrey is in control of government policy.",
