The government continues to focus on border protection \u2013 even as the bad taste left by the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, lingers \u2013 and today Labor has staked its claim on health. Opposition leader Bill Shorten\u2019s vow to end the Coalition\u2019s six-year freeze on increases to the Medicare rebate is the biggest policy commitment of the campaign so far. And it doesn\u2019t come cheap: $2.4bn over the next four years, and $12.2bn over the decade. But it will help to win Labor the support of Australia\u2019s doctors, who resisted the Turnbull government\u2019s controversial extension of the freeze (introduced by Labor in July 2012) from mid-2018 to mid-2020 in the 2016 budget. Medical groups say that would force GPs to introduce co-payments to cover the ever-growing funding gap, and to pass the costs on to patients. Last week doctors campaigned against the government\u2019s plan with posters warning \u201cThe federal government\u2019s freeze on Medicare rebates will hurt you\u201d in thousands of GP clinics across the country. Labor\u2019s announcement, then, is big \u2013 evidence, Shorten says, that Labor \u201cwill fight with every ounce of our energy to defend and save Medicare\u201d. But he couldn\u2019t guarantee that fees wouldn\u2019t go up when the rebate freeze is lifted, and wasn\u2019t clear how Labor arrived at the finding that patients, if the freeze remained, would be left about $20 out of pocket. (The Coalition has characterised the policy as unfunded spending by a party that struggles with economic forecasting.) Shorten also struggled to keep on message in the face of more questions about his frontbencher David Feeney. The Australian newspaper reported that while in Canberra the MP stays at an apartment owned by his wife through a family trust \u2013 and not specifically listed on his return in the parliamentary register of interests \u2013 as well as claiming a $270-a-night travel allowance. This is just days after Feeney admitted failing to declare a $2.3m negatively geared property in Northcote, Melbourne, with no more robust an explanation than it slipped his mind. Embarrassingly, his tenants have erected a placard for the Greens candidate Alex Bhathal, from whom Feeney is facing stiff competition for his Melbourne seat of Batman. Later Shorten was witness to a head-on car crash at Testers Hollow near Maitland, just as his convoy were pulling up for a press conference. A 21-year-old woman and a 33-year-old woman, who had her two-year-old son in her car, had to be freed by emergency service workers. The younger woman suffered head injuries and was taken to John Hunter hospital, where she was in a stable condition. The other woman and her son were unhurt and invited into Shorten\u2019s car, where he comforted them for about half an hour. He cancelled his campaign events in Maitland but was due to attend an event in Sydney on Thursday night. Dutton digs in over his description of refugees The immigration minister is standing by his description of refugees as illiterate, innumerate, dole-bludging beacons of industry, who spend their unemployment benefits on coopting opportunities that, it was written in the stars, were destined to go towards real Australians. We\u2019re paraphrasing, of course, just as Julie Bishop and Malcolm Turnbull did. Speaking to Ray Hadley on 2GB this morning, Dutton classified objection to his statements as politicking: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can argue against the facts.\u201d (Speaking of, here\u2019s Guardian Australia\u2019s fact check of his statement.) That said, he seemed careful not to repeat Wednesday\u2019s wording. Dutton said Australia\u2019s strong migration program was \u201ca good thing that helps us grow\u201d, and that he was in favour of increasing the annual intake of humanitarian refugees to 50,000 \u2013 adding the usual line about Labor being \u201ctorn apart\u201d on the issue. \u201cBill Shorten has failed the leadership test when it comes to border protection in this country \u2013 as Julia Gillard did, as Kevin Rudd did,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is he going to do to rein these people in?\u201d These people. It seems that Dutton\u2019s statement on Wednesday left a bad taste, with even his colleagues seeking to distance themselves from him with iterations of \u201cWhat I\u2019m sure Peter meant was ... \u201d Turnbull said today that Labor\u2019s criticism amounted to \u201cdemonisation\u201d of the immigration minister, continuing the pair\u2019s good cop-bad cop routine, writes Katharine Murphy. But objection continues to roll on for a second day, and not just on Twitter, although there people are digging up Dutton\u2019s less articulate tweets to highlight his own grasp of the English language.

I'm so ready to do this... #auspol https://t.co/nB1Z63VnrK\u2014 peterdutton (@peterdutton) May 18, 2016    The Today host and noted man of the people, Karl Stefanovic, condemned Dutton\u2019s comments in a Waleed Aly-style piece-to-cam, sharing his and others\u2019 stories of migrant backgrounds and ending with a call for the minister to apologise. \u201cThis country is built on so many pillars including those who come from faraway lands with not much more than hope and a drive for a better life with their family,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have made this a better place. They helped make modern Australia ... \u201cIt\u2019s a cliche but what Peter Dutton said yesterday was un-Australian.\u201d Stefanovic\u2019s sentiments are echoed in the findings of a new survey from Amnesty International that shows Australian people \u2013 if not politicians \u2013 are among the most welcoming of refugees in the world, with seven in 10 saying more should be done to help people fleeing war and persecution. Company tax cuts worth the grief, says PM The keystone of the Turnbull government\u2019s budget \u2013 company tax cuts \u2013 was under scrutiny from more than one angle. The prime minister was asked why it was more compelling for voters than extra spending on health and education, a pointed question in light of Labor\u2019s announcement. Turnbull trotted out the now well-worn figure that every dollar cut in company tax created $4 of value in the economy overall. But John Daley, of the Grattan Institute, wrote in Guardian Australia this morning that these benefits were modelled on a 2015 treasury research paper and overstated: \u201cCorporate tax cuts may be worth doing, but the outcome is unlikely to set pulses racing.\u201d Turnbull \u2013 back on the \u201cjobs and growth [feat. turning back boats]\u201d beat, matching Labor\u2019s commitment to fund the Appin Road in western Sydney \u2013 simply said Daley was wrong. But political and bureaucratic luminaries voiced further criticism of the budget at a forum organised by the Australian National University in Canberra. The former deputy secretary to the treasury, Jan Harris, said the response was reminiscent of reaction to the 2010 budget, when the government delivered the biggest deficit in Australia\u2019s history. Once again, the forecasted return to surplus has been pushed back into the future. Remember Dr Karl Kruszelnicki\u2019s ill-fated promotion of the intergenerational report when he warned about the gap between the government\u2019s tax receipts and its spending commitments? \u201cWell, not much has changed in the 2016-17 budget,\u201d Harris said.
