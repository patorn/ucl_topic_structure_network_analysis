To deal with it, he started yelling at whoever was in front of him at the time, as though he\u2019d meant to honk at them. Like: \u201cHey you old lady! What the hell are you doing crossing the street, at a crosswalk!\u201d I pissed; I just had never seen anyone think like that. The funniest sketch I\u2019ve ever seen   I\u2019d have said some chestnut from Monty Python or SNL but Key & Peele have wiped all that out of my memory. Probably their insult comic sketch where a horribly burned guy badgers a comedian to make fun of him and the comedian doesn\u2019t want to. Utter genius. The funniest meal I\u2019ve ever eaten   Some Andouille sausage in Paris that smelled like human shit. I still had a few big bites, though. The funniest person I know   My wife has made me lose my mind screaming laughing the most. The hardest I\u2019ve ever laughed was one time when we were crossing a street and she decided to pretend she was, like, four inches tall and had difficulty climbing the kerb and I am laughing now thinking about it. Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd would\u2019ve tried to license the move from her. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had   The swollen pageboy microphone head I had in high school as I tried to grow my hair long. The funniest book I\u2019ve ever read   The Thought Gang by Tibor Fischer. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing at that. Main character surveys himself and sees a patch of dark on his trousers \u201cthat could only be slothful urine\u201d. So good. The funniest dream I\u2019ve ever had   The ones where I discover I can fellate myself and I do it in the middle of a Sainsbury\u2019s and people throw lettuce at me. The funniest joke I\u2019ve ever heard   Some old, scumbag roast comic who said his wife couldn\u2019t be at an event because she was staying at Tempura House, a shelter for lightly battered women. That\u2019s a country mile beyond the pale but I\u2019ve never seen anyone, women included, not involuntarily laugh very loudly about that fantastic hateful joke.
