  "body": "Frankie Dettori summed up the news from a busy morning here in a sentence. \u201cWith this one I\u2019m just hoping for the best,\u201d he said after exercising Wings Of Desire, the joint-favourite for the Derby, around Tattenham Corner on Tuesday, \u201cbecause there are possibly 10 horses which could be as good as mine.\u201d   Related: Midterm fifth as Frankie Dettori wins Dante Stakes on Wings Of Desire    The runners and riders for this year\u2019s Investec Derby will not be finalised until Thursday week but already it seems certain that the field for this year\u2019s Classic will be one of the most competitive for many years. No Derby favourite this century has started at a bigger price than 7-2 but Wings Of Desire and Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s US Army Ranger currently head the ante-post betting on 4-1. Cloth Of Stars, who also had a mock exam around Tattenham Corner on Tuesday morning, is an 8-1 chance while the latest springer in the market is Ulysses, a maiden winner at Newbury earlier this month, who is now top-priced at 9-1. Both Dettori and Micka\u00ebl Barzalona, who rode Cloth Of Stars, were suitably content afterwards that their horses will act on the track on Saturday week. Like so many other contenders, however, all they have proved to date is that they deserve to be in the field along with at least a dozen other colts with broadly similar claims. As Dettori himself reported, there are \u201cgood vibes in Newmarket\u201d about Ulysses while Wings Of Desire\u2019s success in the Dante Stakes was far less comprehensive than his win in the same race aboard Golden Horn, the subsequent Derby winner, last season. \u201cI think it was a good performance in the Dante,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cHe had to overcome a lot of trouble and to me he was the best horse in the race. We know the horse is still a baby and still learning, so today we took him here to get a feel of the bend and the downhill and just get him a feel of the surroundings. \u201cHe\u2019s achieved a lot in a short space of time. He won the Dante by a neck, so it\u2019s a bit unfair to compare him to Golden Horn. It\u2019s a different kind of pressure but I\u2019m looking forward to the challenge.\u201d Barzalona, who has a 100% record in the Derby having won on his only previous start aboard Pour Moi five years ago, will be hoping to give Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Godolphin operation its first winner of the Classic in their famous blue colours. \u201cWe did very easy work and I was very pleased with the work,\u201d Barzalona said. \u201cIn France most of the tracks are really flat, so the corner and the undulations make a big difference. When we get positions, we don\u2019t change or fight, so that\u2019s not going to be the same and I think it\u2019s important to come over and get a look. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to compare him [with Pour Moi]. Pour Moi had really strong acceleration, Cloth Of Stars is more of a worker. [But] he has proved he is the best three-year-old in France over a mile-and-a-quarter and we are really sure that he is going to stay.\u201d Godolphin\u2019s colours will also be carried in the Derby by Moonlight Magic, the winner of the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown, who is trained by Jim Bolger. \u201cI rate him as a good Derby prospect and I wouldn\u2019t swap him for anything else in the race,\u201d Bolger said on Tuesday morning. \u201cHe has the looks, demeanour, balance and temperament to go with his pedigree [Cape Cross half-brother to Masterstroke and Hidden Gold]. There are no holes in this fella and he\u2019s beautifully balanced, so hopefully he will handle Epsom well. \u201cOn the day he won the Derrinstown I thought he was as good a winner as St Jovite [Bolger\u2019s 1992 Derby runner-up and subsequent Irish Derby winner] had been. We\u2019ll have to wait and see whether he gets up to that level or not but I couldn\u2019t have been happier with him than I am.\u201d Sir Michael Stoute, trainer of Ulysses, said that, despite his colt\u2019s relative inexperience \u2013 his three runs to date have all been in maiden events \u2013 he is confident that Epsom will not catch him out. \u201cHe\u2019s really well-balanced and he has an Epsom pedigree [by the Derby winner Galileo out of the Oaks winner Light Shift] and we\u2019ve always loved him,\u201d Stoute said. \u201cHe had a hiccup in January, so we didn\u2019t have him fully fit at Leicester [last time] but he couldn\u2019t have done it better than he did and he\u2019s really been improving since.\u201d Stoute will also be reunited with his former stable jockey Kieren Fallon at Epsom on Saturday week after the jockey, who rode both Kris Kin and North Light to victory for the trainer, was booked to ride the outsider Across The Stars. \u201cWe\u2019ll hope for the best,\u201d Stoute said. \u201cThe owner [Saeed Suhail, who also owned Kris Kin] was keen to run.\u201d Aidan O\u2019Brien still has eight entries in the Derby, with Monday\u2019s supplementary stage still to come, but it now seems unlikely that The Gurkha, easy winner of the Poule d\u2019Essai des Poulains [French 2,000 Guineas] this month, will line up at Epsom. The final team from Ballydoyle could consist of four runners, headed by US Army Ranger, who edged out his stablemate Port Douglas in the Chester Vase when receiving 5lb from the runner-up. Port Douglas is also likely to make the trip to the Downs, along with Deauville, the runner-up behind Wings Of Desire in the Dante, and Idaho, third home behind Moonlight Magic in the Derrinstown. Which of them will be the mount of Ryan Moore, however, will not become clear for some days yet. \u201cRyan thinks a lot about everything and he doesn\u2019t say a lot until he has to say it,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019ll leave it as late as he wants, we\u2019ll tell him what we think and then he\u2019ll make a decision. \u201cWe were very happy with US Army Ranger at Chester. We knew it was always a danger that he\u2019d find Chester very strange and in ideal world we would have preferred a faster pace early, but Port Douglas didn\u2019t go very fast in the first half and they only started to race when US Army Ranger joined him. \u201cPort Douglas was leaning on him, he had the crowd on his left and Port Douglas on his right, and he went up the straight in cruise control rather than getting down to really gallop. We hope that it was greenness and he should have come on and learned a lot from it.\u201d O\u2019Brien also reported that Minding, the favourite for the Oaks on 3 June, had no blood in her sinuses on Tuesday morning following an injury sustained in the stalls before the Irish 1,000 Guineas on Sunday, in which she finished a close second behind Jet Setting. \u201cShe cantered this morning,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cShe would do very little for the next 10 days and, all being well, it would be the Oaks, I\u2019d imagine.\u201d The opposition to Minding could well increase at the supplementary stage after a change of heart by Godolphin, as Skiffle, winner of the Height of Fashion Stakes at Goodwood last week, is now a possible runner at Epsom having previously seemed likely to wait for the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot. \u201cWe\u2019ll decide over the weekend,\u201d John Ferguson, Godolphin\u2019s chief executive, said on Tuesday. \u201cShe won really well at Goodwood. The immediate reaction was that we would wait for the Ribblesdale but things look a little more open [following Minding\u2019s defeat at the weekend] so the option of supplementing her is a definite possibility.\u201d",
