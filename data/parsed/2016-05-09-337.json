  "body": "If you thought there was nothing left to say about the lame duck white paper [pdf], spare a thought for the school admissions system. Admissions in England are a mess. There are too many schools with the power to decide which pupils they admit, too many socially selective admissions criteria permissible under the code of practice, and the system of \u201cpolicing\u201d admissions is too weak. The plans to coerce thousands of schools to become academies may have been jettisoned but the government isn\u2019t giving up altogether in its goal of full academisation by 2022, which means the problem with admissions can only get worse. More academies means more schools with \u201cfreedom\u201d in this area. It also means an even weaker role for local authorities, which are meant to oversee local arrangements and (wishful thinking) to take a progressive view of how school places might be allocated fairly in their patch. The white paper is also a missed opportunity. Before it was published there were hints that councils would go back to managing admissions for all schools. In fact, the proposals are a damp squib. Requiring councils to coordinate in-year admissions (for pupils outside the usual admissions time) simply takes us back to where we were three years ago, before the coalition returned these powers to schools.   Related: The teacher standing as mayor to fight for fairer school admissions    Lifting the requirement for sixth forms to comply with the code will make the mix of covert and overt selection post-16 even worse. And the pledge to ensure parents can \u201ceasily understand how to get a place at their local school\u201d betrays a thorough misunderstanding of how complex this process is, how cleverly it can be manipulated, and how much worse it will be in a fully academised system. Don\u2019t take my word for that. Read the respected head of Passmores academy in Essex, Vic Goddard, writing in Education Guardian earlier this year about the gaming that already exists. \u201cIf someone is not given the job of overseeing academy admissions,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthen we will not all be in this together. The young people who don\u2019t help an academy with its league table position will be made to feel like second-class citizens.\u201d Or look at the recent report from the Centre for High Performance (CHP) [pdf], in which researchers from Kingston and Oxford Universities studied the methods used by 160 academies to improve their performance. Among the \u201clearning\u201d points in their conclusion was the revelation that schools could \u201cchange the type of pupils\u201d they admit. So great was the uproar about this unexpected honesty that the paper was removed from the CHP website. This is regrettable. The researchers have nothing to be ashamed about as they were revealing only what many people know. Given the situation we are in, this evidence should be disseminated widely. At the end of last week the London School of Economics also produced a report, looking at admissions in London over the past 15 years. Unsurprisingly it discovered that more schools than ever in the capital are responsible for their own admissions, up from 40% in 2001 to nearly 80% in 2015. This is, of course, owing to the rise of academies. Case studies included councils in which every secondary school manages its own admissions and where some non-denominational schools admit pupils in up to nine \u201cbands\u201d of ability \u2013 ostensibly to achieve a balanced intake \u2013 and also by aptitude, catchment area, feeder school and distance. And those are schools without any faith criteria. Some schools that use banding run their own tests at odd times, which means children sitting a plethora of different assessments in a way that might disadvantage certain types of family. Others arrange their bands to reflect the national spread of ability, or the ability range of the applicants, rather than the local context. If either of the former is above the local range of ability, the school magically guarantees itself an intake skewed towards the most able.   Related: Academies guilty of the most blatant gaming of all: a school place only for the brightest    London has always been a highly charged quasi-market, but inevitably academisation is carrying these practices around the country, as the combination of parental choice, league table pressure and the sheer power to manipulate becomes more commonplace. It is blindingly obvious which children will lose out, which is why radical action is needed now. The LSE researchers make sound suggestions, which the DfE should heed if we really are to have thousands more individual admissions authorities in England. Each school\u2019s admissions criteria should, by law, be simple and easy to understand. The local authority should be empowered to work with schools to maximise fair access. No school should manage its own admissions: this should be in the hands of an independent body, and banding assessments should be carried out in school time, preferably with one test used by all schools in an area-wide scheme. We are still in the twilight zone between the publication of the white paper, the Queen\u2019s speech and new legislation or regulation. Whatever further climbdowns, tweaks or amendments the government is considering, a tougher stand on admissions should be a priority.",
