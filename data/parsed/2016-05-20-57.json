  "body": "I\u2019m rapidly approaching 63 years of age. I grew up in a Daily Mirror-reading family on a council estate in Harwich. I left school at 16, got a job as a trainee accountant and two years later somehow ended up at drama school. Until I was 33 I worked as a fairly unsuccessful actor. I started reading the Guardian at drama school, mainly for the theatre reviews, and by the mid-70s it had become my newspaper of choice. I even appeared in an article, \u201cCamp Theatre\u201d, about theatre at Butlin\u2019s in August 1975. In 1983 I met Maria, my wife of over 30 years, at the English Theatre in Frankfurt and moved to Germany permanently in 1986 to work as an English teacher. We have two sons aged 30 and 16 (number two was a bit of a shock), and live in a beautiful 17th-century half-timbered house. I still work for the same company, Target Training, as a part-time bookkeeper. The rest of the time I work as a voice-over artist whenever an English voice is required, and still do the odd bit of theatre. When I first came to Germany I read the Guardian Weekly, but now during the week I read the Guardian online, and every Saturday buy the paper. I start with the sport, family, travel and then move on to the news section. I always save the review section for Sunday morning with a cup of tea in bed, while Maria does the puzzles. The Guardian is the closest newspaper to me politically and tends to be grown up, except for some of the readers\u2019 comments. Friends here sometimes claim it\u2019s too PC, but maybe so am I. I used to love reading Frank Keating, and now enjoy Lucy Mangan, Ian Jack, Gary Younge and the letters. To be honest I love it all. Except for all the ads in the Saturday edition. 90% of them are aimed solely at British consumers. Can it be that difficult to edit them out of the European edition? I can\u2019t imagine ever not reading the Guardian, even if you bring in a paywall. \u2022 If you would like to be interviewed in this space, send a brief note to good.to.meet.you@theguardian.com",
