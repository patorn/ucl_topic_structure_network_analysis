  "body": "There is no such thing as a \u201ctypical\u201d day, even when I\u2019m busy on a book. Some days\u00a0the words flow, others feel like wading through suet. The phone rings, the doorbell sounds, there\u2019s shopping to be\u00a0done or\u00a0an urgent email demanding a reply. That\u2019s why I\u00a0try to get away. I\u2019ve got a\u00a0house on the north-east coast\u00a0of Scotland, three and a half hours by\u00a0car\u00a0from Edinburgh. Very limited mobile phone signal and no TV. There\u2019s a landline but I haven\u2019t given the number to my agent, publisher or any journalist. Perfect. I\u2019m in the middle of\u00a0a new book right now. It\u2019s going pretty well. The first draft took me 27\u00a0writing days. It\u2019s rough \u2013 really just\u00a0me checking the plot works. The\u00a0second draft sees me polish the prose, fix faults in chronology and geography, and add meat to the bones of my characters. So while my first drafts are usually done at a gallop \u2013 if\u00a0I\u2019m writing quickly, then the story will also have pace \u2013 I take things more slowly in the second and third drafts. The third draft is normally what my publisher and agent get to see.    I never have a clearly defined plan. The story has a sense of where it wants to go, and I just follow it    A good writing day would comprise maybe 10 pages, which is around 3,000 words. I don\u2019t do a word count. The story is as long as it needs to be, and better to pen 1,500 great words than 5,000 ordinary ones. The day might start at 11am, or 2 in the afternoon, or 7\u00a0in the evening. Two things always take precedence: newspaper and crossword. Oh, and strong coffee. I don\u2019t smoke and used to be a demon for pause-filler chocolate bars, but I am kicking that habit. I\u00a0break now for tea (or more coffee) and stare at the kettle as I ponder the next few lines of the book. When I\u00a0go up north, I write in a\u00a0room at the top of the house. If it\u2019s cold, I\u2019ll light the wood-burner. When the sun\u2019s out, I\u00a0often go for a walk and do my writing in\u00a0the late afternoon or evening. When I hit a wall or a problem, a walk often brings sudden illumination. Or else I\u00a0phone my wife and talk\u00a0it through with her \u2013 she reads a lot\u00a0of fiction and\u00a0has helped me on many occasions. During the first draft I don\u2019t pause to\u00a0read what I\u2019ve written, except maybe after the first 100 or so pages. I do that over a few days, making notes about where the book could go next. I never have a clearly defined plan \u2013 I almost never know the ending before I\u2019m well into the book. The story has a sense of where it wants to go, and I just follow it. A character in my first draft may change their name, because I\u2019ve forgotten what I called them originally \u2013 that\u2019s fine; it can all be fixed later. I also don\u2019t pause if I get stuck on a\u00a0word or a description \u2013 I will fix that\u00a0in a future draft. I do make notes as\u00a0I\u00a0go\u00a0\u2013 what might happen; how characters or incidents may connect \u2013 but\u00a0even this isn\u2019t fixed and I may find a\u00a0better idea later. So I\u2019ve got all these Post-it notes stuck around the desk, plus scrawled reminders on sheets of\u00a0paper and scribbles in the margins of\u00a0the manuscript. I work on a very old laptop \u2013 when the screen died, I\u00a0had it replaced rather than buy a new machine. Every day or two I\u00a0print out what I\u2019ve written, just so\u00a0I\u00a0have it. I\u00a0also save each day\u2019s work to\u00a0a memory stick that goes everywhere with me. Safety first. Oh, did I mention music? There\u2019s usually some playing while I work. I\u00a0have a few totemic CDs I use while writing: Brian Eno, Tangerine Dream, Boards of Canada, Mogwai, Aphex Twin, Coleman Hawkins. Nothing with lyrics; I can\u2019t work if someone else\u2019s words are swirling around me. So: a certain solitude; tea or coffee; music; and the inside of my head. Twenty-seven days later, I have the first draft of a novel that will be published towards the end of 2016. It\u2019s going to be called Rather Be the Devil \u2013 I\u00a0can\u2019t do anything until I have a title I\u2019m\u00a0happy with. Usually it reflects the theme I\u00a0have in mind for the book. Having finished the second draft, I break off to do the research, because by then I know what I need to\u00a0know rather than what I might need\u00a0to know. Again, this speeds things\u00a0up wonderfully.",
