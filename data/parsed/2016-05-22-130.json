  "body": "Born in Wales in 1966, Sarah Waters studied English at the University of Kent, followed by Lancaster University and Queen Mary\u2019s, where her PhD thesis focused on lesbian and gay historical fiction. Immediately afterwards she started working on her first novel, Tipping the Velvet (a title taken from 19th-century pornography), which was published in 1998. Waters has won a number of awards: in 2003 alone, she was named one of Granta\u2019s 20 best young British writers, received the South Bank award for literature, and was named author of the year at the British Book Awards. The stage adaptation of her 2006 novel The Night Watch is on at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange until 18 June. 1 | Cinema Blind Cinema     Blind Cinema: \u2018intimate and inventive.\u2019 Photograph: Britt Hatzius    I liked the sound of this Britt Hatzius project so much that I gave myself the day off work and made a special trip to Bristol for it, where it\u2019s been playing as part of the excellent Mayfest. The concept is brilliantly strange and simple: you sit in a cinema with a blindfold on, while a 10-year-old child sitting just behind you watches a specially made film and whispers a description of the action into your ear. The resulting narration (\u201cThere are murderers in the jungle. They have red eyes. Or they might be wearing red contact lenses\u201d) is intimate, fumbling, inventive, unique. 2 | Website Pride of Place It\u2019s great to see a mainstream institution like Historic England recognising the importance of queer history, and this website \u2013 a collaboration with Leeds Beckett University and community groups across the country \u2013 is a treat. Among other features, its interactive map of England allows users to identify sites of LGBTQ significance, with inspiring and wonderfully diverse results. Locations include the spot in Haymarket, London, where, in 1822, the Bishop of Clogher was caught in a compromising position with a Grenadier Guardsman; Woking Golf Club, where lesbian composer Dame Ethel Smyth apparently liked to trespass in the men\u2019s section of the clubhouse; and the Lancaster branch of British Home Stores, scene of a 1976 picket against the sacking of a gay employee. 3 | Museum The Cinema Museum, London     The Cinema Museum: \u2018wonderfully eccentric.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    I did a \u201cDesert Island Movies\u201d evening at the Cinema Museum a few months ago, and it was one of the most enjoyable events I\u2019ve ever done \u2013 largely because of the wonderfully eccentric nature of the museum itself, which is housed in a huge old building left over from the Lambeth workhouse. Run by passionate volunteers, it has a unique collection of cinema memorabilia, and offers a crowded programme of events including screenings, talks and interviews. You can settle down for the evening in a broken cinema seat or a sagging sofa, and get a cup of tea and a flapjack at half time \u2013 perfect. 4 | Theatre The Flick, Annie Baker     Jaygann Ayeh and Louisa Krause in The Flick at the National: \u2018a weirdly powerful moment.\u2019 Photograph: Mark Douet    Made up of bits of conversation between three unhappy staff members in a rundown American movie theatre, Baker\u2019s play is a tender, funny study of disappointments and failed connections. Though I wasn\u2019t entirely convinced by every one of the (many) silences in the production I saw at the National Theatre last week, I loved the bravery of them. And I adored the minutes-long sequence in which the actors left the stage and reappeared in the projectionist\u2019s booth, and we had to watch the ensuing soundless action through the two small square apertures at the back of the set \u2013 a weirdly powerful moment, like nothing I\u2019d ever seen in the theatre before. 5 | Book Living on Paper: Letters from Iris Murdoch 1934-1995     Iris Murdoch: \u2018bold and passionate.\u2019 Photograph: Jane Bown    I\u2019ve always been a big Iris Murdoch fan, so I was delighted to receive a copy of this book as a present from my parents-in-law last Christmas. It\u2019s a lovely read, revealing Murdoch to have been warm, bold, passionate and loyal \u2013 to have lived her life with an incredibly open heart. And, crucially, it\u2019s made me return to her novels and remember how bloody good they are \u2013 how intelligent, how lucent, how divinely crazy. They\u2019re fun \u2013 I\u2019d forgotten that. I can feel Murdoch\u2019s work slipping out of literary fashion, and I think it\u2019s a huge shame. 6 | TV Happy Valley     Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley: \u2018a light-touch exploration of the gendered nature of crime.\u2019 Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC/Red Productions    Yes, everyone already knows how brilliant this is, but I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that I\u2019ve only just watched it. The first series in particular just blew me away. Sarah Lancashire is amazing, Siobhan Finneran is fabulous (I always had a perverse crush on her when she was mean Miss O\u2019Brien in Downton), and the naturalism of the dialogue makes you realise how stilted and silly much TV dialogue is. But what I love most about the show is the genius, light-touch way in which Sally Wainwright explores the gendered nature of crime \u2013 focusing not just on the male perpetrators of violence but on the women who have relationships with them as victims, law-enforcers, wives and mothers. 7 | Fair Bloomsbury Ephemera Fair     Bloomsbury ephemera fair: \u2018my nerd heaven.\u2019 Photograph: bloomsburyephemerafair.com    It\u2019s hard to admit to being a collector \u2013 it makes you sound like such a nerd. But I\u2019ve been collecting Victorian and Edwardian postcards for about 25 years, and though there are lots of opportunities now to buy postcards online, nothing beats the thrill of the chase: my particular nerd heaven is this monthly London collectors\u2019 fair, where I can patiently work my way through several hundred postcards in a single Sunday afternoon. The fair has stalls selling antique books and ephemera and they are always worth a look too, but it\u2019s the postcards that get me. With their curious images on one side and their suggestive handwritten messages on the other they\u2019re such glorious, poignant scraps of social\u00a0history.",
