  "body": "\u201cIt is far safer to be feared than loved,\u201d wrote Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli in The Prince, the founding text of the philosophy of realpolitik. These days, anyone wishing to establish their credentials as a hard-headed commentator on global affairs need only echo that bleak assessment: sure, it\u2019s all very well for do-gooders to preach love and charity \u2013 but force, or the threat of it, is the only language everyone always understands. The American psychologist Dacher Keltner begs to differ. When you closely observe chimpanzees \u2013 or other primates, such as kindergartners or university students \u2013 you\u2019ll find it is not the bullies and manipulators who gain power, he writes. Rather, it is those who demonstrate empathy and enthusiasm, solve others\u2019 problems and otherwise further the greater good. Were that the end of the story, the world would be ruled exclusively by kindly philanthropists. Readers may have noticed that this is not the case. This is the \u201cparadox\u201d of Keltner\u2019s title: it is true that being nice is the best path to power, but achieving power reliably turns people nasty. \u201cThe seductions of power,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cinduce us to lose the very skills that enabled us to gain power in the first place.\u201d Research demonstrates that people who feel powerful are more likely to act impulsively: to have affairs; to drive inconsiderately; to lie; to argue that it is justifiable for them to break rules others should follow; and, in one entertaining study by Keltner and his colleagues, to steal sweets from children. Rich people even shoplift more than the poor. All in all, accumulating power seems to trigger a tendency to self-absorption: in experiments, when people are asked to draw the letter E on their own foreheads so that others can read it, powerful people are more likely to draw it the right way round to themselves, and backwards to onlookers. In a literal sense, they no longer see the world from other people\u2019s perspective. Keltner, whose earlier work on emotions informed the Pixar movie Inside Out, marshals copper-bottomed evidence for his argument. Unfortunately, he also suffers from a severe case of counterintuitivitis, insisting that his findings show our existing ideas of power to be utterly wrongheaded. But they don\u2019t. The name of Machiavelli is deployed throughout the book to represent the old-school view, but in fact his ruthlessness shocked his Renaissance contemporaries, who fancied themselves more sophisticated. In modern times, \u201csoft power\u201d as a technique of diplomacy is decades old. As for the notion that power contains the seeds of its own destruction, it is hard to imagine that Sophocles or Shakespeare would disagree. But if the power paradox isn\u2019t all that surprising, it is true that we fail to take full account of its implications. If we did, we would reach some alarming insights, especially about politics and organisational life. We hope to bring change by electing or appointing new and different leaders \u2013 yet the power paradox suggests it is precisely through becoming leaders that they lose the qualities we saw in them. Those at the top of the tree \u201cmay be the very people most blind to the problems of powerlessness, poverty, and inequality\u201d \u2013 even if they started out well meaning. Representative democracy, on this account, seems pretty much doomed to fail. It is only a partial compensation to realise that the paradox also implies that political hopefuls such as Donald Trump \u2013 angry, manipulative bullies \u2013 are less likely to acquire power to begin with.   Related: How modern power works: less Game of Thrones, more Black Lives Matter    The sole basis for optimism is Keltner\u2019s conclusion that serving the common good is, ultimately, in the self-interest of the powerful, if they can only resist the temptation to turn into jerks instead. \u201cStay focused on other people \u2026 Bring the good in others to completion \u2026 Take delight in the delights of others, as they make a difference in the world,\u201d he advises. However, his and other researchers\u2019 findings suggest that it is the powerless, not the powerful, who will be most receptive to that message (people low in power report feeling compassion for others far more frequently). One can only hope that a new generation of psychologically informed advisers will take our leaders aside and murmur in their ears the message that, in the long run, compassionate policies are the best way to consolidate their own dominance. Even if you are not a kind person deep down, in other words, it pays to do kind things. This is surely right. Although put like that, doesn\u2019t it start to sound a little duplicitous? Perhaps Machiavelli would have approved. \u2022 Oliver Burkeman\u2019s The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Don\u2019t Like Positive Thinking is published by Canongate.
