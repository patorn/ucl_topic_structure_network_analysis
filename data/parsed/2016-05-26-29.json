  "body": "With such Imax credits as writer of Mission to Mir and director of Hubble 3D to her name, Toni Myers is doing as much as any film-maker to map the galaxy\u2019s outer reaches. Her latest large-format eye-opener achieves a breathtaking new perspective on Earthly life by floating cameras among astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Tim Peake\u2019s Twitter feed: mere dilettantism in comparison.\u00a0            What\u2019s beamed back combines a snapshot of ISS routine \u2013 zero-gravity haircare; terrifying external repairs \u2013 with an overview of landmasses subject to vivid natural and man-made phenomena: thunderstorms exploding under cloud cover; pollution clogged, veiny rivers; and a telling darkness north of the 38th parallel. Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s narration gets so earnest you might wish she\u2019d sunk at least one rum-and-coke beforehand, but elsewhere dry, rational science is mixed with piquant detail and playful soundtrack choices. The result is the best kind of spectacle: that which encourages us to look up and beyond ourselves \u2013 and does so using only organic special effects.",
