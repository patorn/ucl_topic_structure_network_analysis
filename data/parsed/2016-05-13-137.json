  "body": "STUNG AGAIN The Fiver can\u2019t help but think that if we\u2019d offered Watford fans the prospect of a respectable 13th place in the Premier League with an FA Cup semi-final appearance thrown in for their newly promoted side last August, we would currently be typing this edition of the world\u2019s most tea-timely email (other time zones are available) with one hand, pausing occasionally to gaze ruefully down at the cauterised stump of what\u2019s left of the other one while cursing our pre-season generosity. But then, it seems The Fiver\u2019s simple folk who isn\u2019t as tuned in as it used to be when it comes to the ways of the modern football world. It is a world where nothing is ever good enough, hitting targets isn\u2019t so important as exceeding them and results are everything \u2026 so long as they are good ones that were achieved recently enough to remain in the short-term memory of assorted entitled ingrates who it seems can always find something to complain about no matter how far above its weight their team seems to be punching. It is true, of course, that the owners of Watford are entitled to appoint whoever they like to manage their club. And it is equally true that certain sections of the club\u2019s support have every right to expect a manager tasked with integrating 18 new players into his squad to come up with a system successful enough to bag a domestic treble while remaining at all times pleasing on the eye, but there remains something sad about the monotonous predictability of the announcement that emerged from Vicarage Road on Friday morning, in which the club admitted that despite doing everything and more that was asked of him upon his appointment, they would not be renewing the contract of Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, a be-stubbled Spaniard so brooding, smouldering and handsome that he makes his compatriot Antonio Banderas look like the love-child of Iain Dowie and Ivan Campo.   Related: Watford to part company with manager Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores at end of season    \u201cI had a meeting with the club to make a resum\u00e9 of the season and after that I confirmed that the club and me don\u2019t have the same point of view about the season,\u201d said Flores to a visibly swooning Sky Sports News reporter earlier. \u201cSo we don\u2019t have the necessary conditions to activate the clause to renew the contract \u2013 my contract finishes at the end of June \u2013 and then I will leave. I had an amazing behaviour with the fans, I love these fans. I felt completely happy in this year, I enjoyed the experience, it was an amazing journey, so a lot of good memories of this season.\u201d While some Watford supporters on Internet Outrage Generator (admittedly not the most accurate gauge of opinion, but the only one we have at the moment) attempted to justify Watford\u2019s decision to let Flores go by waffling on about their team\u2019s poor recent record, unattractive style of play and non-qualification for Big Cup, West Ham manager Slaven Bilic was quick out of the blocks to slam the decision not to renew Flores\u2019s contract as \u201csick\u201d. But the ice-cool soon-to-be-ex-Watford boss doesn\u2019t need The Fiver to fight his battles \u2013 he\u2019ll soon walk into another job, possibly as the cranky doctor in a major US medical drama, or as the piano-playing sidekick to Stephen Fry. Meanwhile, those Watford fans who were so eager to see the back of him will wait on tenterhooks to find who will succeed him, so they can start grumbling about long-ball tactics, poor results in games that haven\u2019t been played yet and lack of activity in the summer transfer market. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe give our skin\u201d \u2013 Club Deportivo Palencia\u2019s slogan for their preposterous new kit.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cI think you are being really unfair calling the \u2018Appy \u2018Ammers Taxpayers FC (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs) since they actually saved the place from being bulldozed by Spurs or becoming a giant snooker hall owned by that other bloke. A much better moniker would be West HMRC United and then Gollivan could be resident in, say, Bermuda or the BVI to save us having to see their interviews every few days as the time difference would mean we are all tucked up in bed\u201d \u2013 Peter Allen. \u201cCan I request that, in light of Taxpayers FC\u2019s fortuitous rent agreement, that all future reports on players\u2019 salaries be reported as a percentage of that rent? For example, if Player X earns \u00a345,000 a week, it would be written as \u2018Player X will be payed one week\u2019s Taxpayers FC rent\u2019. This will help supporters of less fortuitous clubs maintain a rational grasp of financial matters\u201d \u2013 Phil Withall. \u201cFair cop to the Guardian Ad Sales team \u2013 persuading British Airways to graphically portray Plain Old John Terry\u2019s second finest (to me anyway) Big Cup moment at the same time as the Rumour Mill team lead with news of his impending stay at Chelsea. He really is a popular fellow again\u201d \u2013 Alex Jordan. \u201cI was kind of surprised to see yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs refer to Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 as a Borussia Dortmund player. Given your penchant for club nicknames, maybe I suggest that he\u2019s now a Future Bayern Munich player?\u201d \u2013 Matt Derby.     Obvs. Photograph: Alex Jordan    \u201cSo the Norwich board plan to learn from the mistakes of this season (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs)? Please forgive my scepticism but 28 goals in 2013-14 was the major reason why we were relegated two years ago. Fast forward and top scorer Dieumerci Mbokani scored just seven out of the measly total of 39 in 37 games. A sieve-like defence does not help; but if you can\u2019t bang them in the other end you have no hope. In the unlikely event that we bounce straight back, a striker who actually scores goals has to be the top priority and not another Ricky van Wolfswinkel\u201d \u2013 David Patterson. \u201cRe: Brighton\u2019s ground and station. Can I suggest that Tony Crawford (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) heads to D1cks bar and has a pint of Harveys, rather than either trying to cram on to Falmer Station (the one for the Amex), or dreaming of a wholemeal falafel as he is wandering back through the wilds of Moulescoomb?\u201d \u2013 Ian Crossan. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

BITS AND BOBS POJT is mulling over Chelsea\u2019s offer of a one-year contract extension on reduced terms. \u201cTwenty, 21 years at the club is huge,\u201d parped Guus Hiddink. \u201cThat\u2019s why they become legends. You must cherish those legends for the future as well.\u201d     A banner, presumably from a Chelsea fan, or opposition forward lines, or those in the media looking forward to off-field discord at Stamford Bridge. Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Getty Images    You\u2019d be disappointed if humility\u2019s Zlatan Ibrahimovic had signed off from PSG in any other way. \u201cMy last game tomorrow at Parc des Princes,\u201d he trumpeted. \u201cI came like a king, left like a legend.\u201d Real Madrid have decided to activate their buy-back option on Juve\u2019s \u00c1lvaro Morata but will then sell him on to the highest bidder for around \u00a340m. Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea are all excited, but then so are PSG, where he\u2019ll probably go. Everton want Ronald Koeman to succeed Bobby M and hope to lure Southampton\u2019s coach with the promise of a bumper transfer budget. He\u2019s playing hard to get, mind. \u201cEverybody knows I have one year more contract,\u201d tootled the Dutchman. \u201cAnd we will sit together and we will analyse this season and we will talk about the future \u2013 and that\u2019s what the news is.\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger insists he hasn\u2019t been offered a new deal by Arsenal. \u201cThat\u2019s completely wrong and I don\u2019t know where this information comes from,\u201d he trilled. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely false. I would like the press to check the information before they give it out because they could have checked with the club or with myself and we\u2019d both have denied it.\u201d Portsmouth 2-2 Plymouth was a lively old League Two play-off first leg. \u201cIt had everything you want from a football game,\u201d hollered Pompey boss Paul Cook, who was sent to the stands along with Argyle coach Paul Wotton for an early dust-up, while the visitors\u2019 Jamille Matt \u2013 who scored two, including an overhead kick \u2013 escaped a red card after grazing his head on Michael Doyle\u2019s. \u201cWe feel we should have got decisions we never got but there you go, we are used to that at home.\u201d Danny Ings could be fit earlier than anticipated for Liverpool\u2019s game with West Brom on Sunday. Levski Sofia\u2019s head coach Stoycho Stoev has stepped down from his post, the club\u2019s 18th coaching change in seven years. And Turkey\u2019s S\u00fcper Lig is undergoing a revamp in a bid to end ongoing shambles. \u201cWe want to be one of the biggest four footballing countries globally,\u201d parped Clubs\u2019 Association chairman Goksel Gumusdag. \u201cOur target is to do that by 2020.\u201d  STILL WANT MORE?
