At a rough estimate this means 120 million children were born in 1976. There\u2019s an old joke about an American asking \u201cDo you have children?\u201d, and a British person answering \u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d But it\u2019s not apparently a distinction that your editors are aware of.Vivian CookColchester \u2022 The case for a universal national DNA database has once again been made by the case of Melanie Road, killed over 30 years ago, but whose murder has only recently been solved following the fluke sampling of the killer\u2019s daughter\u2019s DNA after she was arrested for criminal damage (Report, 10 May). Of course a compulsory DNA database invades individual privacy but, provided there are adequate safeguards, I believe it is a price well worth paying to remedy the gross inadequacies in the justice system.Benedict BirnbergLondon \u2022 Mea culpa, Jenny Brook (Letters, 10\u00a0May). Straining for effect as I was, I used words which I would never have applied to my clients over 48 years of practice (\u201cjail fodder\u201d, \u201cnuisance value\u201d). Prisoners are flawed human beings as are we all, striving like us given half a chance to forge out a meaningful life. My essential message, though, remains intact.Malcolm FowlerSolicitor and higher court advocate, Tipton, West Midlands \u2022 Your fashion feature (Hot style hacks, G2, 9 May) says \u201cTake a hard look at last summer\u2019s shoes. Do you have a pair of leather gladiator sandals? They\u2019ll work for another summer, won\u2019t they? Sorry, no. Absolutely not.\u201d I see \u201cKeep it in the ground\u201d has died the death.Melinda DraytonHalifax \u2022 The king who died at Bosworth was Norman, not English (Letters, 9 May). The last English king was Harold Godwinson. The last one with a legitimate claim to the throne was probably Edward the Confessor.Rodney SmithChapelton, South Lanarkshire  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
