Along with plenty of other tricks from the playbook of Crosby Textor, the Australian strategists who make a habit of winning elections in lots of places. Dead-cat theory was first explained in an unguarded column by Boris Johnson three years ago, where he simultaneously defended bankers\u2019 bonuses and dobbed in \u201cmy Australian friend\u201d Lynton Crosby, the mastermind of Johnson\u2019s two successive victories in the London mayoralty race against the grain.  \u201cLet us suppose you are losing an argument. The facts are overwhelmingly against you, and the more people focus on the reality the worse it is for you and your case. Your best bet in these circumstances is to perform a manoeuvre that a great campaigner describes as \u2018throwing a dead cat on the table, mate\u2019,\u201d wrote Johnson.  \u201cThat is because there is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the dining room table \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean that people will be outraged, alarmed, disgusted. That is true, but irrelevant \u2026 everyone will shout \u2018Jeez, mate, there\u2019s a dead cat on the table!\u2019; in other words they will be talking about the dead cat, the thing you want them to talk about, and they will not be talking about the issue that has been causing you so much grief.\u201d And so, with the chutzpah of a self-made multimillionaire in the heat of an election campaign, Malcolm Turnbull suggested on Thursday that Bill Shorten\u2019s attack on Peter Dutton was \u201ca means of distracting from [David] Feeney\u2019s rather careless accounting for his real estate interests\u201d.  But if anyone was swinging a dead cat, it was surely Dutton. Feeney\u2019s offence, serious enough, was a little local difficulty in anybody\u2019s book. But whether by accident or by design (a fascinating exchange between Mark Textor, Crosby\u2019s partner and Liberal election guru, and Guardian Australia\u2019s Katharine Murphy was opaque on this point) Dutton\u2019s comments managed to dominate a day and some of the next after a positively feline interjection into the election debate.  With the campaign not going altogether to the government\u2019s plan, Dutton was given a free hit from Sky News\u2019 Paul Murray about the Greens\u2019 plans to allow 50,000 more refugees to come to Australia. \u201cThese people would be taking Australian jobs, there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cFor many of them that would be unemployed, they would languish in unemployment queues and on Medicare and the rest of it, so there would be huge cost and there\u2019s no sense in sugar-coating that, that\u2019s the scenario.\u201d            Labor hit back. Shorten condemned the remarks as insulting. Turnbull defended his minister. Refugee campaigners were outraged. The media \u2013 including Guardian Australia \u2013 followed the row all day. Fact-checks were commissioned and Dutton was found wanting. Perhaps the most compelling rebuke was in a 2011 study for Dutton\u2019s own department: \u201cHumanitarian entrants help meet labour shortages, including in low-skill and low-paid occupations. They display strong entrepreneurial qualities compared with other migrant groups, with a higher than average proportion engaging in small and medium business enterprises.\u201d Meanwhile a survey commissioned by Amnesty International arrived on Thursday which happily found that Australians appeared to be far more welcoming of refugees than the cabinet minister had indicated. Karl Stefanovic, the Nine News presenter, quoted that same departmental study and, in a rare break into politics, condemned Dutton\u2019s remarks as \u201cun-Australian\u201d.  But that cat was still on the table.  Dutton\u2019s remarks, on late-night Sky News, hardly count as a keynote election address. But they are at one with the Liberals\u2019 campaign strategy, which is to play immigration and asylum for all its worth, arguably in the belief that it will work particularly well in hard-pressed marginals.  \u201cWe know why they\u2019re talking about this every day. We understand why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d said Shorten. Three of the last four videos on the Liberals\u2019 YouTube site are short pops at Labor over boat turnbacks, arguing essentially that it is soft on the issue because some of the party\u2019s candidates are uneasy about a regime where some of the world\u2019s neediest people are languishing in offshore detention. Egged on by a complicit News Corp, which daily finds Labor candidates who want to leave the party \u201call at sea over boats\u201d. At a point where the issue could be about to die away for a little while, Turnbull popped up in Fairfax Media to defend his minister\u2019s \u201cstatement of fact\u201d.          Liberal party film on YouTube.    One of the other Liberal campaign manoeuvres of the last week is to play up the prospect of the Greens forming a coalition with Labor, egged on again by a helpful media. This worked well enough too, stunningly so, during the 2015 UK election, when the Conservatives\u2019 lethal tactic was to gee up speculation about whether the opposition Labour party would have to make a deal with the Scottish Nationalists \u2013 at the same time as SNP was destroying Labor\u2019s strength in Scotland.  This kind of campaigning reached a crescendo when the UK\u2019s Tory defence minister, Michael Fallon, a somewhat more urbane version of Dutton with some of the same instincts, said Ed Miliband had \u201cstabbed his own brother in the back\u201d to become Labour leader and would therefore do the same to Britain\u2019s defences. Then, as with Turnbull, the party leader (in that case David Cameron) defended the minister staunchly and endorsed the argument without quite using the same words. No matter, the job was done. Softened up, Cameron \u2013 and Crosby \u2013 went for the jugular on economic management, a move that will (more defensibly) follow from Turnbull this time.    Related: 'It's ugly and dangerous': the inside story of the battle to be London mayor    How successful these tactics will be this time around is yet to be determined. Maybe Karl Stefanovic spoke for Australia. In London, Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan has just defeated Zac Goldsmith after an ugly Conservative campaign which tried to associate the Muslim Khan with terror attacks on London. That campaign, run by Crosby and Textor\u2019s business partner Mark Fullbrook, floundered so badly that by the end mainstream Conservatives were distancing themselves from it. But it had some of the same mixture of this Australian campaign, inflected and infected with fear and some xenophobia.  Politics is a rough business. No one is asking the Liberals to put Mary Poppins in charge of election strategy. But in this year of Trump and the ongoing global refugee crisis, words matter. This sneaky, back-of-the-hand play to the base\u2019s worst instincts does Turnbull\u2019s campaign little credit. The strategy is exportable. It may be effective. It\u2019s not edifying.",
