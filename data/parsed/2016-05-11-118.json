It\u2019s a curious thing to have a politician referencing the photographic scourge of high-wattage celebrities. I might not have polling data from Nate Silver to back this up, but I\u2019m certain the average tabloid reader isn\u2019t foaming at the mouth to see candid photos of Mitch McConnell sunbathing. Trump\u2019s statement is even odder when you consider that the object of that paparazzi attention includes Paul Ryan \u2013 a man who, in addition to looking like the manager of a Subway sandwich shop on a college campus, is an unsuccessful vice-presidential nominee and the public face of a Congress with a 79% disapproval rating, according to a recent Gallup poll.

That doesn't make it a good idea | Zach Stafford    His rise from \u201cguy you avoid eye contact with at the gym\u201d to major player in the 2016 presidential election is remarkable, but it\u2019s the direct result of what I like to call the Trumpian Illusion (which sounds like the title of an episode of the original Star Trek series) \u2013 anyone who isn\u2019t Donald Trump automatically looks 10 years older and wiser next to the burnt orange diaper-man. Sure, when Paul Ryan smiles, you think he\u2019s recently spiked the punch at a nearby high school prom. And yes, he\u2019s against women\u2019s reproductive rights, tax increases for the wealthiest Americans, and the lawfully enacted healthcare program derisively referred to as Obamacare. He\u2019s never discussed the size of his own genitals in a public political speech, so he gains gravitas points by default. In a way, Paul Ryan reminds me of former Democratic vice-presidential nominee John Edwards. Before he committed an unforgivable act of infidelity against his dying wife, Elizabeth, Edwards was seen as a shining light of the progressive movement. He was plain-spoken, with a populist message against income inequality that resonated with voters in 2004. By the 2008 presidential primary, he had honed that message into the catchy \u201ctwo Americas\u201d stump speech. He was handsome in a Kennedy-esque sort of way, a face Democrats just can\u2019t help themselves over when they are confronted with it in the flesh. They start salivating uncontrollably and temporarily lose all motor skills. The problem Edwards had is that he wasn\u2019t nearly as charming or appealing as the party apparatus wanted to believe he was. He didn\u2019t have enough experience to topple John Kerry with a primary electorate that craved a Washington insider to embarrass George W Bush, though he was able to squeeze on to the ticket as Kerry\u2019s running mate. His performance against Dick Cheney in the debates that year didn\u2019t wow anyone, but he carried on. In 2008, his lauded rhetorical skills paled in comparison to the once-in-a-lifetime oratorical genius of Barack Obama. He might have looked like a president, but he wasn\u2019t a president. Paul Ryan has that same sheen of the generically handsome \u2013 walking and talking like a robot sent from the future to bomb Iran. If the Tea Party of 2012 could have created a test-tube candidate in a lab, it would have looked exactly like Paul Ryan. His has the face of a man who never even considered premarital sex let alone condoned it. Truly, that is the visage of a guy who DVRs reruns of Matlock and eats pudding from a plastic cup. I assume that when he works out, he\u2019s not listening to EDM or podcasts, but the sound of the mighty Mississippi river rushing or the incessant caw of the majestic bald eagle. Looking like he should be important has allowed him to continually fail upwards in politics. They say dress for the job you want, but Paul Ryan took it a step further and was simply born like that. In true American style, he\u2019s blundered his way to prominence \u2013 first as a freshman congressman, then a disastrous vice-presidential nominee, and now an unpopular speaker of the House. At this rate, Speaker Ryan has a decent shot of being named Supreme Galactic Emperor before his time is up. Trump has shown no particular interest in moderating his stance. In that same New York Times article, he\u2019s quoted as saying: \u201cYou win the pennant and now you\u2019re in the World Series \u2013 you gonna change? People like the way I\u2019m doing.\u201d He uses his electoral mandate as justification for telling the GOP establishment to lock themselves in a panic room until November. The only hope of the congressional contingent is that Paul Ryan channels his inner Subway manager \u2013 firm, resolute, unyielding. Just like the manager of a Subway will tell you over and over again that avocado is extra; that they are definitely out of Italian herb and cheese bread; and that yes, the bathroom is for customers only, Paul Ryan must stand up to Donald Trump \u2013 the very definition of an entitled, pushy fast-food customer who thinks the world owes him extra cheese. History will either remember Paul Ryan for being an underachieving vessel for rightwing talking points or an honorable man who refused to be bullied by Donald Trump. It\u2019s entirely up to him.",
