  "body": "A man has denied raping the student Hannah Stubbs, who killed herself while police investigated the alleged crime. Stubbs, 22, took her own life six months after reporting the alleged attack at Keele University. Elgan Varney, a 32-year-old student at the same university, appeared at Stoke crown court on Friday. Dressed in a white shirt and black tie he denied two counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.  One allegation of rape relates to the period between 1 October 2014 and 31 December 2014 and the other between 1 and 28 February 2015. Varney, of Clayton, Staffordshire, also pleaded not guilty to sexual assault on 27 February 2015. Varney was charged last month and appeared at Newcastle-under-Lyme magistrates court on 7 April. He is on unconditional bail and is suspended from university until the outcome of the case. A trial is listed for 24 October and expected to last one week.  An inquest into Stubbs\u2019s death at Staffordshire coroners court on 29 March recorded a narrative verdict, saying the suicide followed post-traumatic stress disorder. Stubbs, a former pupil at St Dominic\u2019s priory, a top Catholic school, died on 29 August 2015.",
