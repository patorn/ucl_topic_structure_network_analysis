  "body": "Frieda Hughes is thumbing through her first book of poetry, trying to find the poem she wrote about the poems her father, Ted Hughes, wrote about her mother, Sylvia Plath. \u201cIt\u2019s called Birds. It describes the poet as a penguin, nursing the egg his wife has left him, and the skuas that kill and feed on baby penguins. I wrote it about my father and Birthday Letters [the collection of poems Hughes wrote in response to Plath\u2019s suicide]. But when my father read it, he said he thought it was a poem about me. I look at it now and think he\u2019s right.\u201d Her voice, as she reads the poem aloud, is deep and low; eerily resonant of the voice of her mother, who was recorded reading her Ariel poems a few months before her death. She gassed herself in an oven in the middle of the night, leaving out bread and milk as breakfast for the sleeping Frieda and her one-year-old brother. Frieda was almost three at the time. She is 56 now and we are sitting by the fire in the lounge of her old Welsh farmhouse, eating delicious homemade banana cake and drinking tea. Every inch of every wall is covered with her dramatic, large oil paintings of birds and abstract shapes. Her father loved her paintings, she says. He also liked her poetry and encouraged her to write, although she didn\u2019t allow him to read any of her poems until she was 34. By then, she had been secretly writing poetry for a decade, filing it away in a shoebox. \u201cI came to him with a stack of my poetry that was several inches high and asked him to put them into three piles: good, bad and indifferent. And he did \u2013 he put several into each category. He was quite good at being impartial and, with poetry, he was supremely impartial. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me what I should change. He said: \u2018These I don\u2019t think warrant anything, these ones could be worked on and these ones I really like as they are.\u2019 But, inevitably, even the ones he really liked as they were, I did loads of work on anyway.\u201d She hid her poetry from her father and everyone else in her life out of a desire to develop her own voice. \u201cI had a fear of similarity. I wanted to be judged on my own merits.\u201d Instead, she wrote children\u2019s books and had six published. Then, at 34, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue, and all she wanted to do with her few waking hours was to paint huge oil paintings and write poetry. The experience changed how she felt about following in her parents\u2019 footsteps. \u201cWe only have one life. If we live an awful lot of it not doing something that would make us very happy, hurts no one and might actually be worth something in the general scheme of things, it\u2019s pretty sad if we don\u2019t do it, just because we might get our heads kicked in.\u201d She has never sat down to write a poem and thought, my parents were so good at this. \u201cIf that thought even crossed my mind, it would paralyse me.\u201d She didn\u2019t even want to read any of her parents\u2019 poetry until she was in her mid-30s and had finished writing her first collection; she had sought and received special dispensation to avoid studying their work at school. \u201cI always felt their poetry would contaminate me in some way. By contaminate, I mean influence my poetry. I absolutely did not want to copy them. Also, my parents were Mum and Dad. Why would I want to turn them into something other that I studied from a distance? If I didn\u2019t read their poetry, they would always be Mum and Dad, not these great literary luminaries.\u201d Her father used to disappear to write: \u201cHe worked a lot. He had a very powerful work ethic \u2013 he was very disciplined.\u201d    In my \u00adexperience, running away from sadness doesn't do anybody any good    But she also remembers him cooking her scrambled eggs, taking her to the beach and going for walks across Dartmoor. \u201cI had a lot of freedom as a child \u2013 I used to run a bit wild. I was happiest roaming free in the sun, in a field, with an animal of some kind.\u201d This doesn\u2019t surprise me. After my arrival, she patiently fed minced up chunks of a dead chick to Sammy, her fluffy Eurasian eagle owlet, using chopsticks. She owns nine owls \u2013 along with two dogs, two rabbits, two chickens, six chinchillas, nine ferrets and a snake. When Hughes gave into curiosity and read their poetry, did it reveal anything about her parents she didn\u2019t already know? \u201cNo, but when I read what other people had written about my mother, it was quite a shock to find that she wasn\u2019t angelic because that was how my father had presented her. He never said a bad thing about my mother, ever.\u201d She is full of admiration for her mother\u2019s work, especially Ariel, and equally in awe of her father\u2019s poetry. Her favourite poem of his is Full Moon and Little Frieda. Her mother also wrote about her in Morning Song. \u201cI like their poems about me, basically,\u201d she says, and laughs. She has written several moving poems about her parents in Alternative Values, her latest collection of paintings and poetry. This, she says, is her way of reclaiming her parents\u2019 very public relationship: \u201cWhen I was younger, I used to feel my parents had been a bit stolen, by being reinvented by other people \u2026 My parents are my life. Not yours, not someone else\u2019s, they are mine. If I want to write about them, it\u2019s my prerogative.\u201d Many of the poems in Alternative Values explore themes of death and loss, and some of the strongest and most powerful touch on the period shortly before and after her mother\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s me talking with my younger self who couldn\u2019t talk to people then. It\u2019s giving the child that I was a voice that I never allowed myself to have. I couldn\u2019t have done that in my first book of poems or even the second, partly because my father was still alive. Daddy wouldn\u2019t have minded but \u2026 I wasn\u2019t ready. And had I thought more deeply about being more personal then, that is where possibly the weight of the success of my parents would have been a consideration. It would have been like: oh, they\u2019re my parents and here I am being deeply personal about all the newsy stuff.\u201d     Frieda with her father, Ted, and brother Nicolas in Connemara, 1966. Photograph: Jane Bown    Yet writing a poem about something painful, she has discovered, can be her way of digesting it. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned is, if we try and put sadness off, it just waits. And in my experience, running away from sadness doesn\u2019t do anybody any good.\u201d If anyone has reason to understand this, it is Hughes. Ten years after her father died, her brother Nicholas hanged himself. She never wanted to have children, she says, so she didn\u2019t, although she has married and divorced three times. Yet she comes across as an overwhelmingly positive person who sees the losses she has suffered as a way of reminding herself she is still alive and had better do something worthwhile with her life. \u201cI have a real consciousness that I will never get today back. Today is going to be as good or as bad as I make it.\u201d At the same time, she says, you can\u2019t ignore the fact that we\u2019re all going to die. \u201cSo always be prepared. Always give the one last kiss. Always tell somebody you love them. Always, always.\u201d \u2022 Hear Frieda Hughes in conversation at The Ageas, Salisbury international arts festival on 7 June, salisburyfestival.co.uk",
