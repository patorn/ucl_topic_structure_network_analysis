Evans said the \u201cwhole competition thing is hilarious\u201d when asked about comparisons between the revamped BBC2 motoring show and Clarkson\u2019s new series on Amazon Prime. Clarkson will reunite with his former Top Gear colleagues Richard Hammond and James May in The Grand Tour, due to debut on Amazon in the autumn after they signed a reported \u00a3160m deal.   Related: Inside the new Top Gear: nerves, fluffed lines and good-natured banter    \u201cThis whole competition thing is hilarious, it\u2019s not just me being a diplomat,\u201d Evans said this week. \u201cTV is not competitive any more, it\u2019s only us old people who think you have to watch things when they are on. Linear broadcasting is going out of the window, and Clarkson\u2019s show isn\u2019t on a linear broadcaster anyway.\u201d He added: \u201cThey do what they do and we do what we do, which is some of what they used to do [on Top Gear],\u201d he said. \u201cWe would be stupid to throw away the masterpieces and formats and production values that they brought to the table. \u201cIf you inherit an old building, like a castle or something, you don\u2019t knock it down, you say where does it leak and you fix it. Basically we put a glass roof on it.\u201d Evans said he will be disappointed with anything fewer than 5 million viewers for the show\u2019s return in the UK. Within 72 hours it will also have been shown in more than 80 countries on six continents.  Does Evans think Clarkson and co will be watching? \u201cI am definitely going to watch their show so I would presume they are going to watch ours,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir show is going to be great because they are good at what they do.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d The eagerly awaited first episode comes just short of a year since the Radio 2 breakfast presenter was handed the long-running motoring show following Clarkson\u2019s departure after a \u201cfracas\u201d with a producer.     Top Gear: Chris Evans and a Zenos E10S. Photograph: Mark Yeoman/BBC Worldwide/Mark Yeoman    The intervening months have seen reports of tension between Evans and his co-presenter, former Friends star Matt LeBlanc, allegations of bullying dating back 20 years and suggestions that the Radio 2 DJ was \u201cout of control\u201d. \u201cNonsense,\u201d said Evans at the programme\u2019s global launch at the Surrey aerodrome where it is filmed this week. \u201cNone of it was true, but there\u2019s no point saying that, there\u2019s just no point.\u201d \u201cIn many ways my job for this year has been not only to make this show but to take all the shit, which was going to happen. I knew I was going to get the shit kicked out of me.\u201d Viewers can expect the new series to be familiar, but different. Instead of one star driving a \u201creasonably priced car\u201d around the Top Gear track, two celebrities will drive a souped-up Mini Cooper around a track extended to include a rally section complete with water and a jump. Two of the three films which will feature in the first episode certainly had echoes of its old incarnation \u2013 two muscle cars with laser guns attached to the top, and a preposterous off-roader being chased by a drone, a motorbike and a giant fan-powered parachute. Evans said the films were \u201clike mini movies. That\u2019s what people want. I want the show to be happy escapism, it\u2019s a hopes and dreams show. Maybe you haven\u2019t got one of these cars but you can imagine, let\u2019s live in that world for a while, especially on a Sunday night.\u201d           Top Gear\u2019s The Stig: the Guardian\u2019s hard-hitting interview    But in a change to its previous form, the new Top Gear appears to have embraced the electric car. Jeremy Clarkson, look away now. At its peak, the programme drew 8.4 million viewers for an appearance by Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton in 2007, eclipsing the 8.1 million who watched Hammond\u2019s return from his high speed car crash. The lowest series average of the Clarkson years was its first, 3.1 million viewers in 2002. It ended last year \u2013 its 22nd series \u2013 with an average of 6.4 million viewers. Evans said he would be \u201cdisappointed\u201d with fewer than 5 million: \u201cFive million-plus would be great, after that it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d There is much more resting on the show than just the overnight ratings of BBC2. The BBC\u2019s most valuable property, Top Gear is worth an estimated \u00a350m to the corporation\u2019s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, one of its top tier of shows that include Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing.",
