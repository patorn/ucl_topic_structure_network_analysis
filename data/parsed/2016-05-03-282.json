Does it really matter who wins trophies when an increasing number of players are struggling to cope with the intense mental strain of professional sport? Rugby union is not alone in having participants who suffer from depression but to what extent, if any, is the game itself to blame for the apparent rise in unhappiness? The testimonies of the former Scotland international Rory Lamont and the England prop Joe Marler in the Sunday Times over the weekend were striking. Lamont, in a particularly brave statement, admitted to having suicidal thoughts since retiring through injury in 2013. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t want to live like this. I\u2019d rather die. Maybe if I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ll get struck by lightning or step in front of a bus.\u2019 Coming out of rugby, my world pretty much collapsed.\u201d   Related: Rugby union: talking points from the weekend\u2019s Premiership action    Even now he still suffers sharp ankle pain, suspects the painkillers he took to assist his recovery from multiple operations may have affected his digestion system and has found it hard to cope outside the safety blanket of a club environment. Most pertinent of all was his first-hand account of how players find it almost impossible to admit to vulnerability, whether it be mental or physical. \u201cRugby is great at masking insecurities,\u201d Lamont told his interviewer, Mark Palmer. \u201cYou get this bullet-proof vest: you\u2019re part of a team, everyone\u2019s telling you you\u2019re great. But it\u2019s just a comfort blanket. \u201cOnce that\u2019s removed, you\u2019re that little child, completely scared, totally vulnerable and very much on your own. I wasn\u2019t always in love with rugby, but I was surrounded by friends, travelling the world. Suddenly everything was gone. I felt like a spent battery, tossed on the scrapheap.\u201d The case of Marler is not so extreme but, in its own way, is equally revealing. His agent approached the Sunday Times with the obvious aim of altering perceptions about his client after a difficult couple of months but Marler had a whole load of stuff to get off his chest. Among other things, the Harlequin front-rower revealed he has sought professional help in a bid to make himself calmer on the field. Marler is, hopefully, years away from retirement but, at 25, he felt he was losing control of himself, not least prior to his latest flashpoint against Grenoble. \u201cIn the first half I had lost it completely. You can see me running round as if looking for something \u2026 I know that things have gone too far.\u201d The first step to solving a problem, as everyone knows, is to admit you have one in the first place. Hats off to Marler for summoning up the courage to make that decision and best wishes to both him and Lamont as they strike out for happier shores. We are not talking here about the routine daily frustrations of sport: not getting picked, getting injured or contractual uncertainty. As Lamont makes clear there can be less obvious triggers, not least the knock-on effects of a \u201cbravado culture\u201d where the relationship between \u201cus against the world\u201d competitive aggression and normal life starts to curdle. The former Bath and England prop Duncan Bell, the ex-Sale and Lions hooker Andy Titterrell, the former Oxford University and Sale flanker John Carter; all have had to wrestle with mental health issues either during or following their careers. Titterrell began to suffer after he moved from Sale and believes \u201ca lot of my depression stemmed from rugby\u201d. Carter has written about how he \u201cfelt bereft and empty, searching for something that had disappeared\u201d after he was forced to hang up his boots. All are now doing their best to help and educate others and turn their own tough experiences into something more positive. The Rugby Players\u2019 Association has a 24-hour hotline \u2013 01373 858080 \u2013 for any members who think they may need help.

I happen to know the family of a professional footballer entering the final stages of his career. As Old Father Time creeps up on him, the abuse he receives on social media when his team loses can often be sickening. Never mind he has played more than 500 professional games, nor that he has been a loyal servant to numerous clubs. If you are heading to an end-of-season game this week, spare a thought for the more vulnerable gladiators wrestling with their unseen demons. Put yourself in their boots as they seek to justify another contract and keep food on the family table. Not such an easy life, is it? FRIENDLY FIRE Giving his players the benefit of the doubt in defeat is not a speciality of Toulon\u2019s president Mourad Boudjellal. Let\u2019s just say his side\u2019s loss to Toulouse, and particularly the efforts of their tight forwards, did not go down well. \u201cIn 10 years of presidency, never have a front five made me so ashamed,\u201d he told Midi Olympique. \u201cOur front five didn\u2019t show, they were somewhere else. Perhaps it was their lookalikes, who knows? It\u2019s especially true for our Fijian tight-head. I had the impression he was swapped during the week.\u201d Who needs enemies when you have an employer as supportive as Boudjellal. ONE TO WATCH Both the Premiership and the Pro12 have reached the final round of regular season matches. In the Premiership, Saturday\u2019s game at the Stoop between Harlequins and Exeter will determine who finishes second in the league, as well as helping to clarify European qualification for next season. In the Pro12 it looks as if all four Irish provinces could make the 2016-17 Champions Cup but the play-off permutations remain decidedly fluid. The fifth-placed Scarlets could do with winning in Munster but would also love their neighbours Ospreys to do them a favour at home to Ulster.",
