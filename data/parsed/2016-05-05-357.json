It was also revealed that a large portion of the reallocated money will not be available for the reef until 2019, coinciding with when Unesco is scheduled to reconsider whether to categorise the reef as \u201cin danger\u201d. Under questioning from the Greens senator Larissa Waters, the recycled nature of the money was confirmed by the cabinet minister Simon Birmingham and government officials in Senate estimates on Thursday. In a press release from Tuesday\u2019s budget, the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said: \u201cThe Turnbull government is doing more than ever before to protect the Great Barrier Reef and the 2016 budget strengthens this commitment with a $171.0 million boost.\u201d But $101m of that money is being taken from the National Landcare Program. For the first three years, that will only amount to $8.9m a year, jumping to $32.7m from the financial year 2020-21. That money comes from a pool that has not yet been allocated in the National Landcare Program. But within the National Landcare Program, hundreds of millions of dollars have previously been spent on improving water quality on the Great Barrier Reef, and whether money from that program was going to be spent on the reef from 2019 onwards had not yet been determined. The other $70m for the reef has been taken from a capping of programs within the Green Army. Again, Green Army programs have already been contributing significantly towards Great Barrier Reef conservation. In 2015, for example, almost 10% of announced Green Army Programs were directed at the reef\u2019s conservation. Of that $70m, none of it will be available to the reef until 2019, when $40m will be allocated to water quality programs, followed by two years of $15m funding. With the old and new announcements combined, in the 2016-17 period, the federal government will be spending $58.8m on the Reef 2050 Plan, which intends to improve water quality. In response to questions about the recycling of the money, Birmingham said the $171m was new money \u201cfor the reef\u201d, since it had not yet been allocated for the reef or for anything else. \u201cIn a budget that keeps more than $20bn in subsidies to fossil fuels and gives $100m in new money to mining exploration, it\u2019s an indictment on the government that there is no new money for the reef that doesn\u2019t come at the expense of other environment programs,\u201d Waters said in a statement.  \u201cWe are in an extinction and climate crisis \u2013 now is not the time for more environment funding cuts.\u201d Meanwhile, the Queensland government is investing $57.5m in 2016-17 period. \u201cThat means that the commonwealth is only investing $1.3m more than the Queensland government,\u201d said Imogen Zethoven, from the Australian Marine Conservation Society. \u201cIf the commonwealth was serious about fixing the water quality problems in the reef, it would provide twice, three times or even four times the amount that the Queensland government is providing,\u201d she said. The lack of new money for the environment or the Great Barrier Reef comes despite new money being announced that will assist miners. Some $100m of brand new money was given to Geoscience Australia to assist miners in exploration for minerals and groundwater, a move which was applauded by the Minerals Council of Australia, which described the budget as a \u201cblueprint for growth\u201d. \u201cA key driver for the next phase of Australia\u2019s exploration effort is the fact that 80% of the continent, covered by rocks and sediment, remains largely unexplored,\u201d the council said in a press release. \u201cThis will propel a step-change in knowledge and technology, which will facilitate exploration by private companies in areas that have historically been difficult to explore.\u201d All of the money announced for the reef was focusing on water quality on the reef, with the budget remaining silent on climate change, which the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has said is the most serious risk facing the reef and which is causing the current bleaching crisis. Responding to the budget, the Greens leader, Senator Richard Di Natale, said there was no new money for renewable energy, and the government had already announced more than $1bn would be removed from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t see the jobs of the 21st century in building wind turbines and public transport \u2013 they see them in building military hardware,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cWhile subsidies continue to flow to the fossil fuel industry, more than a billion dollars is being ripped out of clean energy.\u201d",
