  "body": "It was one of David Bowie\u2019s favourite records. That may be as much of a recommendation as anyone needs, but Bowie\u2019s fulsome appreciation of The Glory of the Human Voice, the deliciously ironic title for RCA\u2019s release of Florence Foster Jenkins\u2019s recordings, is itself a wonderful distillation of the Florence phenomenon: \u201cShe had and was blissfully unaware of, the worst set of pipes in the world of music \u2026 Be afraid, be very afraid\u201d.  You\u2019d have to be very brave or very stupid to go against Bowie\u2019s opinions. Thankfully, I\u2019m both, and on the eve of Stephen Frears\u2019s new film that celebrates her life, and her climactic 1944 performance at Carnegie Hall, it\u2019s time for a little perspective on the Florence story.         Florence Foster Jenkins sings Adele\u2019s Laughing Song\u201d from Die Fledermaus     For a start, to make your public debut anywhere as a singer at the age of 76 is a terrifying prospect; to do it at Carnegie Hall, New York\u2019s prestigious concert venue, requires astonishing reserves of self-confidence, and quite possibly, self-deception. She might have been a truly terrible singer, but Florence Foster Jenkins was musically talented. There, I said it. As a child, she was touted as a piano prodigy, played her first public recital at the age of eight, and as \u201cLittle Miss Foster\u201d performed at the White House for President Rutherford B Hayes.  Her devotion to music led to her break from her family: her wealthy father refused to sanction further musical study, so she eloped with a much older man, who she married aged 17 or 18. The union was a disaster, not least because she contracted syphilis from her husband (treatment for the disease would make her completely bald in later life). As a newly single woman she supported herself by teaching piano but that career collapsed, however, after an arm injury meant she couldn\u2019t play. It was only through her mother, and then her father\u2019s inheritance after his death in 1909, that Florence started her transformation into the grandiose grande dame of Manhattan society. As St Clair Bayfield wrote (Bayfield became her common-law husband and manager), the essence of the Florence Foster Jenkins story was that she never knew what her singing voice was really like. Not because she couldn\u2019t hear it, but because she lived as a legend in her own lifetime. Her annual vocal recitals resounded in a gilded echo chamber of praise, approbation, and acclaim for the brilliance of the Verdi Club\u2019s president. It would have been social suicide in the echelons of Manhattan\u2019s high society for any mere member to risk criticism of their patroness \u2013 and only a handful ever did.      \u2018A legend in her own lifetime.\u2019 David Haig, Meryl Streep and Simon Helberg in Florence Foster Jenkins Photograph: Nick Wall/PR    After her recordings (which have never been out of print) appeared in the early 1940s, she would play her own performances of the Queen of the Night\u2019s Act 2 aria from Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute to her friends alongside versions by genuinely glorious divas Luisa Tetrazzini and Frieda Hempel. Without saying which was which (and my goodness, you really can tell the difference \u2026), she would ask her audience to write down which they preferred. As Donald Collup\u2019s documentary on Florence, A World of Her Own reveals, only one person is known to have demurred from the opinion that hers was the best, and this bravely honest person was promptly castigated by Florence for her lack of taste.     Make no mistake: being this bad is hard.    That Queen of the Night recording is the unimpeachable, incomparable classic of the \u2013 alas \u2013 very small Foster Jenkins discography, with her accompanist, the joyously monikered Cosm\u00e9 McMoon. But the notion that she couldn\u2019t sing a single note in tune or in time is wide of the mark. True, most of her recordings are the right notes in the wrong place, but if you dare to listen to her other recordings, you will discover that Florence did have a very occasional relationship with musical accuracy, which of course only makes the effect of the whole more miraculously hilarious.         Foster Jenkins takes on Mozart. (Mozart wins)    But make no mistake: being this bad is hard. One of the reviews of the Carnegie Hall concert got it right. Robert Bagar in the New York World Telegram wrote: \u201cOf all the singers appearing before the public today, only Mme. Jenkins has perfected the art of giving added zest to a written phrase by improvising it in quarter tones, either above or below the original notes. Think of the difficulties involved in making this possible\u201d. Bagar was right. You try it: those exquisite shadings of pitch and frissons of out-of-tune vibrato are perfectly designed to induce the greatest possible injury to the piece, and to your eardrums. And they are almost impossible to replicate, because what makes them so magical in Florence\u2019s performances is that you can hear that she is really trying for the right note, the right word, the right rhythm.  The truth of is, most of us are more like Florence than we are Tetrazzini, so perhaps we hear some echo of our common humanity in her vocal trials and tribulations. But Florence had something else too: a sheer joy in her performances. Here\u2019s Bagar again: \u201cShe was exceedingly happy in her work. It is a pity that so few artists are, and the happiness was communicated, as if by magic to her hearers\u201d. Florence had a heart attack days after the Carnegie Hall recital \u2013 perhaps induced by reading her reviews \u2013 and she died a month later. But that heroically misplaced happiness in her abilities still communicates today; indelibly, appallingly, magnificently. The \u201cworst set of pipes in the world\u201d? Perhaps not, after all \u2026  Florence Foster Jenkins is on general UK release from Friday 6 May.",
