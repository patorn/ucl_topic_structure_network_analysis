  "body": "Labour\u2019s Gill Furniss has won a comfortable victory in the byelection in Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, with a majority of almost 10,000 on a turnout of 33.2%. Labour also held Ogmore in south Wales with Chris Elmore winning majority of 8,000 on a turnout of 43%. Furniss is the widow of Brightside\u2019s last MP, Harry Harpham, who died of cancer in February after only nine months in the role. She has served as a Labour councillor in the area for 16 years and worked locally as a librarian and hospital administrator. Labour held the seat with 14,087 votes (62%). In second place was the Ukip candidate, Steven Winstone, with 4,497 (22%), followed by the Lib Dems\u2019 Shaffaq Mohammed on 1,385 (6.09%), and the Conservative candidate, Spencer Pitfield, with 1,267 votes (5.57%).           Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018Labour hung on and grew support in a lot of places\u2019    Labour\u2019s share of the vote went up 5.8%. Ukip came second, but their share of the vote was down 2.2%. And the Conservatives saw their share of the vote fall by 5.4%. Furniss paid tribute to her \u201cloving husband\u201d and said he would have wanted her to carry on his work. She said the result had sent an \u201cemphatic message\u201d to David Cameron and his \u201cout of touch and cruel Tory government\u201d.  In her acceptance speech she said: \u201cMr Cameron, we have had enough of your uncaring government. We have had enough of your Tory government\u2019s unfair cuts, which have hit communities like ours in Sheffield so much more than affluent areas.  \u201cWe have had enough of your Tory government giving tax cuts to the rich while taking money away from the disabled and vulnerable. And we have had enough of your Tory government dragging your feet on any help for our steel industry.\u201d  Paying tribute to her late husband, she said he was a \u201cfantastic MP for this constituency\u201d and \u201cwe all miss him a great deal\u201d.  She said: \u201cHis time in parliament was short but he fought with determination to do what was right for local people right to the end. He would have wanted me to stand in this election to carry on his work, both here in Sheffield and in Westminster.\u201d  The area was represented by former Labour home secretary David Blunkett from 1987 until last May\u2019s general election, when Harpham, who worked as Blunkett\u2019s agent for nearly 20 years, stood to replace him. Last May, Harpham won 56.6% of the vote, with Ukip candidate John Booker coming a distant second with 22.1%. The Conservatives came third with 11%, and the Liberal Democrats fourth with 4.5%.

Photograph: Lynne Cameron/Press Association    Speaking to the Guardian earlier this week, Furniss, who has been out campaigning every day since being nominated, described herself as cautiously optimistic that Labour would win. \u201cSheffield is a Labour city,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that there are no Tories on the council. They\u2019re just not trusted in this city.\u201d But she acknowledged that byelections could be unpredictable. \u201cI\u2019ve been out campaigning in this area every May for 20 years. It\u2019s just what we do, what I do, what me and Harry did. He wouldn\u2019t expect anything less of me.\u201d The Ukip candidate, Steven Winstone, a local businessman and scrap metal dealer who was the party\u2019s candidate for Sheffield South East at the general election, said ahead of the vote that his party\u2019s chances in the area had been diminished because the other election battles being fought across the country diverted the party\u2019s limited resources. Winstone, who describes himself as \u201cabout as left as you get for a Ukipper\u201d, said that people in the area \u2013 which is largely white working class \u2013 could be persuaded to vote for his party, but that they tended to vote Labour out of habit.",
