  "body": "In 2013, Lindy West got a message on Twitter from her dead father. \u201cEmbarrassed father of an idiot,\u201d his bio said. But no: \u201cMy dad was never mean. It couldn\u2019t really be\u00a0from him. Also, he was dead \u2013 just 18 months earlier, I\u2019d\u00a0watched him turn grey and drown in his own magnificent lungs.\u201d Someone wanted to hurt her. At that moment in her career, West was fielding daily online harassment for her opposition to rape jokes in standup comedy. \u201cI was eating 30 rape threats for breakfast at that point (or, more accurately, \u2018You\u2019re fatter than the girls I usually rape\u2019 threats),\u201d she writes in this memoir. \u201cNo one could touch me any more.\u201d But that Twitter message was something different: it\u00a0was about her dad. \u201cWhat could I do? It\u2019s not illegal to reach elbow-deep into someone\u2019s safest, sweetest memories and touch them and twist them and weaponise them to\u00a0impress the ghost of Lenny Bruce or\u00a0what-the-fuck-ever.\u201d So she wrote about it. And \u2013 as they say \u2013 you won\u2019t believe what happened next. The tweeter apologised. \u201cIt was the lowest thing I had ever done. When you included it in your latest Jezebel article\u201d \u2013 West was a columnist for the online magazine \u2013 \u201cit finally hit me. There is a\u00a0living, breathing human being who is\u00a0reading this shit.\u201d In a subsequent conversation on the radio programme This American Life, he said (his name isn\u2019t given) he had been overweight, and, as West writes in Shrill, \u201creading about fat people, particularly fat women, accepting and\u00a0loving themselves as they were, infuriated him in ways he couldn\u2019t articulate at the time\u201d. Being a woman means certain men think they have dominion over your body; being a fat woman means they don\u2019t bother to hide it. Fatness thus confers a grim power of discernment, an antenna for character that survives even if you become skinny. Fatness gives you an insight into a world of cruelty many people can\u2019t imagine. I always like to come across the word \u201cfat\u201d in a snug, happy, adjectival nook somewhere. Fat toffees. Fat salary. Fat grin. Fat as something luxurious, friendly, and plentiful rather than gross and wrong. Because fat is normally one\u00a0of the bad words, toxic in its blunt monosyllabic force. Fat can\u2019t be argued with: it is not just an aesthetic condemnation (You\u2019re ugly), it\u2019s a moral condemnation (You\u2019re lazy). Online, it is spat at women like machine-gun fire. In the real world, \u201cfat\u201d is often replaced with simpering euphemisms such as zaftig, Rubenesque, big, heavy \u2013 with the implication that \u201cfat\u201d is so bad it is literally unspeakable. But West is a witty, joyfully vulgar, and, yes, fat writer unwilling to accept the story that her body is shameful. \u201cEvery cell in my body would rather be\u00a0\u2018fat\u2019 than \u2018big\u2019,\u201d she writes. If being a fat woman gives you a front-row seat on human cruelty, being a woman who writes on the internet pushes you into the arena with the lions. People reveal themselves to you\u00a0when there is no accountability: behind a screen, you can say almost anything. \u201cKill yourself, dumb bitch\u201d: if you have experienced bias or harassment, talking openly about it will almost certainly bring you more. This is how it goes: let\u2019s say somebody makes a\u00a0rape joke. You object. So people make\u00a0more rape jokes, except this time they\u2019re about you. You object more loudly. Rape jokes are now rape threats, and they\u2019re pouring in, a flood of them, every day, except some of them say, \u201cYou\u2019re too fat to rape\u201d, or \u201cKill yourself, pig lady\u201d, because the internet is\u00a0a\u00a0place where your most private self is up for mauling, where the rules for how to treat other people don\u2019t apply. You push on, even with the grim certainty that describing your pain will invite more. And more pour in, multiplying and multiplying. It is now your job to be mad about it. That is what happened to West. \u201cI\u00a0never wanted internet trolls to be my\u00a0beat,\u201d she writes. \u201cI wanted to write feminist polemics, jokes about wizards and love letters to John Goodman\u2019s meaty, sexual forearms.\u201d Her pain, her body, her fear \u2013 these are now her beats.     \u2018Fat, loud, irrational, violent, overbearing\u2019 \u2013 the Queen of Hearts. Photograph: Allstar/Walt Disney    West\u2019s range is wide. Shrill\u2019s early chapters flash with wild, exuberant profanity. She opens with a riff on fat\u00a0fictional characters, such as the Queen of Hearts from Disney\u2019s Alice in\u00a0Wonderland \u2013 \u201cfat, loud, irrational, violent, overbearing, constantly hitting a hedgehog with a flamingo. Oh, shit. She taught me everything I know.\u201d She\u00a0tackles not just trolls but puberty (\u201ca\u00a0fancy word for your genitals stabbing you in the back\u201d) and early years spent trying to hide her body (\u201cI didn\u2019t go swimming for a fucking decade\u201d). Later, she becomes more sober and personal, writing about her father\u2019s death and her love for her husband. Shrill mixes humour with pathos so effectively that\u00a0those qualities magnify each other rather than cancelling each other out. West has somehow stayed open and vulnerable in the face of constant attack, abuse that would turn a lot of people into a brittle shell, instead of a\u00a0warm, capacious and funny writer. West has made a bargain: paying a\u00a0price in terms of time and mental health for a chance at fighting both the\u00a0shadowy beast that is\u00a0sexist culture and the specific beasts filling her inbox with injunctions to suicide. She knows that in order to do it, she is offering herself up as a sacrifice to them, the beasts who eat your softest and most vulnerable parts and leave you bleeding. She does it because she thinks she can make it better. I hope she\u2019s right. I\u00a0think she is. \u2022 To order a copy for \u00a312.99 (RRP \u00a316.99), go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&p over \u00a310, online orders only.
