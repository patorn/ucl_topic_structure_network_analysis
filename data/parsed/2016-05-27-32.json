  "body": "Alex Hales believes he is improving as a Test cricketer by the day even if he was left frustrated by seeing the chance to become England\u2019s first centurion in all three international formats halted in the 80s for the second week running. The right-handed opener has tasted three figures on both the Twenty20 and 50-over stages but, by comparison, remains in the foothills of his Test career, adapting his game to one that can produce innings of substance against the red ball at the highest level. A watchful 86 in the first Test against Sri Lanka, compiled over five and a half hours at the crease, was backed up here in Chester-le-Street with a more fluent 83 from 145 balls that was ended when a straight six, his 10th boundary of the innings, was followed by an edge to slip when trying to cut the spinner Milinda Siriwardana. While it took a stunning one-handed catch by the Sri Lanka captain, Angelo Mathews, to remove him Hales took the moment itself as a lesson learned in his development as he looks to cement his place in the Test side this summer following a chastening first series in the 2-1 win against South Africa during the winter. \u201cIt was a combination of surprise, frustration and anger when he held the catch,\u201d the 27-year-old said after stumps. \u201cI was disappointed to get out in the 80s again. I probably lost my shape a bit and maybe the adrenaline got the better of me as I tried to lamp it for four. But you live and learn. As an opener, when you put in the hard yards you want to cash in and get hundreds because, facing the new ball, there will be single-figure scores. \u201cI can\u2019t get complacent. It was only a few games ago I was averaging 17 in South Africa and there were questions over my spot. But I feel in good touch and hopefully I can nail down my place in all three formats. I still feel like I\u2019m improving every day as a red-ball cricketer.\u201d The catch by Mathews was one of four stunners held by the tourists on the first day, with their head coach, Graham Ford, paying tribute to their character both in bouncing back from the innings-defeat in Leeds and when practising in cold conditions before this second fixture at Test cricket\u2019s most northerly ground.

The fielding came good and that\u2019s down to their efforts in training [Mathews] very sharp at slip and it was pure reflex to remove Hales but all those catches were excellent \u2013 those moments help energise the troops and get them going a little more. They deserve their rewards for the hard work they have put in.\u201d",
