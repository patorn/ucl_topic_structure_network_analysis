  "body": "The Turkish president has asked Europe to welcome more of the 3 million refugees currently living in Turkey, as the main group campaigning to take Britain out of the EU suggested that higher levels of immigration from Turkey could pose a security risk if the country is admitted to the EU.    Related: When the world failed Syria, Turkey stepped in. Now others must help | Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan    Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Sunday that Europe was not doing enough to shoulder the refugee burden in Turkey, which now holds more refugees than any other country in the world, after the Syrian civil war forced 2.7 million Syrians to flee northwards across the Turkish border. The president made his comments as he confirmed Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m as the new prime minister, following the ousting of his predecessot Ahmet Davuto\u011flu earlier in the month for allegedly blocking Erdo\u011fan\u2019s path to power. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, a long-time ally, vowed to give greater authority to the president\u2019s office while eroding the powers of the prime minister. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s remarks on migration may unknowingly fan the flames of an ongoing debate in Britain, where one of the campaigns calling for Brexit claimed the UK faced a huge influx of Turkish immigrants if Britain continued its membership of the union and Turkey was allowed to join it.  Writing in the Guardian, Erdo\u011fan drew British readers\u2019 attention to a different kind of migration flow from Turkey \u2013 that of Syrian refugees. Turkey expects western countries such as Britain to step up the formal resettlement of Syrians on Turkish soil, particularly after Turkey agreed in March to readmit all asylum seekers arriving by sea to Greek shores.    Related: \u2018Why are they making us out to be such a threat?\u2019: Turks react to Vote Leave    \u201cAs the Syrian civil war enters its sixth year, we are calling on the world to rise to the challenge and create a fair mechanism for sharing the burden,\u201d Erdo\u011fan wrote. \u201cTo keep illegal immigration under control, Europe and Turkey must work together to create legal mechanisms, such as the March 2016 agreement, for the resettlement of Syrian refugees. By rewarding refugees who play by the rules and making it clear that illegal immigrants will be sent back to Turkey, we can persuade refugees to avoid risking their lives at sea.\u201d Erdo\u011fan\u2019s office would not be drawn into how many Syrians he hopes the west will welcome. But a Turkish diplomat separately told the Guardian last week that Turkey was hoping for as many as half a million people.     Refugees at a camp in Osmaniye, Turkey. Photograph: Umit Bektas/Reuters    Speaking at a migration conference in Istanbul, Esen Altu\u011f, Turkey\u2019s deputy director for migration, asylum and visas, said: \u201cThere are 3 million [Syrian and Iraqi refugees] already now in Turkey. Until now, 2,000 have been taken by the Canadians. But unfortunately, from European countries, the number is very, very low. So we want something like 500,000 [resettled to Europe]. As a voluntary programme, of course \u2013 these Syrians families should want to go to Europe.\u201d Erdo\u011fan\u2019s call came days after the EU revealed that just 177 Syrians have been resettled from Turkey to Europe since the start of the EU-Turkey deal in March. His comments were also pointedly made on the eve of the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, a highly anticipated UN event in which politicians from 175 countries and campaigners from thousands of aid groups will gather in the nominal hope of reforming the aid system.  With more people \u2013 approximately 130 million \u2013 in need of humanitarian aid than ever, aid groups increasingly under-resourced and international law under growing threat, the UN wants the international community to agree to new global humanitarian standards.    Related: Everything you need to know about the world humanitarian summit    As the conference\u2019s host, Erdo\u011fan has been keen to associate himself with its goals. \u201cThe world humanitarian summit will convene to address these pressing problems, seek to fix the humanitarian system\u2019s glitches and make a long-term commitment to develop new capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the first time, heads of state and government, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and those affected by humanitarian crises will come together to look for answers.\u201d But critics of the conference fear that little will actually be achieved, with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res calling it a \u201cfig-leaf\u201d for international failures, and Oxfam describing it as an \u201cexpensive talking shop\u201d. Some view Turkey\u2019s own role as exemplary of the conference\u2019s flaws. Turkey is playing host while cracking down on opposition media, while critics also argue that Turkey\u2019s treatment of refugees is not as generous as Turkish politicians imply. MSF has even pulled out of the conference, saying it no longer believes that the assembled leaders have any genuine desire to make any binding commitments. Vickie Hawkins MSF\u2019s UK director, said it was unlikely that the same countries who are currently shirking their obligations to refugees would turn over a new leaf next week.   Related: The Guardian view on renewed tensions between the EU and Turkey: tough times ahead | Editorial     \u201cThe contradiction became too much for us,\u201d said Hawkins. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any confidence that anything different will come out of the conference. There\u2019s a lot of good intentions, but also empty rhetoric. And we felt we needed more than that, given the current disregard for international law.\u201d Equality Now, a womens\u2019 rights group, questioned how leaders could be trusted to commit to new pledges given that it still had not met its previous promises to women. \u201cNew commitments by governments are positive steps, but only if change actually takes place afterwards,\u201d said Brendan Wynne, spokesman for Equality Now. \u201cWe are still waiting for countless commitments made at the Beijing conference in 1995 and elsewhere to be followed through on.\u201d But Canada\u2019s international development minister, Marie-Claude Bibeau, believed the conference had already been a good catalyst for change. \u201cThe important thing is not what is going to happen during these couple of days,\u201d said Bibeau. \u201cIt\u2019s really all the work that has been done before to get here, and all the work that will be done after to fulfil our commitments.\u201d Bibeau, whose government has welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees, also echoed Erdo\u011fan\u2019s call for greater sharing of Turkey\u2019s refugee burden. \u201cWe all have to do our fair share.\u201d",
