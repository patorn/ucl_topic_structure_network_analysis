This weekend, nearly half the population of Austria voted for a far-right candidate. If it wasn\u2019t for the votes of 31,000 Austrians \u2013 out of a 4.64 million-strong electorate \u2013 the country\u2019s figurehead would now be Norbert Hofer, a man who wears the blue cornflower, a symbol associated with the Nazis. And here\u2019s a statistic that should terrify anyone who leans to the left: nearly nine out of 10 Austrian manual workers plumped for the far right. Austria is no blip. Not since 1945 have movements of the far right and xenophobic right had such support across the continent. In France, the Front National  \u2013 a far-right party which has exploited the crisis of French socialism by stealing the left\u2019s economic rhetoric \u2013 won the most votes in the first round of regional elections last December. In Germany, polls show the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany creeping up on the beleaguered Social Democrats. Hungary is ruled by an authoritarian rightwing government, and polls show around a fifth of Hungarians support the far right, antisemitic Jobbik party. From Poland to Italy, from Switzerland to Greece, from Sweden to the Netherlands, the radical right is flourishing. It\u2019s not a phenomenon confined to Europe, of course: across the Atlantic, a racist, Muslim-hating \u201calternative right\u201d is mobilising behind Donald Trump\u2019s presidential bid.   Related: For Austria\u2019s far right, defeat may be a springboard | Jeremy Cliffe    Undoubtedly, this is a story of economic grievances \u2013 magnified by the 2008 financial crash \u2013 colliding with anti-immigrant sentiment. But it\u2019s also a by-product of the crisis of social democracy. In postwar Europe, social democracy gave working people political representation and used the power of the state to mitigate the excesses of capitalism. But its traditional base \u2013 an industrial working class and progressive middle-class people \u2013 has evolved and fragmented. Free-market globalisation has challenged the power of the state. The end of the cold war was spun as the death of any alternative to untrammelled markets, leaving social democrats to embrace free-market dogmas. And \u2013 in the aftermath of the financial crisis \u2013 European social democracy either supported or implemented widespread cuts, abandoning the most basic social democratic concept of all, public investment. Social democracy has collapsed as a coherent political force in Europe. The far right isn\u2019t the only beneficiary of the collapse of social democracy, of course. New movements of the left \u2013 from Spain\u2019s Podemos to Greece\u2019s Syriza to the Corbyn phenomenon to the Sanders surge \u2013 have benefited, too. In Austria, it wasn\u2019t the social democrats who beat the far right: it was a more radical independent Green candidate. The frustrations, insecurities and fears that are fuelling the radical right and the new left aren\u2019t going to go away: they are set to increase. If the new left doesn\u2019t succeed, then Europe\u2019s future will be shaped by the far right. The response to Austria\u2019s knife-edge result shouldn\u2019t be relief \u2013 it must be a violent wake-up call.",
