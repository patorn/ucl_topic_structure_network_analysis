  "body": "Ryan on Scott What were you hoping for?For an interesting evening and maybe someone who was OK to have a few drinks with. First impressions?Lovely smile, not nervous. What did you talk about?Eighties pop and folk music, his vegetarianism, my love of roast chicken. Any awkward moments?No. Good table manners?All fine. We shared the starters. Best thing about Scott?He made me feel comfortable and was easy to talk to. Would you introduce him to your friends? Easily. He\u2019s a lovely guy. Describe Scott in three wordsWarm, cute, intelligent. What do you think he made of you?It was very pleasant. I think he liked me, but we\u2019ll see. Did you go on somewhere?We stayed for another bottle. And\u2026 did you kiss?A peck on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?He didn\u2019t like his bourbon cocktail. (Negroni all the way!) Marks out of 10?A solid 8. Would you meet again?I think so. I\u2019m not sure about sparks and butterflies, but he\u2019s a lovely guy. Scott on Ryan What were you hoping for?No real expectations (though Chris Pratt did come to mind). First impressions?What a lovely smile. What did you talk about?Our professions, our countries of birth, his very intriguing upbringing, his dedication to his allotments \u2013 I\u2019m actually considering one now. Any awkward moments?I think he looked disappointed initially, though that may have just been nerves. Good table manners?Completely, and attentive with filling wine glasses. Best thing about Ryan?That he was completely positive the whole evening. Would you introduce him to your friends? Without hesitation. Describe Ryan in three wordsHandsome, engaging, enlightened. What do you think he made of you?The conversation never felt awkward, so I can only assume he enjoyed the evening. Did you go on somewhere?No, it was going on 11pm and we had work in the morning.   Related: Blind date: \u2018I could have gone easier on the booze\u2019    And\u2026 did you kiss?A quick peck on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I\u2019d probably go for a different restaurant due to the lack of veggie options. Marks out of 10?7.5. Would you meet again?He\u2019s a lovely guy, but I think we\u2019re heading down the friends route here. \u2022 Scott and Ryan ate at Bukowski Grill Soho, London W1. Fancy a blind date?
