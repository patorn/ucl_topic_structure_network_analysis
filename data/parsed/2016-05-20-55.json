  "body": "When is a distinguished writer not a distinguished writer? When he\u2019s a celebrity. I rather feel that John le Carr\u00e9 has earned his right to let it be known that he would prefer Britain to stay in the EU. He\u2019s no stranger to internecine international politics, after all. Yet suddenly Le Carr\u00e9 is just one among nearly 300 \u201cluvvies\u201d who have signed a letter, published in the Telegraph, arguing that EU membership is good for the arts.   Related: Benedict Cumberbatch and Paloma Faith among 250 stars backing EU    Le Carr\u00e9 is by no means the only signatory who lists gently towards the intellectual heavyweight end of the cultural spectrum. Ian McEwan\u2019s there. So\u2019s Carol Ann Duffy. Yet that hasn\u2019t stopped the letter from the jeers of condemnation. Because somehow it\u2019s an outrage if the effete denizens of \u201cthe arts\u201d don\u2019t accept that success in literature, fashion design or architecture renders them exileys from the horny-handed, back-breaking toil of democracy. Actual luvvies have signed the letter as well. By which, of course, I mean posh theatrical types. It\u2019s easy to see where they\u2019re coming from. Without Europe, after all, would the UK ever have caught on to the both-cheeks, mwah-mwah, air kiss? I very much doubt it. I don\u2019t want to live in a world where Jude Law greets Jenny Agutter with a firm handshake, or Keira Knightley and John Hurt exchange gruff nods. I don\u2019t actually want to live in a world where we sneer at these guys even as we enjoy their talents. But God, why do they make it so easy to do?     \u2018I doubt that Tracey Emin hopes the population will join her in lobbying for legislation to tighten the health and safety aspects of bed making.\u2019 Photograph: Lauren Hurley/PA    It\u2019s hard not to notice, as you stare at\u00a0a neat panel of photographs of already achingly familiar faces, that a lot of these \u201cluvvies\u201d are indeed posh. Perusing the Guardian\u2019s own neat panel, I did a quick background audit. Sam Taylor-Johnson had free school meals, I told myself. Paloma Faith grew up in pre-gentrification Hackney. Danny Boyle had Irish parents, when having Irish parents was like having a tattoo on your forehead saying: \u201cI\u2019m an IRA potato.\u201d The other three \u2013 Benedict Cumberbatch, Helena Bonham Carter and Dominic West \u2013 are, however, as posh as anything. They\u2019re people who have never had to worry too much about where the next meal\u2019s coming from, or how to put a roof over their heads. Privileged people dominate in the arts again now, after a mid-20th century blooming of working-class talent, precisely because it\u2019s so hard to invest time and energy in your future, rather than your here and now, when you don\u2019t have the Bank of Mum and Dad to back you. So who are these guys to tell the people who have to worry about the here and now what to think, how to vote, or indeed simply to remind the nation that their own elite passions and preoccupations are also an important aspect of national life? Which they are. Well, they\u2019re the guys whose names persuade people to watch TV shows, go to movies, buy perfume, become aware of a certain brand of jeans or stand in the rain waiting for an actual sighting, maybe an actual wave.    What\u2019s more arrogant than deciding that making your opinions public isn\u2019t worth the hassle you\u2019re going to get?    Whether we like it or not, whether they like it or not, they are people who have persuasive superpowers. Of course they\u2019re bound sometimes to find themselves thinking: \u201cHow can I use my persuasive superpowers to Do Good?\u201d The answers \u2013 charity work, awareness raising, speaking out \u2013 are well rehearsed. I doubt that Matthew Bourne believes people will vote the way he suggests because they loved his Swan Lake; that Michael Frayn hopes to galvanise fans of A Very Private Life; or that Tracey Emin hopes the population will join her in lobbying for legislation to tighten the health and safety aspects of bed-making. They all just received the letter in their inbox, and realised, among other things, that it would be more self-important to refuse to sign than to sign. What\u2019s more arrogant than placing yourself \u201cabove\u201d politics? What\u2019s more arrogant than deciding that making your heartfelt opinions public simply isn\u2019t worth the hassle you\u2019re going to get for doing so? The royal family is obliged to place itself above politics. For everyone else, it\u2019s either a highly self-indulgent luxury or a hopeless admission of how little you feel you and your views matter. Neither ardent self-love nor abject self-loathing is enviable.   Related: The luvvies\u2019 Brexit letter only shows most people vote with their wallets | Simon Jenkins    Brexiters don\u2019t fulminate about the beautiful people opposing them en modest masse because their intervention is trivial and silly; they insist that it\u2019s trivial and silly because they wish it were. People who see the letters EU and read them as \u201cPrepare to be bored out of your mind\u201d (and I\u2019m afraid I count myself in that number more certainly with every day that passes)may well see \u201cNitin Sawhney\u201d and think, \u201c23 June. I suppose I\u2019d better make the effort to turn up and vote in.\u201d Likewise, people who might not previously have quite mustered the enthusiasm to commit to voting out might find Kelly Hoppen\u2019s advice exactly the thing they needed to kick hard against. Which is fair enough. Putting your name to a letter because it\u2019s a mildly novel way of keeping something important in the headlines, even though you know it will irritate some people and inspire others to slag you off, in exactly the way they always do, is actually the act of a pretty decent sort, someone who actually doesn\u2019t always take themselves too seriously at all. Luvvies. I love \u2019em. Mwah-mwah.",
