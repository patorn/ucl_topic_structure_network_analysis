The news comes as one important atmospheric measuring station at Cape Grim in Australia is poised on the verge of 400ppm for the first time. Sitting in a region with stable CO2 concentrations, once that happens, it will never get a reading below 400ppm.

When enough CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, the seasonal cycles that drive the concentrations up and down throughout the year will eventually stop dipping the concentration below the 400ppm mark. The 400ppm figure is just symbolic, but it\u2019s psychologically powerful, says Butler.     In Hawaii, the Mauna Loa station is sitting above 400 ppm and might never dip below it again.

But the northern hemisphere has a large seasonal cycle, where CO2 concentrations decrease in summer but increase in winter. So each year since it has dipped back below 400ppm. Then, combining all the global readings, the global monthly average was found to pass 400ppm in March 2015.

This week scientists revealed to Fairfax Media that Cape Grim had a reading of 399.9ppm on 6 May. Within weeks it would pop above 400ppm and never return. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have expected to reach the 400ppm mark so early,\u201d said David Etheridge, an atmospheric scientist from the CSIRO, which runs the Cape Grim station. \u201cWith El Nino, the ocean essentially caps off it\u2019s ability to take up heat so the concentrations are growing fast as warmer land areas release carbon. So we would have otherwise expected it to happen later in the year. \u201cNo matter what the world\u2019s emissions are now, we can decrease growth but we can\u2019t decrease the concentration. \u201cEven if we stopped emitting now, we\u2019re committed to a lot of warming.\u201d Over in Hawaii, the Mauna Loa station, which is the longest-running in the world, is sitting above 400 ppm, and for the first time, might never dip below it again. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d Butler told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s getting real close.\u201d Meanwhile, the global average, after controlling for the seasonal cycle, popped above 400ppm late last year. Within a couple of years, the seasonal dips will never drop below 400ppm in the global average too.     Air samples collected at Cape Grim, Tasmania, Australia, under clean air (baseline) conditions.

Butler also emphasised that this CO2 is locking in future warming. \u201cIt\u2019s like lying in bed with your electric blanket set to three. You jack it up to seven \u2013 you don\u2019t get hot right away but you do get hot. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d The CO2 concentrations are driving what appears to be runaway climate change around the world. This year has seen record hot global ocean temperatures, which have caused coral reefs all around the world to bleach and devastated Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef. Air surface temperatures have also been shocking climate scientists. Yearly and monthly temperature records have been breaking regularly, with many of the records being broken by the biggest margins ever seen. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ugly when you look at it,\u201d Butler said.
