  "body": "A \u201cvery scarce\u201d signed novel by A Clockwork Orange\u2019s author Anthony Burgess, which was pulped following libel action \u2013 from a school secretary who recognised herself in the book \u2013 is set to be sold at one of the world\u2019s largest gatherings of antiquarian booksellers later this month. Burgess\u2019s The Worm and the Ring was published in 1961 by Heinemann, but was pulled from circulation after Gwendoline Bustin, who was the secretary of Banbury Grammar School and later mayor of Banbury, brought a libel action against it. Burgess had taught at the school in the early 1950s, and Bustin was not the only recognisable character in the book, but she was the only one to sue.     The signed copy of The Worm and the Ring by Anthony Burgess. Photograph: Ashton Rare Books    Heinemann ended up pulping its unsold copies of the book, according to Les Ashton of Ashton Rare Books, who will be selling a 1961 first edition of the book, signed by the author, at the London international antiquarian book fair this month. Heinemann republished The Worm and the Ring in a revised edition in 1970\u00ad, but Ashton said it was \u201cvery scarce\u201d to find a copy of the unrevised edition for sale, and \u201cultra rare\u201d to find a signed copy. \u201cBurgess just based it on his time at the school, and people clearly recognised themselves, but she [Bustin] complained to the publishers and Heinemann got scared off. She must have been a bit of a forceful character,\u201d said Ashton. Roger Lewis\u2019s biography of Burgess reveals that the lines complained of in the libel writ describe the secretary, Alice in the book, as an \u201cincubus\u201d who is \u201ca bit deranged \u2026 the sort of woman who should have got married ages ago\u201d. She\u2019s \u201cjust pitiable\u201d, she \u201cseemed to be suppressing an old maid\u2019s excitement\u201d, and \u201cseems definitely unbalanced, the sort who might shout out dirty words under an anaesthetic\u201d. \u201cThough Burgess made the pathetic excuse that it was a complete coincidence if his school secretary bore any resemblance to the actual school secretary, everybody in Banbury at once saw the accuracy of the portrait \u2013 and Gwen Bustin rather proved that she was indeed a hysterical dried-up old duenna by reacting in the way she did \u2013 ie by hiring Colin Duncan QC to express her outrage in open court that she\u2019d been portrayed in a book as a hysterical dried-up old duenna,\u201d writes Lewis. \u201cOne can only feel sorry for her.\u201d Ashton, one of more than 180 antiquarian book dealers at the London fair between 26 and 28 May, has priced the book at \u00a32,750. It will be jostling for place with a host of rare titles. The fair this year takes as its theme The Birth of the Gothic, and dealers are bringing first editions of titles from Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein to Victor Hugo\u2019s The Hunchback of Notre Dame.     One of a collection of Jane Austen editions owned by her close friend, Martha Lloyd. Photograph: Jonathan Frost    There will also be a copy of Jane Austen\u2019s gothic parody Northanger Abbey, which its seller is promising will allow \u201ca tantalisingly close brush with one of this country\u2019s greatest novelists\u201d. The novel, along with copies of Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, is signed by Austen\u2019s close friend Martha Lloyd, the woman to whom Austen dedicated her early work Frederic and Elfrida, and with whom she lived for a period. Lloyd was a collector of recipes and a writer, and went on to marry Austen\u2019s brother Frank. \u201cThey were very close from an early age,\u201d said Jonathan Frost of J&M Books. \u201cThese books give that electric feeling\u2013 they were in the room, in the house, with Jane Austen. It\u2019s just conjecture, but we know their connection, and it\u2019s just one magic step to the fact that Austen handled them, and looked at them. It\u2019s quite extraordinary.\u201d The signed Pride and Prejudice is being sold for \u00a320,000, Sense and Sensibility for \u00a328,000 and Northanger Abbey for \u00a319,500. \u201cThey come directly from the Austen family and this is the first time they\u2019ve been up for sale,\u201d said Frost, who speculated that Lloyd would have written her name into the books when moving house. \u201cThese days, it\u2019s expected that authors will inscribe their books, but that\u2019s a fairly modern phenomenon. It would have been fairly peculiar if Jane Austen had written her name in these, but if she had inscribed them, I would have added another zero to the price,\u201d said Frost. According to J&M Books, \u201cvery few books inscribed by Austen exist and tend to command vast sums when they appear\u201d.",
