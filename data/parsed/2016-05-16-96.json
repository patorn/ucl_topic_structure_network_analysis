  "body": "Mercedes should fine an \u201cemotional\u201d Lewis Hamilton for causing the first-lap accident that put him and his team-mate Nico Rosberg out of last weekend\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix, according to the three-times world champion Sir Jackie Stewart.   Related: Nico Rosberg ponders clear-the-air talks with Lewis Hamilton after crash    As Rosberg was contemplating holding talks with Hamilton, Stewart backed the German. \u201cIt was all emotion,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cFirst lap! Desperation. That\u2019s not the way to win, not consistently. Hamilton is to blame. Rosberg was allowed to protect himself. You don\u2019t go for it on the first lap. \u201cTwo cars from the same team can\u2019t possibly have an accident on the first lap. One of the major assets for all of the great drivers has been mind management. Don\u2019t get wound up and excited. I think Lewis could have won this race but it didn\u2019t have to be on the first lap. The accident was almost ready to take place.\u201d The crash happened after both cars had cleared turn 3. Hamilton moved to take the slower Mercedes on the inside but as he did so Rosberg moved across to block him. Hamilton went on to the grass and as he spun he took out Rosberg, making way for Max Verstappen to win Sunday\u2019s race on the 18-year-old\u2019s Red Bull debut. Both Mercedes drivers had shown aggression and the decision by the stewards to dismiss it as a racing incident and not penalise either driver seemed a fair one. Mercedes also backed away from blaming either Hamilton or Rosberg. Yet Stewart was fierce in his condemnation of Hamilton. \u201cIt was a tremendous faux pas for Mercedes-Benz to take both cars out. They are so much better than any other team. It\u2019s just completely wrong \u2013 and then for Hamilton to throw the steering wheel out of the car. Probably $40,000-$50,000 of steering wheel. Emotion is a very dangerous thing. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable. Lots of people make mistakes. What you\u2019ve got to do is come out of the mistake but you\u2019ve got to admit it and think about why would you have done such a thing on the first lap, when you\u2019re so much quicker than everyone else. I don\u2019t think Lewis understood that. I don\u2019t think that Rosberg did anything wrong. \u201cI think there\u2019s a need for discipline \u2013 maybe financial. I would certainly have penalised the driver who made that mistake on the first lap. It would have to be financial. At the moment Lewis is making such a lot of money that it might not be a big penalty.\u201d Alain Prost had another viewpoint. \u201cThis is only the first time in three years they have taken each other out,\u201d the four-time world champion said. \u201cWe have to be careful we don\u2019t overreact.\u201d Jacques Villeneuve, the 1997 champion, blamed Rosberg for the accident, describing his move to block Hamilton as \u201cruthless.\u201d   Related: F1 Spanish Grand Prix: five things we learned from Barcelona    Rosberg, when asked about having talks with Hamilton before the next race in Monaco on 29 May, said: \u201cThat is something I need to think about in the days to come. I can\u2019t tell you now as I am extremely gutted. \u201cIt is very tough because it was my race to win. I am not just gutted for myself but I am gutted for everybody because we are one team and we are together in this. \u201cI know how much they work for these two cars and for us both to end up in the gravel trap is the worst possible thing.\u201d Mercedes could insist their drivers get together for a meeting but there is not much to be gained because both drivers saw the incident differently and are not about to change their minds.",
