  "body": "Labor has maintained a 52-48, two-party preferred lead in the latest Essential poll, and also received majority support for its carbon policy.   Related: Labor proposes two emissions trading schemes costing $355.9m    Respondents were told: \u201cThe Labor party recently announced their policy to tackle climate change which includes a target of reducing Australia\u2019s carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 (compared to the Coalition government\u2019s target of 26-28%) and introducing an emissions trading scheme\u201d. When the policy was described in this way, 57% of respondents were in favour and just 21% opposed. The 52-48, two-party-preferred figure is the same as the last Essential poll released on Wednesday. But the poll suggests voters prefer the Coalition\u2019s policy on negative gearing, with 43% favouring negative gearing and 36% against. Voters polled were narrowly opposed to Labor\u2019s policy to limit negative gearing in future to tax deductions for investments on newly-built homes, with 36% in favour and 38% opposed.  Essential noted that the results of both negative gearing questions were much the same as when the question was asked in March.   Related: How negative gearing replaced the great Australian dream and distorted the economy | Greg Jericho    Asked what they thought the effect of limiting negative gearing would be, most said house prices would grow more slowly (31%), followed by those who thought they would fall (24%). The rest were unsure (31%) or thought prices would grow at the same rate (13%). Malcolm Turnbull was more likely to be described as a capable leader than Bill Shorten (by a difference of 18%), judged more intelligent (by 17%) and better in a crisis (by 15%).  Shorten was more likely to be described as erratic (by 3%) and aggressive (by 5%). But Shorten has made gains, with more voters describing him as a capable leader (up 7%), intelligent (up 4%) and understanding of Australians\u2019 problems (up 3%). Turnbull\u2019s numbers have increased for narrow-minded (up 8%), intolerant (up 8%) and erratic (up 7%). On 5 April, Labor pulled ahead of the Coalition for the first time since Tony Abbott was replaced as prime minister with a 51-49% result in Newspoll.",
