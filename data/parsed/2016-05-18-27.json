  "body": "Labour has accused Nigel Farage of showing \u201cshades of Enoch Powell\u201d, after he warned it was possible there could be violence on the streets if immigration continued at high levels. The Ukip leader was criticised by Chuka Umunna, the former shadow business secretary, and Doreen Lawrence, the Labour peer and mother of murdered teenager Stephen, after he said a vote to remain in the EU could lead to conflict. \u201cI think it\u2019s legitimate to say that if people feel they have lost control completely \u2013 and we have lost control of our borders completely as members of the European Union \u2013 and if people feel that voting doesn\u2019t change anything, then violence is the next step,\u201d Farage told the BBC on Wednesday. \u201cI find it difficult to contemplate it happening here, but nothing is impossible.\u201d It came the day after Farage had a furious row with Peter Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, when the Ukip leader claimed Tony Blair\u2019s government had wanted deliberately to \u201crub our noses in diversity\u201d.      Chuka Umunna said the Ukip leader was \u2018showing his true colours\u2019. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA    Umunna said Farage was \u201cletting his true colours show with shades of Enoch Powell in his latest outburst\u201d.  \u201cHe is losing the argument and paving the way for defeat but it is the height of irresponsibility to suggest there will be violence on the streets if he doesn\u2019t get his own narrow-minded way,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnyone who experienced the London riots will be disgusted to hear that Nigel Farage thinks violence is the \u2018next step\u2019 if he cannot win the argument.\u201d Lawrence added that the comments were \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d. \u201cAt a time when the public want facts and measured debate to inform their decision on the EU referendum, he is focused on rubbishing attempts to increase diversity and suggesting there may be violence on the streets if the public don\u2019t vote his way,\u201d she said.  \u201cWhen only 6% of MPs and peers are from ethnic minority backgrounds and almost 70% of boards of FTSE 100 companies are exclusively white, it is simply wrong to say people are \u2018having their noses\u2019 rubbed in diversity... And he should not speak lightly about seeing violence on our streets in the event of a vote to remain in the EU.\u201d     Umunna compared Farage to Enoch Powell, who was sacked from the Conservative front bench for his infamous \u2018rivers of blood\u2019 speech. Photograph: Colin Davey/Getty Images    Umunna was referring to Powell\u2019s warning that mass immigration can make people feel like strangers in their own country from the then Conservative shadow minister\u2019s 1968 \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech. However, the accusation is unlikely to wound Farage given he has previously backed the \u201cbasic principle\u201d of that speech and named Powell as his political hero in a 2008 interview with Total Politics magazine, although he said he was not thinking of the controversial speech that got the Tory politician sacked from Ted Heath\u2019s shadow frontbench team. \u201cI would never say that Powell was racist in any way at all,\u201d Farage said at the time. \u201cHad we listened to him, we would have much better race relations now than we have got.\u201d The EU debate turned to immigration on Wednesday as statistics showed the number of EU migrants working in Britain has risen by 224,000 to a record 2.15 million over the past year. However, the remain campaign sought to concentrate on the economy as Alistair Darling, the Labour former chancellor, warned that a vote to leave the EU could plunge the UK economy back into recession. He pointed to warnings from the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England, and claimed that \u201crecent experience and historic evidence\u201d suggests there is a real chance leaving the EU could cause a new downturn.And he said that such an event would be \u201cdisastrous for working peoples\u2019 life chances and living standards\u201d. Vote Leave, the official out campaign, also made a new economic argument, as Priti Patel, the employment minister, warned curry restaurants were being starved of chefs by an immigration policy that caps the number of skilled workers from outside the EU.",
