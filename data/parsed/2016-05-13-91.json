  "body": "I gave evidence at the Hillsborough inquests, where I met your reporter David Conn, and I have since followed his reports. Can I say thank you for publishing the truth and continuing to publish detailed stories of the day? Despite this month\u2019s inquest verdict, some people are still blaming us, so it\u2019s really important to me and other survivors that more and more facts come into the public domain. One thing that is not published much is the survivors\u2019 story. I don\u2019t mean about the day itself but about the battle we have had to clear our names. I have lost count of the times I have been told \u201cYou killed your own\u201d or overheard people in my local pub saying \u201cIt was their fault\u201d or \u201cI know someone who lived near the ground \u2013 they were all drunk and fighting\u201d. The impact on the lives of the survivors has been huge. For 27 years we have had to live with being branded and made to feel guilty. We feel we have to justify everything we say and still have to continue our fight to educate people. The damage the Sun newspaper did was immense: its lies have now been passed down generations. I wonder how many more years will pass until we don\u2019t hear them any more? While all the focus is on the 96, and rightly so, many survivors couldn\u2019t cope with what happened on that day and in the years after. Many have taken their own lives. Once again thank you for continuing to uncover the truth. It really does mean a lot to many survivors and it helps in the healing process.Ian JohnsonSheffield \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
