  "body": "The narrow defeat \u2013 by just 0.6 percentage points \u2013 of the nationalist Freedom party\u2019s Norbert Hofer in this week\u2019s Austrian presidential elections has focused attention once more on the rise of far-right parties in Europe. But despite what some headlines might claim, it is oversimplifying things to say the far right is suddenly on the march across an entire continent. In some countries, the hard right\u2019s share of the vote in national elections has been stable or declined.  In others \u2013 particularly the nations of southern Europe, which, with memories of fascism and dictatorship still very much alive, have proved reluctant to flirt with rightwing extremism \u2013 it is the far left that is advancing. Some rightwing populist parties are relatively new, but others have been a force to be reckoned with for many years now, sometimes \u2013 as in France \u2013 enjoying a large share of the vote but being unable, as yet, to break through nationally.  The concerns of many may be broadly the same: immigration, integration, jobs, incomes, the EU, political and business elites. The euro crisis, followed by Europe\u2019s migrant crisis and the Paris and Brussels terror attacks have fuelled their rise.  But their ideological roots are very different: from anti-establishment to neo-fascist, nationalist to anti-austerity, authoritarian to populist, libertarian to Catholic ultra-conservative. Germany\u2019s AfD is not Hungary\u2019s Fidesz. The Finns and the Danish People\u2019s party loathe France\u2019s Front National, and the Netherlands\u2019 PVV is nothing like Poland\u2019s Law and Justice, which bears no resemblance to Austria\u2019s Freedom party. It may be misleading to bracket them all together in the same category.  What is undeniably happening, however, is that the continent\u2019s traditional mainstream parties are in full retreat. Across Europe, the centre-left social democrats and centre-right Christian democrats who have dominated national politics for 60 years are in decline.  Following a collapse in support for its two centrist parties last December, Spain has been unable to form a government and will hold fresh elections next month. The three mainstream parties in the Netherlands are set to win 40% of the vote between them in elections next year \u2013 roughly what any one of them might have got previously. Even in Germany, it seems highly likely that support for liberal and green parties and, above all, the populist, anti-immigrant AfD, could soon bring to an end an era of two-party political stability that has endured since the end of the second world war. What is on the march across Europe may not be the far right, but distrust, disillusion, even full-scale rejection of the political establishment: in the first round of Austria\u2019s presidential elections, the centre-right and centre-left parties barely polled 10% each.

Meanwhile, comedian Beppe Grillo\u2019s anti-establishment, anti-corruption and anti-euro Five Star Movement has entered with a flourish, winning 25% of the national vote in 2015.

Photograph: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images    In national elections, support for Marine Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigrant, anti-euro Front National has swung between 11% in 2002 to 4% in 2007 and nearly 14% in 2012. In recent European (24%) and regional (27%) elections it has done far better, but France\u2019s two-round electoral system means it has yet to make a decisive breakthrough. Le Pen is thought likely to reach the run-off in next year\u2019s presidential elections but, like her father in 2002, be defeated.

Photograph: Scanpix Sweden/Reuters    National support for the nationalist, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats has rocketed since 2006 and the party won 49 seats in the 2014 elections, giving it the balance of power in parliament. The refugee crisis has further increased its following, although its support has fallen since January polls suggested it might be Sweden\u2019s biggest party. For the time being, other parliamentary groups refuse to cooperate with it.   Sweden   Denmark     Danish People\u2019s party leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl. Photograph: Scanpix Denmark/Reuters    Support for the anti-immigration, \u201cmore Denmark, less EU\u201d Danish People\u2019s party, which has 37 seats in parliament and is propping up a minority Liberal government, is helping to force a significant hardening of Denmark\u2019s asylum and refugee policies. Its support has surged in the past five years, rising from 14% to 21% in last year\u2019s general elections.    Denmark   Finland     Timo Soini, chairman of the Finns party.

Support has grown rapidly and it now has 38 seats in the Finnish parliament.   Finland   Spain     Leader of Spain\u2019s leftwing Podemos, Pablo Iglesias. Photograph: Curto de la Torre/AFP/Getty Images    The new leftwing, anti-establishment and anti-austerity Podemos, born from the Indignados protests during the financial crisis, and the more right-leaning, anti-corruption Citizens party, born in 2006 as a regional party to counter Catalan separatism, both made a spectacular entry on to the national political scene last year, collecting 35% of the vote between them and stymying the mainstream parties\u2019 hopes of forming a government.

Currently polling at around 15%, five points behind the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the party has focused increasingly on opposing immigration and recently adopted a motion saying Islam was not compatible with the German constitution.

Electoral support for the Syriza movement \u2013 a coalition of radical left parties that came to power on a promise to fight EU austerity \u2013 has grown more than sevenfold to more than 35%.

Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty    Support for the rightwing Law and Justice party, standing for Catholic conservative morality and greater state intervention, has grown steadily since 2005, allowing it to win last year\u2019s elections. Its subsequent reinterpretation of democracy has brought it into increasing conflict with the EU and many of its own citizens.

Photograph: Balazs Mohai/EPA    Jobbik, Hungary\u2019s third-strongest party, denies it is racist, but its ideology is so freighted with antisemitism, racism and homophobia that most far-right parties shun it. Its rapid growth, from 2% to 21% of the vote since 2006, has spurred the ruling national conservative Fidesz party to increasingly hardline policies \u2013 including the erection of a razorwire fence last year to exclude refugees.   Hungary   Belgium     Gerolf Annemans of Vlaams Belang. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters    Support for Vlaams Belang, the far-right, nationalist and populist Flemish-language party, has plummeted from 12% to 4% in national elections since 2007, although recent polls suggest it is rallying successfully under a new leader and may be approaching its former levels.

Recent polls, however, suggest that unless its flamboyant founder runs into another scandal, it may end up as the Netherlands\u2019 largest party in elections next year, with up to 25% of the vote.
