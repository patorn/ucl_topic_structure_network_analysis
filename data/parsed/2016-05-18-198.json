  "body": "The former mayor of London\u2019s response to claims he buried a report on how toxic air disproportionately affects deprived schools was trademark Boris Johnson bluster. To allege there was a cover-up was \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201crisible\u201d, he said. Of course he hadn\u2019t hid the impact of dirty air. But in defending his record on air pollution, he also seemed to make things worse. On Monday we didn\u2019t know if Johnson himself was personally aware of the findings of the unpublished report that the new mayor Sadiq Khan accuses him of suppressing.  There was no denial from Johnson that the report (which was completed in September 2013) had not been published but perhaps it had never been brought to his attention. It is hard to actively suppress a report if you don\u2019t even know about it. Now we know he did know about it - or at least some of its key findings. On Tuesday, Johnson said there could be no cover-up because he had already made a speech in 2015 about pollution in deprived schools. \u201cI made the very point about primary schools and poor air quality in areas of deprivation. So as cover-ups go it wasn\u2019t a particularly brilliant one, considering I made a speech about it,\u201d he told reporters during a visit to an aluminium plant. In that speech, a lecture to a small crowd at the Sir Simon Milton lecture in June last year, the then-mayor said: \u201cI can tell you that for London primary schools that have the misfortune to be in areas of poor air quality, 82%, 82% of those London primary schools affected by poor air quality are in areas of economic deprivation.\u201d            Set aside the fact that the actual figure is 83% or the fact that it was the schools that were considered deprived rather than the areas. What\u2019s interesting about this is it tells us Johnson had read the report, or had at least been briefed on its conclusions - and was talking about it nearly two years after it was handed over to City Hall by the authors. But neither he, his office or the former deputy mayor for environment and energy, Matthew Pencharz, can explain why it wasn\u2019t published. Johnson thought its key finding was striking enough to mention in a speech, and yet the full report was not made public. Pencharz tweeted in response to people outraged at the apparent cover-up that if they listened to Johnson\u2019s response on Tuesday, they\u2019d know \u201cwe were aware of [the] problem & [there was] no cover-up.\u201d But there was no explanation of why the report was not published. There\u2019s also the question of the delay. If Johnson was so passionate about reducing the brutal inequality of air pollution why did he wait until June 2015 to mention the key finding in a report produced in September 2013? Even the author of the report, the director of the Oxford-based environmental consultancy Aether, says that the GLA under Johnson publicly disclosed some of the report\u2019s positive conclusions, but held back the negative ones.  \u201cThe crux of the report was about understanding the inequalities of air pollution, so they chose not to make public the findings regarding inequality,\u201d Katie King told the Guardian. \u201cThe information that they did take from the report was the positive, that exposure was predicted to fall in the future.\u201d (You can now read the full document, titled Analysing Air Pollution Exposure in London). For now, it\u2019s impossible to say whether Johnson personally intervened to prevent the report\u2019s publication.  But what is clear is that the report\u2019s findings - that of the 433 primary schools in the capital affected by illegal pollution, 83% were deprived schools - were as politically toxic as the air in question.
