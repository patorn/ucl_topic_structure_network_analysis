  "body": "Mauricio Pochettino admitted Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s 5-1 defeat against 10-man Newcastle United was his \u201cworst day\u201d in management and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d by the team\u2019s performance. The result, coupled with Arsenal\u2019s 4-0 win against Aston Villa, meant Spurs once again failed to finish the season ahead of their north London rivals, dropping to third in the final Premier League table.   Related: Georginio Wijnaldum leads Newcastle in astonishing rout of Tottenham    \u201cFirst of all I would like to apologise to our fans,\u201d said the Argentinian whose side have fallen apart since losing out on the title to Leicester. \u201cOur team was terrible for them; to our families, too. I feel ashamed. This wasn\u2019t the team that played all season. It\u2019s my worst day in management, not just in England but Spain, too. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a tactical problem, it wasn\u2019t about physical conditioning \u2013 we need to improve our mentality. Today we could see from the beginning that we weren\u2019t ready to compete and we don\u2019t have enough quality to only play with the ball. We need to run, we need to give 100% and be aggressive.\u201d Finishing beneath Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side only exacerbated the pain. \u201cWe wanted to finish second. I feel very bad about being third and not finishing above Arsenal; we showed we don\u2019t care about our position in the table,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThis upset and disappointed me. If we want to fight for big things in the future we need to avoid performances like today. We have to fight. I was very disappointed, very upset.\u201d It was a surreal atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park with the home team already relegated but the fans singing Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s name for 90 minutes in the hope of persuading him to stay. Newcastle, who had Aleksandar Mitrovic sent off for a shocking tackle on Kyle Walker, were watched from the directors\u2019 box by Mike Ashley, who will hold talks with Ben\u00edtez this week. The Spaniard is likely to find it very hard to walk away now. \u201cIt was amazing, I was flattered before, but now \u2026\u201d he said after being serenaded for the entire match. \u201cIt was emotional. I was hoping to talk before, but now I\u2019m even more open to talking. We still have to sit down but it\u2019s not easy to leave a club like this.\u201d   Related: Arsenal finish second as Olivier Giroud hat-trick sees off Aston Villa    Even so there was a distinct sense of what might have been. \u201cWe knew if we played without fear we could be like this,\u201d said Steve McClaren\u2019s successor who, if only he had only arrived before March, would surely have saved Newcastle from relegation. Instead the fact they ended the season on a six-game unbeaten run was no consolation. Indeed the only hope of a bright future on Tyneside seems to rest with the Spaniard saying \u201cyes\u201d to Ashley. This being Newcastle much can still go wrong but when someone shouted \u201csee you back here next season Rafa,\u201d Ben\u00edtez did offer a thumbs up signal in return.",
