  "body": "\u201cMost entrepreneurs I know have at some point lost the lot \u2013 including me. Twice.\u201d says Stuart Miller, founder of delivery solutions company ByBox, which reported a turnover of \u00a373m last year.  ByBox was very far from an instant success. Months of pitching resulted in not a single customer and Miller had to slink back to the UK with nothing to show for his efforts. However for this entrepreneur, as for so many, one failed venture didn\u2019t daunt his ambition to build a successful company. Serial risk takers If you\u2019re going to understand why serial entrepreneurs keep at it, Miller says, it\u2019s important to grasp that what drives them isn\u2019t flashing dollar signs. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of myth that entrepreneurs do it to make money \u2013 there\u2019s a saying that \u2018the harder you chase money the faster it runs,\u2019\u201d he laughs.      Gavin Wheeldon CEO Purple    There are attributes that will help you start a new business when a previous idea has tanked \u2013 a breezy lack of concern about being poor is a vital liberating factor for entrepreneurs, who by definition must take risks to have a chance of succeeding. But as well as the self-belief and conviction that typically characterise self-starters, there are skills and knowledge to be gained from failure that shouldn\u2019t be ignored. \u201cThere\u2019s no better way of learning than doing, and failing imprints valuable lessons on your mind,\u201d says Gavin Wheeldon, CEO of Purple, which deals in \u201cintelligent spaces\u201d and has 70 staff in four countries.  \u201cI went from a fairly nice house to a one-bedroom flat and it took me a while to get back on track,\u201d Wheeldon recalls. \u201cBut if people are too afraid of failure, they won\u2019t make decisions. If you\u2019re sat there frozen by indecision, then you\u2019re not going to innovate.\u201d  Wheeldon\u2019s first business, which he set up at the age of 19, expanded too fast. Overstretched, his cashflow couldn\u2019t keep up with his growing financial commitments for salaries, and the company folded. By the time he set up a new venture at the age of 26, he\u2019d analysed the mistakes he made first time around and also went on a course to learn the skills he needed to create a financial strategy and learn how to offset risk. It made all the difference.  Important too, says Wheeldon says, is to develop a company culture that allows employees some leeway to get things wrong.\u201dIf something happens once, it\u2019s learning, if it happens twice, it\u2019s a mistake, if it happens three times we\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d he says. Purple puts significant investment into trying out new ideas, some of which Wheeldon knows won\u2019t come good. \u201cWe\u2019re always testing, then refining. Seriously, I don\u2019t think this culture values failure as it should,\u201d he says. Learning from experience     Helen Nurse, co-founder of Wonderslide World Photograph: NULL    Helen Nurse and her husband set up their first business 15 years ago. They have since have invested \u201ca huge\u201d amount of money in a number of ventures that failed, as well as one that has been a success and is still running today. Rather than being put off, Nurse explains that each failure fuelled new ideas and helped the pair to home in on exactly what it was they most wanted to do.  Last year the couple launched a new venture, Wonderslide World, that aims to inspire children creatively by getting them active, using their imaginations, problem-solving and trying out new skills through storytelling. They published a children\u2019s book, designed interactive storytelling shows and creative skills workshops and also run educational sessions for primary schools and children\u2019s parties. But this time, the pair didn\u2019t just leap in blindly with great hopes for their big idea. \u201cWe carefully analysed the market need and the potential customers, and deduced exactly what we need to deliver,\u201d says Nurse. This has resulted in a steady evolution of the business \u2013 another important learning point.  \u201cRather than rushing the development of a product as we did before, we have taken it slowly, done lots of testing with customers and used their feedback to shape the service and experience we are delivering,\u201d Nurse continues. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve come up with an idea, created it and tried to sell it, and it\u2019s not worked because we\u2019ve not really created a brand, or researched a strategy around who would buy it.\u201d This time, they are accessing their target market in lots of different ways. \u201cIt\u2019s much more slowly evolving but it\u2019s having much more success.\u201d    We are deliberately disrupting our core business... you either do it yourself, or someone else will do it for you  Stuart Miller     There are always good and bad times in any business cycle, and reacting fast to a market downturn \u2013 the Nurses have weathered two recessions \u2013 is critical to keeping a company afloat when things get tough. Downsizing decisions can be particularly painful for entrepreneurs who have recruited staff personally.  \u201cWith our first few redundancies, in the first recession, we left it a bit late,\u201d Nurse admits. \u201cWe really struggled because we felt very close to them. That hit us hard, and we had to learn some harsh lessons.\u201d When the recent recession first loomed into sight, they were more pragmatic. \u201cWe did it a bit quicker,\u201d she says. Listening to the market And if you\u2019re not to lose the shirt off your back more than once, remember to listen to what the market is telling you, says Stuart Miller.  \u201cIn Silicon Valley, I spent months traipsing up and down hearing people say that my electronic locker delivery solution wasn\u2019t going to work. If I\u2019d just listened I\u2019d have saved a lot of time and money,\u201d he says ruefully.  Knowing when to pivot and re-angle (if not entirely jettison), your precious business idea is however always delicate judgment call to make. Miller, who came back to the UK with just \u00a310,000 in his pocket, has since adapted his idea to a new business-to-business market, and made millions. But in trying to crack the consumer market again more recently with his locker concept, he failed to convince people to pay extra for a premium service, and had to cut his losses \u2013 around \u00a35m.  It was an expensive way to finally learn that the mass market isn\u2019t going to pay for this service when they can get a somewhat worse one for free. But Miller doesn\u2019t waste time with regrets \u2013 he spends most of his time \u201chorizon scanning\u201d now, so he can adapt his successful business model as society\u2019s needs change. \u201cWe are deliberately disrupting our core business and making our old lockers obsolete,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou either do it yourself, or someone else will do it to you.\u201d Content on this page is paid for and produced to a brief agreed with Kia Fleet, sponsor of the Guardian Small Business Network Accessing Expertise hub.",
