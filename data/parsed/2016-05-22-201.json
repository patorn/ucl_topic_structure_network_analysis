  "body": "Most of us are trapped in rectangular living, trying to retrofit eco-efficiency, but we could be enjoying life in a geodesic freedome. For starters, freedomes are inherently efficient: they need no intermediate columns or supporting walls. After all, a geodesic line is the shortest line between two points on the surface of a spheroid, and the sphere is nature\u2019s most efficient shape. Buckminster \u201cBucky\u201d Fuller, who created the Montreal Biosph\u00e8re in 1967, was the foremost pioneer of geodesic domes, the master of tensegrity \u2013 tensile integrity \u2013 and the reason why geodesic structures are forever associated with eco living. Out of 90 pavillions built for Montreal\u2019s 1967 World\u2019s Fair, only two are standing. And one is Bucky\u2019s famed geodome, now known as the Montreal Biosph\u00e8re, minus its acrylic shading canopy (which was lost to fire in the 1970s).Intended to be built in the middle of nowhere by inexpert hippies (kits were sold through the Whole Earth Catalog) the domes were designed to be durable and able to withstand high winds. But \u201canticipatory architects\u201d, designing after the oil shock for tough times ahead, loved their efficiency. Domes use a third less material in construction, and 33%-50% less energy than conventional houses, according to 1980s research. But this was probably the last time they were popular as residences. These days we are more familiar with them as showcase structures, such as the Eden project or Disney\u2019s Epcot. Now it\u2019s time to break out and rediscover the freedoms of freedomes. At Geo-dome you\u2019ll find kits. Go to Blackleaf for a heimplanet geodesic inflatable tent \u00a3512.95. Or get a proper geodesic structure in the form of Bouf\u2019s garden igloo (\u00a3629) that also comes with a shading canopy. For the pioneer designers and dwellers, dome living was about \u201cecosophy\u2019\u201d \u2013 a personal response to planetary crisis. Your geodome won\u2019t provide all the answers, but it gives you a harmonious space in which to ponder the future. The big picture: Flood House     Weather permitting: Flood House, the floating weather station. Photograph: Brotherton-Lock    Arts programme Radical Essex aims to reclaim the county from perceptions generated by shows such as The Only Way is Essex. I\u2019ve certainly never seen anything like Flood House on Towie. A piece of nomadic architecture by Matthew Butcher, it\u2019s a companion piece to his earlier design, Filter House. The structure asks how we might live through seasonal flooding and is a floating weather station. Well dressed: ethical handwoven bags     In the bag: a Basket Room x Jigsaw woven tote bag, \u00a3110    After pursuing careers in the mainstream fashion industry, Camilla Sutton and Holly Dutton met while studying fashion design at art college. Determined to do fashion differently, in 2014 they set up the ethical lifestyle company the Basket Room. They specialise in handwoven baskets and accessories, working directly with weaving co-operatives in rural Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda and Swaziland, using traditional techniques. Now their first collaboration with high-street stalwart Jigsaw has just launched online and in selected stores. More than 100 women in rural Kenya have worked on the limited-edition collection, which includes a basket shopper bag in a choice of two colours and a curved clutch finished with black or brown leather. Both designs were handwoven using sisal grass. Available from \u00a389 at thebasketroom.com and jigsaw-online.com Email Lucy at lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @lucysiegle",
