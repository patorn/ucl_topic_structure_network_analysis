  "body": "Leicester City will be crowned Premier League champions if Tottenham Hotspur cannot beat Chelsea on Monday night but Claudio Ranieri will not be among the millions tuning in to see the possible denouement of this season\u2019s title race. Ranieri will be flying back from Italy instead, having visited his 96-year-old mother, Renata, for lunch and will be, by his own admission, \u201cthe last man to know the result\u201d. While Ranieri is boarding a flight from Rome, Spurs will go to Stamford Bridge knowing that anything other than an away win would mean the championship being decided on the back of Leicester\u2019s 1-1 draw at Manchester United, a game that finished with Marouane Fellaini facing a possible three-match ban and Louis van Gaal accusing Robert Huth of adopting behaviour acceptable \u201conly with sex masochism\u201d. Van Gaal\u2019s argument was that Huth had pulled Fellaini\u2019s hair, provoking the Belgian into elbowing his opponent, and United\u2019s manager made his point by doing the same off-camera to a television reporter. Ranieri was far less abrasive after a result that leaves his team eight points clear of Spurs and with the opportunity, at the very worst, to clinch the title by beating Everton at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019d like to watch the game but I am on a flight back from Italy,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cI want to meet my mother, who is 96 years old, and go for lunch with her. I fly back at the same time as the match. So I won\u2019t know the result. But when we land I will hear.\u201d Anthony Martial had given United an early lead but Wes Morgan equalised nine minutes later, before the midfielder Danny Drinkwater was sent off late on for his second bookable offence. \u201cI am very sad because he will miss the next game at home,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cI hope I will not miss him. Otherwise I am so happy because we drew against a fantastic Manchester United side. \u201cWe suffered a lot because they pressed so high and without [Jamie] Vardy it was difficult to stretch the line. Psychologically it was very important to come back and, after that, we were a little more calm, moving the ball quickly and doing what we spoke about in the week.\u201d Drinkwater\u2019s second booking came from a tug on Memphis Depay when the United substitute had his foot on the perimeter line of the penalty area. The referee, Michael Oliver, awarded only a free-kick but Leicester had their own grievances when an earlier penalty appeal for Marcos Rojo\u2019s challenge on Riyad Mahrez was waved away and Fellaini was fortunate that his elbow on Huth was apparently not seen. \u201cWhen you see what Huth is doing to Fellaini, that\u2019s a penalty,\u201d Van Gaal argued. \u201cShall I grab you by your hair? What is your reaction when I grab your hair? [Grabs reporter\u2019s hair off camera.] Your hair is shorter than Fellaini but when I do that, what are you doing then? It\u2019s a reaction. Every human being who is grabbed by the hair [reacts]. Only with sex masochism it is allowed but not in other situations.\u201d Van Gaal\u2019s argument is unlikely to spare his player retrospective action and the United manager was angry to learn that Fellaini, a player notorious for elbowing offences, might face such action and a possible three-match ban from the Football Association. \u201cThen I expect, firstly, that Huth shall be getting a lot [of suspended games] because I don\u2019t think that is normal what he is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cFellaini is reacting like a human being because if I grab your hair and pull it backwards, you would also do something to me, I believe. They did it several times, I think, and the reaction of Fellaini was of a human being.\u201d Manchester City\u2019s defeat at Southampton means United are four points off the fourth Champions League qualification place. Van Gaal\u2019s team have a game in hand but the Dutchman was frustrated by their inability to build on their early lead. \u201cI have said to my players that I have seen one of the best matches of the season from my lineup but it was not enough. You have to score when you are so attacking and creating so many chances, as we did in the first half, and when you concede a set-play goal, again, that is a pity.\u201d",
