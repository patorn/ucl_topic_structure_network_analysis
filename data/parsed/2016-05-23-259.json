He doesn\u2019t work for a magazine or music blog, nor does he work for a radio station. Instead, he\u2019s the UK and Ireland editor at music-streaming service Deezer. Lee one of 50 editors working at Deezer, with similar teams in place at Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play and other rivals. The playlists these people create can have big audiences. Lee\u2019s Brand New UK playlist has just under 6 million \u201cfans\u201d on Deezer, which is people who\u2019ve added it to their favourites list, and see a notification icon when he adds new tracks. \u201cPlaylists are becoming one of the main ways people listen to music on Deezer,\u201d says Lee. \u201cNearly half of all streams on the service come from playlists now.\u201d From Lee\u2019s Brand New UK to Afternoon Acoustic on Spotify or Lads, Lads, Lads, Pints, Pints, Pints on Apple Music (no, really) playlists are becoming an important new way for people to discover music alongside traditional radio. A point hammered home when Spotify recently poached Radio 1\u2019s head of music, George Ergatoudis, to be its first \u201chead of content programming\u201d. \u2018It\u2019s one of the things humans do better than computers\u2019 I\u2019m shadowing Lee for a day to find out how his job works, from managing his playlists to pushing new music into the feeds of Deezer listeners, and meeting major label Warner Music Group to be pitched new music.   Related: Want a job making music playlists for Google? Pass the Susan Boyle test first    Lee and his peers at Deezer and rival services are a riposte to the assumption that in the music-streaming world, discovery is driven by algorithms rather than humans. He says playlist creation exemplifies this. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things humans do better than computers: deciding what tracks go well next to one another.  \u201cWhen creating playlists, I probably spend the most time on the order,\u201d says Lee, as he adds a new song to his Track of the Day playlist and emails the label behind it to let them know. As anyone who\u2019s ever agonised over a mixtape order, there are obvious parallels between today\u2019s streaming playlists, and the compilations that people have been making for one another since the dawn of the cassette format. \u201cYou can have the right tracks in a playlist, but if they don\u2019t sound right next to each other - if you listen to it all and something jars - you\u2019ll lose people,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThe data might tell you that people are skipping or stopping listening, but an algorithm wouldn\u2019t necessarily know why, or how to fix it.\u201d The data does help though. The modern streaming playlister doesn\u2019t just create playlists: they manage them, and that means keeping a keen eye on analytics about every aspect of how they\u2019re being listened to, and changing them accordingly.     Sam Lee maintains more than 100 playlists on Deezer.    Lee shows me his analytics dashboard, which shows the gender, age and geographical makeup of the audience for each of his playlists, from UK Represent Grime 2016 (heavily male, young and British) to 80s Anthems (older and more international). There are also graphs showing the \u201csatisfaction rate\u201d of his playlists and charts showing which tracks are causing spikes in skips, or people stopping listening entirely. There is even a chart comparing the performance of all of Deezer\u2019s editors, which feels a bit Hunger Games. \u201cOh, it\u2019s really competitive!\u201d says Lee, whose metrics seem to be faring pretty well in the comparison. \u201cA playlist is far more than just a tracklisting. It\u2019s about the entire journey: you have to match and exceed the user\u2019s expectations throughout. It\u2019s not just about sticking together some tracks and off we go,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thumbnail artwork could be right, the title could be great, but then if the third track is slightly not what the user is expecting, they\u2019re gone. And I\u2019ll see that here in the dashboard.\u201d Some playlists are tweaked more often than others with new tracks. \u201cI don\u2019t mess with the Chill Out playlist too much: people don\u2019t get in the bath and think \u2018I want some new music with my rubber duck\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I didn\u2019t update the Brand New playlist for a month, there\u2019d be an issue.\u201d \u2018If you support new music in the right way, you can make a difference\u2019 Lee didn\u2019t grow up wanting to be a streaming tastemaker, obviously. Like many people who spend their teenage years seeking out new bands, he wanted to be a music journalist.   Related: Spotify has six years of my music data, but does it understand my tastes?    \u201cI was in Swindon, and there were so many great bands in Swindon, Bristol and Oxford that people just weren\u2019t writing about, so I started writing about new releases and gigs for various publications,\u201d says Lee. \u201cI just wanted to promote and champion new artists.\u201d Stints writing for his local paper, NME.com and music blog The Line of Best Fit were accompanied by work as a broadcast assistant for Tom Robinson\u2019s radio show on 6Music, and the BBC Introducing new-bands show for BBC Wiltshire. \u201cI never went to university, but I was in a couple of bands, and then through writing about music I started meeting people in the industry. I was always around new music, and that cemented in me the belief that if you support new music in the right way, you can make a difference to artists,\u201d he says. Does spending most of his professional day rooting through new music reduce the buzz? Lee admits that out-of-hours, it can be hard not to hear any song and start pondering where it would fit into one of his playlists.

There was this band called Diskopunk recently who came out of nowhere with a track called Antonio America. I was like \u2018I have to find out everything I can about this band right now!\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling, just like the first time I heard David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust album in my Dad\u2019s car when I was young. I was just enthralled by this music, and I had to get him to leave the keys in the engine so I could hear the whole thing.\u201d In 2016, Lee is at the sharp end of a bulging pipeline of new music from major and independent labels, as well as a growing number of artists operating on their own terms. Many grime artists, for example, get their music on to Deezer and its rivals through independent digital distributors, without a label being involved. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a sales or digital person pushing it, they really are bringing it back to the DIY ethos,\u201d says Lee, who has used his grime playlist to promote artists like Stormzy, Lady Leshurr and Skepta to Deezer users. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acoustic afternoon, it\u2019s more fireside evening\u2019 As playlists generate an increasing share of music streams, the bigger labels are keen to pitch their new releases to the playlisters \u2013 the streaming equivalent of the \u201cplugging\u201d they do to get the tracks on to radio playlists. \u201cWe do see now labels coming to us and pitching for specific playlists. I\u2019ll sometimes end up in conversations where I say \u2018actually, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acoustic afternoon, it\u2019s more fireside evening,\u201c says Lee. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got no qualms in saying to them \u2018no, this track doesn\u2019t work\u2019. This isn\u2019t about me and what I like, it\u2019s about understanding our audience \u2013 who they are and what they want \u2013 and serving them the music that they\u2019ll love through my own filter.\u201d Does that ever end in arguments? \u201cIf there is a track that I think is absolutely shocking, it doesn\u2019t get featured,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cLabels can push you and tell you it\u2019s a big one for them, but you have to keep your editorial tone.\u201d     Emerging artists like Dua Lipa are pitched to playlisters like they would be plugged to radio stations.    This conversation takes place before a visit to Warner Music for a pitch meeting, where Lee sits down with a label representative to be played new tracks from big artists like David Guetta and Biffy Clyro as well as emerging acts like Anne Marie, Lukas Graham, Dua Lipa and Zak Abel. Unsurprisingly, given the presence of a journalist, there are no stand-up rows over \u201cabsolutely shocking\u201d tracks. Instead, the conversation focuses on marketing activity around the releases, as well as what the artists might be able to do for Deezer. This, it turns out, is a growing part of the music marketing machine. Where artists would once have focused purely on print, TV and radio interviews, now they\u2019re also setting time aside to work with streaming services: from live sessions and video interviews to creating their own playlists with audio commentary or taking over the streaming service\u2019s Twitter account for a day. It\u2019s a relaxed meeting, with the most spirited debate focusing on whether Zak Abel\u2019s startling video where he sings and dances while playing Olympic-level table-tennis really was a single take (it was).            \u2018An 18 year-old musician won\u2019t remember not having streaming\u2019 Back in his office, Lee updates a suitably-complex spreadsheet of upcoming release dates and marketing activity \u2013 \u201cIf I tried to keep it in my head I\u2019d go mad\u201d \u2013 and reflects on the changing relationship between labels and streaming services. \u201cIn the three and a half years I\u2019ve been here, the conversations with labels have changed entirely. When I started it was all \u2018is streaming good for the music industry, is it killing everyone?\u2019 But we\u2019ve seen those conversations shift,\u201d says Lee.   Related: Is Apple Music worth paying for?    \u201cMore and more people accept that streaming as an idea is a good one. Being included in the charts has made a difference, and for younger artists it\u2019s accepted. In the not-too-distant future, an 18 year-old musician from Sweden or France won\u2019t remember not having streaming.\u201d The playlisters working within Deezer, Spotify and their rivals don\u2019t have to get directly involved in the important music-industry debates about how much money streaming pays out to labels and publishers, and how that money is then distributed on to artists and songwriters. These curators may, however, be part of the streaming companies\u2019 defence against claims that they only pay off for the biggest artists. \u201cStreaming is great for big artists: for a Justin Bieber it\u2019s hard to argue that it\u2019s anything but a good thing given how much he\u2019s being streamed,\u201d admits Lee. \u201cBut the exciting thing for me is when you come down a couple of levels to where it\u2019s artists making money they weren\u2019t before, and reaching an audience they weren\u2019t reaching before. As well as people finding great music they love, whether it\u2019s got a big marketing campaign behind it or not. It\u2019s something I\u2019m passionate about. You have to be, in this job.\u201d \u2022 Want a job making music playlists for Google? Pass the Susan Boyle test \u2022 Spotify has six years of my data, but does it understand my tastes?",
