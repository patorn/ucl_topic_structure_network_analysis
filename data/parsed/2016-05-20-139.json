  "body": "My mother is charming, bright and often very lovely. She\u2019s also a neurotic mix of guilt-tripper, tantrum thrower and hypochondriac. Our family revolves around her moods and sicknesses. Her hypochondriac behaviour is escalating. It has always been an issue \u2013 my siblings and I had several operations each before we left home, some of which she now tells me she knew were unnecessary. I know why she struggles and why she involves us. She was emotionally and sometimes physically neglected as a child, growing up in the middle of a large family, constantly ignored. I\u00a0get that she\u2019s stuck as that child \u2013 her tantrums make it clear that she\u2019s less emotionally mature than my seven-year-old daughter.  I\u2019m not particularly nice or patient. I resent having to be the adult, to be the bigger person. My father always colluded with her and never challenged her behaviour. She\u2019s terrified of growing old, to the point where my family and I remained in the UK when we were looking to emigrate, as my older sister has with her family. I have agreed that I\u2019ll be there for my mum and my dad as they get older. She\u2019s terrified at the idea of going into a home, so I\u2019ve promised I\u2019ll be there.  I hate to admit it but I don\u2019t do all of this out of love. I do it because, unlike my siblings, I can\u2019t bear the guilt trips. My mother has always criticised me for being too soft, and I think she\u2019s probably right.  I know she won\u2019t change and that she needs my support. But no matter how much I remind myself that this is not her fault and that she didn\u2019t choose to be this miserable, I keep getting so angry with her for all of it.  I can\u2019t see the point in challenging behaviour that won\u2019t change, but I\u2019m so damn frustrated with trying to deal\u00a0with her. It\u2019s constantly draining. If I try to distance myself to recharge my batteries, she escalates and has a health crisis, which will snowball for days. If I try to pay her more attention to give her what she needs, she\u2019ll manufacture an argument and throw a tantrum. It\u2019s like having a toddler who is never going to grow out of it.\u00a0 So I suppose I\u2019m asking for a coping mechanism. A mantra I can repeat internally to bolster my patience.  Hang on, if the way your mother behaves isn\u2019t her fault, whose is it? She needs to take responsibility for her\u00a0behaviour. You can love someone but hate what\u00a0they do. It doesn\u2019t make you bad. I think you sound immensely kind and patient but way too understanding, and unless you change the only bit you can \u2013 the way you respond \u2013 things are just going to carry on as they are. I contacted psychoanalyst and visiting professor at University College London, Rosine Perelberg (psychoanalytic-council.org). She says that hypochondria is really about control: \u201cGenerally in hypochondria there is a double presentation: the desire to control both one\u2019s own body/mortality and those around them. It\u2019s a\u00a0form of slavery.\u201d And, indeed, you are enslaved to her behaviour, aren\u2019t you? She says there are \u201ctwo aspects to hypochondria \u2013 a terror of death but also, paradoxically, a destruction of life\u201d. The key thing, Perelberg says, is that you need to \u201cdeeply believe that you\u2019re not helping the way your mother is [by reacting the way you do].\u201d I think you need to really concentrate on this phrase. What you\u2019re doing, the way you are responding to her, isn\u2019t helping your mother. And it really isn\u2019t helping you. So why continue? Perelberg also thinks that you hit the\u00a0nail on the head when you described your mother as being like a child, \u201cAnd as with a toddler, you need\u00a0to create structures for when things happen.\u201d She thinks it is interesting that your brother only responds at certain times and that your sister had taken herself out of the situation entirely. She also notes that you don\u2019t ask for a way out \u2013 \u201cYou want to bolster your patience, not to be free but to continue.\u201d Sometimes, when destructive family patterns affect us, we tolerate them. But when they start to affect the next generation \u2013 in this case your daughter as you hinted at in your longer letter \u2013 you seem to be thinking \u201cenough is enough\u201d now. That\u2019s good, because you need to break this pattern. But how? Perelberg suggests, \u201cYou might be less interested in your mother\u2019s symptoms, give them minimal acknowledgement.\u201d You could also choose to make yourself unavailable to her at certain times. This isn\u2019t going to be easy and won\u2019t happen overnight, but when she talks about her illnesses, zone out. She\u2019ll have her health crises, let her. She has them anyway, doesn\u2019t she? Hand the responsibility for her life back to your mother because nothing you say, or do, is going to make her less \u201cill\u201d, happier or less dysfunctional. You simply don\u2019t have that power; it\u2019s futile, so stop trying. It doesn\u2019t mean that you have to stop being a loving daughter or be cruel or cut your mother out of your life. Your behaviour towards her \u2013 even at its worst \u2013 sounds far more loving than hers to you. No wonder you\u2019re angry.
