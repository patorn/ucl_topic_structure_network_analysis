Chasing a Bee Mercury Rev are a rarity in indie rock: a band who have continually evolved their sound, pushing at the boundaries of what rock music actually means over 25 years, borrowing from jazz, funk, doo-wop, techno, folk and more along the way. Compare the pristine chamber pop of last year\u2019s The Light in You with the berserk guitar fuzz of their 1991 debut, Yerself Is Steam, and you might think you were listening to different bands. In reality, though, the lineup has remained fairly stable over the years, with the core duo of Jonathan Donahue (vocals and guitar) and Sean \u201cGrasshopper\u201d Mackowiak (guitar) present throughout, joined by Dave Fridmann (bass and production) on the first seven studio albums and flautist Suzanne Thorpe on the first five. The most notable departure was original vocalist David Baker, whose vocal style and stage presence owe more to the manic energy of comedian Andy Kaufman than to the studied cool of most frontmen. Chasing a Bee \u2013 side one, track one on the band\u2019s debut album \u2013 might be Baker\u2019s tour de force, his vocals endlessly shifting from calm to angst, from humour to passion in a remarkable, unnerving performance, set off by a soaring chorus and a backdrop of exploding guitars. Thorpe\u2019s four-note descending flute riff anchors the madness.  2. If You Want Me to Stay \u201cFunky\u201d rarely appears among the adjectives used to describe Mercury Rev. And yet If You Want Me to Stay, a Sly and the Family Stone cover originally released as part of the Rough Trade Singles Club, demonstrates that Mercury Rev can funk it up with the best of them. Their version, later collected on Yerself Is Steam bonus album Lego My Ego, not only captures the original\u2019s understated funk, but also brilliantly reflects the dark desperation of early-70s Sly Stone as he retreated into drugs and paranoia. That is largely thanks to Baker\u2019s yearning, slightly deranged vocal, which bounces around over woodwind riffs and guitars that vacillate between funk and fuzz.

Meth of a Rockette\u2019s Kick Deserter\u2019s Songs, Mercury Rev\u2019s fourth album, may be their acknowledged classic. But Boces, their second, and the last to feature Baker, is the hardcore fans\u2019 favourite, a 3D DayGlo dream of a record on which all musical life abounds, from Dixieland jazz to punk. Remarkably, it came out on a major label \u2013 Columbia \u2013 in the US, with Baker telling me in 2013 that the label essentially let them get on with it. \u201cWe were trying to allow each other\u2019s freaks and difference to come out because we had a responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [Columbia] were saying, \u2018You can do what you want.\u2019\u201d On the album\u2019s mighty, 10-and-a-half minute opening track Meth of a Rockette\u2019s Kick, \u201cwhat you want\u201d turned out to be combining a tightly wound, multi-layered collage of barbershop-quartet backing vocals with harps, trombones, brushed drums, flute and controlled guitar detonations. Its astonishing attention to detail was a tribute to the production nous of Fridmann.  4. Something for Joey Depending on who you ask, the recording of Boces was either \u201cmagical\u201d (Baker), \u201ctrying\u201d (Grasshopper) or \u201cimpossible\u201d (Donahue). And yet what emerged was an album shot through with colour, light and harmony. \u201cWe were trying to capture the magic of what was happening,\u201d Baker told me. \u201cThere was humour and energy. We loved being in the studio.\u201d Something for Joey, the album\u2019s improbable lead single, exemplifies that feeling of humour and energy, with rolling guitar verses erupting into a three-note brass chorus that is pure musical release and childish joy. A live appearance on Gary Crowley\u2019s ITV music show The Beat, in which Mercury Rev performed the song surrounded by pantomime horses, a lion with a beach ball, a squid and a yeti, felt oddly appropriate given the song\u2019s crazed glee.            5. Young Man\u2019s Stride See You on the Other Side, the band\u2019s third studio album, released in 1995, represented something of a commercial nadir for Mercury Rev. Baker had departed, longtime drummer Jimy Chambers was soon to do so too, and the album sold so badly that the band apparently asked their label to drop them. That 1995 was the peak of Britpop \u2013 a style that, at its worst, was the antithesis of Mercury Rev\u2019s experimental bent \u2013 didn\u2019t help the album\u2019s fortunes. And yet for all its commercial failure, See You on the Other Side was in tune with the band\u2019s previous, well-received releases. In Young Man\u2019s Stride it even featured a song that sounds suspiciously like it could have been a hit, if released a few years earlier at the height of grunge (and possibly with Sonic Youth\u2019s more fashionable name to it). Two and a half minutes of punkish snarl and thunderous drum propulsion, it may not be the only riff-led stomp in the band\u2019s catalogue \u2013 Syringe Mouth on Yerself Is Steam sports a guitar line that bears a brilliant resemblance to the synth part in 2 Unlimited\u2019s No Limit \u2013 but its focused aggression makes it unique in the Mercury Rev catalogue, a kind of palate cleanser to wipe clean the band\u2019s unruly history.        6. The Private Psychedelic Reel \u2013 The Chemical Brothers The Private Psychedelic Reel may not be a Mercury Rev song. But it proved one of the key moments in their history, spurring a broke, disillusioned and depressed Donahue to start making music again. \u201cSomewhere in 1996 or 1997, I can\u2019t remember, nothing was happening, everything was at a complete standstill, we\u2019d barely even begun writing Deserter\u2019s Songs,\u201d Donahue told the Quietus. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Well, OK, I\u2019ve got to go out there and pump gas for the rest of my life.\u2019 Then out of the blue I got a call from Tom and Ed from the Chemical Brothers, who said, \u2018Would you like to play on a song?\u2019\u201d For the Chemical Brothers, the track, which closed their career-defining second album, Dig Your Own Hole, was a revelation, the most perfect realisation to date of their attempts to fuse electronic music with psychedelia \u2013 the sound of George Harrison pootling around on a sitar fast-forwarded to the late 90s-club scene. What Donahue actually did on it remains a mystery. He is credited with \u201cEffects [Dub \u2018tetix Wave\u2019]\u201d, the Tettix Wave Accumulator being a mysterious, oscillator-based instrument invented by Donahue and Grasshopper, which apparently takes up most of the room in Grasshopper\u2019s basement. The Chemical Brothers would go on to remix Deserter\u2019s Songs\u2019 closer, Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp, to brilliantly Balearic effect, while Mercury Rev would, some 10 years later, dabble with electronica themselves on Snowflake Midnight. 7. Tonite It Shows            When Mercury Rev eventually ascend to the great gig in the sky, Deserter\u2019s Songs will be written on their tombstone. The album, released in September 1998, is near flawless, one of those records on which not a second is wasted and every track could be a single. And yet when it was released, it felt like it had appeared out of nowhere. See You on the Other Side had flopped three years earlier and, as Donahue told Uncut in 2011, \u201cThe world wasn\u2019t exactly waiting for another Mercury Rev record.\u201d Even the fans were taken aback by Deserter\u2019s Songs. The band had experimented with musical genres over the years, but they had never changed their sound so totally. Out went frantic electric guitars and brute sonic force, in came pastoral Americana and yearning for a forgotten age. It even featured a musical saw. But it was the incredible quality of the tracks that made Deserter\u2019s Songs stand out. Tonite It Shows has an immaculate vocal performance from Donahue, which injects the straightforward nostalgia of lines such as \u201cThe way we were, the way we met / The way I lit your cigarette\u201d with spine-tingling power, his voice catching at the edges like a man overcome with the force of memory. The orchestral arrangement, reminiscent of early Disney films, is note-perfect, too.  8. The Dark Is Rising If Deserter\u2019s Songs proved a massive step forward for the band, both critically and commercially, their next two albums, 2001\u2019s All Is Dream and 2005\u2019s The Secret Migration, saw them largely stand still, using the dreamy pop template that had served them well on Deserter\u2019s Songs to diminishing returns. The Secret Migration probably deserved the panning it got from the critics, who saw it as far too generic. But All Is Dream has some fantastic songs and moments of preposterous pomp, not least The Dark Is Rising, which continues the band\u2019s tradition of brilliant album openers. The song races out of the traps with booming timpani and soaring strings, before settling into one of Donahue\u2019s most sweetly affecting melodies. If Mercury Rev were ever to make a Bond theme, this would be it.            9. People Are So Unpredictable (There\u2019s No Bliss Like Home) For the first time in their career, Mercury Rev found themselves out of ideas after The Secret Migration, having mined the pastoral seam they struck on Deserter\u2019s Songs as far as they could. They would, however, find inspiration in the most unlikely place. \u201cOur bass player Carlos was a DJ in this little nightclub,\u201d Jonathan Donahue told the Quietus. \u201cBut he would play stuff that would get the girls dancing, you know, [sings] \u201cgroove is in the heaaart\u201d, and we\u2019d sneak in there and bring in tiny synthesisers, and say \u2018OK, at the end of Groove Is in the Heart, switch into this, and see how long we could play before people noticed. Not mimicking the sound, but the feel.\u201d The result was a bunch of 30-minute-long song ideas, largely electronic, which would become Snowflake Midnight, the band\u2019s seventh studio album, released in September 2008. Their embrace of electronics was brilliantly out of place with what was happening in the rest of the musical world, coming more than a decade after British indie bands fused their own dance/rock crossover and a few years before America would \u201cget\u201d EDM. The sound of Mercury Rev propelled by a 4/4 kick, synth washes and electro-Krautrock beats (see Butterfly\u2019s Wing and Senses on Fire for evidence) proved divisive: the Guardian\u2019s Jude Rogers called the album a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d in a five-star review, while Pitchfork suggested the band\u2019s latest reinvention might not quite have hit the mark. Whatever the case, it was refreshing to hear the band try something new, and the gorgeous People Are So Unpredictable (There\u2019s No Bliss Like Home) proved that Donahue\u2019s wistful melodies could work brilliantly against electronic textures. 10. Are You Ready? It is a tribute to the band\u2019s restless creativity that when they announced their eighth studio album, no one really knew what it was going to sound like. The Light in You was the band\u2019s first new album in seven years, their first without Dave Fridmann and their first for a new label, Bella Union. The band had not been totally inactive in the break, however, with much of their time taken up with touring to promote the reissue of Deserter\u2019s Songs. This excursion into their past proved to be instructive, as Grasshopper explained. \u201cPlaying tracks again from Deserter\u2019s Songs helped us look at where we\u2019ve been, and where we were going,\u201d he said. \u201cThough by no means did we want to make Deserter\u2019s Songs 2, we did feel we had some loose ends to tie up.\u201d The Light In You does lean more towards Deserter\u2019s Songs than the lukewarm electronics of Snowflake Midnight, its sound dominated by acoustic guitars and sweet orchestral flushes and featuring some of their strongest songs in years. Remarkably, though, Mercury Rev still manage to explore new musical paths on the album, with Sunflower dashing through film-soundtrack funk, while Rainy Day Record features \u2013 I kid you not \u2013 the band\u2019s first excursion into rap (or rhythmic spoken word, if there\u2019s any difference). The best track, though, is the one that sounds most like the Mercury Rev of very, very old: Are You Ready? hints at the massed guitars and surging choruses of Boces or Yerself Is Steam \u2013 a sound that, it appears, is as evergreen as Mercury Rev themselves.",
