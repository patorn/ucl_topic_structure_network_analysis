  "body": "Applying to university used to be like queuing for the best club in town: you\u2019d wear your coolest clothes (a brilliant personal statement), try to impress the stony-faced bouncers (admissions tutors) and hope they\u2019d let you pay \u00a39,000 for an exclusive place on the dancefloor \u2013 that\u2019s a seat in a lecture theatre.   Related: University league tables 2017    But supply and demand have now been shaken up. New government rules allow universities to take as many students as they like, so even some top-ranking institutions are making unconditional offers and giving out cash bursaries worth thousands in an attempt to fill their courses.  Yet at the same time, changes to A-levels, such as the removal of most January AS-level exams, mean some universities are struggling to select students from predictive grades alone and are \u00adintroducing entrance exams and interviews. For year 12s, the already stressful process of applying to university may now seem more confusing than ever. Some may want to opt for a university with unconditional offers to benefit from a more relaxing final school year. Others are worried about how to pick a course and find out which degrees improve graduate prospects. Here, university admissions experts tackle some year 12 students\u2019 university FAQs.      Q: Should I study something I love, or a subject more geared to getting a job? Megan Thompson, 17, is studying \u00adphotography BTec at Guildford College, Surrey \u201cI am feeling torn between photography, and the social sciences: philosophy, sociology and political science. Photography is my passion. I love taking photos and I love the fact that it means you can travel the world in your career, plus I\u2019m getting distinctions, so my studies are going well. But while I wanted to do something that I enjoy at school, I don\u2019t feel I have that luxury when I apply to university.  \u201cGetting a job in photography is too uncertain \u2013 you make it, or you don\u2019t. I want to make money straight away so I need a good job to do that. That\u2019s why social sciences seem a better option. I do feel it\u2019s important to study something you are passionate about, but I think in the current climate you need to be career-savvy. When the high fees at university mean you\u2019re taking on heavy debts, so young, and you\u2019re paying them back for the rest of your adult life, don\u2019t you have to think completely practically?\u201d Answers \u201cIf you study something you love, you are more likely to succeed in your studies and enjoy your time as a student,\u201d says Ami Solomon, education liaison manager at the University of Greenwich. \u201cAt the end you will still graduate with a degree, and be eligible to apply for the many jobs open to graduates of all disciplines. Remember that photography degrees offer the chance to develop other skills as well, such as editing, post production, programming and digital animation. \u201cTo help you make up your mind go to open days and ask what jobs former students are doing. Explore the \u00adpotential career paths of both degree options. You may be surprised how many alumni are in very different fields.\u201d Philip Bloor, head of admissions at Sheffield Hallam University, adds: \u201cFor careers purposes, a degree offers much more than its academic content. Look into different courses\u2019 links to industry and options to gain experience, like a placement year, and check if courses are accredited by relevant industry bodies.  \u201cBut remember that you don\u2019t necessarily need to study a course in a specific subject to gain employment in that area. It\u2019s also worth considering the international element: is there an option to study or work overseas for part of the course?\u201d       Q: How can I get an unconditional offer? Ethan Thomas, 17, is studying politics, history and business studies at Esher college in Surrey \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go to university, and studying events management or marketing is currently top of my list, but I\u2019m already feeling the pressure of the new linear A-level style, where we have to learn and remember much more than when AS-levels counted towards the final grade. So I am tempted by the new unconditional offers. It makes life a lot less stressful \u2013 they give you a safety net. I wouldn\u2019t go for a course offering unconditional offers if I felt another was more suitable for me elsewhere, but I\u2019d like to find out more about tracking these places down. \u201cI do feel our year group has been hard done by: I\u2019m worried about the impact of the removal of the cap on places. There could be loads more students and not enough facilities \u2013 especially accommodation. Last year, my sister had trouble getting into halls because so many applied. It might be worse for my year.  \u201cI\u2019ve also seen more unis starting to interview and run entrance exams. Before, if you weren\u2019t aiming for Oxbridge you didn\u2019t have to worry about that. Now I\u2019m seeing other universities starting exams or interviews, which puts me off \u2013 it adds a lot more pressure.\u201d Answers Sarah Lee, admissions tutor, University of Leicester, responds: \u201cYour questions highlight concerns many applicants have: it\u2019s a hugely stressful time. So, anything that can take some pressure off you is great, and unconditional offers do just that.    Related: So much for A-level \u2018rigour\u2019: universities are taking anyone    \u201cLots of universities are now making unconditional offers but often don\u2019t publicise it. If you have heard of a case, ask that university. If you\u2019re interested in a particular course, ask the admissions tutor in that department, or go to the main admissions office. However, some people take their foot off the pedal and don\u2019t do themselves proud in their exams which isn\u2019t good: employers will always look at your A-level results even once you\u2019ve done a degree.  \u201cInterviews at universities vary hugely, from formal interviews to a casual chat. See it as something positive; you\u2019ll be finding out about the degree and the university and it\u2019s as much about you deciding whether you like them as whether they like you. My advice? Choose the place you think you\u2019ll be happiest, the degree you want to do and go for it.\u201d Steve Robinson, head of student recruitment at the University of Kent\u2019s business school: \u201cThe removal of the cap hasn\u2019t led to a huge expansion in places, at least not yet. And many universities, including my own, have invested heavily in infrastructure and cutting-edge student accommodation. It could be argued that this coming year is the most exciting and vibrant time to be applying for university, with facilities and support at an all-time high at many institutions.\u201d Q: I don\u2019t feel ready. Where do I even begin?  Antonia Essilfie-Conduah, 17 (main \u00adpicture) is studying A-levels in psychology, biology and history at All Saints Catholic school in Dagenham, Essex \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a really big jump from school to university, and I\u2019m worried about how to prepare. I\u2019m going to apply for psychology \u2013 I want to go into clinical psychology \u2013 and I\u2019m searching for the best courses on university websites and prospectuses, and comparing student satisfaction ratings and accommodation options. But there should be a manual on what to read up on. What skills do I need to learn now? What do unis want from us? \u201cI\u2019m glad my subject won\u2019t be totally new \u2013 I\u2019m studying it at A-level \u2013 but I\u2019m concerned about there not being as much support. At school, teachers help you plan and organise essays, but at university you\u2019ll be on your own. I\u2019d like to know how to prepare \u2013 what should I be reading now?  \u201cI\u2019m also thinking a lot about living away from home: do they have a support network, what happens if you\u2019re ill? Oh, and, I need to brush up on my cooking and how to survive.\u201d Answers Kathy Olivant, undergraduate admissions manager at the University of Hull, says: \u201cIt is a big jump, but that makes it exciting. Without the constraints of a full school day at university you\u2019ll have more time for research, voluntary work, sport, music or a new hobby. As you research universities, find out if they have societies that cover your interests or the option to start your own. \u201cSome students have as few as six contact hours a week. It won\u2019t be like school, where teachers constantly remind you of deadlines, so that skill of independent working is something to hone now.  \u201cOver summer, check out course reading lists, and learn how to work a washing machine and make spaghetti bolognese and a good curry, so when you are dealing with other new stuff you will be able to look after yourself.\u201d Sue Metcalfe, Anglia Ruskin University\u2019s head of admissions, adds: \u201cSpeak to students at open days, on online forums and in Facebook groups for subject areas and unis. Everyone feels the same, and tutors understand the academic transition is difficult and run study skills sessions. Universities want students to succeed \u2013 they don\u2019t want them to fail \u2013 and will help as much as they can.\u201d      Q: Which careers can I go into afterwards?  Callum Pal, 17, is taking maths, further maths, physics and chemistry A-levels at Oldham sixth-form college, Greater Manchester \u201cI didn\u2019t know I wanted to go to university until year 10, when I decided I wanted a career in astrophysics. I\u2019ve struggled to find info on careers graduates of the courses I\u2019m interested in go into. I want to find a job as an astronomer at an observatory, or doing research at a university, so I\u2019d like to know if others have done so. Plus I\u2019m keen to find out which unis have a graduate network offering careers advice from recent graduates.\u201d   Related: How do I become ... an astronomer?    Answers Patrick White, admissions tutor at Leicester University, says: \u201cUniversities do publish information on their websites of the kind of careers that graduates have followed, prospectus entries and course brochures, but they are not exhaustive. Academic staff are happy to discuss careers in more detail at open days. If you can\u2019t find information for a course, contact the admissions tutor from the relevant department.  \u201cThe best way to find out how good careers services are is to ask current students or graduates, via social media or on open days. You should ask, too, if you\u2019d still be able to use the careers service after graduation, and whether former graduates are invited back to share their experiences. We do this at Leicester and it allows current students to build useful networks, and discuss their own plans with those who are established in their chosen field.\u201d      Q: I have only a vague idea what I want to do. How do I even start to pick a course? Joscelyn Turner, 16, is studying art, psychology, sociology and English literature and language A-levels at Peter Symonds college in Winchester, Hampshire \u201cI\u2019m just starting to look into degree options and it\u2019s a bit bamboozling, mainly because I don\u2019t yet have one course in mind. I\u2019m considering a career in marketing or maybe \u00adjournalism, so courses such as \u00admarketing communications and brand management, public relations and advertising have caught my eye.  \u201cBut the universities\u2019 websites can be hard to navigate \u2013 there are so many dropdown tabs. You have to know exactly what you want to find out. I\u2019m speaking to people I know in marketing to see which courses and unis they rate. What else should I consider? \u201cAnother concern is money. I\u2019d love to know a proper, estimated cost of university with everything combined \u2013 course fees, average accommodation costs, food \u2013 and the level of pressure. The university\u2019s ethos is important. If exams are constantly mentioned then that could ruin the university experience for me; I\u2019d feel I was part of an exam factory.\u201d Answers \u201cAs well as prospectuses, there are lots of sites for comparing courses,\u201d Carys Roberts, head of student recruitment at Bangor University, says. \u201c\u00adUnistats is the official site for undergraduate courses, while review sites such as What University are useful, and you could post questions in a forum such as The Student Room to ask students what they think of their courses. These are great places to investigate a university\u2019s atmosphere, frequency of exams and anything else you\u2019re worried about.  \u201cAllocate plenty of time to attend open days, where you can listen to staff and students talking about the course and the university, and ask questions. \u201cOn the money side, average weekly costs can amount to \u00a3200: accommodation of \u00a390-\u00a3120 a week, and food and entertainment of around \u00a380 per week. It depends on the location. Remember that the maintenance loan is the cheapest loan so use it, rather than considering payday loans or credit cards.\u201d      The price of a pint can teach you a lot about the cost of living. Photograph: Alamy    Other things to consider \u2013 like how much is a pint of beer?  1. Journey planning You may think you want to be 20,000 miles away from your parents, but calculate all those hours travelling home (six-plus times a year) and you might think again. So check rail and coach routes, and costs. 2. The price of a pint Seriously \u2013 finding out local pub prices can be helpful. Not because that\u2019s where all your loan will be going, but because pub prices are an indicator of the general cost of living in an area, too.   Related: Seven university costs you probably haven't budgeted for    3. League tables You could concoct your own spreadsheet comparing results, ratios and employability, but you\u2019ve got A-levels to deal with. So check out the Guardian\u2019s subject-specific tables and data-delve. 4. Course content One university\u2019s English degree may focus on modern linguistics, another\u2019s ancient literature. Comparing modules (and tutors\u2019 interests) is crucial. 5. How can the university help you? Sure, you may feel like you\u2019ve got to woo unis to fall in love with you, but they want to lure you too: are there special entry schemes for clever students at struggling schools? Cash bursaries? Practical help for disabled or carer students?  6. Go off piste at open days If they\u2019re showing you one gleaming lab, look through the windows into the others. Are lecture halls full of useful technology?  7. Pillow talk If budget is your priority, what are average rents? Can you get guaranteed accommodation in the first year or is it a stressful waiting game? 8. How are the tutors? Ask around on open days (maybe don\u2019t ask a tutor, though) and browse student forums: a great professor can change your degree \u2013 and even your life\u2019s path. 9. Think offers Don\u2019t apply to courses with identical grade requirements and ensure you\u2019ve one course that could give you a (lower) insurance offer for a more relaxed year 13. 10. Relax You may feel panic-stricken at all the options, but almost every student has a brilliant time. And if it doesn\u2019t go to plan, you can always switch course or even university.      City University London rose 19 places in the Guardian University Guide    And who\u2019s best in the Guardian league table? For the sixth year in a row, Cambridge is top of the Guardian University Guide, with Oxford and St Andrews still nipping at its heels, writes Alice Woolley. So the top three are still the top three, but the big story this year is perhaps the arrival of Loughborough among the elite, sharing fourth place with Surrey, and up from 11th place last year. Loughborough has secured its position by improving in multiple subject tables, reaching top spot for fashion and textiles, second place for design and crafts, and third in mechanical engineering.   Related: University league table: Loughborough races into top five    City University London, meanwhile, has shot up 19 places to No 18 on the table, largely thanks to improvements in the levels of satisfaction expressed by students.  It\u2019s less good news for Leicester, which has fallen 15 places to 47th. Levels of student satisfaction, historically high at Leicester, have declined over the past four years. Economics, law, history and maths all suffered, with a fall-off in career prospects a contributory factor for these three subjects.  At subject level, there was big change at the top of the social policy and administration rankings. The London School of Economics skips from 11th to first, while Swansea comes from even further back to second place. Edinburgh jumped from 12th to first for sports science and Robert Gordon leaped from 17th to second for journalism (Cardiff is top). In general, such jumps at the top of the tables are uncommon: 29 of our 54 subjects are topped by last year\u2019s incumbents. The Guardian league table scores are based on factors of interest to potential undergraduates, such as staff/student ratios, graduate career prospects and how students rate their teachers.
