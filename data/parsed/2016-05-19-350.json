  "body": "Spoiler alert: this piece discusses plot points up to and including season three of Rake. I was once arrogant enough to believe that Rake \u2013 the fourth season of which debuts on Thursday \u2013 was just another talky, smart-arse ABC drama replete with quirky characters, a courtroom setting and political commentary. Then I actually watched it. Properly. And dear Christ was I wrong. From the start, critics have relished Richard Roxburgh\u2019s performance as the chaotic, lovable Cleaver Greene. The character lets Roxburgh, who co-created the comedy/drama, be both a character actor and a leading man. Roxburgh\u2019s Cleaver is endearing, infuriating and evilly funny, solidifying the actor\u2019s place in the public eye after decades of smaller, great performances on screen and stage as well as his own directorial feature, Romulus, My Father. Rake has also been praised for its behind-the-scenes dramatic pedigree. Co-writer Andrew Knight\u2019s fingerprints are all over the show. He was a key writer on SeaChange, and Rake takes on a bit of that program\u2019s melodrama and heightened dramatic tone. Rowan Woods of The Boys and Little Fish is a recurring director, as is Kate Dennis, who directed much of Love My Way \u2013 another Australian television classic.   Related: Richard Roxburgh on Rake, Donald Trump and the 'immeasurable madness' of the nanny state    It\u2019s hard to miss the show\u2019s rich, no-bullshit Australian vernacular, rare as that way of speaking is these days. It\u2019s always \u201cI reckon\u201d, rather than \u201cI guess\u201d. Roxburgh himself told the Fairfax Media that \u201cit\u2019s a homage to an older Australia when you hear Cleaver say \u2018what the blue blazers\u2019 or, \u2018What the Dickens is going on here?\u2019 I think there\u2019s a strong attachment to that older, powerful Australian vernacular that existed in previous generations before the infiltration of MTV.\u201d And who can overlook the film\u2019s politics. Rake uses its courtroom setting to do the impossible: skewer the usually deeply pleasureless subject of New South Wales state politics with wit and inventiveness. In a Chaser-free TV landscape, Rake has stepped in to provide reliable, weekly analysis of a dying political system that parodies itself. All of that acclaim is true. But I\u2019m surprised by how rarely reviewers note the emotional heart of Rake: the characterisation of a brilliant barrister who is also a brilliant dickhead; who feels the world in brilliant extremes. Though Cleaver longs to be a good man, he continues to self-sabotage: he has messed up his marriage to Wendy, sets a terrible example to his son, falls in love with his sex worker, carries on with the booze and the drugs, disappoints his sisters and betrays his heroic best mate Barney \u2013 the all-round good bloke Cleaver will never be \u2013 by sleeping with his wife.  The only thing Cleaver reliably continues to be good at is his job, which most often involves defending terrible people. Maybe the insane bastard\u2019s greatest contradiction is that he really believes in his work and in the letter of the law: for all his rule-breaking and associating with organised criminals, he continues to defend the indefensible because of his very traditional, very conventional and very democratic belief that everyone \u2013 even the most heinous cannibal, the most corrupt pollie \u2013 deserves a proper defence. Rake is about how to be good \u2013 and, despite his notoriety, that\u2019s what Cleaver longs to be.     Richard Roxburgh as Cleaver Greene and Keegan Joyce as Fuzz. Photograph: ABC    \u201cI\u2019m gonna be good now, I swear. No more women, no more wine, no more marching powder. I\u2019m a changed man,\u201d Cleaver tells Wendy, in the first episode of season four. \u201cDo you believe me? You have to believe me!\u201d  It\u2019s this pleading \u2013 this urgent desire not just to change but to know that the people he\u2019s loved and deceived know he\u2019s changed \u2013 that makes Cleaver so complex and so real. For all the show\u2019s antics and courtroom games, Rake is a compassionate, complicated, humane show about an extreme personality trying to check his most self-destructive tendencies. After previewing the first two episodes, season four promises to deepen its anti-hero\u2019s dilemma.  Cheat sheet   Related: Rake box set review:  teeming with sex, violence and smart dialogue    Who are the brains behind the show? Richard Roxburgh, Peter Duncan, Andrew Knight and the producer Ian Collie got together to make a series inspired by the Sydney barrister and known loose unit Charles Waterstreet. From that basis, the show asks the question, \u201cCan a person ever change or is your essential nature fixed forever?\u201d What\u2019s the rundown so far? There\u2019s been cheating, lying, scandal and shenanigans. Season three ended with Cleaver and Barney reuniting in friendship, Barney\u2019s ex-wife, Scarlet, starting a new relationship with the NSW Labor hack David Potter, and the beautiful Missy jetting off to the US for a fresh start. They\u2019re all trying to throw their pasts away or reboot themselves in some way. Where\u2019s it set? Sydney locals will recognise Taylor Square, Martin Place and the Courthouse Hotel in the first couple of episodes of season four. There\u2019s something wonderful about seeing places you know and love on screen \u2013 the bus stops you\u2019ve waited at, the anonymous corners you\u2019ve passed: all the tiny spaces that let us know Cleaver\u2019s Sydney is a real place.      Roxburgh as Cleaver Greene: what a joy it is to watch an actor having so much fun on screen. Photograph: ABC    Where does Richard Roxburgh stop and Cleaver Greene start? Who bloody knows. By this point, the actor is cleary so comfortable in his character, he makes his performance look easy. Of course, it\u2019s not \u2013 Cleave is deeply narcissistic and borderline insane. But Rox\u2019s performance is what makes us as audience members buy into the complexities of the character. And what a joy it is to watch an actor having so much fun on screen. What\u2019s Rake\u2019s take on NSW state politics? Simon Burke\u2019s boof-headed cop sums it up best: \u201cThis state is rancid, it\u2019s poison at every level.\u201d Who are the legitimately awesome guest stars?  Previous seasons of Rake have featured such acting greats as Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Rachel Griffiths and Toni Collette. This season\u2019s cameos involve the wonderful Miriam Margolyes, Julia Blake in a lovely recurring performance, and the legendary Indigenous actor Jack Charles. And Offspring\u2019s John Waters is glorious as Cleaver\u2019s latest nemesis. Who is Cleave\u2019s great love? That\u2019s a tough one. Cleave is that person who still loves everyone he\u2019s ever loved. For a while it seemed as though Rake was following in the footsteps of The Office \u2013 a satire that was really a trojan horse for a two-season love story between dorky, sweet Dawn and Tim \u2013 by setting up a long-winding and inevitable romance between Cleave and Missy.  But Cleave\u2019s new love, Felicity (Jane Allsop of House Husbands), seems legit. She\u2019s a strong, smart, switched-on woman with no tolerance for Cleave\u2019s bullshit, and that zero-tolerance thing seems to be what\u2019s tying them together: Cleave hasn\u2019t freaked out yet but his capacity to not mess it up will be critical to the development of his character. \u2022 Season four of Rake premieres on the ABC at 8.30pm on 19 May",
