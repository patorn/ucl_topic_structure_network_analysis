The show had been due to start at 8pm. Hill reportedly arrived on stage at 10.20pm and at 11pm her microphone was cut due to the venue\u2019s strict closing time.  Many in attendance expressed their outrage about the situation on social media.    $89.50 tickets not including the fees associated with the ticket purchase & Lauryn Hill is over 2 hours late\u2014 SugahRush (@MissNikkiNY) May 7, 2016      Lauryn Hill just came out up nearly 2 and a half hours late to boos. Yikes!\u2014 Jewel Wicker (@jewelwickershow) May 7, 2016    In a video posted on Twitter, Hill seemed to blame her driver for arriving late.       But many defended the singer, noting that Hill is known for her tardiness. In 2014 she kept an audience in London waiting for up to 90 minutes.  Associated Press contributed to this report",
