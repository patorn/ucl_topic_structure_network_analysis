Police in the southern German city said they were ready to respond and were \u201cfully determined\u201d to prevent a repeat of violent clashes that saw more than 400 demonstrators arrested outside the rightwing party\u2019s first full conference in Stuttgart last month. \u201cWe hope everything will go peacefully but if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re ready,\u201d a spokesman said. A court ruled on Thursday that the renowned Hofbr\u00e4ukeller tavern, on Munich\u2019s central Wiener Platz, could not cancel a contract it had signed with AfD before the Stuttgart conference and must allow the event to go ahead.

Photograph: Marijan Murat/EPA    The beer hall\u2019s landlord, Ricky Steinberg, had argued that \u201ca significant number of peaceful and/or violent demonstrators\u201d posed a serious security risk, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reported, and that other guests would suffer unnecessary \u201cdiscomfort, inconvenience and worry\u201d. The AfD filed a formal complaint, saying the contract was binding and a \u20ac6,000 (\u00a34,700) deposit had been paid. It also threatened to claim a five-figure sum in damages if Steinberg pulled out of hosting the event, at which the party leader, Frauke Petry, is due to speak.  Munich\u2019s state court disagreed with Steinberg, saying speculation and fear of possible violence did not amount to \u201cconcrete evidence of an actual threat\u201d and were not a sufficient reason for cancelling a contract. Peaceful protests could not be considered a danger, it added, and full security measures would be in place.  The court also noted that Steinberg had written to the AfD since the Stuttgart conference \u2013 at which the party backed an election manifesto declaring that Islam was not compatible with Germany\u2019s constitution \u2013 saying he was looking forward to the event, and warned that any loss of earnings the landlord might suffer should be considered \u201ca direct result of the decision to sign the contract\u201d.

Support for the rightwing, populist AfD has surged amid Europe\u2019s refugee crisis and the arrival of more than a million migrants and refugees in Germany last year. Now polling at 12-14% nationwide, the party, which wants to ban minarets and the burqa, holds seats in half of Germany\u2019s 16 state parliaments and could win national representation in next year\u2019s general elections. AfD, which expects about 300 members at the event, said on Thursday it \u201cneither needed nor wanted the support of rightwing extremists\u201d, but complained of a \u201cnationwide bullying campaign\u201d by opponents who were using \u201cundemocratic and sometimes criminal methods\u201d. Hitler\u2019s first political speech was made at the Hofbr\u00e4ukeller on 16 October 1919. Since used by mainstream parties including the left-leaning Social Democrats, the beer hall is a popular traditional Bavarian venue for Munich locals and tourists alike.",
