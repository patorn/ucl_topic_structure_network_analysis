  "body": "My husband of 14 years never gives me compliments. This isn\u2019t new \u2013 he\u2019s always been like this. Maybe a couple of times a year he\u2019ll say, \u201cYou look nice\u201d but that\u2019s it. He never tells me that my hair smells great or my skin is soft, or he loves my legs in that skirt. It has a negative effect on our sex life since I don\u2019t feel very desirable to him, so we only have sex every couple of months.\u00a0 About once a year it really gets me down and I weep a lot, and question whether I can spend the rest of my life with someone who, for the most part, feels like a roommate more than a lover. I only \u201crecover\u201d from these periods when the rest of life, like the children, takes over and I get distracted by other things. I\u2019ve explained all of this to my husband. He hates to see me upset, but seems incapable of doing anything about it. He says it\u2019s too hard, he doesn\u2019t know what to say or he doesn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing. Sometimes, after I\u2019ve threatened to leave him, he\u2019ll make an effort for a couple of days, which shows that he can do it if he wants to \u2013 but then it\u2019s back to where we started for another year. Frankly, this is almost worse, since I know he is capable of being thoughtful if he tries. Whenever he does say something positive to me, I always make sure I react appreciatively so he knows he\u2019s getting it right. But he just gives up. He\u2019s also not affectionate nor does he do anything to make me feel special, such as buy me occasional presents or do little thoughtful things. How can I help my husband to understand what a huge impact his lack of communication is having on our lives? You say you\u2019ve been married for 14 years and he\u2019s always been like this, so I wondered what has prompted you to ask for help now? Somehow, I feel this may be significant. I consulted counsellor Sharon Breen, (bacp.co.uk) who also wondered what happened once a year to make you feel \u201creally down\u201d about it all? She thought that \u201cthis was obviously a mutually frustrating and lonely stand off\u201d, and that you both seemed \u201cstuck\u201d. She said: \u201cThe way you are dealing with the rejection, as you see it, is by withdrawing and threatening to leave. It\u2019s not helpful, although it\u2019s understandable.\u201d Breen explained that some people \u201cdon\u2019t use language the way we\u2019d like them to. There may be a basic misunderstanding, your husband may find this confusing. He will have a go at complimenting you, but it may not come naturally. Because you are feeling desperate/frustrated/rejected, I wonder if you are then dismissing his repair attempts.\u201d You say he is \u201ccapable of being thoughtful if he tries\u201d, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. I think he is able to follow instructions for a short amount of time, but it simply doesn\u2019t come naturally to him. Anyway, the whole situation, when your relationship goes into \u201crepair\u201d mode, seems very false and scripted. Not authentic at all \u2013 your husband saying things you have told him to say, you reacting appreciatively. I wonder where your idea of what relationships are meant to be like comes from? I don\u2019t mean this unkindly \u2013 we\u2019re all entitled to the relationships we want. But something must have attracted you to your husband. Has he changed? Have you? Did you hope you could change him? A lot can depend on how love was shown to him \u2013 and you \u2013 growing up. Some people never say \u201cI love you\u201d but show it in many different ways; some say \u201cI love you\u201d all the time, but don\u2019t mean it. Does he really not do anything that\u2019s loving? I don\u2019t mean the presents you mention but those little loving acts couples can do for one another? Do you ever pay him compliments? I thought your letter was very one sided about the things he doesn\u2019t do for you, no mention at all of what he does (really, nothing?) or the things you do for him (not important?). Breen also wondered about \u201cspecific compliments\u201d you wanted him to pay you, and she wondered \u201chow you felt about yourself?\u201d I thought this was an important point, maybe the key to your whole issue. \u201cThe fact that he hates to see you upset is a good sign,\u201d says Breen, \u201cas is the way he tries very hard to do what you are asking of him when you threaten to leave.\u201d What to do? Well, there is couples counselling, of course \u2013 although it\u2019s often very hard to get your partner to go (you can go alone). Breen suggested: \u201cBe curious. If possible, make requests rather than demands. Explain your feelings to him [when calm, when you are getting on most] so he understands exactly how you feel. Use lots of \u2018I\u2019 statements rather than blaming, criticising or bottling it up. Ask him more about what it\u2019s like for him to express his feelings and affection. Ask how you can help him with this.\u201d Breen also wondered if both, or one, of you was experiencing stress \u201coutside the marriage, as the way we understand our partner\u2019s behaviour is linked to the stress we are under. We are likely to be more charitable when stress is low.\u201d Your problems solved Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.
