  "body": "Joseph Phibbs\u2019s new work for the BBC Symphony Orchestra is called Partita \u2013 and yes, it has six movements whose names broadly fit with the old-style dance suite, perfected by JS Bach, that it\u2019s named after. But those movements run together with only one break to form a substantial, 25-minute work. The whole thing feels more like a concerto for orchestra in the way it revels in the orchestra\u2019s sonorities and gives solo instruments \u2013 clarinet, trumpet, cello, cor anglais \u2013 their moment in the sun. The tugging string harmonies of the opening section, titled Notturno, give way to a scurrying Courante, lightly dispatched here by the BBCSO violins under the sure direction of Sakari Oramo. But it\u2019s the Sarabande that follows on from this that finds Phibbs at his most distinctive: the stately old-style dance is made to morph into a kind of tango, punctuated by woody percussion, with an acerbic sound halfway between Britten-esque eeriness and a cabaret band. Under Oramo\u2019s baton it sounded almost witty, and it certainly leavened the lushness and forcefulness found elsewhere in the work \u2013 but it was perhaps gone too soon. Partita formed part of a meaty programme alongside two works responding to the uneasiness of the 1930s. In Bart\u00f3k\u2019s turbulent Violin Concerto No 2, Alina Ibragimova gave a solo performance of powerful and unflagging intensity. In Vaughan Williams\u2019s Dona Nobis Pacem, soprano Sarah Fox and baritone Duncan Rock sang out the Latin text and Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry, but it was the BBC Symphony Chorus whose well-enunciated, insistent singing really hit home.   On BBC Radio 3 at 7.30pm on 25 May.",
