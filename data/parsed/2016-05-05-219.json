At first it\u2019s hard to notice, but a drive through northern California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, past waves of green, manicured vineyards, makes it clear. The black ribbon of PVC irrigation pipe that typically threads the vines is curiously absent here \u2013 because Will doesn\u2019t water his crops. Bucklin\u2019s Old Hill Ranch, purchased by his stepfather Otto Teller in 1980, claims to be the oldest-rooted vineyard in the area. Teller fell in love with the vineyard because it was one of the few that still \u201cdry-farmed\u201d. Dry farming is a method that bypasses artificial irrigation, relying instead on seasonal rainfall and working the soil in such a way that it holds on to water for the drier months.  Is it possible to grow healthy grapes without watering them? Actually, if conditions are right, he says, it\u2019s possible to grow even better ones. Less water means smaller, more intensely flavoured grapes with a higher skin-to-fruit ratio. Other crops \u2013 tomatoes, potatoes, squash, corn, apples, even marijuana \u2013 can be dry-farmed too, with similarly intensified results. The Mediterranean climate of California\u2019s coastal regions, particularly those to the north, is ideally suited to dry farming. Mornings are cool, afternoons warm, and the rains come every winter. Until the second half of the last century, dry farming was actually the norm here \u2013 and still is throughout much of Europe. \u201cThe hardest part about dry farming is actually convincing people it works,\u201d Bucklin says. \u201cBut in places like Spain, France and Italy, pretty much everybody dry-farms because it makes better wine.\u201d Irrigation has even been banned in parts of Europe to preserve the quality of certain grape varieties. But in California, where irrigation is now the norm, dry farming has become a forgotten art.     Dry-farmed quinoa growing at the New Family Farm in Sebastopol, California. Photograph: Michelle Davidoff/Handout    It\u2019s been more than two years since California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, declared the drought a state of emergency. How unprecedented this drought is depends on who you ask, and how they measure it. There is broad consensus that it is the worst in centuries; some say in more than a millennium. Since then, Californians in urban areas have been required to greatly reduce their water use. The mandate to cut back by 25% has largely been met, and at times exceeded, by a population that prides itself on eco-consciousness. Strict restraints on personal water consumption, and drought shaming of those who continue to waste, have attracted headlines. Yet for agriculture, which accounts for 80% of the state\u2019s human water use, there is no parallel mandate. It\u2019s a reality that has raised eyebrows. That\u2019s not to say the industry isn\u2019t under scrutiny. In 2014, for the first time in its history, the state passed \u201cgroundwater\u201d laws that will monitor how farmers use rapidly diminishing subterranean reserves. But there is currently no statewide move to promote alternative methods of irrigation such a dry farming. As Jeanine Jones of the California department of water says: \u201cThat\u2019s a choice that growers make. It\u2019s on their side of the issue.\u201d     Will Bucklin at his dry-farmed vineyard Old Hill Ranch in Sonoma Valley. Photograph: Charlotte Simmonds for the Guardian    No dry farmer I met calls it a panacea for the state\u2019s water crisis. But they do lament the loss of an intimate, intuitive style of agriculture that has been overtaken by another: one that privileges yield over quality, and mass management over a farmer\u2019s care and attention. Dry farming certainly requires a special set of steps. The cultivation of a \u201cdust mulch\u201d, a layer of tilled topsoil that seals in moisture to prevent it evaporating from around the plant\u2019s roots, is one example. Dry-farmed vines take longer to establish, and while they may live longer they also yield less, a proposition unlikely to appeal to everyone. But the argument of quality is one that dry farmers return to in their defense. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dry-farm unless it was worth it, if I didn\u2019t think it made better wine,\u201d Bucklin says. One reason for improved flavor is that dry-farmed vines put down deeper roots; they quite literally go mining for water. \u201cIrrigated vines have roots that live in the top 20 or 30 inches of soil. Dry-farm vines can have root systems as deep as 20 to 30 feet,\u201d Bucklin says. Deep-root systems produce grapes that are more characteristic of the land they\u2019re grown on. Winemakers call this terroir, and it\u2019s the thing that sets fruit juice apart from the stuff that blows your mind. \u201cIrrigation will give you good grapes, but they tend not to be unique,\u201d Bucklin says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any soul.\u201d     Dry-farmed wine from Old Hill Ranch. Photograph: Will Bucklin for the Guardian    The Central Valley is largely inhospitable to dry farming. In this industrious backbone of the state, which alone produces a quarter of the nation\u2019s food and 40% of its fruits and nuts, temperatures are too high, the rainfall too low, the farms too large. Yet it\u2019s in the nearby Cuyama Valley where Steve Gliessman and his wife Robbie have established Condor\u2019s Hope, a five-acre farm making dry-farmed wines and olive oil. Gliessman is one of California\u2019s foremost dry-farming experts and a former professor of agroecology at UC Santa Cruz. Gliessman maintains many crops now dependent on irrigation don\u2019t really need it. He mentions almonds, the state\u2019s second most valuable crop. Fairly or unfairly, almonds have become shorthand for water inefficiency (the dinner party line goes that it takes a gallon of water to produce one almond in California). \u201cAlmonds are traditionally a dry-farmed crop that does not need irrigation,\u201d Gliessman says. \u201cThere are dry-farmed almond orchards in southern Spain that are a couple hundred years old. But when you\u2019ve got 500, a thousand acres, you don\u2019t have much opportunity to be a good steward of your land. You have to make big decisions in a hurry.\u201d \u201cWhat we learn from a system like dry farming is that you can farm from limited water,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut of course modern farming looks for maximum yield no matter what you have to put in. And in the case of California, that input is water.\u201d While new groundwater rules may be welcome, Gliessman points out they will take years to come into effect. The state has indeed given itself a generous deadline of 2040 to achieve a fully sustainable groundwater management system, with the possibility to push that back even further. \u201cMeanwhile, it\u2019s business as usual; drill as deep as you can and get as much out while you can,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at what cost? Groundwater is not an unlimited resource. And we have been drawing down on centuries of accumulation. Pretty soon those systems are not going to be able to provide for us.\u201d     Steve Gliessman and his wife Robbie Jaffe, son Erin, his wife Oriana, and Mateo at the Westside farmers\u2019 market in Santa Cruz. Photograph: Courtesy of Steve Gliessman/Handout    I meet farmer Ryan Power on his land in late April, before the start of the growing season. He and childhood friend Adam Davidoff, who run the New Family Farm, were students under Gliessman at Santa Cruz and swear by ditching the PVC pipes. \u201cI had one journalist who came here and tried our tomatoes, and he nearly shit his britches,\u201d Power laughs. \u201cSeriously, he couldn\u2019t talk for a while. When you think about irrigation as \u2018watering the tomato down\u2019, dry farming starts to makes sense to people. Would you rather have a plant that gives you more watery tomatoes, or less, absurdly tasty ones?\u201d Power currently dry-farms about half his crops, including tomatoes, squash, potatoes and pinto beans. He is especially enthusiastic about the farm\u2019s most recent experiment: dry-farmed quinoa. It\u2019s a grain with huge global demand that requires little water to grow and is not widely farmed in the US. \u201cLast year we grew over a ton of quinoa per acre without a single drop of water, during the worst drought in 600 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a staple crop, not a luxury crop like wine. I\u2019m really excited about the potential.\u201d     Condor\u2019s Hope dry-farmed vineyard in Cuyama Valley, California. Photograph: Robbie Jaffe    Back at Old Hill Ranch, Bucklin swills his glass and takes a sip of his wine. He describes the taste as \u201calmost minty\u201d. It\u2019s true the flavor is both refreshing and deep; lamb and mint sauce springs to mind. Will\u2019s neighbors, also winemakers, are irrigators. It\u2019s a reality that frustrates him, as it did his stepfather before. \u201cOtto always used to say, \u2018these goddamn vineyards are sucking up all the water.\u2019\u201d Can Bucklin foresee a future in which his way of working swings back into favor? \u201cHuman memory is very short, and very adaptable,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lived under this dry farming idea for centuries, and it\u2019s only during the last 50 or so years that we\u2019ve changed. People look at our vines and say \u2018how do you survive?\u2019 They think we\u2019re crazy. But it\u2019s really not that complicated. We make plenty of money and plenty of wine, and I think our wine is pretty damn good too. I think we\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d",
