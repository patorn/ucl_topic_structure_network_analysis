  "body": "Ken Loach has spoken about the forthcoming Brexit vote, referring to the decision as \u201ca dangerous, dangerous moment\u201d.   Related: I, Daniel Blake review: Ken Loach's welfare state polemic is blunt, dignified and brutally moving    The acclaimed film-maker was speaking at the Cannes film festival to promote his new film I, Daniel Blake, an angry social drama about working class Brits caught up in a bureaucratic struggle to receive state benefits. At the film\u2019s press conference, Loach spoke about why he thinks the decision to leave the EU is a difficult one. \u201cOn the one hand, the European Union is a neo-liberal project,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a drive towards privatisation and a drive towards de-regulation. The safeguards that are there for workers and for the environment are constantly under attack so it\u2019s not doing us any favours at the moment. On the other hand, if we leave, we know the individual governments will be moving as far to the right as possible.\u201d Loach believes the solution is ultimately voting to stay and thinks we need to \u201cmake alliances with other European left movements\u201d. Last year, the Guardian met Loach on set of his Newcastle-set drama. Despite his vocal support for Jeremy Corbyn, he said then he believed the Labour leader was failing to speak out on how the government deals with poverty. He\u2019s now saying that Corbyn\u2019s voice needs to be amplified by those around him.            \u201cI think for once there is a leadership of Corbyn and one or two of his allies who understand the interests of working class people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe speaks out but the problem is that the rest of the party in parliament wants him out and that\u2019s the problem he faces. There are people who understand what is happening but the political structures are not allowing him to be heard.\u201d I, Daniel Blake has been receiving largely positive reviews, with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw praising its \u201cfierce, simple dignity\u201d and Thursday\u2019s press screening leaving many audience members in tears. The plot, about a man who\u2019s suffered a heart attack and a single mother both fighting for benefits, is one that Loach believes is relevant across the continent. \u201cI think it\u2019s shocking because it\u2019s not just an issue for people in our country but it\u2019s an issue for people across Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a conscious cruelty in the way we\u2019re organising our lives now. The most vulnerable people are told that their poverty is their own fault. If you have no work, it\u2019s your fault that you haven\u2019t got a job. It\u2019s not just a few, it\u2019s tens of thousands and across Europe, it\u2019s massive. It\u2019s deeply shocking that this is happening in the heart of our world.\u201d Producer Rebecca O\u2019Brien, Loach\u2019s long-time collaborator, also spoke about the ways in which the film industry could be held as an example of unity across the EU. \u201cI feel quite strongly that the way that the European film community can and does work together in terms of co-productions is a really good example of how Europe can work,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a British tendency to look across the Atlantic to make films and that seems to be a money-driven operation. Whereas in Europe, cultural and important stories like ours can be told.\u201d I, Daniel Blake is showing in competition at the festival alongside new films from Sean Penn, the Dardenne brothers and Bruno Dumont.",
