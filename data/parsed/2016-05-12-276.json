  "body": "When devoted Republican Lindsay Arthurs walks into a polling booth on 8 November, she will stare at two names on the presidential ballot \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 and refuse to choose. \u201cIt\u2019s not who I want to represent me to the whole world,\u201d she says. \u201cI definitely feel cheated and slighted.\u201d Trump heads to Capitol Hill on Thursday to meet House speaker Paul Ryan, GOP chairman Reince Priebus and other Republican leaders to try to bring the party back together.  But Arthurs is among moderate Republicans for whom Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the party represents a Hobson\u2019s choice: take it or leave it. The probable Democratic alternative, Clinton, is anathema. Yet many regard voting as a sacred right and duty, so the prospect of staying at home on polling day is a painful one. Clinton was in Virginia this week to woo such voters and begin her general election campaign in earnest (the state has already held its primary). Barack Obama won it in 2012 with 51% to Mitt Romney\u2019s 48%. Republicans hoping to flip the state red this time could find Trump more hindrance than help among moderates in urban areas.     Lindsay Arthurs: \u2018I definitely feel cheated and slighted.\u2019 Photograph: David Smith for the Guardian    These are party loyalists who defy glib stereotypes \u2013 Bible bashers, rednecks, the 1% \u2013 and share the dismay of Democrats and the outside world at the presumptive nominee\u2019s outbursts against women, Mexicans and Muslims. Arthurs, from Arlington, who volunteered for Habitat for Humanity and at a food bank before motherhood took over 18 months ago, is socially liberal. \u201cI\u2019m 35 and I grew up in this world,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up learning about Aids: it was out in the open. On abortion, it\u2019s not the business of the government one way or the other. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for Trump because he\u2019s crazy and he doesn\u2019t represent the values I consider to be Republican. For a country founded on immigration, it\u2019s a slap in the face to my ancestors as well as others. On foreign policy he\u2019s a loose cannon and would be a danger in terms of China and Iran.\u201d But for Arthurs, a commercial property manager, Clinton is an unpalatable alternative. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to vote for her. As a woman I would like someone a little more respectable to be the first woman president. The Benghazi stuff is troubling, besides the fact she let her husband do all that and let him get away with it.\u201d In the town of Vienna, quality of life is high. The exclusive Westwood country club offers a golf course, gym, tennis courts and Olympic-sized swimming pool. Over the road, in an affluent suburban neighbourhood with abundant pet dogs, John Bradley has an unconventional lifestyle by Christian conservative standards: he lives with a male partner who, by the way, is a Bernie Sanders supporter. Bradley has voted Republican in every election since Ronald Reagan. But not this time.  \u201cIf the election was tomorrow, I would leave \u2018president\u2019 blank or write in Mitt Romney or Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton; I don\u2019t care for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t reflect my values at all. He embarrasses me with his behaviour and antics.\u201d    I feel discouraged about the country: that\u2019s who we are, and that\u2019s what our choices are now  John Bradley     Bradley, 56, a government employee who voted for Marco Rubio in the Virginia primary, cannot imagine switching to Clinton in November. \u201cI don\u2019t trust her at all. Even if I was a liberal, I wouldn\u2019t trust her. I think she\u2019s about power and position. She\u2019s a career politician.\u201d His lack of options on election day is bleak. He added: \u201cI feel discouraged about the country: that\u2019s who we are, and that\u2019s what our choices are now. It\u2019s hard to be optimistic that it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d     Keith Kirkland on his options: \u2018I look at it as the lesser of two evils.\u2019 Photograph: David Smith for the Guardian    At the nearby Potbelly restaurant, manager Keith Kirkland, 46, who supported John Kasich in the primary, was weighing his options. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve voted Republican most of my life but I will be hard-pressed to vote for Donald Trump. He\u2019s so much of a wild card on everything, from building the wall to kicking everybody out. It\u2019s great for reality TV, but it\u2019s not practical policymaking.\u201d And Clinton? \u201cI have considered it. I look at it as the lesser of two evils. It\u2019ll be tough to pull the trigger on that one as well. If a third-party candidate ran, I would probably swing that way.\u201d Diane Grant-Boesen, a design consultant from nearby McLean who has voted since 1968, will stay away this time. She explained: \u201cWe had many well-qualified candidates but ended up with Trump. I\u2019m very disappointed in the way he belittled the other candidates. The man is not an intellectual, not intelligent; I think he lied about his educational background. He speaks at a grammar school level. If Congress feels he is an incompetent president, he can be removed. I\u2019m hoping for that.\u201d Grant-Boesen, 69, a divorced mother of two, finds nothing appealing about Clinton either. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the woman. I hate her. My feelings towards her are very strong. She is not really for women at all; she\u2019s a career politician and she\u2019s for herself. I hope she gets indicted for the emails.\u201d     Diane Grant-Boesen on Trump: \u2018If Congress feels he is an incompetent president, he can be removed. I\u2019m hoping for that.\u2019 Photograph: David Smith for the Guardian    The frustration extends to young Republicans. Becky, 27, who did not wish to give her surname, has decided not to vote this year. \u201cI always vote Republican but I\u2019m not a huge fan of Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s very out there with his opinions. Having a celebrity as president scares me a bit. Yet asked if she would consider Clinton instead, Becky, a sales executive at a tech company, is blunt: \u201cHell no. I don\u2019t trust her. She\u2019s snaky. She\u2019s a liar. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fit for office.\u201d She admitted: \u201cI\u2019m torn. I\u2019ve been voting since I was 16 and this will be the first election when I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m probably doing myself a disservice as an American by not voting, but I don\u2019t like either party.\u201d But just as Reagan persuaded blue-collar workers to switch sides and become Reagan Democrats, so the rise of Trump looks set to spawn at least some Clinton Republicans. Judi Bradley, 49, a volunteer for the Animal Welfare League, is a liberal on issues such as abortion, gender equality and LGBT rights. \u201cI\u2019ve been a staunch supporter of marriage equality,\u201d she said.    Voting for Trump would make a mockery of our foreign policy, and the US doesn\u2019t need any help making a mockery of itself  Judi Bradley     As global head of tax for the multinational Cvent, she travels widely and learns how the rest of the world views America. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can vote for Mr Trump in good conscience,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would make a mockery of our foreign policy and, from a global viewpoint, the US doesn\u2019t need any help making a mockery of itself. \u201cWhen I talk to Republican friends, it shocks me there are colleagues of mine \u2013 highly educated professionals \u2013 who support Trump because they think it\u2019s time to put someone business-oriented in the White House. They think nationalistically rather than about the US on a global level.\u201d     Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign event in Athens, West Virginia, earlier this month. Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters    Despite concerns over Clinton\u2019s economic policies, Bradley will probably vote for the former secretary of state but is frustrated with what\u2019s on offer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear there will be a candidate I would be excited by. I\u2019m disappointed. It seems a moderate candidate \u2013 fiscally moderate and socially liberal \u2013 is incapable of winning in our primary system.\u201d Midge Biles, 50, an optometric technician, has voted Republican for 30 years but will defect to the Democrats in 2016. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen who\u2019s running, right?\u201d she asked by way of explanation. \u201cHe\u2019s a TV figure, not a leader. The only reason he\u2019s winning is he used to be made fun of so people recognise his name. It was a joke that got carried away on its own momentum. No one expected it to go this far. \u201cWe would probably have Kim Kardashian as his vice-president and then they\u2019d be really popular and the rest of the world would think less of us.\u201d Biles has come to terms with her change of allegiance. \u201cI will vote for Hillary Clinton and feel OK with that. I don\u2019t like Bill Clinton but I\u2019m much happier with that than the alternative.\u201d For others, the choice remains agonising and hinges on Trump\u2019s conduct in the coming months. Sitting at the bar of McCormick and Schmick\u2019s restaurant beneath Ernst & Young offices, Jim, 49, a sales executive who did not wish to give his surname, said: \u201cI\u2019m up in the air. I\u2019m more pro-Trump than pro-Hillary but some of the things he says are outrageous. I wish he had more decorum. I want to see what he does between now and the election. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Clinton. I\u2019m not happy with either of them. I wish there could have been a better group of Republicans and Democrats but it\u2019s a thankless job. The people who would be really qualified don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d",
