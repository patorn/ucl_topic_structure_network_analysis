Argentina had comfortably qualified for the quarter-finals after wins in both their opening games. Meanwhile, the United States knew that they would have to match or better Bolivia\u2019s result against Chile to advance. \u201cSimeone and I got into a pushing fight in the tunnel before the game,\u201d Wyanlda says. \u201cI pushed him up against the wall, and I told him I was going to smash his face in, and I\u2019m sure he told me something similar. I think that was my way of saying: we\u2019re not backing down from you guys, and we\u2019re not afraid.\u201d USA were not afraid. Daniel Passarella made changes to his side and chose to rest key players, including Simeone. \u201cWe were motivated by that,\u201d Wynalda says. \u201cWe knew we had to win, and the odds were certainly against us, but I think Passarella, some of his comments, and the fact he didn\u2019t put everyone out there put us over the edge. It was still a strong side, but I remember looking at the team sheet along with a few of the guys and thinking, well we can beat those guys.\u201d  In the opposition dressing room there was a sense of the unknown. \u201cSincerely, I personally knew very little of these footballers, even though several competed in the World Cup [of 1994],\u201d defender Roberto Ayala told the Guardian.

There was an \u2018I\u2019ve got your back,\u2019 attitude on that team. If you miss the tackle, I\u2019ll be right behind you. No one let anybody down. Our mindset was do not let them look up.\u201d With Wynalda and his team-mates crashing into tackles from the first minute, it was a pace Argentina could not match. \u201cThere was several 20-second stints where they tried to find a rhythm, and then it was a crunching tackle, a slide tackle, an elbow to their head, and they just never got a rhythm,\u201d Wynalda, who will appear on Fox\u2019s coverage of the Copa this summer, adds.            In the 15th minute, the US were forced to substitute Marcelo Balboa for Mike Burns due to injury, although the change did little to lessen the pace of their play. \u201cIt was played in the South American winter, so that helped us. It rained, and it was cold,\u201d Alexi Lalas, a member of the team that day, says of the weather at the Estadio Parque Artigas in Paysand\u00fa. \u201cIt was a small, dark type of stadium. Someone could look at it and say it\u2019s an amazing stadium filled with personality and character, while another person could look at it and say it is less than ideal.\u201d USA would earn their first reward four minutes later. A deep cross from the left fell to Cobi Jones, and his dart across the box was halted. As the ball bounced free, everyone stood motionless, everyone apart from Frank Klopas. \u201cA lot of guys told me I never looked faster than after that goal,\u201d Klopas says laughing. \u201cI just wanted to get it on frame. I managed to keep it low. I\u2019m not going to tell you I aimed for that corner, but I tried to use good technique and keep it low.\u201d Buoyed by their goal, the US continued to press. The US coach Steve Sampson had set his team out in a 3-5-2 formation, and it was constricting the Argentina midfield. Still able to fashion chances, when Argentina did test the US goal, they found an inspired goalkeeper between the posts. \u201cWhen you have guys like Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller playing in the net, you always have a chance [of winning],\u201d Klopas says. \u201cThese guys are like top goalkeepers, and I remember Kasey was fantastic that night.\u201d Now looking for a second goal, the US continued to push their bewildered opponents. \u201cIf it\u2019s a street fight, my father taught me one thing,\u201d Wynalda says. \u201cYou hit first, you hit hard, and if they try to get up you don\u2019t let them. Just because we got them down for a bit doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t get back up.\u201d Passarella\u2019s men struggled with the speed of wing-backs Jones and Earnie Stewart. \u201cNeither he [Cobi] nor Earnie were crazy about playing those positions,\u201d Sampson says laughing. \u201cHowever, they put in a tremendous effort defensively and still had the attacking ability to get in behind.\u201d In the 35th minute, Jones would square up his defender once again, skipping past him and producing a low cross to the near post. \u201cI think Alexi was sensing we were transitioning and he could get in behind,\u201d Sampson says of the move for the second goal. \u201cWe covered for his run, and it was a perfect combination of run and cross.\u201d Lalas stole in at the near post and flicked the ball underneath the goalkeeper. The United States now led by two. \u201cI had to pinch myself,\u201d Sampson admits. \u201cI\u2019m sitting next to Clive Charles, my assistant, and I remember that night we are looking at each other thinking: \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019\u201d As the half-time whistle sounded, the two teams displayed a polarizing set of emotions. The US were now on course for qualification, but a startling realization occurred as they departed the field. \u201cI remember coming into the locker room, and typical Tab Ramos, said in his Jersey voice, \u2018You guys do realize if we get one more goal, we win the group?\u2019\u201d Wynalda recalls. \u201cIt was dead silent, and everyone let that sink in.\u201d With the United States now feeling ambitious, Argentina were desperately trying to salvage some pride. Sampson introduced Tab Ramos in place of Klopas, while Passarella summoned Ariel Ortega and Simeone from his bench.

Photograph: Rick Stewart/Getty Images    For Wynalda, the arrival of Simeone represented the conclusion to the pre-match skirmish. As the midfielder entered the field, it was clear that 45 minutes on the bench had done little to calm his tongue. \u201cWhen he came on at half time, he just would not stop [talking],\u201d Wynalda says. \u201cHe was telling us he was going to kill us, and go through us, it was that intimidation factor. If you go back and watch the game, Simeone got the ball and [Thomas] Dooley just took his ass out. Simeone got up, and wanted to start a fight. I ran past him and hit him with my shoulder, and then a few seconds later someone else bumped him. He realized this was a fight, and we weren\u2019t going to back down.\u201d Wynalda admits Simeone did manage to catch him once: \u201cHe hit me so hard I swear to God, I tried to pretend like it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Wynalda would eventually silence Simeone and his team-mates in the 58th minute: \u201cJoe-Max [Moore] and I still argue about it,\u201d Wynalda says of the third goal. \u201cI tell him: if I hadn\u2019t raced in, the goalkeeper would have slapped it out of there.\u201d Receiving the ball wide right, Wynalda drove inside before playing a cute pass in behind the Argentina defence to Moore. \u201cIn my head I was trying to think how do I get into a good spot in case he [Moore] crossed it for me,\u201d Wynalda explains. \u201cMy pass went a little bit further than I had hoped, and Joe realized the goalkeeper had actually come out and he had a chance at scoring. He slid in for a shot, and when I realized the ball was in between the two of us [the goalkeeper and I], there was no way I was going to lose that race.\u201d As Wynalda poked the ball home, the US moved to the top of their group. They had not only outfought Argentina, but also outplayed them. \u201cTo a certain extent Steve took the shackles off,\u201d Lalas says. \u201cHe followed that path that a lot of coaches take, in that he came in after a coach and was able to see what worked and what didn\u2019t. We were a very risk-averse team in the \u201994 World Cup, which I think was the right decision at the time, but I think Steve realized if we were going to improve he had to give us more opportunities to go forward.\u201d After seeing out the game to record a memorable victory, the team were then greeted by a special visitor after the game. \u201cMaradona was there in his box,\u201d Klopas recalls. \u201cHe came down afterwards to talk to us and he congratulated us on our victory. He said we deserved to win, and that was really nice. I\u2019ll always remember that.\u201d Elsewhere, Passarella attempted to save face. After bemoaning his team selection in the post-match press conference, he ultimately handed credit to the US. Argentina were forced to play Brazil in the next round, where they lost on penalties, but the United States had won fans in Paysand\u00fa by beating the Albiceleste. \u201cWe came to Uruguay and beat Argentina, so we earned instant hero status,\u201d Wynalda says. \u201cWe went out that night and we drank quite a bit.\u201d It was a euphoric evening for all connected with the United States. The team would end the tournament in fourth place. It represented an important shift in US Soccer, and is still to this day the country\u2019s best ever finish at a Copa Am\u00e9rica. \u201cTo me, it really demonstrated the difference between the team that played in \u201994 and \u201995 as it was a team playing to win, instead of playing not to lose,\u201d Sampson says. \u201cThat subtle psychology change is what lead to this landmark moment in US Soccer history, and I\u2019ll forever be proud of that.\u201d",
