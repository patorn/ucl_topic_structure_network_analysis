  "body": "Corey Thompson is making a habit out of scoring important tries for Widnes but, in the context of his side\u2019s rapidly declining season, his 38th-minute score during this dramatic contest will surely go down as the most crucial yet. Widnes, trailing 16-0 and seemingly heading for a ninth consecutive Super League defeat, were desperately in need of something before half-time to give them even the faintest of hope against Huddersfield. The pass from the Widnes captain, Kevin Brown, was arguably the more applaudable part of the play, but when Thompson dotted the ball down under pressure, the Vikings seemed to have fresh hope \u2013 and ultimately, fresh impetus for their season. This may not have felt like the most significant game of the weekend given the table-topping battles elsewhere, but in the bigger picture of the fight to avoid the bottom four and a potential relegation battle, this is arguably the most pivotal result of the season so far. Defeat for Widnes would have meant both Huddersfield and Salford closing the gap on the eighth-placed Vikings to just two points. But the 24 unanswered points which laid the platform for Widnes\u2019 first league win since mid-March means they remain four points clear of the chasing pack, and six ahead of a Huddersfield side who now have just seven games left to claw themselves out of the bottom four. \u201cWe\u2019ve only got ourselves to blame,\u201d Paul Anderson, the Huddersfield coach, said. \u201cIf we\u2019d put another score on them at 16-0 we may have put the game to bed, but we got what we deserved.\u201d Widnes had begun to look like a side who had forgotten how to win in the last eight weeks as they tumbled down the Super League, following a start which had seen them sitting top after a win against Wigan over two months ago \u2013 so this was a comeback that could only be described as season-defining. \u201cIt may not have been beautiful, but we\u2019ll take it,\u201d Denis Betts, the Widnes coach, said. \u201cIt was a struggle but the character and spirit of the lads from 16-0 down was superb \u2013 we felt we were the best side. We\u2019ve been speaking about just getting over the line and getting a win, and we\u2019ve turned a corner now.\u201d Widnes would have looked on enviously at Huddersfield\u2019s recent improvement, and after tries from Nathan Mason, Danny Brough and Joe Wardle put the Giants 16-0 up, the result looked to be going to form. The second of those tries epitomised Widnes\u2019 predicament; with Setaimata Sa looking for a quick play-the-ball, there was no Vikings man at dummy-half, allowing Brough to collect the loose ball and race home. \u201cWe made a mess of that try and people can start to look at each other there \u2013 but the word from behind the posts was we knew we were right in the game: we weren\u2019t panicking,\u201d Betts said. How right he was.

Revitalised, Mellor\u2019s second \u2013 a fine piece of individual skill as the young half-back stepped off his left foot and weaved over the line \u2013 pushed the gap out to eight, which always felt vital in a game of such importance. Jermaine McGillvary set up a thrilling finale with a try 10 minutes from time but Widnes held on. As Betts said, it was not pretty \u2013 but the cheers from the Widnes fans at full-time would have no doubt been matched by groans from fans of not only Huddersfield, but most likely fellow bottom-four sides Salford and Hull KR too after a result of huge significance for the remainder of the regular season.
