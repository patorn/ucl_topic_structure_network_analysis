  "body": "The government is considering introducing legislation to close a loophole allowing parents in England to take their children on holidays during term-time, after a ruling by the high court left its school attendance policy in tatters. Friday\u2019s ruling opens the way for parents to take their children out of state schools without permission so long as they have a good record of attendance. But the Department for Education said the issue was \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d. \u201cWe will examine today\u2019s judgment in detail but are clear that children\u2019s attendance at school is non-negotiable so we will now look to change the legislation. We also plan to strengthen statutory guidance to schools and local authorities,\u201d a DfE spokesperson said. Jon Platt, a father from the Isle of Wight, won a landmark decision after challenging the DfE\u2019s rules barring term-time absences for state school pupils in all but \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances. \u201cI am obviously hugely relieved. I know that there was an awful lot riding on this \u2013 not just for me but for hundreds of other parents,\u201d Platt said after the decision was announced. \u201cThis idea that I have to justify to Isle of Wight council what I do with my kids is a nonsense. It\u2019s not ideal, but sometimes it\u2019s necessary and the law does not prevent me from doing so.\u201d  The high court held that parents whose children who attended school \u201cregularly\u201d could be allowed family absences \u2013 a decision that highlighted the gap between the existing law and the DfE\u2019s tougher regulations introduced in 2013 when Michael Gove was education secretary. Platt had challenged the council\u2019s attempt to impose a \u00a3120 penalty for unauthorised absence after he took his daughter to Disney World last year, and was backed by a local magistrates court. The council then appealed to the high court. Platt argued that his daughter\u2019s attendance record of more than 90% met the requirement of section 444 of the Education Act, that parents ensure their children attend school \u201cregularly\u201d. He also argued that the law did not place restrictions on parents taking their children on holiday in school time. The Isle of Wight appealed against the magistrates\u2019 decision, but Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mrs Justice Thirlwall dismissed the legal challenge. The court ruled that the magistrates were entitled to take into account the \u201cwider picture\u201d of the child\u2019s attendance record. \u201cI do not consider it is open to an authority to criminalise every unauthorised holiday by the simple device of alleging that there has been no regular attendance in a period limited to the absence on holiday,\u201d Lloyd Jones said. Daniel Jackson, a solicitor who has represented parents in similar cases, said: \u201cI think it will lead to more parents contesting the fines. Mr Platt has gained a lot of support in what he is doing, his case has been highly publicised and a lot of people who do end up being prosecuted will have a stronger argument now.\u201d The DfE said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the judgment. \u201cThe evidence is clear that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil\u2019s chance of gaining good GCSEs, which has a lasting effect on their life chances. We are confident our policy to reduce school absence is clear and correct,\u201d it said in statement. The ruling will be greeted with enthusiasm by campaigners who have been lobbying against the stricter rules, which removed the leeway previously allowing headteachers to authorise up to two weeks\u2019 term-time holiday a year for pupils with good attendance records. Any changes to legislation would mostly involve a definition of \u201cregular\u201d school attendance, possibly in line with the 90% threshold that the DfE requires from schools overall. The department\u2019s definition of truancy is a persistent absence of 10% of school days. The Local Government Association said the DfE\u2019s blanket ban was not working and was putting a strain on councils that had to enforce it. \u201cThere has to be a sensible solution whereby every family has the option to spend time together when they choose to, rather than tying families to set holiday periods,\u201d the LGA said. \u201cWhile councils fully support the DfE\u2019s stance on every child being in school every day, there are occasions when parental requests should be given individual consideration and a commonsense approach applied.\u201d Julie Robertson, a solicitor who has represented parents who have faced legal action over term-time holidays, said: \u201cHopefully we can now draw a line in the sand and leave magistrates to make decisions on an individual, case-by case-basis. \u201cIt is simply impossible to provide a percentage figure for which level of attendance is considered regular. It is not something you can put a blanket figure on without taking into account the academic record of each individual child.\u201d The DfE\u2019s case was backed by the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents mainly secondary school headteachers. \u201cPupils are expected to attend school as close to 100% of the time as possible and they should not miss school to go on holiday,\u201d said the ASCL\u2019s Malcolm Trobe. \u201cThis is because even short periods of attendance can have a detrimental impact on their education, so consistent attendance is absolutely vital. We are a nation which values education and school attendance is part of that commitment.\u201d In 2015 holidays in term time \u2013 both authorised and unauthorised \u2013 made up 7.5% of absences, a total of 4.1m school days lost. Illness accounted for 60% of annual absences. The DfE\u2019s policy and high court ruling apply only to pupils aged five and over attending state schools in England. The rules do not apply to independent schools, while devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own policies.",
