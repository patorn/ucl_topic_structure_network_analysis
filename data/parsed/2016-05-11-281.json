If Doherty is a new name to you, don\u2019t think you are the only one. Doherty is the player nobody mentions when they talk about the precious, rare group that preceded the class of \u201992. He is, to quote the book\u2019s front cover, \u201cfootball\u2019s lost genius\u201d. Yet there was a time when \u201cDoc\u201d was regarded behind the scenes as so thrillingly exceptional he had the edge on the young Ryan Giggs. Ferguson introduced him in one set of programme notes as \u201cgreased lightning\u201d and the Manchester Evening News talked of a teenage sensation capable of making \u201cthe kind of impact not seen since George Best was given his chance\u201d. Yes, newspapers love those kind of headline-grabbing comparisons, but talk to anyone at Old Trafford from that era and they all say the same. \u201cHe was out of this world,\u201d Gary Neville says. Better than Giggs? The man himself readily accepts he was often in Doherty\u2019s slipstream. \u201cHe could go past people at will,\u201d Giggs says. \u201cHe could ride tackles like you wouldn\u2019t believe. He could go inside, outside, play one-twos, pass and move. You know in The Matrix, where everything clicks together, where it\u2019s all happening quickly, but in the character\u2019s head it\u2019s slow motion? It was a bit like that with Doc.\u201d But there was more to him as well. Doherty wrote poetry. He was obsessed with Bob Dylan \u2013 \u201cas a 16-year-old, I didn\u2019t have a clue who Bob Dylan was,\u201d Giggs says \u2013 and, in the nicest possible way, he arrived from Strabane with his head in the clouds. Doherty was a lost soul in some regards. Others remember him as bohemian, a dreamer, slightly eccentric for the football world. He didn\u2019t gel his hair or bother with designer labels. \u201cThe most amazing football skill,\u201d Ferguson says, \u201cbut happiest with his books, poems and guitar.\u201d Doherty would often sell his tickets for whoever the first team was playing, then go busking in Manchester city centre \u2013 a young footballer, on the verge of playing for England\u2019s biggest club, strumming his guitar, unrecognised, in a baggy Aran jumper outside the Arndale shopping centre. In Manchester\u2019s music scene \u2013 and we are not talking about the Hacienda here \u2013 he was \u201cMcHillbilly\u201d, playing in a short-lived band called the Mad Hatters. What followed is ultimately a story of wasted life and talent. Doherty was on the cusp of Ferguson\u2019s team when he ruptured his cruciate ligament. The injury finished his career and it is the medical treatment at Old Trafford that partly explains why Kay writes how, all these years on, the family \u201cstill feel Adrian was badly let down\u201d. Released from his contract, Doherty drifted out of the game. When the trophies were rolling in at Old Trafford he was trying to find alternative employment, even working for a spell in a chocolates factory in Preston. In April 2000, rather than starring for the European champions, he moved to The Hague for the summer, working for a furniture company on a short-term contract. Then one morning, for reasons that have never been fully established, he slipped into the canal on his way to work. He was in a coma for a month and died on 9\u00a0June, the day before his 27th birthday.     The Manchester United team before the Youth Cup semi-final 1 April 1990.

Photograph: Manchester United/Man Utd via Getty Images    The strange thing, perhaps, since then \u2013 and this is a question the Dohertys would like answering, even just for peace of mind \u2013 is that he has never warranted anything other than the tiniest of mentions (and in the vast majority of cases, absolutely nothing) in the many books written by Ferguson and numerous players from that era. \u201cMaybe awkwardness,\u201d Giggs offers. Yet it is not an entirely satisfactory explanation and, according to Kay, the family \u201calways suspected there was another reason for the silence\u201d, namely that for more than a decade a dispute was rumbling about the standard of care their son received in his four years at the club. Jimmy was not seeking financial gain but he did want, and never received, an apology, as well as some proper answers to their questions. Firstly, the family were troubled about the details of Doherty\u2019s injury, the diagnosis and aftercare, but there were welfare issues that concerned them, too. They had been promised Jimmy would be offered a \u201chome from home\u201d at the club\u2019s \u201cdigs\u201d. Instead, the book describes a culture of intimidation and humiliation featuring \u201cinitiation trials\u201d \u2013 placing apprentices in tumble dryers, kicking balls in their face, stripping them, not to mention more sinister routines \u2013 that, combined with homesickness, left Doherty so disillusioned at one point he rejected the offer of a five-year contract. It was, Kay writes, a \u201cculture that at times lurched between the inane and sinister\u201d and \u201cwhat most people would term abuse\u201d. United have declined to comment but have written to the family saying the club acted \u201cfairly and appropriately\u201d. They now have a rigorous safeguarding policy in place but you will probably have to decide for yourself whether the club should have done more at the time or shown greater empathy towards a grieving family. Jimmy also wrote to the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, whom he imagined would be keen to support the family of a footballer who had died in a tragic accident, and the Football Association. \u201cHe was left with the feeling that United, the PFA and FA closed ranks,\u201d Kay writes (the PFA has told the Guardian it believes United \u201cdid all they could in a compassionate way to respond to the concerns of Adrian\u2019s family\u201d). The author goes on to say that Neville, as club captain, was roped in to help the mediation process. \u201cJimmy\u2019s recollection of that telephone conversation is that Neville, after speaking so fondly and admiringly of Adrian, advised him, in friendly terms, that it would be pointless trying to take on the might of Manchester United.\u201d Everything Jimmy has subsequently encountered from the authorities tells him Neville was probably right but at least now the story of his son\u2019s talent \u2013 together with his other precious gifts \u2013 does not have to be a mystifying secret. Kay has provided the lasting document that maybe not everyone at Old Trafford wanted to read. Doherty\u2019s story has been ignored and overlooked for too long and, in the process, maybe the slurs and innuendo the family have encountered can stop now. Soon after Doherty\u2019s death, it was misreported \u2013 then taken as fact and repeatedly mentioned over the years \u2013 that he had actually fallen into the water in Amsterdam and, once that detail was out there, it spread like spilt milk. \u201cWhat a lot of people don\u2019t realise is that the years from 20 to 26, after he left football, were the happiest of Adrian\u2019s life,\u201d his brother, Gareth, says. \u201cInstead, they see \u2018footballer, released by Manchester United, fell into a canal in Amsterdam\u2019 \u2013 which isn\u2019t true [it was in The Hague] \u2013 and they jump to conclusions.\u201d As a result, there has all been all sorts of gossip about drugs, excessive alcohol, suicide or \u2013 to quote another former team-mate \u2013 the constant suspicion that, being Amsterdam, it might have been \u201cyou know, seedy\u201d. In reality, there was never any evidence of that nature. Nobody will ever know the exact truth but Kay\u2019s theory certainly beats some of the others that have been doing the rounds all these years. \u201cThis wonderful guy,\u201d he writes, \u201cwho happily stumbled through life, ignoring its pitfalls, was daydreaming away, composing his next poem or song, singing away to himself on his way to the station, when he took a fateful wrong step. What sort of person would do something like that? A dreamer, with his head in the clouds, like Adrian Doherty.\u201d Forever Young, published by Quercus, will be released on 19 May",
