  "body": "In a year when we mourn the loss of many national treasures, I reflect with great sadness on the passing of Nobel prize-winning chemist Harry Kroto. Harry was an alumnus of Bolton School, where I was studying when I had the good fortune to hear him accept the Dalton Medal at Manchester University in 1998. His story of scientific discovery and down-to-earth demeanour inspired me to pursue a career in science, but something he said that night has stuck with me even more. He spoke about the value, indeed the necessity, of communicating complex science to public audiences: \u201cScientific discoveries matter much more when they\u2019re communicated simply and well \u2013 if you can\u2019t explain your work to the man in the pub, what\u2019s the point?\u201d Science has lost a great mind, and the public a great science communicator - someone who deserves as many plaudits as the many entertainers we\u2019ve said goodbye to of late.Prateek BuchWoodford Green, Essex \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
