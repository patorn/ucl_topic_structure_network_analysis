Before what is likely to be the most politicised Eurovision in recent memory, 32-year-old jazz singer Jamala said her ballad, 1944, was not only about the deportation of the Crimean Tatar population during the second world war, but the events of the past two years in the peninsula.  Jamala, whose real name is Susana Jamaladynova and is herself a Crimean Tatar, has not been home since shortly after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of the peninsula, but her parents and extended family still live there.             Russia\u2019s entry is the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to win the contestin Stockholm on Saturday, but many in central and eastern Europe are expected to vote tactically to put a different country at the top of the leader board. \u201c[If I win] it will mean that modern European people are not indifferent, and are ready to hear about the pain of other people and are ready to sympathise,\u201d Jamala told the Guardian by phone from the Swedish capital.

Imagine, you\u2019re a creative person, a singer, but you can\u2019t go home for two years. You see your grandfather on Skype who is 90 years old and ill, but you can\u2019t visit him. What am I supposed to do: just sing nice songs and forget about it? Of course I can\u2019t do that.\u201d     Jamala representing Ukraine celebrates as she advances to the grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images    The Eurovision rules ban performances containing \u201clyrics, speeches or gestures of a political or similar nature\u201d.  In 2009, Georgia\u2019s entry, We Don\u2019t Wanna Put In, was deemed to break this rule, with its apparent reference to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Georgia refused to change the entry, meaning it did not compete. Last year, Armenia was asked to modify its entry, Don\u2019t Deny, which was thought to refer to the 1915 genocide. Jamala said she was not worried about the rule. \u201cEvery single word in the song is the truth.\u201d The Russian entrant, Sergei Lazarev, will sing a more standard Eurovision number, entitled You Are the Only One. It contains lyrics such as \u201cthunder and lighting, it\u2019s getting exciting\u201d, and features the singer dancing around the stage flapping a pair of computer-generated wings.    Related: No ticket for Eurovision? Virtual reality could be the answer    Lazarev \u2013 who was formerly one half of a Russian boy band and runs a business that makes cakes and pastries for pets called Poodle-Strudel \u2013 has drawn criticism at home for saying he does not see Crimea as part of Russia. In a 2014 interview with Ukrainian television after Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula, he said: \u201cThis joy that everyone - or the majority - feels that Crimea has returned to us, I don\u2019t share this euphoria,\u201d adding that he had refused to take part in concerts celebrating the annexation. He has also previously spoken out against his country\u2019s climate of homophobia, and told Sweden\u2019s QX magazine earlier this month that he welcomes the support of gay fans. While still popular at home, his words have prompted youth wing of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ruling United Russia party to accuse him of forgetting \u201cwhat country he was born in.\u201d While in much of Europe, Eurovision is seen as a festival of kitsch to laugh both at and with, in parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, the competition is taken seriously. When Dima Bilan won Eurovision for Russia in 2008, he was immediately phoned by the then president, Dmitry Medvedev, offering his congratulations. One of the fiercest rivalries is between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the separatist enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is officially part of Azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic Armenian forces.  Dozens died in a flare-up in violence earlier this year. In the first Eurovision semi-final on Tuesday, the Armenian entrant, Iveta Mukuchyan, was criticised for waving a Karabakh flag. Eurovision relaxed the rules on flag-waving after protests by fans of Jamala, who said they wanted to wave Crimean Tatar flags.

Ukraine\u2019s decision to enter a Crimean singer is likely to prove controversial at a time when most of the world recognises the peninsula as Ukrainian territory but Russia insists there can be no going back on the annexation.   Related: How Eurovision finally cracked America    Many in Crimea welcomed annexation, but most Crimean Tatars were wary of Russia, remembering the 1944 deportation. They were only allowed to return in 1989. In the past two months, the Crimean Tatar community has come under huge pressure from Russia. While some have decided to work with the Russian authorities, many have declared them occupiers.  A number of court cases are under way against Tatar activists, and many more activists have simply disappeared. Just this week, armed police raided the house of Ilmi Umerov, the former mayor of the historic Tatar capital, Bakhchisarai. He will be charged with \u201cextremism\u201d for saying Crimea is part of Ukraine, and could face up to five years in prison.     Jamala performs the song 1944. Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images    Jamala said more than 20 of her acquaintances had disappeared in recent months.  The Crimean Tatar journalist Ayder Muzhdabaev wrote on Facebook: \u201cSing, Jamala! Sing, and win to spite them all. Let the world hear the words of your Crimean Tatar song; let them hear our pain and see our dignity.  \u201cSing for Ilmi Umerov, for our missing and our dead, for our prisoners of conscience and for our whole great people. These bastards will never humiliate us, they will never defeat us.\u201d",
