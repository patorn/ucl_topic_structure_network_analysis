  "body": "The field is the stuff of aid worker dreams, the place where reasonable reminiscing goes to die as another ageing misfit, mercenary or missionary regales you with the time they spent dodging landmines in lower east Mondovia back when that place was really interesting. And the \u201csite visit\u201d is the holy grail of fieldwork; a time to see your hard work putting together that lollipop factory grant pay off. It\u2019s also when those headquarters people get a chance to understand the work that you do; when they\u2019ll ride along to see what good the lollipop manufacturing has done for the people of outer Mondovia, because it\u2019s time to take a look at a country that needs lollipop manufacturing capacity.  Site visits are one of those things you know you need to do, but their success is tough to quantify. Like all good measures of effectiveness, we\u2019ll keep this simple with a \u201cwin/lose\u201d rating for key points during the visit. Before you leave, go ahead and score the reasons for the site visit. Reason 1: Your donor\u2019s aware of a possible audit and has asked that you verify some of the more important sites in your portfolio. The Lollipop Manufacturing Company of Mondovia is pretty high on that list. Win: Put this one in the \u201cwin\u201d column because it means the people who sign your cheques know what it is they pay you to do. Lose: If it turns out there\u2019s actually a really good reason for that audit and the inspector general wants to talk to you about some things.   Related: Five things every aid worker can learn from Game of Thrones    Reason 2: A team from headquarters is here, and they\u2019ve asked to see the lollipop factory, because one of the visitors did something similar in Mondovia before the third civil war, and they\u2019d love to see the progress you\u2019ve made. Win: If the people from home office are senior enough.  Lose: If it\u2019s the same home office backstop that never shuts up about that time she almost married a Sudanese warlord. Reason 3: You\u2019ve been cooped up in residence for months, and thanks to spotty internet you\u2019re not getting your usual fix of Pretty Little Liars, and so it\u2019s time to get out and see the countryside. Win: Score one for getting out of the house. Lose: You watch Pretty Little Liars. Shame. Now that you\u2019re out and about, time to score the visit itself.  If security was against it: Security didn\u2019t recommend the trip, but also didn\u2019t want to tell you it was too dangerous to go, so you went anyway. Now\u2019s your chance to prove to that ex-special forces medic that you know way more about outer Mondovia\u2019s people than he ever could. This one can go a few different ways... Win: Win all around if the trip goes well and everyone makes it back safely. Lose/win/win: You get kidnapped (lose), survive the rescue (win), and Angelina Jolie plays you in the movie that gets picked up and re-broadcast on the Oprah Winfrey Network (huge win). Lose/lose/win: Same scenario, except this time you don\u2019t survive the rescue attempt. It guarantees Angie\u2019s going to star in the film and there\u2019s been talk of it getting picked up by Netflix (you, or your estate, win again). If you can\u2019t find the lollipop factory: No need to worry, it\u2019s not the sort of thing you\u2019ll lose your job over, since competence is not one of the aid worker virtues. Time to pack your bags because there\u2019s a long string of promotions in your future.  Win: You figure out a way to blame the security team. Headquarters people don\u2019t really trust ex-military types anyway. Lose: See above under \u201ckidnap\u201d, since no one wants a script about people kidnapped while they were lost. Unless this is Narnia.   Related: Eleven rules to live by if you want to make it to the top at the UN    If you find the factory: This is it \u2013 time for that aid worker money shot. And a chance for you to figure out once and for all if this visit\u2019s going to be a success. Win: Any pictures of young children leading you around by the hand on your tour of the site.  Lose: Any shot of young children making lollipops at the lollipop factory. \u201cBring your kid so they can work day\u201d is going to be tough to explain to the auditors. Bonus round: Some of the elders have gathered at the lollipop factory to express their gratitude for all the fine work you\u2019ve done. If you can get some pics of elders with lollipops and children? Preferably girls? You\u2019re about to be aid famous and make the blog page! Win: Shots of headquarters personnel intently listening to the local elder explain how many jobs the lollipop factory has brought to his village.  Lose: Turns out said elder is the area pimp and he wants to tell you that his \u201cworkers\u201d like the lollipops very much.
