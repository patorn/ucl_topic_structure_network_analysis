  "body": "Before his last stand as Harlequins\u2019 director of rugby, Conor O\u2019Shea has promised his side will \u201cfire every bullet\u201d in their bid to win the European Challenge Cup final Friday evening. Quins face daunting opponents in the shape of in-form Montpellier but O\u2019Shea, who is leaving the club after six years in charge, expects his players to respond positively to the challenge. Only last Saturday Quins conceded a record 62 points at home to Exeter Chiefs but O\u2019Shea has made eight changes and hopes the return of experienced internationals such as Joe Marler, Adam Jones, James Horwill and Tim Visser will encourage a vigorous response at the Grand Stade de Lyon as they seek to secure not just a trophy but qualification for next season\u2019s Champions\u2019 Cup. The players can certainly expect an emotional pre-match speech from O\u2019Shea, who is moving on to take charge of Italy\u2019s national team.   Related: Italy name Harlequins director of rugby Conor O\u2019Shea as new head coach    The 45-year-old former Ireland full-back admits he would love the club to clinch a fourth trophy in six years and round off his tenure at the Stoop in style. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt I\u2019ll be emotional, no matter what, but I\u2019ll be incredibly proud,\u201d said O\u2019Shea, insisting the Exeter game had not changed his regard for his squad. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let what happened last Saturday sully my thoughts on this group of players, far from it. We\u2019ll see what the emotion is like in the dressing room but there are some pretty hurt people. Sometimes you don\u2019t get an opportunity to right a wrong. We have.\u201d O\u2019Shea is particularly keen for his players to relish this showpiece finale, regardless of the presence of top-quality Springboks such as Bismarck and Jannie du Plessis, Fran\u00e7ois Steyn and Pierre Spies in a Montpellier squad guided by the World Cup-winning coach Jake White. \u201cPeople forget how special it is to be involved in these occasions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to win something you want to be able to remember it and it would be a pretty memorable trophy to pull off. We will fire every bullet we have \u2013 and that includes the bench which is packed full of impact.\u201d Quins, whose players will wear black armbands in memory of prop Seb Adeniran-Olule who died in a road accident this week, have already beaten Montpellier once in the pool stages but some senior England men have been showing understandable signs of weariness at the end of a draining campaign for club and country. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult last couple of months for so many reasons,\u201d acknowledged O\u2019Shea. \u201cThe Six Nations was a killer and we haven\u2019t regained that momentum back. \u201cWe played some brilliant rugby at the start of the season and we have to try to rekindle that going into this match. When I look at the team there are players capable of doing that. Right from the word go, the day we picked the team to play Montpellier at home in the first round, we said we wanted to win it. You are judged on winning trophies, not on finishing a plucky second. I\u2019d prefer us to aim high and fall short than just aim for mediocrity and be happy in the middle. If you look at our track record in France we love going there but this is as big a challenge as we\u2019ve faced.\u201d O\u2019Shea deserves significant credit for the club\u2019s progress on and off the field since his appointment following the Bloodgate debacle of 2009. Leaving the Stoop is going to be a wrench. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done it the right way, we could never be questioned in what we\u2019ve done and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it. The reason we love it is because of the emotional rollercoaster you\u2019re always on. \u201cOne week you\u2019re king of the world, the next week you\u2019re the pits of the world. It makes winning special and losing hard. I hurt for the players after last week and redemption is in the form of a trophy. We want to go out in the right way.\u201d Harlequins M Brow, M Yarde, G Lowe, J Roberts, T Visser; N Evans, D Care (capt), J Marler, J Gray, A Jones, J Horwill, S Twomey, C Robshaw, L Wallace, N Easter.
