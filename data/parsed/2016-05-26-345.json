  "body": "The butcher, the barber, the undertakerOur land is girt by seaThe looker, the quaker, the cocktail shakerSomething young and free We\u2019re luckily, really, to live in a country where nationalism has yet to reach such heights that a rocker can\u2019t irreverently meddle with the national anthem without risking a brick through his window. In his latest single, Advance, Perth singer-songwriter Nicholas Allbrook, replaces the nation-fortifying intentions of Advance Australia Fair with a laconic portrayal of the country\u2019s disinclination for the kind of enthusiastic patriotism commonly seen in other parts of the world. The 28-year-old frontman of psychedelic rock band Pond and former Tame Impala bass player is releasing his second solo album, Pure Gardiya, an intricate mediation on Australian history and national identity.   Related: STRAYA: what should be Australia's national anthem? \u2013 open thread    Allbrook says our national identity has been forced to exist in narrow confines fanatically garrisoned by rightwing media and flag-waving politicians. We\u2019ve become alienated from our Indigenous and British ancestries and nearest neighbours, Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s a society that\u2019s completely adrift from any connection,\u201d he says. \u201cThat comes from us being children of no place, just outsiders to everyone.\u201d            Guardian Australia: How would you describe the Australian national anthem? Nicholas Allbrook: Culture and meaning is always a work-in-progress and never cut and dried. Maybe at the time when it was written it was ambitious and optimistic, but to a modern reviewer \u2013 as you\u2019ve asked me to be \u2013 it\u2019s kind of ignorant and isolationist. It\u2019s insensitively grandiose and pompiose considering all the people that are denied and excluded from it.  \u201cPompiose?\u201d It\u2019s a sweet mashup of pompous and grandiose. I never considered how badly national anthems might date. So few people in Australia even believe in our own national anthem, and that\u2019s why I feel comfortable talking about it, or talking about it negatively. You see sports people and Olympians standing down a lot of the time. They\u2019re not very proud of it. A national anthem should do all the obvious things, such as distil national and human values. It should be a song that truly embodies a culture and people can come together around. But Australia\u2019s traditional custodians are boldly and brutally excluded from our national anthem.     Nicholas Allbrook: \u2018Australia\u2019s traditional custodians are boldly and brutally excluded from our national anthem\u2019. Photograph: Matt Sav/Positive Feedback    I always had a problem with the line describing ourselves as a \u201cyoung\u201d country. Yeah, the oldest continuous civilisation in the world are some of its most incarcerated peoples, and yet are somehow meant to be \u201cyoung and free\u201d.  I can\u2019t speak for anyone else. Maybe people don\u2019t find it offensive. Maybe there are Indigenous people who fought in wars or played in sporting events \u2013 or wherever else the anthem is touted as really important \u2013 [who] have a really strong, genuine connection with it. In that sense I\u2019m really sorry to them if I\u2019ve been a dickhead \u2013 an ignorant millennial, you know? What aspect of the anthem did you want to tease out in doing your \u201ccover version\u201d? A lot of things. I think the apathy and challenging the things that are put up on a pedestal in the national anthem, to highlight the fact most people don\u2019t even really know the words or care about the words \u2013 hence the line: \u201csomething, whatever, young and free\u201d \u2013 and listing all the mundane normal people that are actually part of Australia. It\u2019s not the mythologised Anzac soldiers; it\u2019s startup companies and baristas. When I was writing this, it was that Abbott era; a time in our political history that showed how closed off and wilfully isolated we can be. He was a guy who touted himself as the ultimate Australian, and he was a priest. So much of Australia, or what people put forward as an Australian identity, is a distant and unrelated religion and mindset. We don\u2019t think about the people who are near us, even in Asia. It\u2019s like, just stick your head in the sand and be that really narrow Australian archetype. Has the energy of Australia changed since Malcolm Turnbull came into power? I\u2019m not a political commentator, but I hope it doesn\u2019t sink us further into apathy because Abbott\u2019s left. Turnbull is less outwardly offensive. When you had an actual lizard man as your prime minister, who was hilariously offensive and bad, it made people get up and think a bit more. I hope that doesn\u2019t go the opposite way with a fairly well-spoken, inoffensive, white bread type of chap. Big money seems to be a big problem in the world today and he\u2019s a pretty good emanation of it.   Related: Gareth Liddiard of the Drones: 'It\u2019s time leftwingers grew some balls'    With songs like Taman Shud by the Drones, do you sense there is a new political will in Australian music today? It\u2019s the gaslighting of the majority classes, the non-fucking millionaires. We\u2019ve been taught that we\u2019re stupid and told: \u201cYou don\u2019t understand how the economy works, young man. Don\u2019t even try and have an opinion.\u201d So a lot of people my age are too fucking scared to even say what they mean or what they think, and too scared to be idealistic. We sort of step back and think, \u201cOh shit, I kind of don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, I\u2019ve just got a gut feeling that this isn\u2019t right.\u201d And whenever people speak their mind there\u2019s a fucking 100 people on the internet who say \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d. But hopefully there\u2019s more people like [the Drones frontman] Gareth Liddiard who are just ballsy. In your Griffith Review story Creative Darwinism, you describe your hometown of Perth as a city with \u201cno secret tunnels to romantic fulfilment\u201d. Is there an element of cultural cringe to that? When you live in a place you\u2019re just bred with that. In the same way your friends might meet your mum and thinks she\u2019s the most inspiring person in the world but every time your mum says something to you you\u2019re like, \u201cArggggh\u201d. Embarrassment is also a huge part of it. While we\u2019re subjecting asylum seekers to this gross and inhumane torture, New Zealand \u2013 once again \u2013 steps up to the plate and says, \u201coh we\u2019ll take them, don\u2019t worry\u201d. And still, we won\u2019t let them! That is the biggest cringe I\u2019ve ever done.     Nicholas Allbrook\u2019s second solo album, Pure Gardiya. Photograph: Positive Feedback    Is art always being pushed to the edges in Australia? In Australia we\u2019ve inherited that protestant work ethic. Economical, functional. Romance does not need to be here. Get on with it. Shut up, pinko. We live on lands rich in language, philosophy and art and yet haven\u2019t learned to appreciate those things. Yeah, it\u2019s this tiny bubble of the Australian national identity with not enough room to scratch yourself. It doesn\u2019t even include our own country. It doesn\u2019t include our forefathers like England because, \u201cWe\u2019re fiercely Aussie, you know?\u201d The most Aussie person is \u201cnah, fuck the Poms\u201d and \u201cfuck everyone else\u201d and \u201cfuck all the artists and poofters who get all emotional about stuff\u201d. It\u2019s a society that\u2019s completely adrift from any connection, and so it\u2019s created quite a dark and cynical art form, such as Primitive Calculators or the Birthday Party, and that comes from us being children of no place, just outsiders to everyone.
