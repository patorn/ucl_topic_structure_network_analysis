  "body": "Kate Tyler, managing director of Shake Social Ltd, explains why Moya Vaughan Evans should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:  Moya is Shake Social\u2019s social media manager. Rewind 12 months and we\u2019d just taken on Moya as a bit of an experiment. A recent graduate who\u2019d had no luck in the job market, she had passion but no experience. Yet something shone out at the interview and we took the risk. I\u2019m so glad we did.  Since then, Moya has gone above and beyond all that we\u2019ve asked of her, consistently delivering successes for clients and coming up with creative new ways of approaching social media.  As a digital agency we work with a wide range of organisations, creating online campaigns that deliver results. From exceptional campaigns for our local Rape Crisis Centre, to working with Sport England to encourage women and girls to play more football as part of the City of Football project, Moya has demonstrated creative flair and delivered results.  She now works on some of our most senior accounts, and even met the Chancellor at the end of last year, as part of the Small Business Saturday celebrations at the Treasury.  As a small company, our staff are everything \u2013 it\u2019s great to see young talent developing and having a rising star in our midst raises everyone\u2019s game. She\u2019s not afraid to challenge the status quo and her zeal and expertise have helped our clients flourish too. I\u2019m so proud to be able to say she\u2019s one of the team.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
