No 10 is delighted that Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, and Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan, are attending a summit in London specifically because they have acknowledged the fight against corruption is central to their respective countries\u2019 economic revival. While both leaders have been internally and internationally challenged about the extent to which their verbal commitments are being acted upon, both countries claim that they have devoted huge energy to trying to change the accountability of their administrations. Neither country would directly comment on Cameron\u2019s remarks. Transparency International downgraded Afghanistan on its corruption index in 2015, ranking it 166th, above only Somalia and North Korea.     David Cameron in a meeting with Muhammadu Buhari. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    Ghani, who has been in office since 2014, told an EU delegation in Kabul this week: \u201cThe administrative corruption is still a big challenge. We are firmly committed to fighting it and bringing reforms to ensure good governance and rule of law. \u201cCorruption is a national shame \u2026 we will soon be mounting a national campaign to engage our public in the fight against corruption,\u201d he added, according to Xinhua. Ghani said the government was considering a proposal to establish a specialised anti-corruption justice centre. Last month Franz-Michael Mellbin, the EU\u2019s envoy to Afghanistan, said international donors felt corruption was getting worse. \u201cWhat we need to be convinced about is that steps are being taken, that the country is moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest problem we face is impunity \u2013 the feeling people can get away with it and nothing happens and that needs to change.\u201d   Related: Billions locked in poverty by public sector corruption, report shows    Nigeria, where Buhari was elected president in March 2015, ranked 136th on Transparency International\u2019s index. Although a series of high-profile prosecutions have started, critics say there have been few convictions and there is some evidence that prosecutors are targeting only members of the previous administration. In a speech last week, the justice minister, Abubakar Malami, said corruption was endemic. \u201cA patronage culture has evolved around a powerful elite that is in control of oil revenues and would do anything to maintain the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cWith weak systems of accountability, this has created a situation where corruption has become embedded and accepted as part of life in Nigeria.\u201d Malami added: \u201cIn Nigeria, \u2018grand corruption\u2019 has had a particularly destructive impact with a huge level of illicit asset flight and the illegal transfer of a large proportion of natural resource revenue out of Nigeria to offshore bank accounts or for investment in opaque economies. \u201cBuilding accountability and effective anti-corruption regime, actions and reforms have faced considerable political resistance that has resulted in limited progress, inconsistent policy and practice, complex structural arrangements and a highly politicised environment.\u201d",
