  "body": "Walk around any college campus and Bernie Sanders\u2019 popularity is immediately apparent. Depending on the climate, you\u2019re likely to see Bernie T-shirts or Bernie sweaters or Bernie hats or Bernie scarves. You\u2019re less likely to encounter Hillary Clinton memorabilia. In a setting where students are meant to be rebelling against the status quo, to be wearing berets and hanging Che Guevara posters on their walls, supporting Clinton just isn\u2019t cool.

In April, Sam Koppelman, a 20-year-old government student at Harvard, wrote a letter to the New York Times lamenting that his support for Clinton meant that on campus he \u201cmight as well be Pat Buchanan\u201d. \u201cAt Harvard, admitting that #ImWithHer is nearly tantamount to boasting \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019,\u201d Koppelman wrote.

Photograph: Mark Lorenz for the Guardian    The letter was a coming out of sorts for Koppelman, who told the Guardian that despite having written frequently about politics for his student newspaper until 2012, he stopped this year for fear that it would \u201ccast me as an outsider, cast me as someone who\u2019s more conservative\u201d. \u201cThe 2016 election I\u2019ve been entirely silent, save for a few snarky tweets. And I think that\u2019s definitely emblematic that I\u2019m trying to avoid these conversations,\u201d he said. He made a conscious decision \u2013 until last month \u2013 to not write about his support for Clinton. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Hillary supporter, you\u2019re kind of in this happy medium. Or really an unhappy medium,\u201d Koppelman said, \u201cwhere, by voicing support for Hillary Clinton, you\u2019re at once alienating college Republicans \u2013 who still view her basically as the antichrist \u2013 and you\u2019re alienating Bernie supporters who view her as this remnant of a time when Washington was extremely corrupt.\u201d Koppelman, who grew up in New York City, has spent his time at Harvard engaging in leftwing activism. He is involved in the Black Lives Matter movement and started a group called \u201cHarvard can\u2019t breathe\u201d, after Eric Garner died while being arrested in Staten Island, New York City. Garner\u2019s death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, but a grand jury decided not to indict the officer who arrested him.   Related: Harvard to ban members of single-sex clubs from student leadership roles    Koppelman is still involved with those groups but said he had been conscious not to announce his support for Clinton to his fellow activists. \u201cIf you\u2019re engaged in activism and you\u2019re a part of the campus left, and then you choose to support Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2026 that\u2019s almost a traitorous act,\u201d Koppelman said. Not all Harvard\u2019s students are as reluctant to admit their support for Clinton. As a member of the Harvard for Hillary group, Janet Ho canvassed for Clinton during the New Hampshire primary. Ho, a 19-year-old freshman, is an open advocate for the former secretary of state, but admitted that being a Clinton supporter can be difficult. \u201cDo I feel more challenged by Bernie supporters? Yeah. Do I feel more challenged in general? Yes, I do,\u201d she said. Ho said she felt she had to \u201cjustify\u201d her backing for Clinton to Sanders fans. \u201cThey see the Hillary supporter as someone who doesn\u2019t really want as much equality as they do.

It\u2019s not fair. Why don\u2019t you want equal pay for everyone? Why don\u2019t you want to tax the rich? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 Like: you\u2019re evil.\u201d In March, Clinton won the Massachusetts primary with 50.1% to Sanders\u2019 48.7%, although exit polls show Sanders won 71% of the vote among 18 to 24-year-olds. Sanders\u2019 support among young, passionate voters has seen reporting on the \u201cBernie Bros\u201d phenomenon \u2013 the notion that some Sanders supporters use social media to attack Clinton and her supporters.  Columnists in favour of Clinton have drawn special ire \u2013 sometimes in an aggressive way, sometimes in a sexist way, sometimes both. In January, it prompted Sanders\u2019 \u201crapid response director\u201d, Mike Casca, to call for supporters to respect others in the race. It might explain why some Clinton backers would choose to remain in the closet.  \u201cThere are going to be some people on either side who are going to be really emphatic about what they believe,\u201d said Molly Roberts, a 22-year-old senior studying English who writes a column for the Harvard Crimson, the university\u2019s student newspaper. \u201cAnd then you know, if they\u2019re jerks in the first place maybe they\u2019ll get vitriolic.\u201d      Molly Roberts, 22, a senior at Harvard. Photograph: Mark Lorenz for the Guardian    Roberts has not been cowed by the potential for jerks to become vitriolic. In February, she wrote about her support for Clinton in the Crimson. \u201cThere was maybe one person who said something pretty nasty about it on Facebook and then got some comments that were also nasty,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the prevailing way that the Bernie supporters act.\u201d Koppelman said he was prompted to out himself as a Clinton supporter due to frustration at being unable to be open about it. He wanted to address what he sees as a double standard among some Sanders supporters \u2013 that to support Clinton is to fail to support the fight for equality. \u201cAround the country, low income people, low income minorities are voting for Hillary in vast majorities,\u201d Koppelman said.  \u201cAnd this attitude on college campuses that \u2018if you\u2019re an advocate for social justice issues, you need to be a Bernie supporter\u2019 is really dismissive of those people across the country who are voting for Hillary. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018we know better attitude\u2019 that is so emblematic of the very things Bernie Sanders is campaigning against.\u201d  Sanders won the Indiana primary on Tuesday, but remains well behind Clinton in terms of delegates. It seems likely that Sanders supporters may soon have a decision to make on whether to commit to Clinton, following a primary campaign that has gone on longer and at times been sourer than most would have predicted.    Related: What is Sanders\u2019 route to the Democratic nomination?    \u201cI think Bernie Sanders supporters need to understand that Hillary is not the enemy here,\u201d Ho said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel bad or sad when she\u2019s challenged. It\u2019s more like: \u2018OK, I understand what you\u2019re saying, but you\u2019re wrong.\u2019 At the end of the day, she is still the more viable Democratic candidate. She is fighting for the same issues.\u201d Whatever has gone before, Roberts predicted that come November, there would be a unifying behind whoever is the Democratic nominee. \u201cJust as I know that Bernie supporters, if and when Hillary wins the nomination, will certainly vote for her, and I really hope to campaign for her, I would do the same for Bernie,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take him over any of the Republican candidates any day.\u201d  This article was corrected on 9 May 2016.
