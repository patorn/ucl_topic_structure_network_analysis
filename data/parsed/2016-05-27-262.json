According to Disability Rights UK, a national organisation of disabled people, they are \u201cthe route to achieving independent living based on the social model of disability\u201d. Disabled and older people and others with support needs may therefore have been confused to read academic and activist Peter Beresford\u2019s recent piece on personal budgets. His piece was sparked by the recent National Audit Office (NAO) report into personalised commissioning of social care and a subsequent hearing of the Commons public accounts committee (PAC). While Beresford is convinced of the policy\u2019s failure, that view is evidently not universal. In a direct response to his article, disability rights campaigner and peer Jane Campbell tweeted: \u201cPBs are a force for good \u2013 it\u2019s lack of funding and peer support systems that don\u2019t work.\u201d     Personal budgets don't work? https://t.co/C3zvzQv9Jq PBs are a force for good- its lack of funding and peer support systems that don't work\u2014 Baroness J Campbell (@BnsJaneCampbell) May 5, 2016    What is a personal budget? Disabilty Rights UK offers this definition: \u201cA personal budget is an agreed amount of money that is allocated to you personally by your local council following an assessment of your care and support needs. This is support that you decide and control, in other words you control the money for your care and support \u2026\u201d   Related: Personal budgets don't work. So why are we ignoring the evidence?    This provides us with a view of what personal budgets are supposed to achieve. At their heart, they are intended to bring about a very different kind of relationship between people who look to the state for help and support and the state itself. They should create a new partnership based on transparency and empower people.  The statutory guidance provided to local authorities is categoric on this point:  It is vital that the process used to establish the personal budget is transparent so that people are clear how their budget was calculated, and the method used is robust so that people have confidence that the personal budget allocation is correct and therefore sufficient to meet their care and support needs. However the person chooses to have their needs met, whether by direct payment, by the provision of local authority-arranged or directly provided care and support, or third-party provision, or a mix of these, there should be no constraint on how the needs are met.  The novelty here is not the allocation of resources to individuals, as all non-universal public services (and even some we think of as universal, such as the NHS) already have mechanisms in place for allocating resources to individuals. The real game-changer is that for the first time, government is openly saying that sufficient money should be allocated to each person, and that this should be done using a simple set of publicly understood rules. This is so people themselves can understand, use and ultimately, if they need to, challenge the amount they have been awarded. Seen in this way, personal budgets and austerity make very uncomfortable bedfellows. Beresford dismisses the innovation, insisting there is no need for such bureaucracy and jumps from the reasonable conclusion of the NAO that \u201cthe Department of Health needs to gain a better understanding of the different ways to commission personalised services\u201d to an assertion that we have known what works for 20 years: more direct payments and more money. And he cites work by my organisation, In Control, to support his view. This work is the Poet (personal outcomes evaluation tool) survey. Its third edition, data from which featured heavily in the NAO study, describes the experiences of 2,679 personal budget holders. It explores which groups report better outcomes across a range of 15 different areas of life, including dignity in support, quality of life and independence. Significantly, those most likely to report positive impacts in all 15 areas were people who felt their views were fully listened to when the amount of the budget was set and who felt their views were fully included when their support plan was written. The implementation of personal budgets has coincided with unprecedented cuts to local authority budgets, which has led to substantially reduced spending on care and support. It would be hard to conceive of a tougher stress test for any new social policy. However, it is unhelpful to attack both as though they were one and the same.   Related: Department of Health does not know if personal budgets help service users, report finds    What ultimately matters is whether people are getting enough money to live good, active lives with the support they themselves have shaped. Implementing personal budgets as intended provides just this opportunity. The Poet work is providing us with a growing data set that checks whether they are being implemented effectively and are achieving their ambitions, or whether they are being frustrated by cuts. Speaking at the PAC hearing, an NAO director said: \u201cWe would like to see the number of authorities taking part [in the Poet survey] much extended and consistency over time. It would be useful to know whether the [health] department has plans to try to encourage more to take part.\u201d So, rather than ask why we are implementing personal budgets, perhaps a better question is how are we implementing them. To not implement well, or to get rid of personal budgets, would mean not telling people what level of help and support they can reasonably expect \u2013 and ultimately deny them the right to control their own support and their own lives.
