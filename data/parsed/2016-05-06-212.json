In reality, student life can give your confidence a kicking \u2013 whether you\u2019re up against seemingly impossible deadlines, stressing about how you\u2019ll pay your rent or paralysed by existential angst about what you\u2019re going to do with your life.  The usual rules apply for maintaining a base level of wellbeing: make sure that you get enough sleep, eat well, and get outside regularly (rather than festering in your room or the library). But there are lots of other ways to give yourself a confidence boost in times of crisis.  1. Take an academic approach to problems When it comes to dealing with a crisis of confidence, try employing the same skills that you use for your studies, recommends Katie Finnimore, mentoring coordinator at the University of Essex.    Related: How to stay positive and manage anxiety during exam season    \u201cCreate a mind-map of your concerns,\u201d she says. \u201cThis can help to clear your mind and identify where your lack of confidence is coming from. Get a big piece of paper and some felt tips and get it off your mind as you write. Don\u2019t try to edit your thoughts; just get them onto the paper, however small or daft they might seem. This will help your subconscious to identify your true feelings.\u201d Anoushka Bonwick, projects and relationships officer at Student Minds, agrees. She says approaching challenges as a series of small steps can be helpful. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to think of passing an exam,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a very big thing to do and it can be intangible and daunting.  \u201cInstead, break it down into a series of achievable goals: think \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got an exam, so that means I need to revise. What would a good day\u2019s worth of revision look like?\u2019 \u2013 and do that. This works for all kinds of issues.\u201d  2. Create the social life you want Don\u2019t feel pressured to conform to the stereotype of spending all your free time staring into the bottom of a pint glass (regardless of what your housemates and friends are up to). If the party lifestyle isn\u2019t your thing, try finding a new social landscape.  \u201cThere are a lot of students who aren\u2019t into going out all the time and they are in much a bigger group than they might think,\u201d says Bonwick. \u201cSocieties and clubs are a great way to meet new people and find things to do that aren\u2019t just about drinking culture.  \u201cYou know yourself best. If you know you don\u2019t enjoy clubbing, for example, ask yourself what you can do that will be fun and enjoyable.\u201d  3. Get a mentor When you\u2019re feeling like you can\u2019t manage, it\u2019s helpful to remember that others have been in the same position \u2013 and survived. Many universities offer access to mentors, who focus on topics varying from emotional support to career development. Therese Reinheimer-Jones, head of student engagement and enhancement at Kingston University, says: \u201cCurrent students can play a vital part in welcoming new students and sharing their own experiences. This helps to reassure them that they are not alone and that many before them have felt exactly as they do at the start of this new chapter in their lives.\u201d Liz Guyar-Brown, senior employer and internships manager at the University of Essex, also highlights the benefits of the process: \u201cWe bring in alumni role models who come to talk to students about their career paths and the twists and turns within them. It\u2019s really helpful for students to see what people have gone on to do and how they have coped with life outside of university.\u201d   Related: Eight things students should do when they make a mistake    4. Make the most of university services Your university will offer support in managing the nitty-gritty of day-to-day life, whether the issue is getting a new room or sorting out your council tax exemption. So if you find yourself swamped with life admin, try student services.  Anoushka Bonwick says: \u201cPeople don\u2019t always think about student services, but they offer guidance on all kinds of problems you might face at university, like money troubles and housing, and offer very practical solutions.\u201d  Katie Finnimore adds: \u201cIf you\u2019re worrying about the future, you can visit your careers centre for personalised and confidential information, whether you have no idea where to start or are preparing for the final stage of the interview process. You should also speak to your tutor or a lecturer you get on well with for ideas that are specific to your sector or course; they might have great contacts who can help.\u201d 5. Share your problems When you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it\u2019s easy to hide away. But the simple act of sharing your worries with peers can make a world of difference. \u201cReach out to friends and fellow students, because they will be going through the same things,\u201d says Bonwick. \u201cThe key to coping with the difficulties of university is to talk about them. You are surrounded by people who can relate to you and what you are going through, so don\u2019t suffer in silence.\u201d  \u201cAbove all, be kind to yourself,\u201d says Finnimore. \u201cRelease some of the pressure you\u2019ve put on yourself. We\u2019re usually our own worst critics. Congratulate yourself for every action you take; success is built from many little achievements and your confidence will grow with each step.\u201d Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents \u2013 and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter",
