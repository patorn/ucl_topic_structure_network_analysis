  "body": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez has predicted a \u201cgreat future\u201d for Newcastle United after agreeing to remain in charge of the Championship club next season and revealing that \u201clove\u201d played a pivotal role in persuading him to stay. \u201cThe love I could feel from the fans was a big influence in my decision,\u201d said the former Champions League winner, who started the season just ended as manager of Real Madrid. \u201cThis is a huge club and I wanted to be part of the great future I can see for Newcastle United. I\u2019m convinced we can go up next season, stay in the Premier League for a long time and win trophies. This is a massive club and I want to stay part of it.\u201d Ben\u00edtez\u2019s refusal to activate the break clause in the three-year contract he signed when he succeeded Steve McClaren in March has not only startled large swathes of the football world but represents a major coup for Mike Ashley, the Newcastle owner, and Lee Charnley, the club\u2019s managing director.   Related: Newcastle: seven things Rafael Ben\u00edtez needs to address in the Championship    Ashley and Charnley have shredded their former, failed, management model and offered the Spaniard carte blanche to run the club his way while also furnishing him with a healthy budget. Ben\u00edtez insisted on the insertion of a series of written guarantees in his revamped contract and will exercise full autonomy over, critically, recruitment as well as assorted other spheres including the academy and a re-modelling of the training ground. Pre-agreed spending plans for the next two transfer windows are detailed in his new contract and the 56-year-old has already drawn up a list of transfer targets. Equally significantly a man who hopes to be challenging for Europe during the 2017-18 season, has assurances that no player he wants to keep will be sold. \u201cWe can keep every player we want, if I don\u2019t want to sell a player I don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez who, despite presiding over a six-game unbeaten run at the end of the season, narrowly failed to avert relegation. \u201cWe can also still bring in new players while keeping all the ones we want. How much money we have is private, but we can buy players.\u201d \u201cI have responsibility for football business and the most important things is I have assurances that we will have a strong, winning, team. If I\u2019m here it is because I\u2019m sure we can get promoted, because I\u2019m sure Newcastle can get back where we belong. My relationship with Lee Charnley is really good and, if I ask for something, he will try to help me.\u201d He acknowledged it would have been very hard to walk away after 52,000 fans spent 90 minutes imploring him to stay following a 5-1 win against Spurs on the season\u2019s final Sunday. \u201cThe first thing for me was the fans, the stature of the club and the future. Also my family is in England and I wanted to stay here.\u201d   Related: Andros Townsend says Rafael Ben\u00edtez can get Newcastle \u2018up and challenging\u2019    Indeed his Wirral based wife and two daughters were so overwhelmed by the outpouring of affection from Newcastle fans they told him he would be a fool to turn his back on Tyneside and Ben\u00edtez acknowledges his decision is partly an \u201cemotional\u201d one. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m older that I\u2019m more emotional now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the last game [against Spurs] it would have been very difficult to walk away. It was amazing. I want to repay the fans.\u201d We need to be back where we belong.\u201d In order to stay he rejected \u201csome big money offers\u201d but, having won promotions with Extramadura and Tenerife early in his career he remains unfazed by the prospect of the Championship. \u201cI have the reputation, Ive won trophies,\u2019 he said. \u201cBut I need a project now. The time if right for me to have a challenge, a project. We will have to work hard and prepare for every game like it\u2019s a cup final but I have a passion for coaching and I\u2019m quite excited about the Championship. \u201cSome players have already told me they are quite happy to stay next season because they can see the size of the club and that next year can be a great year if we get promoted.\u201d",
