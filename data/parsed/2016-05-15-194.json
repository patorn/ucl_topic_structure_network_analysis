Laughter track or not? On one hand, such tracks risk patronising you, and few things are less chortlingly funny as being made to feel stupid. On the other, you might in their absence miss a pointer, and also feel stupid. My, but it\u2019s a dilemma. It depends \u2013 my considered opinion, after spending frankly too long worrying at this \u2013 on the audience. Very early on in Upstart Crow, a collaborative Ben Elton-William Shakespeare vehicle for the hopelessly thick and untalented David Mitchell, a member of the studio audience reacted to Liza Tarbuck just saying something in an accent, with her titty-dumplings to the fore with the kind of prolonged loud screeching fit that you or I could only hope to achieve while dousing our genitals in hydrochloric acid. My heart sank. But soon it actually began to get funny, sometimes very. The audience member had obviously been led out by an intern with the promise of a cup of tea and perhaps, actually it\u2019s to be hoped, a reassuring whisper of \u201cyou\u2019re not clever enough for this, dear\u201d. By the end, this mashup of Will\u2019s artistic frustrations in an England seething with stupidity, and as relevant to today as to 1584, had become a delight, to the extent the audience was anticipating the gags. Of a fiendishly cunning plot to frustrate young love, in which it had become necessary to procure a play-dead potion, Mitchell\u2019s brimming \u201cI can\u2019t see how it can possibly go wrong\u201d had much of the hubristic glee in seeing it coming of a Mainwaring, a Hancock. Inevitable parallels \u2013 there was much God\u2019s bodikins! and gut-porridge stuff \u2013 will be drawn with Blackadder, although perhaps someone could tell me why that\u2019s in any conceivable way a bad thing. But Mr Elton has (almost) wholly redeemed himself for crimes against David Haig in the relentlessly smile-free elf\u2019n\u2019safety trudge that was 2013\u2019s The Wright Way, and it\u2019s nice to see he\u2019s got his brain back. And I do like Spencer Jones as Kempe, played as Ricky Gervais as David Brent \u2013 way too knowingly see-what-I-did-there, but that\u2019s how Ben rolls. Mum had no laughter track, but that wasn\u2019t the singular difference about this remarkable comedy. The fact that the glorious Lesley Manville hasn\u2019t played more comedy was the thing. An utter natural, she\u2019s so far been constrained by having to win seemingly endless awards in bittersweet Mike Leigh films, as if there\u2019s any other kind, but is now apparently freed up to slum it. Slum on, say I.     \u2018It\u2019s Butterflies for yet another generation, and as delightful\u2019: Lesley Manville and Peter Mullan in Mum. Photograph: BBC/Big Talk Productions/Mark Johnson    It\u2019s Butterflies for yet another generation, and as delightful. Again, a subtle mother \u2013 in this case a sudden widow\u2013 is the sane fulcrum around which certain fine madnesses, ranging from the silly to the grotesque to the heartbroken, revolve and tilt. It\u2019s a rather brave piece of engineering by BBC2 schedulers, gambling that the Friday night 10pm slot might attract an audience of wise young drunks, as well it might. Manville is perfectly complemented by Peter Mullan, playing against type as seldom before \u2013 awkward, stuttery, shrinking, though I\u2019d still never want to bat away his accent in a dark alley, and I\u2019m bloody Scottish. Elsewhere, it\u2019s a dead heat for acting honours between Lisa McGrillis, as the son\u2019s exuberantly gauche girlfriend, and Dorothy Atkinson as the haughty sister-in-law, (\u201cSo what stopped you getting a pond in the end? Did you just realise it was\u2026tacky?). Two absolute stock comedy stereotypes, but seldom done better, and writer Stefan Golaszewski (Him and Her) somehow raises everything to a sharper level. Perhaps I should stop giving too much of a rat\u2019s ass over canned laughter, then, and simply celebrate the fact that there have arrived two genuine hits at the same time, and on the same channel.     Maggie Siff as Wendy Rhoades battles with the boys in Billions. Photograph: JoJo Whilden/Sky TV    Over on Sky Atlantic, the grand news is that we have yet another big fat belter to hold on to, should our grip on Thrones ever falter. Billions is magnificently unforgiving in what it asks of us, which is essentially to understand the arcaneries of hedge-fund management, a term almost interchangeable with fraud on a macro scale. It\u2019s full of fast sentences such as \u201cOne of my grunts riding the Midas spotted a days-long buy spike\u201d (but then again so, pretty much, is Thrones; it could almost be Daenerys bemoaning another wayward dragon).    We\u2019re not, not quite, back in 1584, but still\u2026 so far it\u2019s a game for the boys    Fortunately for the financially cretinous, among whom I am exceptionally proud to number myself, there\u2019s also a simply ripsnorting human drama being played out before us. Paul Giamatti (Sideways) plays the DA, and plays it like a meaner keener Toby from the West Wing; Damian Lewis, last seen as Wolf Hall\u2019s Loin King, is the insanely charming, kind, dynamically corrupt greedbucket on whom the DA, under vaulting media pressure to jail most of Wall Street, has fastened his fangs. The trap has been baited, the bait taken, and the stage is now set for one humongous pissing contest. I use the gender-specific deliberately: for, so far, women don\u2019t get that much of a look-in. We\u2019re not, not quite, back in 1584, when Mitchell/Shakey could sternly remind a protege, \u201cBut Kate, it is illegal for girls to do anything interesting\u2026\u201d and Maggie Siff as the DA\u2019s wife Wendy Rhoades does get some decent lines, but still\u2026 so far it\u2019s a game for the boys, who would all seem to manage machiavellian venality so very much better. And I\u2019m tempted to also say, so far, that it doesn\u2019t really matter, so finely honed are both script and performances. If any show on earth is going to make you feel sorry for those poor dears who pull down a mere $7.2m a year, to the extent that you have to stay your happy hand from dashing off a cheque then and there, this is it.     \u2018Actually bearable when you see him\u2019: Robert Peston on Sunday. Photograph: ITV    ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday was a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s not (and perhaps wisely) going absolutely head to head with Marr on BBC1, airing an hour later (though now clashing, infuriatingly, with Nicky Campbell\u2019s The Big Questions, which I love, if guiltily, for its ability to showcase God- and Allah-botherers making rampant pig\u2019s unmentionables of themselves.) Robert Peston is actually bearable when you see him, rather than just having him hector you unintelligibly from the radio. By contrast, his chief guest was George Osborne, by some accounts a decent and human and very funny cove. Unfortunately for George, the more he tries to estuarise his voice, the more he dresses down and slumps, all tieless and chummy, the more precisely do his features resemble, with uncanny punchability, those of a posh boy sneering at us.",
