  "body": "It\u2019s lunchtime in a London park on the warmest day of the year, so naturally Patrick Marber has ordered porridge for breakfast. He sits in the sun with the tub of hot gruel placed next to his e-cigarette. His shoulders are hunched as though he\u2019s chilled to the bone or braced for invisible storms. Who cares what time it is? Who cares what season? He wants what he wants and he brings the weather with him. What an iconoclastic career Marber has had, which is another way of saying that it\u2019s been confounding, erratic and prone to bouts of self-sabotage. We\u2019ve known him as a spluttering clown, a mainstay of BBC\u2019s The Day Today and as a respected man of letters, the author of Closer, and, for a period of five years, we didn\u2019t know him at all when he sat marooned at his desk and \u201ccouldn\u2019t write a sod\u201d. He\u2019s switched hats, lost his way and then stumbled on it again. I\u2019d like to hail this, his third act, as a happy ending of sorts, but that would be too easy, it doesn\u2019t fit with his nature. \u201cCareful,\u201d he cautions. \u201cThere\u2019s always a crisis lurking.\u201d     Strindberg in England \u2026 Helen George and Richard Flood in rehearsals for Marber\u2019s After Miss Julie. Photograph: Nobby Clark    The good news is that, at 51, the dramatist is back and writing again. His latest play, The Red Lion, won heartening reviews at the National Theatre last summer. He\u2019s scripting an adaptation of a Michael Cunningham story (By Nightfall); he\u2019s poised to direct a revival he can\u2019t talk about yet (\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been announced, which is bloody annoying\u201d). Then there is the matter of After Miss Julie, overhauled from the Strindberg and updated to postwar England, which is poised to roll out through the regions.  Marber wrote the thing 20 years ago and says he\u2019s content to maintain a supportive interest, resist the temptation to fiddle; the play seems to work well enough as it is. Then he spoons more porridge and admits that, besides, he was never a fan of the Strindberg original: \u201cIt goes on and on.\u201d He adds that this isn\u2019t unusual. \u201cAlmost every play is 10, 15 minutes too long.\u201d A rueful grimace. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t be saying this.\u201d The trouble is that Marber started in standup and still subscribes to its ethos. Hit the audience hard and then get off the stage quick before the crowd gets too rowdy. \u201cI have the comedian\u2019s fear of bottles flying. I\u2019ve never been bottled off, but I have had things thrown at me. Bag of crisps. And there\u2019s still a part of me, when I sit in an audience, that thinks people are going to start heckling the play.\u201d He was a moneyed middle-class boy. His initial plan was to become a revered novelist. I\u2019m wondering how he first stumbled on to the open-mic circuit. \u201cWell, I was a bit hair-shirt about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d been to a posh school [Cranleigh] and then a posh university [Oxford]. And I wanted to do something where none of that privilege was of use to me at all. I\u2019d been to the Comedy Store, and I loved the terror of it and the way the best comedians could control the crowd. What confidence that would give you, if you could somehow survive. The first time I did it I lasted a minute.\u201d     A London-set La Ronde \u2026 Julia Roberts and Jude Law in the 2004 film Closer. Photograph: Allstar/Columbia    I first became aware of him on The Day Today, supporting Chris Morris and Steve Coogan. He played Chapman Baxter, the wall-eyed serial killer with an Elvis fixation, and Peter O\u2019Hanraha-hanrahan, the hapless reporter who \u201closes the news\u201d. Along the way he helped devise the character of Alan Partridge and farmed the man out to his own TV series. He looks back on his collaboration with Coogan as a life-changing moment. \u201cWe got close very quickly, at a point where we were at a crossroads. We were both a bit depressed, not knowing where to go next. Steve needed an organising force and I could be that. I thought he was really talented and really unfocused. I knew how to help him and that was a good feeling. I saw him the other day actually. We talk about the old days with great weepy fondness.\u201d Coogan once told me that the educated, cerebral Marber helped \u201cstop him becoming Alan Partridge for real\u201d. But the association cut both ways. \u201cMy performing was good up to a point,\u201d Marber explains. \u201cBut when you encounter someone like Steve, who\u2019s touched with genius, you think, \u2018Well, I\u2019m never going to be that good. But maybe I can be really good at writing instead.\u2019\u201d     Slamming the wasps from the pure apple of truth \u2026 The Day Today, with, from left, Chris Morris, David Schneider, Patrick Marber, Rebecca Front, Doon Mackichan and Steve Coogan. Photograph: BBC    Perhaps, in hindsight, the transition was too easy. His first play, Dealer\u2019s Choice, sparked; the second, Closer, exploded. A London-set La Ronde of sexual intrigue, it mined the darkest recesses of Marber\u2019s wild youth and psyche and established him as one of the vivid, unflinching dramatists of his generation. He bagged an Oscar-nomination for adapting Notes on a Scandal, rustled up a couple more playscripts and then hit the wall. Marber partly blames Sussex, where he had moved with his wife and two kids. Mostly, he blames himself. He thought he could write anywhere and it turned out he could not. He says, \u201cWe were in debt. I was depressed. And it was awful. It was shit.\u201d    I was never bottled off \u2013 but I did get crisp packets thrown at me    So he sat at his desk and stared at the screen for five years. He accepted screenplay commissions, then had to hand back the cash. \u201cAnd all the while your stock\u2019s going down. I thought I was on a blacklist and I probably was. I was a serial refuser. A serial non-deliverer.\u201d By now he\u2019s polished off the porridge and moved to the e-cigarette. He used to smoke 25 fags a day. Now he vapes, which he likes. \u201cIt\u2019s vulgar but it\u2019s good. You get the same lovely tap at the back of the throat.\u201d Today he\u2019s safely back in London, still burned by the experience, taking it one step at a time. The Red Lion, thank heavens, marked a redemption of sorts, summoning up the urgent tale of a young football star torn between the attentions of a decent, dogged kitman and a corrupt, wheedling manager. Ostensibly, The Red Lion was prompted by Marber\u2019s own Sussex sideline as a director of the community-owned Lewes FC. But I suspect it\u2019s about his creative struggles as well. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d says Marber. \u201cI\u2019m the boy in the play but I\u2019m also the conflicting forces. I\u2019m the bully and I\u2019m the nurturer. So it\u2019s about how you manage whatever talent you have. And those two forces are the voices in my head. And I think you need both. Or at least I think that I do.\u201d The trick, he concludes, is to be less hard on himself. Marber points out that for years he was unable to put dialogue on the page. Now he has learned to cut himself some more slack. He says:\u201cIf I get anything out, producing anything, no matter whether it\u2019s good or not, I allow myself a little pat on the back.\u201d Sometimes the work itself is its own reward. Everything else is a bonus, the honey on his oats.  \u2022 After Miss Julie is at the Theatre Royal Bath, 24-28 May. Box office: 01225 448844. Then touring to Brighton, Richmond and Milton Keynes.",
