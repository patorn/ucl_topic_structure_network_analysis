  "body": "\u201cI wonder if you would consider coming to my house sometimes to sleep with me\u2026 I mean we\u2019re both alone. We\u2019ve been by ourselves for too long. For years. I\u2019m lonely. I think you might be too. I wonder if you would come and sleep in the night with me. And talk.\u201d It\u2019s May \u2013 \u201can evening in May just before full dark\u201d \u2013 and widow Addie Moore is visiting\u00a0her neighbour Louis Waters, a widower. They have known each other for\u00a0years, but they don\u2019t really know each other, until Louis agrees to Addie\u2019s request, and their lives expand with happiness. The late Kent Haruf\u2019s final novel Our Souls at Night is set, as were his previous books, in the \u201clittle dirt-blown\u201d Colorado town of Holt. It\u2019s short \u2013 less than 200 pages. The language is straightforward and stripped back, calm and unassuming. And it all combines to make a novel which, like Louis and Addie\u2019s relationship does for them, warms and expands the heart. At first, Louis is diffident about Addie\u2019s plan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can be equal to you\u2026 In courage, he said. Willingness to risk.\u201d He comes around the back of her house on Cedar Street to make sure the neighbours don\u2019t see, his pyjamas and toothbrush in a paper bag. But Addie, at 70,\u00a0isn\u2019t worried about what the town thinks, and soon Louis isn\u2019t either. \u201cI was feeling more interested in this than I\u2019d felt about anything for a long time,\u201d he says, and they spend their nights learning everything they can about each other. The affair Louis had, and how he came back to his family. The death of Addie\u2019s daughter. How their spouses died. Who their children are. Sharing their nights isn\u2019t about sex, although it does become so, a little. \u201cIt\u2019s some kind of decision to be free. Even at our ages,\u201d says Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s just two old people talking in the dark,\u201d says Addie. The town watches them, and approves or disapproves, depending. Addie\u2019s sad, lonely six-year-old grandson comes to stay, abandoned by his haphazardly unkind parents. She and Louis mend him \u2013 heal would be too affected a word for Haruf to\u00a0use \u2013 with a dog and\u00a0a baseball mitt and a camping trip. Unkindness pushes them apart, but the sentiment that lingers most, on finishing this beautiful, tranquil, tender novel, is contentment. \u201cMakes me think there might be hope for somebody else in this life,\u201d Addie and Louis are told by an old farmer. \u201cAddie patted his hand. Thank you. It is a hopeful thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Our Souls at Night is published by Picador (\u00a37.99). Click here to order it for \u00a35.99",
