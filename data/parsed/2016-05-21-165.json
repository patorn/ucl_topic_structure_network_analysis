  "body": "This article is the subject of a legal complaint made on behalf of Royal Caribbean International When the gargantuan Harmony of the Seas slips out of Southampton docks on Sunday afternoon on its first commercial voyage, the 16-deck-high floating city will switch off its auxiliary engines, fire up its three giant diesels and head to the open sea. But while the 6,780 passengers and 2,100 crew on the largest cruise ship in the world wave goodbye to England, many people left behind in Southampton say they will be glad to see it go. They complain that air pollution from such nautical behemoths is getting worse every year as cruising becomes the fastest growing sector of the mass tourism industry and as ships get bigger and bigger. The Harmony, owned by Royal Caribbean, has two four-storey high 16-cylinder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 engines which would, at full power, each burn 1,377 US gallons of fuel an hour, or about 66,000 gallons a day of some of the most polluting diesel fuel in the world.   Related: Air pollution rising at an 'alarming rate' in world's cities    In port, and close to US and some European coasts, the Harmony must burn low sulphur fuel or use abatement technologies. But, says Colin MacQueen, who lives around 400 yards from the docks and is a member of new environment group Southampton Clean Air, the fumes from cruise liners and bulk cargo ships are \u201cdefinitely\u201d contributing to Southampton\u2019s highly polluted air. \u201cWe can smell, see and taste it. These ships are like blocks of flats. Sometimes there are five or more in the docks at the same time. The wind blows their pollution directly into the city and as far we can tell, there is no monitoring of their pollution. We are pushing for them to use shore power but they have resisted.\u201d \u201cThe liners pollute, but the road traffic that they and the cargo ships generate is also huge,\u201d he adds.  Royal Caribbean, the US owners of the Harmony of the Seas, said that the latest and most efficient pollution control systems were used and that the ship met all legal requirements.  Industry body Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) added that companies had \u201cinvested significantly over the last decade to develop new technologies to help reduce air emissions\u201d.           World\u2019s largest cruise ship arrives in Southampton on Tuesday    But marine pollution analysts in Germany and Brussels said that such a large ship would probably burn at least 150 tonnes of fuel a day, and emit more sulphur than several million cars, more NO2 gas than all the traffic passing through a medium-sized town and more particulate emissions than thousands of London buses. According to leading independent German pollution analyst Axel Friedrich, a single large cruise ship will emit over five tonnes of NOX emissions, and 450kg of ultra fine particles a day.  Bill Hemmings, marine expert at Brussels-based Transport and Environment group said: \u201cThese ships burn as much fuel as whole towns. They use a lot more power than container ships and even when they burn low sulphur fuel, it\u2019s 100 times worse than road diesel.\u201d \u201cAir pollution from international shipping accounts for around 50,000 premature deaths per year in Europe alone, at an annual cost to society of more than \u20ac58bn [ $65bn],\u201d says the group on its website.   Cruise ship emissions   Daniel Rieger, a transport officer at German environment group Nabu, said: \u201cCruise companies create a picture of being a bright, clean and environmentally friendly tourism sector. But the opposite is true. One cruise ship emits as many air pollutants as five million cars going the same distance because these ships use heavy fuel that on land would have to be disposed of as hazardous waste.\u201d Nabu has measured pollution in large German ports and found high concentrations of pollutants. \u201cHeavy fuel oil can contain 3,500 times more sulphur than diesel that is used for land traffic vehicles. Ships do not have exhaust abatement technologies like particulate filters that are standard on passenger cars and lorries,\u201d says Rieger.

We are now seeing more, bigger liners but also very large bulk cargo ships.\u201d According to CLIA, the cruise ship industry is now one of the fastest growing sectors in the mass tourism market, with 24 million passengers expected to sail in 2016, compared to 15 million in 2006 and just 1.4 million in 1980. \u201cThe industry shows no signs of slowing down. It generated $119.9bn (\u00a383bn) in total output worldwide in 2015, supporting 939,232 full-time equivalent jobs,\u201d said a spokesman.  \u201cThe luxury sector is seeing the most amazing growth that it has ever seen in its history,\u201d said Larry Pimentel, president of Azamara club cruises.  \u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2016. An earlier version said the Harmony of the Seas had three 16-cylinder engines which, if running at full power, would burn 96,000 US gallons of fuel a day. It has two such engines which together would burn about 66,000 US gallons of fuel a day if running at full power, and is understood to have four 12 cylinder engines. The article also said the ship must burn low-sulphur fuel in port and close to some coasts; it can also use abatement technologies to meet emissions guidelines.",
