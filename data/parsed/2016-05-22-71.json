Karen Harding stood awkwardly on a podium waiting for her cue only to realise that she had missed it and only sang the last few lines of God Save the Queen. The singer touched her hand to her ear before eventually joining in after the crowds, footballers and Prince William had already been singing for around 30 seconds. Immediately following the performance, she blamed the delay on technical difficulties. She tweeted: \u201cOh My God. Biggest audience of my life and I get technical difficulties! Argh so sorry Guys!!!\u201d She later added: \u201cMortified!! I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d With millions more people watching around the world, fans and commentators on social media were unforgiving. Oscar Quaye tweeted: \u201cShe had ONE job and flopped ... how embarrassing\u201d, while Piers Morgan quipped: \u201cDid Louis van Gaal advise that female singer for the anthem? \u2018Do nothing for the first half\u2026\u2019\u201d Others were slightly kinder, with fan Natasha Henry tweeting: \u201cPoor girl.\u201d Meanwhile, BBC presenter Gary Lineker, who was hosting the television coverage, merely said: \u201cWell that all went according to plan\u201d. Prior to her performance at Wembley as Manchester United beat Crystal Palace 2-1 to win the famous trophy, the singer described the event as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime chance\u201d, and added nervously: \u201cThe main thing is not being able to hear myself ... there\u2019s going to be so many people singing it back.\u201d After the mishap, BBC commentator Guy Mowbray defended Harding, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise around the place, it\u2019s easy to miss your cue.\u201d  Harding, a former Eurovision contestant, had followed the performance of rapper Tinie Tempah. Tempah\u2019s performance was also criticised. Fans mocked his outfit and viewers were also unhappy that he seemed to be checking his phone while walking towards the stage. The pre-match entertainment was also likened to the Super Bowl \u2013 the American Football end-of-season spectacle. Another commentator on the final, Alan Green, said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cWhoever was responsible for the [pre-match show], an utter shambles, should go away now and lock themselves in a darkened room.\u201d In 2010, Harding competed to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song contest, with Your Country Needs You, but was beaten by Josh Dubovie with his song That Sounds Good to Me. She went on to appear on The X Factor in 2013, but was replaced during the show\u2019s six-chairs challenge stage by mentor Nicole Scherzinger, with Melanie McCabe taking her seat. In January 2015 she released her own single, Say Something, which went to No 7 in the UK\u2019s singles chart.",
