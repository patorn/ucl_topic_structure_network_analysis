  "body": "The Manic Street Preachers have finally revealed their official Euro 2016 anthem for the Wales national team, Together Stronger (C\u2019mon Wales). The song, with a video featuring the Wales football squad pogoing along behind the band, pays tribute to the former Wales player and manager Gary Speed, gripes about Joe Jordan\u2019s handball playing for Scotland against Wales in a decisive qualifying match for the 1978 World Cup finals, and namechecks large chunks of the current squad, with special attention paid in the chorus to Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.   Related: Manic Street Preachers' Everything Must Go turns 20 \u2013 in pictures    \u201cNick [Wire] had written lyrics for a song during previous campaigns, but of course, they\u2019d all bitten the dust,\u201d singer James Dean Bradfield told Wales Online. \u201cIt was the Belgium home game where the cogs in Nick\u2019s head started whirring when we knew it was game on and we had a great chance of qualifying.\u201d He added: \u201cYou always wonder if you can actually pull off a football song, because let\u2019s face it there have been so many bad ones out there. We\u2019ve got to admit that the benchmarks are Three Lions and World In Motion \u2013 they are two great football songs.\u201d But is it a World in Motion, or more of a Come on You Reds? Watch the video and decide for yourself.",
