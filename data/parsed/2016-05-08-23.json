He plans to address Monday evening\u2019s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, alongside the new mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who was forced to deny on Sunday that he had an eye on the Labour leadership himself, after appearing to criticise Corbyn\u2019s electoral strategy. Asked by the Guardian if Corbyn should lead Labour into the next general election, Khan said: \u201cThe Labour movement can only improve people\u2019s lives by winning elections. The last time we won a mayoral election was 2004. The last time we won a big election was 2005 ... We don\u2019t win elections by just talking to people who already vote Labour.\u201d The Labour leader\u2019s allies hailed as fantastic the results of Thursday\u2019s elections, in which they also took the Bristol mayoralty, remained the largest party in Wales and held on to key councils in swing constituencies such as Harlow. Corbyn travelled to Bristol to congratulate the new mayor, Marvin Rees, whose unexpected victory, as a black man in a city whose riches were built on the slave trade, is viewed as a significant political milestone.

However, sceptical MPs have said they believe the performance was not enough to build a majority in 2020, which will require what Khan called a \u201cbig tent\u201d strategy, to win over Conservative supporters. There is deep concern about the result in the Scottish parliament, where Labour slipped into third place, behind the Conservative party. Following Khan\u2019s 14 percentage point victory over Zac Goldsmith \u2013 the biggest in a mayoral election since 2000 \u2013 he said it was not for him to advise the party\u2019s leader on how to win seats in other parts of England, Scotland and Wales, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in heroic failure. I believe in winning elections to change people\u2019s lives for the better.\u201d His comments may increase perceptions at Westminster that a new Labour power base is forming in the capital, with ambitions on the national party, but he moved to quell that, saying: \u201cCity Hall is not going to be used as a springboard for a challenge to the leadership or a coup or for me to give running commentary. Jeremy Corbyn has a big job to do as leader of the Labour party. My job is to be mayor of London.\u201d Separately, a report based on interviews with swing voters in the key parliamentary seat of Nuneaton and shared with the Guardian underlined the scale of the challenge facing Labour. In focus groups carried out by Ed Miliband\u2019s former pollster James Morris, a panel of former Labour voters in the Warwickshire town said they viewed Corbyn as \u201cold-fashioned\u201d or \u201cscruffy\u201d. Participants were unenthusiastic about the Conservatives and keen to give Labour a chance, Morris found, but many had a negative view of Corbyn.  Corbyn and his team firmly reject the \u201cfocus group politics\u201d of the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years, which they believe spawned a generation of \u201cplastic politicians\u201d. But Morris and his co-author Ian Warren, another former Labour pollster, say the public\u2019s inability to see Miliband as a potential prime minister was key to Labour\u2019s loss of last year\u2019s general election \u2013 and they warn that voters who are not firm Labour supporters appear to be even more wary of Corbyn. The mood among the leader\u2019s critics was not helped on Sunday when shadow chancellor John McDonnell sparked a public spat with the Blairite backbench MP Caroline Flint on Twitter, urging her to withdraw comments she had attributed to him about the local elections.         Khan spoke to the Guardian after his first official engagement, the Yom Hashoah Holocaust memorial service in Barnet, which signalled a clear attempt to distance himself from the Labour leadership\u2019s handling of recent allegations of antisemitism inside the party, which included incidents such as Naz Shah MP suggesting that Israel\u2019s Jews should be sent to live in the US and Ken Livingstone attempted to defend her by claiming Hitler had supported Zionism. Khan said he planned to \u201chit the ground running\u201d, holding meetings on Monday with the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the head of the fire service and with Transport for London. \u201cThe key thing for me is to tackle the housing crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI am bringing together an alliance of people from local authorities, housing associations, developers, those in finance to make sure we start building the genuine affordable homes we need. I have spent this weekend working on that and a number of other things.\u201d He said the alliance would change London\u2019s overall strategic plan and publish new supplementary planning guidance, both policies that govern the amount of affordable housing that developers are obliged to build when they erect new private homes. He believes his pledge to tackle the housing crisis has allowed him to reach out to voters across the political spectrum.   Speaking following the Holocaust memorial service, the mayor said he had lost some Jewish votes \u201cbecause of the antics of members of the party making comments that are clearly unacceptable and disgusting\u201d. Corbyn announced an independent review into antisemitism and other forms of racism in the Labour party, chaired by former Liberty chair Shami Chakrabarti, after suspending both Shah and Livingstone. Khan was greeted warmly by members of the Jewish community when he arrived at a reception before the ceremony. He met the chief rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, Holocaust survivors and leading figures in the Jewish community, including Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Mark Regev, former Labour fundraiser Lord Levy and Eric Pickles, the government\u2019s ambassador on post-Holocaust issues. Henry Grunwald QC, chairman of the National Holocaust Centre, told Khan from the stage: \u201cYou have promised to be a mayor for all Londoners. By your attendance here today we hope that you are beginning to fulfil that pledge.\u201d With all but one of the local council results nationally announced by the end of Sunday, Labour had lost a net 24 seats \u2013 rare for an opposition party, but not as bad as many projections had suggested. The Conservatives lost 46 seats. Corbyn will be able to introduce two new Labour MPs, Gill Furness and Christopher Elmore, after the party won byelections in Sheffield Brightside and Ogmore in Wales, held on the same day as the other polls.",
