Overall shop prices \u2013 including both food and non-food \u2013 fell by 1.7% in April compared with a year earlier. That was the same rate of deflation as in March, according to the BRC-Nielsen shop price index. The BRC chief executive described the three-year milestone as an \u201cimportant anniversary for retailers and shoppers alike\u201d.   Related: M&S expected to benefit most from BHS collapse    \u201cWe\u2019ve seen three years of falling shop prices,\u201d Helen Dickinson said. \u201cThe 36 consecutive months of price falls is being driven by intense competition across the industry. It has knock-on implications for margins and profitability given the combination of continued investment in digital and rising cost pressures.\u201d Excluding food, prices dropped 2.9% in April compared with a year earlier. Within that clothing and footwear prices slumped 7.1% amid heavy discounting to clear last season\u2019s fashions. The drop in non-food prices was an acceleration of the 2.6% fall recorded in March, with canny shoppers also able to find bargains in electrical, furniture and floor-coverings stores. Non-food prices have fallen for the past for 37 months. It was a different picture in food, where prices started to climb in April, up 0.1% compared with the 0.4% decline of the previous two months. With supermarkets cutting the price of fruit, vegetables and meat to win shoppers the cost of fresh foods fell by 0.5%, albeit a slowdown from the 0.9% decline seen in March. However, the price of ambient lines continued to rise, up 1.0% from a 0.4% rise in March.     The drop in non-food prices was an acceleration of the 2.6% fall recorded in March.

The new season has also got off to a slow start because of the cool weather. Analysts say there are too many mouths to feed on a high street battling the growth of online retailers while staff costs are rising due to the national living wage. The strength of the US currency last year also created a squeeze because retailers buy many garments in dollars but sell them in sterling. Next is due to update the City on first-quarter trading on Wednesday. RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain predicted like-for-like sales at its stores would be down at least 3% with sales from its Directory catalogue arm also slightly lower. The tough conditions mean retailers might have to go even further to drum up business, Watkins said. \u201cThe cool spring has impacted the sales of many retailers, and an increase in the levels of promotion over the next few weeks to drive footfall is not out of the question,\u201d he said.",
