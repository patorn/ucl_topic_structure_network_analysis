Personally, I thought about not writing this piece at all, and instead demanding that a stranger give me some money. I mean, why not? It seems de rigueur to ask for cash for doing nothing. Take the case of the newlyweds who thought it was perfectly OK to contact a wedding guest to point out that the \u00a3100 cheque she had given them was insufficient, helpfully adding: \u201cIf you wanted to send any adjustment it would be thankfully received.\u201d   Related: Bride and groom write to guest demanding 'adjustment' to \u00a3100 gift    This outrage, the most compelling Mumsnet thread since penis beaker-gate, seems to have struck a chord \u2013 the poster has since been inundated with more than a thousand responses, many urging her to cancel the cheque. And this sort of entitled behaviour isn\u2019t rare. There\u2019s Emma McCormick, the student who set up a crowdfunding account after saying she had blown her student loan on partying. McCormick later said she was joking, but then again, perhaps she would \u2013 she only raised \u00a310. She added that she was inspired by Kanye West, who recently took to Twitter to ask for cash, claiming he was $53m in debt. Presumably, he wasn\u2019t joking.    I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart...\u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 14, 2016    Also not a joke (unfortunately), is a website where women can ask strangers to fund their breast enlargements. It\u2019s an American site, but the Daily Mail helpfully points out that \u201cthousands\u201d of British women have signed up. You might think that this sort of brazenness is a symptom of our self-obsessed selfie and social media age. Something to do with entitled millennials expecting everything for free. But consider the Private Eye classifieds, which have long puzzled me. For years, in the Eye Need section at the back of the magazine, pleas for money have appeared, accompanied by bank account details. Some of these are hard-luck stories \u2013 although how anyone can tell whether they are genuine or not is beyond me \u2013 and some are simply unabashed requests for dough, such as the \u201cattractive mezzo-soprano (aged 27) seeking benefactor for conservatoire fees\u201d. Well, OK then. Perhaps I\u2019ve missed something. Perhaps it\u2019s OK to ask strangers for cash. I take an exhaustive, scientific poll of three friends. One says she would consider it if she was desperate. Another if \u201che was starving\u201d. The third \u2013 no. \u201cI felt bad enough asking for sponsorship when I did charity stuff,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a confusing area. The line between asking for cash for a genuinely good cause \u2013 paying for medical bills, for example; and a frivolous one \u2013 new tits \u2013 is not always clear. As is the line between genuine need and simple greed.   Related: Does the march of civilisation stop at the bedroom door? | Emer O'Toole    I may be being terribly British, but I\u2019d rather be carted off to debtor\u2019s prison than face the embarrassment of asking people I don\u2019t know for money. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t sleep on a bed of \u00a350 notes. I\u2019ve been up against it financially many times in my life. And I did the sensible thing \u2013 I got hideously in debt and ended up with a pile of interest, late fees, threatening letters and a heap of massive stress. And if you are getting married and considering asking your nearest and dearest for some cold, hard moolah, consider this tale of caution. A friend was recently invited to a wedding where the couple asked for cash gifts \u2013 not for anything specific, mind you, just money: \u201cI took offence at the implication that I couldn\u2019t be trusted to buy them something nice. They were loaded anyway. They got fuck all from me. Just a card.\u201d",
