  "body": "Unlike in the votes that took place last week, there was a sizable number of delegates available in the Democratic primaries that were held in Kentucky and Oregon on Tuesday. But the wins for Bernie Sanders in Oregon and Hillary Clinton in Kentucky still ultimately don\u2019t change much. Because primary season has slowed to a tortoise race, the frontrunners (Republicans also voted, in Oregon) simply inched a little closer to the finish line.   Related: Bernie Sanders takes Oregon primary while Clinton claims Kentucky    Donald Trump now needs only 135 more delegates to secure the Republican party nomination, and Clinton \u2013 assuming she can count on the support of superdelegates \u2013 is a mere 92 delegates away from becoming the Democratic nominee. But Clinton is still fighting for her wins. In Kentucky, the former secretary of state finished the night with 47% of the vote, and an additional 27 delegates as a result. However, Sanders was such a close second (with fewer than 2,000 votes between the two candidates, he ended the night only half a percentage point behind Clinton) that he too managed to pick up 27 delegates. Kentucky\u2019s results represent a dramatic change for Clinton compared to her popularity here eight years ago. In the 2008 Kentucky Democratic primary, Clinton got almost half a million votes \u2013 66% of everyone who cast a ballot \u2013 while Barack Obama got 30%. (Kentucky already held its Republican caucus on 5 March; Trump came first with 36% of the vote.)   Kentucky and Oregon   In Oregon, where 75% of the votes have been counted at the time of writing, it seems as though Sanders\u2019 win will be a relatively comfortable one: so far, he has 55% of the vote. Again however, since Democratic rules distribute delegates largely proportional to the vote share, Sanders\u2019 victory in Oregon translates to 28 delegates to Clinton\u2019s 24. All told then, despite two strong performances, Sanders made no real impact on Clinton\u2019s lead. The Vermont senator now needs to win about 90% of the delegates that are still available in the remaining races if he is to become the Democratic nominee \u2013 a near impossible task, not least since polls suggest his popularity in crucial remaining states such as California is only at 41%.

Although other Republican candidates have now suspended their campaigns, their names still appeared on the ballots which were printed some time ago \u2013 so Ted Cruz still collected 17% of the vote, and John Kasich earned 16.4%.  Those vote shares will have little consequence though. Trump won an additional 17 delegates from Oregon and in so doing inched a little closer to what now seems like a fait accompli for the New York businessman: becoming the 2016 Republican presidential nominee.
