  "body": "Asylum seekers who arrived on the Cocos Islands by boat this week appear to have been returned to Sri Lanka by the Australian government. A witness on the island said that after nightfall on Thursday he saw 18 adults and seven children \u201cof Sri Lankan appearance\u201d brought from a Customs vessel docked off the West Island to its wharf, Rumah Baru. They were taken to the airport. The local, who declined to be named, said the transfer was \u201cdone cloak and dagger style\u201d. Cardboard had been placed over the windows of the bus used to transport the asylum seekers \u201cto minimise people getting eyes on them\u201d. The aircraft took off about 9.27pm local time, watched by locals who gathered at the airport\u2019s chain-link fence. The witness said he and others took photographs, and he was in negotiations to sell them to media outlets.  Another witness, who identified herself as Rosie, said she saw a charter aircraft land and take off.   Related: 'Asylum seeker boat' arrives in the Australian territory of the Cocos Islands    The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has declined to answer questions about the boat\u2019s arrival or the fate of its passengers. However, flight records show that a plane left Cocos shortly before 9.30pm on Friday, and arrived in Colombo, Sri Lanka, just after 4am. The charter aircraft is owned by a company with Australian federal government contracts, including for the immigration department. An employee of the company hung up when asked by Guardian Australia to confirm whether the flight was a government-contracted job. On Monday, a wooden vessel, which observers said was probably carrying asylum seekers from Sri Lanka based on the boat\u2019s appearance, travelled into the islands\u2019 bay under its own power and without interception until it nearly made it to shore. Witnesses believed the asylum seekers had not been brought to the islands\u2019 main population centres, where just a few hundred people live, but instead taken aboard the Customs ship that first responded. Last year, four Sri Lankan asylum seekers, intercepted in a boat near the Cocos Islands, were transferred at sea to the custody of the Sri Lankan navy. They were interviewed at sea by border protection officials and the interviews were then assessed by the immigration department. \u201cAll four illegal maritime arrivals were found eligible for return, consistent with Australia\u2019s non-refoulement obligations,\u201d the office of the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, had said at the time.  Under international law, Australia cannot send refugees back to countries in which they may face harm, but the \u201cenhanced screening process\u201d used by the Coalition and the previous Labor governments have been criticised. Asylum seekers returned to Sri Lanka routinely face court on charges of illegally leaving the country. Trevor Grant of the Tamil Refugee Council said he had not had contact with the asylum seekers from the boat that approached Cocos Islands but they would probably be arrested in Sri Lanka.   Related: Four asylum seekers transferred at sea to Sri Lankan authorities    \u201cThey\u2019ll be taken straight to jail, under the laws of that country and held for some time,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cOne of the dangers of being returned, of course, is the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which the Sri Lankan president said he would rescind when he got into power but he still hasn\u2019t done that. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst features of that government, and allows people to be just locked up for 18 months without access to lawyers and just disappeared into the jail system. We\u2019re not sure exactly what their situation is but once you\u2019re in jail in that country, especially if you\u2019re Tamil and had any connection to former Tamil tigers, you\u2019re in grave dangers.\u201d He dismissed the prospect that the asylum seekers might have undergone enhanced screening by Australian officials. \u201cThey\u2019re asked no more than two or three questions in the space of about two or three minutes, if that, and the government decides their situation. It\u2019s a laughable process.\u201d The 27 islands in the Cocos Keeling group, west of Christmas Island, are Australian territory, but are closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland. One resident told Guardian Australia the asylum-seeker boat was first seen by a passenger crossing between two populated islands. The authorities were then alerted, he said. \u201cThe [Australian federal] police were first on the scene and Customs missed it completely. It had got so far in it was close to the shallow waters. If the AFP hadn\u2019t intercepted it, it might have run aground.\u201d",
