  "body": "Punk\u2019s not dead. The spirit is alive and well in Yorkshire if Radio 4\u2019s Punk, the Pistols and the Provinces is anything to go by. Mark Hodkinson\u2019s nostalgia nugget proves that being angry and listening to Johnny Rotten wasn\u2019t confined to London. When punk hit, the \u201ctremors of that earthquake\u201d spread north. Forty years on, Hodkinson roams the streets of northern towns rounding up punks to tell their stories. Once they were \u201cdiscarded, disgruntled provincial kids\u201d and it\u2019s great to hear the fire\u2019s still there. The Chameleons\u2019 Mark Burgess talks about a \u201crebellion against the stodgy, bloated establishment\u201d. \u201cI\u00a0read somewhere that the Queen has given her official blessing to 2016 as the year of punk,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I wanted to throw up.\u201d   Related: Never mind the bus pass: punks look back at their wildest days    Bands such as the Sex Pistols hit a\u00a0nerve with kids in those sleepy towns. \u201cThe furthest north we\u2019d been was Hampstead at the time,\u201d drummer Paul Cook admits, and as they gigged in Northallerton they were up against a tough crowd. Local DJ Brian Simpson recalls having to wake the band up before they went on stage \u2013 before their revolutionary sound drove the audience away. \u201cPeople were leaving the place because they had never heard anything like it before,\u201d he chuckles. It didn\u2019t take the band long to drive middle-of-the-road acts such as the Searchers and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders off the bill, as teenagers found relief from their older brothers\u2019 Eagles albums. The misty-eyed punks fondly recall many anecdotes, such as the time the Pistols played a Christmas Day gig at Ivanhoe\u2019s in Huddersfield for the children of striking firemen, which ended in a cake fight. Now the club is a\u00a0Lidl. Strolling the vegetable aisle reminiscing about the buzz and the music adds a certain wistfulness. If anything\u2019s missing, it\u2019s female voices. Dr Jennifer Otter Bickerdike is permitted a brief mention of how punk \u201cblew the doors off\u201d what women could do and goes on to claim that Hillary Clinton is a descendent of the movement. It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no room to hear from women, as they might just have something to say about rebellion, attitude and railing against the stuffiness of the mostly male establishment.",
