Unofficial Chariots of Fire sequel greenlit in China    The Last Race, which is set for release this year in China and the UK, sees Fiennes play Eric Liddell, aka the Flying Scotsman; the athlete played by Ian Charleson in Hudson\u2019s drama. The deeply-religious Liddell was born in Tientsin, northern China, to Scottish missionaries, and returned there a year after his victory in the 400m at the Paris Olympics in 1924. He became a hero to the Chinese people, partly due to his athletic achievements \u2013 some consider him the first Chinese gold medallist. As Fiennes revealed, the film, from Hong Kong director Stephen Shin, tracks his heroics while interned during the second world war at a Japanese prisoner of war camp in 1943. Liddell organised the smuggling of food into the camp for the 2,000 starving inmates, and refused an opportunity to leave after Winston Churchill intervened on his behalf. He asked instead that a pregnant prisoner be allowed to leave the site in Weifang in east China. He died in 1945, aged 43, from a brain tumour.

Photograph: Flying Scotsman: as Eric Liddell in The Last Race, the unofficial sequel to Chariots of Fire./Cannes Press    Fiennes dubbed his film a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of Liddell\u2019s story following the events that transpire in Chariots of Fire. \u201cWhat that film did was depict famously the moment up to the Olympics,\u201d the actor said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re doing is connected. But it also tells many other lives as well, it\u2019s not just Eric\u2019s story. It picks up and finishes at a place that I knew nothing about. We explore China, and we explore Eric.\u201d For Fiennes, The Last Race marks his first time acting in a fully Chinese production. \u201cFor a few actors, you get invited into another culture; this is a really extraordinary thing to be invited and to be able to see that culture through the eyes of another culture,\u201d Fiennes said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get often get that. As an actor that\u2019s a wonderful opportunity. But also as an individual, you get to open up your mind and see beyond the limits of your own culture.\u201d The actor jokingly said he resembles Liddell, due to his receding hairline, which he pointed to. As for training, Fiennes said he did have to do some, \u201cbeing in my mid 40s,\u201d but that he was grateful the film picked up following Liddell\u2019s Olympics experience. The Last Race has courted some controversy for potentially skirting over Liddell\u2019s Christianity \u2013 Chariots of Fire describes how the runner refused to compete in his favoured 100m event in Paris because the heats were held on a Sunday \u2013 due to the Chinese government\u2019s antipathy towards religion.  Fiennes briefly addressed the matter during the discussion, saying that the film and Laddell\u2019s legacy \u201ctranscend religion\u201d.   Related: Joseph Fiennes: the sequel    \u201cWhether you\u2019re atheist, Buddhist, Catholic, I think we can all agree that what Eric did \u2013 and our beautiful film does \u2013 is promote a sense of care,\u201d Fiennes said. \u201cCare towards those who are less fortunate. I looked at Eric and his beliefs as a set of principles that you can put in your daily life, which are not caught up in the dogma of religion. It\u2019s care towards your fellow human being and putting that fellow person before yourself. \u201cThat\u2019s something I try daily to struggle with,\u201d Fiennes added. \u201cI\u2019m fallible. We are fallible. Eric is a wonderful example of a man who could raise the moral bar \u2013 and he did \u2013 and stick to it.\u201d Following his trip to Cannes, Fiennes returns to rehearsals to play Lawrence of Arabia in Adrian Noble\u2019s Chichester Festival revival of Terence Rattigan\u2019s play Ross.",
