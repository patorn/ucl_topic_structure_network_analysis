Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho can mould an exciting, attacking Manchester United side | Michael Cox    The Portuguese\u2019s imminent replacement of Louis van Gaal as manager will lead to major surgery on the squad but has boosted several previously unhappy players, notably David de Gea, Michael Carrick and Ander Herrera. Juan Mata, though, scorer of the equaliser in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final, could leave, as Mourinho sold the Spaniard to United in January 2014 when he was in charge of Chelsea. Mourinho is understood to retain an interest in Stones, who is valued at more than \u00a340m and whom he tried to sign for Chelsea from Everton last summer, and faces a fight for the England international with Manchester City. United have also made inquiries to Juventus about Morata\u2019s team-mates Alex Sandro, a left-back, and Paul Pogba, the former United midfielder. However the club was quoted \u00a3116m (\u20ac150m) for each, a price designed to end United\u2019s interest. It would constitute a major surprise if United were not to confirm Van Gaal\u2019s departure on Monday and swiftly install Mourinho. Despite Mourinho being out of work since December and having no formal contact with Ed Woodward until this month, when the executive vice\u2011chairman finally made a move for him, the Portuguese has been drawing up a list of potential acquisitions in the expectation of being offered the job.           Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?    Mourinho has been aided in this by Jorge Mendes, his representative and one of the world\u2019s most powerful agents, with an extensive network of contacts. Many\u00a0players who are Mendes clients are of interest to the incoming United manager. Valencia\u2019s Portugal midfielder Gomes, 22, would cost around \u00a340m, has five caps, and won the Primeira Liga with Benfica in 2014. Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio, 23, also a Portugal midfielder, plays for Sporting. He has eight caps and he would cost at least \u00a327m. His father, Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio Eduardo, has previously said that Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio would be priced at more than the \u00a326.7m Bayern Munch recently paid Benfica for Renato Sanches to join them next season. Mourinho\u2019s interest in Gomes and J\u00f5ao M\u00e1rio suggests Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has suffered an injury-plagued first season at United and who is 32 in August, may be under threat. Carrick is now minded to stay at the club but he is 35 in July and can no longer be relied upon to play twice a week. Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s Garay previously played under Mourinho at Real Madrid and is a 29-year-old centre-back who is a seasoned Argentina international with 32 caps. However, as Mourinho sold him to Benfica in 2011, Garay may be a second choice after Stones. Icardi is a 23-year-old Argentinian striker who captains Internazionale and is on Mourinho\u2019s list as a fall-back option for Morata should one be required. Javier Zanetti, Inter\u2019s vice-president, has signalled that the club would be resistant to his sale. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see [about who we might have to sell], but we\u2019ve got to talk to Roberto Mancini [the coach] about it first\u00a0to make plans for next season,\u201d he told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \u201cIn any case, Icardi is certainly going to stay. He\u2019s our captain and even he\u2019s said that he\u2019s\u00a0staying.\u201d   Related: Louis van Gaal: from Iron Tulip to muddled thinker at Manchester United    Morata would cost around \u00a340m as Real Madrid are expected to activate their \u00a323.6m buyback clause from Juve and listen to offers in this region for him. The Spanish striker is thought to a favour a move to United over a host of other clubs because of Mourinho\u2019s likely appointment at Old Trafford. Despite De Gea enjoying another superb season for United, being voted the player of the year by fans for a record third consecutive campaign, he was minded to depart should Van Gaal be granted the final season of his contract. Van Gaal\u2019s awkward style of management has caused widespread disquiet among his players. Despite Carrick being the vice-captain and a regular pick under the 64-year-old Dutchman, the veteran, who is out of contract in the close season, was also seriously contemplating leaving if Van Gaal remained. However the arrival of Mourinho has changed the view of Carrick and De Gea, and this is also reflected among many of the rest of the squad. Herrera is another player who has struggled to enjoy a concerted run in the side under Van Gaal and is now hopeful of a fresh start under Mourinho. If De Gea does stay it would represent a sizeable coup as the Spanish international goalkeeper nearly joined Real Madrid at the end of last August\u2019s transfer window.",
