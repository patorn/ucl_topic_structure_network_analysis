  "body": "Is it really almost 40 years old? Watching this gem again in the director\u2019s cut \u2013 it is also a very rare actual screenwriting credit for Spielberg \u2013 makes you realise that it may be the nearest thing he created to an old-fashioned epic, and that maybe the vision of Devil\u2019s Tower in Wyoming was a Spielbergisation of John Ford.    Related: Joss Whedon: the film that changed my life    But this is a sci-fi classic that needs no other referents. As with his later ET, the first signs of an alien visit are registered through the eyes of children with their instinctively generous reverence \u2013 but also through deadpan officialdom and all its occult, scientific dial-twitches and readings. The coolly extended scene-setting dialogue, with over-talking and middle-distance sound design, still feels great. Casting Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as the chief investigating scientist Lacombe was a left-field masterstroke; I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 if Jean-Luc Godard was going to be in it, he would have wanted to play the alien, and not a very nice alien, either. Richard Dreyfuss is the everyman who is touched and sunburned and exalted by his close encounter. His cherubic whiskered face has never looked more like a child\u2019s or a saint\u2019s. John Williams\u2019s eerie five-note alien music-language, ending questioningly on the dominant (like a broken toy), is repeated over and over again until exactly the right cosmic tempo is found for communication. Another inspired touch. Time for another encounter.",
