I tossed crab, which is always a treat, in a salad of buckwheat, an ingredient with which I\u2019ve recently become fascinated. The crab\u2019s sweetness stood out against the earthy grain, and was mellowed by bittersweet grapefruit. (If you find buckwheat too strong, soften it by mixing it 50:50 with wild rice.) Brown shrimps are another seaside luxury, and these I potted in a mace-laced butter. Nothing beats butter melting on bread fresh from the oven, and a fast and easy soda bread was the perfect match for the shrimps; mine uses Kamut flour, an ancient wheat variety readily available in supermarkets and easier to digest than conventional flour. Crab, grapefruit and buckwheat salad Nutty buckwheat is a great partner for delicate crab and dill, all lightened with a sharp, sweet dressing. This salad is great with crispbreads and a garlic mayo (use wild garlic, if you can). Serves four. 150g buckwheat\u00bd large cucumber, chopped1 small bunch dill, roughly chopped2 spring onions, finely sliced1 pink grapefruit, segmented200g white crab meatSalt and freshly ground black pepper For the dressing1 tbsp cider vinegar\u00bd tsp sugarJuice of 1 lime4 tbsp rapeseed oil For the allioli (optional)1 handful wild garlic leaves (or 3 cloves garlic, peeled)2 free-range egg yolks250ml mild olive oilLemon juice In a small pan on a medium heat, toast the buckwheat for five minutes. Bring a litre of salted water to a boil, add the buckwheat and simmer for 10 minutes (or as instructed on the packet), until the grains are almost tender and have absorbed most of the water. Drain and leave to cool a little.  To make the allioli, if using, finely chop the wild garlic leaves (or whole cloves), put in a food processor with the egg yolks and a generous pinch of salt, and blitz briefly. With the motor running, very slowly drip three-quarters of the oil through the funnel until the mix starts to thicken and emulsify, then pour in the rest of the oil in a slow, steady stream. Season to taste with lemon juice and salt, loosen to a thick mayo consistency with a few tablespoons of water and transfer to a bowl. Whisk the dressing ingredients in the base of a serving dish, season to taste, then add all the ingredients for the salad and toss. Serve with crusty bread or baked pitta crisps, and the garlicky mayonnaise.

Prop styling: Jennifer Kay    Kamut is a trademarked khorasan wheat flour of the sort I mentioned here the other week. It needs more liquid than other flours, so add just enough to make a wet, sticky dough. The buttery shrimps are gorgeous on the warm nutty bread. Serves four. 500g Kamut (or other khorasan) flour, plus extra for dusting1 tsp fine sea salt1 tsp bicarbonate of soda200ml natural whole milk yoghurt300ml whole milk150ml buttermilkOlive oil, for greasing1 tbsp pumpkin seeds For the shrimps200g butter1 blade mace1 bay leaf\u00bc tsp paprikaJuice from \u00bd lemon200g peeled brown shrimpsLemon wedges, to serve Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Mix the dry ingredients for the bread, then quickly stir in the yoghurt, milk and buttermilk, either by hand or with a dough hook on a food processor. Don\u2019t overwork, or the loaf will be on the heavy side. Form into a wet ball, then put on an oiled baking sheet. Score a deep cross in the top of the loaf, sprinkle with flour and pumpkin seeds, then bake on the middle shelf for 50 minutes to an hour, until the base sounds hollow when you tap it. Leave to cool (remember, it will keep cooking once out of the oven). For the shrimps, melt the butter in a pan, then add all the other ingredients apart from the shrimps and lemon wedges. Simmer for a couple of minutes, taking care that the butter doesn\u2019t burn, then take off the heat. When the butter has cooled a little, but not completely, add the shrimps, season and stir. Put the pan in the fridge and stir every three minutes for 15 minutes, until the butter begins to firm up. Before it hardens completely, transfer the buttery prawns to four 150ml ramekins, then leave to set for 20 minutes out of the fridge. If not serving them immediately, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate; take out about 20 minutes before serving, to soften. Serve with thick slices of the warm soda bread and lemon wedges.

Add 200g coarsely grated mature cheddar to the spare dough, as well as three finely chopped spring onions and a pinch of cayenne, and shape into scones. Bake for 25-30 minutes and serve with a tomato chilli jam and cream cheese or goat\u2019s cheese. Add an extra cucumber to the spare half-cucumber from the crab salad, and make a pickle. Finely slice the cukes and two banana shallots and put in a bowl or jar. Gently heat equal quantities of cider vinegar and water, pour over the cucumber mix, then season to taste (add some chilli, if you like). Dilute and chill the pickling liquor with a few cubes of ice, cover and refrigerate for at least a few hours. (This pickle would work very well with the shrimps, by the way.) Toss any leftover crab in the garlic mayo, stuff inside an avocado half, season with lime and a touch of smoked paprika, and eat with a crisp, baby gem salad.",
