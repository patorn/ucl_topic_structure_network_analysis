  "body": "The cover says Violin Sonatas, but the tracklist says Sonatas for Keyboard and Violin \u2013 and as this is Mozart, both descriptions apply. The balance between pianist C\u00e9dric Tiberghien and violinist Alina Ibragimova on this recording is as beautifully calibrated as always in this long-standing partnership, but here, unusually, it is Tiberghien\u2019s poised, lyrical piano playing that is, more often than not, to the fore. This double CD takes in seven works in non-chronological order, from the eight-year-old Mozart\u2019s Sonata in B flat, K10 \u2013 originally published as a keyboard piece with optional violin \u2013 and the E flat major K481, written just before his 30th birthday. Each work gets a subtly different approach. Highlights include Ibragimova\u2019s tone as she blossoms into the major-key slow theme in the adagio of K481, and Tiberghien\u2019s echoey, bell\u2011like episode in the Sonata, K14; but there is something to raise a smile in every single movement.",
