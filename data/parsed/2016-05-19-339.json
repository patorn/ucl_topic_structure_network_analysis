  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull has dismissed claims by the Grattan Institute that his plan to cut the company tax rate by 5% will deliver just half the benefit he has been claiming since budget night. A centrepiece of the government\u2019s budget is the plan to cut the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25% over the next decade. The government has relied on Treasury modelling to show that the tax cut will permanently boost gross domestic product by 1.2% in the long term \u2013 with Treasury relying on other work to suggest \u201clong term\u201d could mean 20 years \u2013 at the cost of $48.2bn.   Related: Peter Dutton 'demonised' by Labor over refugee remarks, says Malcolm Turnbull    The tax cut won\u2019t come into full effect until 2026-27, so the full benefits won\u2019t be felt until 2046-47. But Grattan Institute director John Daley says the claimed benefits to growth and national income from the 5% tax cut are far less than the government has been suggesting. In an opinion piece on Thursday, Daley said the research Treasury relied on to model the company tax cut showed the net benefits would be much smaller than voters may believe. He says the government says growth domestic product will be boosted by 1.2% but GDP is a misleading measurement of the economic benefits flowing to Australians because the real benefits \u2013 in the form of income \u2013 will flow disproportionately to foreign corporations. He says that, looking at gross national income to see how much of the benefits will go directly to Australians, Treasury\u2019s modelling shows Australia\u2019s income will only increase by 0.8%. \u201cIn other words, about a third of the increase in GDP flows out of the country to foreigners as they pay less tax in Australia,\u201d Daley says. The prime minister dismissed Daley\u2019s argument, saying he does not agree that the net benefit of his tax cut would be only half the headline benefit. \u201cNo. He is wrong,\u201d Turnbull said on Thursday. \u201cOne thing we know for sure is that when you cut business taxes, company taxes, the value of that, the benefit flows back into the economy and overwhelmingly goes back to workers, to labour. \u201cAnd indeed, as you would have seen from the treasurer\u2019s work last year, for every dollar cut in company tax $4 of value created in the overall economy and that is why economists, governments, including previous Labor governments, have supported company tax cuts.\u201d Daley also says when Treasury modelled a scenario in which personal income taxes have to be increased to offset the reduced company tax revenue, GNI will only increase by 0.6% in the long term, or roughly $10bn a year.   Related: Company tax cuts are not a knight in shining armour to save the economy | John Daley and Brendan Coates    He says the government is focusing on GDP growth of 1.2% but the real benefits will be half that, with GNI growth of just 0.6%. \u201c[And] Australia will be waiting 25 years for a 0.6% increase in incomes,\u201d Daley says. \u201cThis economic benefit needs to be seen in context. If Australian per capita GDP and GNI increase at 1.5% a year (as the budget papers routinely assume) then, over 25 years, incomes will rise by 45.1%. Corporate tax cuts mean that instead incomes will rise by 45.7% \u2013 or perhaps a bit less. It may still be worth doing but it\u2019s not a plot twist that dramatically changes Australia\u2019s story.\u201d Earlier this month, Turnbull repeatedly refused to reveal how much his tax cut plan would cost in lost revenue. Parliamentary budget office costings had suggested the tax cuts would cost between $50bn and $60bn over the decade, while leading economist Chris Richardson put the cost at around $55bn. Days later, the treasury secretary, John Fraser, told a Senate estimates hearing the 10-year cost of the government\u2019s tax cut plan would be $48.2bn.",
