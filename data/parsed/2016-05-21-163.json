  "body": "Experienced priests, police officers, nurses and others have shared their wisdom with the new kids on the block for a feature for guardian Weekend magazine. Detective chief superintendent Sue Scott, 49, joined Avon and Somerset Constabulary in 1985 and retired in December 2015. \u201cWhen I joined, you wouldn\u2019t show emotion, just as a self-preservation mechanism. My role models were either austere, autocratic men or women who looked and operated like men, and I don\u2019t think that helped. Perhaps that\u2019s how we got ourselves into that \u2018us and them\u2019 position with the public. When I started, the attitude was very much, \u2018We\u2019re the police, we know best.\u2019 We\u2019re much better at listening now.\u201d PC Lamorna Trahair, 31, finished her two-year probation in April last year and has just passed her sergeant\u2019s exam. \u201cIt\u2019s a really fast pace,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start work the minute you step into a police station, not when your shift starts. Because we have toughbooks [in-car laptops], we don\u2019t have to return to the station to deal with paperwork, so we go from one job to the next, then the next, and that can be pretty draining.\u201d Whether you have a mentor or are the one showing new recruits the ropes we\u2019d like to hear from you. What have you learnt from your job and what advice would you give to those just starting? How has your profession changed since you started? If you\u2019re new to your job what do you hope to get out of it and what are you looking forward to the most? You can share your views with us by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button or by filling in our form below. We\u2019ll feature some of your contribution in our ongoing reporting.",
