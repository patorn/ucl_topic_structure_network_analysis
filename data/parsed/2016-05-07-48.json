  "body": "1930s  Mabel Arnold  100-year-old West Ham supporter My first game was in 1934 \u2013 I think we were playing Manchester United. I\u2019d met my husband, Richard, at a party and he called me every day for a week. On Friday he asked if I wanted to go to football on Saturday. I\u2019d been to Charlton once when I was little and I had to crawl under the turnstiles. But Richard said we\u2019d go to West Ham United. Off we go, we get in there and he asked if I would like some peanuts. So we had a bag of Larkins peanuts and along we go into the Chicken Run on the East side. I\u2019m leaning on the bar and I\u2019m looking at all the people coming in and they\u2019re all laughing. I remember a man pushing me in the back when I first went there because I threw two of the nuts down and the pigeons flew in. \u201cDon\u2019t get the pigeons flying over us,\u201d he said. I thought he was a miserable old thing. But of course you don\u2019t want the pigeons, do you? The Chicken Run was the funniest place you\u2019ve ever stood in. The comments! The things they\u2019d shout out if someone did something wrong \u2013 \u201cYou got another wooden leg you can stick on, you\u2019d do better\u201d \u2013 that was the comment I\u2019d always hear from the old boy who stood behind us. It was a place with the same people coming in, the same East End comments.  1940s  David Gold  Co-owner West Ham United I\u2019d experienced the Nazis dropping bombs as a young kid so it wasn\u2019t totally new to me. But dropping a bomb on a football stadium \u2026 sacrilege! It was August 1944. I rushed over to find out what happened. By this time I\u2019m beginning to understand who I am, what I am, who the team is, what colours we are. I knew West Ham from the opposition. It was a Doodlebug, a V1. I ran over. We saw fire engines and smoke and people running around. Most people were concerned about how many people had been killed but luckily enough there was no game on at the time and it was the middle of the afternoon and it was a surreal experience. It was just across the road from where I lived. But I was a young kid. Two days later I\u2019d forgotten all about it.  1950s  David Gold  I played for the club as a young boy, as a 13-year-old, 14-year-old, 15-year-old, 16-year-old. It was my life, it was all there was in my life because I\u2019d failed at everything else. I\u2019d failed exams and didn\u2019t realise I was dyslexic and there was just this great thing which was playing for West Ham boys and the great thrill was when we played at Upton Park. In those days the kids would play in the morning, an 11 o\u2019clock kick-off, and the reserves would play at 3 o\u2019clock, and that\u2019s why we were knee-deep in mud. Games were played and nobody ever thought of protecting the hallowed turf. One of the greatest memories was when I was a young boy and West Ham were playing the mighty Blackpool, with Stan Mortensen and Stanley Matthews. Great names. Blackpool would be in the First Division and we would be in the league below. They came to Upton Park in the FA Cup and we won 2-1. Afterwards I stood outside waiting for Stanley Matthews in the rain. Then he came out. But because it was raining so heavily, he ran into the coach and I didn\u2019t get his autograph. I was mortified. Fifty years later I\u2019m at Stoke City and a voice behind me said: \u2018Chairman, can I get you a drink?\u2019 I turned round and it was Sir Stanley Matthews. Instead I asked him to sign my programme. I told him it was for my son, David. The thing is, I don\u2019t have any sons.  1960s  Mabel Arnold  My husband ended up working for the club and he would get two tickets. He gave them to me and I\u2019ve been taking my son since he was four years old. There were only those wooden stands. The East Stand where I sit now, it\u2019s just the same, it\u2019s still that hard seat. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ve paid for a better one in the new stadium. It was all a bit rough and ready. I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, all the grounds were like that when we went to away matches. When we went in, we had rattles. I had a lovely rattle for years. I used to lean over and rattle the boys on until they stopped us using them. But we\u2019d all make sure no one forgot to bring their rattle. Jimmy Greaves from Spurs, we used to give him a good rattling. As soon as he came on, he\u2019d acknowledge it and it was a bit of a laugh. Then there was Denis Law from United. He was dirty, him and Geoff Hurst, it was a foregone conclusion they\u2019d have a kicking match. One day I was watching Bobby Moore. You couldn\u2019t help but love him. He was 15. One of the tea ladies over at Chadwell Heath had become ill and Richard asked me to come over and make some tea. This lovely blond boy came in and said, \u2018Can I have a glass of water, please, I\u2019m as dry as a bone.\u2019 I looked at him and thought he was a well-built boy. That\u2019s how I first met Bobby. He was 15. I filled up his glass. He said: \u2018Thanks very much, see you later for tea.\u2019 \u2018If you\u2019re lucky,\u2019 I said. I saw him later and just looked forward to seeing him play. After winning the FA Cup in 1964 we were invited to the dinner and Bobby asked me to dance with him. Blimey, I only got about 12 steps forward with him and all the other women wanted him. But he asked Richard if it was all right if I dance with me, because he knew that Richard and I were East End champions one year in ballroom dancing. He said he\u2019d love me to show him a few steps. I said we\u2019d have to have that private and he laughed his head off. Richard was standing there, going, \u2018Take it easy.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t get far. And he had two left feet. He trod all over my new shoes and my toe was hurting. I told him to move his feet like normal, like he did at football, and he said: \u2018I kick a ball at football.\u2019 We had a laugh. He\u2019d come out of that tunnel and he looked so smart, even in his kit. He would command the place. His stature was so good and you knew he was going to do the hardest he could. The players would play off him. What a presence. He walked in when we were having dinner. The players came in last so that we could clap them \u2013 and then he came. He was laughing and nodding, just the same, no airs and graces.  1970s  Tony Cottee  Former West Ham striker I grew up as a fan of the club and I first went back in 1971. I spent a lot of my youth days in the 70s going to the ground in the days of terracing and the teenagers of today probably can\u2019t get their head round what it was like to stand on the terraces. It was very intimidating and hostile. I know there were a few unsavoury moments but it was also a great time to be fan because it was such an intense atmosphere and when opposing fans came to Upton Park I think they found it difficult to cope. That worked in West Ham\u2019s favour. If you look back, West Ham didn\u2019t do very well away from home but they were a match for anyone at home. Liverpool got beat there in the 80s, Manchester United got beat in the 90s and a lot of that was down to the hostile environment.\u201d  1980s  Steve Bacon  Former club photographer Back in the day there were a couple of women who used to stand in the South Bank with their flasks and at half-time they\u2019d make you a cup of tea, give you a sandwich. They featured on the titles of ITV\u2019s Big Match for quite a long time, these two old dears in the crowd, decked out in their claret and blue hats and scarves. I wasn\u2019t the club photographer in those days but I used to get over there about an hour and a half before a game and I\u2019d maybe go in [then manager] John Lyall\u2019s office and, if television was there, [commentator] Brian Moore would be in the office chatting with John. I\u2019d go in and have a cup of tea. It was such a tight ground. When I started it was the original Chicken Run, very tight to the ground. For floodlight games, they were the best ones, especially when we were lucky enough to be involved in Europe. Those are my favourite occasions, the atmosphere at Upton Park was second to none. You hear players talk about playing over at Upton Park and how close you were to the fans, particularly over in the Chicken Run side on the East side. We had one game in the 80s against Dinamo Tbilisi in the Cup-Winners\u2019 Cup. They were superb and it was the first time I remember an away team being applauded off the pitch by everybody. We had the behind-closed-doors game against Castilla and there had been trouble in the first leg over in the Bernab\u00e9u. I think the official attendance was given as about 265 which included players, press, directors and all that. Playing in an empty stadium, you could hear the players talking to each other. You could hear the commentary from BBC radio down on the pitch. It was eerie. It was the strangest game.  1990s  Terry Land  Upton Park season ticket holder When the ground had to be changed to an all-seater after the Hillsborough disaster, there was talk of leaving Upton Park in the early 90s. There was talk of moving to Beckton and the idea of moving was even put to supporters in a survey but the majority feeling was to stay put. The sentiment was we shall not be moved and the bond scheme arose from that episode. It kicked off in spring \u201992 and what defined the whole era was what happened in the FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park in 1991. We were a Second Division team playing a First Division team in Nottingham Forest. We were 3-0 down with 10 men and someone near my dad stands on his seat and screams out \u201cBilly Bonds\u2019s Claret and Blue Army\u201d. Everyone joined in with a massive show of defiance, until the point where the fourth goal goes in and you can\u2019t hear the Forest fans. We got promotion that year and Terry Brown, the chairman, decides that he\u2019s going to bank that defiance by offering us a bond scheme, which was considered a very poor deal. You would buy a bond for either \u00a3500, \u00a3750 and \u00a3900 and that entitled you to a season ticket. It was pretty offensive. What he didn\u2019t understand was it was that same defiance that would cripple the whole scheme. There was a protest before a game against Wimbledon. A couple of weeks later we played Everton. We lost the game 2-0 and a bloke ran out the crowd, grabbed a corner flag, dug it into the centre circle and sat down. Very quickly he was joined by around 1,000 people on the pitch and that solidified it. There was another one after a game against Arsenal a fortnight later. There was a famous meeting at the Denmark Arms where [director] Peter Storrie got in front of a mob and stood up on a chair and addressed them. I thought he was going to get lynched but he tried to put the point forward. In the end the board sold something like 800 bonds. It was a poisonous atmosphere. The North Bank, the South Bank, the Chicken Run, they were absolutely spitting feathers. Eventually the South Bank was converted into the Bobby Moore Stand in 1993 and the South Bank became the Centenary Stand in 1995. The West Stand went up in 2001 and that changed the focus of the ground away from that dark, enclosed, intimidating bearpit. What happened was they moved the pitch across from the East Stand. Players were terrified to take a throw-in in front of the Chicken Run because it was so close to the pitch. To get any sort of throw-in, you had to lean back into the crowd. It\u2019s this idea that you\u2019re close enough to the crowd to smell them. And in the old West Stand there were ash wooden seats that made a lot of noise, they were really clanky.  2000s  Matthew Etherington  Former West Ham winger We were drawn against Ipswich Town in the Championship play-off semi-finals in 2004. We\u2019d been beaten 1-0 in the first leg and there was a lot of pressure. You could sense the tension and anticipation in the ground but we knew it would be a tough game. It was a spring evening, a massive game and the crowd were well up for it before we went out on the pitch to warm up. The first half was a non-event and we didn\u2019t play that well but once I scored the first goal we were brilliant and I put in the cross for Christian Dailly to put us through. The noise when that goal went in, I wish I could relive it over and over again. It\u2019s only when you\u2019ve finished your career that you realise how special those moments are. I hadn\u2019t seen an atmosphere like that at Upton Park before. I knew what the crowd were capable of but there was discontent there from the previous season. But that was a big-time atmosphere and boy did they deliver. It was unbelievable that night. When you play in a big atmosphere, you sense it in the warm-up. You realise that the ground is going to be rocking. It felt like the crowd was pushing us over the line. I remember Alan Pardew running into the crowd to celebrate and everyone went mental.  2010s  Gary Firmager  Over Land and Sea fanzine editor I\u2019ve been doing this for 27 years, the same plot in Green Street, watching the street of old, watching the people coming down. It\u2019s indescribable. Any other fan who\u2019s done the same thing that I have over the years will be able to tell you how exciting it is. This is my show, standing on this ladder and selling my magazine. But I\u2019m packing it up after 27 years. Time has killed it really. When I started this, there was no internet. The internet\u2019s killed the magazine. But that\u2019s the way it goes. Rupert Jones Matchday steward I\u2019ve been doing security at Upton Park for four years. I\u2019m a massive West Ham fan. It\u2019s an amazing experience. I\u2019ve supported them since I was seven. I\u2019m at the Trevor Brooking End, in a bit where all the singing comes from. The atmosphere down there is electric. When we were in the Championship, that\u2019s where they put me. Most people were reluctant but I said I would do it. It can be quite difficult at times. They\u2019re quite vocal. And it\u2019s amazing when the players are that close. They know who you are and go out of their way to talk to you. I\u2019ll miss all that. But it\u2019s time to move on.",
