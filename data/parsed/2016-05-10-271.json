  "body": "The prime minister has made it crystal clear in recent months that he wants to see more children adopted, faster. But following two landmark appeal court cases, the brakes are firmly on: family judges are applying the full rigour of statute to local authority evidence when applications are made for adoption placement orders. The result, much to some politicians\u2019 vocal displeasure, is that the number of children placed for adoption has fallen significantly.  Caught between the pressure of ministerial urgings and the stringent demands of adoption law are child protection social workers, who must make finely balanced judgment calls on what option they believe is best for a vulnerable child \u2013 with a final court decision now required within 26 weeks of a care application being made. And it is in this uncomfortable, risky space that the British Association of Social Workers (BASW) last week launched a year-long inquiry into the role of the social worker in adoption. The intention is to interrogate the ethical and human rights bases on which recommendations for severing a birth family\u2019s legal bond with a child are made, and lives changed forever.  \u201cWe\u2019re interested in hearing what influences social workers\u2019 decision making around adoption, such as how court timescales influence their decision making, and whether adoption practice is affected by the resources available to families under stress \u2013 do they find they genuinely have enough resources and time to explore the possibility of a child staying with their family?\u201d says Brid Featherstone, professor of social work at Huddersfield University, who together with independent social worker and Royal Holloway senior lecturer Anna Gupta won the bid to lead the inquiry.    Related: Adoption is a traumatic upheaval and our care systems aren't helping    The inquiry comes in the wake of a pointed European Court of Human Rights decision in March, which had a strong message for social workers. Not only did the panel of judges hold that the Portuguese government had violated the Article 8 rights to family life of a mother who had her children removed for adoption solely on the grounds of poverty, but stronger still was the concurring opinion of one judge, who warned social workers that: \u201cAbsolutism in the interpretation of the best interests of the child can easily become a source of formalism on the part of social services; that can in turn degenerate into benevolent paternalism of the state ... It is of the utmost importance that child protection services fully respect the fundamental rights of all, including those of parents, even if these benevolent persons are convinced that they are simply promoting the best interests of the child.\u201d The BASW evidence sessions will be planned by a steering group of adoptive parents, birth parents, adult adoptees and senior law professionals, as well as social work practitioners and academics. Contributions are invited not just from social work professionals \u2013 who may give evidence anonymously if they wish \u2013 but also from birth and adoptive family members, adult adoptees and others with personal and professional experience of the issues raised. It is a mark of how politically sensitive adoption has become that BASW\u2019s new chief executive, Ruth Allen, takes great pains to emphasise that the inquiry will be an \u201cinvestigation of the facts: a robust, honest and balanced look at adoption policy and practice as it\u2019s emerging across the UK\u201d. There is no doubt that while all other European countries allow adoption without the consent of birth parents, England pursues this as an option more vigorously than most of its counterparts; there were around 5,000 adoptions in England last year, of which half were contested all the way to final hearing, compared with a yearly average in the Netherlands of just 28.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a road that every country has followed, so we are aware that we are pursuing something that others haven\u2019t in the same way,\u201d says Featherstone.  Because of this, she says, it is critical that the social work profession \u201ctakes control of its own professional duty around this issue \u2026 and has very serious debates around aspects of our practice and take ownership of the ethics that underpin our work every day. It is important that we don\u2019t just take our mandate from a government, whatever its hue.\u201d    Related: Children in foster care aren't waiting for a loving home \u2013 they are already in one    Professional bodies regularly interrogate their members\u2019 views and experiences, and then define a public position on an issue, points out Maggie Mellon, who recently stepped down from her position as vice-chair of BASW. The British Medical Association, for example, regularly investigates members\u2019 views on assisted dying, and votes on the issue are made public.  Mellon initiated the idea for the inquiry after chairing a BASW conference session at which England\u2019s most senior family judge, Sir James Munby, spoke on the culture of family courts, prompting an outpouring of concerned comments from social workers. \u201cWe need to hear from all our members,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have got an open mind, but we have concerns, and these are legitimate concerns when the government is quite openly at odds with the law.\u201d Of course, if you take the world as it is, rather than as you\u2019d like it to be, Featherstone observes, there is a very good argument for adoption. But she insists that \u201ca good society has to engage with ethical questions constantly. The debate on adoption has always been about its effectiveness: does it work, rather than is it right. We now also need to be asking about its ethics.\u201d To find out more about the inquiry and to submit evidence, contact adoptionenquiry@basw.co.uk Join the Social Care Network to read more pieces like this.
