  "body": "The Labor frontbencher David Feeney is facing questions after it was revealed that he failed to include a $2.3m property in his parliamentary interests register. Feeney, who is in a tight battle with a Greens candidate over his inner Melbourne seat of Batman, says the purchase of the negatively geared house in Northcote is on the public record but he omitted to register it. \u201cI have today written to the register of members interests seeking to rectify my register so that the property is properly found therein,\u201d Feeney told ABC radio.   Related: Government's negative gearing claims dismissed by Grattan Institute report    Feeney is under threat from the Greens in the seat of Batman and Greens member for the neighbouring seat of Melbourne, Adam Bandt, said the issue was confirmation the voters of Batman need a different representative. \u201cAustralia lost a premier over a bottle of wine,\u201d Bandt told ABC radio, referring to the resignation of former premier of New South Wales, Barry O\u2019Farrell. \u201cWhat happens to someone who doesn\u2019t declare a $2.3m property? Feeney told Fairfax Media on Tuesday when questioned about the property that he didn\u2019t know if the house was negatively geared but later confirmed to News Corp that it was. Labor has promised to end negative gearing on all new purchases, other than new builds, if it wins the election. MPs are required to update their register of interests within 28 days and can be found in contempt of parliament and referred to the house privileges committee for investigation.
