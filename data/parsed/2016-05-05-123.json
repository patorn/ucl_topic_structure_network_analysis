  "body": "The New Day\u00a0has\u00a0gone to the great newsstand in the sky. The introduction of a new national daily is rather rare these days, and the enthusiasm with which the public welcomed the New Day\u00a0means we probably won\u2019t see another one any time soon. It launched back in February with the curious aim of appealing to \u201cnormal people\u201d who don\u2019t like reading newspapers, and on this point they were absolutely right \u2013 normal people didn\u2019t want to read this newspaper either. Introducing a print title in the current market requires a strange mixture of madness and optimism, like rowing back towards the sinking Titanic to play a few more rounds of shuffleboard. The whole endeavour seemed doomed from the start. And it\u2019s tempting to interpret the New Day\u2019s disastrous launch as a sign of the times, another indication that the golden age of print has passed. But, in fact, this kind of glorious failure has always been an important part of journalism \u2013 and it\u2019s something worth celebrating.    If the press is to build a sustainable future in the digital world, then we\u2019ll need people with big ideas    The archives of the British Library are filled with the crumbling remains of thousands of unsuccessful newspapers. Flick through this old catalogue of 19th-century titles and see how many you recognise \u2013 it\u2019s like wandering through a graveyard of journalistic dreams. All these papers were launched with high hopes but most fizzled out and were quickly forgotten. Some particularly ill-conceived publications didn\u2019t even make it past their first issue. Who would have thought that the Popular Lawyer (1899), the Post Office Reformer (1871), or the Razor and Hairdresser\u2019s Advertiser (1889) would struggle to find an audience? In fact, some of history\u2019s greatest newspapers came perilously close to a similar fate. Perhaps the most striking comparison is with the New Day\u2019s long-running sister paper \u2013 the Daily Mirror. Launched in 1903 by the press baron Alfred Harmsworth, the founder of the Daily Mail and the most successful newspaperman of the period, he intended it to be the first daily paper aimed at women, who had long been marginalised by the male-dominated daily press. Just like the New Day\u2019s editor, Alison Phillips, Harmsworth sensed an opportunity to unlock a hidden readership who didn\u2019t like the tone and content of existing newspapers. The Mirror would, he promised, be: \u201cno mere bulletin of fashion, but a reflection of women\u2019s interests, women\u2019s thought, women\u2019s work\u201d.     \u2018Harmsworth, as with Alison Phillips over a century later, was supremely confident in his ability to predict what normal people really want.\u2019 Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Harmsworth hired an all-female editorial staff \u2013 an adventurous and progressive move, despite his patronising comments on women\u2019s tastes \u2013 and launched the paper amid a nationwide blaze of publicity. While it did feature some conventional news coverage, the first issue of the Daily Mirror was packed with adverts for department stores and beauty products, and devoted entire pages to fashion, shopping, and weddings. Even the paper\u2019s headlines were presented in a floral, feminine font. Harmsworth, like Phillips over a century later, was supremely confident in his ability to predict what \u201cnormal people\u201d really want. But both got it completely wrong. The Daily Mirror proved, in Harmsworth\u2019s own words, to be a \u201cflat, rank, and unmitigated failure\u201d. The paper was mercilessly mocked by rival publications, and it soon became clear that men refused to be seen buying such a \u201cfeminine\u201d paper. Within a few weeks, the Mirror\u2019s circulation had plummeted from 260,000 to under 40,000. \u201cSome people say that a woman never really knows what she wants,\u201d concluded Harmsworth. \u201c[But] it is certain she knew what she didn\u2019t want. She didn\u2019t want the Daily Mirror.\u201d The paper haemorrhaged money, and after two months Harmsworth had to intervene. However, unlike the current owners of the New Day, he didn\u2019t give up on the project entirely. Instead,\u00a0he abandoned the focus on women, sacked his editorial staff, cut the price of the paper in half, tweaked its name, and put a photograph of a music hall beauty on the front cover. The paper rapidly recovered and went on to become one of the bestselling and most influential tabloids of the 20th century.\u00a0It\u2019s a shame the New Day isn\u2019t owned by somebody with Harmsworth\u2019s bullishness and flair for reinvention. A few months after the paper\u2019s launch, in an astonishingly frank article titled \u201cHow I dropped \u00a3100,000 on the Mirror\u201d, Harmsworth argued that these kind of glorious failures were essential to the evolution of journalism. It was, he argued, the only true way to discover what the public really wanted. Phillips has made similar arguments in the wake of her paper\u2019s collapse \u2013 and they\u2019re both right. If the press is to build a sustainable future in the digital world, then we\u2019ll need people with big ideas and the courage to try them out. To nobody\u2019s great surprise, the\u00a0New Day\u00a0hasn\u2019t turned out to be the future of journalism \u2013 but maybe the next seemingly crazy idea will be. We should salute them for giving it a go.",
