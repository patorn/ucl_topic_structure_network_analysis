He is a happy man who leaves such a legacy behind him.\u201d So wrote Bohuslav Martin\u016f of his Czech compatriot Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.  Over the next few weeks, Manchester\u2019s Hall\u00e9 Orchestra is staging a festival of seven concerts devoted entirely to that legacy. But why, of all composers, does Dvo\u0159\u00e1k need such exclusive attention? Do the hugely famous Slavonic Dances, the Cello Concerto or the New World Symphony \u2013 works featured in the festival \u2013 really need any more exposure? What is it about Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s music that merits such total immersion?             \u201cDvo\u0159\u00e1k was a populist in the best possible way\u201d, says the Hall\u00e9\u2019s music director, Sir Mark Elder. \u201cHe was one of the great tunesmiths and his music has such colour. Being Czech, dance was central to his conception of being a musician, something audiences all around the world relate to. Some of my fellow conductors feel Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s music has nothing to offer intellectually \u2013 one even told me \u2018it isn\u2019t dirty enough\u2019 \u2013 but I love it, and it\u2019s enormously enjoyable to perform \u2013 and of course, to listen to.\u201d   Related: What pop music owes to the classical masters    But the Hall\u00e9\u2019s festival isn\u2019t exclusively focused on the tried and tested bits of the Dvo\u0159\u00e1k canon. There\u2019s a chance to hear the charming Moravian Duets which may have established Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s international reputation, but today are only rarely performed in this country. The same is true of the Piano Concerto, a piece some regard as a curate\u2019s egg. \u201cIt just needs a good advocate,\u201d says Elder. \u201cI know pianists who adore it, including Stephen Hough and Garrick Ohlsson. The piece just needs a bit of tender love and care. I have high hopes we can make some new friends for it.\u201d The title of the festival, Nature, Life and Love, is taken from the subtitles of a trilogy of overtures: In Nature\u2019s Realm, Carnival and Otello. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed them shortly before leaving Bohemia in 1892 to become director of New York\u2019s National Conservatory of Music (he became a considerable celebrity in the city). Musically united by a recurring pastoral theme (which is heard gorgeously in Carnival as a memory of another, distant world), they are nevertheless seldom performed as the triptych Dvo\u0159\u00e1k intended.  Some might lament a lost opportunity to hear Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s earlier symphonies, particularly the underrated Third, Fifth and Sixth; the festival instead features the composer\u2019s last three symphonies, which are all hugely famous. In character these works are distinctive, representing different aspects of their composer\u2019s personality: the Brahms-influenced Seventh is a turbulent affair (though, as Martin\u016f noted, nevertheless ultimately joyful); the Eighth pastoral and high-spirited (it\u2019s even been described as the pigeon-fancying Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s \u201cbirdsong symphony\u201d); while the Ninth, the iconic New World, was a product of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s American years. A special event, Beyond the Score, led by Gerard McBurney on 7 May, promises to place the work in enlightening contexts.    Related: Symphony guide:  Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 9th 'From the New World'    After returning to Bohemia from America, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k became preoccupied with Karel Erben\u2019s nationalistic collection of folk-ballads, Kytice. These stories rival the Brothers Grimm in their delight in the macabre and inspired four superbly graphic symphonic poems \u2013 described by Jan\u00e1\u010dek as \u201cthe most Czech of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s works\u201d. The longest and perhaps the greatest of them is The Golden Spinning Wheel, a piece based on a story Elder describes as \u201cparticularly bloody, with its countless severed limbs\u201d. This magnificently orchestrated work, however, does have a happy ending. The festival culminates with another rarely performed work, the oratorio Saint Ludmila, an expression of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s profound religious faith and patriotism performed in a newly commissioned English translation by David Pountney. This gargantuan piece was premiered at the 1886 Leeds festival and features some of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s most rousing, full-throated choral writing, as well as exquisite arias and ensemble pieces. Though Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had the English taste for Handel in mind as he wrote it, he consistently reveals his own character as a distinctively Czech melodist. The son of a butcher and innkeeper, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s success and fame were hard earned. Brahms, Jan\u00e1\u010dek, Sibelius and even the young Schoenberg admired him, though under Czechoslovakia\u2019s communist regime his music was officially regarded \u2013 not least by the influential culture and education minister Zden\u00e9k Nejedl\u00fd \u2013 as inferior to that of Smetana. \u201cDvo\u0159\u00e1k presents a massive obstacle,\u201d Nejedl\u00fd wrote in 1913, \u201cwhich any young Czech musician must remove from his path if he is to make progress\u201d. As the festival will hopefully remind us, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s music never tried to be progressive. It might not engage deeply with the intellect, but it does with the heart and the imagination in the most direct way possible (does music really have to engage the intellect anyway?). A consummate orchestrator, a supreme melodist, a passionate Czech nationalist with universal appeal, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k continues to speak with immediacy, kindness and humanity. As Martin\u016f put it: \u201cIf anyone expressed a healthy and happy relationship to life, it was he.\u201d  Dvo\u0159\u00e1k: Nature, Life and Love is at Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, from 5-21 May.
