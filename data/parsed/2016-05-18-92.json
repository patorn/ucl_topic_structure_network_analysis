The state\u2019s HB2 bill \u2013 signed by the Republican governor, Pat McCrory, in March \u2013 blocks local governments from creating protections for LGBT people and requires transgender people to use the bathroom for the gender they don\u2019t identify with.   Related: Texas poised to be the next bathroom battleground in transgender fight    \u201cForcing transgender people to use the bathroom of a gender with which they don\u2019t identify isn\u2019t just inconvenient or impractical,\u201d John wrote on the US politics site the Hill. \u201cFor many, especially young students still grappling with their transition, it can be traumatic, and at worst, unsafe.\u201d He added: \u201cThe failure of McCrory and other lawmakers to see this is a failure of compassion, a failure to recognize the difficult and frequently unwelcoming world transgender people must navigate every day, stigmatized by the fear and ignorance of others.\u201d The British singer and LGBT rights campaigner said that worse than signing the bill into law, and using taxpayer money to fight the justice department\u2019s attempt to stop enforcement of the bill, was that McCrory did these things \u201cafter admitting he had never met a transgender person\u201d.  \u201cThis brand of ignorance deliberately shuts out the perspective of an already marginalized community,\u201d John said. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, and it goes beyond bathrooms.\u201d As HB2 was shuttled through the North Carolina state house, activists criticized it as discriminatory and raised questions about how lawmakers could enforce the bathroom part of the law. This was quickly followed by backlash from major businesses including Bank of America, which is headquartered in Charlotte.

The latter two canceled scheduled performances in North Carolina in protest against the law. McCrory\u2019s office responded Wednesday evening: \u201cHaving attended a few Elton John concerts since 1974, I am obviously a fan of his music but his own left-wing political views, shared by President Obama, are respectfully different when it comes to common-sense expectations of privacy in locker rooms, rest rooms and showers \u2013 especially in our schools. This is now a national debate that should welcome dialogue regarding the balance between basic expectations of privacy and equality.\u201d",
