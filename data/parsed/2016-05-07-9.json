  "body": "In the same week that the Halifax decided to increase its age limit for borrowing, so that mortgage terms are extended to the borrower\u2019s 75th or even 80th birthday, Barclays announced the reintroduction of 100% mortgages for the first time since the Noughties recession. The changes have been made in response to ageing demographics, and changing work practices and borrower profiles. It\u2019s a picture that includes people who haven\u2019t paid off their mortgages by the traditional retirement age, people working for longer than they used to and the increasing role of parents in helping their children on to the property ladder. Indeed, a closer look at the Barclays deal reveals that, as well as being more expensive (2.99% compared to 2.79% for a 95% mortgage), and involving an \u201caffordability\u201d check, the 100% mortgages come with another significant condition \u2013 the borrower would need to find a \u201chelper\u201d who can stump up 10% of the property price (returned with interest, after a three-year term, if the borrower hasn\u2019t defaulted). So the 10% is not a straightforward deposit, rather a returnable deposit-cum-guarantee. And a sizeable sum given that the average property price in the UK is now \u00a3189, 901, \u00a3534,785 in the capital. It\u2019s also clear that these \u201chelpers\u201d are most likely to be parents of the borrower. A separate report from Legal and General found that \u201cthe bank of mum and dad\u201d is expected to feature in a quarter of home purchases in 2016. It\u2019s commendable that lenders are reacting to changing times. I\u2019ve never been one to lose sleep over freshly hatched university graduates demanding their \u201cright\u201d to afford property. (Sweethearts, I was squatting, and living in housing association flats, some of it as a mother, until my late 20s. My advice is, be patient, and get over yourselves a bit.) I\u2019m also aware that the modern rental market can be the kind of expensive nightmare I never had to navigate. However, there are still issues raised by this intriguing mortgage bonanza, not least the spectre of elderly people struggling to pay off mortgages, even if they manage to stay employed. (Presumably, society will remain ageist even if mortgage deals aren\u2019t.) Other older people might be extending their mortgages because this is the only way they can help their children. An Experian survey reported that, of the 27% of Britons aged 55 and over who helped their children in this way, 15% said they weren\u2019t financially comfortable themselves. Indeed, it looks as though the Barclays \u201creturnable deposit\u201d would mainly benefit those who can\u2019t afford permanently to tie their money into their children\u2019s property, even if it\u2019s expected of them. Barclays found that 20% of children view such deposits as non-returnable gifts. So much for the selfish, greedy boomers, without a care for the younger generation. Who\u2019s being selfish, greedy and entitled now? In a wider way, for all the changes, how little has changed, particularly regarding the 100% mortgage. Whatever the variables, the fact remains that someone at some point is going to have to produce a very large amount of dosh to help their child on to the property ladder. Taking a wild shot in the dark, I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t going to happen very often among poorer families, however much they\u2019d love to help. These sums would run into tens of thousands of pounds \u2013 the kind of money that people who aren\u2019t well off, or at least holding equity, couldn\u2019t possibly produce, even temporarily. Whatever else might be happening, the UK property market remains a system primarily rigged \u2013 Did I say rigged? I\u2019m sorry, I meant geared \u2013 to middle-class requirements and sensibilities. A classic case of however much things change, they tend to stay the same. Beyonc\u00e9, your fizzing lemonade is an inspiration\u2026     Beyonc\u00e9 on stage last week at the Carter Finley stadium in Tennessee, as part of her Formation world tour. Photograph: Daniela Vesco/Invision    Beyonc\u00e9 appears to have given her allegedly unfaithful husband, Jay-Z, a bit of a ticking off on her latest album, Lemonade. Nothing too serious \u2013 just some exuberant swearing, regrets about \u201cputting the ring on\u201d, some snarling about \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d, and, in the video, a car gets vandalised with a baseball bat. Beyonc\u00e9, you\u2019re fuming, we get it. However, it\u2019s time to untie Jay-Z and let him go, so long as he promises not to actually make that threatened \u201cresponse\u201d album. Joking apart, Beyonc\u00e9 has received criticism for making Lemonade, but I think, good for her. It seems to me that a certain someone might have been relying on his wife being too ashamed, humiliated, or inhibited by their shared fame, to do anything like this. Well, he called that wrong. So sure, it\u2019s all a little public, but it seems justified in this case. Not only has Beyonc\u00e9 demonstrated that any shame belongs to him alone, she\u2019s also shown that, when angry enough, she\u2019s quite capable of living by the Nora Ephron dictum, \u201cEverything is copy\u201d. In this way, Lemonade becomes this generation\u2019s Heartburn, only with baseball bats instead of recipe tips. We loved Boaty, but we love Attenborough more     An artist\u2019s impression of the Sir David Attenborough. Photograph: NERC/PA    The Boaty McBoatface national drama is finally over. The UK\u2019s new polar research ship has been named RRS Sir David Attenborough, and one of it\u2019s sub-sea vehicles will be named Boaty in recognition of the name the public voted for. The evil genius who first suggested Boaty McBoatface, James Hand, has been wonderfully magnanimous \u2013 statesmanlike, dare I say \u2013 describing the new name as a \u201cfitting and excellent choice\u201d while also saying that he\u2019s pleased the Boaty name will \u201clive on\u201d. So that\u2019s that. Fellow Britons, it\u2019s been emotional. Anyone living overseas who\u2019s slightly confused by all the uproar should be aware that this is how this country rolls \u2013 we vote for silly names for boats, sulk when they\u2019re disallowed, and are then instantly soothed and placated by the mere mention of David Attenborough. Forget all that recent election nonsense, this is as definitive a snapshot of modern Britain as you\u2019re ever going to get. Of course, RRS Sir David Attenborough is a fine and appropriate choice, and cunning too. In recent years, Attenborough\u2019s national treasure status has increased to such an extent, it\u2019s become practically treasonable to criticise the penguin-whisperer in any way. If it wasn\u2019t going to be Boaty McBoatface, then only David Attenborough would do. However, I understand why some people remain attached to Boaty McBoatface. Astonishingly for a popular British vote, it involved no gratuitous obscenity, and there was a Trumpton-style sweetness to it. Those nice people at Disney must surely be sniffing around for the film rights (Suggested tag-line: \u201cThe brave little boat \u2026 that couldn\u2019t\u201d). Still, considering the tragic year we\u2019ve been having, another thought occurs. Perhaps this was a missed opportunity - RRS Ziggy anybody? No, let\u2019s save that one for a spaceship.
