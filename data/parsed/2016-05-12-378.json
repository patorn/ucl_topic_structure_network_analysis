  "body": "The Coalition has accused Labor leader Bill Shorten of lying to Australians about the economic benefits of Labor\u2019s multi-billion dollar school funding policy. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, called a press conference on Thursday to make the serious claim against Shorten, saying the opposition leader\u2019s \u201clie [had] been exposed\u201d and demanding he front voters to explain himself. \u201cBill Shorten deliberately misrepresented the OECD data,\u201d Cormann said on Thursday, referring to figures produced by the umbrella group for developed countries.   Related: Bill Shorten makes education a priority as Labor 'underdogs' hit campaign trail    \u201cHe needs to \u2018fess up today that he misled the Australian people when he claimed [an immediate] 2.8% growth effect from his unfunded spending promises on education.\u201d Cormann was referring to a claim by Shorten on Wednesday that Labor\u2019s centre-piece election policy \u2013 its $37.4bn school funding plan \u2013 would boost the economy immediately by 2.8% if implemented. \u201cThere will be a 2.8% \u00adimprovement straight away if we implement these changes, and over the longer term 11% \u00adimprovement to our GDP,\u201d Shorten said. Shorten was citing a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development from 2015 \u2013 Universal Basic Skills \u2013 which estimated the economic gains to Australia if every child was attending secondary school and had acquired basic skills by 2030. The report shows the value of future improvements in the economy from a real boost in educational outcomes to be worth 2.8% of GDP, in today\u2019s dollars, by 2095. It also estimates the economy would be 11% larger in 2095 as a consequence. But Cormann has criticised Shorten for using the OECD report to support Labor\u2019s billion-dollar school funding plan, when the report had nothing to do with Labor\u2019s policy. He said the OECD report did not consider any proposals to increase spending \u2013 it had only estimated the economic effects of better educational outcomes. \u201cBill Shorten either doesn\u2019t understand how the economy works, he doesn\u2019t know how to read economic analysis, or he deliberately set out to mislead the Australian people,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cThe OECD report that Bill Shorten falsely referenced did not point to a 2.8% growth effect straightaway. \u201cIt did, indeed, point to a 2.8% growth effect in 80 years, by 2095, as we have accurately pointed out earlier in the week.\u201d In his national press club speech on Tuesday, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the Liberal party believed education was a cost that should be avoided, but Labor considered it an investment in Australia\u2019s future prosperity. \u201cLet me tell you, there\u2019s a clear and unmistakable economic dividend,\u201d Bowen said in his speech. \u201cThe OECD has identified it \u2013 a 2.8 per cent lift in GDP if we can get every school student with the basic skills they need when they graduate.\u201d Cormann criticised Bowen on Tuesday for misusing that 2.8% figure. But he went on the attack on Thursday following a report the author of the OECD study, Eric Hanushek of Stanford University, believed there would be no \u201cimmediate\u201d boost to growth from education spending. \u201cThe author of the OECD report today made it very clear that there is no systematic relationship between increased spending and additional educational achievement,\u201d Cormann said on Thursday. \u201cLabor has no plan for growth and jobs. And that is why Bill Shorten yesterday sought to misrepresent the OECD report that he was referencing.\u201d",
