Before the new parliament gets under way, we have an opportunity to act on that,\u201d Davidson, 37, declared in a statement demanding that opposition MSPs have a greater role on parliamentary committees and opportunity to question ministers.    Right, home after 40 hours on the go. Pyjamas, hoodie, sofa, Masterchef, large glass of rum, and then to bed....\u2014 Ruth Davidson (@Ruth_E_Davidson) May 6, 2016    \u201cToo often during the last parliament, bad laws were swept in thanks to the SNP majority. Now they are a minority administration, it puts parliament back in control.\u201d The Conservatives are today the official opposition in Scotland. They didn\u2019t merely beat the once almighty Labour party to second place in the Holyrood elections, they thrashed it. Yet if Davidson\u2019s party is emerging from its two decades of purdah in Scotland, and all the evidence suggests that is the case, it is doing so gingerly; displaying the level of circumspection one would expect of a party that its former leader Annabel Goldie admitted had been reduced to a \u201cpolitical comic punchline\u201d since it lost every single one of its MPs in the 1997 general election. \u201cIt is difficult to describe that in terms of bleakness,\u201d said Lady Goldie, who was leader between 2005 and 2011, \u201cit just writes a completely negative script \u2013 it says you are losers, it says you have been chucked out because the voters didn\u2019t like you and how can you come back from that?\u201d Davidson appears to have shown how. On Thursday night, the Tories gained 16 seats at Holyrood, doubling their tally, to finish with 31 MSPs, well ahead of Labour\u2019s 24. Their pitch had been that you didn\u2019t need to be Tory to vote for her, but that she would stand up to the SNP and for the union. The polls had looked reasonably favourable, but Davidson had no expectation at all for winning the constituency seat in Edinburgh Central, believing it more likely that she would take her place courtesy of the proportional representation aspect of the system in Scotland, in which additional members are voted in from regional lists of candidates based on a party\u2019s proportion of votes gained.

Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA    As she arrived at the count on Thursday evening, hand in hand with partner Jen, the speech she was preparing to give was one of congratulations to her SNP opponent. But then it was whispered in her ear that something was happening. \u201cRuth was rewriting her speech right up to going up on stage to hear the result,\u201d one aide admitted. On an extraordinary night, even where the Tories didn\u2019t win, they signalled in many areas where in the 1950s and 1960s they had been the titans of the political scene, that they are again a coming force. In Aberdeenshire East, their vote was up 15%; in Aberdeenshire South and North Kincardine it was up 20%. To the west, the Conservatives earned 7% more in Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch. The SNP majorities in the two seats in Angus were halved. In Stockbridge, an affluent Edinburgh suburb where Davidson picked up significant votes, even those who didn\u2019t vote for the Scottish Tory leader suggested they might in the future. \u201cI could see myself voting Conservative,\u201d admitted Jamie McGarvey, 47, a teacher, who voted SNP. \u201cI think David Cameron is disgusting \u2013 that Bullingdon picture. No. But I could vote for Davidson.\u201d Sir Malcolm Rifkind, formerly a Scottish secretary, defence secretary and foreign secretary, found out how brutal Scottish politics could be when he lost his Edinburgh Pentlands seat in 1997, after representing it for 23 years. He failed to win back the seat in 2001, by which time the Conservatives had come to be regarded as distinctly unpalatable, for reasons including the narrative that they had used Scotland as a guinea pig for the poll tax. He said the events of last week were hugely significant. Labour imploded, but crucially it was seen as acceptable for those moving from Labour to give their support to the Conservatives. \u201cThe Tories in Scotland are no longer toxic,\u201d Rifkind said. \u201cThey are now the main opposition \u2013 and it will solidify. What has happened in the last 48 hours is hugely important. It is not just the collapse of Labour, because they could have gone to the SNP or Liberal. Or Green. But why did they mostly go to the Tories? \u201cI think Ruth Davidson has been a very impressive leader, but that in itself is not sufficient. There has to be more than the personality of one individual, especially when people had written us off as permanently damaged. This goes back to the referendum \u2013 45% voted for independence and that is broadly the same people still voting for the SNP.     Annabel Goldie said Tories had been reduced to a \u201cpolitical comic punchline\u201d in Scotland in 1997. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA    \u201cPeople were increasingly saying that if 45% are voting nationalist we have to unify the unionist cause. The Conservative and Unionist party is the natural unionist party \u2013 it is in its name.\u201d Goldie agreed, but she added that recently even those who supported the Conservatives didn\u2019t believe they were in a position to put up a fight against the SNP, and so they voted tactically. With Labour looking like an enfeebled force, and appearing ambiguous at times about independence, particularly if Britain votes to leave the EU, those voters moved back to where they were more naturally more comfortable. This was helped, Rifkind added, by the allure of the party\u2019s policies on tax in comparison to Labour, who had tacked to the SNP\u2019s left flank. He said there had always been a substantial minority sympathetic to Conservative ideas, but now it was both acceptable and credible to vote for a party that agreed with them. \u201cThe Tories were the only ones saying that not only we won\u2019t put taxes up, but whenever we can we will seek to reduce them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe SNP have not applied the higher threshold on the higher rate of tax, and Labour campaigned to put up the basic rate \u2013 a smart thing to do,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cThe Tories are the only party offering an alternative to the 40% of Scots who are not leftwing. Even if you assume a majority of Scots are left or centre-left, that still leaves 30 to 40% who aren\u2019t. And it will solidify. Because it represents not just a unionist point of view, but a moderate centre-right alternative to the leftwing establishment, or Labour.\u201d Rifkind said he believed that at the heart of Labour\u2019s problem was that the tactics it used to toxify the Conservative brand as anti-Scottish in the 1990s were coming back to haunt them. \u201cWhen devolution was already a major issue, our opponents were able to whip up the idea that we didn\u2019t have a mandate in Scotland and all this sort of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe warned the Labour party at the time that this was a very dangerous argument for them to use. \u201cOnce you say you can\u2019t govern Scotland unless you have a majority in Scotland that is equivalent to saying Scotland should be a separate country. Because essentially they were using nationalist rhetoric despite being a unionist party. \u201cThe Labour party made a huge mistake and they have been reaping that whirlwind ever since.\u201d Rifkind laughed: \u201cThere is a saying in Scotland, \u2018Aye, if ye dinnae ken, ye ken the noo\u2019. To translate, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know before, you do now.\u201d",
