When the film premiered at Cannes last week, the critics didn\u2019t so much sharpen their quills as line up in a firing squad to deliver a fusillade that left the Croisette spattered with blood, venom and one-star reviews.  The Hollywood Reporter called it a \u201cstunningly self-important but numbingly empty cocktail of romance and insulting refugee porn\u201d, while a Guardian headline declared: \u201cAfrican conflict is aphrodisiac for white people in Sean Penn\u2019s crass romance\u201d. Time Out described it as a \u201cpompous, ethically bankrupt humanitarian aid drama\u201d.  Penn, whose Rolling Stone interview with drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n this year was also subjected to fierce criticism, said that while he \u201cproudly\u201d defended his film \u2013 \u201cif people don\u2019t get it, I won\u2019t force them\u201d \u2013 he was now worried it may not get a US release. As Variety noted, the basic problem with The Last Face is that \u201cno matter how \u2018well-meaning\u2019 a director may be, there\u2019s something inherently eye-rolling about being asked to care about the tragedy of African children through the [point of view] of two lovelorn glamour pusses\u201d.  Such criticisms are hardly new. Hollywood\u2019s track record when it comes to nuanced depictions of development, humanitarian crises, poverty and war is, to put it kindly, mixed. When Cary Fukunaga, the director of Sin Nombre and True Detective, was interviewed last year about the struggle to find financial backing for his recent child-soldier drama, Beasts of No Nation, he said life would \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d have been easier if the film had been whiter. Is the sad truth that wars and humanitarian emergencies simply wouldn\u2019t sneak into the multiplexes without bankable, big-name, white stars? Here are some of the recent films that have tried, with varying degrees of success, to balance issues with box office. Beyond Borders (2003)  Tagline: \u201cIn a place she didn\u2019t belong, among people she never knew, she found a way to make a difference.\u201d     Crossing the line \u2026 Angelina Jolie in Martin Campbell\u2019s 2003 drama Beyond Borders. Photograph: Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock    Angelina Jolie plays an affluent American living in 1980s London who leaves behind her comfortable life after meeting Clive Owen\u2019s maverick humanitarian doctor. Their romantic adventures take them to Ethiopia, Cambodia and Chechnya.  \u201cBeyond Borders is rated R,\u201d said a cruel New York Times reviewer. \u201cIt has strong language, sexuality and shameless and scandalously cynical recreations of third world suffering and violence that aren\u2019t even relieved by on-screen alcohol consumption.\u201d Tears of the Sun (2003) Tagline: \u201cHe was trained to follow orders. He became a hero by defying them.\u201d     Tears of the Sun trailer   Bruce Willis plays a US navy Seal sent to rescue Monica Bellucci\u2019s brave doctor from her jungle hospital in war-torn Nigeria. Will he obey his orders? Will Bellucci prevail on him to protect her patients? Do you really need to ask? The Constant Gardener (2005)  Tagline: \u201cLove. At any cost.\u201d     Unwavering \u2026 Ralph Fiennes in Fernando Meirelles\u2019 2005 Le Carr\u00e9 adaptation, The Constant Gardener. Photograph: Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock    Fernando Meirelles, director of City of God, helms the big-screen version of John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s novel about a diffident diplomat (Ralph Fiennes) trying to find out how his activist wife (Rachel Weisz) came to be murdered in Kenya. More about evils of big pharma than diligent horticulture. Machine Gun Preacher (2011) Tagline: \u201cHope is the greatest weapon of all.\u201d     Machine Gun Preacher trailer   Gerard Butler stars in this biopic of Sam Childers, a troubled drug-dealing LA biker who converts to Christianity and heads to Sudan to build orphanages and kick bad-guy arse. As the title suggests, Childers is of an Old Testament bent and not averse to using small arms \u2013 or indeed heavy weaponry \u2013 when it comes to spreading the word of the Lord. Beasts of No Nation (2015) Tagline: \u201cChild. Captive. Killer.\u201d     Beasts of No Nation trailer   Fukunaga\u2019s adaptation of the 2005 novel by the Nigerian-American author Uzodinma Iweala features Idris Elba as the charismatic, maniacal Commandant who twists children into soldiers in an imaginary west African country. Netflix paid $12m (\u00a37.8m) for the worldwide rights to the film, which was snubbed at this year\u2019s Oscars.     Sean Penn in The Gunman, from the director of Taken. Shame it wasn\u2019t.    The Gunman (2015)  Tagline: \u201cArmed with the truth.\u201d Sean Penn plays Jim Terrier, a troubled mercenary-turned-NGO-well-digger-turned-man-on-the-run in a thriller from the director of Taken. Disappointingly, it\u2019s never revealed whether he has a brother called Jack Russell. But he does surf.  Any other examples of humanitarian crises on the big screen?
