McCain also pleaded on Thursday with the next president \u2013 be it Trump or Democratic rival Hillary Clinton \u2013 to surround themselves with national security experts including David Petraeus, the wartime general who last year pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information. Responding to a question from the Guardian at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, McCain said: \u201cAs far as Mr Trump\u2019s views are concerned, I\u2019m not exactly sure what some of his views are because sometimes he makes contradictory statements. \u201cI agree with him to this extent, that our Nato allies should pay more and I\u2019ve been urging all of that, all of us have, for years and years. But let\u2019s not forget that after 9/11, the United States of America was attacked, Europeans weren\u2019t attacked, and yet we invoked Article 5 and all those European countries came to our aid and sent troops to Afghanistan.\u201d   Related: Who supports Donald Trump? The new Republican center of gravity    The Arizona senator added: \u201cYou know, over a thousand of those Nato troops, non-Americans, were killed and several thousand wounded? So maybe we also ought to show some appreciation for what our Nato allies did for us in Afghanistan.\u201d Trump, the Republicans\u2019 presumptive nominee, has previously accused Nato allies of \u201cripping off the United States\u201d and called on them to pay back their share. \u201cAnd if it breaks up Nato, it breaks up Nato,\u201d he once shrugged. His other surprise foreign policy pronouncements have included allowing Japan and South Korea to obtain nuclear weapons, saying he would have \u201cno problem\u201d speaking with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and predicting that he would not have a good relationship with British prime minister David Cameron. These have drawn criticism, including from Republican stalwarts such as Robert Gates, the former defense secretary; James Baker, the ex-secretary of state; and Michael Hayden, the former director of the CIA. Clinton told CNN this week that Trump was \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be commander in chief. But in an ongoing effort to challenge such perceptions and gain gravitas, Trump this week met Henry Kissinger, the 92-year-old former secretary of state and joint winner of the 1973 Nobel peace prize. On Thursday McCain said with a wry smile: \u201cAll I can say is that I understand Mr Trump met with Henry Kissinger. That is one meeting I am sorry I was not able to sit in on.\u201d There has been no love lost between McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and Trump since the latter remarked: \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d At the gathering in Washington, McCain could hardly have been described as a cheerleader for his fellow Republican, offering a fairly even-handed assessment of him and Clinton. \u201cObviously I have significant disagreements with Mr Trump on a number of issues. I also have some disagreements with Secretary Clinton as well. One of my disappointments, and I say very frankly to all my friends, is Secretary Clinton\u2019s switch on the issue of TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership]. I think a devastating blow to us and Asia would be failure to enact TPP.\u201d The senator, who lost the 2008 election to Barack Obama, continued: \u201cHere\u2019s my hope and I ask this of both candidates. I hope that you would sit down and bring in some of the finest military and diplomatic leaders that this country has ever been graced with. David Petraeus. Ryan Crocker. Jim Mattis. John Allen\u2019s a great leader in Afghanistan. \u201cI would recommend either to Hillary Clinton or to Donald Trump, call in these smart people; they\u2019ve lived it for the last 15 years, some of them as junior officers and some of them as junior diplomats, and they can give you the advice and counsel you need to shape a national security strategy. That\u2019s why one of my disappointments about this administration is that they haven\u2019t called in those people.\u201d Most of McCain\u2019s hour-long session was devoted to the 2017 National Defense Authorisation Act, which was approved last week by a Senate committee. He issued a stark warning of a \u201cdangerous mismatch\u201d between growing worldwide threats. \u201cEach of our military services remains underfunded, undersized and unready to meet current and future threats,\u201d he said.  Military personnel are being forced to cannibalise parts from old aircraft to keep combat planes flying, he added. \u201cWe are at risk of losing the military technological dominance that we have taken for granted for 30 years.\u201d McCain noted that the current military chiefs of staff, when asked to name the greatest security threat to America, named Russia, not Islamic State, a view that he agrees with. He pledged to fight for more funding on the Senate floor and said he would push for a reduction in the size of the White House\u2019s National Security Council. As he left the building, McCain was asked if he fully endorses Trump for the Republican nomination. He told the Guardian: \u201cI support the nominee.\u201d",
