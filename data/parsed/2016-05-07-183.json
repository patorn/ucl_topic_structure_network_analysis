  "body": "Good news for shoppers: supermarket giants Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have cut the price of a basket of basic household goods by 12%-13% over the past four years, Guardian Money can reveal. Sainsbury\u2019s this week blamed price deflation for a slide in profits, saying that the cost of goods in its stores has fallen on average by 4% over the past two years. But Guardian Money research, comparing prices in 2012 with today, shows that the falls have been even sharper, with basics such as bread, eggs and milk all down markedly. Eggs in particular have collapsed in price, from around \u00a31.48 for six to just 85p. In Money\u2019s basket of goods, we found every single item has fallen in price over the past four years, apart from one or two items at some supermarkets which were on special promotion when we first researched prices in 2012. But some price falls appear better than they really are, as manufacturers have also shrunk product sizes. For example, Jordans fruit and nut muesli (forgive us, this is the Guardian, we had to include muesli) was \u00a33.39 in March 2012 in most big supermarkets, but back then its pack size was 750g. Today it is priced at \u00a32.79 a box \u2013 which looks like a healthy saving until you see that Jordans has shrunk the pack size to 620g. Similarly, the standard Pampers size 4 pack has come down from around \u00a36.50 to \u00a35 \u2013 but the number of nappies inside has been clipped from 30 to 25. We carried out our research using the website mySupermarket, and it confirmed this week that on a broader scale, prices have been falling. Since December 2014 it has run a groceries tracker, which looks at categories of goods rather than individual products. In the year and a half it\u2019s been running, of the 35 categories only two have had price rises: pasta and frozen chips \u2013 and then only by a few pence. The biggest fall has been in broccoli (down 59%), but that may be due to seasonal factors, while fresh chicken pieces are down 13%. \u201cOverall, shoppers are 4.5% better off than they were a year ago,\u201d says mySupermarket\u2019s Kim Ludlow. It\u2019s not just food prices that are falling. The British Retail Consortium said this week that prices in shops \u2013 food and non-food \u2013 have fallen for 36 consecutive months. Deflation in non-food, running at 2.9% a year, is even deeper than that for food, led by continued falls in the price of clothing. Here are our findings, based on specific product prices in March 2012 compared to this week figures collated from mySupermarket searches and store visits. Eggs \u2013 down 43%      Six own-brand medium-sized free range eggs now cost just 85p in Asda and 89p at Tesco, compared to \u00a31.48 in 2012. But while that\u2019s egg-cellent for shoppers, it\u2019s bad news for farmers \u2013 and cooped-up hens. The collapse in egg prices is threatening to bankrupt producers in the same way that the milk price war has battered dairy farmers. Rising egg consumption \u2013 now that salmonella and cholesterol fears have subsided \u2013 encouraged egg producers to invest, with the \u201cnational flock\u201d of hens rising from 36 million to 38 million, but farm-gate prices have fallen steeply. The very cheapest eggs in the supermarkets (boxes of six can sell for as little as 50p) also encourage further intensification of caged production methods. On average, farmers receive around 48p for six eggs. Free-range eggs are now the most popular choice among British consumers (we eat around 12bn eggs a year) but more intensively farmed eggs are still a large portion of the market \u2013 and organic ones make up just 2.5% of all the eggs that are sold. Bread \u2013 down 29%       We tested the price of Hovis medium-sliced wholemeal bread (the 800g loaf). What we found in 2012 was that every supermarket had near identical prices: \u00a31.25, or two for \u00a32. Now the price has fallen to just 89p at Tesco, Asda and Waitrose, and \u00a31 at Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons (which also has a two for \u00a31.50 deal). Global wheat prices have fallen heavily in recent years, from around $8.50 a bushel in 2013 to $4.60 now. Milk \u2013 down 15%      Despite widespread protests from dairy farmers, milk prices in the supermarket have continued to fall. Four years ago a two-pint carton of own-brand semi-skimmed milk was 89p or 90p in all the\u00a0main supermarkets. Today it is just 75p, with the exception of Waitrose where it is still 89p. Waitrose says: \u201cWe believe it is important our farmers receive a fair price that gives them a sustainable return.\u201d Cheese \u2013 down 40%      This was a difficult comparison, as we tested Cathedral City mature cheddar in 200g packs, but today it is sold in 350g packs. In 2012 this was priced at \u00a32.38 (or \u00a311.90/kg) everywhere except Asda, where it was \u00a32.17. Today it is \u00a32 for the 350g pack in Asda \u2013 just \u00a35.71/kg \u2013 and \u00a32.50 in Tesco, equivalent to \u00a37.14/kg. Mince \u2013 down 17%      We found quite a variety of price differentials between the supermarkets. We tested the price of extra lean 500g packs, which in 2012 ranged between \u00a33.05 (Ocado) and \u00a34.87 (Tesco). Now the range is from \u00a33.30 (Sainsbury\u2019s) to \u00a34.29 (Waitrose), so the trend is definitely down. Labelling has also changed: in 2012 packs were marked \u201clean\u201d or \u201cextra lean\u201d, but now packs are expressed as a percentage of fat content \u2013 from 25% down to 5%. For the purposes of comparison we checked 5% fat prices today against \u201cextra lean\u201d prices in 2012.",
