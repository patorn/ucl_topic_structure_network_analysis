  "body": "Jessy Lanza\u2019s remarkable 2013 album Pull My Hair Back debuted a strange and thrilling sound nestled between afterhours and peak time, a sort of post-pubstep, blossoming intermittently into beauty. While that album saw the Canadian singer-writer\u2019s voice float, untethered, from the pin-sharp production, her follow-up seems brasher, more memorable yet less substantial, lacking the eeriness that made her last work so compelling. Melodramatic Moroder power ballad I Talk BB, the twitching Vivica and a joyous title track build on her early promise, but too often Lanza\u2019s free-form 80s pop can\u2019t quite yoke its desire to challenge to an ability to entertain.",
