  "body": "He is the party leader who must not be named. A figure so ruinous, yet so powerful, that merely uttering his moniker could spell electoral doom for any Republican running for election this year. And yet, how can you avoid Donald Trump, the most influential person in your own party: the candidate at the top of the ticket, whose popularity \u2013 or unpopularity \u2013 will seal your own fate? For that matter, how can anyone with a pulse and a phone avoid Donald Trump? Pity the poor Republican politicians who must now decide whether to hang separately, or hang together with the dark lord who believes he could shoot a supporter on Fifth Avenue and still line up more fans behind the corpse.  In any case, Donald Trump cannot be named. In statement after statement, Republicans have adopted the fetal position while muttering something about a nameless nominee. Take Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire. A spokeswoman for the senator explained that she \u201cplans to support the nominee\u201d. But she delicately added later that the senator \u201cisn\u2019t planning to endorse anyone in this cycle\u201d.  Huh? Is it possible to support a nominee without endorsing him? Ayotte\u2019s position makes about as much sense as a foreign policy speech by the nominee himself. We can at least credit Donald Trump with unleashing a new wave of creativity in the dark arts of political pretzel-making. In case you hadn\u2019t guessed already, Ayotte (elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010) is running dead even in the polls with her Democratic challenger, Governor Maggie Hassan. At least, she was before Trump became the party leader she supports but refuses to name or endorse. Is it possible to escape the shadow of a nominee who wishes he could date his own daughter? At the same time, is it credible to pretend you don\u2019t belong to the same party? This is the exquisite torture Republican voters have now inflicted on their own elected officials. After years of supposed betrayal \u2013 either economic or through purported compromises with the enemy known as Obama \u2013 the Republican party\u2019s voters have turned on their own. The result is surely going to destroy the reputations of an entire swath of Republican officials. Here, for instance, is Nikki Haley, the South Carolina governor, denouncing Donald Trump a little more than two months ago for flirting with the racist KKK: \u201cI will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK. That is not a part of our party. That is not who we want as president. We will not allow that in our country,\u201d she declared to extended cheers and applause in Atlanta. \u201cThat is not who our Republican party is. That\u2019s not who America is\u201d. Now Haley tells reporters that while she is too busy to be Trump\u2019s vice-president, \u201cI have great respect for the will of the people, and as I have always said, I will support the Republican nominee for president.\u201d Way back in 2004, when they were running against John Kerry for president, the Republican party had a word for this kind of thing: flip-flopping. The Republican party duly sent a young staffer to each Kerry event with a giant pair of flip-flops to flap in front of Kerry\u2019s supporters. The simple, yet effective, argument was that you couldn\u2019t trust a politician who reversed himself so easily. Now the entire party wears flip-flops. Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada lamented the end of John Kasich\u2019s campaign, but gave the nominee \u2013 whom he could not bring himself to name \u2013 the kind of half-throated endorsement that could only spell doom for everyone involved. \u201cI plan to vote for the presumptive nominee although it is no secret that we do not agree on every issue,\u201d the governor posted on Facebook. \u201cElections are about making choices and the Democratic nominee is simply not an option.\u201d That\u2019s just the kind of leadership this anti-establishment electorate is looking for: a politician who supports someone he doesn\u2019t agree with. No, wait. That was another cycle. The Trump Affliction is affecting not just elected officials but those who purport to advocate for specific Republican policies. The national chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition, David Flaum, congratulated Trump for winning the nomination, even though the nominee recently said he wanted to be \u201csort of a neutral guy\u201d when it came to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \u201cAlong with the presidential race, the RJC will be working hard to hold on to our majorities in the Senate and House,\u201d Flaum said, suggesting that the majorities were in danger. \u201cIt is critical that these majorities be preserved.\u201d This is an epic moment in American politics. To find anything similar, you might have to go back to 1983 when Margaret Thatcher was heading for her second crushing victory over the socialists running Britain\u2019s Labour party at the time. \u201cThe longest suicide note in history,\u201d is how one Labour parliamentarian described his own party\u2019s election platform at the time. Well, the Republican party of 2016 has just signed up for something even more damaging, although they cannot bring themselves to mention its name in public: the most suicidal nomination in history.",
