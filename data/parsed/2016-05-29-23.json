  "body": "Steven Finn found himself looking to \u201cget into a fight\u201d on a frustrating third day with Sri Lanka in Durham, seeing it as the best way to set aside his search for form this summer. The 27-year-old fast bowler has, by his own admission, been struggling for rhythm this season after a side injury sustained during the series against South Africa interrupted a rich return to Test cricket that had reaped 23 wickets in six matches following his recall to the side during last summer\u2019s Ashes series.   Related: England\u2019s Steven Finn struggles and strains but fails to find bowling form    Finn continued this personal battle as the tourists fought back in their second innings at the Riverside \u2013 they reached 309 for five following-on \u2013 but did strike in the evening session to end Kaushal Silva\u2019s doughty 60 when the opener top-edged a hook shot amid a barrage of short deliveries. Finn said: \u201cI came out after tea trying to get into a fight and have a bit more intent on a wicket where it\u2019s not doing much for me on the length. Given my height, it can be a bit more uncomfortable.\u201d Asked if he could identify what has caused a lean summer to date, Finn replied: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find something as a bowler that makes it click, when you are searching for it \u2013 maybe I\u2019ve been doing that this summer because I\u2019ve been desperate to be in form and rhythm. \u201cI still feel I\u2019m doing a job for the team but I haven\u2019t been 100% good 100% of the time, which I was in South Africa and against Australia last summer. If you are looking for rhythm you\u2019re best doing that, getting yourself in a fight at the other end of the pitch, rather than at your own. It helps take your thought process away from the pitch.\u201d Asked if he felt backed by the England management, given they may opt to take a look at the uncapped Jake Ball in what is expected to be a dead rubber third Test at Lord\u2019s next week, Finn replied: \u201cEveryone in the dressing room backs each other. \u201cI don\u2019t feel as though it\u2019s a system that discards players if you have a couple of bad games, it rewards people who perform consistently over a period of time. It backs young people. [Head coach] Trevor Bayliss said he would rather a player gets one game too many than one too few.\u201d On the match situation, in which Sri Lanka are still 88 runs behind and England are hunting five wickets for a series win on the fourth day, he said: \u201cWe have a four-over old ball tomorrow and we have seen the new ball has done damage this series. \u201cAnd we have two of the best new ball bowlers in the world. It is a great opportunity to make early inroads. In an ideal world we would have wrapped it up today. But it was going to be tough to get 10 wickets in a day on that pitch: it\u2019s very slow and low.\u201d",
