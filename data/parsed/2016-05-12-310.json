Labour won 29 of the 60 seats at last week\u2019s assembly and it had been widely assumed its leader and the current first minister, Carwyn Jones, would head a minority government.  But though Plaid Cymru won only 12 seats it put forward its leader, Leanne Wood, forward for the first minister\u2019s job on Wednesday and thanks to support from the Conservatives and Ukip, which won seats at the assembly for the first time, the vote was tied.    Related: Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood most popular leader in Wales, says poll    The unprecedented situation leaves the assembly in limbo. Talks will take place between the parties but if no way forward is agreed, a new election may have to be called. Alun Davies, the Labour assembly member for Blaenau Gwent, said with 29 seats his party had the right and mandate to govern. He said: \u201cHow we do that is an entirely different question. We need to be more open, transparent, inclusive. We have to reach out.\u201d  Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Davies said Plaid should take a hard look at what it had done.  He said: \u201cA week ago people were told categorically by Plaid Cymru that if they voted for Plaid there would be no circumstances in which Plaid would work with or come to arrangements or understandings with either the Conservatives or Ukip. It\u2019s taken less than a week.\u201d  Plaid overtook the Tories as the second biggest party on the assembly. But Davies pointed out they still had only a fifth of the 60 seats.  He said: \u201cYesterday you saw Plaid Cymru put forward two members as presiding officer running the national assembly and then attempt to run the Welsh government as well. All that on 12 elected members. I think that smacks of an arrogance that the people of Wales simply will not tolerate.      Carwyn Jones.    \u201cI\u2019m not interested in playing these games. I\u2019m interested in delivering for the people who voted for me last week. I\u2019m interested in the future of the steel industry, in creating jobs, in investing in infrastructure. I don\u2019t want to be sitting in Cardiff Bay twiddling my thumbs, waiting for Plaid Cymru to get off their high horse.\u201d Before the election, polling put Leanne Wood as the most popular leader in Wales. A former probation officer, she was one of the star performers during last year\u2019s UK general election campaign, winning fans for slapping down Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage during a leaders\u2019 debate. Any perceived link to Ukip and the Tories now may harm her image.  Wood was not available for comment on Thursday morning.  The Plaid AM Simon Thomas said the party had acted as it did to \u201ccheck\u201d Labour. He said: \u201cWe did offer Labour the chance to delay this vote to allow for proper talks to take place. It was Labour\u2019s arrogant decision to press ahead. They assumed they would march back into government and they have been checked.  \u201cThe first thing we want to achieve is that Labour is checked and reminded that it doesn\u2019t have a majority and has to work with other parties. The second thing we want is proper discussions. We\u2019ve heard a lot of talk from Labour about their programme of government. What programme of government? They don\u2019t have a mandate simply to press ahead with their manifesto.\u201d He told BBC Radio Wales: \u201cSimply turning up at the assembly and nominating Carwyn Jones without a word over what sort of government he will be leading, what programme he will be putting together, I think that is simply not good enough and it is not respectful of all parties in the assembly.  \u201cIt\u2019s about Labour recognising that they will need the support of other parties almost on a daily basis. They can\u2019t simply expect to put together the sort of programme and arrogant and lazy government that we\u2019ve had for the last five years.\u201d  The assembly was adjourned on Wednesday following the impasse. Thomas said he did not think anyone wanted another election \u2013 the end point if no agreement can be made. He said the big political focus now ought to be keeping Wales in Europe.  Thomas said relations were tested between Plaid and Labour when a senior Labour figure described the nationalists\u2019 previous co-operation as a \u201ccheap date\u201d. \u201cI think since then we\u2019ve been keen to ensure anything we do with Labour or any other parties is really screwed down,\u201d he said.  The number of votes for Jones and Wood on Wednesday was tied on 29 each (neither the presiding officer nor the deputy votes). Had Kirsty Williams, the last remaining Liberal Democrat in the assembly, voted with Plaid and the Tories, Wood would have become the first minister despite Labour being by far the largest party. Ukip won seven seats at the assembly and by backing Wood is already making good on its promise to shake up what it sees as a \u201ccosy\u201d assembly.  Labour has led the devolved government ever since it was established, but never had a majority.  The Government of Wales Act 2006 prescribes that a first minister must be elected within 28 days of polling day or another election must be called.",
