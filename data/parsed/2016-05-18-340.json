  "body": "The lady holding my foot put on a surgical mask, donned some protective glasses and cranked up what looked like a small, electric sanding device. In a couple of minutes time, she would be splattered in blood, my toes sprayed across Carnaby Street, while I screamed for mercy. Or maybe not. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to let me know if it tickles,\u201d she said, rather un-ominously. I had been sent for a pedicure, you see, because apparently they\u2019re becoming quite the thing on the growing male beauty scene. It\u2019s all basketball\u2019s fault. In\u00a02014, NBA legend LeBron James posted pictures of him mid-pedi on Instagram with the caption: \u201cHave to take care of your dogs Men! It\u2019s part of our life blood!\u201d Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O\u2019Neal are other hoop-shooters who like to get their cuticles oiled, while David Beckham \u2013 who else? \u2013 represents footballers who love a \u201cmani-pedi\u201d. If you\u2019ve been closely following the Balmain 2016 spring/summer collection \u2013 if not, what do you even do with your free time? \u2013 you\u2019ll know that exposing your toes has hit the catwalk, too. Clearly, someone needed to investigate this phenomenon, and that someone had to be me. So I ventured to Cowshed, where a woman called Gosia made me a green tea, placed a big, fluffy cushion on my lap and got me to lower my feet \u2013 exhausted from a whole morning\u2019s music journalism \u2013 into a bucket of warm water. Beyond the fact that I was going to be miles better at basketball in an hour\u2019s time, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. \u201cWill you be wanting colour?\u201d she asked. Sensing my panic, she swiftly assured me that most men opt for a simple tidy-up instead. \u201cThe ones who want colour normally go for black,\u201d she noted. Gosia began clipping and filing away, occasionally reaching for a long, pokey thing to get under the nails. There were numerous oils and creams, but no pain and precious little drama: even the miniature sanding device proved to be harmless \u2013 a light cloud of dry skin was all that emerged. While she finished off the session with a foot rub and a nail buff, Gosia told me that most of the men who come for a pedicure do so in tandem with their partners; it\u2019s often a pre-holiday treat. That made sense. My feet definitely looked smoother and shinier, and the whole thing was as relaxing as a situation can be when a stranger is playing around with your feet. But, for \u00a355, I\u00a0think you would have to be quite committed to \u201cbeing pampered\u201d to make it a regular occurrence. And, as I put on my shoes again, I wondered who would actually see the results. For all our striving for gender equality, there is one law that must surely endure for ever: that men should never get their feet out in public. Unless, of course, it\u2019s for a national newspaper providing a vital public service.",
