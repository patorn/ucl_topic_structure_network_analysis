  "body": "This book is about choosing what you like. It is a picture book with interesting pictures \u2013 some are funny. I read the top of the page and then chose an option. It made me happy. And I liked reading it with a Dorset Reading Partner volunteer because we talked about it. The pictures made me think about my family. I liked picking what I\u2019d like to do, who I would be, and who I would like my family and friends to be. Also my home \u2013 inside I would put a chaise longue, a TV, an Xbox and I would have a microwave oven to warm things up. My favourite food is all types of fish, for pudding \u2013 chocolate bars. I also like McDonalds.      I want to travel on holiday on a speed boat. On a hot day I\u2019d have a barbeque and at Halloween I would have a pumpkin. I would wear cargo trousers and a jacket with a fringe. If I was in a hot country I would wear a grass skirt.
