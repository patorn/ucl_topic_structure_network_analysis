Invoking the 9/11 attacks, Clinton recalled the profound effect the tragedy and its aftermath had on her \u2013 from the massive loss of life to the months-long cleanup efforts. That Clinton was a senator from New York at the time is widely known, but on this Tuesday afternoon she revealed another facet of the recovery efforts that would resonate with those who had gathered to see her speak. Ironworkers, she said, had rushed to the scene from all over New York and New Jersey in the hopes that their skills would be of help in the search for victims. \u201cSadly, there weren\u2019t very many people to be rescued. People either died or escaped,\u201d Clinton said.    You are very human. I don't care what they say    But the ironworkers stayed on the piles of debris for months, she added, helping to clear the steel beams off the site while breathing in toxic air at great personal cost. Clinton, who worked toward securing healthcare for them and the many other first responders, recounted how one of the ironworkers took a piece of burnt steel from the pile and made her a cross, now one of her \u201cprized personal possessions\u201d. It was a sober moment in a speech focused on Clinton\u2019s plans to boost manufacturing jobs in the US, but also a glimpse at how a candidate long portrayed as less than personable and rather brittle looks to connect with voters on the campaign trail.  Clinton has herself acknowledged that she is not a natural campaigner like her husband Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. But while she has been on the trail, highlighting a wide range of issues, Clinton has relied on her decades of public service to prove that she has not simply witnessed the problems that plague many Americans but, in many ways, personally experienced them through those she has met along the way. In Connecticut, whose primary she won last month, it was through a roundtable with relatives of gun violence victims roughly an hour away from the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, where 20 children and six adults were massacred in 2012. Explaining why she was so passionate about the issue, Clinton, a longtime advocate of stricter gun laws, said she had simply been in too many rooms with too many families who had lost a loved one over the last 20 years.

I don\u2019t care what they say, but you are very human.\u201d Leading up to the New York primary, where Clinton overwhelmingly defeated Sanders on 19 April, she pursued low-key opportunities to engage with voters on a more personal basis. From a senior center in East Harlem that predominantly cares for Latinos to a block party in the Bronx, Clinton mostly eschewed large rallies in favor of smaller crowds at which she could tailor her message to fit their concerns \u2013 ranging from the Puerto Rican debt crisis to criminal justice reform. Her apparent deep-rooted understanding of constituents from every corner of New York was, once more, the byproduct of Clinton\u2019s personal experience serving two terms on its behalf in the Senate. The Democratic primary season has been most notable for the passion and the sheer sea of humanity drawn to her rival Bernie Sanders\u2019 potent rallies. Yet Clinton\u2019s ability to connect with voters has paid dividends and solidified her standing in recent weeks as the likely nominee. The Vermont senator has vowed to press on but seems to lack a plausible path in the face of Clinton\u2019s seemingly insurmountable lead in the race for the 2,383 delegates required to clinch the nomination. Clinton\u2019s campaign, increasingly confident after weathering a drawn-out and at times torrid primary, has already begun to pivot toward the general election. And it is in the months leading up to November that Clinton\u2019s \u201crelatability\u201d will truly be put to the test. Her favorability ratings are ostensibly lower in polling conducted of the wider general electorate.  Her approval numbers have taken a hit among independents in particular, and questions remain over whether she can win over rural, working-class white voters. This week, Clinton embarked on a two-day swing from Kentucky to West Virginia, ending at the south-eastern Ohio border, with a focus on jobs and the economy. In keeping with the strategy employed by her campaign thus far, Clinton again sought out opportunities to get up close and personal with the voters whose support she will need in forthcoming primaries and down the road in November. At an Italian restaurant in Ashland, Kentucky, Clinton listened intently during a private lunch with steelworkers and 20 local economic leaders about concerns related to the manufacturing industry. She also addressed the demise of the coal industry, deeming it to be a \u201ctragedy\u201d for the many parts of Appalachia that have incurred thousands of job losses as a result.

Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters    \u201cI think we owe people in this part of the country a lot, and I don\u2019t want to walk away,\u201d Clinton said. The Appalachia region, described as Trump country, is arguably hostile terrain for Clinton, but her campaign has pledged to reach out even to those who may not vote for her. That Clinton rounded off the trip in Ohio, a critical battleground in the general election, offered yet another sign that she is shifting gears toward November. And it looks increasingly likely that she will face Donald Trump \u2013 the GOP frontrunner who may be dominating the Republican race but has historic levels of unpopularity among key demographics, including women and Latinos. Clinton has routinely drawn a contrast with Trump while condemning his statements about immigrants and Muslims. But last week, things again became personal when Trump accused Clinton of \u201cplaying the woman\u2019s card\u201d to get ahead and insinuated it was the only reason she had been successful thus far. Clinton\u2019s campaign responded with a \u201cWoman Card\u201d for supporters to purchase \u2013 complete with a \u201cDeal me in!\u201d slogan. The tactic raised $2.4m in just three days \u2013 40% of which, aides said, came from first-time donors.  It is through outbursts such as these, which have come to be expected from Trump, that Clinton\u2019s campaign believes there is an opportunity to reach out to voters she has dubbed as \u201cthoughtful Republicans\u201d. Clinton has not, however, cast Sanders away entirely, even while engaging Trump in a potential preview of the fight to come. In her recent victory speeches on key primary nights, Clinton has sought to remind his legion of supporters that ultimately, they share a common set of priorities for the direction of the country. \u201cThere\u2019s much more that unites us than divides us,\u201d Clinton told them. However, some polling has shown resistance among Sanders supporters to rallying around her candidacy \u2013 and in an election in which turnout could be a decisive factor, her ability to connect will be hugely significant. But it is familiar terrain for Clinton, whose own supporters in 2008 were similarly reticent to back Barack Obama when the wounds of the primary remained fresh. The party ultimately came together, in part due to Clinton\u2019s own aggressive campaigning on Obama\u2019s behalf after conceding the race.   Related: Who will Hillary Clinton's running mate be? Here are some ideas    Asked at a recent town hall if he would encourage his followers to support Clinton if she were the nominee, Sanders was noticeably coy and indicated he had little control of the matter. There is ample time, of course, for Clinton to court his supporters \u2013 and the role Sanders will choose to play remains to be seen. At the White House correspondents dinner in Washington DC this weekend, Obama made light of Clinton\u2019s overtures to the young voters, in particular, who have been overwhelmingly drawn to Sanders in the Democratic primary. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit it, though \u2013 Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative that just signed up for Facebook,\u201d Obama quipped, bestowing upon her the title of \u201cAunt Hillary\u201d. \u201cDear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using this right.\u201dClinton, taking the joke in her stride, tweeted back: \u201cNice job last night. Aunt Hillary approves.\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, downplayed the suggestion that Obama had been harsh on the former opponent he deemed \u201clikable enough\u201d in a 2008 Democratic debate. Earnest instead emphasized Obama\u2019s reference during the dinner about turning over the podium to the next president, \u201cno matter who she is\u201d. Clinton\u2019s allies have often pointed to her unparalleled time in the public eye \u2013 as a former first lady, two-term senator and secretary of state \u2013 when confronted with questions surrounding overall perception of her. Indeed, no other candidate is as well known, nor has anyone else been at the receiving end of two decades\u2019 worth of attacks from opponents. As Karen Finney, a campaign spokeswoman, put it shortly after Clinton launched her second presidential bid last year: \u201cShe is one of the most unknown well-known people.\u201d To counter the pre-baked narratives, Clinton has focused her efforts on listening directly to voters, state by state, as she seeks to convince them that she is best positioned to address the concerns that keep them up at night. On Tuesday, she arrived in Charleston, West Virginia, to hold a discussion on substance abuse and promote her proposed $10bn initiative to combat drug and alcohol addiction. It was another campaign stop in which Clinton, rather than simply offering her stump speech, found a way to localize a prominent piece of her platform.  Addressing voters in a state that is a center of the nation\u2019s opioid and heroin epidemic, Clinton said she and her husband had lost five friends to overdoses. She also embraced a plan by the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin to impose a one-cent tax on prescription opioid pain pills. Manchin pointed out that Clinton could have been anywhere.  \u201cBut she came here,\u201d he said. \u201cShe cares. It\u2019s a state that\u2019s going to be very difficult for her, but she cares.\u201d   Democratic delegate count",
