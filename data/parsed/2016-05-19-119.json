  "body": "Veteran MP and David Cameron-botherer Dennis Skinner is belting out\u00a0Roll Out the Barrel at the top of his voice, backed by a group of dementia patients. It\u2019s loud, joyous and full of life. In Radio 2\u2019s Dennis Skinner vs Dementia, he talks to Jeremy Vine about his fears and hopes around the disease. Skinner\u2019s mother and sister had dementia, and he worries he\u2019ll be struck down, too. At 84, he\u2019s razor-sharp: reeling powerful speeches off the top of his head and doing killer sudoku every day. If anyone is proof that keeping your brain engaged is a good thing, it\u2019s the Beast of Bolsover. Part of the station\u2019s excellent mental health week, Skinner\u2019s conversation with Jeremy Vine recalls his life story, as well as his experiences trying to relate to his mother as she slipped away. There\u2019s so much warmth, humour and common sense in everything he says, and he has the sort of compassion that should be compulsory among MPs. It\u2019s wonderful to hear him talk about his early career as a miner and becoming an MP. \u201cYou don\u2019t enter politics when you come to parliament,\u201d he says. \u201cI was getting politics for breakfast, dinner and tea when I was a little kid.\u201d As a child, he\u2019d have arguments on the street about whether the monarchy really were people with blue blood. But his fondest childhood memory is of his mum singing Gracie Fields songs as she did the housework. Later, in the grip of dementia, she didn\u2019t even recognise him, but she would still join in when he sang to her. The rest of the family were sceptical until they witnessed her singing along to one of his Desert Island Discs. Now Skinner sings \u201cwhen parliament\u2019s not in session or when I\u2019ve been kicked out\u201d. Dr Ian Le Guillou from the Alzheimer\u2019s Society backs up Skinner\u2019s theory: songs can bring back happy memories and make patients feel empowered and engaged. Old songs really are the best. \u201cThe short-term memory is one of the first things to go, because it\u2019s not so ingrained in the brain,\u201d he says. There\u2019s no known cure for dementia, so if something as simple as a sing-song helps, it has to be worth a try.",
