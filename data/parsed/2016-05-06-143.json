  "body": "My adult son is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, who has a serious eating disorder. When he first met her she was slim but healthy. Unbeknown to him, she had recently recovered from anorexia. Sadly, over the past few years, the anorexia has returned and she is now extremely frail and underweight. She has recently committed to an inpatient plan but it will be a long process and she is still entrenched in her eating habits and resistant to change, despite having had therapy for almost a year. I am very hopeful that she will be successful, but if she isn\u2019t I worry how this will affect him. I know that recovery from anorexia is a long and painful process and inevitably her illness will have a great impact on both their lives. Although her friends and family are supportive, he is the one who sees her every day and has to watch her starve herself, which must be very painful. I don\u2019t often see him on his own and try not to talk about it too much as he seems to prefer to deal with it by pretending it\u2019s not happening and making elaborate travel and holiday plans for the two of them, which seems to me a form of escapism. I suggested he might want therapy or to go to a support group but he says he has a few good friends he can speak to if necessary.  Outwardly, he seems to be coping but I sense his worry and think he is too young to be dealing with this complicated mental illness on his own. I don\u2019t want to interfere and alienate them both. I am very fond of his girlfriend and would love to see them both happy and well.  I feel so sad for both of them but, as a mother, I worry about my son, my instinct is to warn him of the responsibility he is taking on and the possibility of his girlfriend never getting well, with all the implications that will have for their life together. What advice should I give him and how much should I get involved? You are being very sensitive and caring, but I can see this is a real concern for you, for valid reasons. Anorexia is a particularly tenacious mental illness. The mention of the fact that he didn\u2019t know she had anorexia before he got involved, makes me wonder if you feel\u00a0he wouldn\u2019t have got involved had he known. I consulted Dr Jane Morris, a consultant psychiatrist at the Royal Cornhill Hospital in Aberdeen and a specialist in eating disorders (rcpsych.ac.uk). She feels that the problem facing you is multi-layered and that you need to consider whether \u201cyour well-meaning advice is likely to inflame the situation and whether you may regret it if it is reported to your son\u2019s girlfriend\u201d. Morris feels it is crucial to \u201cmaintain an attitude of proper compassion towards the girl \u2013 her illness can certainly pose a threat to her own health and happiness, and to that of those who love her, but anorexia is an illness, not a crime\u201d. But, of course, he is your son and while it\u2019s great that he is so caring and compassionate, I suspect you fear the burden may be too great. Whatever you do, don\u2019t make him defensive. Try very hard to support without judgment \u2013 he is far more likely to come to you with problems if you can do this. If he becomes defensive he may be driven to prove he can make it work, even when \u2013 or if \u2013 it becomes unworkable for him. \u201cMuch depends on how severe his girlfriend\u2019s illness is,\u201d says Morris, \u201cand the availability of and response to the best treatment and how long she\u00a0remains ill.\u201d I\u2019m sure you know how serious anorexia is and how pernicious its effects are on all concerned. \u201cBut,\u201d says Morris, \u201cwhile we should never underestimate the power of an eating disorder, recovery from anorexia is possible \u2013 about a third of sufferers recover fully and my team often point out that the finding of a boyfriend is often an important step in such recovery and a strong motivation to stay well. \u201cWe also meet with women whose husband or partner has felt obliged to tolerate the demands of the illness (loving parents often find themselves in the same situation), but when they are encouraged to behave in ways that support the patient, while rejecting the\u00a0demands of the illness, recovery at last becomes a possibility. This is the basis of a therapy pioneered by Professor Cindy Bulik. She calls it Ucan \u2013 Uniting Couples in the treatment of Anorexia Nervosa.\u201d Morris recommends Janet Treasure\u2019s book, Skills-based Learning for Caring for a Loved One with an Eating Disorder: The New Maudsley Method. She also suggests, if at all possible, that you to get to know \u201cthe girl outside of her eating disorder\u201d. All of this said, if your son really doesn\u2019t want to talk about it then you can\u2019t make him. But you can support him in other ways. And be there for him. Things change. His girlfriend may \u2013 we hope \u2013 get better. If you can manage to maintain a quietly supportive role, he will know where you are if he needs you. It isn\u2019t going to be easy, so try to get some support for yourself, too.
