  "body": "This is such a beautiful book. It is very easy to read and doesn\u2019t have lots of big words that you have to use a dictionary to look up, but it isn\u2019t simplistic either. It is about an orphan girl called Maia who longs for a real family and then she finds some distant relatives in the Amazon. She is really excited about meeting them but let\u2019s just say that they are not what she expects. She has adventures in the Amazon and makes lots of friends. I won\u2019t tell you if she is sent back to England or not. You will have to read it to find out! The characters are really lovely and the descriptions of the scenery are very vivid. They made me want to travel in the Amazon with Maia!          The book is easy to start reading, but then you get to a point in the middle where you just can\u2019t put the book down. I could easily read this over and over, but I should like to read more Eva Ibbotson books.  Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop  Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read?
