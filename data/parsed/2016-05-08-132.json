  "body": "Two years ago, exhausted by the frantic pressures of commercial portraiture, photographer Levon Biss was searching for a way to relax. His son Sebastian, then six, found the answer in their back garden. \u201cMy boy likes insects,\u201d says Biss. \u201cHe\u2019s always in the garden trying to find them and play with them. I started shooting insects he\u2019d caught, so that he could see them clearly and be proud of finding them.\u201d Making detailed portraits of insect specimens proved to be the perfect antidote to the trigger-happy, \u201cdisposable\u201d photography that Biss feels is the current fashion. \u201cI wanted a project that made me think, that was a challenge,\u201d he says, and he gradually developed a technique so specialised and laborious, only a photographer of extreme patience and dedication could sustain it. First, the pinned insect is mounted on an adapted microscope-stand in front of a camera with a macro lens. Biss then divides the insect into 30 sections, to be photographed separately at close range. \u201cWhen you get to this magnification,\u201d he explains, \u201cthe depth of field is so shallow, there\u2019s only a minute plane of focus.\u201d To render, for instance, a whole wing-casing in focus, it must be photographed around 750 times, with each photo taken 10 microns apart. Those 750 images are then painstakingly compiled into a composite, using a variety of sophisticated software.     A Splendid-Necked Dung Beetle Photograph: Levon Biss    Finally, the 30 sections must be combined, which poses its own problems. \u201cBecause of the contours of an eye,\u201d says Biss, \u201cit has to be lit completely differently to a hairy leg or an antenna\u201d, which means the sections have to be carefully sewn together, allowing for divergences in colour and perspective. \u201cThe process for me is as much a part of it as the final image,\u201d says Biss. It is fortunate that he feels this way: each minutely detailed final portrait is the product of 8,000 individual photographs and at least three weeks\u2019 work.   Related: 50 Years of Wildlife Photographer of the Year \u2013 in pictures    When the garden failed to yield sufficient new subjects, Biss sent a speculative email to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, asking for help. \u201cI was immediately sold,\u201d says Dr James Hogan, an entomologist at the museum. \u201cHe had the pictures on his laptop and he just kept zooming in and zooming in.\u201d Hogan was astounded not only by the level of detail but also the creative way the insects had been exposed: \u201cScientific specimens tend to be very plainly lit, whereas Levon has really brought them alive, and created insect portraits.\u201d Hogan delved into the museum\u2019s 5m-strong collection of pinned insects, sending Biss home with creatures such as the splendid-necked dung beetle and the branch-backed treehopper; specimens the public rarely gets to see. Biss has now completed more than 20 insect portraits, huge three-metre prints of which will be exhibited at the museum from 27 May. Aside from the photographs\u2019 unearthly beauty, they also have legitimate scientific merits. Since many of the insects are barely more than a centimetre in length, the finer details of their textured surfaces could never be visible to the naked eye. The entomological term for this texture is \u201cmicrosculpture\u201d \u2013 also the name Biss has given the project \u2013 and the most arresting aspect of the series is the tactile landscape of the insects\u2019 bodies when seen at close range.     A Branch-Backed Treehopper Photograph: Levon Biss    \u201cUntil you see them up close \u2013 I mean really up close,\u201d says Biss, \u201cyou\u2019ve got no idea that each of the fine hairs on a blowfly\u2019s wings is a different shape, or that the common ground beetle has perfectly geometric hexagonal dimples all over it.\u201d Biss was particularly enthralled to learn that the vivid colours of the insects are not due to a pigment, which could fade, but the refraction of light off their delicately textured surfaces. \u201cI like that cross-over \u2013 the microsculpture and the colour are linked,\u201d he says. \u201cI was working on a tri-coloured jewel beetle the other day that was collected by AR Wallace \u2013 a contemporary of Darwin\u2019s. This insect is 160 years old, and it\u2019s full of colour.\u201d Photographer and entomologist have different preferences among the photographs. Biss favours the orchid cuckoo bee, for the visual impact of its vivid greens, while Hogan has a soft spot for the Marion flightless moth \u2013 an extremely esoteric creature from the subantarctic Indian ocean that lives on the detritus that accumulates in albatross nests. The project isn\u2019t over, however: \u201cI haven\u2019t shot an insect for a month or so, and James said, \u2018Are you ready to go again?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s go for it.\u2019\u201d First, though, Biss will see his private project exhibited on a very public scale, an experience that Sebastian, now eight, is relishing. \u201cHe\u2019s proud, because he thinks it\u2019s him that started this whole thing up \u2013 which it was,\u201d says Biss. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking him to the exhibition; that\u2019ll be quite a sweet moment, I think.\u201d Microsculpture will be exhibited at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History from 27 May to 30 October, with a photography workshop from Levon Biss on 9 July",
