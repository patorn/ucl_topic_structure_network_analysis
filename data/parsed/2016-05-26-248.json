  "body": "Maline Hairup was a devout Mormon. No alcohol, no coffee. She didn\u2019t smoke. Until the day she died, she had never used illegal drugs. Yet she was an addict for most of her adult life. \u201cMaline never thought she had a problem,\u201d said her sister, Mindy Vincent, a recovering addict. \u201cShe was a firm believer that because the doctor prescribed the pills it was OK. She didn\u2019t see any shame in it. She didn\u2019t think she was an addict. It wasn\u2019t like taking drugs. But she was on the painkillers for 15 years until they wouldn\u2019t give her any more. \u201cShe eventually ended up getting some heroin because she couldn\u2019t get any more pills. My sister used heroin one time and she died.\u201d In 2014, the year Hairup died at age 38, one-third of adults in Utah had a prescription for opioid painkillers, most notably a powerful opiate at the heart of the crisis, OxyContin. Many of them were among the 65% of state residents who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or Mormons. Sometimes, opioids take hold of several members of the same family. Hairup\u2019s father is dependent on prescription painkillers and her brother\u2019s addiction to prescription opioids set him on the path to heroin.   Opiates in America interactive teaser   One person dies each day in the state from a prescription drug overdose, a 400% increase since 2000, according to the Utah health department. The toll rises by half again when deaths from heroin are included. The US attorney in Salt Lake City, John Huber, last month warned of \u201can insatiable appetite in Utah for pain pills and for heroin\u201d. Many of the recorded deaths are of people who became hooked on prescriptions for sports or work injuries, or to cope with chronic conditions such as back pain. But there has also been widespread use among Mormons who some LDS church members say fall back on opioid painkillers as a crutch to cope with pressure to live a devout life. \u201cWe have a catastrophe now in Utah with opiate overdoses,\u201d said Dan Snarr, a member of the high priest group leadership within the LDS church whose son, Denver, died of a prescription drug overdose at the age of 25 after becoming hooked on painkillers following a rugby injury.  \u201cThe LDS church is a big part of it. I go to church every week and I see where the challenge is. They make people feel that they should be perfect and they feel inferior, like they can\u2019t live up to the standards of what they expect them to live up to. So they start using prescription painkillers not to address pain, physical pain, but the mental issues that go along with feeling inferior. That you just cannot cope with all the things you\u2019re expected to be and to do.\u201d Snarr, who is also a former mayor of the small town of Murray in Salt Lake County, said he realised the scale of the problem when other Mormons came to him after Denver\u2019s death to speak about their own families and addiction. \u201cA lot of people recognise that it\u2019s beyond anything to do with pain. It alleviates the stress and pain of this life and the challenges that you face,\u201d he said.     Maline Hairup. Photograph: George Frey for the Guardian    Snarr has spoken openly in his church about the crisis, to the frustration of some LDS leaders who, he said, prefer to keep hidden what they regard as moral failings. Vincent, who works as a counsellor at a treatment centre, First Step House, said her sister was initially prescribed opioids for pancreatitis and migraines. The drug swiftly became a mental and emotional dependency that Hairup regarded as legitimate because it was prescribed by doctors and did not conflict with her religion. \u201cI think my sister found the medication helped with the physical pain but it also eased emotional pain,\u201d said Vincent. \u201cIn Utah we have a phenomenon known as toxic perfectionism. There\u2019s a belief amongst members of the LDS church that you need to be perfect. It\u2019s keeping up with the Joneses times 10.\u201d Vincent said that the more her sister became dependent, the more the doctors increased the doses. \u201cDoctors prescribed Maline lots of pain medications in conjunction with Valium and antidepressants. She really believed that he was taking it for a good medical reason,\u201d she said. In recent years both Vincent\u2019s ageing father, who she describes as \u201ca super active member of the LDS church\u201d, and her brother, Stan Hairup, were prescribed opioid painkillers too \u2013 her father to deal with multiple surgeries and Stan to cope with a basketball injury.  \u201cBefore you knew it, my brother, my dad and my sister were all sharing pills. They look at that like that\u2019s normal and OK because it was prescribed but the prescriptions weren\u2019t for each other,\u201d she said. Carol Moss, a Mormon and Democratic state legislator, also said religion is a factor in the spread of opioid addiction. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique about Utah is that the LDS church forbids alcohol and tobacco. People around the world have a drink to relax or drink socially,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen those things are not part of the cultural acceptance for people, they look for an acceptable palliative for aches and pains and depression and that\u2019s become pills.\u201d \u2018You\u2019d better not neglect pain\u2019 In struggling to fathom how this epidemic swept into Utah\u2019s middle-class homes, a far cry from the popular image of drug users as down-and-outs, families grappling with the crisis first blame pharmaceutical companies and then doctors. When OxyContin came on to the market in the mid-1990s, its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, aggressively marketed it as a powerful painkiller with little risk of addiction. Within five years, the company sold more than $1bn worth of the pills. But some patients quickly became hooked, and the pills could be ground down to create an even stronger high. Purdue was penalised $634m by a federal court in 2007 for misrepresenting the drug\u2019s addictiveness.   Related: How cracking down on America's painkiller capital led to a heroin crisis    The company reached a $24m settlement with Kentucky in December after the state sued Purdue, claiming to have \u201clost an entire generation\u201d to OxyContin. Dr Jennifer Plumb, an emergency room doctor in Salt Lake City and pediatrician who specialises in opioid addiction, said the arrival of OxyContin coincided with a federal government requirement for doctors to focus on pain as an important test of health. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t respond to it appropriately, funding got cut,\u201d said Plumb, who lost a brother to an overdose and leads a campaign for changes to the distribution of opioid painkillers. \u201cFrom the top down, physicians got told: \u2018You\u2019d better not neglect pain.\u2019 At that very same time, OxyContin turned up. Pain companies said: \u2018We\u2019ve got this miracle substance and they\u2019re not going to get addicted.\u2019 It just went absolutely nuts.\u201d Plumb said patients rarely understood the dangers.  Plumb wants to see doctors cut back on opioid prescriptions but recognises that people who are already addicted may then look to illegal drugs. Sandra Kresser thinks she put too much trust in doctors before she lost her 25-year-old son, Josh, to opioids. A doctor prescribed methadone and OxyContin after Josh injured his back at work. \u201cThat drug just grabbed hold of him. For the next two and a half years he overdosed five different times,\u201d she said. Two of those overdoses were on OxyContin.  In time, Josh also fed his addiction with heroin and cocaine, and overdosed on them too. In the end, though, it was a prescription cocktail of painkillers, an anti-anxiety drug and a muscle relaxant that killed him. \u201cHe took them exactly as prescribed,\u201d said Kresser. \u201cThose layers on top of each other just took him down.\u201d Kresser took legal action against two of the doctors who treated her son. One lost his licence to practice medicine because he was also held responsible for five other deaths. The second doctor, who wrote Josh\u2019s final prescription, was cleared by medical authorities. Snarr said that his son obtained numerous prescriptions from several doctors at once.     Dan Snarr holds a picture of his son Denver, who died of a prescription drug overdose at the age of 25. Photograph: Chris McGreal for the Guardian    \u201cDenver was doctor shopping. He was going to three at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe worked with him. He said: \u2018Dad, I think I\u2019ve figured out a way to lick it.\u2019 What he was doing was buying methadone on the street.\u201d Snarr choked up as he described the day his son died hours after telling his father how he was finally shaking his habit. \u201cWe think it was a combination of the methadone and sleeping pills that killed him. I found him,\u201d said Snarr before falling silent.  Vincent, who said her sister was also doctor shopping, hears similar stories from the addicts she counsels. \u201cIf you talk to somebody who\u2019s addicted to pain medication or heroin, they\u2019ll tell you they can always find a doctor to get whatever they want,\u201d she said. \u201cSome doctors just don\u2019t care. Then there\u2019s some who, when they have patients hounding them \u2013 saying who is the doctor to say they\u2019re not experiencing pain? \u2013 I think sometimes doctors feel trapped. They don\u2019t really have an alternative.\u201d Maline Hairup\u2019s doctor reduced her prescriptions and moved her on to Suboxone, which is used to treat addiction. Hospital emergency rooms clocked her as a drug user and she was increasingly turned away. By then, her brother, Stan, was using heroin and shared his supply. Maline\u2019s first fix killed her. \u201cAfter my sister died I totally blamed myself and I started doing more heroin I was so torn up inside,\u201d he said. But it didn\u2019t take long for Stan to see that Maline\u2019s death foretold his own. \u201cMy sister died and then two more people very close to me died. I was just like, I can\u2019t do this any more. I was so addicted that\u2019s all I ever thought about. It was just like, I\u2019m going to end up dead. So I checked myself into a methadone clinic,\u201d he said. Stan still attends the clinic and has managed to stay clean. Vincent was able to shake her own addiction to methamphetamine because she was committing a crime. Two arrests cost her custody of her son and left her homeless for a time. She says addiction is a public health issue and should be dealt with as such. But her arrests also offered a path out. \u201cTreating drug addiction as a criminal justice issue is how I was able to get into drug court and how I was able to go to treatment,\u201d she said. Growing up non-Mormon     Erin Finkbiner, left, holds her son Max Puente with her mother Jan Lovett, right. Naloxone, a reversal drug, gave Finkbiner another crack at life. Photograph: Cathy McKitrick/Standard-Examiner    The dominance of the LDS church in Utah has an impact even on those families that are not Mormon. Erin Finkbiner, who is not a member of the LDS church, was 25 when she first started experimenting with drugs. Because she has an autoimmune disease she was also able to obtain prescriptions for OxyContin by falsely telling doctors she was in pain. Her family intervened and sent her to detox, where she met the man who introduced her to heroin and methamphetamine. \u201cI started using pretty much anything I could get my hands on. I was in and out of jail,\u201d she said. Her mother, Jan Lovett, blames that in part on the difficulties of growing up as a non-Mormon in Utah. \u201cWhen she was little, Erin had people tell her: \u2018My parents won\u2019t let me play with you because you\u2019re not LDS,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cErin and my son too, both of them have lost friends to overdoses.\u201d  Finkbiner said that after she was sent to jail, and her arrest picture appeared online, she found herself shunned by friends. \u201cThe stigma\u2019s less for pain pills because it\u2019s not heroin. People don\u2019t look on pain pills like you\u2019re a junkie. In my opinion it\u2019s worse. I had a harder time with the pain pills than heroin. It was horrible,\u201d she said. Snarr sees attitudes within the church as not only contributing to the addiction crisis but as an obstacle to confronting it. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s difficult for the LDS church to admit there\u2019s a problem because they have this personification of worth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re the true church, we\u2019re perfect. But they need to recognise there\u2019s something they need to do.\u201d Although Moss, the Democratic member of the Utah legislature, said LDS church leadership has long been out of touch she has seen ordinary members become more open about the crisis in the past few years. \u201cIn church, I\u2019ve heard people talk about a son or daughter struggling with drug abuse. Those things used to be totally secret,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think there\u2019s a shift. People are less judgmental of the families involved. It\u2019s like the whole acceptance of gay individuals and marriage in that everybody knows somebody. I can\u2019t tell you how many obituaries you read \u2013 and this is really tragic \u2013 that say he struggled with his addiction.\u201d  Moss\u2019s own family is among those touched. Her stepson died four years ago at the age of 47 after years of drug and alcohol abuse.  Attitudes are changing within Utah\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature too. It endorsed a resolution sponsored by Moss declaring an opioid epidemic in the state. Legislators have passed a handful of laws to confront a crisis they previously regarded principally as a criminal issue. \u201cOne of my Republican colleagues passed a needle-exchange law,\u201d said Moss. \u201cThis would never have happened five years ago. People standing up on the floor of the house to speak in favour of the bill were some of the most conservative legislators. They all had a story like a neighbour or someone they knew of.\u201d Moss sponsored a bill which passed in 2014 to allow ordinary people to buy and carry a drug which can save the life of someone who overdoses. She wanted to get Naloxone into the hands of the relatives of those at risk and police officers who are often the first on the scene in an emergency.     Carol Spackman Moss. Photograph: Courtesy of Carol Spackman Moss    Naloxone saved Finkbiner\u2019s life, and that of the child she didn\u2019t even know she was carrying. She was just out of jail when she overdosed on heroin. An ambulance crew administered the life-saving drug. \u201cA couple of days later I got arrested again and I went to jail for more possession charges. Back in jail I found out I was pregnant,\u201d said Finkbiner, pausing as she wipes away tears. \u201cThat was what changed my mind about wanting to use drugs. I have a reason to be here. Naloxone didn\u2019t change my mind. It gave me the chance to find out I was pregnant. It gave me the chance to go to treatment. To love my son. To get my life back.\u201d So far only one Utah police department \u2013 Cottonwood Heights, a small town in Salt Lake County \u2013 has equipped officers with Naloxone. The drug was distributed last month and five days later Casey Davies became the first police officer in the state to use it. He saved the life of a 30-year-old father of two young children who overdosed on heroin. \u201cHe was dying. When I got there he wasn\u2019t breathing at all. He was blue and he had a very faint pulse,\u201d said Davies. After two doses of Naloxone, the man was on his feet. \u201cHe was sat up and walked over to the gurney when six minutes earlier he was pretty much dead,\u201d said Davies. Plumb carries Naloxone as a matter of routine and administered it to a homeless woman she spotted who had overdosed on a Salt Lake City street. But the doctor warned that while the drug saves lives, it will not end the crisis.  \u201cWe can put Naloxone in every family\u2019s hands, in every heroin user\u2019s hands, but if we continue to prescribe opioids to people at the rate we\u2019re going this will continue to grow,\u201d said Plumb. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to undo this need for a pill for every ill from America\u2019s thinking. We have to try though.\u201d",
