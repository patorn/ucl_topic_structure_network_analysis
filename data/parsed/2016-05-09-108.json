  "body": "A few months ago I promised my wife I wouldn\u2019t take on any new work for June so I could be around for our family \u2013 we had recently welcomed our third child. But then Glyndebourne called. Robin Ticciati has had to withdraw from conducting the festival\u2019s opening show to recover from a back injury. Could I conduct Meistersinger? Next month? I had to disguise my immediate reaction \u2013 pure joy \u2013 when I discussed the proposal with my wife. Of course, because she\u2019s the best partner in the world, she said: \u201cYou have to do it \u2013 go ahead.\u201d I can hardly imagine another month or period of this year, or next, where it would have been possible.    Related: Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg \u2013 review    Mind you, I once agreed with five hours\u2019 notice to conduct Siegfried at the Mariinsky theatre \u2013 an opera I had never conducted before. Compared with that, this was positively luxurious timing! I\u2019m used to jumping in, and the St Petersburg performance went well. Immediately after the show I was offered the position of permanent guest conductor.  I love all of Wagner\u2019s operas, but Die Meistersinger holds a special place in my affections. As a child I listened to it; I studied it as a student and dreamed of performing it one day. And now I have, several times. The work which \u2013 at about four and a half hours is one of the longest operas in the repertory \u2013 holds no fear for me. I have known it for such a long time that there\u2019s rarely a moment when I do not know precisely what to do. I am swimming in a lake that I know well \u2013 although sometimes a fish comes along that I have never seen before ...     \u2018This is Wagner saying\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that art should just be about following the rules\u201d.\u2019Gerald Finley as Sachs and Johannes Martin Kranzle as Beckmesser in 2011\u2019s production at Glyndebourne. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian      A conductor\u2019s approach should be like the captain of a very fast super-tanker    The first thing to consider is the mental demands. To focus for every moment of this very long piece is extremely demanding. It\u2019s the same with other big operas by Wagner, but Meistersinger is even more complex. It\u2019s a hugely rich piece full of different styles all making different demands. You have to be able to create magical moments with pianissimo and with impressionistic colours. You have to be absolutely crystal clear rhythmically. You have to be able to bring loud, full, rich sounds from the orchestra, the chorus and the soloists: sometimes all of this in the space of two or three bars only.  There is a huge amount of small values \u2013 trills, turns, acciaccatura, staccati, fast scales. There is a sometimes unbelievable counterpoint and polyphonic work, with up to 16 voices in the fugato at the end of act two. And of course not forgetting that the piece is meant to be a comedy, or as Wagner had it, a satyrspiel (a satyr play). As we know, making a good comedy work successfully is always difficult.  A conductor\u2019s approach should be like the captain of a very fast super-tanker where you have to think two or three steps ahead, so that it\u2019s always controlled and you\u2019re always anticipating what\u2019s coming next. Then there is of course musicianship \u2013 above all a conductor should be able to inspire people to make good music and to enjoy what they are doing. The moment before opening night is always rehearsal, rehearsal, rehearsal. Singers and chorus have long since learned their parts, but then \u2013 especially with such a complex piece \u2013 you have to supervise constantly. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a one-way street. Of course you should take the initiative, but nearly always there is something a singer or musician does which you like and want to take in. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because I am German, but I don\u2019t see any nationalist thread in the opera. Sure, you can find one if you think it important, but for me and my approach it is not. For me, Die Meistersinger is about art and the question of what makes an ideal artist \u2013 is it someone who knows all the rules by heart and follows them to the letter, is it someone who breaks the rules, or is it a combination of both?      Michael G\u00fcttler: \u2018I have known Meistersinger for such a long time that there\u2019s rarely a moment when I do not know precisely what to do\u2019 Photograph: Glyndebourne press office    I think, as he always did, Wagner was writing about himself. I think that somehow this is Wagner saying: \u201cI know the rules, I can write in any style to perfection, but I don\u2019t think that art should just be about following the rules.\u201d This is my first time at Glyndebourne, but I have an artistic link to the festival. I\u2019m from Dresden and went to school and university there. The conductor Fritz Busch \u2013 one of the greatest of the 20th century as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2013 was forced to leave the east German city in 1933, and went to England, and Glyndebourne, and helped found the festival. During my childhood I listened often to the three Mozart opera recordings Busch conducted here; recordings that had been given to me by a relative from in West Germany since you could not buy them in the shops in the East. I was fascinated by the idea that these people had just decided to make an opera house \u2013 how was this possible?  Now that I\u2019m here, I\u2019m finding it very inspiring. People are very focused \u2013 they want to work, to use the time well. And the environment is just beautiful. And I\u2019m glad to say that my family will be joining me in a few weeks, so that family time I promised my wife has not been entirely sacrificed.  \u2022Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg is from 21 May \u2013 27 June at Glyndebourne festival. A live recording of the 2011 production will be shown in cinemas and online on 12 July.",
