Starting with a bleary-eyed Jamie Vardy clutching a bottle of Lucozade as he left his house, the Leicester players began drifting into the club\u2019s Belvoir Drive training ground for their scheduled session at 9.30am. Manager Claudio Ranieri was mobbed by media and fans when he arrived, hailing his side\u2019s success as the highlight of his long career. Asked what his first top-flight title meant to him, the Italian replied: \u201cIt means the job is good. I\u2019m very happy now. Maybe if I had won this title at the beginning of my career I would have forgot. But now I am an old man, I can celebrate.\u201d   Related: Leicester City\u2019s title triumph: the inside story of an extraordinary season | Stuart James    Ranieri\u2019s first task will be to bring his players back down to Earth for their final two Premier League games this season. Everton are the visitors to the King Power stadium at 5.30pm on Saturday, after which captain Wes Morgan will be awarded with the Premier League trophy decorated with ribbons of blue and yellow - representing the club\u2019s colours and those of Thailand\u2019s royal house. Lifelong fan Steve Worthy, a part-time happy hardcore DJ who won a special competition organised by sponsors Barclays, will have the honour of handing the silverware to Morgan on Saturday having been presented with the trophy by former player Muzzy Izzet on Monday night. He is dedicating the experience to his 97-year-old grandmother Gladys Kenny, who was the oldest season ticket holder at the King Power, but had to retire her ticket this year due to ill health. \u201cWhen I hand the Premier League trophy to Wes Morgan I\u2019ll be thinking of my grandmother,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been a Leicester City fan since 1949 but has had to miss out on our most incredible season yet because she\u2019s not well enough to attend games. For Barclays to give our family this amazing opportunity means so much and I\u2019m hoping my grandmother will be able to join us at the King Power Stadium to experience the big moment.\u201d     Competition winner Steve Worthy (right) will present the Premier League trophy to Wes Morgan on Saturday.

Leicester will then have the chance to thank Chelsea for their stirring comeback against Tottenham on Monday which confirmed the title. Ranieri\u2019s side will be at Stamford Bridge for the final match of the season against last year\u2019s winners on Sunday 15 May, where they are expected to be welcomed on to the pitch with a guard of honour from the home side. No details of when the customary open top bus tour have yet been revealed, although it is believed that will take place after the game against Chelsea. Mayor Peter Soulsby has promised the city will celebrate for a very long time. \u201cStreet names after him [Ranieri], freedom of the city, statues \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it will be,\u201d he said. \u201cI do know we\u2019ve got quite a lot of partying ahead of us as a city to the end of the season. And then a big celebration.\u201d Soulsby added: \u201cWe know that people from all over Leicester, if not the world will want to celebrate the club\u2019s success with them, and there will be an announcement on how they can do this in due course. \u201cThey can rest assured that Leicester knows how to throw a party, and that everyone will be invited.\u201d Leicester\u2019s preparations for next season will begin at the end of July when they take part in the International Champions Cup tournament for the first time. Starting with a match against Scottish champions Celtic in Glasgow on 23 July, Ranieri\u2019s side will also play Paris Saint-Germain in Carson, USA on 30 July and Barcelona in Stockholm on 3 August.",
