  "body": "The rumoured Talking Heads reunion may be put on hold after David Byrne revealed his next project will be a musical about the life of Joan of Arc. Titled Saint Joan, the production is scheduled to premiere on 14 February 2017 in New York. In a blogpost, the musician explained that, like his 2014 musical Here Lies Love, which he created in collaboration with Fatboy Slim, it will include contemporary music with little spoken text. The music, he says, is \u201canthemic and spiritual\u201d, rather than the \u201cclubby disco grooves\u201d of his previous stage venture.    Related: David Byrne: 'The internet will suck all creative content out of the world'    The musical will be staged at the Public Theater in New York with Here Lies Love director Alex Timbers back on board, as well as a number of that show\u2019s crew members. Describing his new project, Byrne wrote: \u201cJoan\u2019s trial was the first to be so well documented \u2013 so there was a lot of that trial\u2019s testimony to draw on. (There was another trial, as well \u2013 one that involved a lot of oral history from those who knew her.) There was actually a lot of primary research to work with! On stage, imagine a singer \u2013 a contemporary young woman \u2013 backed by her inspired band, ultimately immolated at the end of her concert.\u201d Continuing to describe his fascination with the French heroine, he said:  Why has this story endured over centuries and been made into so many plays and movies? Because it\u2019s about someone \u2013 a nobody, a teenage girl \u2013 who inspired others to act, to overthrow their oppressors and take charge of their lives. She transforms from an innocent, into an androgynous warrior, and finally a martyr. Joan\u2019s story is about the power of the individual to make a difference and (for me) the hubris and sometimes oversteps that often go along with that. In other words \u2013 it\u2019s completely relevant.  Here Lies Love, a disco-musical about former first lady of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos, which was later released as an album, had an award-winning run on Broadway but was met with mixed reviews during its London production despite its three Olivier award nominations in 2015. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Billington wrote of the performance: \u201cFor all the charm of the music and the vigour of Annie-B Parson\u2019s choreography, I came out feeling that such a subject craves more complex treatment. The show doesn\u2019t shy away from the repressiveness of the Marcos regime and deftly pulls the rug away from our initial surrender to Imelda\u2019s magnetism. But, in the end, that isn\u2019t quite enough. Byrne has come up with a clever idea, but I longed for a first-rate musical dramatist to add substance to the 90-minute spectacle.\u201d",
