  "body": "Riot police used capsicum spray to separate more than 300 rival protesters after violent clashes between anti-Islam and anti-racism rallies in Coburg, in Melbourne\u2019s north. Seven men, aged between 18 and 33, were arrested during the protests, which began on Bell Street shortly after 11am on Saturday and culminated with a scrap in the grounds of the old Pentridge Prison about 12.30pm. Up to 500 police officers, including the riot squad and mounted police, attempted to separate the two groups but the protesters slipped the lines three times, resulting in brawls that involved people being kicked in the head, stomped on, and even hit with the pole of an Australian flag.

Fuck right off!\u201d   Related: Police keep anti-Islam protesters and anti-racism activists apart in Melbourne    The group then turned on to Bell Street, where a group of anti-Islamic protesters was waiting, cordoned off by riot police. Many of them also had their faces covered, some with bandanas bearing the Australian flag.

A second fight broke out near Coburg Primary school, where police again used pepper spray while other officers held people who had apparently been arrested to the side. A third fight occurred in the grounds of the old Pentridge Prison.

Two other men were arrested after being searched by police: one for allegedly carrying three knives, and the other, an 18-year-old from Gisborne, for carrying a lockpick and unspecified items that could be used for graffiti. The groups were marching in response to a planned \u201cMoreland says no to racism rally\u201d, which was to start at 11am outside the Coburg Library in Victoria Street Mall and march along Bell Street to Bridges Reserve for a \u201ccommunity speakout and entertainment\u201d. The flyer for that rally said it would protest against the closure of remote Aboriginal communities and the treatment of asylum seekers, campaign for the closure of detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru, and say no to Islamophobia.   Related: Arrests as violent clashes break out at Reclaim Australia rallies    In response, a second group, made up in part of members of the United Patriots Front and a collective called the True Blue Crew, organised an opposing rally dubbed \u201cStop the far left\u201d to counter the first rally\u2019s messages \u2013 except apparently the opposition to the closure of Aboriginal communities. The blurb on the event\u2019s Facebook page, which says it is \u201ca call to all Patriots to join this counter rally\u201d, says \u201cwe would like to make it clear that we are not rallying against our Aboriginal brothers and sisters and support them as the first Australians\u201d. It continues: \u201cwe all know that the threat of Islam is a threat to all Australians, including the indigenous community, and we will stand up to protect all of our citizens.\u201d   Related: Victorian premier asks Reclaim Australia activists: 'Why cover your face?'    Samantha Ratnam, who stood down as mayor for the City of Moreland on Friday to run as the Greens candidate for the inner-city seat of Willis, withdrew from speaking at the \u201cSay no to racism\u201d rally on Thursday, saying the risk of violence was \u201ctoo great\u201d. Businesses in the area were also warned to either close or move their footpath dining inside during the protests. It is the seventh rally involving anti-Islam protesters that has turned violent in Melbourne. The Herald Sun has reported that the cost of policing these rallies, including the ones on Saturday, stands at $1.7m.",
