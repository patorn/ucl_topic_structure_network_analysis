  "body": "1) Twenty years ago ITV thought it was ahead of the curve when it recorded a show called The X Factor. The problem was that instead of recording teenagers with sculpted hair belting out pop songs before collapsing in a puddle of their own tears when they\u2019re told they won\u2019t be getting a run at the Christmas No1 slot, this version was a hellish light-entertainment pilot in which Tom O\u2019Connor, Carol Vordeman, John Helm and Russell Grant used the football pools as a basis for some toe-curlingly bad gags and weird segments such as Grant\u2019s Astro Map. It\u2019s an hour and a half long, but it\u2019s full of gold. Score draws? The zeitgeist, right there.  2) A dutch commentator lets his emotions take over as Max Verstappen wins last weekend\u2019s Spanish grand prix. 3) You want some red-hot lacrosse action? OK then. The Boston Cannons were two points behind Rochester Rattlers with only three seconds left and the ball on their own goal-line. So what did the defender Brodie Merrill do? He scored from 80 yards to draw the game, of course.             4) Texas Rangers\u2019 second baseman Rougned Odor didn\u2019t appreciate Blue Jays\u2019 Jose Bautista sliding right through him. In fact, he got up and lamped him just to make his feelings clear. Cue mayhem in the diamond. 5) From intense baseball, we move on to intense softball. Athletic, elusive, brilliant. Yes, watch that a few times. 6) A spectacular tandem cricket catch. Highlights from last week\u2019s blog 1) Sanath Jayasuriya\u2019s 213 against England from 1998. 2) Nottingham Forest 2-5 Yeovil from the League One playoffs in 2007, including a young Wes Morgan having a shocker.         Goals! Goals! Goals!    3) Top officiating in the Czech Republic. 4) Motorcross, it\u2019s not always about who can jump highest. 5) Sometimes you eat the hole. At other times, the hole eats you.
