At the start of 2016, the good folks of the American Dialect Society got together to crown their Word of the Year. They (see what I\u2019m doing here) have decided that the word could now be used as a singular pronoun, flexing the English language so a plural could denote a singular, genderless, individual.   Related: Eight words that reveal the sexism at the heart of the English language | David Shariatmadari    They has long been used in the singular in English, but not to denote genderlessness. One of the earliest examples comes from Geoffrey Chaucer in 1395, who wrote in The Pardoner\u2019s Tale: \u201cAnd whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame, They wol come up\u2026\u201d Shakespeare followed in 1594, in The Comedy of Errors: \u201cThere\u2019s not a man I meet but doth salute me/As if I were their well-acquainted friend\u201d. It took a few centuries for they to pop up in reference to women: Jane Austen uses they in the singular 75 times in Pride and Prejudice (1813) and as Rosalind muses in 1848\u2019s Vanity Fair: \u201cA person can\u2019t help their birth.\u201d Around 1809, Samuel Taylor Coleridge rejected \u201che\u201d as the generic pronoun (\u201cin order to avoid particularising man or woman, or in order to express either sex indifferently\u201d, he wrote in his notebooks), settling on \u201cit\u201d as an ideal, neutral solution. Roughly around the same time, the philosopher John Stuart Mill was struggling to define the philosophy of language itself: what we could know \u2013 if anything \u2013 beyond our language? Mill came to the conclusion that language tells us what is thinkable, possible; so, if a young woman never sees the word \u201cshe\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d, could she naturally know that \u201che\u201d represented her, too? No. In this sense, women were inherently excluded.    If the English language had been properly organised \u2026 there would be a word which meant both \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019  AA Milne     Growing up almost two centuries later, I was just supposed to understand that language excluded me because I was a girl: I was out, except when it came to naming hurricanes and referring to ships. I was once told as a kid that all hurricanes were female because women were so destructive; a barbed comment I never questioned because at the time I already sensed some things were easier if you were a boy. These days there is an increased awareness of gender and how we define it. The ever prevalent pay gap, the high rate of male suicide. The rise of transgender celebrities: Laverne Cox, Caitlyn Jenner, the Wachowski sisters. Maria Munir, the non-binary student who came out to Obama in April. Debates about contraception, consent, masculinity, body image: so many public conversations are opening up how we define gender and its roles. But there are many insidious examples of gender divides that persist in English usage: Oxford Dictionaries defining the word \u201crabid\u201d with the example \u201ca rabid feminist\u201d or \u201chousework\u201d with \u201cshe still does all the housework\u201d \u2013 but then using the male pronoun for all examples involving doctors. There are 220 words for a sexually promiscuous woman in English, but only 20 for their male equivalents.           The moment Maria Munir told Barack Obama they were non-binary.      Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, Persian \u2013 are entirely genderless    Winnie-the-Pooh author AA Milne once wrote: \u201cIf the English language had been properly organised \u2026 there would be a word which meant both \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019, and I could write: \u2018If John or May comes, heesh will want to play tennis,\u2019 which would save a lot of trouble.\u201d And this is an English problem; the \u201call languages are this way, it\u2019s just the way of the world\u201d argument is a convenient one, but not true. While the push to use \u201cthey\u201d as a genderless pronoun is new for English, it is rather old hat in other languages: while English was picking and choosing its vocabulary from Latin and German, so many other languages \u2013 Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, Persian \u2013 are entirely genderless. The Pipil language, a language indigenous to Central America, uses a genderless pronoun \u2013 \u201cyaja\u201d \u2013 to refer to \u201che or she\u201d. Others have attempted to amend their language by borrowing from others \u2013 as Sweden did by introducing the gender-neutral \u201chen\u201d, based on \u201ch\u00e4n\u201d, meaning \u201che or she\u201d in Finnish \u2013 with varying degrees of success. Not English. In the past, I have tried solving the problem of inherent sexism in language by alternating male and female pronouns when referring to generic professions \u2013 where I refer to a patient as \u201che\u201d in one sentence, I may refer to his doctor as \u201cshe\u201d in the next. Because I\u2019m one of the rabid feminists of which Oxford Dictionaries speaks, I make certain that my generic \u201cshes\u201d are not always in positions of vulnerability. Within the last few decades, we have seen a shift in this regard: air hostesses became cabin crew, male nurses are nurses, firemen are firefighters. Women are no longer just hurricanes and boat names, and in turn, men are no longer ridiculed for working in \u2018female\u2019 professions like airplane service or nursing. These are modest but significant changes, all the more significant when you consider these terms came into practice from a deliberate drive to address outdated stereotypes. We still need deliberate effort to remove sexism \u2013 like the Washington Post\u2019s recent move from she/he to they as their default pronoun. As part of a liberal, feminist, grammar-nerd circle of friends, I had a small expectation that we would all see \u201cthey\u201d as a positive thing; what I didn\u2019t expect was fights to break out on my Facebook feed. Some friends cited jobs where they had been treated as sex objects or second-class citizens for their gender. Others recalled reading books as children about experiences they would have liked to have had, but couldn\u2019t because it was always a \u201che\u201d on the adventure. But some could not be moved: switching to \u201cthey\u201d was meaningless, changing nothing in a world where being born female could justify your being killed. Actions against actions, rather than language, made more sense. And wasn\u2019t this push for \u201cthey\u201d just an example of a new political correctness, in a time of Caitlyn Jenner and genderless bathrooms, a fuss driven by those who compulsively find offence in everything they can?   Related: Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter    In 1986, Joan Scott wrote that gender is not just about sex, but is also \u201ca primary way of signifying relationships of power\u201d: two decades since she wrote that, these battles continue. Personally, I think we should make a fuss over any use of language that excludes us by gender, race, sexuality, or religion, but I know that this is itself another issue of contention. I think \u201cthey\u201d is the way to proceed as a default, until English is spoken in a world where the inherent power disparity between the \u201ches\u201d and \u201cshes\u201d is eradicated. I know it won\u2019t happen in my lifetime, but as long as we continue to use a language that is inherently sexist, we will be forever perpetuating sexist ideology, even without intending to. I still do not know how to talk about this without inspiring fights \u2013 but it is an important one.",
