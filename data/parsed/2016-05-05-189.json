  "body": "For all that its prime focus is period-instrument performance, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, quite rightly, sees no contradiction in commissioning brand new works, and it was to the American Michael Gordon they turned for a bassoon concerto to set alongside Mozart. Appropriately, Gordon looked back to the Enlightenment for inspiration, and his neat conceit was to draw on an Anglo-American meeting of minds, namely those of scientist-philosophers Joseph Priestley and Benjamin Franklin at London\u2019s Club of Honest Whigs. Priestley\u2019s celebrated treatise on the discovery of oxygen \u2013 pace Antoine Lavoisier supporters \u2013 gave Gordon his title: Observations on Air.  Set over a pulsing double bass, the bassoon\u2019s first musings were in suitably philosophical vein, with a simple arpeggio figure constantly re-examined. Phrasing was not actually that long-breathed, but delivered with a singing tone by soloist Peter Whelan against lively string-writing and the animated interpolations of wind instruments. The central movement was a more reflective affair, and Whelan\u2019s remarkable virtuosity came into play in the fast finale, where Gordon combined all the jauntiness of a Bachian badinerie with knotty counterpoint, marrying the centuries with wit and finesse.  The second half offered further food for thought, with the eight-year-old Mozart\u2019s First Symphony set against the Clarinet Concerto written just weeks before his death. Violinist/director Matthew Truscott and clarinettist Antony Pay made this an insightful collaboration.  At St John\u2019s Smith Square, London, on 7 May. Box office: 020-7222 1061. Then touring.",
