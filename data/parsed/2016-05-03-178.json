The signs started in Germany more than 50 years ago, after a number of motor accidents in which the emergency services had rescued adults from the front of a wrecked car but had not realised there was a baby in the back. At that time there were no car seats for children, so nothing to indicate another small passenger.Martin A Smith, Oxford, UK \u2022 Spit the dummy.Roger Morrell, Perth, Western Australia, Australia \u2022 Change the baby\u2019s diaper?Philip Stigger, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada \u2022 Commiserate.Margaret Wyeth, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada \u2022 Celebrate contraception.Stuart Williams, Kampala, Uganda \u2022 Surely it\u2019s only to alert delivery vehicles?Malcolm Campbell, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia \u2022 Pass quietly.Alan Williams-Key, Madrid, Spain \u2022 Turn the music down as you overtake them.Avril Nicholas, Crafers, South Australia, Australia \u2022 I wouldn\u2019t buy it until I knew a lot more about it.Adrian Cooper, Queens Park, NSW, Australia \u2022 Never to give way to babyish road rage but to treat them with the milk of human kindness.Ursula Nixon, Bodalla, NSW, Australia \u2022 Give them as wide a birth as possible.Annie Didcott, Chifley, ACT, Australia \u2022 Make love, not war.Jennifer Horat, Lengwil, Switzerland \u2022 Perhaps to beware their distracted driving.Lawrie Bradly, Surrey Hills, Victoria, Australia That\u2019s a hard one to swallow When does a tablet become a pill?  When it becomes hard to take, as in \u201cThat\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow.\u201dRichard Orlando, Westmount, Quebec, Canada \u2022 When it stops being flat and starts being round (or oblong).Moe Malik, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada \u2022 The tablet on which Moses wrote the Ten Commandments was and still is a difficult pill to swallow.Mary O\u2019Mahoney, Crosshaven, Ireland \u2022 When it is too small to have writing on it.Tes Toop, Leopold, Victoria, Australia \u2022 When taken the morning after.R De Braganza, Kilifi, Kenya \u2022 When Apple releases a newer model.Erica Dunn, Simcoe, Ontario, Canada It\u2019s just so hard to choose What literary classic is worth the arduous task of reading it?

Most memorable were Dr Zhivago (Pasternak) and The Marriage Contract (Balzac).Dave Rose, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada \u2022 Probably Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy in the original Italian, but unfortunately I\u2019ve never got further than the first couple of pages.

By Virginia Woolf.Susan Willson, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada \u2022 In my boyhood, every issue of Classic Comics was worth the read.
