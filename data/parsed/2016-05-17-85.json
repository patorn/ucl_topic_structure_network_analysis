But this year, I\u2019ve found a far cheaper way to get heads turning: injury.   Related: Juliette Binoche: I confronted Spielberg and Scorsese over lack of female leads    On the second day of this year\u2019s festival I came off my hire bike going down a hill and the impressive flesh wounds sustained have really upped my profile on the Croisette. Want to make an entrance? Remove your sunglasses to reveal a splashy black eye, colours as dazzling a spectacle as the sunset yonder. Conversation in the queue for a movie hard-going? Tease a peek of your elbow. Need an interviewee\u2019s sympathy? That bleeding knee should do the trick. (\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve really damaged your spine,\u201d smiled Vanessa Redgrave.) Cannes is, in fact, not a great place to feel yet more grotesque than usual. The women here are, by and large, highly coiffured and upholstered, pins smooth and unbruised, complexions dewy and bronzed. They glide down for breakfast on six-inch heels. They wear frocks my granny would have rejected as dusters. They look, literally, like movie stars. Yet the experience of hobbling among goddesses has served to strengthen my scepticism about one of the chief rallying cries heard around the festival this year: for competition quotas. The mood in many quarters is that quality is not enough, that boxes must be ticked and preferential treatment offered in the name of progress. A panel on industry diversity urged those deciding the prizes in Cannes, as well as those who vote for the Baftas and Oscars, to give equal weight to considering the message sent by their choices as to quality. I know I\u2019ve had a knock to the head, but I\u2019d thought this was done and dusted. I thought everyone now conceded that by the time you get to the awards stage, it\u2019s too late. Action to address prejudice needs to come rather earlier in the production process. Remove the subjective element in the already dubious concept of arts competition, and it becomes all but redundant. Counterintuitive too: why devalue something you\u2019re holding up as important? Two years ago Steve McQueen\u2019s 12 Years a Slave won best picture at the Oscars. It did so because it was the best film of the year. It would be awful if such a victory were undermined by accusations of positive discrimination. Lots about life isn\u2019t fair. It is not fair some people are smart and some stupid; other disparities can and should be addressed. But Cannes ain\u2019t always the place to start. Fungus: not the bogeyman  Some lovely understatement by Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, author of a new report confirming that psychedelic drugs \u2013 in particular, magic mushrooms \u2013 can have a therapeutic effect on those with mental health issues. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of approach could be risky.\u201d Yet as mental healthcare is pruned hard and the price of drugs rises, foraging is certain to, well, mushroom. Of course, this can go horribly wrong, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind not only the myriad health benefits present in all mushrooms but also the serotonin rush that just rummaging on the forest floor will probably provide. Simply sniffing a handful of humus can do wonders.     Manston airport, Kent: \u2018worth a visit\u2019. Photograph: Invicta Kent Media/REX    I\u2019m Manston, fly me  Happy birthday, Manston! Thanet\u2019s beleaguered airport turns 100 in 10 days\u2019 time, and faces a more uncertain future than in all its busy history. This despite the fact it obviously ought to be where any new runway for the south-east comes, given there\u2019s one in place already, the area could do with an uplift, and building a train spur to the high-speed line would be a relative doddle. It\u2019s still worth a visit, though: terrific beans on toast among stirring aviation oil paintings in the caff, and a superb museum stuffed with planes and artefacts and peeling papier-mache models dressed in RAF gear. \u201cDo not touch,\u201d reads a sign by one rusty bomber. \u201cI am old. Treat me gently.\u201d I know the feeling.",
