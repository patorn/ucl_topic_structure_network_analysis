  "body": "Manuel Pellegrini smiles broadly, shakes hands and offers a seat at one of the desks in his office at Manchester City\u2019s first-team building. The nerve centre in which the Chilean plotted City\u2019s past three campaigns has modern lines, with sweeping windows, and is spacious. From the MacBook Air before him Pellegrini will later print off statistics to outline how dominant City were during his tenure. On the wall behind the 62-year-old hangs a miniature white pitch which features named magnetic figures denoting his squad, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Wilfried Bony and Kelechi Iheanacho heading the formation. Pellegrini has just returned from a break in Scotland with his wife. It may surprise some that this first interview since his tenure materially ended at City \u2013 his contract expires on 30 June \u2013 takes place at the club, given it will soon be commanded by Pep Guardiola. This, though, is in line with Pellegrini\u2019s relaxed demeanour, as is the absence of a City media officer. He is in expansive, honest mood. Pellegrini opens up for the first time about the decision to announce Guardiola as his successor with four months of the season left. It was his own decision and Pellegrini admits he might choose differently if given the choice again. In January Guardiola had said: \u201cI want to manage in the Premier League.\u201d This is what prompted Pellegrini and he is clear the 45-year-old\u2019s comments were ill-judged. \u201cYes, it was my decision,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter Guardiola said he was coming to England it was my decision because all the media was talking about Guardiola here, Guardiola in Arsenal, Guardiola in Manchester United. It was not fair for all managers \u2013 when everyone knew he was coming here.\u201d Now comes the crucial caveat. \u201cIf I ask if I would do that again \u2026\u201d Pellegrini sighs. \u201cI have some doubts.\u201d This is honest. \u201cYes. I am very self-critical about what I do. Always. I don\u2019t want to use [this] as an excuse but it was so difficult to work after that. Not for me, for the players.\u201d Pellegrini is clear he did not have to convince the club to go public. \u201cNo, it was my decision. It\u2019s impossible to know if it was the right decision. But when you see the consequence of losing immediately three games in a row when you are winning the last five or something. The most difficult thing in a group is when you break something. Something was broken in that moment so, as I say, the complete glass is broken.\u201d Pellegrini bangs the desk for emphasis. \u201cThen, you must try to rearrange it.\u201d           Manuel Pellegrini to leave Manchester City at end of season    On 1 February City confirmed that Guardiola would replace Pellegrini. The team had 47 points, three fewer than Leicester City, and were in second position. They had lost once in the league since 5 December. On 2 February Sunderland were beaten 1-0 at the Stadium of Light. Then results went south. City failed to win another league game for more than a month. They lost the next three matches in a row, including a 5-1 defeat at Chelsea in the FA Cup, though this was with a weakened XI. And by 1 April, two months after the announcement, they still had only one league victory, a 4-0 win against Aston Villa. Leicester had 66 points and City 51, adding only four since the Guardiola announcement. Their title hopes were finished and they were now in a top-four finish dogfight. Put to him that all elite footballers are self\u2011motivating, so this should not have affected Ag\u00fcero and company, Pellegrini has a simple response. \u201cYeah, but you must do it all together \u2013 and for different reasons, when you don\u2019t link all the players, then \u2026 Look what happened with Chelsea,\u201d he says, smiling at the memory of how the side then managed by United\u2019s new manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, bombed. \u201cThe same manager, the same players \u2013 that\u2019s football. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the most popular sport of the world.\u201d City ended on 66 points, beating United to fourth place on goal difference. They claimed a second Capital One Cup under Pellegrini and he led City to the European Cup semi-final for the first time. Yet Pellegrini names this as his least successful campaign \u2013 poorer than the previous one when they won nothing, finished second and were knocked out for a second year in a row by Barcelona in the Champions League last 16.

Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    This is because of the style of play and the insipid manner in which City went out of the Champions League. He says: \u201cThe semi-final with Real Madrid: they can eliminate you but not in that way. Before we were with our mind on other things \u2013 at Southampton we lose [4-2], we draw with Arsenal, and we draw with Swansea. So we have two points from the last nine. If we have the normal finish winning those games we finish second. For me which season I was less happy with: this one.\u201d Pellegrini points to how the injury problems of David Silva and Samir Nasri drained the side\u2019s creative forces. But he denies being a tactically limited manager who can espouse only an attacking philosophy, as is the prevailing view of him. \u201cI like to know how to defend but with three players when they have a counterattack. Then, with line-back [the defence] and one midfielder. Line-back with three midfielders. Line-back with 11 players,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have 11 players you can make a good pressing. If not, you can\u2019t cover the complete pitch. You must cover a bit. What I want is to recover the ball as near to the other box as we can and when we have the ball, play. We couldn\u2019t do this this season because we didn\u2019t have 20 players [fit for long enough]. Silva was the whole year not fully fit. Samir Nasri couldn\u2019t play a whole year. Yaya [Tour\u00e9] was not in a good year. So what happened? We change our style of play, that\u2019s why in three seasons I change absolutely the way we play.    'If I don\u2019t have a really interesting option I will stop. Of course I would miss it. The challenge keeps me alive.'    \u201cIn this year with Navas, Sterling, De Bruyne, it\u2019s impossible to be a technical team. You must be a speed team, one-v-one, make cross and counterattacks at speed. But I was not happy with the style of football we play \u2013 I don\u2019t think that we had creative players.\u201d Now Pellegrini points to the Premier League stat sheet. \u201cIf you can see, during the three seasons, we have 230 points. We are the best. We all play 114 games, we won 70, we draw 21 \u2013 the team that draws the least. We lost 23, the best was Chelsea \u2013 21, just two games less. We scored 256 goals and the defending was so bad,\u201d he says, in tongue-in-cheek manner, referencing the side\u2019s perceived weak area. \u201cIt was 116. 112 is the least, Chelsea.\u201d Last summer\u2019s headline arrivals were De Bruyne for \u00a355m from Wolfsburg and Sterling for \u00a349m from Liverpool. De Bruyne scored 16 times in 41 games in a campaign disrupted by a knee injury that ruled him out from late January to early April, while Sterling scored 11 times in 47 appearances. Pellegrini can now admit De Bruyne\u2019s absence was a prime factor that \u201ckilled\u201d City\u2019s season. \u201cAbsolutely decisive. But as a manager what can you do? Say we cannot play without Kevin De Bruyne? What will all the other players think?\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you keep the ball so well as Kevin it\u2019s very difficult to be a bad player but he must improve and will. He has to play a bit more with care, not to [misplace] so many passes. He has so good technique, in one or two years more he will have better decisions with the last pass. \u201cSterling started well. After that, with the injuries and maybe the new demands of the club, the responsibility he has when he knows the club pay so much money for him, maybe this affected him. But I\u2019m sure this [next] season he will be really important.\u201d Pellegrini does not hide concern that the career of Vincent Kompany, the club captain, is in jeopardy due to a plague of injuries. Last season the 30-year-old managed only 21 appearances and the thigh problem he suffered during the second leg against Real, which ended his campaign, was his 33rd separate injury in eight years at City. Pellegrini says: \u201cI don\u2019t know what he will do in the future \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to understand.\u201d He is more optimistic on Silva, who sustained an ankle problem on international duty in the autumn and never fully recovered. Pellegrini has always referred to Silva as City\u2019s X-factor, and says: \u201cHe will return to be normal \u2013 David is just 30 years old.\u201d     Manuel Pellegrini when he was coach of Villarreal in 2006. The Chilean also coached at Real Madrid and M\u00e1laga in Spain before coming to England in 2013. Photograph: Fernando Bustamante/AP    Pellegrini came from a family with no background in football but at 17 knew his path. \u201cFirst I was going to be a football player, then after that try to study medicine or engineering. But it was very difficult to do medicine, so I did engineering.\u201d He was a self-described \u201cmad dog\u201d defender who spent his whole career at Santiago\u2019s Universidad de Chile. \u201cMy team and Colo-Colo [the country\u2019s most successful club] \u2013 every game between them has 70,000, 80,000, fanatical fans,\u201d he says of 15 years as a professional. When he finished the aim was to expand the engineering company he ran while still a player. But on deciding to be a manager, the mad-dog mentality was discarded. \u201cBecause if I continue with a very strong character you are always having problems with players. I changed a lot because you can\u2019t take good decisions when you don\u2019t dominate yourself.\u201d This shows a depth of intelligence and self-analysis not all leading managers possess. \u201cMaybe, but when I decide to be a manager, it was a very difficult decision. I knew a very important Chilean coach, Fernando Riera. He was national manager at the 1962 World Cup in Chile. He worked at Benfica with Eusebio. He started to convince me,\u201d Pellegrini says with a laugh. \u201cSo when I decided, I decided to be a very important manager. Now I can say it because I did it. But in that moment I was 34, had my construction company doing small houses. I wanted to grow my company. Constructing houses I could earn 10 times what I did when I started managing. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any problem, I left the money to one side and started a lot of things. I learned English, French, Italian. I came here to Lilleshall [the FA\u2019s centre of excellence], Italy, France. I decided: \u2018I will be the best one. I will try to do it all what I need to be the best one.\u2019 It\u2019s not easy when you are in Chile, eh?\u201d Between 1988 and 2003 he managed Universidad, Palestino (three times), O\u2019Higgins and Universidad Cat\u00f3lica in Chile. Then he coached LDU Quito of Ecuador for three years, before three more years in Argentina, at San Lorenzo and River Plate. In 2004, having won cups in his homeland and championships in Ecuador and Argentina, he moved to the dream destination: Europe. \u201cI was 50, a good age. I went to Villarreal for 30% less than I could have earned in Mexico. I had a clear vision of where I wanted to go \u2013 Europe, without any doubt,\u201d he says, of the next nine years of which five were at Villarreal, one at Real Madrid and three at M\u00e1laga, before he replaced Roberto Mancini at City. Despite a persona that can be ultra-sober, Pellegrini is positive about the public profile a manager has. \u201cYou must speak to the media everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s another duty \u2013 how to explain exactly in English? I don\u2019t think that I can criticise you, in the way you write. I can\u2019t analyse your profession because I don\u2019t know it. But you can with me, and say what I must do and what I didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s not unfair, it\u2019s the rules. I can\u2019t criticise a doctor because I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d With Guardiola at City and Mourinho at United, Manchester is about to become an even more feverish centre of football. \u201cThe whole Premier League will be very interesting. It can happen what happened this year with Leicester but it\u2019s not normal,\u201d Pellegrini says. The one moment the shutters come down is when he is asked if Mourinho\u2019s \u201cdisaster\u201d at Chelsea, which caused him to be sacked in December, will hurt his prospects of success at United. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen with Mourinho in the future,\u201d he says quickly. What, then, is next for Pellegrini? Everton are thought to be interested in him, and he says: \u201cIf I don\u2019t have a really interesting option, I will stop until I find one. If I have to stop [completely], I will stop. It can be now, [until] December, one year or for ever. Of course, I would miss it. The challenge keeps me alive.\u201d And he laughs again. Pellegrini will surely be back in football sooner rather than later.",
