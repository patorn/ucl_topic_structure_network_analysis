  "body": "Name: 3nder. Age: Two. Appearance: Alphanumeric-stringy. What the hell is it? A BBC3 spin-off of EastEnders? A madly meaningless brand name for a new soft drink, a la 7Up? An old-skool Grauniad typo? It\u2019s an app that allows people who are interested in tr0ili3m to get in touch with each other. What? Troilism. Threesomes. Oh, so it\u2019s Tinder for people who are already bored with the people they met on Tinder? No! Hush! It\u2019s absolutely nothing like Tinder. Are you sure? Yes. Founder and CEO Dimo Trifonov says it\u2019s pronounced \u201cThree-ender\u201d. That makes sense, and I think that\u2019s how I\u2019d say it too. But it also looks like it could be \u201cThrender\u201d or \u201cThrinder\u201d. Rhyming with \u2026 Shh! Match Group, Tinder\u2019s owner, agrees with you and is suing 3nder for trademark infringement, citing an article in which Trifonov is quoted as saying that it \u201ccan be pronounced \u2018Thrinder\u2019 to rhyme with Tinder\u201d.   Related: Tinder sues threesome app rival 3nder    Isn\u2019t he banged to rights, then? Although only by one party, in this case. Not necessarily. \u201cCan be\u201d is not the same as \u201cofficially known as\u201d, is it? It\u2019s optional. \u201cTrue to our openminded values, we embrace all the various pronunciations,\u201d says 3nder\u2019s latest press release. Still, it does seem a bit like they could have been enjoying some benefit on Tinder\u2019s etymological coattails \u2026 Nonsense. 3nder has disbursed \u00a35,000 on marketing, and it\u2019s clearly been money well spent. Revenue is up 1,000% and the user base up 30% in the last year. \u00a35,000? But that\u2019s nothing. No one ever went broke underestimating the willingness of the public to bump uglies in unlikely combinations. Hmm. What is the legal requirement to prove trademark infringement? That the typical consumer would reasonably confuse the offending mark with the plaintiff\u2019s mark. Will the hormone-drenched brain processing centres and dilated pupils of either set of app users be affecting their vision, d\u2019you think? Doubtless the judge will take all this into consideration, along with any side effects of chlamydia and gonorrhoea medication before he swipes left or right with his verdict. Do say: \u201cWhat a 3lling case!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cDoesn\u2019t Tinder rhyme with Grindr too? And was released six months later, looking suspiciously like a Grindr for straights?\u201d",
