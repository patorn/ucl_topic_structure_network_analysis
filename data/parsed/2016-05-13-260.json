  "body": "Stones Roses released a new single Thursday, their first new studio material since the B-sides to the single Ten Storey Love Song in March 1995 \u2013 fans have been waiting 21 years since the band revealed Moses and Ride On, neither of which featured on the album Second Coming. The Guardian\u2019s music editor Tim Jonze, enjoyed its psychedelic vocals, Squire solo and its lyrical theme of solidarity, but it failed to move him like their previous works: \u201cFeels more like an imitation than the real thing \u2013 it has the swagger but it\u2019s heavy handed too, toiling away like a bog-standard Britpop rocker,\u201d he said. We asked Guardian readers to review the new single. Here\u2019s what they said. Patrick Lyle-Condon: \u2018It\u2019s too much like someone saying \u2018why don\u2019t we all hold hands and spin In a circle\u201d over and over again\u2019 Rating: 3 out of 5 Opening with a neat riff, it\u2019s a song that really sort of forces you to dance about a bit, although itsrepetitive nature unravels the subconscious magic of this inherently summery track quite quickly. The lyrics feel a little forced as well, trying too hard to give a lovely little message along with the groovy track. It feels too much like an attempt to sneak Brit-pop back into the mainstream.      \u201cI could however be missing a sense of nostalgia that others get from the track ... I wasn\u2019t around when they were around.\u201d Photograph: Patrick Lyle-Condon    I don\u2019t however dislike the track. Like I said the main riff serves as an extraordinarily catchy hook and the solo towards the end of the track is really tight; this track really gives me a sense of optimism about any further music they release this year and beyond, but it still isn\u2019t great. I could however be missing a sense of nostalgia that others get from the track. I\u2019m too young to really get the full effect of excitement from new music from The Stone Roses after 22 years. I wasn\u2019t around when they were around. I missed them by about 7 years.  For die-hard fans, this is most likely a welcome return, probably mixed in with a fair amount of relief that the new single isn\u2019t absolutely rubbish. I am however underwhelmed, I like the track and am looking forward to a new album but it\u2019s too much like someone saying \u201cwhy don\u2019t we all hold hands and spin in a circle\u201d over and over again for 3 minutes and 37 seconds for me. Daniel Thompson: \u2018Repetitive, child-like lyrics that sound like they were lifted from Liam Gallagher\u2019s \u2018maybe\u2019 pile\u2019 Rating: 1.5 out of 5 (\u2018but just for sentimental reasons\u2019) When I heard there was new Roses material, I felt a sense of dread. How could this band, which had meant so much to me as an 18 year old \u2013 they\u2019d already split, but still \u2013 live up to the standard I held them to? As it started, I thought it sounded like Bryan Adams fronting Rainbow. And then I realised that it sounded more like Rainbow, the kids\u2019 TV show.     \u201cIt\u2019s as if they suddenly remembered they\u2019ve booked studio time. Such is their continuing, some would say misplaced, self-belief.\u201d Photograph: Daniel Thompson    Repetitive, child-like lyrics that sound like they were lifted from Liam Gallagher\u2019s \u2018maybe\u2019 pile, delivered over a chugging, loose drum beat with none of the flair or precision heard on tracks like Elephant Stone. As I strained to pick out Mani in this horrific soup, I realised the bass sounds like a loop of the incidental backing music from Why Don\u2019t You? And then a pause, obviously an attempt to replicate the jubilant climax to Resurrection, which just ends up as a sort of weird farting noise. What makes it? A bike pump? An armpit squelch? No idea. It\u2019s as if they suddenly remembered they\u2019ve booked studio time. Such is their continuing, some would say misplaced, self-belief that they believed that hastily cobbled mess is good enough, better than good: mega. I\u2019ve heard their albums so much, I\u2019m not sure I ever need to play them again. I can\u2019t remember the last time I played one, so I wasn\u2019t expecting much. And yet I was still disappointed. Jamie Bowman: \u2018I always thought they were better when they were being arrogant and swaggering\u2019 Rating: 3 out of 5 My first impression wasn\u2019t great. I\u2019ve always preferred my Roses when they have a bit of menace, mystery and malevolence about them. Think Shoot You Down, I Wanna Be Adored, Love Spreads or Made of Stone. This all seemed a bit treacly and it recalled the over-produced Seahorses in its desire to pull a few classic rock tropes.     \u201cI like the way they\u2019ve tried to recapture the second summer of love and that communal feeling.\u201d Photograph: Jamie Bowman    Ian Brown sounded good though so I\u2019m not going to be too churlish about it. I just think they\u2019re much more than just a 60s influenced guitar pop band and this didn\u2019t really prove that.  As for the lyrics I like the way they\u2019ve tried to recapture the second summer of love and that communal feeling of \u201cif we all join hands we\u2019ll make a wall\u201d. There\u2019s something nice about that, but I always thought they were better when they were being arrogant and swaggering.  At its best their music made you feel incredible and that was because of the self belief in both the lyrics and the melodies themselves.  Scot Grenwell: \u201cThe music sounds good in parts but the lyrics sound very weak\u2019 Rating: 2 out of 5 Being a Roses fan for 20 plus years, I sat by the radio expecting the best. Unfortunately it just didn\u2019t deliver, I listened again and again but nothing. I am aware that some records take months, if not years, to grow on you but this doesn\u2019t seem to have the depth to do that.      \u201cThe opening lyrics sounded very obvious and rushed, however I thought the middle sections sounded good.\u201d Photograph: Scot Grenwell    The music sounds good in parts but the lyrics sound very weak. It\u2019s like Brown\u2019s solo music meets the Seahorses but instead of joining together in Roses fashion they go their separate ways. I was hoping for a darker moodier Roses or finally the musical progression from One Love. But this was not to be. It\u2019s more crowd-pleaser than belief-giver. Lyrically I thought the opening lyrics sounded very obvious and rushed, however I thought the middle sections sounded good. But not close to anything pre One Love, but it would hold up against the middle ground Second Coming tracks. Luis Arista: \u2018They\u2019re just doing what they know best, with a contemporary sound\u2019 Rating: to be decided  It\u2019s a catchy tune, with a superb guitar solo by John Squire, well done vocals by Ian Brown and great delivery by Reni and Mani. They aren\u2019t trying to invent anything they\u2019re just doing what they know best, with a contemporary sound. If the album is going to sound like this, their legacy is intact. And calling Paul Epworth to produce this was a very wise decision. The first six seconds of the song are pure mystery: just a guitar fading in. And then you just know it\u2019s John Squire and the band, even if you\u2019re listening to it for the first time. From then on, it\u2019s quite an unexpected, but enjoyable ride. That classic voice of Ian Brown is there, next to a great delivery by Mani and Reni. \u201cAll for one, one for all. If we all join hands we\u2019ll make a wall\u201d Brown repeats and by the third time you already know the catchy chorus. A couple more minutes of repetition you think the song is done and then John Squire\u2019s rocky guitar solo that came out of nowhere. Favourite moment by far. No more doubts for me: the Stone Roses are back and I\u2019m excited. If the album is going to sound like this, their legacy will remain intact. What do you think of the song?
