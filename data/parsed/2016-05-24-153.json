  "body": "If the face is a canvas, stubble can have an altering effect, but it can be more of a botch \u2013 think of the bizarre amateur restoration of the Spanish Ecce Homo fresco \u2013 than a masterpiece. There are no hard-and-fast rules with stubble growth \u2013 which might be part of the problem. Unless you are a vigilant self-groomer, the line between \u201cattractive stubble growth\u201d and sporting the look of someone who has fallen into an tar-black pit of endless despair can be indistinct and vague. Here\u2019s what some recent famous stubble growth signifies \u2026 Jose Mourinho Type of stubble: Baby moustacheWhat it telegraphs: A veil of mystery After the ignominy of being sacked by Chelsea in December, Mourinho\u2019s brilliantly stage-managed stubble was unsettled for most of this year. Now, on the cusp of his new role as Manchester United\u2019s new manager, on Monday he unveiled \u2026 hints of a baby moustache. It\u2019s both off-grid and utterly cryptic. The sort of subtle reinvention that you would normally see on a pop star about to release their difficult second album.  Jesse Eisenberg     Jesse Eisenberg and his soul patch. Photograph: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for BCG    Type of stubble: Soul patchWhat it telegraphs: A love of jazz As worn by such disparate characters as Billy Bob Thornton, William Shakespeare and Kingsley from Fresh Meat, the soul patch is definitely the Fredo Corleone of the stubble family. It\u2019s suggestive of the kind of character who might be the sole male participant in a hot-stone yoga class, who owns a lot of, you know, specialist vinyl, and is the owner of a stress-relief eucalyptus scented candle. Ant McPartlin     Ant \u2026 George Michael stubble, or something more?   Type of stubble: All overWhat it telegraphs: IDGAF Why has this stubble \u2013 the grooming chink in an otherwise fresh-faced TV presenter \u2013 appeared at all? If this were pop music we\u2019d all be thinking of the unsayable right now. He\u2019s going solo. Sorry, Dec. Enter the slowly immersive stubble growth and later the probable leather-jacket-shaped rebrand. Or, in pop terms, a 1987-era George Michael level of calculated sexiness.  Usher     SoulCycler? Usher sports the bof   Type of stubble: The bofWhat it telegraphs: Eat, pray, love Usher\u2019s journey from skullcap-wearing crooner to judge on The Voice has been interesting to observe. Perhaps more interesting has been his grooming journey \u2013 from mathematically sculptured goatee to this freeform beard, which he debuted at Cannes in the course of promoting the film Hands of Stone, in which he plays boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. We are calling the beard the bof (roughly translation: \u201c\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af)\u201d to keep the French theme. It\u2019s a look that asks: \u201care you in my SoulCycle class?\u201d, but which suggests a man of the cloth who is always ready to dispense worldly wisdom in a public space. Sometimes entirely unprompted.",
