The lead vocalist of pioneering hard rock outfit Deftones, a band that weaves relentless, tremendous riffs and sharp, evocative lyrics into vast emotional soundscapes, says the group\u2019s eighth studio album Gore is a shade of purple.  \u201cThe color was really specific to our idea,\u201d he muses, sitting on his porch in the countryside of Oregon. Throughout his life, the 42-year-old has often identified with purple. \u201cI\u2019ve always been into that color. Prince\u2019s Purple Rain is probably one of my favorite records \u2013 great movie, great song.\u201d   Related: Deftones: Gore review \u2013 metal that seduces instead of assails     Released last month, Gore is a stunning collection of 11 massive numbers that beckon and entice with no intention of loosening their grip. \u201cA lot of the lyrics on this record were written in a stream of consciousness,\u201d says Moreno. He thinks the key is vulnerability mixed with confidence. \u201cThe music is made first, and the words come as an answer to the music.\u201d  When the two fuse together, they turn purple. On the cover artwork of Gore are flamingos flying through a sky \u2013 lilac, not blue \u2013 with wings shadowed by shades of dark purple rather than a standard bright pink. \u201cThat\u2019s our juxtaposition: beauty versus aggression,\u201d says Deftones drummer Abe Cunningham, also 42. With so many flamingos in captivity sticking out on one leg, we often forget they can fly. \u201cGore on its own is a striking word \u2013 it can conjure up many different images. But in the photograph of the flamingos, there\u2019s that push-pull.\u201d  Color is a form of nonverbal communication: the impact of 1,000 words can be felt in a one-second glance at a specific shade. To some, purple represents the future, imagination and dreams, a color rooted in wisdom and harmony. Even in Indian belief, the crown chakra at the top of one\u2019s head \u2013 one of seven energy points throughout the human body, which is connected to a force of life greater than ourselves \u2013 is purple.   After everything Deftones have been through, no color is more fitting.             Founded in Sacramento, California, in 1988, the five-piece outfit \u2013 which includes Moreno on vocals, Cunningham on drums, Stephen Carpenter on guitar, Frank Delgado on keyboards and turntables, and Sergio Vega on bass \u2013 have redrawn the boundaries of hard rock by pushing metal, hip-hop and dream-like experimental through their now-definitive sound, especially on 2000\u2019s seminal release White Pony (which led to an additional wedge in nu-metal by critics).  But this isn\u2019t the original lineup that made the band\u2019s 1995 debut Adrenaline. Vega follows in the footsteps of longtime bassist Chi Cheng, who died in April 2013 after a four-and-a-half-year battle in a semi-comatose state, his injuries the result of a November 2008 car crash. Despite well-documented turmoil and talks of a breakup, Cheng\u2019s accident and, later on, his death, Deftones have persevered for more than two decades while many of their peers faded from the music industry.  The band have, they say, been brought closer by the band\u2019s ups and downs. \u201cLife is an impressive thing because time goes by fast,\u201d says Moreno. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most important things we have. We\u2019ve learned to appreciate each other\u2019s company and respect the fact that we\u2019ve all been friends longer than we\u2019ve been in a band.\u201d  Gore captures that spirit. The group\u2019s first release since Cheng\u2019s death, it\u2019s the product of understanding, acceptance and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 wisdom. \u201cQuite frankly, I feel everything with this record,\u201d says Cunningham. \u201cUp until [Chi\u2019s accident], we hadn\u2019t really tried to rekindle our love for each other, even though it was totally there right in front of our eyes. It really brought everything into perspective \u2013 we started being nice to each other, for a lack of better words.\u201d  The band say that despite his death, Cheng\u2019s presence feels stronger than ever. \u201cChi\u2019s personality was always very big brother to us,\u201d says Moreno (Cheng was the band\u2019s eldest). \u201cI still feel very much connected in that way. There\u2019s not a month that goes by \u2013 at least two to three times a month \u2013 I have vivid dreams with him, having conversations about things that are relevant, that are very much of the now.\u201d  Also in the psychology of the color purple is the connection between the physical and spiritual world. In some cultures, it\u2019s even a color of mourning. \u201cHow would he know these things when seven years ago, he went into a coma?\u201d Moreno continues. \u201cHe\u2019s still there, even when we\u2019re making records.\u201d  His spirit is tremendous, says Cunningham. \u201cHe was one of the funniest human beings on the planet. I hear his laughter all the time, he spent a lot of time just fucking laughing. It\u2019s a celebration with him and it\u2019s fuel to keep going in his honor, if you will.\u201d  Moreno, Cunningham and Carpenter formed the band when they were just 15 years old. Cheng joined two years later \u2013 Moreno moved in with him then, and the two shared a one-bedroom apartment while working at the same place. They were the epitome of best friends. \u201cIt was very pure,\u201d Cunningham recalls. \u201cThat fire still burns [today] and these embers find themselves in full flame at times.\u201d Such was the situation with Gore, which came together after the band took a year off from music-making in 2014.  \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy for all of us \u2013 for months at a time \u2013 to not think about music,\u201d says Moreno. After a break, the band gets together to make noise. \u201cOur collaboration is what\u2019s inspiring.\u201d  Yet between then and the album\u2019s release, which was pushed back several times, Deftones found themselves in the midst of a terrorism attack in Paris on 13 November 2015. Three members of the band and crew were attending an Eagles of Death Metal show at Le Bataclan, a Parisian concert venue. They left only a few minutes before terrorists stormed the club and took fans hostage, killing 89 people. Deftones were scheduled to perform at Le Bataclan the next three nights, but all European shows were effectively cancelled.  \u201cMany thoughts crossed all of our minds,\u201d says Cunningham. \u201cThat was such a surreal moment, way too close to home if you catch my drift \u2013 Chino had his wife and daughter there. I would have chosen to keep on going, but I\u2019m one of five and some of us were shaken up more than others.\u201d  He says Deftones, whose US tour starts on Sunday, travel the world and play music in the hopes of bringing joy or relief to whoever is listening, and nothing can ever change this. \u201cThat was a very heavy and sad time, but the show must go on,\u201d Cunningham continues. Like the flamingos on Gore, they fly when they\u2019re not expected to. \u201cHere we are getting back to it.\u201d",
