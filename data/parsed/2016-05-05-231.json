  "body": "The senators appeared not to care that Michelle Guthrie had been in the ABC managing director\u2019s chair for only four days, demanding she answer detailed questions at her first Senate estimates appearance.  The senators were so keen to ask Guthrie about everything from the cuts to the ABC\u2019s budget to the broadcaster\u2019s Middle East coverage that she was forced to miss her 7pm flight back to Sydney after her session on Thursday was extended well beyond the scheduled 30 minutes.  \u201cI\u2019m not enjoying missing my flight,\u201d Guthrie told the Greens senator Scott Ludlam, who asked her if she was enjoying her first estimates.  Another newcomer to estimates, the Liberal senator James Paterson, grilled Guthrie about the ABC\u2019s new bespoke font for its websites and the perceived bias of the ABC\u2019s political reporting.  Paterson asked if Guthrie was comfortable that the ABC\u2019s Middle East correspondent Sophie McNeill was a \u201cpolitical activist\u201d.  \u201cShe isn\u2019t a political activist, she is a journalist,\u201d Guthrie said.  Late last year her predecessor, Mark Scott, was asked the same questions.

Dastyari became frustrated when she refused to disclose what was discussed at the ABC\u2019s board meetings.  \u201cIt\u2019s an internal board matter and we don\u2019t discuss those internal board matters,\u201d Guthrie said.  Dastyari replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d  Senator Bridget Mackenzie was equally brusque with the new managing director demanding to know how she planned to change the ABC\u2019s so-called Sydney-centric culture and for her immediate response to a report which had only just been tabled that day.  \u201cWhat steps are you going to take as managing director to overcome that perception that the ABC is Sydney-centric? Mackenzie asked.  \u201cI have been to every state and territory and I hope to add more offices in the next few months,\u201d Guthrie said, praising the \u201cpassion and commitment\u201d of the ABC staff she met.   \u201cOne of the things that struck me as I travelled around was how every office had \u2018special sauce\u2019.\u201d   But Mackenzie wasn\u2019t happy with that answer and pushed for her detailed plans.  \u201cSenator, I hope you appreciate it\u2019s very early days for me to give you specific details of all my plans,\u201d Guthrie said.  Earlier the former Google executive had tried to inject some humour into proceedings by saying she had enjoyed communications minister Mitch Fifield\u2019s rendition of the Play School song at the opening of an exhibition on Thursday.   \u201cWhat is abundantly clear to me is that the ABC is one of Australia\u2019s most trusted, respected and important institutions,\u201d Guthrie said in her opening statement. \u201cAt a time of massive disruption in the media sector the national broadcaster remains a champion of media diversity, quality and innovation.\u201d",
