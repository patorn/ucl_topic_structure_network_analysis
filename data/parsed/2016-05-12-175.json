  "body": "The Oscar-winning film-maker Adam McKay has defended plans for a controversial comedy about Ronald Reagan suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease after his producing partner Will Ferrell was forced to step away from the project in the wake of rightwing outrage. Adam McKay, known for The Big Short and Anchorman, was due to produce Reagan through the Gary Sanchez production company he runs with Ferrell. The erstwhile Saturday Night Live comic was in line to play the former president, but walked away following a media furore.   Related: Will Ferrell backs out of Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's comedy    Reagan\u2019s central conceit is that the president was suffering from dementia during his second term. Publicity for a live read-through in Los Angeles in March described the screenplay as a \u201chilarious political satire\u201d about an ambitious intern tasked with convincing the dementia-stricken commander in chief that he is an actor playing the president in a movie. McKay pointed out that the Hollywood Reporter conducted a script review and described the screenplay as \u201ca really thoughtful script and tender towards Reagan\u201d. He blamed internet culture for the way conservative websites jumped on the story. \u201cI\u2019ve never been that close to a story like that where so little information became such a tidal wave. It was really crazy to behold,\u201d McKay told the Daily Beast. \u201cPeople hadn\u2019t even read the script, it was just three words: \u2018Reagan, Ferrell, Alzheimer\u2019s,\u2019 and it became this huge thing \u2026 it\u2019s this culture we live in. It\u2019s all about clicks, clicks, clicks and hits, hits, hits.\u201d    Related: The joke isn't on Ronald Reagan's illness, but on America for elevating him    Continued McKay: \u201cI kept saying when that story snowballed, \u2018Is there anyone who really thinks Will Ferrell would make a comedy about a horrible disease like Alzheimer\u2019s?\u2019 In a million years no one would do that!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d have people on the left and right coming after you. I think it\u2019s more about the deification of Ronald Reagan, where you can\u2019t go near the subject of Ronald Reagan. \u201cWill wasn\u2019t even attached to do the movie! He was just looking at it. It didn\u2019t even have a director yet or was set up. It was just one of 30 projects Will was looking at.\u201d  McKay also described the fallout from the media storm, which led to Gary Sanchez\u2019s offices being bombarded with hate mail. \u201cIt was scary, man. There are some scary people out there who respond to stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were scary messages left at our office. Stuff like, \u2018How dare you say anything bad about Ronald Reagan, you better watch your back.\u2019 Some very scary voicemails.\u201d Opponents of the project continue to insist that Reagan amounted to an Alzheimer\u2019s themed comedy about the former president. And in fairness, the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s script review appeared to confirm the controversial subject matter. \u201c[The film] does revolve around the conceit that the 40th president had no knowledge of where he was or what he was doing throughout his entire second term,\u201d it reads. At one point Reagan, imagining himself on a film set in his heyday, asks for a wardrobe assistant named \u201cLibby\u201d to be sacked. This leads to the 1986 US bombing of Libya.",
