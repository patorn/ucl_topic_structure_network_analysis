Related: Manchester United to confirm Louis van Gaal's exit as Mourinho stands by \u2013 live!    J\u00fcrgen Klopp has identified the man who scored Germany\u2019s winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final as a transfer priority and was optimistic of completing a deal for around \u00a320m. However, despite reports last month that the 23-year-old has been told by the incoming Bayern manager Carlo Ancelotti that he does not figure in his plans, the German newspaper Bild quoted G\u00f6tze as saying he has now decided to remain in Munich. \u201cI look forward to the new season in Munich and will do everything possible to be in top shape for my first training session under Carlo Ancelotti,\u201d he said. G\u00f6tze, who played under Klopp at Borussia Dortmund before moving to Bayern in 2013, has one year left on his contract but only made 12 appearances under Pep Guardiola. It was understood that the playmaker was interested in leaving the Allianz Arena in search of more regular football but his situation has been further complicated by the news that he has parted company with his long-term agents SportsTotal. \u201cSportsTotal and Mario G\u00f6tze end their six-year collaboration by mutual agreement,\u201d read a statement from the agency. \u201cThis is the result of a conversation SportsTotal CEO Volker Struth and the 23-year-old forward who met after Bayern Munich\u2019s game last Saturday. \u201cAfter extensive deliberations and discussions in the past few weeks, we have come together to decide that we will terminate the cooperation. Therefore we met for a joint discussion and parted by mutual consent. I thank him for his many years of trust and wish him well for the future.\u201d G\u00f6tze added: \u201cI thank SportsTotal for a very good cooperation with many highlights and great memories that have shaped my career decisively.\u201d G\u00f6tze was due to travel to Ascona in Switzerland on Monday to link up with the Germany squad before Euro 2016 having sat out Bayern\u2019s victory in the German Cup final due to a broken rib. Bayern have also completed the signing of the Dortmund captain Mats Hummels on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee. The centre-back\u2019s contract was due to expire in 2017.",
