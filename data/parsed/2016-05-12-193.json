  "body": "Woody Allen\u2019s opening night film of the 69th Cannes film festival, Cafe Society, has been generally well-received by critics. But Wednesday\u2019s kick-off to the event was by no means smooth for the 80-year-old film-maker. The morning of the premiere, a piece by Ronan Farrow, Allen\u2019s estranged son, ran in the Hollywood Reporter, restating his support for his stepsister, Dylan, who has in the past claimed Allen sexually assaulted her as a child. Later, in introducing the film at the Lumiere cinema, master of ceremonies Laurent Lafitte shocked the audience when he addressed a joke to Allen, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s very nice that you\u2019ve been shooting so many movies in Europe, even if you are not being convicted for rape in the US.\u201d    Related: Ronan Farrow condemns media for handling of Woody Allen allegations    At a press lunch for Cafe Society on Thursday in Cannes a reporter asked Allen what it was like to be confronted by Ronan\u2019s letter mere hours before opening night. Allen said that he hasn\u2019t read it. \u201cI never read anything about me,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThese interviews I do, anything. I said everything I had to say about that whole issue in the New York Times. I have moved so far past it. I never think about it. I work. It\u2019s worked for me. I\u2019ve been very productive over the years by not thinking about myself.   Related: Woody Allen at Cannes: artistic competition 'against common sense'    \u201cI\u2019ve said I was never going to comment on it again,\u201d he added. \u201cI could go on endlessly - then we\u2019d just be going on endlessly. I\u2019ve said everything I\u2019ve had to say about it.\u201d Another reporter asked him about Lafitte\u2019s joke. \u201cIt would take a lot to offend me,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI am completely in favor of comedians making any jokes they want,\u201d Allen continued. \u201cI am a non-judgmental or [non]-censorship person on jokes. I\u2019m a comic myself and I feel they should be free to make whatever jokes they want.\u201d At the same event, Blake Lively, who has a supporting role in Cafe Society, said that she wasn\u2019t a fan of Lafitte\u2019s manner of joking.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Woody,\u201d Lively told reporters. \u201cHe made three homophobic comments in a row. A Hitler joke. And a rape joke. It was all within 30 seconds \u2026 What on Earth was happening? It was really confusing.\u201d \u201cI think any jokes about rape, homophobia or Hitler is not a joke,\u201d Lively added. \u201cI think that was a hard thing swallow in 30 seconds. Film festivals are such a beautiful, respectful festivals of film and artists and to have that, it felt like it wouldn\u2019t have happened if it was in the 1940s. I can\u2019t imagine Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby going out and doing that. It was more disappointing for the artists in the room that someone was going up there making jokes about something that wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d It later emerged that journalists from the Hollywood Reporter, the magazine that published Ronan Farrow\u2019s article, were barred from the event. Allen\u2019s publicist, Leslee Dart was quoted by the Hollywood Reporter as saying: \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that I would show displeasure when the press \u2014 in this case, The Hollywood Reporter \u2014 goes out of its way to be harmful to my client.\u201d",
