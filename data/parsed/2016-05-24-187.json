Mire, who appeared via videolink at the Old Bailey, pleaded guilty to four other counts of attempted wounding. Wearing a blue jumper and grey tracksuit bottoms, he stared straight ahead during the hearing. Appearing before the recorder of London, Mire spoke only to confirm his name and give his plea to each of the five charges.
