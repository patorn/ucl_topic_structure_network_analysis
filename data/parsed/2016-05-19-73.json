  "body": "Prosecutors concluded their case against Baltimore police officer Edward Nero on Thursday by arguing the arrest of Freddie Gray in itself amounted to a crime. Nero, one of six officers facing charges over the death of Gray, is on trial for assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office \u2013 all misdemeanors. The assault charge stems from what the state contends was an illegal stop and detention of Gray \u2013 not from conduct that led directly to his death \u2013 in what many are calling a novel and ambitious legal theory by prosecutors. In closing arguments that were repeatedly interrupted by Baltimore judge Barry Williams, prosecutor Janice Bledsoe made the argument that police officers can be criminally responsible for their arrests. \u201cYou\u2019re saying here in this court that if there\u2019s an arrest and there isn\u2019t probable cause, it is a crime?\u201d asked an incredulous Williams. Bledsoe, flustered, asked for a moment before engaging in an exchange with Williams that ended with her conceding that, yes, she was arguing that prosecutors can pursue police officers for a crime for an improper arrest. In rebuttal, deputy chief state\u2019s attorney Michael Schatzow clarified, saying that not every arrest made without probable cause is a crime, only those in which \u201cthe officer is not objectively reasonable.\u201d    Related: Officer in trial over Freddie Gray death first to testify against fellow defendant    The case has in some ways turned the normal workings of the criminal legal system upside down, with prosecutors arguing that police officers should be punished for improper arrests, and the defense arguing that officers should be given leeway and discretion when following departmental procedure. It also makes for a risky first verdict for prosecutors in the closely watched case over Gray\u2019s death due to a severe spinal injury he incurred in police custody. After the first trial of officer William Porter, the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict and a mistrial was declared. That case has not yet been retried. Nero requested that his case be decided by a judge rather than a jury, meaning that his trial will almost certainly deliver the first verdict in the case. Williams has said he will offer a verdict on Monday morning. But legal experts warn that the arguments for charging Nero with a crime are on shaky legal footing and police warn of dramatic repercussions. Some law enforcement officials fear that if the judge rules in favor of the state on the assault charge that officers will find it more difficult to do their jobs. The Fraternal Order of Police, the head of the FBI, and many others have attributed murder spikes in Baltimore and other cities where police killings of black men have resulted in protests to \u201csecond guessing\u201d on the part of officers, which, they say, emboldens criminals, sometimes calling it the \u201cFerguson effect\u201d. Others think that perhaps police should second guess themselves more often. \u201cCurrently the police power to arrest on presumed probable cause has resulted in roughly 60-65% of arrests being dismissed or not prosecuted,\u201d said university of Maryland law professor Douglas Colbert. \u201cTo me that indicates that many of the people originally arrested should not have been charged or taken into custody.\u201d   Related: Is the 'Ferguson effect' real? Researcher has second thoughts    Generally, prosecutors argue for giving officers broad leeway in making searches, stops, or arrests, while defense attorneys ask judges to suppress evidence as the \u201cfruit\u201d of an illegal search. The prosecution of an officer for making an arrest without probable cause is exceedingly rare and, Colbert says, \u201cbold\u201d. The defense painted Nero as a former firefighter who became a cop because he wanted to help people. He was \u201cwell-respected by the people in the community\u201d, said Nero\u2019s lawyer Marc Zayon. Nero was on bike patrol in the area where he and other officers encountered Gray because of a directive sent by the state\u2019s attorney asking officers to ramp up their presence there because of increased drug activity. Officer Garrett Miller, who also faces charges over Gray\u2019s death, was forced to testify by prosecutors. But his testimony may have hurt their case. He said that it was he and not Nero who initially apprehended and handcuffed Gray and that Nero did not touch Gray until he asked for an asthma inhaler. The prosecution argued that because Nero was involved in the arrest, he is legally culpable even if it was Miller who physically arrested Gray. Two broad supreme court rulings on fourth amendment rights are in play in this case. The defense argues that Gray\u2019s arrest was legal under Illinois v Wardlow, which held that an officer can pursue someone for fleeing at the approach of an officer in a high crime area. But the prosecution argued that Terry v Ohio specifically prohibits the kind of detention and search the officers made of Gray. So-called \u201cTerry stops\u201d and frisks allow an officer to detain someone only long enough to dispel or confirm a reasonable, articulable suspicion of unlawful conduct. \u201cThe evidence will show it is an arrest, not a Terry stop,\u201d Schatzow said of Gray\u2019s initial detention. \u201cHandcuffing does not automatically turn a detention into an arrest,\u201d Nero\u2019s lawyer countered. \u201cThey may not like it. I don\u2019t like it, I\u2019m normally on the other side.\u201d But, Zayon argued, such stops are legal. According to police, Gray ran when he saw Lt Brian Rice. But Brandon Ross, who was with Gray the morning he was arrested, testified that Gray started running seconds before he saw Rice, which would mean that the stop was not applicable under Wardlow. Rice called in a foot chase and Miller and Nero, who were on bike patrol, pursued him, without knowing what he was suspected of, Miller testified. When Miller caught up with him at Gilmor Homes, he immediately put Gray into a prone position and handcuffed him. Miller testified that Rice did not indicate what the suspects had done and that he didn\u2019t ask questions so as not to block the radio. Prosecutors argued that it was Nero\u2019s duty to do so. Upon searching Gray, which the prosecution claims was illegal, the officers found a knife, which they thought was an illegal switchblade and served as the basis for the arrest. But the knife was not mentioned at all during the trial, because of a defense motion which prohibited the prosecution from doing so. In his testimony, Ross said he called 911 to report the arrest as an assault, but gave a false name. \u201cI knew I was going to be harassed and messed with by police officers,\u201d he said when asked by the defense why he gave a false name. Ross had already spent 45 days in jail shortly after Gray\u2019s death for not having a registration on a dirtbike and was recently arrested for assault charges, which a member of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office will prosecute. He was led from the courtroom in cuffs. The reckless endangerment charge against Nero charge stems from helping to load Gray into the police transport van, where the medical examiner says he suffered his fatal wounds, and failing to hook his seatbelt. \u201cMr Gray was put in a risky and dangerous position on the floor of the van,\u201d Schatzow said. The defense argued that the statute dealing with reckless endangerment does not apply to situations \u201cinvolving the use of a motor vehicle\u201d. Zayon also called a number of witnesses who testified that Nero had not been trained to hook seatbelts in transport vans and that it was not his responsibility to do so. As during the first trial of Porter, a general picture of a department with haphazard training and communications emerged from the testimony. \u201cTwo years on the force, he was a baby officer, still learning all of this,\u201d Zayon said in closing.",
