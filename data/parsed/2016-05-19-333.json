  "body": "The Peruvian presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori has announced a senior aide\u2019s resignation after media reports linked the two to money laundering.  Fujimori said Joaquin Ramirez, her party\u2019s secretary general, had offered to step down, even though both have denied any wrongdoing.  \u201cHe understands that there is an intent to upset my presidential campaign,\u201d Fujimori told reporters in broadcast comments as she displayed Ramirez\u2019 resignation letter.  In a joint Sunday broadcast, Univision\u2019s investigative unit and Peruvian television show Cuarto Poder reported that Ramirez was the subject of a money laundering investigation by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).   Related: Peru election: Keiko Fujimori faces run-off despite first round lead     The report featured a man identified as a pilot and DEA informant who said he recorded Ramirez stating that he laundered $15m for Fujimori\u2019s previous political campaign.  The DEA said on Monday that Fujimori had never been under investigation, a statement she and her supporters touted as vindication.  But the agency made no reference to Ramirez and critics have said Fujimori, the eldest daughter of imprisoned ex-president Alberto Fujimori, was too quick to defend Ramirez and dismiss questions over the source of his wealth.  Ramirez, who once worked collecting bus fares, owns several real estate and construction businesses and has been part of a preliminary money-laundering investigation by Peruvian prosecutors since 2014.  He has said Lima\u2019s elite cannot believe a non-white man from a working-class background can become rich without being a criminal.  The scandal comes three weeks before a closely fought election between Fujimori and centrist rival Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a 77-year-old former World Bank economist and prime minister.  Most polls show the two candidates neck and neck ahead of the 5 June run-off.  Although Fujimori came in first by a wide margin in the first election round in April, she faces stiff opposition from Peruvians who loathe her father.  Alberto Fujimori is serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and human rights abuses during his authoritarian rule. With Reuters",
