Back then, four matches without a victory had meant their lead at the top of the league had virtually disappeared, forcing them to go and win it again in Gerard Piqu\u00e9\u2019s words. On Saturday, they\u2019d done just that. There were a few minutes left at Los C\u00e1rmenes when Luis Su\u00e1rez scored the third to secure five wins in five and the title too. Over the opposite side of the ground, supporters had come down to the front ready to make a break for it and the players were doing the same. Standing, hopping from foot to foot as the clock ticked, edging forward towards the touchline. On their marks, set ... Go! The final whistle went and the players raced on to the pitch, Munir taking an early lead. They leapt into each others\u2019 arms, champions again. Barcelona\u2019s players circled, celebrating, a kid in glasses clinging to Piqu\u00e9\u2019s side. From the four corners of the ground, hundreds of fans hurtled towards them like human arrows, as if emergency evacuation instructions had been issued and the team were the assembly point. Barcelona fans ran, Granada fans too. In the middle somewhere were the players. Eventually they bundled through and into the tunnel. Leo Messi\u2019s shirt was handed over, Iniesta said a few words, and they went back on to the pitch; this time a ring of yellow bibs protected a patch of it for their public party.            That was just the start. \u201cThe party will be a long one,\u201d Ivan Rakitic said. \u201cI\u2019m boring, but I\u2019ll enjoy it in my 46-year-old way,\u201d said the Barcelona manager Luis Enrique with a smile. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve told the players to have a big party; they deserve it.\u201d Outside the away dressing room stood Granada\u2019s Isaac Cuenca. A former Bar\u00e7a player, he had decided not to go in yet. \u201cThey were celebrating,\u201d he explained, so he waited. Eventually the players emerged. Barcelona\u2019s bus left at three minutes past eight, bound for the airport. When their flight home landed, they were applauded off the plane; fans with flares lined their route back to Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, while others headed down the Ramblas. The Camp Nou was packed; Bruce Springsteen was playing. \u201cCongratulations, Barcelona!\u201d he announced, in Catalan.    Related: Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are a team made for suffering as title bid ends so close to line | Sid Lowe    The Vela Hotel near the sea awaited that night and an open-topped bus parade the next day. \u201cI\u2019m going to really give my all on that,\u201d Piqu\u00e9 announced. And why not? This had become the title that Barcelona might lose, the greatest collapse of them all, but it ended up another title that they did win. If winning the league had felt like an obligation rather than an opportunity, that sensation had gone by Saturday night, blown away like the blossom here. Sure, mad Madridista Tom\u00e1s Roncero hailed Zinedine Zidane\u2019s league in AS, but no one else did. \u201cThis tastes of glory,\u201d Iniesta said, adding: \u201cwinning the league can never be a bad season.\u201d Still less winning it again: this was Bar\u00e7a\u2019s sixth in eight years. And there\u2019s still a Copa del Rey final to come. \u201cThere are people who have become too used to the good times and think that this is not a big deal but if winning the league is a bad year, it\u2019s time to pack up, switch off the lights and go home,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cI would like people to appreciate what this means, how difficult it is to win the title. Just look at opponents of our level and how hard they find it.\u201d Opponents such as Madrid, in other words. They have the Champions League final of course, and that will always eclipse everything else, but in the eight years that Barcelona have won six league titles, Madrid have won only one. Of the last 12 Bar\u00e7a have won eight, Madrid three. \u201cRichly deserved!\u201d ran the cover of Sport, and they would say that, but ultimately few could argue. Barcelona have scored more goals than anyone else, on 112, and between them Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Neymar have scored 130 goals in all competitions this season. They beat Atl\u00e9tico twice and Real Madrid 4-0. They had been top since October. And when it looked like they could be hauled down from there, they held on. If there was satisfaction for Madrid in pushing Barcelona to the line, Zidane justifiably proud of players who finished the season with 12 consecutive victories with a European final to come, there could also be satisfaction for Bar\u00e7a in resisting their challenge. After 39 games without a defeat, five games in April threatened to ruin everything: knocked out of the Champions League by Atl\u00e9tico, Barcelona were defeated by Madrid in the cl\u00e1sico and three more winless matches followed; when Piqu\u00e9 scored in the second cl\u00e1sico of the season, Barcelona were momentarily 13 points ahead of Madrid, the season all over, but with five weeks to go they led their biggest rivals by a solitary point. Only their head-to-head record kept them above Atl\u00e9tico. Defeat against Valencia left them with no margin of error. The crapping-yourself-ometre made a comeback, so did the heebie-jeebies. Luis Enrique was turning into Carlos Queiroz, crowed their critics. They were wrong, and in more ways than one. \u201cDo you think you will have to win all five to win the league and do you think you can?\u201d Luis Enrique was asked. \u201cYes and yes,\u201d he said. And so it proved. Barcelona\u2019s response was emphatic: five wins out of five, aggregate score: 24-0. When it became a sprint for the line, they got there first. \u201cWe spoke about it; we knew we had to trust in ourselves,\u201d Sergio Busquets admitted under the stand at Los C\u00e1rmenes on Saturday, a league title winner for the sixth time. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity not to have won the league before and above all to be knocked out of the Champions League but that day [after losing to Valencia], there was a positive message: we were the same players that had been spectacular last year and for much of this year too,\u201d he said. There were conversations, conclusions drawn. Like what? \u201cThose stay in the dressing room,\u201d Busquets smiled. Barcelona stood up. \u201cWe had to win the league twice; when we were eight, nine or 10 points clear we had \u2018won\u2019 it and then with that dip it was like we had lost it, even though we were leaders,\u201d Piqu\u00e9 said. \u201cI have the feeling that 20 years ago we would not have won this league; too often we were sunk by our own pessimism.\u201d Not this time, and few symbolise that better than him. After the Valencia game, he had insisted: \u201cwe will win the league: I am sure of it.\u201d Busquets added on Saturday: \u201cWe were convinced, although there are some who saw more darkness than others. Gerard is fundamental, a leader.\u201d Piqu\u00e9 will be president one day, said the president Josep Mar\u00eda Bartomeu: \u201cI\u2019d love that. Why not?\u201d    Piqu\u00e9 wore a t-shirt that read: \u201cS\u2019ha demostrat\u201d. They had demonstrated something, alright: personality as well as play    Like his team-mates, Piqu\u00e9 celebrated while wearing a t-shirt that read: \u201cS\u2019ha demostrat\u201d. They had demonstrated something, all right: personality as well as play. Messi, Dani Alves, Iniesta, and Javier Mascherano, in particular, had been superb. But few had led quite like Piqu\u00e9 or Su\u00e1rez, the man who embodied much of their evolution last year and has proven decisive this. Of those 24 goals in the final five games, when there was no margin for error, Su\u00e1rez scored 14. This weekend, when the title was on the line, he got a hat-trick. In the buildup to the game, the Catalan daily Sport had suggested that Su\u00e1rez needed to win this title to overcome the disappointment of losing it with Liverpool \u2013 because presumably last year\u2019s treble never happened, like \u2013 and if there were tears at Crystal Palace there were celebrations at Los C\u00e1rmenes. A season that started with him scoring at San Mam\u00e9s up at one end of Spain ended with him scoring in Granada, down at the other. Three more goals to take him to 40 league goals for the season,59 over all, and Barcelona to the title. No one has ever scored more league goals in a season except Messi and Ronaldo, the men from whom Su\u00e1rez has just taken the top scorer award for the first time in seven years. Oh, and he provided 16 assists in the league too, more than anyone else. \u201cLucho\u2019s league,\u201d Marca\u2019s called it. \u201cLuis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s league,\u201d AS agreed. \u201cI just had to tap it in,\u201d Su\u00e1rez shrugged. It was almost 8pm when he left the dressing room and there was mayhem under the stands where the engine was running on the team bus, hundreds of people screamed from behind the plastic barriers and the Granada striker Youssef El-Arabi was waiting for him; his two sons wanted a photo. Su\u00e1rez stopped and smiled. Under his arm was the match ball, signed by the Barcelona players who\u2019d just won the league again.  Talking points            \u2022 With 12 minutes of the season left, it all came out. Sporting Gij\u00f3n\u2019s manager Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez embraced his staff \u2013 \u201cfriends,\u201d he insisted \u2013 gripping them tightly before pulling away to see what was going on. All around him, people were losing their heads. Bodies were piling up in the far corner, red and white and blue. Yellow too, goalkeeper Pichu Cu\u00e9llar sprinting the length of the pitch, screaming, to leap on top. In the stands, they were going bonkers. On the touchline, others ran up and down, in no particular direction. Sporting knew now; Abelardo knew, and the dam broke. Which was when he started to cry. \u201cWhen you support a club like I do, when you belong to it, when you live it so intensely, you can\u2019t control your emotions,\u201d he said. None of them could. Sergio \u00c1lvarez\u2019s shot had just ripped through the air, smashed off the bar and into the net, keeping Sporting Gij\u00f3n in the first division. The team that some thought might go down last season, when they were in the second division; the team that pretty much everyone, including themselves, thought would go down this season when they were in the first division, stayed up. It was, most agreed, a miracle \u2013 one that had begun with that draw with Real Madrid on the opening day, became just about possible with a victory over Atl\u00e9tico, and ended with a victory over Villarreal on the final day. The team with the youngest squad (if not team) in the first division, none of whose players cost them anything, and who could not sign anyone this year with a debt of over \u20ac30m, will still be there next year.  Sporting reached the final day knowing that their destiny did not lie in their own hands, but Abelardo hadn\u2019t expected to even get this far. Getafe went to Betis knowing that a win would keep them up; Sporting had to beat Villarreal and wait for Getafe; Rayo had to beat Levante and wait for both of them. But Abelardo insisted: \u201cIf you had offered me that at the start of the season, I would have signed up for it.\u201d And there was good news for Sporting, too: Betis\u2019s supporters wanted them to survive and their players were taking it seriously. Meanwhile, Sporting faced Villarreal, whose season had effectively ended a fortnight ago. Much was made too of the fact that their manager, Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, is a Sporting fan who coached Sporting\u2019s B team and their first team, and who said he would like them to survive. This was big. Not just about \u2018survival\u2019, but about survival. Real survival.  Getafe have been in the first division for a decade but have not really succeeded in building a truly significant fan base from that, despite a series of bizarre and funny mobilisation campaigns, usually involving procreating, from zombie porn to dating apps for a football-themed fumble in a corner of the coliseum. They have the worst attendance figures in Spain and few have much sympathy for a club that has achieved impressive things but has little history. Financial problems have seen them sell players (and even their manager last season) during the winter window two years in a row; their owner\u2019s been trying to sell the club for ages; and it\u2019s tempting to suggest that having been relegated, they won\u2019t be back. Rayo too are in trouble, institutionally and financially. And as Abelardo put it, Sporting were playing for their lives; \u201cour existence.\u201d Going down could even mean going under.  6,500 Sporting fans turned up for training the day before and El Molin\u00f3n was packed. Jony, one of the season\u2019s outstanding players, a revelation this year, gave them the lead after just eight minutes. Getafe knew quickly: down at the Benito Villamar\u00edn, Betis\u2019s supporters started chanting: \u201cSporting! Sporting!\u201d. In Vallecas, Rayo went 1-0 up, then 2-0, but with Sporting leading it made little difference. Still, there were nerves at all three grounds. Sporting were safe; a goal from Getafe would see Getafe safe; a goal from Villarreal would see Rayo safe. At the start of the second half, Joaqu\u00edn turned to a Getafe player in the tunnel and shrugged as if to say: \u201cwhat do you want me to do?\u201d There was honour in the gesture: sorry, but .... Betis had nothing to play for but they were trying.  In the end, the team whose fate was in their own hands was the only team that didn\u2019t win. \u201cI didn\u2019t celebrate our goals because I put myself in [Getafe manager Juan] Esnaider\u2019s skin,\u201d the Betis manager Juan Merino admitted. \u201cThey must be destroyed; that\u2019s normal.\u201d \u201cWe knew what would happen in other games,\u201d Getafe\u2019s Cala said, but his team could not influence what would happen in their own. \u201cMaybe we didn\u2019t manage to the anxiety,\u201d Esnaider admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to play these kind of games when you know how much is hanging on them.\u201d Ten minutes into the second half there was a roar at the Molin\u00f3n and another, slightly smaller one in Vallecas. Betis had scored. Levante pulled one back, then Rayo went 3-1 up again. At almost exactly the same time, news came through: Betis had got a second: 2-0. There were 17 minutes left and Getafe were virtually out of the equation now; a late belter from \u00c1lvaro Medr\u00e1n made no difference. It was all about Rayo and Sporting. And Villarreal, of course: if they scored, Rayo would be safe and Sporting would be down. But they weren\u2019t about to score; Sporting were. With 12 minutes to go, \u00c1lvarez smashed in the second. Abelardo knew, and so soon did the rest, radios relaying the news. At last, his team were safe. It is some achievement, but he also admitted: \u201cWe have to thank Betis.\u201d  At the final whistle, there was a pitch invasion in Gij\u00f3n, players disappearing into the crowd. They fought their way o the tunnel, where drawings and letters from local children wishing them well had been pinned all over the wall. A small passageway, a kind of bubble, was cleared among the fans on the pitch and then, one by one they were called back out by a man with a microphone who shouted about how \u201cdespite the fact that they didn\u2019t want us there, Sporting are in primeraaaaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d. He started with Pichu Cu\u00e9llar, \u201cthe spider from Extremadura\u201d and then went through them, player after player, roared on by supporters and hugged by the youth teamers who lined the way. Alen Halilovic came out, dousing himself in the local cider, poured from up high, the way its supposed to be. All of them wore t-shirts offering thanks to the fans, except for Alberto Lora whose shirt was in honour of the late Manuel Preciado. Down in Seville and Vallecas, the scenes were different. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest day of my career,\u201d said the Getafe captain Pedro Le\u00f3n slowly, a vacant expression on his face. \u201cIf Esnaider had been made manager, we would have survived,\u201d he added. But it had been too late. Rayo\u2019s president Martin Presas was complaining that Villarreal, who\u2019d had four days off until Thursday, had \u201cnot even competed\u201d, drawing a response from Roberto Soldado: \u201crespect, please.\u201d (More worrying is the accusation that the week before his own players might not have done, more of which below). And asked about Marcelino, Esnaider smiled ironically: \u201cHe\u2019ll be happy; he\u2019ll be happy.\u201d Marcelino protested: \u201cOne thing is personal preference, another is professionalism. We tried to give our best.\u201d Not far away, Sporting\u2019s players were certainly doing so, as they have all season. \u201cIt\u2019s madness in there,\u201d Lora said of the dressing room. \u201cI am destroyed, exhausted mentally; these have been two extremely hard years but I\u2019m up in the clouds now. I could not be happier right now. We love this club, and I am mad about these fans,\u201d Abelardo said. \u201cNow let\u2019s see if we can build a bit, to ensure we don\u2019t suffer like this again.\u201d First though, he had other priorities: \u201cnow,\u201d he said, \u201cbeer and cider.\u201d \u2022 Rayo Vallecano sang all the way to segunda. \u201cIt would have been easy for the fans to abuse us, but instead they handed out a lesson,\u201d Paco J\u00e9mez said afterwards. It was after 10pm on the final day and it was all over but when he walked out of the ground and across the road, those fans were still waiting for him. Chanting and embracing him, surrounding him, shaking his hand. \u201cPaco stay!\u201d they sang. \u201cThis Paco J\u00e9mez doesn\u2019t surrender!\u201d they chanted. But this time, they had surrendered. For now, at least: after five years in the first division, their longest run, his team has gone down.            It would have been easier to abuse them, he was right. All the more so after reports were confirmed that the league is investigating their penultimate game \u2013 a 2-1 defeat at Real Sociedad that ultimately cost them their place in the first division. There may still be a huge story to unravel there, or maybe nothing at all will happen again. Countless questions hang. Like: did J\u00e9mez really call an impromptu press conference last week just to come out the following day and say things he\u2019d said before? Did the changes in the team mean something else? Why did a story offered up without any proof emerge at all \u2013 from the league itself, don\u2019t forget \u2013 just days before the season\u2019s end, with three teams fighting relegation? Who benefits from that? Whose image lies in pieces and why? And what difference does it make on the final day? What will the \u201cinvestigation\u201d actually entail? So many questions, so much that doesn\u2019t fit. Ultimately, that Real Sociedad match should have been Rayo\u2019s salvation. Win and they would have been close. \u201cOn the day we most needed to play well, we played badly,\u201d J\u00e9mez said, baffled. Or perhaps \u2013 and this is the doubt that lingers now, the bad smell \u2013 he was not so baffled, just furious and beaten. Either way, Rayo went into the last game knowing that their chances of survival were virtually non-existent. They needed Getafe and Sporting\u2019s results to go their way too, and they never truly expected that. But they would try. A long tarpaulin was attached to the barrier along the Avenida Albufera outside the ground: \u201cthere\u2019s no place in Vallekas for homophobia.\u201d Inside, the noise was full and loud: from \u201cA las armas!\u201d (To Arms) to their version of the Marseillaise and Yankee Doodle. Only momentarily did the ground fall silent and even then only for a few seconds: when Sporting got the second, any hope extinguished. But there had never been much. A 3-1 victory was not enough and was never likely to be. The Final Countdown, the track that accompanies every goal, boomed out three times and for the final time in the first division for now. Before the game, a banner read: \u201cIf loving you is a crime, I\u2019ll have hell all to myself.\u201d Others followed, some expressing disgust at football\u2019s dark corners, some expressing hope. \u201cDon\u2019t fear sinking: from shipwrecked boats emerge submarines\u201d, one said, which may not be the way it actually works but the sentiment was clear. \u201cVallecas belongs in primera\u201d, they chanted. But Vallecas\u2019s team doesn\u2019t any more. This was their best run in the top flight, but it\u2019s over now. \u201cWherever you are, we\u2019ll follow you,\u201d they sang. Players left, but fans didn\u2019t. Still they sang, until the footballers returned. Standing in a semi circle they stood, silently. Looking at the fans and looking lost. \u2022 \u201cSure Mad Madridista Tom\u00e1s Roncero hailed Zidane\u2019s league in AS, but no one else did.\u201d Ah. Oh. That was Sunday. By Monday, others had followed suit. The day after the league ended, the front cover of AS wasn\u2019t dedicated to Barcelona\u2019s title celebrations, or to Sporting surviving, or to Rayo going down, or to Getafe departing more than a decade later. No. It was dedicated to Zidane with the headline, \u201cZidane wins his league.\u201d The sports section of La Raz\u00f3n, \u201cThe Truth\u201d (stop giggling at the back), didn\u2019t even use \u201chis.\u201d They went for: \u201cZidane, league champion.\u201d    Related: Gonzalo Higua\u00edn is the history man as Gunnar Nordahl's record finally falls | Paolo Bandini    \u2022 \u201cIt has been a great season,\u201d Athletic\u2019s manager Ernesto Valverde said and, as usual, he was right. It started with a first title in 30 years, thousands of fans on the streets of Bilbao after they won the Spanish Super Cup, battering Barcelona to do so, and it ended with a 3-1 win over Sevilla to finish fifth and head back into Europe. It also ended with two goals from Aritz Aduriz, Spain\u2019s best striker at 35, and with the departure of the club captain Carlos Gurpegui after 14 years in the first team. He bade farewell wearing No18, thrown into the air by team-mates. \u2022 Juanfran departed to applause from Vallecas and hugs from Rayo\u2019s players. Unable to hold back the tears, he walked slowly from a pitch injured, relegated, and probably for the last time. He\u2019s 40 in July and leaves as a Levante player, the club where it all started back in 1994. Born in Valencia, a product of Levante\u2019s youth system, he cared. It\u2019s just a pity that so few of his team mates felt the same. A \u2018difficult\u2019 dressing room went down, taking better people with them. Still, if he does retire now, at least he Juanfran has a career he can fall back on: he\u2019s a qualified hairdresser. \u2022 \u201cOur challenge and our hopes now rest on the two finals,\u201d Unai Emery said. Sevilla, Europa League and Copa del Rey finalists, they have not won a single game away from home all season in the league.  \u2022 And so Cristiano Ronaldo scored 50 goals in a season, yet again. Bonkers. Two goals, a post, and a bar in just 45 minutes. He was withdrawn at half time after taking a slight knock ... and, just as significantly, after it became clear that Barcelona would win the league, Su\u00e1rez having scored twice to put his side 2-0 up in Granada and put him clear in the race for the Pichichi. Asked if he was OK after the game, what with the withdrawal and the knock and all that, Ronaldo shot back: \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the game, then? Did I not look alright to you?\u201d            \u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s been a very good season. I won\u2019t say excellent because excellent is winning the league,\u201d Simeone said. He also admitted that the club and Fernando Torres, who scored one and \u2018made\u2019 the other when his shot came back off the bar, are talking about the striker continuing next year. \u201cI gave my opinion based on performance,\u201d Simeone said, repeating his words from five months ago. At Christmas that opinion was \u201cdon\u2019t keep him\u201d; now that opinion is \u201cdo.\u201d Torres has got 12 goals this season; his 100th, scored in February, wasn\u2019t the end; it was the start.  \u2022 And in the used-to-be-managed-by-Brits derby, two teams that no longer had anything to play for played out a game in which they looked like two teams that no longer had anything to play for. Which is at least better than what it once looked like they might have to play for. La Real won 1-0 with a late, late goal, in front of a stadium that wasn\u2019t exactly full. Results: M\u00e1laga 4-1 Las Palmas, Espanyol 4-2 Eibar, Rayo Vallecano 3-1 Levante, Real Betis 2-1 Getafe, Sporting de Gij\u00f3n 2-0 Villarreal, Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a 0-2 Real Madrid, Granada 0-3 Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao 3-1 Sevilla, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2-0 Celta de Vigo, Valencia 0-1 Real Sociedad",
