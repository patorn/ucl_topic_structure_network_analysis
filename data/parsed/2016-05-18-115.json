  "body": "Dafne Schippers, the world champion sprinter who is expected to provide one of the most compelling stories at the Olympic Games, has stressed her relish and readiness for the gladiatorial intensity of running in the 100m and 200m in Rio de Janeiro this summer. The former heptathlete, who as recently as last May was still competing against Jessica Ennis-Hill in the multidiscipline event, caused a sensation when she won the greatest 200m women\u2019s race in history at the 2015 world championships. Schippers had only been training as a full-time sprinter for three months. \u201cThe girls in the heptathlon are definitely more easy-going and much friendlier,\u201d Schippers told the Guardian in an exclusive interview at her training camp on the outskirts of Arnhem in the Netherlands. \u201cYes, sprinters are more like gladiators but I don\u2019t really miss the heptathlon. I like to beat the tough girls.\u201d   Related: Dafne Schippers takes 200m world gold but Dina Asher-Smith misses medal    Schippers\u2019 remarkable run in Beijing, made even more extraordinary by it being only the second race in which three women dipped under 22 seconds, meant she recorded the third-fastest time in history. Only the discredited Florence Griffith Joyner and Marion Jones have run faster than Schippers \u2013 who, amid fierce post-race scrutiny, insisted she was a clean athlete. She was supported by Dutch journalists, who have followed her since she was a junior. Schippers had also beaten the 2012 Olympic 200m champion Allyson Felix when she was still a teenage heptathlete. After underlining how often she is tested, and her belief in the need for athletics to rid itself of its tarnished image, Schippers spoke to the Guardian about her role as a newcomer in the bruising world of sprinting. Asked if she has been subjected to stare-downs from rival sprinters hoping to intimidate her, Schippers said: \u201cPeople do do that. But I chose not to do it myself. It\u2019s just not my style. I find it amusing when other sprinters do and I just smile at them.\u201d Schippers will run in Manchester on Friday evening at the Great CityGames as she looks to build on her impressive early season performances. \u201cI had a perfect training camp in Florida,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was fantastic with really good weather and training conditions. My first race [last month] was in Gainesville and it was a 200m that was much faster than I\u2019ve ever done at this time of year [as Schippers, running into a slight breeze on a wet track, won in 22.25 seconds]. It was at the end of the training camp so it was very hard and conditions were not so good. But I was\u00a0happy.\u201d This month, in the season\u2019s first Diamond League meeting in Doha, Schippers finished second in the 100m behind Tori Bowie of the US but ahead of Jamaica\u2019s Veronica Campbell-Brown. \u201cIt was much better than expected. Before the competition I hoped to maybe run under 11 seconds so 10.83 was great and close to my personal best.\u201d At last year\u2019s world championships Schippers won silver in the 100m in 10.81 \u2013 and she seems on course for a concerted tilt at a sprint double in Rio. \u201cI am improving and I\u2019ve done so much work on my start. So I\u2019m ready for Manchester,\u201d she said. The Great CityGames are free to spectators and the 23-year-old Schippers embraces a concept designed to bring athletics to urban settings and attract a much wider public interest in the sport away from traditional stadiums. It will be screened live on television, on BBC2, with Schippers running soon after 7pm. \u201cIt\u2019s really special running in the street,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real street where there are shops and everything. The crowds are close and the competition is great. Last year I ran the 150m but this week it\u2019s the 100m. It\u2019s a very cool atmosphere.\u201d Schippers said she was thinking primarily about Manchester this week \u2013 even though the gate to the Dutch Olympic camp in Papendal, just outside Arnhem and an hour from Amsterdam, provides a countdown to Rio. There are under 80 days left before the Olympics begin but Schippers stressed that: \u201cI don\u2019t even notice the sign saying how many days to go. I find it easy not to think about it. I\u2019m happy it\u2019s Manchester next.\u201d",
