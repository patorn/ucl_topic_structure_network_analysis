  "body": "\u201cPhryne is often who people would like to be. She fights for the underdog, she fights for women\u2019s rights, she\u2019s incredibly sophisticated, independent and she\u2019s not afraid to put anyone\u2019s nose out of joint.\u201d   Related: How Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries conquered America    Essie Davis is back in Australia from the UK for a flying visit to attend the Logies awards. The actor was nominated for three awards, including best actress (TV Week readers\u2019 choice), most outstanding actress (peer-voted) and the gold Logie for her role in the ABC period drama Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries. Although she didn\u2019t take home any gongs, she\u2019s thrilled the show is so popular. \u201c[It] just goes to show how happy Phryne Fisher makes so many people.\u201d  The ABC show has been a surprise hit since it premiered in 2012. Based on Kerry Greenwood\u2019s popular novels, the show tells of heiress-turned-detective Phryne Fisher, who tackles the villains of 1920s Melbourne without ruffling her ebony black bob or losing an art deco earring. Another key to the show\u2019s success, Davis says, is the chemistry between Miss Fisher and her love interest Detective Jack Robinson, played by Nathan Page. \u201cPhryne and Jack have this funny, naughty, flirtatious, zingy relationship \u2013 it\u2019s delightful to lean into and watch,\u201d she says, \u201cbut then Phryne is also falling for lots of other people, so it\u2019s nice watching those relationships evolve.\u201d     Gold Logie nominee Essie Davis arrives at the 2016 Logie awards at the Crown Casino in Melbourne. Photograph: Joe Castro/AAP    But while the series is dappled with froth and flirting, it also deals with issues including abortion, feminism and gay rights. Commentators have noted that by couching these still-relevant but difficult topics in the past, period dramas such as Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries and Mad Men seem to make them more palatable for audiences. Davis hopes that\u2019s the case: \u201cIt may be easier for people to look at the stupidity of opinions nowadays when they are seen through the eyes of 1928,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can actually see the preposterousness of the situation.\u201d   Related: Game, set and murder: Miss Fisher's finest 1920s fashion \u2013 in pictures    After considerable success in Australia, the show has become a cult hit in the US and the UK, and is popular in Canada, France, Poland, and Italy, among others. \u201cGetting fan mail from Brazil is kind of funny,\u201d Davis says, laughing. Equally unexpected is the Miss Fisher colouring in book, which Davis was signing copies of as a promotional duty while in Melbourne. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of mindfulness and if colouring in is a way of reaching mindfulness, then I think it\u2019s great,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m amazed that anyone has the time to do that. I certainly don\u2019t.\u201d Although she says no decision has been made about a fourth season yet, she confirms there is a film version is in the works: \u201c[We\u2019re] just working out the ideas of how to make it bigger and better and more fabulous than the TV show.\u201d The gold Logie nomination was a curious one for Davis, given that the award is for the best personality on Australian TV, and she was the only actor among a field of much-loved television presenters. She\u2019s been successful since the early 90s but her trademark \u2013 if she has any \u2013 has been her ability to disappear into roles on productions as varied as Water Rats, The Matrix sequels, Girl with a Pearl Earring, Australia, The Slap and The Babadook. She admits: \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realise that I\u2019m the same person who has played all these parts.\u201d Soon, Davis will appear in an episode of Game of Thrones, playing a member of a theatrical troupe. \u201cRichard E Grant and I with our team of players are performing \u2018the game of thrones\u2019,\u201d she says \u2013 but while images have leaked hinting at her character\u2019s role in the production, Davis is keeping mum. \u201cThe rest of the story I can\u2019t reveal.\u201d     Noah Wiseman and Essie Davis in The Babadook Photograph: IFC Films/Courtesy Everett/RE     Related: The Babadook: 'I was screaming all day'    It was her role as the tormented single mother in Australian horror film The Babadook that won Davis the part in Game of Thrones, she says \u2013 and while it had a blink-and-you-missed-it release in Australia, she still gets asked about it wherever she goes. \u201cIt\u2019s massive in England and in America, massive internationally.\u201d Later this year the actor will be seen in Mindhorn, a comedy scripted by the Mighty Boosh\u2019s Julian Barratt and Simon Farnaby, starring Steve Coogan and Kenneth Branagh. Davis, a Mighty Boosh fan, describes it as a cross between Withnail and I and Anchorman. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the plot because it is so complicated, but I can tell you that it is a piece of pure silliness.\u201d",
