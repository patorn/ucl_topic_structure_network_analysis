  "body": "The calls started coming. Close friends of BMX racer Donny Robinson wanted him to know that if he noticed any changes in himself, if he got tired, or overly emotional, or simply didn\u2019t feel right, they would be there for him. Because those in the BMX community know about Dave Mirra, and they fear Robinson could eventually travel the same path.   Related: Dave Mirra had brain trauma disease CTE when he died, doctors say    Mirra, a BMX Freestyle and X Games superstar, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in February. Earlier this week, he was diagnosed with CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The degenerative brain disease that has primarily affected football players has, for the first time, entered the house of action sports athletes. \u201cIf there\u2019s any damage done (to me), it\u2019s already done,\u201d said Robinson, who has had at least 25 concussions. \u201cNow it\u2019s a waiting game, and that\u2019s really, really scary. People around us will be on higher alert. Are we a ticking time bomb?\u201d No one knows. In an interview with ESPN, Mirra\u2019s wife, Lauren, spoke of changes in Mirra\u2019s behavior in the months leading up to his suicide. Depression, listlessness, just not acting like himself. Concussions are common in BMX: riders like Mirra fly more than 20 feet in the air and often turn upside down doing their tricks, and racers like Robinson go faster and are in danger of colliding with other racers. Diagnosis and treatment of concussions have improved the past couple of years, especially at the elite level. But for those riders who\u2019ve retired or are at the tail end of their careers, when a knock on the head was considered just part of the competition, CTE remains a possible eventuality. That\u2019s a reality Jay Fraga lives every day. For the past six years, Fraga, who runs the website the Knockout Project, has suffered from PCS, or post concussion syndrome, the result of concussions while racing BMX. The symptoms of PCS are similar to those who had CTE. In a video he posted to his Facebook page after Mirra\u2019s diagnosis, Fraga said he doesn\u2019t like giving live interviews because he has a tough time keeping his train of thought (his interview for the Guardian was conducted via Facebook Messenger). \u201cA good day feels like you\u2019re not quite hungover, but probably overdid it a little the night before,\u201d Fraga wrote. \u201cThe bad days are like hell on earth \u2026 You go with the ebb and flow between those two extremes while also dealing with vision problems, balance issues, depression, mood swings, memory lapses, etc. Some of those things seem to get better. But then they come roaring back out of nowhere and you\u2019re left with the realization that you might always be like this. \u201cI go back and forth between wanting to know and not wanting to know (if he has CTE). I already feel lousy; what\u2019s it going to do to my emotional state to confirm the worst-case scenario?\u201d  Jason Richardson, a former BMX racer and current sports psychologist, breaks down why action sports athletes likely won\u2019t let Mirra\u2019s diagnosis change what they do. First, Richardson says, there\u2019s the \u201cit won\u2019t happen to me\u201d syndrome. And second, it\u2019s difficult for people to put themselves in a place they\u2019ve never been. It\u2019s a present-day bias: how it is now, is how it\u2019s going to be forever. And it is tough to think about what could happen while performing gravity-defying tricks or in the thick of a race. Especially something that seems far in the future \u2013 for others. Or, as Fraga puts it: \u201cPeople in our sports who have any sort of longevity in it are programmed to excel. They don\u2019t want to hear this shit. They want to believe that they\u2019re infallible and this was a fluke \u2013 or that it doesn\u2019t apply to them.\u201d Add to it the allure of fame, sponsorship, money, getting to the next trick or progression, the chase for perfection - for young riders, it makes what happened to Mirra seem an anomaly. Every rider who defies gravity knows they\u2019re going to fall. It\u2019s just a matter of when and how. \u201cHow can you tell someone, \u2018Quit your livelihood. Stop doing what gives you life. Stop walking. Stop breathing.\u2019 It\u2019s who you are as much as what you did,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the scary piece about it. CTE is insidious. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s happening and you won\u2019t be able to do anything about it. And you don\u2019t know when or if it\u2019s going to happen. Riders and psyche, there\u2019s a conversion of things that lead them to keep going. At 18 or 19 or 20, if you haven\u2019t been hurt and people are paying you and telling you you\u2019re great, you are immortal. It\u2019s hard to let go.\u201d Letting go. That\u2019s what Robinson, who won an Olympic bronze medal in 2008, now faces in his final year of racing BMX. After reading Lauren Mirra\u2019s account of her husband searching \u2013 and failing \u2013 to find something he felt as passionate about as competing in BMX Vert, Robinson believes having a plan for after he hangs up his helmet could make a difference. He fears if he has nothing to look forward to, then that could lead to depression, which might activate a chain of events that could end in suicide. He is creating a new Beginner BMX Racing league, continuing with his bicycle advocacy program, \u2018Let\u2019s Get Kids Back on Bikes,\u2019 and is working on his motivational speaking tour, \u2018How Far Can Two Wheels Take You?\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s very important to do everything I possibly can, nutritionally and transitionally,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThese things with my head could be coming up, but I\u2019m okay now. I\u2019m still hyper-focused on some end goal, and if I don\u2019t continue to have that, and I\u2019m wandering, that can\u2019t help things. \u201cThe best thing I can do is try to look at what (Mirra and others diagnosed with CTE after suicide) had going on in their lives and where it led them, and try to protect myself the best I can, and not put myself in their shoes. I have to be equally passionate about what I\u2019m doing next, or what the heck is going to happen to me?\u201d",
