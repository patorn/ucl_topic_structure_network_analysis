  "body": "Amid all the Jane Austen reboots and\u00a0ripoffs, Jo Baker\u2019s 2013 debut Longbourn, which developed the events of Pride and\u00a0Prejudice from the\u00a0servants\u2019 perspective, seemed restrained yet revelatory. Fresh, fascinating and beautifully achieved, it\u00a0was that rare beast: a critical success with wide commercial appeal. What would one expect from the follow-up? Probably not a re-creation of Samuel Beckett\u2019s war years, from his desperation to leave the Ireland that stifled him, through his time in occupied Paris\u00a0working for the resistance and escape to the south after being betrayed to the Nazis, to his postwar job helping set up a French hospital. And always, through danger, penury and privation, the compulsion to\u00a0continue with writing that doesn\u2019t seem to be getting anywhere, that he is\u00a0driven to produce, as a writer friend puts it, like snails make slime. The book echoes Longbourn, though, in the way it takes a behind-the-scenes look at literature, animating the experiences that fed into Beckett\u2019s later work. Baker\u2019s close attention to physical experience, the deafening demands of the body during hard labour or hunger, is familiar from Longbourn, too, and pertinent to Beckett\u2019s aesthetic as it was to her story of Georgian England\u2019s less fortunate class. \u201cThe body\u2019s barest needs make for a heavy load,\u201d we are told, as, during the darkest days of the war, Beckett and his lover Suzanne D\u00e9chevaux-Dumesnil struggle on foot towards what they hope will be the safe haven of Roussillon. As they throw themselves on the mercy of strangers, \u201chuman bodies share the almost nothing that they have, and go on living\u201d. It is a daring project, to enter the mind of a man known for his withdrawal and silences, but Baker succeeds triumphantly in prose that is\u00a0both intimate and austere, with an unobtrusive Beckettian cadence. At the heart of the novel is Beckett\u2019s relationship with Suzanne, a lifelong companion and later his wife, yet of whom he\u00a0wrote in a 1939 letter to a friend: \u201cThere is a French girl also whom I am\u00a0fond of, dispassionately, and who is\u00a0very good to me. The hand will not be\u00a0overbid.\u201d His need for solitude and distance grinds against her combination of support and dismay \u2013 peeking into his notebooks, black with crossings-out, it\u00a0occurs to her that \u201call\u00a0that has been achieved here is the consumption of paper, ink and time\u201d. By\u00a0war\u2019s end, there is indeed a gulf between them, as well as exhausted familiarity. There is an unbearably poignant moment as they run, single file, from the Germans: \u201cHis arm is stretched back to her; she\u2019s tumbling forward to hold on to him. It\u2019s uncomfortable, constraining, it might be better to let go. They don\u2019t let go.\u201d In Deirdre Bair\u2019s Beckett biography she called Waiting for Godot, written a decade later, \u201ca metaphor for the long walk into Roussillon\u201d. Baker takes her title from the spartan description that sets the scene at the beginning of the first act, and Beckett and Suzanne\u2019s weary squabbling, over where they are to meet the contact who will get them over the border into the free zone, prefigures the double act of Vladimir and Estragon. \u201cMonsieur will surely come tomorrow,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cIt\u2019s tomorrow now,\u201d she replies. Baker has\u00a0Beckett look around the landscape, and project on to it the paintings of Van\u00a0Gogh and Rouault. We, in turn, are accustomed to seeing the horrors of the 20th century \u2013 such as the exodus from Paris, glimpsed here from a train as \u201ca rubbish dump, a mound of junk and clutter\u201d that separates into fleeing humanity \u2013 through Beckett\u2019s eyes. A wartime obsession with tattered boots and sore feet, with turnips gleaned from field edges, sucking stones held in the mouth against thirst all appear in\u00a0later novels as well as plays, while broader themes of stasis and stoicism are delicately foregrounded by Baker. The old man by whose side Beckett hides under floorboards, sharing a bottle to pee in, could be a character from his own pages: \u201cHe is a gracious pisser, and\u00a0a courteous sleeper; he does not fart as much as might be supposed.\u201d Beckett begins the novel in shame and apathy, hanging on the coattails of Joyce in a relationship that is a queasy mixture of adoration, gratitude and resentment (Baker gives us a nicely turned portrait of the ageing Joyce, fumbling along with his stick and glasses, \u201coblivious and uncanny and sharp as you like\u201d). His work with the resistance \u2013 where, as is pointed out, his \u201csilent habit\u201d is a virtue \u2013 demonstrates the power of words to change the world, as he collates the information that will \u201cconjure aeroplanes out of a clear sky \u2026 bring all hell raining down\u201d. He keeps his reports slipped into the manuscript of Murphy, \u201cwhich is by far\u00a0the safest place to keep something that he doesn\u2019t want people to read\u201d. Hindsight and the shaping of fiction perhaps give the novel an unduly uplifting arc, as it moves towards Beckett\u2019s famous epiphany when he realised that, in the case of his own writing, less would be more. Baker presents his time in Roussillon, when he wrote Watt, as years of mind-clearing labour rather than breakdown, as has been reported elsewhere. But though Beckett kept characteristically quiet about it after the war, the raw material is nothing short of sensational: hiding up a tree to escape the Nazis, seeing a\u00a0companion throw himself from a window to escape capture, digging a\u00a0roadside grave for dead German soldiers, disguising a case of explosives with potted geraniums ... Baker describes it all in wry, unruffled tones, taking Beckett towards the attitude later formulated as The Unnamable\u2019s \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t go on, I\u2019ll go on\u201d \u2013 as she puts it\u00a0here, life is \u201can act of resistance\u201d. Do you need to be interested in Beckett to engage with this novel? Well, as with the Longbourn servants, if you\u2019re not, you should be, because again this is an extraordinary story that\u00a0shines a light both on individuals caught up in the sweep of history and the way life is transmuted into art. Baker is a strange, determined writer, and I am fascinated to see what she does next. \u2022 To order A Country Road, A Tree for \u00a311.99 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
