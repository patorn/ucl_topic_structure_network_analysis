  "body": "Entirely new in Kronos\u2019s Barbican programme was Seiche by Martin Green (of folk group Lau), whose title refers to a form of wave and which made memorable use of two of Green\u2019s newly invented Kronoscillators \u2013 stretched out and amplified Slinkys whose sonic impact proved every bit as extraordinary as the sight of them being played by violinist David Harrington and cellist Sunny Yang. No less than six UK premieres featured, three of them written for the virtuoso ensemble\u2019s Fifty for the Future project, which will see as many composers creating pieces for student or emerging professional quartets. Among them were the increasingly complex My Desert, My Rose by Aleksandra Vrebalov; two movements from Garth Knox\u2019s Satellites, with its flaunting of extended playing techniques; and one from the traditionally based Sunjata\u2019s Time by leading Malian balafon player, Fod\u00e9 Lassana Diabat\u00e9, arranged by Jacob Garchik.            Other pieces making their UK debuts in the latter\u2019s arrangements were The Who\u2019s Baba O\u2019Riley (partly named in tribute to Terry Riley), and Laurie Anderson\u2019s Flow. Groung, an impassioned song of exile by the 19th-century Armenian monk and composer Komitas, was heard in a version by contemporary Armenian-American Mary Kouyoumdjian, who was also responsible for the evening\u2019s most powerful offering. Half reportage, half musical commentary, Bombs of Beirut made use of the recorded voices of Kouyoumdjian\u2019s family and friends as they recalled incidents during the Lebanese civil war; at its climax, the sounds of actual bombing exploded through the speakers into the hall \u2013 to shattering effect. \u2022 At Colston Hall, Bristol, on 13 May. Box office: 0844-887 1500. Then touring.",
