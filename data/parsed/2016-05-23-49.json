Elizabeth is not the only person to have thought a minor character might have a lot more to say if given the chance. Every actor playing the third spear-carrier on the right probably thinks their character is the pivot of the drama, and has worked out an entire backstory for them. A really good actor can make Celia seem infinitely more interesting than the lovelorn Rosalind; Banquo as complex as Macbeth. Playwrights play this game, too. Tom Stoppard did it most famously in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and Shakespeare\u2019s plays seem particularly ripe for this approach. Katie Mitchell, Alice Birch and Chloe Lamford\u2019s Ophelias Zimmer at the Royal Court reimagines Hamlet entirely from the view of Ophelia and the things she hears, sees and experiences from inside her bedroom. As the evening progresses, that space feels as if it is becoming smaller and smaller as she drowns in the screaming silence that comes with being a character in a play who has not been given a voice by Shakespeare. At a post-show discussion at the Royal Court, Mitchell said she was working with Martin Crimp on another production that aims to put another marginalised young woman \u2013 Miranda from The Tempest \u2013 centre stage.     Suhayla El-Bushra\u2019s The Iphigenia Quartet. Photograph: Helen Murray    In fact, there\u2019s a lot of it about. Jane Asher played the title role in CP Taylor\u2019s Ophelia at Oxford Playhouse in 1977, and a year later the feminist playwright Melissa Murray considered the character from a lesbian perspective. There have been some fascinating feminist perspectives: one of my favourites is Elaine Feinstein\u2019s Lear\u2019s Daughters, which takes you back to the sisters\u2019 childhoods and makes you understand why they behave the way they do in Shakespeare\u2019s play. Sometimes it\u2019s not even a minor character who gets to hold the stage, but one who never appears. Characters who traditionally appear only as off-stage figures suddenly find themselves in the spotlight, for example in Sharman Macdonald\u2019s After Juliet, which gives voice to a vengeful Rosaline, Romeo\u2019s first love who was brushed aside and so quickly forgotten. Helen Cooper\u2019s Mrs Vershinin reclaims a woman who never even manages to get on stage in Three Sisters and is described only through her unfaithful husband\u2019s eyes. Suhayla El-Bushra\u2019s play, one of four making up the Iphigenia Quartet at the Gate, all re-examine Euripides\u2019 Iphigenia in Aulis from multiple viewpoints, putting the shadowy victim centre stage. I\u2019ve always longed to see more of Regina in Ibsen\u2019s Ghosts and find out what happens to her, and I love the eccentric Charlotta in The Cherry Orchard who does magic tricks and knows so little about her past.  Which minor characters in major plays do you think deserve a place in the spotlight?",
