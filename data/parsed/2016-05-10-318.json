  "body": "Union members at Fairfax Media have passed a vote of no confidence in the company\u2019s management after up to 30 journalists were made forcibly redundant. Members of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) said they had lost faith in the ability of the chief executive, Greg Hywood, and the managing director, Allen Williams, to successfully execute revenue-raising measures. \u201cIt was a disappointing move by the company yesterday and a very tough day for Fairfax folks affected,\u201d said union organiser Katelin McInerney as staff held stop-work meetings on Tuesday in the wake of the cuts.

Editors in Sydney and Melbourne called journalists and artists in one-by-one and told them they no longer had a job, sources said. Some of those affected have worked for the company for decades. Award-winning illustrator Rocco Fazzari, who has worked for the Sydney Morning Herald for 25 years, was made redundant by the editor-in-chief, Darren Goodsir, on Monday. Fazzari, whose animated videos frequently go viral, posted on Facebook a picture of a tree being felled, and said he had most likely done his last drawing for the SMH.

I\u2019m not in a good space. Any support grateful.\u201d   In March the company announced it had to lose another 120 full-time equivalent staff and called for voluntary redundancies.

The MEAA says the target was reduced to 82 redundancies after negotiations but the company hasn\u2019t confirmed that figure. Fairfax has already lost 2,437 people since 2011, according to the company\u2019s annual report. In 2012, one in every four journalists left the newsroom after widespread redundancies. When the latest round was announced, staff at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age in Melbourne walked out in protest for three days.  Speculation that the weekday papers will cease being printed has grown in recent days and sources say the company will move to a weekend-only printing model for the SMH and the Age as early as February 2017. Hywood again raised the prospect of weekend-only papers in a speech last week. \u201cIt should surprise no one ... that the seven-day-a-week publishing model will eventually give way to weekend-only or more targeted printing for most publishers,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe are already seeing this happening offshore. Quite simply it is likely that one day, the viability for newspapers on current trends will run out. It isn\u2019t going to happen overnight \u2013 but eventually it will.\u201d Hywood said 65% of advertising revenue was generated on the weekend, except for the Australian Financial Review which was profitable on weekdays only.",
