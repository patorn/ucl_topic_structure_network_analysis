  "body": "Every month, Antonio pays a fee of about $3 a day for the right to drive his taxi in this city some 200 miles south of the Texas border. The payment doesn\u2019t go to his local government; it goes to the Zetas, an organized crime group with a reputation for violence so extreme that Antonio \u2013 like most locals \u2013 cannot even bring himself to utter their name. He never works nights \u2013 it\u2019s not safe to go out. Days are slow too: shootouts are common, and most people stay off the streets whenever they can.  But Antonio doesn\u2019t blame the lawlessness in Ciudad Victoria on organized crime. He pins the blame on Mexico\u2019s politicians \u2013 especially the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). \u201cThe feeling right now is that people are blaming the PRI for all that we\u2019re going through,\u201d says Antonio, while waiting for a fare at a taxi stand by the central square. \u201cNobody \u2013 and I mean nobody \u2013 likes the PRI.\u201d   Mexico cartels   Twelve Mexican states hold gubernatorial elections on 5 June, including Tamaulipas, where voters are flirting with the unthinkable: throwing out the PRI, which has ruled the state for 86 uninterrupted years.  The elections arrive as PRI president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s popularity hovers at historic lows and PRI candidates across the country confront upstart challengers in traditional strongholds. Exasperated residents say they\u2019re voting on local issues; in Tamaulipas that doesn\u2019t mean roads, taxes and schools \u2013 it means kidnapping, extortion and highways so unsafe no sane person travels without a convoy. The PRI has responded with attack ads and accusations that its rivals have ties to the drugs trade and armed groups.  The national PRI president, Manlio Fabio Beltrones, recently revoked the candidacies of three Tamaulipas mayoral candidates, who openly backed the National Action Party (Pan) campaign, alleging they were \u201cbought and threatened by criminals\u201d. Allegations of criminal complicity in the region are nothing new: two former PRI governors, Tom\u00e1s Yarrington and Eugenio Hern\u00e1ndez, face criminal charges in Texas courts and are considered fugitives from US justice. Prosecutors allege Yarrington accepted bribes to allow the Gulf cartel to smuggle cocaine into the United States, while Hern\u00e1ndez is accused of conspiring to launder monetary instruments. Both men deny any wrongdoing. And the irony of the PRI calling out its rivals as complicit with criminals isn\u2019t lost on the party\u2019s opponents.  They describe a parallel power structure in the state, charging for protection, setting up illegal highway checkpoints and even providing emergency relief in poor barrios after hurricanes hit. \u201cThere are two governments here,\u201d said former presidential candidate Josefina V\u00e1zquez Mota, at a PAN campaign event in Tamaulipas. \u201cThere\u2019s a government from 9am to 6pm and another from 6pm to 9am. The first was elected and the second imposes itself through kidnappings, extortion, disappearances, bullets and death.\u201d   Related: 'You can\u2019t trust anybody': the Mexicans caught up in the drug war just south of Texas    Shaped like a bloated No 7 and stuffed into the most north-easterly corner of the country, Tamaulipas was once known as the historic home of Mexico\u2019s oil industry, but is now notorious as a hotbed of corruption and contraband. Drug cartels have operated here for decades, but didn\u2019t prey on local populations or involve themselves in state politics until the 1990s. According to three opposition gubernatorial candidates, the rot set in when local parties turned to organized crime bosses for help in close elections.  \u201cPoliticians let them in so they could keep themselves in power. But these bastards started making demands on politicians,\u201d says Gustavo C\u00e1rdenas, a congressman running for governor with the small Citizen\u2019s Movement party. \u201cThey started demanding quotas \u2013 public works contracts, operating waterworks, transit police and municipal police. They [still] have a ton of people working for municipal governments,\u201d he said. Security in Tamaulipas unraveled in 2010 when the Gulf cartel\u2019s armed wing \u2013 Los Zetas \u2013 turned on their masters, ending the state\u2019s pax mafiosi and unleashing wave after wave of violence as splintering cartel factions contested territory.  The scale of the criminality is terrifying: thousands have died; entire busloads of travelers were hauled from the road and massacred; one cartel somehow installed a network of 120 security cameras in the city of Reynosa without the authorities intervening; gunmen overrun farms and kidnap every employee; an estimated 3,600 ranches in the state have simply been abandoned,  The bloodletting has also hit the political class: in 2010 the PRI candidate Rodolfo Torre Cant\u00fa (the current governor\u2019s brother) was assassinated on the eve of an election he was overwhelmingly expected to win. Everyone seems to have a story of violence. At a C\u00e1rdenas rally in Ciudad Victoria, Fernanda, an 18-year-old student who was fearful to offer her full name, said her pregnant half-sister and brother in law were killed in a 5pm shootout near her school earlier this year. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been justice,\u201d she said.

Social media has filled the information void: in some cities, Twitter lights up during shootouts. \u201cWe\u2019re still censoring in some ways,\u201d says Ram\u00f3n Cant\u00fa De\u00e1ndar, an independent mayoral candidate in Nuevo Laredo and former director of the newspaper El Ma\u00f1ana in the border city. The newspaper\u2019s editor was murdered in 2004 and its offices were attacked twice with grenades and assault rifles, forcing El Ma\u00f1ana to abstain from covering violence. Political coverage tilts toward the PRI \u2013 something three local reporters acknowledged during the PAN campaign in the oil town of Tampico.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been attended to well by the PRI,\u201d said one of the reporters, who described receiving payments from various mayoral candidates. Another member of the trio asked a Guardian reporter to relay a message to the Pan candidate, who was lunching at the same event: \u201cPlease tell him to look our way or we\u2019ll get rough with the Pan.\u201d A recent poll from Consulta Mitofsky put the Pan candidate, Francisco Garc\u00eda Cabeza de Vaca, in the lead. He campaigns in cowboy boots, snaps endless selfies with supporters \u2013 hands outstretched with the \u201chook \u2019em horns\u201d gesture from the University of Texas \u2013 and talks tough on issues such as corruption and insecurity. \u201cTamaulipas is in first place with the number of children aged 12 to 17 charged with federal offenses,\u201d which include drugs, weapons and organized crime, Cabeza de Vaca said a recent Pan rally in the oil town of Tampico. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something about this, these kids will become the next generation of hitmen, extortionists and kidnappers. We\u2019re condemning ourselves as a society.\u201d     Police patrol car escorts vehicles with civilians along the gang-infested Matamoros-Ciudad Victoria highway in Tamaulipas state. Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images    In a post-rally interview over beef nachos and bottled water, the Texas-educated Cabeza de Vaca switches easily between English and Spanish \u2013 though when talk turns to touchy security topics, he says, \u201cLet\u2019s talk in English,\u201d and lowers his voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s the risk? Fighting the system that\u2019s colluded with organized crime,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not fighting the PRI. We\u2019re fighting the system. There are more good people than bad guys. And we\u2019re gathering up the good guys.\u201d Cabeza de Vaca has himself come under scrutiny for the purchase of an apartment in Mexico City which the newspaper Reforma said was worth $2.7m. He has said the apartment was only worth $760,000 and has denied any wrongdoing.  But despite the opposition\u2019s upbeat rhetoric, the PRI machine is still formidable, plying poor voters with handouts \u2013 sacks of beans, rice and cooking oil \u2013 and warning those who vote for the opposition that they\u2019ll lose their social benefits. Fernanda, the student whose sister was slain in a shootout, says PRI activists threatened to take way her scholarship of 1,500 pesos per month if she didn\u2019t work on its campaign. The campaign of the PRI candidate, Baltazar Hinojosa, didn\u2019t respond to interview requests.  Back in Ciudad Victoria, a shoeshiner named Juan Carrizales gave his own reason for voting for the incumbents: \u201cThey brought cans of shoe polish.\u201d When asked about other issues such as corruption and insecurity, he pulled out a union card emblazoned with the PRI logo. \u201cWe\u2019ve always supported the PRI,\u201d he said.",
