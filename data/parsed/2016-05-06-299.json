Lego Movie directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller will be taking charge of the film, which is expected to be titled Han Solo: A Star Wars Story. On Thursday, Miller tweeted a shot of Solo\u2019s iconic blaster with the accompanying caption: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to get shooting!\u201d    Can't wait to get \"shooting\"!#MayThe4thBeWithYou pic.twitter.com/HlteYut6m0\u2014 Chris Miller (@chrizmillr) May 4, 2016    Ehrenreich, best known for his scene-stealing turn as a vowel-mangling western star in the Coen brothers\u2019s Hail, Caesar!, was only three weeks ago named as a contender to play the role made famous by Harrison Ford.  The Han Solo movie will be the second Disney-backed Star Wars spin-off to hit cinemas. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is due to debut on 16 December, with Lord and Miller\u2019s film set for release on 25 May 2018. Ford, 73, has played Solo in the original trilogy that hit cinemas between 1977 and 1983 and recent JJ Abrams blockbuster, The Force Awakens.",
