  "body": "The mother of a teenager who died while under the care of a heavily criticised mental health trust has been called a \u201cvindictive cow\u201d in a voicemail message left by someone claiming to work for the trust.  Dr Sara Ryan has been campaigning for accountability from Southern Health NHS foundation trust and its staff since her 18-year-old son Connor Sparrowhawk drowned in a bath at Slade House in Oxfordshire in July 2013, after an epileptic seizure. Connor, nicknamed laughing boy or LB, had learning difficulties.   Related: Neglect contributed to teenager's death at NHS unit, inquest finds    In December last year, an independent report commissioned by NHS England at the request of Connor\u2019s family reported that the trust had failed to properly investigate the deaths of more than 1,000 patients with learning disabilities or mental health problems over a four-year period, criticising a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d.  On Friday the NHS regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), said the trust was still not doing enough to protect people in its care. Just after 9.30am on the same day, Ryan received the abusive message from a female caller, a recording of which was posted on the Justice for LB website.  The woman said: \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing on the media about your son, your poor son that died in the care of Southern Health. I work for Southern Health and it\u2019s awful that you lost him, I\u2019m so sorry that you have done, it\u2019s tragic, and I hope you find some closure after the report, the issue of the \u2026 CQC report today. But I do think you are being very vindictive. I think you are a vindictive cow, on TV all the time slating the NHS, Southern Health.\u201d On her blog, Ryan wrote: \u201cThe call is vitriolic, nasty and beyond inappropriate. But it\u2019s simply part of a set of improbably inappropriate, nasty and worse responses we\u2019ve endured since LB died, evidence of a system in which defensiveness, bullying and family-crushing flourishes.\u201d A Southern Health spokesman said it was taking the matter seriously and planned to investigate the call. \u201cWe have been made aware of the phone message through social media, and the content is deeply concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trust cannot condone such behaviour and we take matters like this extremely seriously.  \u201cWe urge anyone with any information to get in contact with us so a full internal investigation can take place.\u201d A spokeswoman for Thames Valley Police confirmed that it had launched an investigation into the voicemail message.  She said: \u201cEarlier today as a result of a pre-planned meeting with Dr Ryan, TVP was made aware of a malicious telephone message made to her on April 29. This has now been recorded as a report of a malicious communication and is currently under investigation.\u201d  Southern Health\u2019s chairman, Mike Petter, resigned on Thursday before the critical report, saying he was doing so \u201cto allow new board leadership to take forward the improvements\u201d. On Tuesday, in the House of Commons, the shadow mental health minister, Luciana Berger, called for the trust\u2019s chief executive, Katrina Percy, to be sacked. She said very little had been done to improve the trust\u2019s performance.  In response, the health minister Alistair Burt said the CQC report made for \u201cdisturbing reading\u201d and the government had not ruled out the possibility of an inquiry. In October last year, a jury delivered a damning verdict, that serious failings and neglect had contributed to Connor\u2019s death.",
