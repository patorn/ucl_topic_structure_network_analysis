  "body": "So John Carver was right after all. A little over a year ago Newcastle United\u2019s interim manager claimed even a world-class coach would struggle at St James\u2019 Park and, sure enough, Rafael Ben\u00edtez has vindicated his theory. When, two months ago, Ben\u00edtez succeeded Steve McClaren, he had 10 games to keep Newcastle in the Premier League and, justifiably, fancied his chances. Nine of those matches later \u2013 two won, three lost, four drawn \u2013 the Tynesiders are relegated but this costly tumble into the Championship is not remotely the Spaniard\u2019s fault. In the circumstances Ben\u00edtez has done pretty well. His much improved team are on a five-game unbeaten run but the squad\u2019s flaws have proved too great to prevent the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager being relegated by Sam Allardyce\u2019s Sunderland.   Related: Sam Allardyce shows Sunderland escape route to spell doom for Newcastle | Louise Taylor    Had he been appointed slightly earlier things would have been different but, as it is, Ben\u00edtez is now deciding whether to exercise a break clause in his three-year contract and flee or put up with a season in the Championship with a club he has already fallen at least half in love with. After apparently being offered control of transfers as well as the green light to overhaul the academy, medical department and training ground, the indications are he may well say \u201cyes\u201d to Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner. Were this stance to be formalised before Sunday\u2019s home game with Tottenham Hotspur those fans who had planned to turn out en masse and beg Ben\u00edtez not to leave by serenading him for 90 minutes will find the pain of relegation anaesthetised. Yet should he walk away, the sense of the second-tier sabbatical being a case of merely having to postpone Newcastle\u2019s return to Champions League combat by an extra season will evaporate. Anger could be expected to complement the inevitable, crushing mood of anticlimax, with the new manager \u2013 and Hull\u2019s Steve Bruce is being mentioned \u2013 almost certainly regarded as a significant step down. Considering this is Newcastle\u2019s second relegation in seven years, the board\u2019s failure to insert clauses into players\u2019 contracts reducing salaries by around 50% in the event of losing Premier League status seems negligent. If anyone wants an example of hubris they need look no further than the St James\u2019 Park boardroom. The enduring high wages make unloading unwanted individuals more complicated. Take Henri Saivet. Recruited under Newcastle\u2019s old model whereby the manager had no real say in who came or went and the idea was to sign players aged 25 and under with potential resale value, the midfielder cost the best part of \u00a35m and earns \u00a335,000 a week. McClaren barely picked him, an unimpressed Ben\u00edtez does not deem him worthy of a place on the bench and buyers are hardly likely to be queueing around the block. All clubs make transfer market mistakes but Newcastle, with recruitment masterminded by Graham Carr, the chief scout, and Lee Charnley, the chief executive, clock up far more errors than most. Even worse, they appear to be strangers to the concept of building a team as opposed to collecting a disparate, disconnected band of individuals. Behaving like shoppers who snatch assorted pieces of sometimes ludicrously expensive designer clothing from rails without considering whether they may match or if colours will coordinate, the pair ended up creating the opposite of Leicester City.

Whereas Allardyce spent \u00a315m very well on Jan Kirchhoff, Lamine Kon\u00e9 and Wahbi Khazri in January, Carr and Charnley furnished McClaren with \u00a330m-worth of new blood in Saivet, Jonjo Shelvey, Andros Townsend and the on-loan Seydou Doumbia. Of that quartet only Townsend is starting games under Ben\u00edtez and Doumbia, borrowed from Roma, no longer travels with the squad. Of the \u00a350m summer spend, the \u00a312m winger Florian Thauvin is back on loan at Marseille and the jury remains out on Georginio Wijnaldum and Aleksandar Mitrovic. The biggest indictment, though, is that a squad already arguably hampered by the presence of too many francophone players were structurally holed. cCritically Ben\u00edtez\u2019s first few games in charge saw him forced to deploy midfielders at left-back. If it is no exaggeration to say that for want of a left-back Premier League status was probably lost, while the folly of refusing to consider signings in their late 20s upwards is highlighted by the 33-year-old Jermain Defoe\u2019s heroics at Sunderland. Granted, the former England striker possesses negligible resale value but by securing safety, his goals have been worth at least \u00a3100m to Sunderland. Ashley\u2019s decision to delegate football responsibilities to Charnley and Carr while using his public relations adviser, Keith Bishop, as a go-between, has backfired spectacularly. If questions must be asked about the futures of Charnley and Carr \u2013 although it is thought Ashley may reprieve the latter \u2013 the owner and Bishop would be unwise to try to engage Ben\u00edtez in hardball negotiations. Behind a warm, genial exterior the 56-year-old is a consummate political operator in whom the Sports Direct owner may have met his match. Unlike McClaren or Alan Pardew, Ben\u00edtez is not cowed easily and his slick personal website suggests he could teach Bishop a thing or two about PR.   Related: Newcastle \u2018devastated\u2019 by relegation, says managing director Lee Charnley    Unlike their Wearside neighbours, whose latest accounts showed a \u00a335m loss, Newcastle have recently recorded healthy profits (\u00a332m at the last count) and will benefit from next season\u2019s \u00a337m parachute payment available to clubs relegated from the top division. Further funds should also be recouped from the sale of players such as Moussa Sissoko, Wijnaldum, Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and Townsend \u2013 although the St James\u2019 hierarchy may fight to retain the latter \u2013 leaving Newcastle well-placed to rebuild a squad capable of bouncing straight back into the big time. Shelvey, bought for \u00a312m from Swansea City, wants to stay and could prove highly effective at Championship level but it should never have come to this. Not after spending \u00a380m in a single season. Trouble has to be faced, though; what matters now is somehow persuading Ben\u00edtez to stay before allowing him to implement far-reaching reform. The alternative is too agonising to contemplate.",
