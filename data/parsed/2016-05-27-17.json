  "body": "The room\u2019s single, overhead light is of such low wattage that reading small print becomes a strain and the gloom feels slightly oppressive. \u201cCan\u2019t we make it a bit brighter?\u201d inquires Steve Bruce, his sunny Geordie humour and Algarve tan suddenly out of step with the surrounds.   Related: How Sheffield Wednesday returned from wilderness to stand on brink of big time    As Hull City\u2019s manager settles into his chair, deep inside the KCom Stadium, things remain stubbornly dim but then someone quips: \u201cWin on Saturday and this club will be able to afford a few new lightbulbs.\u201d Should Bruce reaffirm his reputation as a promotion specialist by choreographing a Wembley play-off final victory against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday afternoon, his side will have returned to the Premier League one year after being relegated. It is all very different from 12 months ago when he offered Assem Allam and the Hull owner\u2019s son Ehab his resignation. \u201cThe old man talked me round \u2013 and Ehab too,\u201d he says, the tenor of his voice reflecting real affection for the 76-year-old Allem, who is seriously ill and will watch the final from a hospital bed. \u201cBoth he and Ehab wanted me to stay,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cBut I told them: \u2018Let\u2019s have a week to think on it\u2019, and that\u2019s what we did. We went away and then I came back and said: \u2018If you still want me to carry on, OK, let\u2019s have a crack.\u2019 \u201cI offered to fall on my sword because that\u2019s the right thing to do. I offered my resignation to make it easy for them if they wanted to make a change but they were adamant they didn\u2019t. \u201cIt was a difficult time, with all sorts of gloom and doom flying about the place, and people saying we could fall right through the divisions. I was worried there might be a fire sale but we were able to keep most of the squad together.\u201d Bruce\u2019s future, like Hull\u2019s, is again at a crossroads, with it uncertain whether he intends remaining in charge next season. \u201cWe\u2019ll speak about that after Wembley,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s talk of a takeover here being pretty close but whether that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Whatever happens \u2013 and the feeling is he is inclined to stay, particularly if Hull secure the \u00a3170m, some say \u00a3200m, prize that elevation to the top division offers \u2013 promotion would be dedicated to Assem Allam. \u201cHe\u2019s the reason I came here, his naivety and the way he was,\u201d Bruce says, smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s a genuinely good man. Who would have bought a club for \u00a340m when he could have had it for a pound? Only he could do something like that. Most people would have let it go into administration and let the debts not be paid, but he wanted them settled. He bought the club for the community. \u201cHe\u2019s let one or two issues upset a few people but he\u2019s made those decisions for the benefit of the club and I can\u2019t stress that enough. He\u2019s having a tough time at the minute, so if we can get promotion for him and his family \u2026 \u201d It would also help bolster an often overlooked city. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck out on a limb a little bit,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cNobody really gives a jot about Hull because of where we are geographically but promotion would put us back on the international map; the Premier League\u2019s overseas television audience is huge.\u201d Replugging the city back into the game\u2019s central grid and switching the lights back on by the Humber will not necessarily be easy. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have some big games as both a player and a manager,\u201d the former Manchester United captain says. \u201cBut, because of what\u2019s at stake \u2013 and the money washing about in the Premier League is quite unbelievable \u2013 this is my biggest for a long, long time. \u201cSheffield Wednesday have some very good players and they\u2019ll take a huge following to Wembley. I have to be honest and say I wasn\u2019t aware of Carlos Carvalhal [Wednesday\u2019s Portuguese manager] before this season but he\u2019s made a big impression.\u201d Bruce knows a talented Hull squad featuring, among others, Tom Huddlestone, Jake Livermore, Robert Snodgrass and Michael Dawson will have to cope with considerable pressure. \u201cOn the big occasions experience usually helps,\u201d he says. \u201cMake no mistake, though, even the experienced players and managers get themselves in a state; it\u2019s only human. It\u2019s then about how you deal with that pressure.\u201d Should Hull succeed in securing a place in the sun, Bruce will head for his villa on the Algarve harbouring a sense of \u201cabsolute relief\u201d next week. \u201cIf we win I\u2019ll celebrate a couple of days later,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the night you\u2019re too physically exhausted, you\u2019ve been through the wringer and even if you\u2019ve won, you feel horrendous.\u201d",
