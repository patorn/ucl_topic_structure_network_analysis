In the regional leaders\u2019 debate in Goulburn, the deputy prime minister suggested Labor and the Greens were \u201ccrabwalking\u201d to another live cattle export ban and then suggested the previous ban led to the flow of asylum seekers to Australia. \u201cMight I remind you when we closed down the live animal export industry, it was around about the same time that we started seeing a lot of people arriving in boats in Australia,\u201d Joyce said.   Related: Campaign catchup: big day for Barnaby    The ABC compere Chris Uhlmann replied: \u201cDo you realise you are suggesting the Indonesian government then unleashed the boats in response?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely the case that we created extreme bad will with Indonesia when we closed down the live animal exports,\u201d Joyce said. Uhlmann again asked: \u201cAre you suggesting the Indonesian government is sending refugees here?\u201d \u201cI suggest the Greens and Labor party created immense bad will and it was affected,\u201d Joyce responded. Joyce was debating Labor\u2019s agriculture shadow minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, and the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, after all three spent the previous days campaigning in regional seats. The topics ranged from the dairy crisis to the cost of data, the National Broadband Network, equal education access for rural students, Indigenous jobs, bringing immigrants to regional areas, climate change, renewable energy and coal and coal seam gas.  The debate began with the dairy crisis, with Di Natale suggesting a milk floor price could be considered. Joyce rejected the idea, given that a wool floor price caused a stockpile which caused a temporary collapse in the industry. Fitzgibbon said the agricultural cooperative Murray Goulburn\u2019s board was responsible for the current dairy crisis. Land usage questions drew applause. Di Natale called for an end to coalmining and coal seam gas, but Joyce said that although he agreed with a windfarm project in his electorate, he did not support a complete ban on coal and coal seam gas. \u201cThis is not a binary argument of banning it or allowing it,\u201d said Joyce.  \u201cI don\u2019t want mining on prime agricultural land. It needs to be protected. If you say banning mining or coal seam gas everywhere, I don\u2019t believe that because it will put a lot of people out of work.\u201d Fitzgibbon also advocated a case-by-case basis for mining \u2013 arguing that energy poverty meant Australia had valuable resources to offer countries such as India.

He named former National party leaders Mark Vaile and John Anderson, as well as Labor ministers Greg Combet and Martin Ferguson. \u201cYou think that is a form of corruption?\u201d asked Uhlmann. \u201cYou have to ask questions when you have this revolving door between our politicians and the coal and gas lobby and massive donations that flow back to the Labor party and to the Liberal National party from those fossil fuel interests,\u201d said Di Natale. During an argument about foreign ownership, Fitzgibbon accused Joyce of sending the wrong signals to the world when Australia needed to attract foreign investment.  Joyce asked what he meant, to which Fitzgibbon replied: \u201cI thought you went to a private school.\u201d  In response to a question about Indigenous employment opportunities, Joyce said \u201ceverybody wants to make sure we work with Aboriginal Australians\u201d.  \u201cI work with Aboriginal people in my area and assist them to get the fruits of their nation because they were here first.\u201d Di Natale urged Joyce to fund a program of 5,000 Indigenous rangers, while Fitzgibbon said the first step would be to fund the Gonski education model.  But one of the biggest audience responses of the night followed a question on the internet and the cost of data in rural areas compared with cities.   Related: NBN: the trouble with Coalition's plan for quicker and cheaper broadband    \u201cWhy do telecommunications [companies] charge $100 for a terabyte in the cities but [for] residents of small towns they charge nearly $10,000 for a terabyte?\u201d asked the audience member. Fitzgibbon said there was \u201cno bigger issue\u201d than network speeds and data.  \u201cUnder our NBN proposal we had a very important measure and the wholesale access would be equal whether you lived in the capital cities or deep rural Australia,\u201d he said.  \u201cBarnaby wants to get rid of that equalisation and people in regional Australia will be paying more. There is no greater divide between city and country than the transformation push effect of the internet.\u201d Joyce said data over wireless or fibre to the node was the same price, wherever it was used. \u201cIf you use wireless, you will pay the same price wherever you use it,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cIf you use fibre to the node, you will be paying the same price wherever you use it.\u201d On the eve of the debate, Joyce used his electorate to announce a dairy package which extends concessional loans previously used for drought, as well as the farm household cash payments worth $1,000 a fortnight.",
