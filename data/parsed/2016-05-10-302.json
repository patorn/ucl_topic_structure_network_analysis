  "body": "The major parties have spent much of the second day of the close-run election campaign accusing each other of cosying up to the Greens. And the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, insisted the hardline bipartisan stand on asylum seekers would not change, while Malcolm Turnbull used revelations that Labor candidates have argued for a more compassionate stance to raise what he said was a \u201chorror\u201d prospect of a future Labor government easing the policy under influence from the Greens.   Related: Today's campaign: first leaders' debate set as focus turns to economy    Turnbull has refused to rule out preference deals that would help the Greens\u2019 chances of winning inner Melbourne seats, even as the minor party gears up for a potentially pivotal role in a close election. The Victorian Liberal party director, Michael Kroger, had earlier released a statement that strongly implied such deals were under contemplation. The Coalition circulated on social media a photograph posted on Facebook by Labor\u2019s candidate in Herbert, Cathy O\u2019Toole, standing outside the office of local LNP MP Ewen Jones with a sign that said \u201clet them stay\u201d and \u201cbe fair to refugees\u201d. \u201cOn Friday morning I stood with my Amnesty International Australia friends peacefully demonstrating in support of a humane policy for refugees,\u201d O\u2019Toole wrote of the protest urging a change of policy on the 267 asylum seekers presently in Australia for treatment.  O\u2019Toole\u2019s post did not directly contradict Labor\u2019s policy but Turnbull leapt upon it \u2013 and positive remarks by the Greens lower house MP Adam Bandt about the last hung parliament from 2010 to 2013 \u2013 as evidence that Labor would water down its asylum policies under Greens\u2019 influence. Labor\u2019s policy is that no asylum seekers who arrive by boat will be settled in Australia and boat turnbacks should be used when it is safe to do so. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from Adam Bandt from the Greens that he\u2019s looking forward to a hung parliament,\u201d said Turnbull.  \u201cHe said the three years between 2010 and 2013 were effectively a golden era. He looked back to that with affection. Most Australians look back to it with a degree of horror, let\u2019s face it.  \u201cWhat will be the price of the Greens\u2019 pending deal with Labor, which they\u2019ve been promoting? It will be much higher taxes ... a relaxation of our border protection rules so we\u2019ll have the people smugglers back in business and of course he wants even higher carbon taxes than Bill Shorten is proposing.\u201d Campaigning with Shorten in Herbert, O\u2019Toole insisted she was 100% behind Labor\u2019s policy.   Related: Bill Shorten makes education a priority as Labor 'underdogs' hit campaign trail    \u201cI have been a member of Amnesty International for many years,\u201d O\u2019Toole said.  \u201cWhat I was saying at that point in time is very clear: I support the humane treatment of people regardless of whether they\u2019re refugees or not.  \u201cWe treat people humanely. I do not support people making extreme amounts of money by extortionate measures and risking people\u2019s lives.\u201d Shorten said Labor would be \u201ccompassionate\u201d but would never allow the reopening of the \u201cdangerous seaways\u201d between Indonesia and Australia. \u201cWe will support boat turnbacks where the border forces deem it appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is part of our general plan. We will, after 2 July, if elected, keep the people smugglers out of business. \u201cWe will be compassionate in the way we treat refugees in this country but what we will never do is allow the opening of the dangerous seaways between Java and Christmas Island.\u201d But Liberal strategists believe raising doubts over Labor\u2019s stance on asylum have given them a strong start in the marathon campaign and Labor campaigners are concerned they have been on the defensive over the issue. At the same time, Turnbull refused to rule out recurring reports that his own party has done a deal to direct preferences to the Greens in the Victorian seats of Batman and Wills in return for the Greens not preferencing the ALP in a clutch of outer-suburban marginal seats, a move that would give the Liberals a stronger chance of winning them.  Turnbull insisted the matter would be determined by his federal director, Tony Nutt. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking about preferences, the federal director will decide how preferences are allocated,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cObviously when we know who\u2019s nominated. That will be done in the usual way, in consultation with the organisation.\u201d Nutt issued a statement which also avoided ruling out the option. He said \u201cvarious parties\u201d always \u201chad discussions\u201d but it was wrong to say that a deal had been done.  Preference decisions would be made after the close of nominations \u201cconsistent with the electoral interests of the party, our values, principles and priorities and the best interests of the Australian people in having an effective national government,\u201d Nutt said. \u201cAt the appropriate time the Liberal party will publish its recommendations and they will then decide what choice to make.\u201d The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has used a similar formulation, insisting preference arrangements are a matter for local campaigns and it was possible some would decide to run \u201copen tickets\u201d and not direct preferences to either major party. But the Victorian Liberal president, Michael Kroger, suggested a deal was in the offing, telling Sky News his party was \u201cnot running a charity\u201d for Labor although no decision had yet been made to preference the Greens. Shorten said the Liberal-Green deal showed that Labor was in the centre of the Australian landscape.

Both Turnbull and Shorten ruled out forming government in collaboration with the Greens. \u201cThere is absolutely no chance \u2013 yes we can rule out any collaboration with the Greens to form a government but I can tell you Labor won\u2019t and Labor can\u2019t and if they did no one would believe them,\u201d Turnbull said. Asked whether he would consider forming a coalition with the Greens in a hung parliament for minority government, Shorten said \u201cno I wouldn\u2019t\u201d. \u201cCan I put it another way to Mr Bandt and the Greens \u2013 tell \u2018em they\u2019re dreaming,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cNo deals with Labor about forming a coalition.\u201d But Bandt countered that, saying \u201cBill Shorten can say that we\u2019re dreaming, sometimes dreams come true. And if the Australian people decide that they want a parliament where there are more than two voices who largely say the same thing then the obligation is on all of us to work together\u201d.",
