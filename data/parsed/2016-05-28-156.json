I\u2019d been hoping for at least a bleat of recognition \u2013 the electric car I\u2019d borrowed was branded with a cartoon version of the Lake District\u2019s Herdwick sheep. But while its charm was lost on the woolly natives, it worked a treat on the human ones. Every time I slowed to pass a group of walkers or cyclists, their smiles and waves gave me a sense of comradeship I could never have earned as a motor-car user in a national park renowned for its traffic problem. I\u2019d collected my car-in-sheep\u2019s-clothing at the Quiet Site, a green-minded camp- and glampsite overlooking Ullswater. One of a new \u201cflock\u201d of 10 battery-powered hire cars at campsites and attractions across the northern Lakes, the Renault Twizy resembles a space buggy crossed with a golf cart (pale grey, with sheep\u2019s head painted on the bonnet). After mastering its push-button technology, I set off towards Keswick on quiet lanes. As I headed up past Little Mell Fell, then down into Matterdale, my gaze was torn between the mountain backdrop, dominated by the tent-shaped outline of Blencathra, and the electronic screen above the steering wheel. A battery symbol with an arrow pointing out of it shows the power you\u2019re draining by putting your foot on the \u201cgas\u201d. Go downhill, however, and the arrow changes direction as the battery recharges, offering a great excuse for a few seconds\u2019 freewheeling, savouring the sound of birdsong and bleating instead of roaring motor.     The Twizy managed to climb Honister Pass, at the price of a drained battery. Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA    Eight local businesses have leased these two-seater sheepmobiles as part of an initiative called See More, whose aim is not only to reduce carbon emissions but also to make the Lake District more accessible to car-free travellers: the Quiet Site, for example, picks up campers from Penrith station. But there\u2019s a catch. A Twizy can do 40 miles on a full charge, if you go sensibly. Driving fast or uphill drains the battery faster than a thirsty fell walker can knock back a water bottle. I\u2019d been planning to tackle Honister Pass, but by the time I reached Keswick, having put my foot down to the maximum speed of 52mph on the busy A66, I\u2019d used half my juice. The helpful folk at the Quiet Site had foreseen this and advised a refuelling stop at Castlerigg Hall, a smart camping park overlooking Derwentwater. All the \u201cflock\u201d hosts recharge vehicles from other sites for free. (It costs about 80p to power up a Twizy, which uses a standard three-pin socket, so there\u2019s nothing to stop you asking other venues to plug you in while you have a drink or meal.) But it takes about 3\u00bd hours to charge, so even after lingering over coffee and cake in the campsite\u2019s excellent cafe, I still had time for a one-hour tramp to the top of Walla Crag and back, for a ravishing view over Derwentwater and sparkling Bassenthwaite beyond. I set off along the Borrowdale road having been warned to watch the meter. This was the first time a Twizy had attempted Honister, the campsite staff told me (most hirers trundle along the valley bottom for a pub lunch and back). By the time I reached the pass, I noted smugly that the battery was 90% full. I was brimming, too, from the sheer fun of getting to grips with this dinky vehicle, whose dimensions and unobtrusive quietness (you have to beep at roadside walkers or they won\u2019t hear you coming) were so well-suited to the narrow, leafy roads. Calculating that it would cost me less than a fifth of what it costs to fuel my own filthy car, I fantasised about getting one for the school run. Then I hit the one-in-four gradient and flattened the accelerator. The car slowed markedly as it climbed two miles of vertiginous zigzags, devouring the battery at an alarming rate. Then, the weather took a turn that was dramatic even by Lake District standards: the blue sky turned slate grey and hailstones the size of sugar cubes started falling. By the time I arrived at Honister Slate Mine, they were pinging through the gap in the flip-up car door and gathering round my feet. It was a dramatic way to discover quite how outdoorsy the Twizy experience is. Unheated, with zip-off plastic windows, the car puts you at one with the elements, good or bad.

Photograph: Alamy    One of a growing list of Twizy-friendly businesses happy to offer its sockets to members of the fleecy fleet, Honister is also Cumbria\u2019s adrenaline hotspot, with its rock-face via ferrata and wire-rope bridge strung across a 600-metre gorge. I declined both of these tempting ways to pass a couple of hours\u2019 charging time. Instead, as blue skies returned, I made a cheat\u2019s ascent of Haystacks, Alfred Wainwright\u2019s favourite fell. Honister is so high that I was already halfway to the summit, with its views over Buttermere, Crummock Water and a hit parade of famous mountains. Happily I\u2019d stashed my walking boots and OS maps in the Twizy\u2019s tiny luggage compartment. Later, as I looped down towards Buttermere village and cruised along the curvaceous Newlands Pass back to Keswick, I reflected that one of the best things about taking out a Twizy is all the things you can do while you\u2019re charging it. You might need to plan your route carefully, but you\u2019ll meet more people, see more scenery and develop a more mindful approach to eating up miles in a landscape that\u2019s not cut out to be a thoroughfare. It\u2019s slow travel, in the best sense of the word. \u2022 Twizy hire costs \u00a310 an hour, \u00a330 a half day (four hours) or \u00a345 a day (eight hours).
