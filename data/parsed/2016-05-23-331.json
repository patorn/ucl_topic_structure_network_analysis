  "body": "Labor has signalled it will move to minimise the potential for double dipping when politicians own or rent properties in Canberra \u2013 and has challenged the Coalition to do the same. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, told reporters on Monday current practices involving MPs claiming travel allowances and pursuing deductions were not in line with community standards, so \u201cthis needs to change going forward\u201d. The prime minister rebuffed Labor\u2019s overture while campaigning in the marginal New South Wales seat of Eden-Monaro \u2013 but while campaigning in Sydney Scott Morrison told reporters he would be seeking particulars from Labor about what it was proposing.   Related: Politicians 'double-dipping' on property claims aren't breaking rules \u2013 Cormann    \u201cWe\u2019ll be in contact with [Chris Bowen\u2019s] office, that may already have occurred so we can see exactly what he is proposing,\u201d the treasurer said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll have a look at exactly what he is proposing.\u201d A ruling from the tax office allows MPs who rent in Canberra to also claim deductions for a second residence including \u201clease payments; rent; interest on borrowings used for the acquisition of the property; rates; taxes; insurance; general maintenance of the building, plant and grounds\u2019\u2019. The ruling \u2013 which applies to federal, state and territory MPs \u2013 not only allows the interest in the second property to be tax deductible, it also allows the sale of the property to be capital gains tax free. Over the weekend, Labor argued in favour of the staus quo. Various frontbenchers said the system for parliamentary entitlements should continue to be determined by independent tribunals, not by politicians. But the opposition has now shifted. Bowen said the practices, which were the subject of critical media reports over the weekend, were not in line with community standards, community standards were important, and \u201cwe will make that change\u201d. He said the tax office ruling had been in place for many years but it was important \u201cgoing forward that it be reflecting community standards.\u201d   Related: Guardian Live election special event with Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy    \u201cNow that this has received the appropriate amount of, if you like, scrutiny, it\u2019s clear in Bill\u2019s [Shorten\u2019s] view and in Labor\u2019s view this needs to change going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI invite the government to make the same commitment.\u201d Labor is looking specifically at the section of the tax office ruling dealing with second residences. It is unclear how Labor could make changes to a system that has been determined independently by the tax office. One option could be legislation, another could be a request to the tax office by an incoming treasurer for a new ruling. Speaking to reporters on the far south coast of NSW, Malcolm Turnbull initially rebuffed Labor\u2019s overture. \u201cI see Labor has done an overnight backflip on this.\u201d Turnbull argued that it was very important that politician\u2019s pay and entitlements be set by independent tribunals, not by the politicians themselves. The prime minister confirmed on Monday that he had claimed travel allowance while staying in a Canberra apartment he owns during sitting periods. \u201cI\u2019ve received the per diem allowance for being in Canberra, yes.\u201d \u201cI have certainly made those claims, and I have conducted my affairs scrupulously in accordance with the rules that apply to all members and senators,\u201d Turnbull told reporters.   Related: Nick Xenophon calls for penalties in politician entitlement scheme    But Morrison sounded more open to the proposal. He said the government would seek particulars of Labor\u2019s position. \u201cYesterday Labor said it should be set by an independent process and I note the comments made today by Chris Bowen, and we\u2019ll be in contact with his office \u2013 that may already have occurred \u2013 so we can see exactly what he is proposing,\u201d the treasurer said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll have a look at exactly what he is proposing. That\u2019s not clear to us yet.\u201d \u2022 Join Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy in Sydney and Melbourne as they host our Guardian Live election special event featuring a panel of prominent political guests",
