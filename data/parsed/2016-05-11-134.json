  "body": "This image references a 1602 Baroque still life by Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n titled Quince, Cabbage, Melon and Cucumber. It\u2019s a very cerebral painting, because he was trying to create a sense of perfect static balance. It must have taken an awfully long time. My photograph was\u00a0an act of destruction, taken at an unthinkable speed. I decided to use a\u00a0pomegranate, instead of a quince, because a pomegranate would explode\u00a0like a grenade. I took it after a long period in Ukraine, photographing the landscapes my grandfather-in-law would have seen when he survived the Holocaust. Soon after, my son was born. I was travelling a\u00a0lot, and I think I became more introverted. This image came from a need to produce a moment of destruction that\u00a0would also be a moment\u00a0of creation. The bullet was captured at 1,600\u00a0frames per second, a speed we cannot perceive with the naked eye. So\u00a0the image requires a suspension of disbelief. In my photography, I try to explore the relationship between the virtual and the real, the physical and the metaphysical. All my work has a direct connection with my upbringing in Israel, and\u00a0this idea within the Jewish diaspora of a\u00a0utopian place we can never quite obtain \u2013 the return to a place that doesn\u2019t really have any material presence in the world, and that\u00a0can\u00a0never be realised. I left Israel when I was 21, in 1988. I\u2019ve lived in the UK for 28 years. My position changed \u2013 from an Israeli who lived in Israel to\u00a0someone who chooses to live outside Israel. I went from living there\u00a0to looking back and reflecting. I\u00a0began to ask what it meant to live in\u00a0such a place. But, in Britain, I\u00a0was suddenly a foreigner, an outsider. A lot of people in\u00a0Israel see it as very important to take\u00a0a side, to say \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m there\u201d. I want to explore the liminal spaces in between. Photography has the\u00a0ability to create something new and unique \u2013 a fusion of the two. I looked at the paper this morning. There was a picture of a bus full of people, blown up in Jerusalem. My daughter saw it, and was mesmerised. She wanted to see more. Violence can be grotesque, but also incredibly, intensely attractive. I wanted this image to be similarly hypnotic. Destruction is painful, but it can be very cathartic.

High point: \u201cThe exhilarating realisation of a new body of work, which is uplifting, inspiring and often charged with optimism.\u201d Low point: \u201cThe day after the opening of a new exhibition, when new possibilities seem to diminish.\u201d Top tip: \u201cConstantly search for purpose, never let go of moral responsibilities, always remember that every little gesture of good will is vital for the wellbeing of our shared reality.\u201d \u2022 Ori Gersht\u2019s Floating World is at Ben Brown Fine Arts, London W1, until 16 June.",
