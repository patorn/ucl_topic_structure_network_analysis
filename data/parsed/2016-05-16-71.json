They\u2019re usually condemned to the dustbin of history, but, as proved by Outside the Lines, a book that collects outtakes from album cover shoots of the late 70s and early 80s, they frequently tell their own story, distinct and occasionally more truthful than their more famous siblings.      David Bowie during the photoshoot for his 1979 album Lodger. Photograph: Duffy Archive    Sometimes, they\u2019re suggestive of the pains to which some artists went to get the right image \u2013 the disturbing cover of 1979\u2019s Lodger was achieved by David Bowie lying on a specially made metal support and being pressed beneath a pane of glass \u2013 and sometimes they\u2019re telling about the internal dynamic of the band involved. In one outtake from the Parallel Lines shoot, Debbie Harry looks down, adjusting her dress, her hair covering her face, but she somehow still completely dominates the photo: she still feels like the centre of attention, even when she\u2019s looking away.     Debbie Harry and Blondie during the photoshoot for 1978\u2019s Parallel Lines. Photograph: Edo Bertoglio    The street-tough image projected by the Ramones\u2019 debut album cover was so pervasive that when the band arrived in London in 1976, Johnny Rotten allegedly asked their associate Arturo Vega if he thought they would beat him up: \u201cHe thought the Ramones were a real gang,\u201d Vega subsequently chuckled. The question would never have arisen had Rotten seen the rest of the photo shoot, where the Ramones look rather sweet and impish.     An outtake from the Damned\u2019s 1977 debut album Damned Damned Damned. Photograph: Peter Gravelle    For all that the artists and photographers involved clearly made the right decision when selecting their cover shots \u2013 would the Specials\u2019 eponymous debut album have had quite the same impact if it had featured the band posing a little awkwardly on the roof of a cinema? \u2013 there\u2019s something fascinating about the shots they left behind. They\u2019re simultaneously familiar and jarringly different; too revealing to be kept under wraps.     Iggy Pop (left) in an outtake from the photoshoot for his 1982 album Zombie Birdhouse.
