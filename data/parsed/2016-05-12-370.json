  "body": "A crowdfunding campaign to \u201cbuy Duncan Storrar a toaster\u201d has raised nearly $60,000 and prompted the founders to consider seeking tax and financial advice for its beneficiary. The Go Fund Me campaign was set up on Tuesday to raise the money for Storrar, the Q&A audience member whose question about tax-free thresholds for low-income earners mobilised social media.   Related: Crowdfunding raises $35,000 to buy Duncan from Q&A a toaster    The target was set in response to assistant treasurer and Q&A panelist Kelly O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s passing reference to a \u201c$6,000 toaster\u201d on the program. It raised more than $35,000 in its first 24 hours. As of 5pm on Thursday the figure stood at almost $60,000 from 2,372 individual donations. Nicholas Oliver, an Australian based in Hong Kong, who set up the page with his friend Samuel Fawcett in Melbourne, said the response had exceeded all their expectations. \u201cWe thought maybe people would kick in a little bit and it would be a nice story \u2013 a way to have a go at the government a little bit. \u201cWe did not think that everybody would get on board the way they did.\u201d Oliver, who identifies as a \u201cLabor or Greens voter\u201d, said O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s response to Storrar\u2019s question on Q&A was \u201ckind of ridiculous\u201d. \u201cIt just goes to show how he really tapped into a feeling that\u2019s out there, that I think politicians maybe haven\u2019t been able to sense.\u201d Oliver and Fawcett are now in the position of having to decide when to end the campaign. As of Thursday morning it was continuing to receive donations in regular intervals. They are in touch with Storrar, who, Oliver said, did not seem to want to be the centre of media attention. \u201cHe just wanted to say how overwhelmed he is and grateful.\u201d He told them he intends to spend the funds raised on educating his two daughters, aged eight and six, and a family holiday. He also said he planned to donate \u201ca large portion\u201d of it to a family he said \u201cbroke [his] heart\u201d with their attempts to help him after his appearance on Q&A.   Related: You're not a 'bludger' if you pay no net tax in Australia    Oliver said they intended to consult with \u201cprofessionals\u201d \u2013 he suggested founders of successful crowdfunding campaigns, tax lawyers, and accountants \u2013 about how best to manage the transfer of the funds. Ironically, given Storrar\u2019s question to the Q&A panel, it is not likely to be subject to tax, instead being classified by the Australian Taxation Ofice as a one-off donation or gift. The Australian reported on Wednesday that Storrar pays no net tax, given that he earns less than $18,200 a year. But, after an injection of more than $55,000 \u2013 more than the median annual disposable income for a single person ($43,836) \u2013 that may change. It could also affect Storrar\u2019s eligibility for the Austudy allowance: a fortnightly payment of $520, subject to an assets test, which is reportedly his only regular source of income. This \u201cwas a real concern\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cThat\u2019s why we want to get professional advice, just to make sure we don\u2019t burden him in any way.  \u201cEven if everyone is supportive, it must be difficult to be this famous all of a sudden.\u201d The Australian on Thursday published an interview with Storrar\u2019s estranged son, Aztec Major, in which the 20-year-old said Storrar did not \u201cdeserve\u201d the donations and had used drugs. The crowdfunding platform GoFundMe deducts 5% of the total raised while Stripe, the payment processor, takes a further 1.75% plus $0.30c per donation.",
