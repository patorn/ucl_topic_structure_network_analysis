  "body": "It was the first week in March 1991 and my army unit was told that Operation Desert Storm was over. I was relieved the war had ended; I looked forward to going home and seeing my family again. We had been in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for three months; but before we could leave, we needed to repair our vehicles and ship them back to Germany, where we would be heading. Then word reached us that a soldier in the Rafha refugee camp run by the US army, in northern Saudi Arabia, needed help: he\u2019d been operating a fork lift for weeks and was desperate for a break. It was only for three days, so I offered to cover. We flew there in a helicopter and, as I climbed out, the guy I was replacing ran past me and jumped in, saying, \u201cSee you, buddy!\u201d Three days later, there was no sign of him. I couldn\u2019t check where he was with my superiors, because I had no walkie-talkie or mobile. Everything in the military is on a need-to-know basis, so I didn\u2019t question it \u2013 I was 22 at the time. I was stationed at a site at the bottom of a hill, about 700m from where the soldiers were staying: I slept there in my forklift to guard all the supplies and a tanker full of diesel fuel. It was a makeshift camp and I wasn\u2019t reporting to anyone, just driving there from my post. Trucks would drop off supplies at my site and leave. I had left one platoon behind and I wasn\u2019t part of the platoon in the camp; I was very much left alone. I didn\u2019t have daily contact with the soldiers because I was quite far away. I was there for about six weeks; they didn\u2019t know me and I didn\u2019t know them. My job was to protect supplies, not stay in the camp, so I somehow slipped through the net. One morning I was bringing food and water to the camp as usual, only to find it was deserted. There had been at least 2,000 people, but they must have left in the night. Staying at the bottom of the hill, I hadn\u2019t heard any activity; often the wind was so strong you couldn\u2019t hear much. The barbed wire that enclosed the camp was gone. There were a few broken tent poles left and empty water bottles. I took a photo on my disposable camera. I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t survive, at least someone will see where I spent my last days.\u201d I honestly believed I was going to die. So many thoughts ran through my head: how could this have happened? But I wasn\u2019t angry for long. I put all my effort into trying to come to terms with the situation. I had a supply of ready meals and water, and figured I had enough food for three months, four at most. I had a cassette player and batteries, and my Bible. I did pull-ups to keep fit and I started driving as far as I could go each day, drawing a terrain map to try to find out where I was. That was risky, because the sandstorms regularly changed the landscape. One morning, I was out driving and thought I saw a sandstorm coming, but knew that it was far too early. I swerved to the left of it and drove as fast as I could. Then I realised it was a convoy of trucks with two tanks. One fired a warning shot at me, but I kept going. As they got closer, a man shouted, \u201cMan, where the hell did you come from?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, just get me out of here first!\u201d They were US army. I got in one of the trucks. As I told them my story, we passed the white bones of a camel. The driver said, \u201cThat could have been you.\u201d It turned out I\u2019d lost track of time: they told me it was May; I\u2019d been alone for about two and half weeks.   Related: Experience: I ran a medical trial that went wrong    Eventually, I rejoined my unit in northern Germany. When I stepped through the door, one of the guys fell to the floor in amazement \u2013 he thought he\u2019d seen a ghost. Most of them thought I had died. No one has taken responsibility for abandoning me, and there was no investigation. So much for the army adage, \u201cWe never leave a soldier behind.\u201d I originally joined the army because I had been abused as a child, and I wanted to prove to myself no one could hurt me again, and that I could protect people. I now know no one can break me, but I will never get over feeling utterly abandoned. \u2022 As told to Kate Connolly Do you have an experience to share?
