  "body": "Nearly 1,000 people were killed in attacks on health centres worldwide over the past two years, almost 40% of them in Syria, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday in its first report on what has become a growing issue. The UN agency documented 594 attacks resulting in 959 deaths and 1,561 injuries in 19 countries with emergencies between January 2014 and December 2015.  Syria, where a civil war has raged since 2011, had the most attacks on hospitals, ambulances, patients and medical workers, accounting for 352 deaths. The Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank, as well as Iraq, Pakistan and Libya, followed. An estimated 62% of all attacks were deemed intentional and many led to a disruption of public health services.

The majority of these are intentional,\u201d Dr Bruce Aylward, executive director of the WHO emergency programme, told a news briefing.  \u201cIt is also not stopping and it has real complications for what we are trying to do. It is getting more and more difficult to deploy people into these places, it is getting more and more difficult to keep them safe when they are there and it is getting more and more difficult to ensure they survive, let alone recover in crises.\u201d  The casualty figures include 42 killed and 37 wounded in a US air strike on a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan last October.  A US military report last month said that the incident did not amount to a war crime but was caused by human error, equipment failure and other factors, but MSF has called for an independent inquiry.  The charity\u2019s anger over the repeated targeting of medical facilities in warzones \u2013 and the lack of a concerted political response \u2013 was among the reasons it gave for withdrawing from this week\u2019s inaugural world humanitarian summit in Istanbul. The WHO said 53% of the attacks were perpetrated by states and 30% by armed groups, with the identities of those behind the remaining 17% unknown.  \u201cOne of the most important rules of war you is that you don\u2019t attack healthcare facilities, healthcare providers, the sick, the disabled. So these attacks do represent gross violations of international humanitarian law,\u201d said Rick Brennan, WHO director of emergency risk management and humanitarian response.  He added: \u201cViolations of international humanitarian law, if proven, can be considered war crimes and the perpetrators can be taken to the international criminal court.\u201d",
