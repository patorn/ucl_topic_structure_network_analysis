  "body": "Bill Shorten has said he accepts a recommendation to dump Labor\u2019s candidate for Fremantle, unionist Chris Brown, because he was \u201cnot forthcoming with the truth\u201d about prior convictions. According to the West Australian, Brown failed to disclose convictions from the 1980s, including pleading guilty to assaulting a police officer during an altercation and drink-driving. The assault conviction was later expunged but Brown received a 12-month good behaviour bond, it said. Guardian Australia has confirmed Labor will disendorse Brown. On Thursday, Brown said he had been charged with assault but not assault of a police officer. He said he had been king-hit at a festival in Clermont.  \u201cI was the victim in the incident and fortunately there was a police officer that had contact made with him,\u201d he said. Brown also claimed \u201cthe only reason the ALP is aware of is is because I\u2019ve been open and honourable about this process\u201d. But Shorten said: \u201cIt is on clear that serious matters the candidate wasn\u2019t forthcoming with the truth to the Labor Party.\u201d Shorten said he \u201cagreed 100%\u201d with the national secretary\u2019s recommendation to dump Brown as the candidate. Brown is a freight and logistics worker who has spent the past 12 months as a campaign coordinator for the Maritime Union of Australia. He won the preselection battle for Fremantle, beating Josh Wilson, a former staffer for the current Fremantle MP, Melissa Parke. Wilson, who is Fremantle\u2019s deputy mayor, beat Brown in a local ballot in March but the MUA candidate won endorsement at the ALP state council. Shorten said the party would make a decision on disendorsement today. \u201cThey will do so and I believe that Josh Wilson,the deputy mayor of Fremantle, will be a very good candidate in Fremantle,\u201d he said.   Related: Cowan's curious contest: how a changing electorate could help decide the election    Fremantle is held by Labor on a 4.8% margin. Is is one of just three seats Labor holds in Western Australia, compared with the Coalition\u2019s 12. It is being targeted by the Greens, whose candidate, Kate Davis, was a lawyer for the UN and an outspoken critic of Labor\u2019s support of the offshore detention model. Brown\u2019s preselection had been a cause for some consternation for some Labor members, who felt he was an unnatural successor to Parke, a former human rights lawyer. Davis has attempted to exploit the view she is Parke\u2019s more natural successor. \u201cI think Melissa Parke is known in the electorate for her advocacy in relation to human rights, particularly with regard to refugees,\u201d she told Guardian Australia for an earlier feature on the electoral contest.  \u201cHer justified anger was outspoken regardless of whether that was in contravention of Labor party policy. I think people saw her as an advocate with integrity.\u201d On Monday, Brown brushed aside concerns about his preselection. Brown said he believed he was fit to represent Fremantle because he had a \u201cvery good understanding\u201d of the suburb, where his family first settled in 1851. \u201cI am not someone who has come in from outside,\u201d he said. Brown was contacted for further comment about the disendorsement.  After discovering news of the disendorsement, Davis said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the Labor party chooses as its candidate in Fremantle, that candidate is still bound by the party\u2019s policies, including offshore detention of asylum seekers and a weak climate policy.\u201d",
