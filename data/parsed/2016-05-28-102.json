  "body": "Around 11pm, on a temperate Friday last August, Officer Troy Owens was patrolling south-eastern San Diego. Peering through his driver\u2019s side window into the darkness, he scanned the streets until his eyes stopped on the corner of 47th and Market. \u201cSomebody trying to hide from me?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cYup,\u201d he answered, swinging the SUV around, and turning on the flashing lights. Owens, who has worked for the San Diego police department for nearly 20 years, pulled toward the curb and got out of his car. As he approached, three teenagers slowly slunk out from behind an electrical box: a boy, David, 15, whose identity, along with those of other minors, is being protected, and two girls. Heads hanging, shoulders slouched, they knew they were caught. All three were soon searched, handcuffed, and put in the back of cars for the ride to the command post \u2013 a local Boys & Girls Club. Were the teenagers picked up for using drugs? No. Drinking? No. Had they fled a store without paying for their goods? Hardly. Their crime: being out past curfew. In San Diego, it\u2019s illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to be out past 10pm. And, that night, Officer Owens was part of a \u201ccurfew sweep\u201d, where teams of officers fan out and enforce the law en masse. The city runs these details roughly once a month in each of its nine districts, sometimes arresting dozens of kids a night. David and his friends said they were just walking home. But that isn\u2019t one of the exceptions \u2013 like a school sports game or a job \u2013 so Owens read him his Miranda rights. Conceived as a crime-reduction tactic, curfews were promoted during the \u201ctough on crime\u201d era of the 1990s. In 1996, President Bill Clinton flew out to Monrovia, California \u2013 among the first cities to claim curfew success \u2013 to publicly endorse the idea at the local high school. From there, they spread like wildfire and remain in place decades later.  From Baltimore, which has one of the strictest curfews in the country, to Denver, where curfew enforcement ramps up every summer, the laws are on the books in hundreds of cities across the US. According to available FBI data, there were 2.6m curfew arrests from 1994 and 2012; that\u2019s an average of roughly 139,000 annually. Philadelphia alone reported 16,079 violations in 2014 \u2013 among the highest in the country. As the curfew laws and arrests proliferated, however, the debate about their impact simmered largely out of view. Congress left curfews unaddressed in pending juvenile justice legislation and, today, the question remains: are they the best approach? \u201cIt\u2019s insane. No other country does this,\u201d said Mike Males, a senior researcher for the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice and curfew critic who would like to see the practice come to an end. In his research, he says he hasn\u2019t seen \u201cany evidence\u201d that they\u2019re effective; instead chalking up their use to political expediency. \u201cCurfews became this way of responding that both blamed young people and didn\u2019t affect adults.\u201d An American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) case study of Minneapolis found the city\u2019s curfew to be racially biased \u2013 with 56% of curfew charges coming against black youth compared with 17% for their white counterparts, despite the city being majority white. Males says that he\u2019s found a similar pattern nationally. \u201cThey\u2019re always racially discriminatory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not found a single exception to that.\u201d Tau Baraka owns the Imperial Barbershop just down the road from the Boys & Girls Club. He\u2019s lived here in south-east San Diego for years and views curfew sweeps as part of a broader police assault on the predominantly non-white community. \u201cI worry,\u201d he said, emphasizing that between curfew sweeps and gang enforcement details, \u201cwe see our youth being harassed daily.\u201d Proponents, however, argue that curfews help prevent young people from becoming either perpetrators or victims of nighttime crime. \u201cThis is an important way of helping kids stay safe and stay out of trouble,\u201d said San Diego city councilmember Marti Emerald. \u201cIf we can help one child in their struggle then I think that we have to say the program is at least a partial success.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 When they arrived at the command post, police took down David\u2019s name, age and contact information. Two new cadets were in charge of logging his possessions, and putting them in a bag for safekeeping. After Officer Owens filled out a police report, he swapped David\u2019s metal handcuffs for plastic ones and moved him to a chair in the middle of the auditorium. Girls on one side, boys on the other; all waiting for a \u201cresponsible adult\u201d to pick them up. As for punishment, curfew violators are offered a diversion program, upon completion of which their case is dropped. \u201cWe try to do a proper assessment of the whole situation,\u201d said Lt Evan Ziegler, with the department\u2019s juvenile administration. When kids come to class, police can also connect them to social services, job trainings or activities that aim to keep them otherwise engaged. In the south-eastern division, free diversion classes are held on Tuesday evenings and range from a juvenile judge talking about the court system to corrections officers detailing what life in \u201cthe hall\u201d is like. The six-week course finishes with a visit from the coroner, whose slideshow from the morgue paints a grisly picture of the worst-case scenario. Parents are required to attend a separate set of classes, which are held in both English and Spanish. \u201cAt least [the police] got them,\u201d said one mom, as week two of the diversion program let out. Two of her sons were picked up for breaking curfew. \u201cThey\u2019re with them. They\u2019re not out there,\u201d she said in support of curfews before rushing off to pick up her other child \u2013 a move that alludes to what can often be the complex reality of curfew violations. Police have stopped three of Michelle Ruiz\u2019s kids. One got a ride home, another was offered diversion and the third was sent to court and fined. \u201cI understand that they\u2019re doing it for our kids\u2019 safety,\u201d said Ruiz. \u201c[But] it makes it harder for us.\u201d She says that multiple jobs, single parenting and a myriad of other challenges can make it difficult to monitor kids\u2019 adherence to curfews or complete subsequent diversion programs. The inconsistency has left Ruiz unsure whether curfews are having a net-positive effect. Kids in San Diego seem to be conflicted about curfews as well. Even though she\u2019s been caught twice, Ashley, 19, generally endorses the law. \u201cWhat\u2019s there out after certain times?\u201d she asked, rhetorically. \u201cTrouble.\u201d But, she notes, her interactions with police were far from enjoyable and she still gets stopped sometimes just because she looks underage. \u201cIt was really kind of scary to have them treat you like a hardened criminal.\u201d Brian and his friend Demare\u00e9, both 16, are fairly indifferent. They were waiting for the trolley at about 9pm but weren\u2019t nervous about the looming curfew. \u201cI do my best to stay inside,\u201d said Brian. \u201cBut, for the most part, no one really cares.\u201d In common refrain, Demare\u00e9 adds that he hadn\u2019t even known there was a curfew law until he got stopped coming home from a party. Officers let him off with a ride home. Tonight though, leniency was in short supply. \u201cHappy hunting,\u201d was how commanding officer, Sgt Jay Moser, kicked off the sweep at the Boys & Girls Club. By 10.13pm four kids were under arrest and six more came in throughout the night. That\u2019s an average number, says Moser. Some nights it\u2019s higher \u2013 the division record is about 50. Others it\u2019s lower, especially recently. \u201cThat\u2019s not a failure,\u201d Lt Ziegler says of the decline in numbers, which is probably a combination of police getting the word out about curfews and kids becoming more savvy at avoiding sweeps. \u201cBasically it means that we\u2019re doing our jobs.\u201d Bardis Vakili with the ACLU of San Diego questions the premise that curfews, and curfew sweeps, are the best tactic. Calling the approach \u201cvery heavy-handed\u201d, he says that it has a lasting effect on kids. \u201c[What is does] is cite them, offer diversion programs that are difficult to complete, and ends up in involvement in the criminal justice system,\u201d he said, suggesting expanded after-hours options for youth instead. At the very least, he would liked to see \u201ca real dialogue\u201d around the topic. One problem is that analysis of curfews is relatively scant, and opinions often fall in the more emotional realm. \u201cIt\u2019s a gut-level sort of response,\u201d said Councilmember Emerald, when asked about her support for the laws. \u201cIt\u2019s not real scientific, is it?\u201d The data though, does exist, with the California Criminal Justice Statistics Center (CJSC) keeping detailed statistics stretching from 1980 to 2014. While officials in San Diego reject the notion of racial bias in the city\u2019s curfew law, a Guardian analysis clearly shows that it has a disproportionate impact on minorities, especially Hispanics. In 2010, Hispanic youth accounted for 59% of all curfew arrests, as opposed to 16% for white youth. Comparatively, census figures for the same year put the city\u2019s population at 28.8% Hispanic and 45.1% white. The data also shows that diversion programs are indeed keeping more kids of all races out of the courts. In 2011, a majority of curfew cases were handled within the department for the first time in decades. That trend has continued, with only about a third of curfew cases going to juvenile probation 2014. As to whether the curfew actually reduces crime, critical findings like Males\u2019s are often countered with University of California professor Patrick Kline\u2019s research, which concludes that \u201ccurfews are effective at reducing both violent and property crimes.\u201d The Voice of San Diego took perhaps the closest look at the situation locally. A  2012 article challenges the alleged benefits, finding that \u201cneighborhoods without the sweeps have reported greater drops in crime in the last five years than those with them.\u201d Males says that, again, he\u2019s seen a similar, broader, pattern in his research. Noting that between truancy laws and curfews kids could conceivably only be allowed outside for a few hours a day, he says, \u201cthe underlying assumption [is] that most youth are criminals.\u201d For the officers and volunteers at the Boys & Girls Club, however, there\u2019s a palpable sense of accomplishment. Packing up and turning off the lights, they head home for the night with a hope that they\u2019ve helped \u201cjust one kid\u201d \u2013 even if the public is more skeptical. \u201cWhat are the results?\u201d asks one agitated patron at the Imperial Barbershop. \u201cWhen you come over here with a heavy police presence \u2013 a military presence \u2013 the community deserves to know.\u201d Regardless, with summer vacation on the way, curfew enforcement is soon set to ramp up again across America.",
