  "body": "\u201cIn Concepci\u00f3n we had two earthquakes: the 8.8 one and the social earthquake \u2013 looting, arson \u2026 I think the last one affected our soul most violently,\u201d said \u00c1lvaro Ortiz Vera, the mayor of Concepci\u00f3n, a coastal city in Chile hit by a major quake in February 2010. While traditional disaster risk management meant the city was well prepared in terms of strict building codes, limiting damage and loss of life, what was not foreseen was the total breakdown of communications networks. With critical services like water, electricity and sewerage networks severely disrupted, officials were unable to communicate with each other, coordinate help from the government in Santiago or keep the public up-to-date with what was happening. Reports of food shortages and theft escalated into looting and panic, until the military were brought in to restore order. What traditional risk management missed became clear, though, when Concepci\u00f3n used the City Resilience Index (CRI), a new tool developed and launched today by engineering consultancy Arup for the Rockefeller Foundation. \u201cConcepci\u00f3n had done all the things you\u2019d expect an earthquake-prone city to do in terms of building codes and emergency management, but the weakness that emerged [from the CRI assessment] was that their telecommunications systems were all reliant on broadband internet,\u201d says Jo da Silva, Arup\u2019s director for international development. \u201cWhen that failed in the quake, the whole city information stopped and there was a lot of social disruption as a result. A normal analysis of disaster risk reduction would never have unearthed that.\u201d    The alternative to resilience is failure, it\u2019s urban collapse  Jo da Silva     The CRI measures a city\u2019s resilience. Participants (usually municipal governments) answer 156 questions covering issues from health and wellbeing to economy and society, infrastructure and ecosystems to leadership and strategy. How affordable is transport? How robust is planning? How much green space is there? Answers to these questions \u2013 both qualitative and quantitative \u2013 give the city a holistic \u2018resilience profile\u2019. It is not a single aggregate score, but what da Silva at Arup likes to explain as a representation of the city\u2019s immune system. Arup analysed 22 cities during the development of the tool and tested the finished index on five diverse cities around the world: Liverpool in the UK, Hong Kong, Arusha in Tanzania, Shimla in India and Concepci\u00f3n. In Shimla, for example, the hillside capital of Himachal Pradesh in the Himalayas, 35 city and state departments came together with academics and NGOs to complete the assessment. Weaknesses were identified in sustainability and planning, and healthcare was highlighted as an area of concern.     Shimla\u2019s resilience profile. Illustration: Arup    Arup is keen to stress, though, that the index is not about judging cities, or comparing performance across cities; instead it\u2019s about creating a community of users who are able to improve performance in their own city, and then share their experiences with others. The five pilot cities were deliberately not chosen from the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s 100 Resilient Cities programme, which announces its final tranche next week. Any city can complete the CRI using the online tool \u2013 which helps guide multiple users to collaborate over the input of data \u2013 and the hope is that more cities will get involved. \u201cThe CRI goes beyond preparedness,\u201d da Silva explains. \u201cResilience is about recognising we\u2019ve got to be ready whatever happens. You need to create cities that function well today and will continue to function irrespective of what happens. It may be the arrival of 200,000 refugees, it may be a major flood, or it could be an economic downturn. We can\u2019t bury our heads in the sand until those shocks and stresses occur. We want to make sure cities are prepared to deal with both the expected and the unexpected. How we manage that, recognising the fact that the majority of people live in cities, is for me the agenda that is going to define the 21st century.   Related: Judith Rodin's warning for the world: 'Crisis is becoming the new normal'    \u201cThe alternative to resilience is failure, it\u2019s urban collapse. When you look at the human consequences of that \u2013 whether it\u2019s in cities like Detroit, that suffered an economic collapse, or Port-au-Prince in Haiti, which had a physical collapse \u2013 you are talking about events that affect hundreds of thousands of people. Urban failure of any sort is on the scale of major natural disasters.\u201d Sundaa Bridgett-Jones, associate director of international development at the Rockefeller Foundation, says the CRI has evolved as a diagnostic tool to fill the gap left by existing methods which tend to concentrate on easily quantifiable scientific measurements and focus on single hazards. The complex world of resilience doesn\u2019t lend itself to aggregation into a single score or ranking, and there is much of value which cannot be quantified as a sum of money or a percentage. \u201cGrowing numbers of city leaders really want to be able to look at the full spectrum,\u201d she says, \u201cto see where they are, and help them make decisions. They want to deal with challenges now and challenges that are coming \u2013 that may be weather, climate change, economic growth \u2013 but also to be able to deal with stresses and shocks that are unforeseen. \u201cThe index allows cities around the world to assess where they are. Once they\u2019ve completed a profile, they can see they\u2019re strong in some areas and weaker in others. They can talk to other cities and share their knowledge, and we hope to be able to see what\u2019s working and identify solutions.\u201d Guardian Cities is a member of the Habitat III Journalism Project.
