  "body": "The treasurer, Scott Morrison, claims Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy will \u201ccrash\u201d confidence in the economy because it will undermine property values so much.   Related: How negative gearing replaced the great Australian dream and distorted the economy | Greg Jericho    He has also denied housing affordability will improve if property values grow more slowly, as they are supposed to do under Labor\u2019s policy. He made the warning just hours before the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, arrived in Canberra to ask the governor general for writs to be issued for a federal election. Housing policy will be one of the key battlegrounds of the election. \u201cIf you want to crash confidence in the economy, go and play around with the value of the family home, which is what Labor\u2019s proposal, their housing tax proposal, does,\u201d Morrison said on Sunday. \u201cThe problem is that household consumption is driving our economy. In the December quarter national accounts, 0.4% out of the 0.6% growth, that was related to household consumption.\u201d \u201cA big housing tax will undermine consumer confidence, undermine people\u2019s own home values, and have all sorts of disruptive impacts on the economy,\u201d he said. Morrison\u2019s attack on Labor\u2019s policy was similar to the dire warnings from Turnbull who claimed in February that homeowners across the country would see the value of their homes \u201csmashed\u201d by Labor\u2019s \u201cvery blunt, very crude\u201d idea. Turnbull claimed at the time the consequence of Labor\u2019s policy would be a decline in property prices, warning \u201cevery home owner in Australia has a lot to fear from Bill Shorten\u201d. He was later criticised by economists and public policy experts for being hyperbolic. The Grattan Institute released a paper last month showing if the capital gains tax discount was reduced from 50% to 25%, and if negatively geared investors were no longer allowed to deduct losses on their investments from labour income, house prices would grow 2% more slowly than they otherwise would. But Morrison said on Sunday a 2% reduction in house prices was not immaterial.   Related: Scott Morrison: 'I won't \u200bapologise to Save the Children'    \u201cI hear people say even at the modest level, that it might only be, say, 2,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, 2% on the value of someone\u2019s home. I mean, that can be anywhere between $10,000 and $20,000. That\u2019s someone\u2019s entire interest payments, and more. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll take too kindly for that to be wiped off the value of their home.\u201d Labor wants to limit negative gearing to new properties and reduce the capital gains tax discount from 50% to 25%, in a bid to improve housing affordability. It says working and middle-class families are increasingly being priced out of the housing market, with first home buyers making up just 1 out of 7 of all home purchases.  \u201cOwnership rates for young people aged 25-34 have spiralled downwards in recent years from 60% to 48%. Young people are being forced to take on levels of debt unimaginable just a few decades ago,\u201d Labor says.",
