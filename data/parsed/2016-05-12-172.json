  "body": "Julian Bliss. Photograph: Ben Wright    David Bruce has been on UK audiences\u2019 radar most recently as a composer of operas for young people \u2013 The Firework Maker\u2019s Daughter, and Glyndebourne\u2019s Nothing. Gumboots, written in 2008, is a quintet for clarinet and strings in which he looks to Gumboot dancing \u2013 born out of how black miners in apartheid South Africa, forbidden to speak, communicated by slapping their boots and chains. After a long opening movement of heat haze, come five increasingly complex dances, reverberating with the smack of wood and bow on string and with the wheeling, almost klezmer-like playing of Julian Bliss, who flits seamlessly between regular and bass clarinet. The joyous rhythmic barrage of the finale could almost be out of a Falla ballet. Brahms\u2019s Op 115 Clarinet Quintet is an odd counterweight; Bliss and the Carducci Quartet offer a worthwhile, well-balanced performance with especial spark in the third movement.",
