  "body": "The new head of the RSPCA has pledged to continue passing information about illegal fox-hunting and farm cruelty to the police but said that in the past the charity had struck the wrong tone when championing animal rights. In an attempt to redefine the organisation\u2019s role following complaints it has become too political, Jeremy Cooper confirmed that, in future, cases would usually be handed over to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether they should be brought to court. But Cooper did not rule out private prosecutions against hunts if the CPS did not act, clarifying comments that had been attributed to him in an interview with the Daily Telegraph where he had appeared to rule out doing so.  In a statement released on Monday, Cooper said he accepted that \u201cwe got the tone wrong sometimes\u201d but said that it would \u201cmake no apologies for prosecuting people in instances where there is clear evidence of animal cruelty\u201d. On hunting specifically, Cooper added: \u201cFollowing an independent review of our prosecution activity and in line with one of the recommendations of that review, RSPCA trustees agreed to change its policy and to pass suitable cases involving traditional hunts and suitable farm cases to the police for investigation, enabling the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute if appropriate. However, we reserve the right to proceed with such investigations, if the authorities fail to act.\u201d The new chief executive\u2019s statement that the RSPCA used to be too political was welcomed by the Countryside Alliance but prompted an online petition by anti-blood sport campaigners calling for his immediate resignation.  The controversy over the hunt\u2019s activities has focused on the private prosecution it brought in 2012 against the Heythrop Hunt \u2013 based in David Cameron\u2019s constituency and with which the prime minister used to hunt. It cost the charity \u00a3327,000 to bring the case.    Cooper explained: \u201cThe matter involving the Heythrop Hunt was a successful prosecution and the hunt were found guilty \u2013 we stand by our decision to take action on that case. \u201cWe do however apologise for the specific incidents where we have got it wrong. As a charity we have limited resources and we are dealing with huge numbers of calls. We apologise for past mistakes where an investigation wasn\u2019t carried out to the standard we would hope, both for the animal involved and their owners.\u201d Cooper said the RSPCA was still opposed to the badger cull. \u201cWe believe that vaccination, increased levels of testing and improved biosecurity are more effective ways of dealing with bTB [bovine tuberculosis] in the long term,\u201d he said. Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, welcomed Cooper\u2019s comments. \u201cBy saying that they are not going to be prosecutors of first resort, they have accepted that the days of private prosecutions are over. \u201cThe direction of travel [in the RSPCA] suggests they will be moving out of private prosecutions altogether. You can\u2019t have a non-statutory body with no checks and balances as the default prosecutor for a great tranche of legislation,\u201d he said.   But Penny Little of Protect our Wild Animals, who was one of the hunt monitors who collected evidence for the Heythrop prosecution, responded to Cooper\u2019s earlier interview in the Daily Telegraph by launching an online petition calling for his removal. \u201cThis has caused such a storm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic and looks like capitulation to bullying ever since the Heythrop Hunt were prosecuted by the RSPCA. You don\u2019t parlay with hunts; you don\u2019t meet them halfway. [Cooper\u2019s comments] have caused convulsions.\u201d  Other animal charities promised they would continue to prosecute. Philip Mansbridge, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said: \u201cIn an ideal world the Hunting Act would be clearly enforced and charities would not need to be bringing private prosecutions which can be lengthy and costly. \u201cWe have always looked at evidence on a case-by-case basis; with hunts often using very established loopholes in the law to avoid prosecution, such as the false alibi of trail hunting, it can be difficult to get a successful conviction.\u201d Under the 2004 Hunting Act, killing mammals with dogs is outlawed. A maximum of two dogs can be deployed to flush a fox towards someone who will shoot it. Despite a promise by the prime minister that there could be a free vote on overturning the Hunting Act, opposition by a small number of Conservative MPs and the Scottish National party ensures that it would not pass in this parliament. Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \u201cThe most recent Ipsos Mori polling in December 2015 found that over eight out of 10 people want hunting to remain illegal, with 84% in rural areas wanting it to stay banned and seven out of 10 Conservative supporters opposed to hunting.\u201d \u201cInstead of pandering to the tiny but well-connected hunting lobby the prime minister should start listening to the public, drop the government\u2019s pledge to have a vote on hunting, and instead commit to proper enforcement of the Hunting Act.\u201d",
