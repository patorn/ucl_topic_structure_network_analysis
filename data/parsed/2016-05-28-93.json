The video, purportedly filmed by a bystander during a protest in Toulouse on Thursday, shows the woman crossing a pavement before the officer pushes her shoulder and seemingly grabs her by the neck. Her head is thrown back and she is rammed against a railing before falling to the ground. The protests are against Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s planned labour bill, which aims to make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers, and which was forced through parliament without a vote this month. Fuel shortages sparked by days of nationwide refinery strikes and blockades are easing across the country after several fuel depots were liberated by police, but the transport minister, Alain Vidalies, told journalists that although \u201cthe situation is getting better\u201d, the crisis wasn\u2019t over. On Friday riot police swept away a blockade of burning tyres at an oil depot near a Total refinery in Donges, western France. Police have cleared all 15 blockades around the country, leaving only one depot still shut by a strike.  \u201cUnblocking these depots will allow an increase in delivery capacity to resupply more and more petrol stations,\u201d a transport ministry spokesman said.  Six of France\u2019s eight oil refineries were still either closed or operating at reduced capacity due to ongoing union action. Hollande said he would not give in to unions\u2019 demands to withdraw the measures, which he has said will loosen France\u2019s rigid labour market, cut red tape and tweak rules that deter employers from hiring. \u201cI will stand firm because I think it is a good reform,\u201d Hollande said at the G7 summit in Japan. \u201cOur primary duty \u2026 is to do everything to maintain the supply of fuel to the public and to continue to provide essential public services.\u201d           Why is France being racked by strikes and protests over its labour bill?    In Paris on Thursday riot police arrested 16 people and fired teargas at about 100 people on the edge of a protest march. Several masked people smashed shop windows and cars were damaged near the route of the march. There were skirmishes at Place de la Nation as riot officers cordoned off protesters, some of whom complained of heavy-handed policing.   Related: Riot police crack down on Paris protests against labour reforms    Police estimated that between 18,000 and 19,000 people took to the streets in Paris, while unions put the figure at 100,000. Street marches took place in other towns and cities including Toulouse, Bordeaux and Nantes.  A recent poll found that seven out of 10 people in France still oppose the labour reforms, but Parisians\u2019 patience for strikes appeared to be running dry. \u201cThe CGT [union] presents itself as representing the people, but they are only 3% of the workforce,\u201d pensioner Genevieve de Maud\u2019huy told AFP. Carine Zarkout, an engineering student, said: \u201cWe are suffering the collateral damage. Lots of people \u2026 are losing money every day.\u201d Benjamin Pastor, an estate agent, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know who is being polled. If they call people\u2019s homes, it\u2019s people who are either unemployed or who aren\u2019t affected.\u201d France is due to host around 2 million visitors at the Euro 2016 football championships in two weeks\u2019 time. Unions have called for rolling strikes on the Paris Metro to start on the day of the opening match on 10 June. British motorists taking road trips to France this bank holiday weekend were advised they should \u201cfill up to the brim\u201d at the last petrol station in Dover. France\u2019s civil aviation body appealed to airlines to fuel up abroad before arriving in Paris from European destinations to ensure they could make the return flight. Air France said the measure was precautionary. \u201cThere is no shortage at this stage,\u201d the airline said.  Strikes at nuclear power stations\u2013 which provide three-quarters of the country\u2019s electricity \u2013 have so far failed to affect supply, authorities said.  The employers\u2019 federation Medef expressed growing anger over the effect the strikes were having on France\u2019s fragile economic growth. Medef\u2019s chief, Pierre Gattaz, condemned the \u201cthugs\u2019 methods\u201d of the unions and urged the government to \u201cresist their blackmail\u201d. The prime minister, Manuel Valls, has insisted the legislation will not be withdrawn, but said it might still be possible to make changes or improvements.",
