He has argued that recent terrorist attacks and mass shootings would have played out differently if more of the victims had been armed.  The candidate has said that he has a permit to carry a concealed weapon in New York, no easy feat in a city with draconian gun laws, and that he wants concealed carry permits issued in any individual state to be valid nationally. But when Trump addresses a crowd of tens of thousands of National Rifle Association members at the group\u2019s annual meeting in Louisville on Friday, he will be facing a group of politically engaged conservatives with very mixed feelings about Trump\u2019s record on guns \u2013 including some NRA members who worry that gun rights are just another bargaining chip that the dealmaker might trade away.  Ryan Baumgarten, 29, an NRA member from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said he was skeptical that Trump is a true second amendment supporter.  \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard for me to believe, because, you know, he\u2019s a New York person,\u201d he said. \u201cHe says his sons are NRA life members. I don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ve been members for. I don\u2019t know if the guy\u2019s ever really shot a gun.\u201d  \u201cUsually, people are pretty loud about it if they\u2019re shooters ... It\u2019s like a long legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never really heard Trump say anything about it for a while before the election.\u201d  As they gathered in Louisville Thursday night for a fundraising dinner to support the NRA Foundation, other NRA members said they trusted Trump\u2019s gun rights record. They saluted his blunt honesty and pointed to his sons, whose African safari hunting trips have attracted criticism, as proof that the Trumps are a gun-friendly family. One man suggested, laughing, that all Trump needed was to choose NRA board member Ted Nugent, a rock star who has come under fire for antisemitic social media postings, as his vice-president.  But others said they were still waiting to hear what Trump had to say before they made their decision \u2013 or that they were frankly worried that their rights would be safe under President Trump.  It wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s previous endorsement of an assault weapon ban that these NRA members said made them nervous, but his broader approach to politics.  David Kopel, a lifetime NRA member and prominent gun rights expert and attorney from Colorado, said in an interview Wednesday that he did not know how long Trump\u2019s gun rights fervor would last if he made it to the White House.  \u201cHe\u2019s so obviously non-ideological that it\u2019s hard to count on him maintaining any position for long when it might become politically inconvenient,\u201d he said.  If Ted Cruz had won the nomination, Kopel said, he was confident that Cruz would have appointed staunch gun rights advocates to the supreme court \u2013 and done the same with federal judges.  But he could \u201ceasily see\u201d Trump cutting a deal with Democrats on the supreme court nominee: \u201cYou pass the bill I want to start a trade war with China, I\u2019ll give you some other judge more to your liking.\u201d  Lower court judges would be even more of a concern, he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a Trump White House doing anything with lower federal court judges other than crony appointments in tradeoffs for other things that they want.\u201d  Kopel\u2019s concerns were echoed outside the NRA Foundation dinner Thursday night by two NRA members from Hartford, Wisconsin, who said they had no idea what Trump stands for when it comes to gun rights.  \u201cWe\u2019re both a little concerned about Donald Trump. We think that he is a corporate dealmaker, which means he\u2019ll go wherever he thinks the greatest deal is,\u201d Kurt Konkel, 71, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the greatest deal is for him on the second amendment.\u201d  Konkel said he did not like the idea of a president governing through \u201ccorporate give and take.\u201d Trump \u201cthinks that\u2019s going to be good government, because that\u2019s what he\u2019s used to.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility I might not color in the circles on either one of them and just vote for our state senator and our representative and the townspeople and everything else that\u2019s running, but not vote for president, period,\u201d said John Edelblute, 77. \u201cI don\u2019t like Trump and I don\u2019t like Hillary.\u201d  Doubts about Trump or not, several other NRA members on Thursday night said they would be voting for him.  Paul Ludasher, 59, from Michigan, who said he had been an NRA member for 30 years, said he was not sure how sincere Donald Trump\u2019s stance might be on the second amendment. But he did have a pretty clear sense of Hillary Clinton\u2019s.  \u201cBetter the devil that you don\u2019t know than the devil you do,\u201d he said.  \u2022 The NRA refused to issue Guardian US with accreditation for its annual convention.
