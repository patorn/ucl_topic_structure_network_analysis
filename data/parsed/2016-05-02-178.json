On the outskirts of Edinburgh, the coach and former Federation Cup captain reflects on the fact her sons, Jamie and Andy, occupy the world No1 and No2 slots in, respectively, the men\u2019s doubles and singles rankings. Last week she and Jamie took the Davis Cup trophy, which the Murray brothers and Great Britain won amid high emotion six months ago, to their home town of Dunblane. Memories flooded through them. They also could not forget the terrible day 20 years ago when Jamie and Andy were at Dunblane primary school and 16 of their fellow pupils and a teacher were killed in a mass shooting. It seems incredible that, beyond such carnage and coming from a rainy Scottish town without any tennis history, such success followed for the Murray boys.   Related: Judy Murray on the Dunblane massacre: 'I just left the car and ran'    \u201cWe speak about it very occasionally,\u201d Judy Murray says. \u201cBut, last Christmas, Andy said: \u2018You know, mum, it really is amazing what\u2019s happened.\u2019 They were home for Christmas and it was cold but Andy got up that morning and went for a run. He ran from the Bridge of Allan into Dunblane. He ran around Dunblane, going past the primary school, the high school, the post box, the cathedral where he got married and then back past the tennis courts. There was a family playing on the tennis court with two little boys. Andy went on to the court and had a hit with the kids. He had his beanie on and no one else knew he was there. \u201cAndy then went back up to my mum and dad\u2019s for breakfast. It was probably that run which brought it home to him. He was thinking that was our little club \u2013 with no track record of success. There was no one to learn from and that makes their success so special. It was just after they had won the Davis Cup, so these emotions were very vivid.\u201d Those same feelings ran deep again when Judy and Jamie returned to Dunblane with the Davis Cup which \u201cis like a giant wedding cake. It has to be brought in a van and it takes about 45 minutes to get it on and off the van. It was a great day. I\u2019d asked Jamie where he would most like to go and he said the primary and senior schools and then end up at the club. \u201cIt was emotional for me and lovely to see Jamie being recognised. For so long he has been in the shadow of Andy and so it was great to see him being the centre of attention. And anytime I go back to the tennis club I feel the most emotion. Apart from a lick of paint the club looks exactly as it was when they were small boys. I can see them running around while I was coaching. I remember them playing in the men\u2019s third team when they were quite little.\u201d There is much more than nostalgia at work here. Murray has only recently stepped down from her Federation Cup duties, and is preparing to have one last tilt at securing permission to build a Scottish tennis centre just outside Dunblane. Fizzing with ideas and ventures like Miss Hits, encouraging young girls to play the game, and Tennis on the Road, which focuses on developing interest in deprived or remote areas of Scotland, Murray is also determined. \u201cMy main goal is to grow the game in Scotland. I did it before and we started with one small indoor centre with four courts and out of that we got four Davis Cup and Federation Cup players, and grand slam winners, and very good coaches. We can do the same again \u2013 starting small and growing from there. I am not desperate to produce another Andy. I couldn\u2019t do that again but hopefully I can produce a workforce that can go on to do that. I want to be up here in Scotland so I can make sure there is a legacy for what Jamie and Andy have achieved.\u201d The past and the future are so entwined in Murray\u2019s vision that, for all the pain such questions evoke, it seems important to ask her about the tragic day of 13 March 1996. It is not a subject Murray finds easy to revisit, and there are signs of distress on her face and in her voice as she talks about her raw memories. She knew Thomas Hamilton, the gunman who killed himself after taking 17 lives, and had given him occasional lifts in her car. Murray also knew most of the mothers who lost their children. While they were waiting in a school room for the police to tell them what had happened there was such little space that Murray shared a chair with a woman who had been a fellow pupil at her school when they were girls. The other woman rose from their chair when she heard it was her daughter\u2019s class which had been attacked. \u201cYou never imagine something like that would happen in your little town,\u201d Murray says softly. \u201cThat was very hard. Your immediate reaction when you realise it\u2019s not your child\u2019s class is relief and then there is enormous guilt because people you know are about to suffer. It\u2019s their child\u2019s class. You never forget that moment.\u201d Murray pauses, and shakes her head. \u201cYou never forget what you could have lost that day and it makes you appreciate what you have. It\u2019s 20 years ago and the town has recovered. No one ever forgets but the boys\u2019 success has given Dunblane a lot of pride. For me it\u2019s always a reminder of how fortunate we are and how important it is that the boys remain grounded and hard-working. It\u2019s their way of saying: \u2018This is where we are from, this is who we are \u2026\u2019\u201d They were coached initially by her and their variety of play and tactical acumen are rooted in her approach but a point came where a mother from Dunblane, without much support from the LTA, could take them no further. She had become the leading coach in Scotland but her sons needed to travel abroad. Andy was still a teenager when the first move had to be made. \u201cAs Scotland national coach my starting salary was \u00a325,000,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhen Andy had the chance to train in Spain we had to find a way. We got a little money from the LTA and Tennis Scotland but we needed \u00a335,000 a year for Andy to have a decent run at it.\u201d     Judy Murray talks with Katie Swan during her time as Great Britain\u2019s Federation Cup captain. Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images for LTA    Murray had to apply for a \u00a330,000 loan and her eyes widen. \u201cIt was a big risk. I didn\u2019t realise what we were getting into but I knew this was the next step he had to take. A year later Jamie [15 months older than Andy] finished school and wanted to go to France because they have faster surfaces. So there was huge financial stress for about three years. I can talk about it now but back then it was hard. I\u2019m not sure parents understand how horrendously expensive it is \u2013 and there are no guarantees. For most kids professional tennis just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Murray also faced the difficult task of sitting down with her eldest son in 2006 to tell him a brutal truth. \u201cI had to tell Jamie it was not going to happen for him in singles. At least I could also tell him his skills were suited to doubles.\u201d That summer, Murray dug deep into her plundered savings to entice a doubles specialist coach, Louis Cayer, to work with Jamie. \u201cI took Louis on for six weeks because it was all I could afford but he is responsible for setting Jamie in the right direction. \u201cI\u2019ve watched Jamie get better and better. He needed a settled partner in John Peers and they made two slam finals last year [before Murray switched partners and, at the Australian Open this year, won his first men\u2019s doubles grand slam with Bruno Soares]. Success helps confidence but Jamie invested in himself. You can keep plodding at 40 in the world but, in doubles, you won\u2019t make much impact. Your income is small if you\u2019re not winning the big tournaments. But Jamie paid Louis to join him on the road \u2013 not every week \u2013 because he wanted to improve. He also started working with a sports psychologist to manage his emotions better. The investment in himself has paid off.\u201d Andy, meanwhile, made yet another grand slam final in Australia, losing to Novak Djokovic, and became a father for the first time in February. He suffered a dip in form before reaching the semi-finals in Monaco, where he lost to a resurgent Rafael Nadal. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge change in his life, becoming a dad, but Andy\u2019s gone through various spells when his results have not been quite what he wanted. He started to play well again in Monte Carlo. Let\u2019s see what he can do this week in Madrid. When you have a change like fatherhood it\u2019s understandable you might get a bit distracted but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s temporary.\u201d Murray has stepped down from the Federation Cup captaincy because its unwieldy structure means that, until Britain get into the World Group, they play matches only every February. The absence of Johanna Konta and Laura Robson this year cost them the promotion place that Murray had pursued for so long. Yet she has a broader regret. \u201cI was always going to step down this year but there is a larger issue. There are not enough girls coming into tennis and I believe team competition engages fans more powerfully. I hope we can persuade the ITF to let the women have a similar format to the Davis Cup. We need to grow the women\u2019s game. At WTA events, in the early stages, the stands are empty so we need to do something to get more people watching.\u201d At least British women\u2019s tennis has a fresh presence in the impressive Konta who has risen from No150 in the world to a grand slam semi-final in Australia this year. \u201cIn the past, during the Fed Cup, she would get very anxious during the tight points but so much changed when she took on a new coach in Esteban Carril \u2013 a very calm Spanish guy. He added real calm, a big serve and taught her how to defend. She no longer panics and tries to hit herself out of trouble. Jo\u2019s on the verge of the top 20 \u2013 and she senses anything is possible.\u201d Similar belief pulses through the 56-year-old Murray. She has overcome her disappointment that plans for a Scottish tennis centre \u201cwere knocked back at local level but we have appealed to the Scottish government. I see it as the catalyst for Scottish tennis. \u201cWe need to capitalise on Jamie and Andy\u2019s success \u2013 and going back to Dunblane made me realise there\u2019s a huge appetite for tennis in Scotland. That\u2019s down to the boys but they won\u2019t play for ever and Scotland won\u2019t get another chance like this again. We have to take it. I want to secure that legacy for Scottish tennis.\u201d",
