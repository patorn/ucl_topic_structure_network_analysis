  "body": "The Chinese artist Ai Weiwei described the EU\u2019s refugee deal with Turkey as shameful and immoral as he unveiled the artistic results of his stay on the Greek island of Lesbos. Speaking in Athens, where the works are going on public display for the first time from Friday, Ai said that although he had seen and experienced extreme and violent conditions in China, he \u201ccould never have imagined conditions like this\u201d. Lesbos last year became the main European entry point for tens of thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, but arrivals have fallen dramatically since the implementation of an agreement between Brussels and Ankara to return migrants from the Greek islands to Turkey.

Photograph: \u00a9Museum of Cycladic Art    Of the agreement, Ai said: \u201cIt is not legal or moral, it is shameful and it is not a solution. It will cause problems later.\u201d  The artist told the Guardian: \u201cThese people have nothing to do with Europe; they are like people from outer space, but they have to come. They have been pushed out and they are being totally neglected by Europe. They are sleeping in the mud and rain and it is only volunteers giving them food or clothes.\u201d Ai arrived on Lesbos in December, having been invited to stage an exhibition at the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens. The island seemed like a good starting point for thinking about ancient Greece and its mythologies, philosophies and values. Instead Ai became caught up in what he said was the biggest, most shameful humanitarian crisis since the second world war.

He said he has been changed by what he has seen. \u201cIt is such a beautiful island \u2013 blue water, sunshine, tourists \u2013 and to see the boats come in with desperate children, pregnant women and elderly people, some 90 years old, and they all have fear and they all have it in their eyes \u2026 You think: how could this happen? I got completely emotionally involved.\u201d Ai said Europe needed to understand that the refugees were fleeing their countries because they had to. It was leave or die, he said. The exhibition at the MCA, Ai\u2019s first in Greece, includes an enormous collage of 12,030 small pictures taken on his camera phone, documenting his time on the island.

Photograph: \u00a9Museum of Cycladic Art    He is also exhibiting photographs taken by six Greek amateur photographers, in partnership with the Photographic Society of Mytilene. One work juxtaposes an ancient Greek vessel that was used to collect tears from mourners with the teargas cannisters used on refugees in the Idomeni camp in Macedonia. One represented beauty and poetry, he said, the other cruelty and barbarism. Elsewhere in the show is a model of a lifebuoy rendered in fine marble, similar to the marble versions he has previously made of the surveillance cameras that constantly watched him in China. Ai is one of the best-known artists in the world, with a fame partly acquired for the wrong reasons after he was detained for 81 days in 2011 during a crackdown on political activists.   Related: Ai Weiwei poses as drowned Syrian infant refugee in 'haunting' photo    He currently has a studio in Berlin but his focus this year has been on Lesbos and the refugee crisis, making a feature length documentary which he plans for cinema release. \u201cI want it to be a historic account of the tragedy which years, decades, later people will watch and see how we behaved in this moment.\u201d He now has over 600 hours of footage, he said. \u201cLast week I said OK, 80% of it is done, this week I\u2019m saying 75% because things are developing so fast.\u201d In the meantime he hopes the exhibition and his constant posting on Twitter and Instagram will raise awareness of the refugee crisis. The only solution is humanity, he said. \u201cPeople are being selfish, very greedy, short-sighted and ridiculous. This is not a regional problem; it is a human problem. The bad guys are everywhere, but also the good guys are. We have to trust in humanity but not trust in politicians.\u201d \u2022 Ai Weiwei at Cycladic, the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens, 20 May-30 October",
