  "body": "The Grunts in Trouble by Philip Aardagh Review by Scarlet This book is about a family of ugly people who stole a boy from a washing line! They live in a caravan that Mr Grunt made with his father. They are always moving because if they stayed in one place they would cause trouble.       I think girls aged about 10 would enjoy this book. It\u2019s really funny and not too long! I give it five out of five stars. My favourite bit was when the fireworks are set off by Larry Smalls. Attack of the Demon Dinner Ladies by Pamela Butchart Review by Emily  This book is about some children who try to stop the new \u2018demon\u2019 dinner ladies at their school. The children get into lots of mischief along the way before they realise they are wrong.      I personally think that all ages would love this book. I did, but it is probably focused on younger ages. I loved it because it was very funny and entertaining. It almost turns the pages for you as you can\u2019t put it down. I give it four stars out of five. My absolutely favourite bit was when Maddie was in with the basketballs. I read this book in one evening!  Witchworld by Emma Fischel Review by Lexie Witchworld is about Flo who lives with her mum and her sister. Her sister Hetty thinks her nose isn\u2019t warty or pointy enough. Her mum runs a magazine called Hocus Pocus which is full of gossip and scandal about famous witches. Flo\u2019s grandma comes to stay and tells everyone that the ghouls are going to attack and no one believes her.      Witchworld    I think people who loved Goth Girl would love this book as Chris Riddell does the pictures. I really liked it as it was really fun. I\u2019m reading the next one now. I give it 4.5/5.
