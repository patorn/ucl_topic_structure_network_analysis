  "body": "It is a strangely touching image of vulnerability. Nothing speaks more of the weakness of the human body than the aids with which we try to remedy its failings. This is why in placing a pair of spectacles on an art gallery floor \u2013 just centimetres from the blankness of a white wall and facing outward as if looking at the feet of gallery-goers, beckoning them to kneel, crouch, and interact, or at least take a photo - the artistic duo Kevin Nguyen and TJ Khayatan have created a modern masterpiece.   Related: Pair of glasses left on US gallery floor mistaken for art    If you haven\u2019t heard of Nguyen and Khayatan that\u2019s not because they are on this year\u2019s Turner prize shortlist. It is simply because until now their interventions in public spaces have been so elusive they were ignored by the mainstream media. A glob of chewing gum slowly drying under a bus seat. A piece of paper crumpled into a ball and thrown in a wastepaper basket. A series of footprints in the snow that lead hauntingly from one place to another. Work No 13,561: A Pair of Glasses on the Floor goes beyond these daring gestures in actually being placed in an art gallery so everybody can see it must be art. This is what genius looks like now. We live at a moment when the difference between art and not-art is so small and subtle that where you put something can change it from stuff to concept, thing to idea, a \u00a320 pair of glasses to a million-dollar artistic masterpiece. On your face or mine these would just be glasses. Or would they? By showing that what looks like a pair of specs can in reality be art, Nguyen and Khayatan make us aware that life and art are not so different. It is a new way of seeing the world itself \u2013 literally, through a pair of glasses.    This is the readymade at its most casual and profound    When I look through, or at, those glasses, I can\u2019t help thinking of Jasper Johns\u2019 sculpture The Critic Sees. In 1964, Johns made a metal relief of a pair of spectacles behind which we see not eyes, but glibly talking mouths. The critic sees with her or his mouth: whereof we cannot speak we must remain silent, according to Wittgenstein, unless we are critics. Nguyen and Khayatan are much better artists than Johns. Where he laboriously \u201cmade\u201d a pair of glasses, like some obsessive medieval craftsman, they have made the true Duchampian leap into instant simplicity. These glasses are just glasses, no different from any other pair. What turns them into art, then? Being put on the floor? No, it cannot be that, for many works of art exist that are not on the floor. The Sistine Chapel ceiling, for instance \u2013 although compared with this utterly unpretentious gesture Michelangelo\u2019s years of being spattered with paint up on his scaffolding do seem somewhat wasted. The truth is that nothing makes this everyday object into art except our decision to call it such. This act of random transformation is impossible to explain; you just have to feel it. I get the same almost mystical sense of metamorphosis from these glasses as I do from Tracey Emin\u2019s bed or Duchamp\u2019s urinal. This is the readymade at its most casual and profound. Perhaps it all goes back to Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s painting of A Cup of Water and a Rose, painted in about 1630. For Zurbar\u00e1n the white purity of a cup is a spiritual metaphor. A Pair of Glasses on the Floor has that same purity and transparency (the transparency of the lenses, set off by the blackness of the frame). Admittedly Zurbar\u00e1n carefully painted his cup with all the skill he learned in a Seville painting workshop and Nguyen and Khayatan just put a pair of glasses on the floor. But that\u2019s where 400 years of artistic development have brought us. This might say it all if they had simply put a cup on the floor. They didn\u2019t do that. Why? Because they chose to put a pair of glasses on the floor instead. A pair of glasses \u2013 spectacles, goggles, four eyes, the vocabulary does not matter \u2013 is unavoidably connected with looking. With seeing. And it gets more intimate than that. For this is also a piece of performance art. Kevin Nguyen and TJ Khayatan just seemed like ordinary teenage visitors at San Francisco\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. Then in the terse words of the official account \u201cKhayatan put Nguyen\u2019s glasses on the floor\u201d. Nguyen shared his own human weakness with us in this audacious performance. He needed those glasses to see. In an act of artistic self-sacrifice comparable to Van Gogh cutting off his own ear, he gave his vision to us. Now he can\u2019t even read this. I can barely read it myself through the tears when I think of the enormity of this artistic masterpiece. For this is the ultimate work of art. By that I mean the terminal one. It is the necessary end of an artistic evolution that started 30,000 years ago when ice-age artists painted animals in Chauvet cave. They had no spectacles, of course. That is why the horses they painted in Chauvet are all blurred together. Ever since, art has been about seeing, failing to see, then gradually seeing better. Until now. See this, say these teenaged geniuses. Go on, look closer. Closer still. Made you look! We see and laugh along.",
