  "body": "Tony Bellew recovered from a first-round knockdown to win the WBC world cruiserweight title with a third-round stoppage of Ilunga Makabu.   Related: Ricky Burns makes history after stopping Michele di Rocco    The Everton supporter \u2013 in front of his own fans at Goodison Park \u2013 was floored by the Congolese fighter in round one but came back with a flurry of punches in the third which pinned his opponent against the ropes. A combination of left hooks, followed by a damaging right left Makabu out cold on his feet, to the delight of the Goodison faithful. After the knockout the 33-year-old went over to Makabu\u2019s corner and said: \u201cI respect you so much. We can\u2019t be friends before but I respect you so much.\u201d Bellew then told Sky Sports: \u201cI got knocked down but that\u2019s what I do. I told you I am Everton. That\u2019s why I got up. Nothing was going to stop me tonight. I cried in the dressing room two hours ago when I got here. I achieved the dream tonight, I am world champion, that\u2019s what I am. \u201cI believe in my coach and these people around me. My dad, my missus, my sons, I do it all for them. So much credit to a lot of people. I am the best cruiserweight in the world.\u201d",
