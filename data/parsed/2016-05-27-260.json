  "body": "The UN World Food Programme is offering electronic vouchers instead of food aid to some displaced people in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region but, despite the success of vouchers elsewhere in Sudan, some Darfuri recipients claim the scheme leaves them worse off because high inflation keeps food prices rising. The initiative aims to help nearly 450,000 people in Darfur, about a quarter of the 1.8 million displaced people in the region. Some of the displaced not included in the voucher scheme will continue to receive food assistance. \u201cWe have a plan to reach all the displaced people in Darfur one day, depending on the security situation. We also need to have viable markets,\u201d said Amor Almagro, the WFP spokeswoman in Sudan.   Related: The forgotten mountains: a journey into the heart of rebel-held Darfur \u2013 in pictures    More than 2.5 million people have been displaced and 400,000 killed in Darfur, according to the UN, since an insurgency against the government in 2003 and subsequent crackdown by Khartoum.  The WFP has been registering displaced people in Otash camp, South Darfur, with a view to replacing the paper vouchers they have been using since 2013 with smart cards. The move follows a successful initiative at Derage camp in the same state. E-vouchers at Otash should be ready to use by July. \u201cThe registration has been going smoothly for Otash camp and we expect will be finished by the middle of June,\u201d said Bille Khalaf, the programme policy officer for cash-based transfers at the WFP. However, with inflation pushing up food prices on a daily basis in Sudan, many people in South Darfur camps are not optimistic about the new scheme. \u201cThe prices are really high and they only give us around $7 [\u00a34.77] a month for a person,\u201d said Hwaaa Hassa, 49, who is raising 11 children and grandchildren at Otash. She added: \u201cIt was far better for us when they used to give us direct food. It used to be a lot and we had the chance of exchanging it with other items at the markets in Nyala but the new project doesn\u2019t give us this option.\u201d Another woman also expressed concerns. \u201cI prefer the old way of distributing food at the camps, and they used to give us more food than now,\u201d said 40-year-old Hawaa Yacoub, a mother of nine who has been living in Derage camp since 2004. Eligible Darfuri families are given cards topped up monthly with about 52 Sudanese pounds (\u00a36; $8.50). Recipients are able to buy food from designated shops participating in the programme.     Ahmed Mohamdeen, 58, at Nyala\u2019s main market. He has three wives and 12 children, all living at Otash camp. He said: \u2018The new system did not help me at all, I have lots of children and the stuff is really expensive here.\u2019 Photograph: Gabriela Vivacqua/WFP    The number of items redeemable has been increased to 18, including lentils, oil, onions, dry okra, tomatoes, garlic, salt, sugar, flour, pasta, sorghum, millet, eggs and goat meat. \u201cThey now have many choices; they take whatever they want from the shops at the camps. They used to only take certain items and sometimes [had] to go outside the camp to exchange it with other items. We are actually boosting the Sudanese economy,\u201d said Khalaf. One NGO worker from Nyala in South Darfur, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \u201cThe project makes the IDPs [displaced people] safer because they don\u2019t need to go out of the camps to collect food, which may put them at a risk of being targeted by Janjaweed [Arab militias].\u201d He said the scheme prevents cheating by people who were able to take food aid using fake names. The cash vouchers scheme is partly funded by the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID), which has contributed \u00a350.6m to WFP\u2019s Sudanese vouchers programme since 2013.

However, the WFP provided solar [panels] that help the shop owners to charge their devices.\u201d The scheme has had an unwelcome impact for some Darfur residents living outside the camps. \u201cBecause of this project, many people are struggling to get their basic needs at Nyala markets, because most of the shop owners are now buying all the items from Nyala markets and sell[ing] them in the camps,\u201d said Nazar Makki, the programme officer of Afaq al Salam, a monitoring NGO based in Nyala.
