The clamour for changes to the UK\u2019s child protection law has been growing since the Jimmy Savile scandal, which exposed how the DJ abused hundreds of young victims at institutions across the country. It emerged that, despite the fact that many people had concerns about Savile\u2019s behaviour, very few raised them with the authorities. In response, the government will shortly announce a 12-week consultation on the mandatory reporting of abuse \u2013 in what is being described by supporters as the biggest and most important debate around child protection measures for decades. The consultation is the result of lobbying from Mandate Now, the largest coalition of survivor charities in the UK, which has been pushing for a law requiring staff who work in regulated activities to report concerns about the welfare of children and vulnerable adults to their local authority. The coalition\u2019s founder, Tom Perry, who was the first complainant in the Caldicott School child abuse scandal, said that mandatory reporting of suspected or known child abuse was a \u201cvital component\u201d of a functioning child protection system and has the potential to positively impact the lives of millions. Perry explained that currently there is no obligation on anyone working in a regulated activity to report the fact that they had witnessed abuse. This is in stark contrast to many countries, where this is obligatory. Mandate Now claims that more than four-fifths of five developed nations have some form of mandatory reporting. However, the government has been dithering over when to introduce the consultation because of concerns about feasibility. Mandate Now highlights research by Professor Ben Mathews, an Australian respected child protection expert who has completed a 10-year study of mandatory reporting. Mathews compared two demographically similar locations with similar-sized child populations. He found that in 2010 in the Australian state of Victoria, which has mandatory reporting, almost five times as many sexually abused children were identified as in Ireland, which does not. But the UK\u2019s Lucy Faithfull Foundation, which works with sex offenders and abuse victims, said it was not convinced that mandatory reporting would prove effective. \u201cWe need to tackle today\u2019s issues with knowledge of what is going on today, not base present-day responses on inadequacies or scandals from the past,\u201d said director of research Donald Findlater. \u201cThose who argue for mandatory reporting seem to assume that most known or suspected abuse is not reported. I don\u2019t believe that is the case, though there are exceptions.\u201d Findlater pointed out that there are already sanctions that could be invoked against those who failed to take action. \u201cWhere there is knowledge or suspicion of abuse, I believe this is mostly passed on to the authorities. And where it is not, employers can take disciplinary action, professional associations can withdraw registration and the Disclosure and Barring Service can ban someone from working with children.\u201d He said that evidence from countries where mandatory reporting had been introduced showed that it increased the number of reports submitted to the authorities. \u201cOur criminal justice system is already overwhelmed by the volume of work, with sexual abuse cases dominating many court timetables. I want to see expensive and valuable police and court time taken up with prosecuting sex offenders, not being distracted by attending to those who fail to report.\u201d Supporters of mandatory reporting complain that what they are calling for is being misrepresented by critics. They claim that it would promote a culture of prevention by obliging \u2013 and protecting \u2013 designated people such as teachers, doctors, nurses and clergy to report their concerns, based on a child\u2019s disclosures or if they had reasonable grounds for suspicion. They highlight the example of Australia, where mandated reports of child sexual abuse make up only about 6% of reports of all forms of child maltreatment made to the government. Peter Wanless, head of the NSPCC, said the charity was preparing to engage with the consultation. \u201cReporting child abuse is the first step to protecting children and helping them to recover,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s vital that professionals are supported in speaking out and that allegations of abuse are properly investigated. But failing to act to protect children where abuse is known, or covering up abuse in closed institutions such as hospitals, schools or care homes, should be a criminal offence.\u201d But Perry was dismissive of the NSPCC\u2019s position. He said the law needed to go further so that professionals would be compelled to report concerns if they had reasonable grounds or face criminal sanctions. \u201cEffective child protection is not about failing to act \u2013 it is about being required to act.\u201d",
