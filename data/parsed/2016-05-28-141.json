  "body": "Related: The Nice Guys review: Crowe and Gosling are abysmal PIs in a high hit-rate action comedy    A lot of people liked Shane Black\u2019s 2005 directorial debut, the self-referential neo-noir romp Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, but Russell Crowe wasn\u2019t one of them. \u201cI think it\u2019s too aware of itself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s an in-joke going on in that movie, and I don\u2019t connect to that. It\u2019s not funny for me if the guy thinks he\u2019s being funny.\u201d Luckily for Crowe, Black\u2019s new comedy drops the meta shtick in favour of outright ineptitude. In The Nice Guys, Crowe and Ryan Gosling are a pair of schmucks bungling their way through a private eye case in 1977 Los Angeles. It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t know they\u2019re being funny, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing at all. In one early scene, Gosling\u2019s booze-soaked sleuth Holland March messes up a bar break-in so badly he ends up in an ambulance, while Jackson Healy, Crowe\u2019s burly enforcer, is more interested in beating up small-time creeps than following any lead they might give up. The film works because Black\u2019s dialogue is sharper than broken glass, but there\u2019s plenty of the latter, too; he can barely look at a window without wanting to send a character flying through it. It\u2019s an old-fashioned Raymond Chandler crime caper repainted with 70s sleaze. Eleven years on from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys is something of a comeback for Black. For a time, he was the king of the high-octane buddy-movie and his voice permeated through an entire era of Hollywood action. The first script he sold, at the age of 23, was for Lethal Weapon. After working on the sequel, the next script he pitched to producer Joel Silver \u2013 with whom he\u2019s worked on and off ever since \u2013 was called Die Hard.             Related: Lethal weapons: Shane Black's pulp fiction is still the best action around    \u201cAt the time, he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was going to finish it, and I was doing another movie based on a book called Nothing Lasts Forever,\u201d recalls Silver. \u201cI said: \u2018Can I use that title?\u2019 and he said: \u2018Of course you can.\u2019 So that was where Die Hard came from.\u201d Black\u2019s own Die Hard was eventually made as The Last Boy Scout in 1991; then came Last Action Hero in 1993, before he sold the screenplay for 1996\u2019s The Long Kiss Goodnight for a then-record $4m. Burnt out by his own success, it would be nine years before he made another film. When he returned, as writer-director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, he won over just about everyone (except Crowe). The film resurrected both his own career and Robert Downey Jr\u2019s reputation, and Downey Jr repaid the favour by getting him in to write and direct Iron Man 3. It went on to become the 10th highest-grossing film of all time. \u201cAfter Iron Man 3, I could probably have parlayed that into something else that was more superheroic,\u201d says Black. \u201cBut I thought: you know what, Joel Silver and The Nice Guys is just sitting there, and that\u2019s the well I wanted to return to.\u201d     Photograph: Allstar     Related: Ryan Gosling: 'If I had to shake it like a showgirl, I was going to do it'    The freewheeling plot of The Nice Guys sees March and Healy teaming up to investigate a string of deaths of people involved in making a porn film. That eventually leads them to stumble across a conspiracy at the heart of the American auto industry. Black wrote the script with his writing partner Anthony Bagarozzi back in 2001 during his wilderness years. \u201cWe wrote this a long time ago and we just wanted to do a detective movie because we didn\u2019t feel there were enough of \u2019em\u201d, he says. \u201cWas it returning to the signature? The mojo? No, I just like it.\u201d Originally, the film was set in the present day but Black soon saw advantages in moving back in time. \u201cA displacement from the current day adds a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst off, in suspense movies you lose cell phones, which is always great because when someone is in trouble they have to run and find a fucking phone. But secondly, it adds an element of myth. You take this latter-day Sodom and Gomorrah that LA had become and these tarnished angels and then you let them loose. Chinatown did it for the 30s, so we looked at the 70s and found this horrible combination of smog and porn, which had sort of assailed the city.\u201d     Photograph: Allstar     Related: Russell Crowe on acting: 'Seriously, it's not that complicated'    The shift of perspective also gives Black the opportunity to ask questions about masculinity. Healy believes in solving problems with his fists, but only because he knows no other way. He concludes a story about beating up a man threatening a diner by confessing, \u201cIt was the best day of my life, because I felt useful.\u201d Gosling\u2019s March, meanwhile, is a single father, trying to be a good dad, just with heavy drinking and gun fighting thrown in. There\u2019s a great running gag about him correcting his 13-year-old daughter Holly\u2019s poor phrasing. \u201cIt\u2019s his lame attempt,\u201d laughs Black. \u201cHe\u2019s being the worst dad possible but he has this one little trope that he comes back to. He\u2019s like the husband who fixes a doorknob and then for six months every time the wife says something: \u2018Hey, I fixed that doorknob!\u2019 It\u2019s him going: \u2018Hey, I tell her to speak properly,\u2019 but he does everything else wrong.\u201d Black\u2019s scripts have drawn criticism for depicting testosterone-fogged worlds where men are men and women are either porn stars or strippers, (such as Halle Berry in The Last Boy Scout). He defends The Nice Guys on the grounds that the smartest person onscreen is the precocious, quick-witted Holly, played by Angourie Rice, who, like many a child sidekick before her, outthinks her dad at every turn.     Photograph: Allstar    \u201cShe\u2019s the best of the group in terms of being a detective,\u201d Black points out. \u201cEven on set we used to joke that she\u2019s the mature one. Those two schmucks would be arguing and laughing all the time, while she\u2019d just be on her mark ready to go.\u201d Black dismisses the idea that as a screenwriter he should consider things like the Bechdel test when writing female characters. \u201cIt would be silly of me to rely on anything other than my own intuitions when coming up with characters, because addressing people\u2019s expectations is one way, I think, to fail them consistently,\u201d he says. \u201cI just think you write organically, but I love women characters. To do a movie with two women would be one of my goals.\u201d You could say the study in masculinity continues off screen, too. Black has something of a reputation as a difficult character, as does Crowe and even Gosling, who was reportedly fired from The Lovely Bones by Peter Jackson for being too demanding and recalcitrant.      Shane Black at the Cannes film festival, May 2016. Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty    Over tea and cigarettes, Crowe argues that a shared willingness to fight for their characters brought out the best in each other. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, right, because Joel\u2019s got a reputation. Shane has a reputation. Ryan has a reputation. I have a reputation. But put those four guys on a set together and it\u2019s like a fucking Beatles reunion. There\u2019s melody everywhere, man. It makes you question who defines this word \u2018difficult\u2019, and applies it to people who only want to do their best?\u201d Any plans of writing a film for two female leads will have to wait for a moment; Black\u2019s next job is the upcoming reboot of Predator. The 1987 original is a film he saw from the inside after Silver gave him the part of Hawkins, radio operator and teller of filthy jokes. His take won\u2019t, of course, be a buddy comedy \u2013 although it won\u2019t be entirely removed. \u201cIt will have elements of this,\u201d says Black. \u201cTone-shifting, so the movie is not just one tone throughout, is kind of what keeps it alive and fun. You\u2019re making it a stew so it\u2019s not just one thing.\u201d With Shane Black, it never is. The Nice Guys is in cinemas from Friday 3 June",
