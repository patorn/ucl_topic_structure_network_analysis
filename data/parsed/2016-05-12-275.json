  "body": "After months of legal delay and more than a year since Freddie Gray\u2019s death, Edward Nero will be the second officer to stand trial over Gray\u2019s death on Thursday. An unprecedented legal strategy may turn Nero\u2019s case into a referendum on police stops in high-crime areas and have wide-ranging implications on how officers can be punished for illegal stops, searches and detentions.   Related: Baltimore timeline: the year since Freddie Gray's arrest    Gray died of spinal injuries sustained while he was in the back of a police van, shackled and without a seatbelt. Nero is charged with assault, reckless endangerment, and misconduct in office, all misdemeanor charges. But Nero\u2019s charges don\u2019t have any direct relationship to Gray\u2019s death. In fact, prosecutors will not be permitted to mention \u201cthe extent of Gray\u2019s injuries\u201d during the trial, according to a ruling by the judge. Instead, prosecutors argue, not only was Gray\u2019s arrest illegal, but that any physical contact that Nero had with Gray constituted assault. University of Maryland law professor Douglas Colbert called prosecutors\u2019 argument a \u201cbold move\u201d. It is not uncommon for judges to throw out evidence obtained by an illegal search or stop, but rarely if ever do officers face criminal charges for their improper real-time judgments about whether there was sufficient cause to make a stop or an arrest. Nero\u2019s lawyers have subpoenaed numerous members of Marilyn Mosby\u2019s state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to show how rare it is.

Nero\u2019s lawyers warn that a ruling to criminally prosecute an officer over such an arrest could have drastic repercussions for policing. They argue that \u201cofficers would simply not make arrests\u201d if there was a risk that they could be subject to criminal prosecution any time it was later determined that they did not have probable cause for the arrest. Baltimore\u2019s Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, the police union which is paying for the officer\u2019s defense, argued last year that the spike in crime after Gray\u2019s death resulted from officers\u2019 fears that they would be prosecuted in such a way. Many Baltimore residents, by contrast, see the chase and detention of Gray as central to their outrage in the weeks after Gray\u2019s death. \u201cWhat they\u2019re basing it off of is the area we\u2019re living in because we live in the projects,\u201d said a woman named Latonya on 25 April 2015, hours before protests at Camden Yards got out of control. \u201cWe\u2019re in this community, so that\u2019s how they pick us out, but that\u2019s not right \u2026 You cannot consider in Sandtown-Winchester \u2026 that every single block is a high-crime area.\u201d And Colbert says a ruling for criminal punishment for such arrests may be a necessary corrective. \u201cCurrently the police power to arrest on presumed probable cause has resulted in roughly 60-65% of arrests being dismissed or not prosecuted. To me that indicates that many of the people originally arrested should not have been charged or taken into custody,\u201d he said. Gray\u2019s case started on the morning of 12 April 2015. Nero was on bike patrol with fellow officers. When they made eye contact with Gray at the corner of North Avenue and Mount, Gray began to run.   Related: Freddie Gray, one year later: Baltimore's black residents still waiting for changes    Nero and another officer Garrett Miller, both white, pursued Gray through the Gilmor Homes housing project, where they eventually caught up with Gray, handcuffed him, dragged him across the ground, and held him face down, while twisting up his legs as he cried for help. The officers found what they thought was an illegal switchblade. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office subsequently said that the knife was, in fact, legal and charged Nero and Miller with false imprisonment. The false imprisonment charges were later dropped but prosecutors still base their charges on the theory that there was no legal ground for the arrest, and therefore any contact with Gray was assaultive. Others who say there was a legal ground for arrest cite the 2000 supreme court case Illinois v Wardlow, which allows a combination of factors, such as flight and a high-crime area, to justify stops.  \u201cIt was clearly a legal chase, stop, frisk, then search. And a reasonable arrest, even if it wasn\u2019t legal (and it might have been legal),\u201d said Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore police officer and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a weaker case.\u201d  Nero is also charged with reckless endangerment for failing to fasten Gray\u2019s seatbelt, which, according to the prosecution, created a situation that ultimately may have led to Gray\u2019s injury and death. Williams, however, will not allow the prosecution to bring witnesses to discuss the extent of Gray\u2019s injuries.  The case against the first of six officers, William Porter, ended in a mistrial in December when the jury could not come back with a unanimous verdict. Legal wrangling since then has centered on whether Porter can be required to testify in the other trials while still awaiting his own retrial. Maryland\u2019s highest court has ruled that Porter could be forced to testify against Nero and the other officers, allowing the trials to resume. Prosecutors followed up on this victory by moving to require Miller, whose own trial is scheduled for July, to testify against Nero. Nero has requested a bench trial, without a jury, so proceedings will most definitely provide the first verdict in the case and influence strategy in subsequent cases. During pre-trial motions, Judge Williams said he expected that both sides should have finished presenting their cases next week. Neither the state nor any of the defense attorneys are at liberty to comment as a result of the gag order Williams has imposed.",
