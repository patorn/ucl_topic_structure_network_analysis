  "body": "Five years ago, Thomas Cohen fronted the motorik post-punk band SCUM. Critics raved about them, but they got no further than playing dingy rooms to handfuls of people. More attention arrived after the singer\u2019s marriage to Peaches Geldof in 2012. For the last two years, the spotlight has fallen on Cohen for more unwanted reasons, after he found Peaches \u2013 the mother of his two children \u2013 dead in their home from a heroin overdose, aged 25. Nobody would wish that kind of grief on anyone, never mind someone so young, but Cohen\u2019s not without an impish sense of humour as he tries to rebuild his life and career. The crowds are still not massing to his live shows, but when a snatch of canned applause comes through the PA system he feigns raising his arms, as if he\u2019s a champion boxer. \u201cI know I sound like a bit of toff,\u201d he says. (He doesn\u2019t.) \u201cI\u2019m actually from sarf London.\u201d   Related: Thomas Cohen on life after Peaches: \u2018I had to face the pain\u2019    Perhaps this is his way of putting a brave face on things, and with his satin jacket, embroidered trousers and early Keith Richards-meets-Ziggy Stardust hairstyle, he looks every inch the rising rock star. There are moments, however, when the barefoot singer-guitarist sits quietly and looks momentarily lost, either in a memory or the hazy, dreamlike reverie invited by his songs. Cohen\u2019s debut album, Bloom Forever \u2013 the middle names of his youngest son \u2013 is a fragile, sad, beautiful thing. Songs written before and after Peaches\u2019 passing are warm and woozy, but with an underlying melancholy. The gig is the same. At times, it\u2019s hard to know if the ethereal atmosphere is down to the meagre audience or the poignancy in the music.  He introduces the harrowing Country Home as \u201ca song about country life\u201d, which is one way of describing a tune that addresses grief \u2013 and the moment he found Peaches dead \u2013 with cathartic but uncomfortable candour. \u201cEverybody knows \u2026 That house feels so cold,\u201d he sings, his troubled drawl reminiscent of the great Only Ones frontman Peter Perrett. Cohen\u2019s mouth smashes into the microphone as he cries: \u201cDid you know all along that you couldn\u2019t make it through?\u201d      It\u2019s not all dark, though, and sunnier songs such as the bouncing, piano-bashing New Morning Comes grasp the hope of new beginnings. There\u2019s rampaging, Patti Smith-style rock, and even a grin or two as Cohen trades coruscating rock guitar solos with Rhys Timson (moonlighting from support band Blueprint Boy), who apparently learned the entire setlist in four days. Eventually, Cohen\u2019s shows will emerge from the shadows and benefit from the electricity of bigger audiences. But when the closer, Mother Mary, finds him sweetly singing, \u201cI will hold on to the part of me that is in love with you / And go back into myself,\u201d it\u2019s a manifesto for a brave and sensitive emerging songwriter who deserves to be known for his music, not who he was married to. \u2022 At Chats Palace, London, 16 May. Then touring until 22 May.",
