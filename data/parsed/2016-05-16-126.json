The lines come from WB Yeats\u2019s Easter 1916, an elusive depiction of the Irish rebellion against British rule that in six days left 485 people dead, paved the way for independence and sent shockwaves through the British empire (as well as making the front page of the New York Times for 14 consecutive days). The Easter Rising\u2019s centenary has been marked in Dublin and London and is now the cue for a festival of Irish arts and culture at the Kennedy Center in Washington. US vice-president Joe Biden, who, like Clinton, is an ardent champion of Yeats, and Irish taoiseach Enda Kenny are expected to attend the opening performance on Tuesday night. The three-week programme of dance, literature, music and theatre seems likely to strike a chord in a nation with more than 34m Irish Americans. Kenny will doubtless be hoping that culture \u2013 an area in which Ireland has always punched way above its weight \u2013 can demonstrate the utility of soft power. Irish actor and director Fiona Shaw is the festival\u2019s artist-in-residence, and she will direct the opening performance, present the US premiere of one of her works and lead panel discussions and a master class. It is a fair bet that Yeats\u2019s Easter 1916 will crop up at least once, along with questions over the origins, timing and haphazard organisation of the rising, which ended with the execution of 15 ringleaders.

Yeats was incredibly ambivalent about it and the poem is marvellous. It\u2019s like a paean or a hymn to these guys but it holds the ambivalence very well. \u2018A terrible beauty\u2019 is a very good phrase: it is terrible and it is beautiful.\u201d Shaw has performed in America often, including Medea and Samuel Beckett\u2019s Happy Days in Washington. She is struck by a cultural affinity between the two countries. \u201cThe Irish do very well when they go abroad, often better than when they stay at home,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cAnd America is a great place to do well in.\u201d Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night, by Eugene O\u2019Neill, an Irish immigrant\u2019s son, is once again playing on Broadway, and Beckett is especially popular here. \u201cThe Americans are much better at dark jokes than you might think. If you have a joke about killing or dying, they get absolutely hysterical. It\u2019s a much more violent, much more immediate response to really scary things.  \u201cI felt they were definitely the best audience for Beckett. They\u2019re very quick and they are still a theatregoing nation. They still see the point of getting out and being together and watching a person breathe in the same room as you as opposed to going to movie.\u201d It is fitting that the festival should be held at an arts complex named after John Fitzgerald Kennedy, America\u2019s first Irish Catholic president, whose own centenary falls next year and will be honoured with plays and screenings during the Irish season. Shaw said she had been reading about the early kings of Ireland. \u201cAnd then there was an ard r\u00ed which means the high king. But really Kennedy, was our high king who lived in a far off land. He was a unifying symbol, quite amazing.\u201d In June 1963, Kennedy became the first foreign head of state to honour the leaders of the Easter rising at their burial site at Arbour Hill. He told the Irish parliament: \u201cNo people ever believed more deeply in the cause of Irish freedom than the people of the United States.\u201d     \u2018Kennedy was our high king who lived in a far off land.\u2019 Photograph: John Rous/AP    Anne Anderson, the Irish ambassador to the US, said: \u201cThe visit was extraordinary at the time: an Irish American Catholic president. You have to set it against the backdrop of both the real experience and the received wisdom, \u2018no Catholics need apply\u2019 and the Wasp elite that ran parts of America. So it was huge. Ireland was a more religious country then than it is now. For a time, you would have a picture of the Sacred Heart and a picture of JFK in parlours in Ireland, particularly in rural Ireland.\u201d Kennedy promised that he would return in the spring of the following year but was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, in November. The news was \u201cengraved on the heart\u201d of many Irish people, added Anderson, who was a girl in north County Dublin at the time. \u201cNobody in Ireland had televisions at that stage, and a neighbour who\u2019d heard it on the radio went around the neighbourhood knocking on everybody\u2019s door to tell us, \u2018Did you hear the news? JFK has died.\u2019\u201d A giant bust of him now watches audiences come and go at the Kennedy Center, which starting this week will host more than 50 performances and 500 performers. They include dancers Colin Dunne and Jean Butler, previously seen in Riverdance, and opera singers Tara Erraught and Anthony Kearns. The Abbey Theatre will perform Sean O\u2019Casey\u2019s Easter Rising drama The Plough and the Stars. Installations include The Earth Harp, billed as the world\u2019s biggest stringed instrument, and A Girl\u2019s Bedroom, from writer-director Enda Walsh, a free 20-minute immersive experience. The centre\u2019s north plaza will become a \u201cgreen space\u201d for fiddlers, pipers and step dancers, as well as food trucks serving bangers and mash, fish and chips and Guinness. Such events are an underrated tool of diplomacy in Washington, where the British embassy has milked Downton Abbey at every opportunity. The Irish embassy must be one of the few buildings anywhere to contain both a statue of Abraham Lincoln and a bust of Oscar Wilde. \u201cIt\u2019s immensely important,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cFor a country of our size, the fact we have won four Nobel prizes in literature, for example: other countries have won more, but no country of our size has won as many. Culture \u2013 for any country, it\u2019s your calling card, but particularly for a country with the extraordinary wealth of literary, theatrical, dance, musical richness that Ireland has. It is our way of introducing ourselves across the United States.\u201d     The opening night of Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night, starring Michael Shannon, Jessica Lange and John Gallagher Jr. Photograph: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images    Such calling cards may be all the more important in the future because Irish immigration to the US has waned since the 19th century boom and the demographics of the country are shifting. \u201cIt means that inevitably, Irish America is shrinking as a proportion of the population here,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt also means that the connection is growing more distant in the sense that by definition it\u2019s going to be now more third and fourth generation rather than first and second generation. \u201cSo if you recognise that, as we do, then you have to work even harder at maintaining the connections, making sure that they won\u2019t grow more distant generationally. Reaching young people, and culture, is so important in all of that.\u201d The 100-year-old rebellion in Britain\u2019s oldest colony, in particular, is fading into the remote past. Alicia Adams, curator of the Ireland 100 festival, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Americans have any knowledge of the Easter rising. I think what most people remember, if they were born by the time Clinton was president, is the negotiations that George Mitchell held between the north and the south and finally the end to the Troubles that were in Ireland and also the UK, all the bombings that were happening with the IRA.\u201d Those events prompted Clinton to turn to more of his favourite lines, again the work of an Irish poet. Speaking in Londonderry in 1995, the president quoted Seamus Heaney:  History says, Don\u2019t hope On this side of the grave, But then, once in a lifetime The longed-for tidal wave Of justice can rise up, And hope and history rhyme.
