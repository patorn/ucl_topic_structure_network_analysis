  "body": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is joining  Biggleswade  Manchester United, then he\u2019s going to rub salt in Chelsea\u2019s eye by signing Willian. Sneaky Jos\u00e9!  Unfortunately for United, though, Chelsea have swooped ahead of them in the race for Everton\u2019s \u00a365m Romelu Lukaku. Is there no end to their suffering! Why, it\u2019s been six days since they won a trophy, for crying out loud. The Football Association really should do something about that.  Still, in happier news, it seems that plucky little United are edging closer to handing YouTube sensation Zlatan Ibrahimovic a \u00a3220,000 a week contract to refer to himself in the first person. And they\u2019re also going to offer Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u00a354m for Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez.  Fashion\u2019s Dani Alves is about to join Juventus on a free transfer. Barcelona will replace him with Arsenal\u2019s H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn. Not to worry, though, Carl Jenkinson is nearing a return to full fitness.  Abject \u00a347m disappointment Raheem Sterling fears that he won\u2019t have much of a future at Manchester City under Pep Guardiola. Brendan\u2019s ready and waiting at Celtic, Raheem.    Related: Liverpool turn focus to Southampton\u2019s Sadio Man\u00e9 after Mario G\u00f6tze failure    Marseille\u2019s Michy Batshuayi is fluttering his eyelashes at various Premier League clubs, with Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United leading the chase for the Belgian hotshot. You can\u2019t have too many Belgians, unless you\u2019re Belgium manager Marc Wilmots, in which case you\u2019ll have no idea how to handle the talent at your disposal.  Roberto Di Matteo will take the Aston Villa job and bring the Champions League to Villa Park in 2019 after a Gabby Agbonlahor-inspired victory over Barcelona.  And finally, Bayern Munich have expressed surprise at Mario G\u00f6tze\u2019s George Costanza-esque refusal to accept that they don\u2019t want him around the place any longer. Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund are willing to give G\u00f6tze a new home. But if G\u00f6tze snubs Liverpool \u2013 the cheek! \u2013 then they\u2019ll go shopping at their favourite destination and sign Sadio Man\u00e9 from Southampton before amusing everyone by finishing below Southampton.",
