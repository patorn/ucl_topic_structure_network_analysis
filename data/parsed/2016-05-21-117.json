  "body": "Before I picked up Moby\u2019s new memoir, Porcelain, I thought of him as a small, bald, cheeky chappy who made tuneful dance music. I knew he had a few unconventional beliefs (wasn\u2019t he vegan? Hardcore Christian? Maybe teetotal?), but filed him as essentially harmless. After reading Porcelain, well\u2026 Let\u2019s just say his book is packed with incident. Lots of dodgy sex, oceans of alcohol, antics a-gogo. Plus: cockroaches, raves, death, celebrities (from Madonna to Robert Downey Jr, but not in starry situations) and good old Top Of The Pops. It\u2019s a romp of a book. Such outrageous fun, in fact, that Moby tells me he\u2019s noticed that people have regarded him differently after reading it. \u201cThey have a look,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s odd being on the receiving end of that look. It\u2019s a look of knowing, but it\u2019s also a look of concern. Like, \u2018Is everything OK?\u2019\u201d The fact is, his book makes me like Moby more. For a start, he writes brilliantly, with none of the self-indulgence of most pop memoirs: \u201cI wanted each chapter to be like an anecdote you\u2019d tell in a bar, to have a punchline,\u201d he says. And also, there\u2019s something touching about who he was back then. At one point, he writes this, about some club kids \u2013 \u201cThey were all doing obscene amounts of drugs and having sex with strangers, but they still seemed innocent\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly how he comes across. \u201cIt\u2019s quasi-Dickensian,\u201d he says. \u201cNaive boy from the country moves to the big city and things go wrong.\u201d We are drinking herbal tea and eating (very tasty) vegetables in Moby\u2019s newly opened vegan restaurant in blue-skied Los Angeles. It\u2019s a nice place and I am relaxed, but endearingly, Moby isn\u2019t. He picks up a fallen cushion and plumps it before putting it back on the bench; he asks me if I\u2019m too cold and alters the air con; he goes through the menu with me.    He was dance music\u2019s Adele: everyone liked his stuff. Then he blew it with a thrash punk LP    Moby has lived on the west coast for six years, but had no problem transporting himself back to his past for the book. Sometimes he would be writing about being blind drunk in New York, \u201ccovered in filth and squalor\u201d, and look up from his laptop and be shocked to see his swimming pool, bathed in sunshine. \u201cThe writing felt true and the reality felt like fiction. It was like time travel.\u201d Let\u2019s zoom back in time with him, then. Porcelain concerns itself with Moby\u2019s life between 1989 and 1999, from when he moved to New York to just before the release of Play, his fifth album, and the one that changed everything. Play was packed full of sample-heavy, catchy dance tunes, which buried themselves into everyday life. Even if you haven\u2019t actively listened to the album, you\u2019ll know the songs: Honey, with its driving piano riff and Bessie Jones sample \u201cget my honey come back, sometimes\u201d; Natural Blues, featuring another blues sample (\u201coh lordy, trouble so hard\u201d), this time from Vera Hall. (Moby sourced these samples, and others, from Alan Lomax\u2019s folk music field recordings.) Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad? has featured on the GSCE syllabus for music since 2008. Anyway, the big thing about Play was that every single one of its tracks was subsequently licensed for advertising or films. This was a huge deal at the time, and a huge deal for Moby. It moved him from the electronica shadows into the big league, changed him from a musician who scrabbled for a few thousand dollars to a fully fledged, in-the-spotlight, pop star overlord. For a while, Moby was dance music\u2019s Adele: everyone liked his stuff.     DJing in New York in 1989. Photograph: Moby\u2019s personal collection    None of this is hinted at in his memoir, however, because none of it was foreshadowed in real life. In real life, before Play, Moby was bumping around New York, getting DJ gigs in now legendary clubs like Mars and Nasa, as well as awful swingers\u2019 nights (he says he would play anywhere). His career, as careers do, took time. In 1992, he had success with one track, Go (particularly in the UK, where we have always been more open to his music than the US) and made a few well-received albums. Then, in 1995, just at the moment dance music really crossed over, he blew whatever small chance he had by bringing out a thrash punk LP. He is funny about this and his musical work is all present and correct in Porcelain, but it takes second place to the more fascinating everyday happenings in his life. He\u2019s a dominatrix\u2019s sidekick (he calls himself Master Bobby and shouts at a businessman wearing fuchsia lingerie). He gets Lyme disease, he dates indie girls and strippers; he lives in disused warehouses and crappy flats with weirded-out flatmates who want to set him on fire and buy the petrol to do so. What is strange is how he chose to compartmentalise his life. He bounced between out-there clubbers and the suburban devout, between hanging out in orgies and having a mostly unconsummated relationship with his Christian girlfriend (they would hand out vegan sandwiches to homeless people for thrills). He was monastic in his home habits, then would go out and socialise madly. He was a vegan, sober, nonsexual God-botherer partying in the blood-soaked Meatpacking District with the sex-and-druggers. In 1995, after being teetotal for eight years, he took up drinking again. There\u2019s a sort of relief in it. He had so many different personae to try to unite.     Reading Festival, 1996. Photograph: Scott Frassetto    Is he still like that? \u201cHmm. I still recognise that person, stumbling through life without much agency. There\u2019s enthusiasm and a good work ethic, but ultimately complete cluelessness, being baffled by everything. It\u2019s like being a snowball rolling down a mountain. The snowball might have started kind of pure, but by the end, it\u2019s filled with dead squirrels and sticks and rocks and wellies and garbage. You\u2019ve got this snowball at the end, but to what extent does it relate to or resemble that original snowball?\u201d Moby, as you see, does a good line in therapy talk (\u201cWell, we\u2019re in southern California, the land of veganism and therapy,\u201d he says), but he\u2019s also very funny. Salman Rushdie has given a glowing quote for the cover of Porcelain that references Moby\u2019s supposed ancestor Herman Melville (hence Moby, after Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick; his real name is Richard Melville Hall). He has started writing the next instalment, covering the 10 years post-Play. He says his publishers, so far, don\u2019t approve. They think his excesses make him too unsympathetic. Such as? \u201cOh, fame, money, degeneracy, debauchery, bottoming out,\u201d says Moby. What\u2019s not to like? \u201cI know! That\u2019s what I want to read in a book!\u201d Because it focuses on his life from 23 to 33 years old, Porcelain doesn\u2019t take on Moby\u2019s childhood. Still, tellingly, it opens with a scene concerning him and his mother. She is working in a laundromat, unhappy, furious, and he is sitting in the car, waiting for her to finish her shift. He is 10. He tells me he could have written a lot more about his young life \u2013 \u201cthere are maybe five memoirs in there\u201d \u2013 and he clearly had a tough time. His father died in a drink-driving accident when Moby was just two. His mother\u2019s family was wealthy (Moby\u2019s grandfather ran a successful Wall Street company), but she rejected her background and set off to make her own story. \u201cSometimes we would be living in a squat-ish house with three or four other drug-addicted hippies, with bands playing in the basement,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich sounds fun, but when you\u2019re in fourth grade trying to do homework and there are people smoking pot in the kitchen, or fighting\u2026\u201d Every so often, they would stay with his grandparents in wealthy Darien, Connecticut, which was nice, but made him feel poor and ashamed.    We lived in a squat, with hippies and bands. Which sounds fun, but not when you\u2019re in fourth grade, doing homework       With his mother, wearing her chemotherapy wig, in New York, 1997. Photograph: Moby\u2019s personal collection    In the second half of the book, his mum dies of cancer, and there\u2019s an awful \u2013 almost unbelievable \u2013 incident that happens around her funeral. \u201cI remember it so clearly,\u201d Moby says. \u201cSomeone had left a digital alarm clock at my house, and it was the most reliable thing in the world, and the alarm was as clear and easy to use as a digital clock can be. And so, the night before my mom\u2019s funeral, I set the alarm. But this completely reliable clock at some point was set forward 21 hours, which meant that if it were 3am it somehow got set forward to midnight. The only thing that could have happened is that, at some point during the night, I woke up in a fugue state and set the clock forward 21 hours, so I would miss her funeral\u2026 I must have set it forward 21 hours, because something in my subconscious said that was the only legitimate and expedient way to miss the funeral.\u201d I ask him how he feels about that now, and his eyes mist up a tiny bit. He is sad: not for himself, but for his family. \u201cShe was my mom, but more importantly in some ways she was my aunts\u2019 sister. And my grandmother\u2019s daughter. I feel guilty. But for myself, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Not knowing how you feel about things is a protective instinct. Moby is a lovely companion, in real life and on the page, but he can seem detached from his emotions. When his mum told him she had cancer, she also told him that he has a half-brother. I ask him about this, assuming he would have got in touch. But no. \u201cIf it were a full brother, then that would be interesting, but it\u2019s a half-brother,\u201d he says. (\u201cIt\u201d!). \u201cIn terms of my genetic sequence, I have almost as much in common with you and most of the people in this restaurant as I would with a half-brother.\u201d And that\u2019s that. What Porcelain suggests is that Moby\u2019s greatest love back then wasn\u2019t his family, or a person, or even music, but a city. At heart, Porcelain is a love letter to old New York: that grubby, crumbling, dangerous place. Recently, Moby was describing it to some young friends, and they couldn\u2019t believe what he was describing; honouring the city of that time was a major motivation in his writing. \u201cNew York completely changed in those 10 years. In 1989, it was old New York\u2026 cheap, murder-y, dysfunctional, fires\u2026 and by the end of the 90s, it was Jay Z and bottle service and condos.\u201d     In his first promo shoot in 1988. Photograph: Joseph Kugielsky    It took Moby a long time to fall out of love with New York, but he did. He gave up drink and his love ended. \u201cI was walking up Orchard Street, and it was one of those shitty days, 36 degrees Fahrenheit, sleeting, grey snow, and I realised there is sometimes an elective quality to suffering.\u201d New York suited his drinking; he classifies himself as \u201can old-timey alcoholic, I mean, there\u2019s just no doubt, you know?\u201d He would try going out for a couple of drinks and find himself \u201cat 8am, with strangers in my house, bags of drugs, I\u2019d had about 15 drinks, having sex with a complete stranger. Which is great, but that was my best attempt to drink in moderation. Also, I thought I was going on these great adventures, and the truth is I was going from one bar to another on Ludlow Street.\u201d So he got sober and moved to LA. For a while, he lived in Marlon Brando\u2019s old house, the fabulous Wolf\u2019s Lair, an actual castle, but it soon felt too big. Now he\u2019s in a three-bedroom place: his musical equipment is in one bedroom, his exercise stuff in another, and he sleeps in the third. Hardly Jay Z, but he seems happy. In the past few years, Moby has reassessed his life. He wants to carry on making music \u2013 he has an album coming out this year \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t want to tour. He\u2019s happy for people to pay for his music, but he doesn\u2019t mind giving it away and, to this end, has set up a website so that student filmmakers can use his albums as soundtracks for free. He\u2019s stopped caring what other people think of him (not much social media, just occasionally posting on Instagram, mostly cute animals or nature scenes). And he\u2019s decided that animal rights are his life\u2019s work. \u201cThat\u2019s my day job \u2013 animal rights,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking music and writing books and doing other things is what I love, and it\u2019s fun, but I don\u2019t see it as work. You know, a lot of activism is single-issue activism. Like say, someone campaigns about turning land into a park. There\u2019s the land, you turn it into a park, it benefits the community \u2013 that\u2019s good. But it\u2019s limited. But the thing with animal agriculture, everything is covered by it. There\u2019s the animal side of it: most people who are not sociopaths can agree that animal suffering is not a good thing. But then there\u2019s the climate change aspect, the rainforest deforestation, famine \u2013 the reason there\u2019s famine is because food that could be fed to humans is fed to animals instead \u2013 then heart disease, diabetes, cancer, erectile dysfunction\u2026 Animal activism is my life\u2019s purpose. If someone came to me and said if I could die, and my death would somehow serve the purpose of saving animals, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.\u201d Then of course, there\u2019s the restaurant, which he finds a constant trial. \u201cEverything has to be perfect. I\u2019m an emotional perfectionist \u2013 I just want things to feel as good as they possibly can for the people who are experiencing them.\u201d He did have another vegan restaurant, in New York, called TeaNY, which he opened in 2002, with his then girlfriend. This was a disaster, as they split up soon after, and, though they\u2019re still on good terms, he doesn\u2019t seem to know if TeaNY is still going. Relationships don\u2019t appear to be Moby\u2019s forte: he hooks up with a couple of women in the book who seem great, but he can\u2019t make it last. Was he just a sex dog? \u201cI don\u2019t think I was driven by sex. The way I dated was motived by the desire to be validated in someone\u2019s eyes. And clearly the desire to have sex as well, but it was like seeking validation without attachment or obligation.\u201d     Moby calls himself a \u2018developmentally disabled space alien or robot\u2019. Photograph: Chris Buck for the Guardian    He also thinks his difficulties with his mum had an effect. \u201cIf you\u2019re constantly ashamed when you\u2019re growing up, when you become an adult you\u2019re constantly ashamed. And when you get close to people you assume they will only like you as long as they see you in your best light. There is the profound desire for closeness and the profound fear of the other person. You start getting close to someone, they do something that might not be perfect, and it triggers a terror response and you run away\u2026 By you, I mean me, of course.\u201d Anyway, he\u2019s been in a relationship for eight months now, his first in 10 years. It seems to be going OK, though he can\u2019t really tell. He calls himself a \u201cdevelopmentally disabled space alien or robot\u201d and he keeps having to ask his girlfriend things: \u201cLike, is it OK if I go to bed after you do?\u201d He\u2019s also pretty set on not having children. He says, \u201cif the person I\u2019m dating got pregnant, sure \u2013 I\u2019d happily be involved and help out as much as I possibly can, but it\u2019s not something I long to do\u201d, which is about as detached as you can get without running away. He\u2019s going to adopt a couple of dogs after he comes back from his book tour, he thinks. He seems able to feel great emotion for humanity and animals in general, but finds it harder one-on-one. We talk a little bit about his Christianity; towards the end of the book, he starts questioning it, and he says now that he still understands the desire for spirituality, just not institutionalised belief systems or \u201cideological rigidity\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think that God cares what jersey you wear,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Man United and Leeds\u2026 is that the right UK sports reference?\u201d Leeds aren\u2019t in the Premiership any more. \u201cOK, Arsenal? Man United and Arsenal: that tribal rivalry is really fun in sport, but I don\u2019t think it should be part of divinity.\u201d We are having a laugh now; I feel as though I\u2019m talking to a friend. Moby is quite the most low-key multimillionaire I have ever met. He is modest. He looks the way he always did: unflashy with his shirt over a T-shirt, creative casual, unrich. He hasn\u2019t even had his teeth done, which is almost prosecutable in LA. We talk a bit about money and he says he thinks materialism doesn\u2019t work, meaning it doesn\u2019t actually make anyone properly happy. He should know, of course.     On stage at Le Z\u00e9nith in Paris in 2015. Photograph: Getty Images    Moby seems to be enjoying his life, now he\u2019s not spending a big part of it drunk. \u201cI love reading and travelling to interesting parts of the world, and having time to think and write and make music and do activism. Life is short, and we have a limited amount of time and energy, and it\u2019s just so much easier trying to be your honest self.\u201d I take the opportunity to ask him about a long-standing rumour. Supposedly, years ago, Moby and his friends would play a prank at parties. One of them would unzip his flies and hang his willy out of his trousers, then the others would challenge him to go up to someone famous and \u201cknob touch\u201d them. I ask him if this ever happened, or if it was made up. \u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d he says, and pauses. \u201cHmm, there\u2019s a funny side to this story. I might change it because I don\u2019t know if I want it to follow me around. I had some friends from college who would do that. They would get very drunk, pull their willy out and just brush it up against people. Because it was funny. So what I will say is that a friend of mine once did that to Donald Trump.\u201d I laugh. \u201cIt was a restaurant on Park Avenue around 20th Street, some fundraising event, when Trump was just a New York real-estate developer.\u201d You seem to remember it well. Did that person get extra kudos for Trump? \u201cYou can extrapolate as to who that person might be, and that\u2019s as much as I can say,\u201d says Moby, a man who can\u2019t resist a funny anecdote, who\u2019s happy to tell the truth, who has lived a full and full-on life \u2013 but who is old enough now to know that he doesn\u2019t want all the consequences that come wrapped in the adventures. Fair enough. As long as he keeps writing all those stories down, we\u2019re good.  Porcelain by Moby is published by Faber & Faber at \u00a314.99.
