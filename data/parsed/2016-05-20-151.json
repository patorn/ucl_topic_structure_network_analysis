  "body": "The Spanish film-maker Pedro Almod\u00f3var has criticised Hollywood for its failure to find stronger roles for women of all ages. Speaking at the Cannes film festival, where his new film Julieta debuts in competition, the Oscar-winning director of All About My Mother and Talk to Her said female stars were often only included in blockbuster franchises to prove the male leads were not gay.

Related: Cannes day six: Kristen Stewart, Pedro Almodovar and Rossy de Palma - in pictures    Almodovar, who has worked with grande dames of world cinema such as Cecilia Roth, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Carmen Maura and Rossy de Palma, lamented the fact that older Hollywood stars such as Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon had been pushed increasingly towards roles on the small screen, while European actors such as Isabelle Huppert and Juliette Binoche still found meaty roles in film. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of diabolical sexism, and I say that it\u2019s diabolical because there\u2019s no one that we can actually accuse of being responsible for this sexism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roles are out there for someone like Meryl Streep, but they\u2019re not out there for the others.\u201d",
