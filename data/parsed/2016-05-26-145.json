  "body": "The much-awaited State Department report yesterday declared that Hillary Clinton broke some rules concerning her email management as secretary of state. The verdict taints her but does not deliver a knockout punch. Clinton does not deserve the slammer or political burial. However, Donald Trump has been ranting for months that \u201cshe should be going to prison for what she\u2019s done with the emails\u201d. But facts do not support that statement. She was chastised for her use of private email but so was former Republican secretary of state Colin Powell. The department itself was criticized too for not modernizing communications over the years and for failing to impose proper supervision in an era of growing cybersecurity threats. Donald\u2019s parallel universe of character assassination aside, I believe Clinton is guilty of a misdemeanor \u2013 not a crime. A FBI investigation still lingers, looking into whether her handling of classified information was illegal. But reports suggest that officials have yet to find that she \u201cmaliciously flouted classification rules.\u201d Clearly, however, she\u2019s been bruised, even if exonerated from criminality.  Her defense has also been bruised. She maintained that a private email server was a \u201cconvenience\u201d that allowed her to deal with only one smartphone and one email address, rather than two of each. She has further stated that \u201cit was permitted. I did it. It turned out to be a mistake. It was not the best choice.\u201d Unfortunately, yesterday\u2019s report stated that no permission was granted, nor was it sought by her. In this respect, she put herself above the rules within the department. Trump continued yesterday to declare that the email controversy proves she\u2019s a crook even though only the FBI and the courts can determine criminality, not him. But his repetitious, unproven slanders about her won\u2019t end. Unlike other countries with libel and slander protections, the United States considers public figures fair game and they can be maligned with impunity. Trump has mastered the art of the smear. Yesterday, he said again that Clinton was \u201cas crooked as they come. She had a little bad news today as you know. Some reports [that] came down weren\u2019t so good.\u201d  He also slammed two other prominent women \u2013 the most successful Hispanic Republican politician in America, Susana Martinez, governor of New Mexico, as well as Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cShe\u2019s [Martinez] not doing the job. We\u2019ve got to get her moving. Come on. Let\u2019s go, governor,\u201d Trump said to the crowd. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll run for governor of New Mexico. I\u2019ll get this place going.\u201d His animus toward Martinez is because she refuses to endorse him and boycotted his rally in her state yesterday. Senator Warren is a favorite Trump whipping girl whom he calls \u201cPocahontas\u201d, because she has Native American heritage, and whom he has labelled as a \u201ctotal failure\u201d as a politician.  Clinton\u2019s other rival, senator Bernie Sanders, ignored the email controversy yesterday and pledged to stick to issues. During the campaign trail, he has stated that the American people were sick of Clinton\u2019s \u201cdamn emails\u201d. Following yesterday\u2019s wrist-slap report, Sanders campaign chair Jeff Weaver said \u201cthe report speaks for itself. This is obviously an area where the senator has chosen not to go.\u201d A cranky Sanders said in an interview in California that he had been asked \u201cfive million times\u201d about the emails and won\u2019t comment about that or about Bill Clinton\u2019s personal life. But Trump is an unrelenting muckraker and will continue to hammer away about Bill Clinton\u2019s old sexual escapades in an attempt to impugn Clinton\u2019s character. His strategy of insults has won him television ratings and polling results so far. But the general election is not American Idol. The media is riveted to his performances, but there is widespread concern about his intemperate, unsubstantiated and crude outbursts. And November is months away.",
