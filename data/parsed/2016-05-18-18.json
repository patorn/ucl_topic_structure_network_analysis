  "body": "LIVERPOOL   Related: Sevilla\u2019s knowhow leaves the Liverpool Europa League party to fall flat | Barney Ronay    Simon Mignolet 5 Hardly called into action during a one-sided opening half but forced to pick the ball out of his net 20 seconds into the second period and, despite denying Gameiro a second, may have been a little stronger for Coke\u2019s second. Nathaniel Clyne 6 Got forward plenty early on and provided some decent crosses, most notably finding Sturridge at the back post, but could not keep up the pace and was found wanting when Sevilla burst into life. Exhausted by 70 minutes. Dejan Lovren 6 Took one for the team when taking down Gameiro during a Sevilla counterattack, picking up a yellow card. Found the net with a header ruled out due to Sturridge being offside but struggled to tame Sevilla\u2019s striker. Kolo Tour\u00e9 7 Rock solid in the first half and led the backline impressively until they collectively tired once Sevilla equalised. He did make a goal-saving tackle on Gameiro at 1-1 and was not individually at fault for any of the goals. Alberto Moreno 4 Dismal. Yet again culpable in the buildup to a concession in this tournament. His meek attempt to halt Mariano \u2013 in the end being nutmegged \u2013 allowed the right-back into a prime position to pick out Gameiro for 1-1. James Milner 6 Unsurprisingly showed gaspingly high energy levels but appeared unsure how to deal with Sevilla\u2019s intricate movement when they started playing to their usual level in the second half. Eventually Banega went past him with ease. Emre Can 6 Not the worst player on the pitch, but nowhere near the best. Enjoyed Liverpool\u2019s first chance with a mid-range effort that was parried away by Soria but faded along with the rest of his team. Adam Lallana 5 Exemplified the press desired by Klopp with a fine challenge on Escudero eight minutes in and played a tasty disguised pass to Sturridge but went missing in the second half before being substituted. Roberto Firmino 4 Liverpool\u2019s joint-biggest disappointment. It frustrates that a player with such ability can be so inconsistent. Taken off just before Sevilla\u2019s third with his individual standout moment forcing Carri\u00e7o into an early handball.           J\u00fcrgen Klopp defiant after Liverpool lose Europa League final to Sevilla.    Philippe Coutinho 4 Similar to Firmino, a night of anonymity for the Brazilian. It says plenty that his lasting impact was deflecting the ball into Coke\u2019s path for Sevilla\u2019s third goal. Finally did something in attack 80 minutes in: shooting over the bar. Daniel Sturridge 8 Made some excellent runs off the ball in the opening stages to leave Rami and Carri\u00e7o in his wake. His goal was outstanding but he also had several chances to add to it and denied Lovren from making it 2-0 by being offside. SEVILLA   Related: Coke double shakes Liverpool as Sevilla hit back to win Europa League final    David Soria 7 Much was made before kick-off of the 23-year-old\u2019s lack of experience but he did barely anything wrong. Actually, he had nothing to do for long spells and there was little he could have done to keep out Sturridge\u2019s pearler. Mariano 7  Gave Sturridge too much space for his goal \u2013 if he was a bit tighter, the striker would not have had the angle to finish so brilliantly \u2013 but redeemed himself well with a powerful run forward and assist for Gameiro\u2019s equaliser. Adil Rami 6 Like many in white shirts, he made an unconvincing start to the game and was unsure of how to pick up Sturridge\u2019s unpredictable movement. Eventually got to grips with the striker, though. Booked, then substituted. Daniel Carri\u00e7o 6 A tad fortunate not to give away a penalty in the 12th minute for handball with Firmino running at him and he allowed Sturridge far too much space to roam early on. But he had nothing to do after the interval. Sergio Escudero 7 Not helped by Vitiolo\u2019s reluctance to track back and, with Clyne pushing forward, had a busy opening 45 minutes. When Clyne eventually ran out of energy, he was allowed to push forward more often. Grzegorz Krychowiak 7 Broke up play well as one of the two holding midfielders. Did plenty of the dirty work that so often goes unnoticed and kept Coutinho and Firmino on a tighter leash than most. Unlikely to feature in too many highlight packages. Steven N\u2019Zonzi 7 Similar to Krychowiak, he put in the hard yards. Almost teed up Gameiro an hour in and was allowed to push forward and put Liverpool under further pressure in the second half. Only Banega played more passes. Coke 9  Subdued in the opening half but was at the heart of Sevilla\u2019s fight back and the finish for his first to put Sevilla in front, precisely tucked into Mignolet\u2019s bottom left corner, was as delicious as Sturridge\u2019s. \u00c9ver Banega 7 In a free role, dropped too deep too often to have a real impact on the game during the early exchanges, but once Gameiro made it 1-1, he seemed to up several gears and Liverpool struggled to keep tabs on him. Vitolo 7   Too often lazy when tracking back and allowed Lallana plenty of one-on-one opportunities with Escudero but his attacking impact in the second half was crucial to Sevilla\u2019s comeback. He could be first-rate if he was consistent. K\u00e9vin Gameiro 8 Had a quiet first half \u2013 an overhead kick that darted narrowly wide aside \u2013 but finished calmly to make it 1-1 and could have easily had a hat-trick by the hour mark in an outstanding second half. Excellent.",
