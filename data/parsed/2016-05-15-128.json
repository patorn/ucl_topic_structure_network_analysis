We all try our best but there are times when things go horribly wrong. I should know. In July last year I sat down to write an article about Claudio Ranieri. The 63-year-old had just been appointed the new manager of Leicester City and I decided, in the capacity of being the football editor at the Guardian, that I was the right person to write that piece.   Related: Claudio Ranieri: the anti-Pearson \u2026 and the wrong man for Leicester City? | Marcus Christenson    I made that decision based on the following: I have lived and worked as a journalist in Italy and have followed Ranieri\u2019s career fairly closely since his early days in management. I also made sure that I spoke to several people in Greece, where Ranieri\u2019s last job before replacing Nigel Pearson at Leicester, had ended in disaster with the team losing against the Faroe Islands and the manager getting sacked. It was quite clear to me that this was a huge gamble by Leicester and that it was unlikely to end well. And I was hardly the only one to be sceptical. Gary Lineker, the former Leicester striker and now Match of the Day presenter, tweeted \u201cClaudio Ranieri? Really?\u201d and followed it up with by saying: \u201cClaudio Ranieri is clearly experienced, but this is an uninspired choice by Leicester. It\u2019s amazing how the same old names keep getting a go on the managerial merry-go-round.\u201d I started my article by explaining what had gone wrong in Greece (which was several things) before moving on to talk about the rest of his long managerial career, pointing out that he had never won a league title in any country and nor had he stayed at any club for more than two seasons since being charge at Chelsea at the beginning of the 2000s. I threw in some light-hearted \u201clines\u201d, such as the fact that he was the manager in charge of Juventus when they signed Christian Poulsen (not really a Juventus kind of player) and proclaimed that the appointment was \u201cbaffling\u201d. I added: \u201cIn some ways, it seems as if the Leicester owners went looking for the anti-Nigel Pearson. Ranieri is not going to call a journalist an ostrich. He is not going to throttle a player during a match. He is not going to tell a supporter to \u2018fuck off and die\u2019, no matter how bad the abuse gets.\u201d     Claudio Ranieri instructs his players during Greece\u2019s defeat by the Faroe Islands, the Italian\u2019s last game in charge of the Euro 2004 winners. Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP    Rather pleased with myself \u2013 thinking that I was giving the readers a good insight to the man and the manager \u2013 I also put a headline on the piece, which read: \u201cClaudio Ranieri: the anti-Pearson \u2026 and the wrong man for Leicester City?\u201d I did not think much more of the piece until a few months later when Leicester were top of the league and showing all the signs of being capable of staying there. After a while, the tweets started to appear from people pointing out that I may not have called this one right. As the season wore on, these tweets became more and more frequent, and they have been sent to me after every Leicester win since the turn of the year. At some point in February I decided to go back and look at the piece again. It made for uncomfortable reading. I had said that describing his spell in charge of Greece as \u201cpoor\u201d would be an understatement. I wrote that 11 years after being given the nickname \u201cTinkerman\u201d because he changed his starting XI so often when in charge of Chelsea, he was still an incorrigible \u201cTinkerman\u201d. It gets worse. \u201cFew will back him to succeed but one thing is for sure: he will conduct himself in an honourable and humble way, as he always has done,\u201d the articles said. \u201cIf Leicester wanted someone nice, they\u2019ve got him. If they wanted someone to keep them in the Premier League, then they may have gone for the wrong guy.\u201d Ouch. Reading it back again I was faced with a couple of uncomfortable questions, the key one being \u201cwho do you think you are, writing such an snobbish piece about a dignified man and a good manager?\u201d   Related: In defence of Nicklas Bendtner | Marcus Christenson    The second question was a bit easier to answer. Was this as bad as the \u201cIn defence of Nicklas Bendtner\u201d article I wrote a couple of years ago? (The answer is \u201cno\u201d, by the way, few things come close to an error of judgment of that scale). I would like to point out a few things though. I did get \u2013 as a very kind colleague pointed out \u2013 50% of that last paragraph right. He clearly is a wonderful human being and when Paolo Bandini spoke to several of his former players recently one thing stood out: the incredible affection they still feel for this gentle 64-year-old. All in all, though, there is no point defending the indefensible: I could not have got it more wrong.           Leicester City and the tactics of champions.    At the start of this piece I said that no one likes to be wrong. Well, I was wrong about that too. I\u2019ve enjoyed every minute of being embarrassingly wrong this season. Leicester is the best story that could have happened to football in this country, their triumph giving hope to all of us who want to start a season dreaming that something unthinkable might happen. So thank you Leicester and thank you Claudio, it\u2019s been quite wonderful. \u2022 Marcus Christenson is the football editor at the Guardian.
