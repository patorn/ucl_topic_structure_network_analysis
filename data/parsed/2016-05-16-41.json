  "body": "Finally, after weeks of obfuscation, it looks like we have our killer, though knowing Marcella there might be one further daft twist to come. Tonight\u2019s episode was perhaps the most engrossing so far, and it certainly left plenty to wrap up in tomorrow\u2019s finale. I have to confess I\u2019m intrigued to see how the whole thing pans out, which isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve said very often about this hugely patchy series. Detective. Witness. Suspect. Who\u2019d be Marcella, eh? Clonked over the head with a foreign object at the close of last week\u2019s episode, she wakes at the start of this one to find herself tied up with a knife held to her throat. The man holding the knife, Mo, wants her to confess to her crime, even if he\u2019s not 100% sure she was the perpetrator. Marcella slipped into her fugue state, which prevented us from finding out whether or not she did deliver that confession, but the fact that Mo was nowhere to be seen when she came round probably doesn\u2019t bode well. Either she fessed up or Mo\u2019s been given an even more severe kicking than that bathroom bin the other week.  If Marcella\u2019s problems were limited to strange men breaking into her house and holding her at knifepoint, she\u2019d probably be fairly content with the world. But no, the spectre of Marcella\u2019s breakup with Jason looms as large as Mo did in her living room, with her estranged partner continuing to stroll into the family home unannounced and still managing to hold the upper hand with her kids, particularly her eldest daughter. Well, until Marcella \u2013 at a school talent show, of all places \u2013 decides to reveal that Jason was responsible for the breakup by having an affair. Her confrontation with Jason later on \u2013 where she took back the house keys and told him a reconciliation was a complete non-starter \u2013 felt significant: Marcella\u2019s obsession with him, and grief at their breakup, has defined her for so much of this season, so saying no to him feels an important step forward. Now all she has to do is catch the Grove Park killer, and hopefully avoid going to prison for abetting said killer, and all will be right with the world. Also under suspicion     Who had Henry in the serial killer sweepstake? Photograph: ITV    Right then, who had Henry in the serial killer sweepstake? I certainly didn\u2019t, despite suspecting just about everyone else on Marcella\u2019s lengthy cast list. Perhaps it should have been obvious: jilted stepson with \u201cgreen credentials\u201d (a sure sign of villainy in this post-Zac Goldsmith world) and slicked-back hair. He even gave a tearful speech at Grace\u2019s funeral, the monster. Now Henry has Matthew, the murder unit\u2019s prime suspect due to his proximity to the killings, locked in his basement, while he serves chablis to the Gibsons upstairs ... In truth, when you tally the evidence, Henry\u2019s involvement does add up. He knew Matthew since childhood, so would have been around for the original murders (which Matthew gave evidence in). He would feasibly have access to Matthew\u2019s computer systems, what with Matthew working for him. Presumably he\u2019s been present at Matthew\u2019s house, where he would have had the opportunity to drop off electrical tape and tie binds and swipe that keycard. He\u2019s even been to Marcella\u2019s house, where he would have been able to have a squiz at her massive wall of crime and check he wasn\u2019t a suspect. Admittedly, it\u2019s unclear what connection he had to the people he was bumping off, but I\u2019m hopeful that the show can at least tie all that up in tomorrow\u2019s finale. A nicely disguised twist then, but I can\u2019t help but feel that its wow factor has been undermined by the show\u2019s convoluted plotting. All the suspects, killings, attempted killings, copycat killings, and general plot flotsam has obscured the simple issue of innocence and guilt, meaning that Marcella has become less of a \u201cwhodunit\u201d than a \u201cwho dun what again?\u201d Indeed, I\u2019m still confused over the issue of this killer v copycat killer business \u2013 are we now meant to think that Cullen (who confessed to the original killings) was just the ersatz present-day killer, and Henry was the original killer? Or was Cullen only responsible for Maddy\u2019s attempted murder and Henry did the rest? And what of that baker back in episode two \u2013 was he a copycat copycat? I\u2019m expecting a full hour of exposition just to clear all this up. Other goings on     \u2018Is it really that much better without air?\u2019 DCI Laura Porter had tonight\u2019s best one-liner. Photograph: Amanda Searle    Ah, Bendik, we hardly knew thee. And what a peculiar way to go, too: auto-erotic asphyxiation, to the soundtrack of punishing black metal. Initially I thought that said auto-erotic asphyxiation was another of Stuart\u2019s artfully faked suicides, but the frantic way he turned over Bendik\u2019s room to search for his phone suggested otherwise. Quite why he didn\u2019t actually check Bendik\u2019s body for possessions, I\u2019m not sure, but now the phone is in police hands, which is bad news for both Stuart and Jason, what with it containing those compromising pictures of an envelope being passed between the pair. What\u2019s more Tim, Marcella\u2019s other love interest, is firmly on Jason\u2019s trail, and even the Gibson family are starting to suspect he might have something to do with Andrew Bailey\u2019s death. I wouldn\u2019t put it past this most ludicrous of shows to land Henry, Jason and Marcella in prison by the end of the final episode ... Notes and observations  Why hasn\u2019t Henry killed Matthew? Affection for his oldest friend? Or concern that Matthew\u2019s death might draw the police to him.  Or perhaps a bit of both? Stuart finally came clean to his wife about his MS after he wet himself during the Bendik incident.  This episode\u2019s finest line came from DCI Porter responding to Bendik\u2019s death. \u201cIs it really that much better without air?\u201d",
