  "body": "The role was originated by Jessica Tandy, played on stage and screen by Vivien Leigh and has attracted major stars for almost 70 years including, most recently, Gillian Anderson whose portrayal won acclaim in London and can currently be seen in New York. Now, Maxine Peake is preparing to take on the part of Tennessee Williams\u2019s troubled southern belle Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire. The production, at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester, continues Peake\u2019s creative collaboration with Sarah Frankcom, who directed her as Hamlet in a 2014 production and as Caryl Churchill\u2019s shape-shifting Skriker at the Manchester international festival last year. Streetcar will start its five-week run on 8 September. Peake told the Guardian she and Frankcom are currently just \u201cat the beginning of asking who Blanche is\u201d. Commenting on the character\u2019s enduring appeal for actors and audiences, she said: \u201cLook at the people we are obsessed with in the press \u2013 people who have addictive personalities, people who seem to be on a self-destructive path \u2026 I have got a very perverse fascination with those sorts of characters.\u201d      Peake as Hamlet in the Royal Exchange\u2019s cross-gendered production in 2014. Photograph: Jonathan Keenan    When asked if she has considered the character\u2019s accent, Peake joked \u201cWe\u2019re setting it in Bolton\u201d before saying the production will keep the southern US setting of Williams\u2019s 1947 play but perhaps not be set in its original era. Frankcom said their version \u201cwon\u2019t be located in the naturalism of when it was written but it also won\u2019t feel stridently contemporary. It will fit in its own world\u201d. Frankcom believes Williams\u2019s characters are compelling because they have \u201ca past, a present and a future\u201d. She added: \u201cThere\u2019s something about Blanche in particular. Any female theatre director is going to find her a really dazzling and attractive character but also quite troubling as well.\u201d According to Frankcom, the play\u2019s strength \u2013 and what makes it feel \u201cunerringly new\u201d in each production \u2013 is its depiction of the fragility of addiction. From her first scenes in the play, it is clear that Blanche is an alcoholic. \u201cWilliams wrote from the frontline of addiction himself,\u201d said Frankcom.  Elia Kazan, who directed the play\u2019s Broadway debut and the Oscar-nominated film version, once observed: \u201cTennessee Williams equals Blanche. He is Blanche.\u201d The playwright became dependent on drugs and alcohol throughout his life. Peake said she will explore parallels between the dramatist and his creation by reading Williams\u2019s memoirs and the acclaimed biography by John Lahr, Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh.

She said: \u201cI always thought I wasn\u2019t the Tennessee Williams type. Perhaps I got that from drama school.\u201d She remarked on the dangers of being pigeonholed and being told \u201cwhat you can and can\u2019t play\u201d early on in your career. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to take hold of the reins yourself and say, \u2018You know what? Actually, we\u2019re all actors, we can all have a go.\u2019\u201d Peake graduated from Rada in 1998 and found fame on TV: she starred in Victoria Wood\u2019s sitcom Dinnerladies that year and went on to appear in Paul Abbott\u2019s Channel 4 series Shameless and as Myra Hindley in See No Evil: The Moors Murders. Her recent credits in the theatre include writing a play about the cyclist Beryl Burton and starring at the Royal Court in London in Zinnie Harris\u2019s dystopian drama How to Hold Your Breath. Later this month, she will be seen as the fairy queen Titania in a BBC1 version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream adapted by Russell T Davies.            Maxine Peake performs \u2018To be, or not to be?\u2019 in Hamlet    Frankcom described Peake as \u201can actor who operates with the brakes off\u201d and said that she thrives in an ensemble. \u201cShe has no sense of what she\u2019s doing until she\u2019s in a room with other people \u2026 That\u2019s often very bracing, often quite scary. You don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to end up. But it\u2019s utterly thrilling.\u201d  Frankcom said she started working with Peake \u201cwhen I was relatively inexperienced. We\u2019ve sort of grown up together. I have the great privilege of knowing that I can push her. Because of the way we have to work in the British theatre, you don\u2019t have that long to rehearse. You need to arrive somewhere quite quickly. When you have an ongoing creative relationship with an actor you kind of have a head start.\u201d   Related: Maxine Peake: \u2018I\u2019d like a go at playing Henry V. Yeah! Who knows?\u2019    The majority of the pair\u2019s collaborations have been staged at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange, where Peake began her acting career in the youth theatre. Frankcom has been its artistic director since 2008 and Peake is now one of the theatre\u2019s associate artists.  Although it seats about 700 people, it is an intimate space. \u201cThe audience are right there \u2013 they are sitting on the stage,\u201d said Peake. \u201cWhen we were doing Hamlet, one of the actors asked me if I had any tips for working at the Royal Exchange. I said: \u2018Try and avoid the Asda bags on the front row on a Saturday matinee.\u2019 They come in and plonk their shopping down and if you get a bit too carried away you can end up with someone\u2019s week\u2019s shopping around your ankles. But I love that \u2026 It feels like a comfortable space for the audience. It\u2019s not them and us. We\u2019re all in it together.\u201d  Further casting for A Streetcar Named Desire will be announced at a later date. Additional details of the Royal Exchange\u2019s new season will be released on Tuesday afternoon.",
