According to a lawsuit that Taylor Guerrero and Courtney Wilson filed against Officer Bobby Harrison and the city, Harrison saw the then vacationing couple kissing in a store aisle and told them to \u201ctake it somewhere else\u201d. Later the women ran into him again, and he threatened to throw them out of the store. While the women were in the checkout line, they allege, Harrison grabbed them and tried to throw them out of the store. A scuffle ensued, and he arrested the two and charged them with felony assault of an officer. Harrison declined to comment for this article, saying that he could not comment until after the settlement was finished, in July. An internal investigation by the Honolulu police department found that \u201cthe allegations were not sustained\u201d, according to the department spokeswoman. Harrison has since retired. As part of the settlement, Harrison was dismissed from the lawsuit, said Nicolette Winter, a Honolulu deputy corporation counsel, but it was not an admission of wrongdoing. Both Guerrero and Wilson said they were ready to move on, but added that the case has had lasting effects on their lives. \u201cIt\u2019s already been a year later and you have this dark cloud hanging over you. You just want everything to go away and be done with, but you forget how hard it was,\u201d Wilson said. Due to the seriousness of the felony assault charges against them, the women were not allowed to leave the island until after the ruling. In order to make bail, they paid a non-refundable $2,600. It was the last of their money. Without any connections on Oahu, they had few options. They worked cleaning vacation rentals in Ewa Beach, where they bounced between living in parks and shelters and on the couches of compassionate strangers. They often spent nights at a 24/7 McDonald\u2019s in Pearl City, and then slept in Wilson\u2019s hammock in the park during the day.  Twice a week, they had to complete a six-hour round-trip commute by bus and foot to check in for bail. After a few months, they met a couple in Waikiki who let the women with stay with them. There, it was easier to get around and they had more work opportunities. \u201cIt put a lot of strain on our relationship. This was supposed to be a romantic vacation in Hawaii before we moved in together in Los Angeles,\u201d Guerrero said, \u201cbut instead it turned into this really horrible nightmare.\u201d Guerrero originally had a job to go back to in Los Angeles, but lost it when she couldn\u2019t return after her original two-week vacation. Wilson had been in the process of enrolling in a linguistics program and wanted to be a translator for the Air Force. She was one step away from completing the process when she was detained in Hawaii, and her application fell through. \u201cI got crazy depressed and lost focus on what I wanted to do and what my plans were, and everything just spiraled downwards,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cNow I\u2019m just trying to put my life back together.\u201d After the criminal charges were dropped, the women went their separate ways. Wilson moved back to Los Angeles and Guerrero stayed in Hawaii. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll reconnect one day,\u201d says Wilson, \u201cbut everything that happened just kind of ripped us apart.\u201d The women say they\u2019re disappointed Harrison was not punished. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a public apology from him,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSure, we wanted compensation, but we mainly wanted to see the officer punished for what he did to us,\u201d said Guerrero in an interview Monday. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had to go through those seven months if he hadn\u2019t harassed us in the first place.\u201d \u201cOur lawyers highly advised us to take the settlement due to the likelihood of an unfavorable jury in Hawaii,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe would have liked to have seen the officer be held accountable for his actions. He didn\u2019t have to do anything or pay anything. But our lawyers told us if we lost the case, we would have owed something like $150,000 in legal fees. Of course when you throw a number like that at two girls, it\u2019s quite discouraging.\u201d Wilson is now living and working in Los Angeles, while in Hawaii, Guerrero has a job she enjoys in Waikiki and an apartment with new friends. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of great people here since everything happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy here.\u201d In addition to the settlement, the women also received a $10,000 settlement from the grocery store. After the women pay off their legal fees, Taylor said she expects for them each to walk away with roughly $31,000. Guerrero said she hoped to take a trip to Asia after she receives her settlement. Wilson said she also hoped to take a trip, somewhere she can fulfill her dream of building wells overseas.",
