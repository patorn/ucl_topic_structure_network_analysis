  "body": "North Carolina officials have said they will defy a federal deadline to suspend their controversial \u201cbathroom bill\u201d by Monday or risk losing as much $4.8bn in government funding. \u201cThat deadline will come and go,\u201d said Tim Moore, the speaker of the state house of representatives. \u201cWe will take no action.\u201d He continued: \u201cObviously, we don\u2019t ever want to lose any money, but we\u2019re not going to get bullied by the Obama administration to take action prior to Monday\u2019s date. That\u2019s not how this works.\u201d But even as the state\u2019s Republicans stuck to their position on limiting bathroom access by birth gender, lawmakers also appeared to be offering conditional flexibility.  Moore said the legislative process would not work under a system \u201cwhere a response can be given by just a few days\u201d. He added that the body would \u201clook at what our options are at this point\u201d in his first substantive comments since the US Department of Justice letter demanding that violations of sex discrimination statutes implied in HB2 be addressed. Pat McCrory, the Republican governor, said he would review the directive before deciding on the state\u2019s next steps and that North Carolina would meet the Monday deadline to respond. But McCrory also indicated he would not immediately capitulate to the DoJ\u2019s demands.  \u201cThe Obama administration has not only staked out its position for North Carolina, but for all states, universities and most employers in the US,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cThe right and expectation of privacy in one of the most private areas of our personal lives is now in jeopardy.\u201d  Other state Republicans came forward to echo that position. Phil Berger, president pro tempore of the state senate, called the letter \u201ca gross overreach by the Obama justice department that deserves to be struck down in federal court\u201d. Legal experts say that if the state refuses to repeal or amend the legislation, the government could place the case in the hands of a federal judge and take steps to begin cutting off funds.  But it remains unclear if lawmakers are planning to defy the government entirely and miss Monday\u2019s deadline without further discussion or request for extension, or if this is a state-focused political play by lawmakers.  Carl Tobias, the Williams chair in law at the University of Richmond, said North Carolina\u2019s lawmakers were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d. \u201cThey seemed determined to miss the deadline, and they\u2019re not receptive. But they should at least be talking to the justice department to work out some kind of compromise, asking for an extension or saying let\u2019s talk. The justice department has been stern and to the point. So the real question is: what is North Carolina going to do?\u201d The conflict over transgender rights in North Carolina that began in February now threatens to cost the state billions both in lost business and the withholding of billions in federal government funds.  Legal experts say the key legal test is the case of Gavin Grimm, a 16-year-old transgender boy who teamed up with the ACLU to sue over his right to use bathrooms according to gender identity. The fourth US circuit court of appeals ruled that the student\u2019s right to use bathrooms corresponding to his or her gender identity is essentially protected. Because the court\u2019s jurisdiction covers North Carolina, the outcome of the Grimm case, which is now with a lower court, is key. But Tobias said it was still too early to consider HB2 and the battle over transgender rights as an echo of desegregation or Brown v Board of Education, more than half a century ago.  \u201cThis is not very much at all like that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have some isolated incidents. Most Republican governors are reluctant to go against federal government initiatives.\u201d But, he cautions, \u201cwe don\u2019t know yet exactly what Moore is saying\u201d. The North Carolina law limits legal protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and requires transgender people to use public bathrooms that conform to the sex on their birth certificate.",
