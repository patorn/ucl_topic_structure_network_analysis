  "body": "I sat opposite someone over dinner last week who offered me a wager that Nick Clegg would still become prime minister. It was an idea he embraced, and I rather agreed with him that Clegg would make an excellent one. I just find it hard to imagine the bundle of circumstances that would allow it to happen. I didn\u2019t take the bet. But I was fascinated by the conversation because it seemed to me to be the first hint of a phenomenon I had been expecting for some time: let\u2019s call it coalition nostalgia. You may not have felt warmly towards them at the time. But, in retrospect, there\u2019s a sense among some voters, and I certainly share it, of a fond memory for those days when the government \u2013 even if it wasn\u2019t exactly on your side \u2013 included checks and balances, and a feeling that some of them were wrestling with the future in an intelligent way. When the inner workings of government were more transparent.    if Thrasher and Rallings are right, then 16% would be a doubling of the Lib Dem vote share from last year    Personally, I have a particularly warm glow about 2010-11, when \u2013 just for a moment \u2013 thanks partly to the chaos of the banking crisis, everything briefly seemed possible. It didn\u2019t last, I know. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s what makes it possible to be nostalgic about it. A Lib Dem colleague of mine who was a special adviser confided the truth to me at the time. \u201cLabour isn\u2019t the enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even the Conservatives are the enemy; the Treasury is the enemy.\u201d And even if that particular battle was hardly won, it felt refreshing that it was being fought at all. I wish it was now. Now, Liberal Democrats are deeply optimistic people. That is why they hang on in there: the party\u2019s continuing existence is down to a branch of evolution known as \u201csurvival of the most optimistic\u201d. So there are again rising hopes in the Lib Dem camp that tomorrow\u2019s local elections will demonstrate something of a recovery. It is worth putting this into perspective. Michael Thrasher and Colin Rallings, the Plymouth University psephologists, have been predicting a Lib Dem vote share tomorrow of 16%. That would be twice the party\u2019s general election performance and would return them to their electoral appeal of around 2011 too (what was it about 2011?). The trouble is that the last time these particular seats were fought was 2012, when the Lib Dems attracted 15% of the vote.     \u2018Coalition nostalgia\u2019: Nick Clegg and David Cameron at their first coalition government press conference in May 2010. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images    The Lib Dem commentator Mark Pack also points out that Thrasher and Rallings have tended to overestimate the Lib Dem vote by about two percentage points. That would mean that those extra votes may well not translate into extra council seats. Let\u2019s also be clear about Liberal revivals. They date from the Torrington byelection in 1958 and have been reviving and retiring ever since. That was the year I was born, so I have been living my entire life during a slightly unreliable Liberal revival, which kinds of puts any revival into perspective too. They tend to rise when they win (which they haven\u2019t been, God knows). Or when there is a cause celebre that leaves them isolated and on the side of the public (which doesn\u2019t apply now), or when they unambiguously crusade on a cause that is their own. This last one is tough. For some time now, Lib Dems have been torn between the urge to appear safe, respectable and electable, and the equally urgent need for a clear and dominant purpose. These dominant purposes are, by definition, neither safe nor respectable.   Related: Why David Cameron may regret burying the Liberal Democrats | Rafael Behr    My guess is that, until they have developed something to say, which has to be distinctive, necessary and relevant to people (in their own estimation) \u2013 until they are clearer about what the party is for \u2013 then no amount of campaigning is going to kickstart that elusive revival again. But, hey, let\u2019s not be downhearted. Ideas take time, and Tim Farron hasn\u2019t even been leader for a year. I am a Liberal Democrat and therefore optimistic. Even if the Liberal beast slumbers on, there are recent signs of it stirring in its sleep \u2013 the occasional local byelection victory, the influx of members. And if Thrasher and Rallings are right, then 16% would be a doubling of their vote share from last year. It won\u2019t be a Liberal revival exactly, but it should be enough to remind the body politic that there is a Liberal beast sleeping, like King Arthur, waiting until its nation\u2019s hour of need.",
