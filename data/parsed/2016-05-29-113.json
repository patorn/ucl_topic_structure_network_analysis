  "body": "It is the childhood ambition for many a budding naturalist, bringing Fluffy the rabbit into the home complete with its own purpose-built hutch. But, according to the wildlife expert Chris Packham, the nation\u2019s pet rabbits are hopping mad about their wooden homes.  Delivering a withering assessment at this weekend\u2019s Hay literary festival of how we keep our pets, the BBC presenter said: \u201cWe don\u2019t revise our ideas about animal husbandry quick enough. Rabbits are kept in hutches because we were growing them for food, not keeping them as pets. \u201cSo if you\u2019re not going to eat your rabbit, why not give it a better quality of life and not cram it in to a hutch where it is going to defecate on to a huge pile of its own defecate. \u201cIt is not an ideal place, they need a place to run around. They are also highly social animals, they don\u2019t really enjoy being kept on their own.\u201d \u201cJust because they are rabbits doesn\u2019t mean we ought to neglect their welfare and focus on cats and dogs. We\u2019ve changed the way we keep cats and dogs ... well dogs any way. We don\u2019t allow them to foul the streets, some of us don\u2019t allow them to disturb ground nesting birds.\u201d     Chris Packham: \u2018Just because they are rabbits doesn\u2019t mean we ought to neglect their welfare and focus on cats and dogs.\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    He said society should be constantly rethinking how it looks after all animals, whether domestic or kept in a zoo. Packham was at Hay to talk about his new book, a coming-of-age memoir in which he charts the origins of his love of the natural world. A formative experience was eating tadpoles as a boy, something he encouraged others to repeat \u2013 in moderation \u2013 as it may instil a \u201cpassion for life\u201d. They do not, he said, taste of chicken. \u201cThey taste sort of gritty and they\u2019re difficult to bite because they slip on the tongue. The reason they are slightly moreish is because they are quite difficult to taste.\u201d Packham is about to begin the next live series of BBC2\u2019s Springwatch. While he would not be drawn on his views on the EU referendum, he did complain about the lack of debate about environmental and ecological issues. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that both the pros and the cons brigade are not talking about the environment at all. We\u2019re hearing a lot about the usual suspects, immigration, the economy and so forth but ... I\u2019ve not heard a single comment about the environment. \u201cEuropean legislation has a very positive impact when it comes to looking after the environment and species who live here, but also the Common Agricultural Policy has been nothing but a blight to the UK and farmers since we joined. All these things should be discussed.\u201d Packham is working on other projects but, he said, is still trying to persuade the BBC to agree with one of his current obsessions: that he should make a programme on tyrannosaurus rex, believing Jurassic Park got it wrong and the dinosaurs were feathered.",
