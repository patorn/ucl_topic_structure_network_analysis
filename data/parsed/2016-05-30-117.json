  "body": "A woman who was jailed for falsely retracting a true allegation of rape is to challenge the compensation awarded to her by a tribunal. The woman, known by the pseudonym Sarah, was sentenced to eight months in 2010 for perverting the course of justice, but she was released on appeal after serving two weeks. Ordering her early release, the most senior judge in England and Wales accepted that her husband had raped her in November 2009 after years of domestic violence. The lord chief justice acknowledged that she subsequently tried to retract the allegation after coming under pressure from her husband, only to change her mind again when the case against him was dropped and she was charged with perverting the course of justice. Sarah eventually won compensation for her ordeal, but her award was reduced by 70% because of the cost of the abandoned rape case and two minor driving convictions. On Tuesday she will appeal the reduction at the high court in London, arguing that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) had punished her unfairly. Rape victims can apply for financial compensation whether or not their attacker goes to jail. They CICA awards varying amounts according to the severity of injuries, from a basic payment of \u00a311,000 to a maximum of about \u00a344,000. The awards can be reduced or denied on the basis of having a minor conviction for smoking cannabis, a driving offence or shoplifting. Sarah\u2019s compensation was reduced on the grounds that she failed to cooperate with the police in attempting to bring her husband to justice and because of two unspent driving convictions received shortly after she was released from prison in a traumatised state. The deductions have been described by campaigners as \u201cmanifestly wrong\u201d, prejudiced and lacking compassion. Supporting Sarah\u2019s case in her submission to the appeals tribunal, the campaign group Women Against Rape (WAR) argues: \u201cPut simply, it flies in the face of natural justice to reduce an award for the life-changing crime of a pattern of rape and domestic violence on the grounds of two driving offences. Both offences were committed within a few months after being released from prison. [Sarah] should never have been put in prison, which is broadly agreed by both the Crown Prosecution Service [CPS] and police.\u201d The courts\u2019 treatment of Sarah led to a change in the way government lawyers deal with cases against women who withdraw rape claims, and an acknowledgement of failings\u201d in the handling of her case. Submissions for her judicial review against the CICA decision acknowledge that she would not have been imprisoned today, because of the significant policy changes the CPS instituted, partly as a result of her case. In her submissions to the CICA tribunal, Lisa Longstaff from WAR writes: \u201cThe Panel should have assessed her decision to retract by looking at how her behaviour was influenced by the domestic violence she had been living under, not by reducing her to a robot, but by recognising that her options and decisions were severely limited by her life experiences. By all accounts this a violent and controlling relationship; she had no keys, no purse, no driving licence. She was dependent on [her husband]. He was part of her family. As a mother, her concern for the safety, protection and wellbeing of the children will have been uppermost in her mind.\u201d Releasing Sarah from jail in 2010, Lord Judge, then the lord chief justice, said: \u201cThe sentencing court, when assessing culpability, should recognise and allow for the pressures to which the truthful complainant in such a relationship has been exposed, and should be guided by a broad measure of compassion for a woman who has already been victimised.\u201d In a police interview, Sarah said: \u201cThe only reason why I said I\u2019d lied and made it all up was because I had pressure put on me and I\u2019d been advised by somebody that if I said I was lying, I wouldn\u2019t be sent to prison because I am a single mum and I\u2019ve got 4 children. That\u2019s the reason why I said I was lying, because that\u2019s what I presumed would happen. I was told I would get a suspended sentence as they wouldn\u2019t put the kids in care.\u201d Following her release from prison, Sarah tried to clear her name in the appeal courts but failed to have her conviction quashed, leaving her with a serious criminal record while her husband was never convicted. Although she was released early from prison, she still had to serve a community sentence with a supervision order for a period of two years. Her lawyer, David Malone, who is acting pro bono, is in the process of trying to appeal against both her conviction and sentence at the European court of human rights.",
