  "body": "Sherry Sufi has resigned as Liberal candidate for the West Australian seat of Fremantle to stop his controversial comments from the past causing \u201cfurther distraction from the good work being done by the prime minister\u201d. A week ago, Chris Brown, the former Labor candidate, was disendorsed after it was revealed he had failed to disclose criminal convictions from the 1980s. Brown was swiftly replaced by Josh Wilson, an aide to the outgoing Labor MP Melissa Parke.  Sufi, 33, was absent from Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s flying visit to Perth on Monday, after reports he had misdescribed his work history on his application for preselection, warned that same-sex marriage could lead to polygamy, said the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people could lead to division, and criticised the 2008 apology to the stolen generations. Turnbull had waved aside questions about Sufi\u2019s absence at his Perth news conference, saying he hoped he was \u201cdoing a good door-knocking\u201d in Fremantle, which he said was \u201cvery character-building\u201d. He had also distanced himself from Sufi\u2019s comments. In a statement released on Friday, Sufi said he had resigned as a candidate and also from his position as head of the Liberal party of WA\u2019s policy committee.

This was never my intent. \u201cI am disappointed that I will not be seeing this campaign through, but I am putting the interests of the Liberal party first. I want to avoid further distraction from the good work being done by the prime minister and his Liberal team.\u201d    Here is the full statement on Sherry Sufi resigning as Liberal Fremantle candidate @abcnewsPerth pic.twitter.com/jKroWDKQyD\u2014 Jacob Kagi (@kagij) May 20, 2016    It is believed a 2013 incident, in which he was reported to have been caught on camera mocking the South African accent of the Liberal state MP and his then boss Michael Sutherland, might have contributed to Sufi\u2019s resignation. The details of his actions were reported in the Fremantle Herald on Friday. A replacement candidate has not been announced, but Pierrette Kelly, an aide to the WA Liberal senator Chris Back, had received the second-highest number of votes in preselection.  The Liberal party has taken a hammering in Fremantle \u2013 held by Labor on a margin of 4.8% \u2013 because of its handling of the proposed Perth Freight Link, the final route of which is yet to be resolved.

The Greens candidate Kate Davis, who took a sabbatical from her role as head of Tenancy WA to campaign, told Guardian Australia on the first day of the campaign that the electorate was looking for \u201can advocate with integrity\u201d. Davis is now the only original candidate of the three major parties still standing.  The Labor candidate for the seat of Moore, David Leith, also resigned this week over a 2015 Facebook post referring to Australia\u2019s offshore immigration detention camps as \u201cgulags\u201d. The post said refugees were held in detention for \u201cessentially political reasons\u201d, meaning Australia was \u201cpossibly the only state to hold civilians, including children, as political hostages\u201d. Moore, which covers Perth\u2019s outer northern suburbs, is held by the Liberal MP Ian Goodenough on a margin of 11.8%.",
