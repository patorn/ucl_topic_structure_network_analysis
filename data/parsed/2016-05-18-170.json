  "body": "Immaculate in a grey suit, Martin Creed strides towards me in the car park at Durslade Farm, home of Hauser & Wirth\u2019s Somerset gallery. He could be a businessman out on his lunch break on a spring day. Then I notice the spatters and whiplashes of paint all over his clothes, the splodges of colour on his plastic sandals. His hair looks a bit less of an Afro frizz than when I last saw him; now it is in a bun. His moustache makes me think he\u2019s been holed up with a bunch of outlaws. It is an arresting look that Creed, who is 48, carries off with panache. More than a look, it is a thing. In the video for his new single, Understanding, multiple Martins simultaneously fill the screen. He has a fringe, pigtails, all manner of fancy and often feminine hairdos and a disconcerting array of outfits. Wearing a woman\u2019s suit with a skirt, one of him bounces up and down and sings that he\u2019s a victim, and something about being stuck together like dogs. The video is joyous. Creed\u2019s new album, Thoughts Lined Up, is out in July.           Martin Creed\u2019s Understanding: the new single       \u2018It should be a few feet to the left\u2019 \u2026 Creed\u2019s new neon sign in New York. Photograph: Gavin Brown/Hauser & Wirth/Public Art Fund    This week, he is installing a show, What You Find, in Somerset. Next month his first New York retrospective opens in the 55,000 sq ft Drill Hall, the officers\u2019 rooms and bunkers of the Park Avenue Armory. He and his band will be doing a week of gigs as well. Understanding is also the title of a huge neon sign that has just been installed in Brooklyn Bridge Park, overlooking Manhattan. The word rotates atop a ziggurat. Was he happy with it? \u201cI thought it was in the wrong place. It should be a few feet to the left,\u201d he says, in his distinctive Glasgow accent. Creed is precise about how his work is shown. If he thought Manhattan should be swung round a bit to the right, he\u2019d ask. For an artist with so many deadlines, Creed looks relaxed, though much of the work for his Somerset show is incomplete. He is still making some of it in situ. \u201cI find installing stressful. It\u2019s like going on stage. The ultimate goal would be to make on stage and off stage the same, so you don\u2019t have to pretend that you\u2019re not nervous, that you don\u2019t have to pretend that you have all your ideas worked out.\u201d Vast canvases are being stretched, wall paintings are being finished, video booths erected in the barns. Local councillors and a youth group are coming to make a collective painting, each participant given a different colour. Tubs of expensive acrylic in every colour are lined up. Creed has painted several of the gallery windows with Jackson Pollock-like drooly flecks. The effect continues over his suit.     Have a go \u2026 collective painting at the new show Photograph: Hauser and Wirth     Related: Q&A: Martin Creed    One painting is going to traverse the space on pulleys, floating back and forth and bouncing like a ski-lift as it goes \u2013 Creed tells me that this is about the uncertainty artists have over where to hang their paintings. Three Fiat cars \u2013 a virulent green campervan, a boxy red 70s hatchback and a sleek, pale-blue Dino coupe \u2013 are lined up nearby. He sees these as being like paintings. Much of Creed\u2019s new show is going to be about category errors, about how art gets made from the stuff around you, and how it changes its meaning when it is in one place rather than another. It\u2019s not a new idea, of course \u2013 but for Creed it\u2019s personal. One room is filled with a disconnected jumble of audio equipment and speakers, through which he is going to play his collected voice memos. \u201cI make a lot of voice notes. A lot of them have ended up as songs or neon or word things. One was done on the tube and you can hear the announcer saying, \u2018There is a good service on all London underground lines.\u2019\u201d    Art is like body language \u2013 it\u2019s for other people to say what you are expressing    In a courtyard between the buildings, a few plastic supermarket carrier bags flap on the branches of a tree \u2013 Sainsbury\u2019s, Boots, Tesco. Eventually there are going to be about 50 bags. \u201cI thought the trees were the obvious way to hang them.\u201d He\u2019s got hundreds, scrunched up in bulging polythene sacks in one of the galleries. All come from Creed\u2019s flat in London\u2019s Barbican. \u201cI don\u2019t throw anything away. One of the ideas of the show was to try to make work out of things that I have kept over the years. What you think you are creating or making is not necessarily what you\u2019re really doing. It\u2019s like body language \u2013 it\u2019s for other people to say what you are expressing or doing. It\u2019s not a matter of being in control, really, but more like recognising that that\u2019s the way you are.\u201d     \u2018It\u2019s not a matter of being in control\u2019 ... Creed at Hauser and Wirth in Bruton. Photograph: Sam Frost for the Guardian    Creed once wrote a song called I Like Things, and has brought a lot of the stuff that he has accumulated to Somerset for the show: a dessicated bouquet, like a memento mori (given to him after his project for the 2012 London Olympics), and two broken chairs, which are currently lying flat on their backs. \u201cOne of them broke when I leaned back, the other was broken in a fit of rage. Then it was just kept, because \u2026 \u201d  He teeters into silence. I notice a bag filled with crumpled kitchen towels. Are they soiled, I ask, backing away slightly. \u201cNo, well, they\u2019re just used to dry hands. None of this is dirty, really.\u201d You don\u2019t come across jam jars of your own pee, that sort of thing, I wonder, back at your gaff? \u201cNo, no. This is a pile of stuff that was in the corner of my kitchen. I was going to make a corner sculpture. I\u2019ve brought some piles of things that I think are like sculptures made in the course of living, without trying to make them.\u201d     The cover for Creed\u2019s forthcoming album, Thoughts Lined Up. Photograph: Hugo Glendinning    All the sacks of stuff, I notice, are labelled (\u201cPlastic bags from under the fridge\u201d and so on). I have the alarming thought that he might want to take it all back and reassemble it at home. \u201cI really hope not. It\u2019s in case we wanted to group them again. With all this shite from my flat, I feel like I\u2019m stirring up dust, stirring up trouble.\u201d Maybe his girlfriend or his dealer was encouraging him to have a clear out, I suggest. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to live with stuff. I can\u2019t really tell the difference between what\u2019s the stuff and what isn\u2019t the stuff for this show.\u201d Then I notice the bags of human hair. \u201cI keep hair,\u201d says Creed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a methodical \u2018I\u2019m gonna keep all my hair\u2019 thing. I think I\u2019ll just try making a modest wee sculpture with it. I cut my own hair lately. I was growing it and then I decided I would try to do a video with loads of different hairstyles. We got a hair stylist in. I feel that most people would like to have different hair. \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing to accept yourself, to be able to live with yourself and the fucking shite that comes out of you,\u201d he says, helpfully. The first time he went to visit his family after growing a beard, everyone commented on it. \u201cI think a lot of people might take against someone because they\u2019re hairy.\u201d We agree that we both like women with moustaches, and I tell him he looks great in the woman\u2019s suit in the video. \u201cI can\u2019t help accumulating these clothes bought on eBay. I like buying ladies\u2019 jackets. I hate men\u2019s clothes. They\u2019re just big. The skirt is like a kilt, basically. Nothing wrong with wearing a skirt, anyway.\u201d Some of his new works are simple squares and lengths of cloth sewn with rows of buttons and buttonholes that can be worn in different ways and combined. They\u2019re going to be presented on mannequins.     \u2018I hate men\u2019s clothes\u2019 \u2026 Martin Creed. Photograph: Hugo Glendinning    Out on the lawn, he is erecting a big blue neon that says: \u201cCHEESE.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m totally afraid of cheese,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019ve got this expression, \u2018cheese thighs\u2019. If you watch someone eat cheese at a buffet, cheese and biscuits, crumbly cheese \u2013 people always eat crumbly cheese \u2013 they wipe their hands and get grease on their clothes.\u201d I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed, I tell him, checking my trousers for signs of cheese. \u201cEveryone does it without fail and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh no.\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a total phobia about meat. I am vegetarian. I hate the classic art world dinner where people are eating meat and then congratulating and hugging you, and then you have the meat fingers all over you.\u201d I ask if he has any other phobias he would like to tell me about. \u201cThere\u2019s a few others. There\u2019s lead. That\u2019s based on growing up: we were taught that lead was bad. If I have to go to an opening, or someone\u2019s house for dinner, I\u2019ll look it up on Google Earth to see if it\u2019s leaded. Any kind of lead roofing. Churches.\u201d Creed has been in psychoanalysis for more than 20 years, and his girlfriend, Anouchka Grose, is an analyst. She also plays in his band. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got their thing,\u2019 he says. \u201cI remember I went into the Hayward toilets when I was doing the show there. I\u2019d just seen some lead and I was washing my hands. There was a Muslim guy in there and he had a paper towel on the floor and he was washing his feet. I was thinking that we are just the same. I have got my religion, my rituals, or whatever, and you\u2019ve got your thing.\u201d You\u2019ve learned, as Slavoj \u017di\u017eek put it, to enjoy your symptom? \u201cThe worst thing you can do,\u201d he says, \u201cis hide the mess.\u201d \u2022 Martin Creed: What You Find is at Hauser and Wirth, Bruton, Somerset from 22 May until 11 September.",
