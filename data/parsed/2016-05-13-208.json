  "body": "Finally, 100 voters at the Windsor RSL have hauled the election out of the talking points and into the real issues. And the issues they wanted to talk about favoured Bill Shorten They even got some answers in a serious and civilised policy debate where both prime ministerial contenders performed confidently and well. But the tone and the content of many of the questions clearly favoured Labor\u2019s agenda: hostility to the banks, multinational tax avoiders, privatisation, housing affordability, education and concerns about health costs.    Related: Voters grill Turnbull and Shorten at first people's forum of election campaign \u2013 live    And the hangovers from Tony Abbott\u2019s 2014 budget were everywhere \u2013 in a question about the GP tax that has long since been abandoned in favour of the less obvious funding squeeze on government payments to doctors \u2013 and in the generally sullen mood about the performance of big business and the impacts on ordinary people of spending cuts. Turnbull, probably the more confident performer, kept circling back to his company tax cuts as the recipe for \u201cjobs and growth\u201d, but that wasn\u2019t what was firing up the room. Shorten\u2019s central message on education and fairness got a better reception, and Turnbull struggled to explain how less spending could deliver equivalent educational outcomes. When Turnbull chided Shorten for saying \u2013 in reference to his call for a banking royal commission \u2013 that the banks should be put \u201cin the docks\u201d, as if they were criminals, it was pretty clear the audience was firmly on Shorten\u2019s side, and possibly thought they should also be convicted. When the debate turned to negative gearing and each leader mounted their case \u2013 Shorten on housing affordability and the unfair nature of the current subsidies; Turnbull about the risks of rising rental prices \u2013 Turnbull seemed to lose the audience by talking about housing as an \u201casset class\u201d.  The debate even elicited some policy announcements \u2013 a rarity so far in the campaign.    Related: Bill Shorten wins audience vote at leaders' debate with Malcolm Turnbull    Turnbull announced a last-minute deal had been done on Friday afternoon with the pathology industry which meant the unpopular cuts to bulk-billing incentives \u2013 due to start on 1 July \u2013 have been put on hold. Just a few weeks ago health minister Sussan Ley said the pathologists\u2019 complaints were a \u201cscare campaign\u201d.  And Shorten indicated Labor was likely to redirect childcare subsidies to lower and middle income earners and reverse the freeze on Medicare payments to doctors. The voters in the marginal seat of Macquarie didn\u2019t ask anything about issues each party seems sure are a liability for the other \u2013 nothing on asylum seekers, nothing on climate change. They were focused on the central economic contest \u2013 the competing arguments about future prosperity being driven by company tax cuts, or by education and tackling inequality. And their inclination seemed to favour Labor. By the end of the more than hour-long discussion, 42 of the 100 voters declared they were \u201cmore likely\u201d to vote for Shorten. He now has seven more weeks to lock them in, and to convince them it\u2019s already time to change governments, again.",
