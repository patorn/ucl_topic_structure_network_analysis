Perhaps it\u2019s because singles began life as cynical, commerce-boosting products, and that legacy has lingered (\u201cThe new 7in record ensures you greater profit through faster turnover!\u201d crowed RCA, so romantically, at the format\u2019s launch in 1949). The album has long been seen as the ultimate expression of cleverness, too, forgetting that big ideas are often more powerful when they\u2019re conveyed in short, sharp shocks. As one suburban sage said \u2013 someone whom the Pet Shop Boys would cover \u2013 \u201cwe learned more from a three-minute record, baby, than we ever learned in school\u201d.   Related: Party conference: why the Pet Shop Boys are worthy of academic consideration    A shot from the dark, a lightning bolt, a rattle of the cage: a great single can feel like all of those, and the Pet Shop Boys know that. They have plenty of them in the tank, after all, and their new one, Twenty-something, is full of their trademarks: a nagging, electronic riff, a proper narrative, oceans of melancholy just around the corner, and that vocal of Neil Tennant\u2019s, unwithered by the years, simultaneously vulnerable and strong. The Pet Shop Boys\u2019 singles, at their best, are like perfect short stories, giving quick glimpses into lives, appearing then disappearing, but lingering bright and long in the mind. That\u2019s not to say their albums sag, although I\u2019ve loved some more than others and any band that\u2019s stuck to the one-word title for 20 albums \u2013 including compilations \u2013 deserves our applause). Their status as a singles band for me is confirmed from the framework they set with their first, though, the enduring masterpiece that is West End Girls. I\u2019ve written about this before for the Guardian, but it still staggers me every time I hear it: a compellingly strange fusion of very British things (a 31-year-old Englishman in a raincoat doing spoken-word, the influence of TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land) and American modernity (the starkness of film noir, the stark sounds of electro). From that point on, Pet Shop Boys saw the single as a world of possibility into which every influence could be poured and from which something incredible could be moulded and shined, an artefact for the ages. My childhood and adolescence was formed by this stuff. I knew from the Pets that a single could be educational, too. At nine, It\u2019s a Sin was a dramatic thing that gave me an idea of people having a past. At 10, Heart gave words and volume to the crushes I was feeling. At 11, I\u2019d read the words of Left to My Own Devices, pinking-sheared from the pages of Smash Hits, and wondered who could tell me who Che Guevera and Debussy were, although it almost didn\u2019t matter. I knew they were authorities in some field or other, and that they existed to the pulse of a disco beat: that was enough. There were worlds outside my knowledge, and worlds firmly within it, and the Pet Shop Boys told me I could bring them together to live happily side by side.

Take their mashing-up of U2\u2019s Where The Streets Have No Name and Boys Town Gang\u2019s version of Frankie Valli\u2019s Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You in 1991: their aim to turn \u201ca mythic rock song into a stomping disco record\u201d, as Tennant said on Discography\u2019s sleevenotes, showed how to skewer a certain genre\u2019s heavy smugness. Then there was the spark of Latin-flavoured colour that was 1996 No 8 hit, Se a Vida \u00e9, its video beginning with a quote from poet Rupert Brooke, its outlook transporting us far from the settling sludginess of Britpop. Or take 2004\u2019s Flamboyant, one of my all-time Pet Shop Boys favourites, which has a message that returns, rather boldly, in Twenty-something. \u201cYou live in a world of excess, where more is more and less is much less,\u201d Flamboyant begins, humour perfectly piercing the hubris. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been somewhat choosy, but you\u2019ll love her for the length of a good movie,\u201d Twenty-something responds, 12 years on, razor-sharp. Then come those oceans of melancholy, just around the corner again, that electronic riff, and that voice, vulnerable and strong. \u201cTake your smartphone and make your way home / On your own.\u201d In 2016, the Pet Shop Boys are still defiantly making singles about the young, and crafting them to get on to radio playlists (although, as Tennant told me in 2013, \u201cRadio people actually say to us now, \u2018Oh, we won\u2019t ever play your records, because you\u2019re too old.\u201d At 61 and 56, they remain oddly provocative, and that\u2019s the way things should be. Long may they keep giving us short, sharp shocks, perfect short stories, to linger long, for the ages.",
