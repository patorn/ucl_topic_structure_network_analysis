The Prohibition party got 270,000 votes in one presidential election, but that was in 1892. In 2012, the party made it on to the ballot in only one state and only 518 people voted for it. But this time will be different, Hedges says. The Prohibition party is hoping to be on the ballot in six states. \u201cIf I get a thousand votes in each of these six states I\u2019ll be happy,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cIt\u2019ll make us look like a going concern again.\u201d The Prohibition party was founded in 1869 and is the oldest third party in the US. For 137 years the core aim has been to ban the production and sale of alcohol in the US. Members got their wish in 1919, but prohibition was repealed in 1933, and there seems little hope of it returning. None of the contenders for the Republican or Democratic candidacy have prohibition as part of their platform. I\u2019ve arranged to meet Hedges, who served for 20 years in the United States Marine Band, at the Fulton County courthouse in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania. McConnellsburg is an hour\u2019s drive south-west of Harrisburg, about 20 miles north of the Maryland border.     Jim Hedges and Adam Gabbatt in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania. Photograph: Adam Gabbatt for the Guardian    We sit on a wooden bench outside the courthouse and Hedges, who turned 78 on 10 May, tells me about his campaign. He was selected as the Prohibition party\u2019s candidate last July. He admits to having had some trepidation about running for president \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m too old and too infirm. And I stutter\u201d \u2013 but is confident in his attributes. \u201cExperience in a variety of different things,\u201d he says when I ask him about his strengths. \u201cOrganisational experience. Not in a big organisation, but community groups. I was in the recycling committee and the friends of the library. And I\u2019ve been an officer in some of the town bands. It\u2019s not much compared to the party candidates, but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.\u201d    I\u2019ve been an officer in some of the town bands. It's not much compared to the party candidates, but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve done  Jim Hedges, Prohibition party leader     \u201cAnd you were town assessor, that was for the Prohibition party,\u201d says Carolyn Hedges, Hedges\u2019 wife (who has come along because she wanted to chat to an English person). \u201cOh yes, in my township,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cI was elected twice \u2013 two four-year terms \u2013 as the township tax assessor. But there were no other candidates.\u201d Hedges\u2019 spell as a tax assessor in the Thompson Township \u2013 population 1,098 \u2013 represents the only time a member of Prohibition party has held elected office since 1952. The party has been dwindling in size ever since the early 20th century \u2013 essentially ever since prohibition was passed. Hedges tells me there are currently about three dozen fee-paying members, who each contribute $10 a year. I originally heard him say as \u201c3,000\u201d, which made him burst into laughter.

Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock    An annual income of $360 is quite small for a national political party, but a trust set up in the 1930s helps to boost the coffers. Most of the money released for the 2016 election will be spent on gaining ballot access \u2013 they\u2019re already down for Arkansas, Colorado and Mississippi, and are hopeful of making the ballot in Iowa, Louisiana and New Jersey. Hedges won\u2019t be on the ballot in Pennsylvania \u2013 \u201cthird parties have a real tough time here\u201d \u2013 so he won\u2019t be able to vote for himself, but Prohibition party\u2019s 2016 campaign is headquartered here nonetheless. The nerve-centre is in McConnellsburg, specifically, in Hedges\u2019 wife\u2019s house. \u201cIn her dining room,\u201d he says. \u201cOr in my basement office. The current prohibition files and records are down there.\u201d From the dining room Hedges writes a monthly newsletter, which is posted to members\u2019 homes and online. This is the main campaigning effort, along with hoping that news organisations will cover his bid. Apart from attracting those 6,000 voters, Hedges\u2019 aim is to attract new members by modernizing the party. All the current members are over 50, many in their 70s and 80s, and many are ultra-conservative. It\u2019s not exactly a path to growth.     Hedges\u2019 newsletter. Photograph: Prohibition party    \u201cAfter prohibition was repealed, in \u201933, most of the support for the party came from religious conservative denominations, which had doctrinal positions against drinking, so we got a conservative reputation at that time,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to pull it back a little bit the other way. I can\u2019t do it all at once \u2013 politics is the art of the possible \u2013 but I\u2019ve got some progressive planks in this year\u2019s platform.\u201d The progressive planks include free college education and increased funding to combat climate change \u2013 Hedges is a committed environmentalist who built his own eco-friendly house \u2013 and which could potentially attract a younger crowd. The main pledge remains the banning of alcohol, however. Hedges comes from a family that didn\u2019t drink for religious reasons, and although he is a non-believer, he got involved with the Prohibition party in high school and has stuck with the lessons of his upbringing. \u201cI\u2019ve never so much as drunk a beer in my life,\u201d Hedges says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the damage it can cause.\u201d While he hasn\u2019t drunk a beer, alcohol has passed his lips. Via an unorthodox method. \u201cIf I\u2019m out socially with people who have a mixed drink I\u2019ll take a spoon and dip in it. And then lick the spoon to see what it tastes like. In that way I may have had an ounce of alcohol,\u201d Hedges says, in a revelation that I hope won\u2019t damage his election bid. \u201cI sort of like champagne. I\u2019ve never picked up a glass and drunk it, but I\u2019ve licked the spoon.\u201d If Hedges succeeds in winning 6,000 votes come November, maybe he\u2019ll have his spoon at the ready.  This article was amended on 26 May 2016. An earlier version incorrectly stated the year of the Prohibition party\u2019s founding. It was 1869, not 1879. The article also incorrectly stated the last time a member of the party held elected office. It was in 1952, not the 1920s.",
