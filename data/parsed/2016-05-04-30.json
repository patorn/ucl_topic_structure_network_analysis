  "body": "Paul Watson has seen things few would ever want to see. As a photographer he did not divert his gaze and turn away, but rather devoured the bleakest obscenities of war with his camera. In Somalia, most famously, he risked his life to capture the image of an American soldier\u2019s corpse being desecrated by a vengeful mob. Yet at Theater J in Washington there is something that Watson cannot face. Since his story was turned into an award-winning stage play in 2012, he has not been able to bring himself to read it or see it. When he does venture into a theatre it is always after the final curtain to answer audience questions, unaware of precisely what they have just seen. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about,\u201d the 56-year-old Canadian explains. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could survive listening to it.\u201d The Body of an American focuses on how Watson\u2019s life was changed by a photo he took during a disastrous American military intervention in Somalia in 1993, dramatised in the Hollywood movie Black Hawk Down. In July that year, a crowd had beaten four journalists to death. Most of the media then left, but the Toronto Star reporter and photographer was one of the few to stay behind. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up and I\u2019m a bit wiser than I was and I don\u2019t really like who I was then,\u201d he admits frankly, from Vancouver. \u201cI was reckless and I didn\u2019t give a shit about what happened, which is just not a healthy thing to say, but I knew something big was coming so I thought fuck it, I\u2019m staying.\u201d In October, during a 16-hour battle against Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, a US army Black Hawk helicopter was shot down. Watson discovered a gang cheering, dancing and dragging American staff sergeant William David Cleveland through the streets of Mogadishu. He recalls in a steady voice: \u201cI saw the body and the first thing I\u2019m thinking is, is he alive? Because he has rope bound by his wrists and also his ankle or leg, and they were tossing him back and forth like a marionette. I expected he would be stiff and he wasn\u2019t. \u201cEverything\u2019s moving very fast, obviously, but I had a brief expectation that I might see his eyes move or something. Then I thought, I need to take a picture and as I raised it [the camera], I heard a voice. We all know our inner voice and this sounded like a voice that was inside my head and outside my head at the same time, and it didn\u2019t sound like me. Amid all the muffled turmoil that had receded into the back of my mind, this was as clear as a bell. It just seemed otherworldly and it said: \u2018If you do this, I\u2019ll own you for ever.\u2019\u201d Watson, who has suffered depression and post-traumatic stress disorder after years of photographing war-zone victims, never received a psychiatric explanation that satisfied him. It remains a disquieting mystery to him. \u201cA bunch of soldiers wrote me letters, mostly hateful, but one wrote me a letter some years after the fact and he said, \u2018For what it\u2019s worth, I knew him and he wouldn\u2019t have used an expression like \u201cown you forever\u201d.\u2019 After reading that I thought well, I wouldn\u2019t use that expression, so wherever it came from, I don\u2019t know.\u201d     The play\u2019s producer, Dan O\u2019Brien, said: \u2018Journalists are trying to find the truth that often people don\u2019t want to hear or see.\u2019 Photograph: S Barouh    Watson says he did not hesitate to take the picture because, a week or so earlier, there had been another incident in which a dead American\u2019s body parts were paraded through the streets but which the Pentagon suppressed. He was determined that this time the truth must be told. He adds: \u201cWhen I heard that voice, I spoke without speaking because it was happening either in my mind or around me. I said: \u2018Please understand why I have to do this.\u2019 That was referenced to the September incident, that if I don\u2019t make a picture of you, they\u2019re going to deny what happened to you, and God knows what\u2019s happening to the others.\u201d The photo was indeed a wake-up call for public opinion in the US. The American military pulled out of Somalia in March 1994. Watson, who was born one-handed, won a Pulitzer prize for the image but was tormented by the knowledge that it would be last image of Cleveland that the soldier\u2019s family would ever see. In the years that followed he tried to make contact with Cleveland\u2019s family. He tracked down his mother to a trailer park and called her from a motel, leaving a message. \u201cThat night I got a call from her son, who I believe is in a totally different city, and he was livid. I recorded the conversation because I record things and I\u2019m glad I did because I couldn\u2019t process it as it was happening, but I listened to it over and over again and it\u2019s really an extraordinary conversation because at times he\u2019s just angry and I\u2019m sort of begging for forgiveness because that\u2019s all I want, for someone to say it\u2019s OK. \u201cAnd he kind of forgives me by saying \u2018You were just doing your job\u2019, which is really to me a knife in the heart. It\u2019s not forgiveness because I think I was doing something other than my job. That\u2019s not to sound grandiose. I wasn\u2019t there for a paycheque, I wasn\u2019t there to do anything other than to make sure the Pentagon didn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t happen, and I think that\u2019s something other than a job.\u201d The conversation with Cleveland\u2019s brother is recreated almost verbatim in The Body of an American, written by Dan O\u2019Brien, which has been performed to acclaim in cities including New York and London. It also depicts Watson trying to come to terms with a career of risk-taking in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Rwanda, Syria, South Africa and Iraq, where he was attacked by a mob. He has said he felt Cleveland was watching and that his death would have been \u201cpoetic justice\u201d. In the same year that Watson took his searing image in Somalia, Kevin Carter, a member of what was dubbed \u201cthe Bang-Bang Club\u201d of photographers chronicling township violence in 1990s South Africa, took a picture of a vulture watching a starving child in Sudan. It too won a Pulitzer. But shadowed by the horrors he witnessed during his brief but brilliant career, Carter killed himself the following year aged 33. Watson knows it could have been him. \u201cI was definitely close to killing myself a few times,\u201d he says. \u201cThis one time I was really over the edge. Two fortunate things: I didn\u2019t have a weapon to kill myself and I\u2019m not of the nature to kill myself violently; if I\u2019d had medicine or something I probably would have done it. I phoned my brother overseas and he talked me out of it.\u201d He continues: \u201cI hate even saying it now but it\u2019s true: I used to go to these places hoping somebody would kill me because I couldn\u2019t kill myself. I just didn\u2019t have the strength, I didn\u2019t have the courage to do it. I eventually found my way through all of that. I reached the stage where I thought I was pretty much dead anyway. You sort of reconcile yourself with the end and there\u2019s no need to kill yourself any more. It\u2019s coming at some point; I just hope it\u2019s fast.\u201d Watson, who has a 15-year-old son, quit the Toronto Star last year after a dispute with its editors. He is now writing a book. Asked if he has come to terms with that day in Mogadishu, he replies: \u201cIt\u2019s locked away in a place and I\u2019ve got it pretty tightly locked there. \u201cIt only really comes back when I talk about it, because it unlocks that door and it\u2019s all just very real. It takes me a long time to recover from it. The only reason to talk about it is the fact Dan made this incredible play.\u201d O\u2019Brien learned of his story when Watson wrote a memoir and gave an interview on America\u2019s National Public Radio (NPR) in 2007. The playwright and poet, based in Los Angeles, recalls: \u201cPart of what haunted me was I had a severe, and kind of mysterious to me, over-identification with him. There was something about his psychology, even about his voice. There was just something I really hyper-identified with in a way I\u2019ve never done before or since. \u201cJournalists are trying to find the truth that often people don\u2019t want to hear or see. That\u2019s very central to how I think about myself as an artist. Of course I\u2019ve never been to a combat zone. The most terrifying thing I can think of is the opening night of a play.\u201d O\u2019Brien made contact via email and, a couple years later, the men met in a hamlet in the Arctic and got to know each other over a week. This is also featured in the play, which shows O\u2019Brien, who has been estranged from his parents and most of his siblings for a decade, struggling with his own ghosts. \u201cI prefer ghosts to demons,\u201d the 42-year-old says. When writer and subject are due to field questions from a theatre audience, they usually go out for dinner and time their arrival for the final curtain. But one night they got there too early and waited in a dressing room, only to find the sound being piped in. Watson had to cover up his ears while O\u2019Brien scrambled for the volume control. O\u2019Brien, who has written poetry inspired by Watson and is currently working on a play about journalists in Syria, is far from insulted that his muse refuses to watch The Body of an American. \u201cI truly believe what he says, that it would be such a stress and a strain,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt would be a panic attack while he was watching it and who knows what it would do to his mental health for the coming weeks afterwards. So I don\u2019t have any great desire for him to see it. I think there\u2019s something kind of special we have in the trust that we have without him having actually seen or read it.\u201d  The Body of an American is playing at Theater J in Washington DC until 22 May.
