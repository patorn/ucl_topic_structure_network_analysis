  "body": "It\u2019s at once evocative, delicious and reassuring: the taste of my mother\u2019s homemade Iraqi pastries. Folded circles of aromatic, buttery dough that are popular across the Middle East, these bite-sized treats can be stuffed with dates or with crushed sugary nuts; there are fried savoury versions filled with spiced chickpeas or meats. But my favourite was always the cheese variety \u2013 served hot out of the oven, so that the filling is wonderfully gooey, the pastry still soft and fragrant, a small piece of Iraq giving comfort and sustenance throughout my childhood and beyond. Now aged 82 and dealing with some of the physical hindrances of later age, my Iraq-born mother, Maureen, recently told me that she could no longer bake the pastries \u2013 rolling and shaping them was too unwieldy. She has been making sambusak, along with various other Middle Eastern pastries, for some six decades, and so this information marked another closing, another limitation, another tear at one of many small things that all together make up a person, a personality, a life. It later occurred to me that bound up in my mother\u2019s statement was another one: that the family responsibility for pastries was being passed on to me, the only one of her three children with an abiding interest in making (as opposed to just eating) these fiddly, labour-intensive snacks. In truth, our shared interest in food more generally, and these pastries in particular, is a welcome pathway between my mother and me, something that narrows what might otherwise be a yawning gap. She grew up in Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, left for Israel in 1951, just after that nation\u2019s creation, and then moved again to the UK, where I was raised in the 1970s. All the differences contained in our divergent life experiences have at many times felt unbridgeable, in that way that is so often the case for migrant kids who end up as \u201cthird culture\u201d children: not culturally like their parents, nor like the country in which they now reside, but some new amalgam in between. Iraqi pastries are not the only subject to connect my mother and me, but there is something about the immediacy of this bond that is surprising in its warmth and durability. Perhaps that\u2019s why we both like to dwell there \u2013 how else to explain our capacity to talk endlessly, between us, on this same subject? We might focus a particular discussion on the Iraqi sambusak, discussing variations on the recipe or running through which carefully tested combination of the cheeses available in the UK are the best approximation of the ones used in Iraq. Then there\u2019s the matter of the hawayij spice mix that goes into the pastry, shop-bought in Iraq and in Israel (with its large population of Iraqi Jews), but mixed at home ever since. It\u2019s a combination of ground fennel seeds, fenugreek, mastic and mahlab \u2013 a fragrant spice obtained from the ground stone of the St Lucie cherry tree, cultivated for this purpose, and often used in Middle Eastern baking.     Rachel and her mother Maureen, in 1973.    Sometimes my mum and I roam into other treasured recipes that have passed from her kitchen to my own: baklava, malfouf \u2013 puff pastry fingers stuffed with almonds \u2013 or baba b\u2019tamar \u2013 date-filled pastries round garnished with sesame seeds. On other occasions, we might ponder the variations of Iraqi kleicha, dough biscuits often filled or rolled with a sweet date paste. I\u2019m very much a novice and so often check in on the particulars of any given recipe with my mother who, to my delight, seems happy to tap into her vast hinterland of pastry experience and offer advice. My pastry shortcomings, described over the phone or when I visit her, are met with thorough investigations to provide possible remedies: what kind of flour are you using? What type of oil? Are you kneading for long enough? Once these essential components are taken care of, she might then review the pastry aesthetics: how am I turning the edges? Am I folding them over twice, to create a piped edge? When I speak to Middle East food expert and writer Anissa Helou about these sweets and pastries, she explains why the experience goes beyond the culinary: \u201cIt\u2019s very much a part of the hospitality and a part of the culture,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about bringing people together to celebrate or to commemorate. They take a lot of effort\u00a0and carry a lot of memories. If your mother left Iraq during the days when she made sambusak, she will have all those memories bound up with the pastries.\u201d That is true, she does: my mum can easily recollect, for instance, making mounds of date, cheese, walnut or almond-filled sambusak as a teenager in Kirkuk, for the Jewish festival of Purim, when those pastries are traditionally served. She recalls a lull in pastry activity, when she first moved to Israel, aged 17, into the transit camps that awaited so many of the different Jewish communities arriving from across the Middle East during the early 1950s. And she recalls another pause in the pastries in the UK, during a period when work opportunities moved our family to the south-west of England, where some of the ingredients used to\u00a0flavour the dough were impossible to source.

Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian    Often, in the midst of one of our discussions about a particular type of Middle Eastern baking, it seems clear to me that something more than just the food is being passed between us, along with the pastries. Claudia Roden, a cookbook writer and cultural anthropologist, prefaces her recipe for sambusak in A New Book of Middle Eastern Food with a poem celebrating the pastries by Ishaq ibn Ibrahim of Mosul, which, she notes, was recited at a 10th-century banquet held by the Caliph Mustakfi of Baghdad. Researching her books and asking people for family recipes, Roden says she found that people were making particular foods as a way of remembering parents or grandparents. \u201cIn some cases they were making extraordinarily labour-intensive things,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they enjoyed making and eating those dishes because they meant so much.\u201d As cuisine is a carrier for identity, family, heritage and culture, Roden says that migrants often cling to recipes and dishes. \u201cFor people who are immigrants or who are wandering, it is about continuity, a way of keeping something of who you are, wherever you are.\u201d So for my mother, the diminishing capacity to make these pastries \u2013 a constant pursuit for her during many moves, through a string of homes and across several countries \u2013 may be tinged with a particular loss, a break in the chain that she resourcefully managed to maintain throughout. Mine don\u2019t taste as delicious as hers \u2013 how could they? \u2013 but perhaps these days, when I take my own home-baked Iraqi pastries to my mother, they might provide her with the reassurance and comfort with which her sambusak nourished me over so many years.",
