  "body": "A new name could be added to this year\u2019s notably open Derby next week, as Ed Dunlop is considering whether to supplement Red Verdon, who won in impressive style at Haydock on Saturday. The chestnut colt has been a handicapper to this point but is improving so rapidly that the Newmarket trainer feels he might not be out of place at Epsom a week on Saturday. \u201cHe will get a revised handicap mark tomorrow,\u201d Dunlop said on Monday. \u201cThat will probably determine what\u2019s going to happen next. But, yes, it [a Derby entry] has been discussed.\u201d   Related: Midterm ruled out of the Derby with a stress fracture of the pelvis    Perhaps the most obvious target for Red Verdon might be the King George V Handicap at Royal Ascot in the middle of next month but, having won easily off a mark of 88 on Saturday, he might now be rather high in the weights for that contest. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to be over 100, that will make it slightly tough,\u201d Dunlop said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a single entry just now, which is very poor by the trainer. If we\u2019re going to run him in the Derby or the French Derby or the King Edward VII [at Ascot], he will need to be supplemented. But these are nice problems to have. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to the owner today, who is on the other side of the world. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Red Verdon is so far below the Derby radar that he is not quoted for the race by bookmakers. Dunlop\u2019s last Derby runner, Red Galileo in 2014, carried the same blue and red colours of Ronald Arculli and ran on well to be fifth despite odds of 100-1. Dunlop has twice won the fillies\u2019 equivalent, the Oaks, with Ouija Board and Snow Fairy, the latter being another horse who put herself unexpectedly in contention by improving rapidly through the spring.",
