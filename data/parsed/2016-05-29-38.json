If\u00a0the Rev Adrian Alker (Letters, 28 May) has a problem with this then he should stop calling himself Rev and get a proper job.Richard SweatmanBristol \u2022 Re the articles about wealthy individuals and organisations using London homes purely as investments, what a good job it is that the Land Registry has not been privatised \u2013 yet. Otherwise this information may not have been so readily, or cheaply, available.Hazel AndersonAbergavenny, Monmouthshire \u2022 Jonathan Jones writes, \u201cIs that the Caravaggio diet \u2013 breastmilk for adults? It\u2019s almost mad enough to become fashionable\u201d (Feature, 28 May). I hate to break it to him, but adults have been drinking breastmilk for hundreds of years \u2013 it\u2019s just thatit\u2019s intended for baby cows, not baby humans.Sally MillerHorsham, West Sussex \u2022 Further to the correspondence about the proposed change of name of Titty Walker in the forthcoming adaptation of Arthur Ransome\u2019s Swallows and Amazons, in the 1962 BBC adaptation Susan George played Titty and the character\u2019s name was, indeed, bowdlerised to \u201cKitty\u201d (Letters, 27 May).Nick SpokesIlford, Essex \u2022 Roger being interpreted as meaning something other than someone\u2019s name (Letters, 28 May) rather depends on one\u2019s sensibilities. A memorable opening sequence of The Simpsons showed Bart writing repeatedly on a blackboard: \u201cPork\u00a0is not a verb.\u201dBill HawkesCanterbury  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
