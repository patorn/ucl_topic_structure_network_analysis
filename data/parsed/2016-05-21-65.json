  "body": "This venerable racecourse greeted with joy an unexpected Classic success for one of its most senior citizens as the 83-year-old Kevin Prendergast landed the Irish 2,000 Guineas with Awtaad. There was something opportunistic about this success, which came at the expense of Galileo Gold \u2013 unable to repeat his victory in the English equivalent on a much softer surface and after a modicum of trouble in running. Still, Awtaad won by a convincing margin of two and a half lengths, having charged up the middle of the track with some authority under Chris Hayes, who was landing a Group One for the first time since the Irish Leger of 2013. Some 20 lengths further back, Air Force Blue was as disappointing as he had been in Newmarket three weeks before, beating only one rival. \u201cAwtaad\u2019s always been a good horse from the time we got him,\u201d said Prendergast, who displayed a nice line in understatement in his post-race interviews. Asked where this would rank among the achievements of his 53-year career, he replied: \u201cI\u2019d say it wouldn\u2019t be too bad.\u201d When someone noted that he last won this race 40 years ago, the trainer responded cheerfully: \u201cIt\u2019s a long time. A lot of fellas weren\u2019t born!\u201d But the killer line, in relation to Awtaad, was no understatement: \u201cHe\u2019s as good a horse as I\u2019ve had, anyway, and I\u2019ve had Ardross,\u201d Prendergast said. Ardross, who joined Henry Cecil for his most productive seasons, twice won the Gold Cup at Ascot and was beaten a head in the Arc 34 years ago. Awtaad would not have Ardross-like stamina but may yet be asked to stretch himself out to a mile and a half in next month\u2019s Derby, for which he is already entered. Prendergast said all such decisions would be made by the owner, Sheikh Hamdan \u2013 but, on the face of it, Awtaad is a stronger candidate for mile races such as the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. That would mean a rematch with Galileo Gold whose trainer, Hugo Palmer, said in as many words that he would fancy his horse to turn around this form on a better surface at Ascot. \u201cThis is a proper-ground horse,\u201d he said. \u201cJessie Harrington said to me beforehand: \u2018The ground is heavy. Will your horse go on it?\u2019 I said: \u2018We\u2019ll find out.\u2019 \u201cWe found out. Frankie [Dettori] said he hated every yard of it. Every yard. The winner had first run but, on quicker ground, he would have picked him up.\u201d This was an unusually poor Irish Guineas for Aidan O\u2019Brien, who trained four of the eight runners and failed to get one in the first three. Air Force Blue would not have liked this ground but there must also be a suspicion that he has not trained on since his fine juvenile season. The way he pulled through the early stages here suggests he may now be returned to sprint distances.   Related: Derby beckons after Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Gurkha puts rivals to the sword    Perhaps surprisingly, that would have consequences for betting on the Derby. O\u2019Brien said here that if Air Force Blue ceased to be a miler, he would run The Gurkha in top-class mile races in his place, starting at Royal Ascot. That would take The Gurkha out of the Epsom race, for which he has been 9-2 favourite. His trainer has many other Derby options, led by US Army Ranger. Ireland\u2019s jump-racing champions were on winning form in France, where Willie Mullins trained a big-race double with Footpad and Un De Sceaux, both partnered by Ruby Walsh. Un De Sceaux bolted up by eight lengths in Auteuil\u2019s Prix La Barka, running over hurdles for the first time in two years. Second to Sprinter Sacre on his last two starts, at Cheltenham and Sandown this spring, Un De Sceaux hacked along happily in the front on this occasion and pulled effortlessly clear in the straight, with British-trained runners such as Ptit Zig, Aubusson and Al Ferof fading out of the places behind him. Representing his father, Patrick Mullins said the extra half-mile had helped Un De Sceaux, though he questioned whether the horse would be asked to go another half-mile in the French Champion Hurdle this summer. \u201cI\u2019d say softer ground and a step up in trip suited him. Two miles on soft ground, he\u2019s just not as quick as Sprinter Sacre. Now that\u2019s he settling better, we can probably step him up in trip and it opens more options for next year.\u201d The feature race in England ended in controversy when the well-backed and popular Mecca\u2019s Angel was beaten a neck in Haydock\u2019s Temple Stakes by Profitable, who leaned on her throughout the closing stages, carrying her from mid-track to the far rail. In mitigation, the winning distance was a neck and Profitable\u2019s jockey, Adam Kirby, made clear efforts to straighten him up, switching his whip hand in the closing stages. \u201cShe was nearly forced through the rail,\u201d complained Michael Dods, the trainer of Mecca\u2019s Angel. \u201cPaul [Mulrennan] had to snatch up a bit. If she\u2019d been beaten a head rather than a neck, we might have got it.\u201d The stewards ruled that the outcome had not been affected but gave Kirby a two-day ban for careless riding. The two horses may meet again in the King\u2019s Stand at Royal Ascot, though Mecca\u2019s Angel would need some cut in the ground in order to take her chance.",
