  "body": "Rex Tillerson, the boss of oil giant ExxonMobil, said cutting oil production was \u201cnot acceptable for humanity\u201d as he fought off shareholders\u2019 and activists\u2019 attempts to force the company to fully acknowledge the impact of climate change on the environment and Exxon\u2019s future profits. During a long and fractious annual meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, Tillerson, who serves as Exxon\u2019s chairman and chief executive, beat back several proposals to force the company to take more action on climate change. However, dissident shareholders won a vote that could make it easier for them to propose board candidates concerned about climate change and remove incumbent directors. Tillerson said Exxon had invested $7bn in green technology, but the science and technology had not yet achieved the breakthroughs needed to compete with fossil fuels. \u201cUntil we have those, just saying \u2018turn the taps off\u2019 is not acceptable to humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not.\u201d   Related: ExxonMobil tried to censor climate scientists to Congress during Bush era    Tillerson\u2019s presentation at the meeting showed that Exxon believes oil and gas will still provide about 60% of the world\u2019s energy demands by 2040, even if countries adopt climate change proposals agreed in Paris last year. His comments came after investors urged Exxon, the world\u2019s largest oil company, with a market value of $374bn (\u00a3254bn), to reduce carbon extraction or at least warn investors about how global governmental action against climate change could affect the viability of its fossil fuel assets. More than 38% of Exxon\u2019s investors rebelled against the company by voting for a proposal that would have required the company to publish an annual study of how its profits may be affected by public climate change policies, following the Paris climate agreement, to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2C (3.6F).  A similar vote at Chevron\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, also held on Wednesday, showed 41% support from Chevron investors that cast ballots.  Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church of England, who proposed the resolution, said he was delighted at the \u201cvery significant shareholder revolt on climate change\u201d.  \u201cConsidering the scale of this vote, we urge Exxon to sit down urgently with its investors to agree the reporting it will provide on the risk that climate change policy poses to its business. Following the Paris agreement, the time for climate risk reporting has well and truly arrived and the investor call for it is clear. It will not go away.\u201d Mason, who helps manage \u00a36.7bn of assets for the Church Commissioners for England, said it wasn\u2019t just the environment that was at risk, but also the billions of dollars invested in Exxon, if it does not adapt quickly to a changing world. \u201cThe financial risks of not acting are very real,\u201d he said.  Exxon had tried to block the resolution from being heard at its meeting, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulator ruled that it must include the resolution among Wednesday\u2019s votes.  \u201cGiven the significant resources Exxon spent fighting this proposal, such a strong vote is a real rebuke to company management,\u201d said Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas for Ceres, a coalition of sustainable investment groups. \u201cInvestors have sent a clear message that meaningful 2 degree stress testing is the new normal, and companies like Exxon and Chevron can no longer act as if nothing has changed.\u201d Tillerson, who was paid $23.4m last year, also suffered an investor backlash over his current position as both chairman and CEO. Some 38.8% of investors voted for a resolution asking that the company appoint an independent chairman when Tillerson stands down. He is due to retire before his 65th birthday, in March 2017.  Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement for Arjuna Capital, who proposed one of the motions, said: \u201cWhile the business plan of extracting as much carbon as possible was a winner last century, it will destroy value this century, and already has.\u201d The Guardian was banned from reporting from inside the meeting, and instead listened to proceedings via webcast. \u201cWe are denying your request because of the Guardian\u2019s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting, demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers,\u201d a spokesman said.",
