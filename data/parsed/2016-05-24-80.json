  "body": "Anna May Wong, the first of the few Chinese actors to gain Hollywood stardom, explained why she retired from the screen: \u201cI was so tired of the parts I had to play. Why is it that the screen Chinese is nearly always the villain? And so crude a villain \u2013 murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass. We are not like that. How should we be, with a civilisation that is so many times older than that of the west?\u201d Burt Kwouk, who has died aged 85, felt the same way but, as he remarked: \u201cI look at it this way \u2013 if I don\u2019t do it, someone else will. So why don\u2019t I go in, get some money and try to elevate it a bit, if I can?\u201d Kwouk, mostly seen in British films and TV, did manage to elevate many of his roles, finally transcending stereotypes such as his celebrated Cato, the foil to Peter Sellers\u2019 bungling Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies, to become a national treasure, this status being consecrated in 2002 by his joining the cast of the BBC\u2019s longest running sitcom, Last of the Summer Wine. Kwouk was born in Warrington, Lancashire, \u201cbecause my mother happened to be there at the time,\u201d but at 10 months old was taken back to the family home in Shanghai. There he remained until he was 17, when his well-off parents sent him to the US to study politics and economics. However, before he was able to graduate his parents lost all their money in the 1949 revolution, and he returned to Shanghai. A few years later, Kwouk took advantage of his dual nationality and returned to Britain, where he took various menial jobs before his girlfriend \u201cnagged me into acting\u201d. Capitalising on his oriental looks, he started getting roles mostly as villainous or comic Chinese or Japanese characters. One of his first TV appearances was a comic one, in a Hancock\u2019s Half Hour (1957), as a Japanese man presenting two bowls of rice to Tony Hancock, who has won a lifetime\u2019s supply in a newspaper competition. A year later, Kwouk was fortunate, so early in his career, to have one of his better film roles in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, set in China but shot in Wales. Kwouk, one of the few genuine Chinese people in the cast, played Li, who helps Ingrid Bergman, as the English Christian missionary Gladys Aylward, escape from the Japanese with 100 children. After a long and arduous journey, he is shot and killed by Japanese soldiers when he tries to distract them from the children. He was soon cast in a couple of Hammer Horror films, The Terror of the Tongs, as one of evil Christopher Lee\u2019s hatchet men, and Visa to Canton (both 1961). Kwouk was subsequently to play the sidekick of Lee\u2019s Fu Manchu in The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966), The Vengeance of Fu Manchu (1967) and The Castle of Fu Manchu (1969). But in The Fiendish Plot of Fu Manchu (1980), Sax Rohmer\u2019s master criminal was played by Sellers, with Kwouk as his manservant. It was a best-forgotten, dismal ending to Sellers\u2019 career, but it did give him and Kwouk a last chance to work together. Their first chance had come 16 years before in A Shot in the Dark (1964), the second of Blake Edwards\u2019s slapstick comedies featuring Sellers as the extraordinarily maladroit Inspector Clouseau, who seemed unable to cross a room without breaking something. Kwouk played Clouseau\u2019s Chinese \u201chouseboy\u201d, whose sole function was to ambush his master with kung fu attacks at the most unexpected moments from the most unsuspected places. These brilliantly choreographed running and jumping gags, which always resulted in the destruction of Clouseau\u2019s apartment and Cato coming off worst, were the highlights of all the Pink Panther films, which included The Return of the Pink Panther (1975), The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976) and The Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978). \u201cPeter and I fell about laughing so much that very often we were unable to complete the day\u2019s work as scheduled, which the producers hated,\u201d Kwouk recalled. \u201cCato and I are very different. He never stands still. I only move when I have to.\u201d The death of Sellers in 1980 didn\u2019t prevent Edwards from making The Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) by piecing together out-takes and clips from the previous films in the series. Kwouk was seen as Cato, bravely being interviewed about his boss, and again in Curse of the Pink Panther (1983), this time as proprietor of the Clouseau museum. Kwouk\u2019s protracted association with the Pink Panther series ended with Son of the Pink Panther (1993), in which, in various disguises, he attacks villains on behalf of Roberto Benigni in the title role. Kwouk also appeared in three James Bond movies: Goldfinger (1964), as a nuclear scientist sent to oversee the bomb that China has given to Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) to blow up Fort Knox, but who is later double-crossed and shot; Casino Royale (1967), as a Chinese general; and You Only Live Twice (1967), as one of Blofeld\u2019s gang of Spectre henchmen. His other roles varied from Chairman Peng of the People\u2019s Republic in Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) to a corrupt Laotian general who\u2019s hoping to save up enough money to buy a Holiday Inn in the US in Air America (1990), to the trustworthy contact in Paris of Jet Li\u2019s Chinese cop in the formulaic martial arts thriller Kiss of the Dragon (2001). Parallel to his film career, Kwouk made a niche for himself on British television in series including The Saint (1965-68), It Ain\u2019t Half Hot Mum (1977-78), Doctor Who (1982), and as himself in The Kenny Everett Show (1983-84) and The Harry Hill Show (1997-2000). But the role that revealed his underused talents as a dramatic actor was Major Yamauchi, the strict but honourable commandant of a women\u2019s POW camp in Tenko (1981-84). In contrast was his Mr Entwistle, a philosophical electrical handyman from Hull in Last of the Summer Wine, a part specially written for him by Roy Clarke. \u201cIt is a very pleasant and easygoing programme, a lovely gentle comic show,\u201d Kwouk remarked. \u201cThere is no one charging around, and even the slapstick is quite gentle \u2013 certainly more gentle than I am used to.\u201d Kwouk\u2019s voice was almost as famous as his face. It can be heard in the video game Fire Warrior, narrating the English version of the Japanese TV series The Water Margin (1976-78), the bizarre \u201cinteractive\u201d gambling show Banzai! (2001-04) and in many TV commercials. Kwouk was appointed OBE in 2011 for services to drama. He is survived by Caroline Tebbs, whom he married in 1961, and their son Christopher. \u2022 Burt Kwouk, actor, born 18 July 1930; died 24 May 2016",
