  "body": "Ryan Moore returned to his home-town track for the first time in two years on Friday and it was as if he had never been away. The best jockey in the business grew up in his father Gary\u2019s racing stable across the road from Brighton racecourse and honed his natural talent around its demanding twists and turns. He may be a rare visitor to the course these days but the lessons learned have not been forgotten. Monks Stand, Moore\u2019s ride in the opening novice stakes, was the 2-5 favourite but fell out of the stalls and then needed some encouragement to stay in touch as the field started to make the steep descent to the two-furlong marker. His jockey then decided to switch left and challenge between horses, giving Monks Stand no chance to think twice. With the decisive manoeuvre complete, the favourite stayed on well to give Moore his fifth winner from a dozen rides here over the last five years.   Related: Minding\u2019s 1,000 Guineas superiority prompts talk of gatecrashing Derby    Next week he may be called on to perform a similar exercise on another downland switchback but with rather more at stake than a first prize of \u00a32,911. Next Friday he hopes to ride Minding, the 1,000 Guineas winner, in the Oaks at Epsom and, 24 hours later, one of her stable companions in the Derby. But, in this most open of years, even Moore still does not know which one. \u201cIt\u2019s a very open Derby and there\u2019s a handful of horses that are going there with a great chance,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThey\u2019re unexposed and we\u2019re still learning about them. Usually you think you know what the star is but you have to hope that something will go and stamp himself on the race on the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of horses there that didn\u2019t have much exposure early on. They\u2019re all coming to themselves now and there\u2019s three or four that only had one run last year or didn\u2019t run at all last year and they\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d   Related: Derby favourite US Army Ranger just beats stablemate in Chester Vase    If the betting is a guide, Moore will be aboard US Army Ranger, currently 9-2 joint-favourite for the Derby alongside Wings Of Desire, who saw off Moore\u2019s mount Deauville by a neck in the Dante Stakes at York. Along with Deauville, Aidan O\u2019Brien expects to saddle Port Douglas, the runner-up behind US Army Ranger in the Chester Vase, and Idaho, third home in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown, as well and Moore says the decision is not as straightforward as it seems. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably work it out on Thursday morning,\u201d he said. \u201cAidan will talk to me during the week and we\u2019ll see what everyone agrees on really. I\u2019ll say my bit but we\u2019ll all come to the same conclusion in the end. It doesn\u2019t matter to me if it\u2019s an open race or not. Short-priced ones get beaten all the time. For a lot of horses it\u2019s the trip they get, the draw they get, what the ground is on the day. It all plays a part.\u201d Moore rides Brighton so well that it is a pity he visits so rarely these days, a point he underlined later on the card when Goldenfield, trainer by his father, took the 12-furlong handicap by six lengths. He is a dangerous rider with a soft lead at any track and here the former champion was able to choose every step of his route to an easy win. His fellow riders in a big field will make Moore\u2019s life a lot more difficult next weekend, though despite the open nature of this year\u2019s Derby and the imminent arrival of at least three supplementary entries, he does not anticipate a full field of 20. \u201cThere will be a decent-sized field for sure but I\u2019m not quite sure there will be 20,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the trial winners are running and Massaat [the 2,000 Guineas runner-up] has the best form but he\u2019s stepping up four furlongs and his dam was by [the sprinter] Acclamation. \u201cThat\u2019s why we just don\u2019t know about anything yet. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m riding. They are all so immature and there\u2019s horses bred for 12 furlongs that haven\u2019t even run at it yet.\u201d",
