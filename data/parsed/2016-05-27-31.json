  "body": "\u2022 A large picture of the Queen walking through the Palace of Westminster before the state opening of parliament (The big picture, 21 May, page 30) was lacking a photographer\u2019s credit. It was taken by Toby Melville for Reuters. In addition, the extended caption said that the Yeomen of the Guard was founded by Henry VIII; it was his father, Henry VII, who created the corps in 1485. The caption also described a Daniel Maclise painting as showing the Duke of Wellington meeting the Prussian \u201cField Marshall Blucher\u201d (we meant Field Marshal Bl\u00fccher) before the battle of Waterloo. As indicated in the painting\u2019s title, The Meeting of Wellington and Bl\u00fccher after the Battle of Waterloo, it shows the pair in the aftermath of the battle, surrounded by dead and wounded soldiers. \u2022 Because of a production error, an article in this Saturday\u2019s Weekend magazine (A\u00a0place of greater danger, page 44) about modern slavery in the Scottish Highlands, and the ordeal of Abul Azad, omits the word \u201cnot\u201d in a sentence that should read \u201cHe had not entered the UK illegally\u201d. \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Block nuisance calls on your mobile with a text Call to raise \u00a310m to buy famed Elizabeth I portrait for Britain Boston archaeologists unearth 19th century shipwreck under skyscraper site Stunning haute couture TV show recreates Nazi-occupied Paris \u2026 in Wales \u2018Eye-watering\u2019 scale of Black Death\u2019s impact on England revealed Why I give a hoot for competing dead jazz musician movies Benjamin: Dream of the Song; Lindberg: Era CD review \u2013 RCO explores new horizons",
