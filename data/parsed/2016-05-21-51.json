  "body": "Borussia Dortmund star Christian Pulisic will be given a chance to shine for USA this summer after coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann named the 17-year-old in his final 23-man squad for this year\u2019s Copa Centenario, which starts in two weeks but there was no place for the Seattle Sounders\u2019 in-form forward Jordan Morris. Klinsmann, whose side play Puerto Rico in a pre-tournament friendly on Sunday, announced places on his roster for veterans Tim Howard, Kyle Beckerman, Jermaine Jones and Clint Dempsey \u2013 but there was no room for New York City FC\u2019s Mix Diskerud or Morris. \u201cThis roster really was put together based on what we saw over the last year, and it\u2019s one that makes us the strongest team possible to compete in Copa Am\u00e9rica and to hopefully surprise a lot of people,\u201d said Klinsmann on Saturday. \u201cWe feel that these 23 going into the very special Copa Am\u00e9rica, they really deserved to be there. When you get down and you decide on the final 23-man roster, there are very close, tight decisions to make. The moment when you decide, it\u2019s about definitely who you feel the strongest about.\u201d   Related: Jozy Altidore to miss Copa Am\u00e9rica with hamstring injury    Klinsmann looks to have found his first-choice goalkeeper too. Howard, who played his final game for Everton last week before heading back to MLS with the Colorado Rapids, took a one-year international break after the 2014 World Cup, allowing Brad Guzan to stake his claim as No1. on Saturday, Klinsmann said the Aston Villa goalkeeper will start as first-choice: \u201cWe go into the tournament with Brad Guzan being the No1,\u201d said Klinsmann. \u201cWe believe that Brad deserves it. He had a very tough year with Aston Villa [who were relegated from the Premier League] ... but it\u2019s also a different environment [with the US national team]. \u201d \u201cThe manager makes the decisions, that\u2019s no different than any other time,\u201d Howard said this week. \u201cSo for me, I\u2019m not really that concerned with any decisions that are getting made. I don\u2019t make them, I can\u2019t concern myself with them.\u201d Klinsmann had brought 40 players into the preliminary squad, but was forced to cut the roster down to 23 before the the start of the tournament. Jozy Altidore was ruled out earlier this week with a hamstring injury. The 26-year-old has 34 goals in 93 international games but will not feature in the tournament, which celebrates 100 years of the Copa America. USA play against Colombia in the tournament opener on 3 June. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge bummer for all of us, but especially for Jozy, because he had so much drive and ambition going towards the Copa America,\u201d Klinsmann said in the week. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a big blow for us and him personally, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about it, unfortunately.\u201d USA kick off their campaign against Colombia at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara. They play Costa Rica in Chicago four days later, and round out the group against Paraguay in Philadelphia on 11 June.
