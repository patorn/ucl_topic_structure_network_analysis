  "body": "A principal dancer at the Royal Ballet has turned on a critic for repeatedly mentioning his ginger hair and fair skin in reviews. In an interview with the Times, Edward Watson, who turns 40 this month, said it was ridiculous that the critic, whom he did not name, continued to refer to his complexion and hair colour.   Related: Movers and shakers: the unmissable dance shows of summer 2016    The Times said the most likely target of Watson\u2019s ire was Alastair Macaulay of the New York Times, who has twice referred to Watson\u2019s \u201cpale skin\u201d and \u201cauburn hair\u201d in negative reviews. Macaulay responded by saying he liked \u201chair colours and skin colours of all kinds\u201d and \u201cenjoys mentioning them\u201d. Watson, who is starring as Leontes in Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s The Winter\u2019s Tale at the Royal Opera House in London, told the newspaper: \u201cThere\u2019s one particular twat who still writes, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s still there with his horrible ginger hair and his horrible pale skin\u2019 and you just think, is it really relevant to talk about someone\u2019s skin and hair in a review? I find that kind of ridiculous.     Watson, right with Tristan Dyer, in Woolf Works at the Royal Opera House. Photograph: Tristram Kenton    \u201cI think it was quite hard for a while for people to imagine me as like this kind of strong leading man with great looks and build and lots of dark hair,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m never going to be that. And once I gave in to thinking that I didn\u2019t have to look like someone else \u2013 I can do this looking like me and being me and people are going to give me the opportunity to get up there and do it \u2013 then I\u2019m not going to feel bad about it, although there are some people that like to make me feel bad about it.\u201d In a review of Watson\u2019s collaboration last year with Wendy Whelan, Whelan/Watson: Other Stories, Macaulay said Watson had a \u201cfreakish\u201d presence on stage. \u201cHis pale skin and auburn hair always make a theatrical impression; so does his fondness for hyperextension,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe is nonetheless a problematic, weak performer; his basic posture is awkward (he seems unsure about how to carry his head or his jaw), his rhythm and attack seldom excite, and his stage persona is freakish and overwrought.\u201d In 2013, Macaulay compared Watson to another principal in the Royal Ballet: \u201cMr Watson is the diametrical opposite of the fair-haired Rupert Pennefather (British), who, tall and long limbed, for several years seemed the company\u2019s most stylish male classicist.\u201d   Related: Jet\u00e9, pursued by a bear: dancing The Winter's Tale    Watson won particular acclaim for his interpretation of principal roles in the works of Kenneth MacMillan, including Crown Prince Rudolf, Romeo, Des Grieux, The Chosen One, and Woyzeck, according to his Royal Opera House profile.  Born in Bromley, Watson started ballet lessons with his twin sister at the age of three and joined the Royal Ballet school aged 11. He graduated into the Royal Ballet in 1994 and was promoted to first artist in 1998, soloist in 2000, first soloist in 2002 and principal in 2005. Macaulay told the Times that dancers should not read reviews of their work. He said: \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is Watson\u2019s vanity. He\u2019s had good reviews for years from many critics. Now he\u2019s staging tantrums because he wants all the critics to love him the same way. \u201cBut if you think he\u2019s really bothered about the pale skin and red hair, please do reassure him I think he\u2019s simply lovely when not dancing. And lovelier when neither reading reviews nor trying to manipulate them.  \u201cSince I\u2019m on record in the New York Times as admiring pale-skinned redheads from Moira Shearer and David Wall to Maria Calegari and Alexander Peters, can you clear up that Edward Watson\u2019s complaints cannot refer to me? I like hair colours and skin colours of all kinds and enjoy mentioning them. That\u2019s evident across all I\u2019ve written for over 38 years.\u201d",
