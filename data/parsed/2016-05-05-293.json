  "body": "The Liberal senator Bill Heffernan has warned an \u201cAsian facilitation culture\u201d is creeping into Australian politics made worse by the professionalisation of politics \u2013 a day after Tony Abbott revealed he was offered $5,000 in cash as a young MP. Heffernan also called for a standing federal independent commission against corruption, which could deal with all federal jurisdictions, including the judiciary, in his final week in parliament. On Wednesday Abbott said he was offered the cash in an envelope by a \u201cwell-known millionaire\u201d when he was a relatively new MP. He said Heffernan counselled him against taking the money and told him to get the donation made by cheque to the party. \u201cObviously it was the thing to do and Tony was very generous to acknowledge what happened and I have to say it\u2019s a particularly good bit of guidance for a young politician, which he was at the time, and obviously he was struggling with his home budget,\u201d Heffernan told Guardian Australia. \u201cI am not going to comment on how common [cash donations are] but some things are strikingly obvious and he disclosed that.   Related: Abbott: a 'well-known millionaire' offered me $5,000 when I was a new MP    \u201cI am across the Asian facilitation culture which makes it very difficult for people trading into there. You can get a signature only if you pay that bloke over there. \u201c[It\u2019s important] for us to not have that culture here, which is creeping into local government. It\u2019s becoming endemic with developers in local government and for young blokes getting on to councils who aspire to a further [political] career. The professionalisation of politics means you start at the local council level.\u201d Last year, the former Labor environment minister Peter Garrett said when he first entered politics he was offered an envelope containing \u201chundreds, if not thousands of dollars\u201d by Clubs NSW. But Garrett later retracted the claim, saying he had remembered the incident wrongly. Heffernan, who famously apologised for allegations he made against Justice Michael Kirby, again took up judicial misbehaviour on Thursday in one of his final Senate estimates committee hearings before he retires. He used the appearance to first call on the attorney general, George Brandis, to establish a federal judicial commission but Brandis rejected the concept because the federal judiciary was relatively small and there had been very few issues.  \u201cI have never seen any evidence of an endemic problem or significant problem in relation to the federal judiciary,\u201d Brandis said. Later in the afternoon, Heffernan returned to the committee to tell Brandis that a \u201cvery senior ex-judicial officer\u201d had rung on Thursday to tell him he was \u201cright on the money\u201d. Heffernan then urged Brandis to establish a federal anti-corruption commission. \u201cIf there is not a critical mass in the federal judicial system to justify a federal judicial commission, why not have a body \u2013 an Icac-type thing federally \u2013 which would embrace both the federal judicial issues and others?\u201d Senator Ian Macdonald disallowed the question. Brandis told the Senate earlier this year that the federal politics had been \u201cremarkably free of corruption\u201d. The impending July election has cut short a Senate select committee inquiry into establishing a federal anti-corruption body but its chair, the Palmer United senator Dio Wang, has said such a body would save governments millions of dollars and restore the public\u2019s confidence in politics. Independents Andrew Wilkie and Nick Xenophon supported a federal anti-corruption body with the best features of the state corruption bodies. The Greens have moved several motions in favour of one but the major parties oppose a standing body.    Related: Arthur Sinodinos 'under constant stress' over NSW Liberal donations revelations    Xenophon welcomed Abbott\u2019s comments for helping to expose the \u201cvexed nature\u201d of political donations. \u201cHis comments were very revealing and I commend him for making those comments because he has helped expose the vexed nature of these donations,\u201d Xenophon said. \u201cI would like to know who the millionaire was. It seems to be intended as an attempt to buy a pollie, where clearly Tony Abbott did ever the right thing.\u201d Xenophon, who is setting up his own political party, which is threatening government seats in South Australia, said he had rarely received \u201ccash donations\u201d. He said most of his campaign funding was coming from a bank loan for $100,000 which needed to be repaid with interest. Wilkie said cash donations were \u201cclearly\u201d going on and a federal anti-corruption body could investigate such allegations. \u201cIf someone gives cash to an MP, receipted as a donation, there is nothing untoward with that but it starts to smell improper when it\u2019s cash,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile $50 cash, receipted properly, would be understandable, $5,000 doesn\u2019t smell right. \u201cI do sense that it is clearly going on and clearly these aren\u2019t unique episodes because surely we haven\u2019t heard of the only two cases federally.\u201d Wilkie said a federal commission could oversee politicians and their staff, among others. \u201cThis is already illegal. For example, there are the federal police, the Australian Electoral Commission, we already have these bodies so the fact that it is presumably going on does suggest that it is an argument for some body to snoop around and check on allegations like this and even to follow them up.\u201d",
