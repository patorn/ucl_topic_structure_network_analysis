It is as sophisticated a summary as any I can conjure up. For those who believe in a society that isn\u2019t rigged in favour of a shamelessly self-enriching elite, the official EU referendum debate is a bleak political wasteland. On the one hand, a faction that believes in cuts, privatisation and policies that favour the wealthiest; on the other, a faction that believes in cuts, privatisation and policies that favour the wealthiest, with added xenophobia and dogwhistle racism.   Related: It ain\u2019t easy being a black Brexiteer | Dreda Say Mitchell    It is this extra poison that must now prove the clincher for another voice to be heard loudly and defiantly: vote remain to build a new, just Europe, and defeat a campaign increasingly dripping with naked prejudice and bigotry. A war between two Tory factions employing naked scaremongering unsurprisingly leaves much of the electorate cold. YouGov suggests that only 20% of Britons under 25 want to leave the European Union; among the over-65s it rises to 56%. But we know how this story can end. In the last general election, young Britons who made it to polling stations decisively plumped for Labour, but only about four in 10 voted; older Britons, however, not only opted overwhelmingly for the Tories over Labour, but nearly eight out of 10 turned out to vote. It could be a battle of turnout that decides this referendum. Voting for Britain\u2019s existing membership of the EU carries little enthusiasm; it is those who want to leave who are most fired up. That must change. The leave campaigns have become a threat to the country\u2019s social cohesion. For decades many of their figureheads have harboured an often zealous desire to leave the EU. They have gained frontline political experience and associated with prominent rightwing intellectuals and lobby groups. The idea of leaving makes their political hearts beat faster. Yet for all those years, all that passion, all that experience, they have no coherent, optimistic vision. It\u2019s as though the culmination of their political lives caught them on the hop. Revealing their total abandonment of any economic case, Leave.EU even issued a poster that read: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the economy, stupid. It\u2019s about sovereignty.\u201d But this bunch of charlatans have filled their ideas vacuum with inflammatory prejudice. Their campaign can now be boiled down, with not an ounce of misrepresentation, to: \u201cKeep out the dangerous foreigner.\u201d They are conjuring up demons that will not easily\u00a0be laid to rest, whatever the referendum result.     A Vote Leave campaign poster: \u2018The claim that Turkey is joining the EU is a straightforward lie.\u2019 Photograph: Vote Leave    Consider their strategy. Vote Leave \u2013 the official pro-Brexit campaign \u2013 issued a list of EU nationals who had\u00a0committed rapes and murders in Britain, tapping into prejudices that freedom of movement leaves us exposed to marauding foreigners. They\u00a0falsely claimed that Turkey is joining the EU (a straightforward lie), arguing that this would result in Britain being at the mercy of \u201cTurkish criminals\u201d. This week Leave.EU retweeted a video that included a representation of a woman draped in an EU flag being raped by dark-skinned migrants. But it gets worse. The BBC reported this week that Vote Leave will now focus all its fire on immigration. \u201cAppalled \u2026 Miserable & divisive if true,\u201d was the response of the Tory MP Sarah Wollaston \u2013 and she backs Brexit. The campaign believes its only chance of victory lies in voters, their pencils hovering over their ballot papers in the privacy of the polling booth, having fear of foreigners at the forefront of their minds. Superficially that calculation seems sound. Resentment of immigration is endemic in modern Britain. The official leave campaign would hope that people such as me dismiss all concerns about immigration as racist. I won\u2019t, and don\u2019t believe it to be true: there is a difference between having concerns about immigration, and being receptive to a campaign whose central objective is to demonise foreigners. Take Ukip, the mainstream party most associated with clamping down on migration: it is, according to repeated polling, both the least liked and most disliked of the main parties. A fixation with foreigners, and poisonous rhetoric stirring up fears of Romanians moving in as neighbours, has rendered Ukip toxic for much of the population, including people who have concerns over immigration.

I\u2019m backing Another Europe is Possible, which begins a tour of the country on Saturday. Rather than defending the status quo, this campaign wants to unite with people across the continent to build a just, democratic Europe that is run in the interests of the majority. It seeks to build on victories such as the derailing of the TTIP \u2013 the EU-US trade pact \u2013 as a result of Europe-wide popular pressure. It can draw on the rise of movements such as Podemos in Spain, which seeks to challenge the programme of cuts and privatisation being imposed throughout the continent. But a campaign based on bigotry must be defeated and its instigators humiliated. Take Zac Goldsmith\u2019s recent bid to become a Conservative mayor of London. He waged a campaign soaked in Islamophobia, and in doing so he helped to mobilise disgusted voters who otherwise may not have turned out, thus ensuring he was defeated. Goldsmith has been left a disgraced, shattered politician. His fate is now a template. Politicians and campaigns that seek to trade in migrant-bashing and stirring racism have to be routed. There are younger and left-leaning voters who currently won\u2019t vote, are sitting on the fence, or were even (like myself) tempted by Brexit \u2013 not least if David Cameron had negotiated away progressive aspects of the EU such as workers\u2019 rights. Yes, London and Britain are different places. But Vote Leave\u2019s strategy must be treated as a declaration of war. It has injected a new sense of urgency into the campaign \u2013 and its own bile must be used to mobilise voters who feel a combination of shame and disgust. At stake is no longer simply the EU. This bigoted campaign must be left broken and disgraced, just as another was in the capital city.",
