The record-breaking and critically acclaimed 2013 animated film tells of Princess Elsa\u2019s struggle to master her magical powers to reconnect with her sister Anna. It was widely construed as the studio\u2019s first foray into feminism because it eschewed a traditional happy-ever-after with a prince in favour of sisterly devotion.

But I can't deny its power | Martin Pengelly    Now Twitter users have called upon Disney to give Elsa a girlfriend in Frozen 2, which is currently in production. Alexis Isabel was the first to use the hashtag #GiveElsaAGirlfriend on Sunday, tagging the studio in her tweet. It has since been retweeted more than 1,500 times.

If the studio gives in to demand \u2013 and we\u2019re not likely to know, one way or another, until Frozen 2 is released \u2013 Elsa would be its first openly gay heroine. But some read same-sex attraction into the character the first time round, anyway.    I already thought Elsa was a lesbian, sooo... #GiveElsaAGirlfriend\u2014 A Princess (@KivaBay) May 1, 2016      #GiveElsaAGirlfriend because half of Frozen is one big metaphor for being in the closet, getting outed, and coming to terms with yourself...\u2014 Dana Addams (@TheDanaAddams) May 1, 2016    At the time of its release Frozen was construed by some conservative as to be a vehicle for the \u201cgay agenda\u201d, with a pastor denouncing it as \u201cvery evil\u201d on a Christian radio show in Colorado. This was prompted because of a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it cutaway to a father and children in a sauna \u2013 but the Frozen\u2019s takeaway message of self-acceptance were read by some as an analogy for coming out. Its Academy Award-winning theme song, Let It Go \u2013 tattooed on both the popular consciousness and that of any parents of young children in 2013 \u2013 was adopted as a LGBT anthem. Asked about a perceived undertone of homosexuality in the film, writer and co-director Jennifer Lee told the Big Issue, \u201cWe know what we made. But at the same time I feel like once we hand the film over, it belongs to the world, so I don\u2019t like to say anything, and let the fans talk. I think it\u2019s up to them.\u201d Frozen 2 was announced earlier this year, with both Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel confirmed to appear, and is slated for release before 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re not demanding speed,\u201d Robert Iger said in January. \u201cWe\u2019re demanding excellence.\u201d           Watch the trailer for Frozen Fever, the sequel to the hit Disney animation \u2013 video      Dreams really do come 2!!! #FROZEN2 #itsofficial pic.twitter.com/qF6qTQlnqi\u2014 Kristen Bell (@IMKristenBell) March 12, 2015    The original \u2013 which took two years to create \u2013 was an enormous success, ranking as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, and widely regarded to be Disney\u2019s best animated feature since its \u201crenaissance era\u201d from The Little Mermaid (1989) to Tarzan (1999).

A one-day academic conference, Symfrozium, was held at the University of East Anglia in May last year to discuss the film\u2019s impact. \u201cIt\u2019s such an interesting and productive text,\u201d said organiser Sarah Godfrey at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched it over and over, and there\u2019s still so much to say about it.\u201d",
