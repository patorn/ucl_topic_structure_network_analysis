On the face of it, the economic superpower that is the American consumer should be having a party. Low interest rates and unemployment rates, low oil prices, a high stock market, healthy property prices \u2013 nothing it would seem, to put off doing what comes most naturally to them \u2013 shopping. Yet they\u2019re stubbornly refusing to do it \u2013 or at least refusing to do it in predictable ways \u2013 leaving consumer experts to wonder, as fashion bible Women\u2019s Wear Daily recently did, if the consumer psyche, \u201cbombarded by digital messages, stressed financially and overwrought emotionally\u201d, has \u201cfinally exploded\u201d. Certainly, there\u2019s conflicted evidence to suggest it has. Retail stocks for Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Gap have all fallen sharply this year, with some reporting their worst comparable sales results since the Great Recession. Last week jeweler Tiffany\u2019s reported its sharpest drop in quarterly sales since the global financial crisis pushed the world to the brink in 2008. It\u2019s an international trend. In the UK, analysts are reporting 10% declines in the number of shopper visits to high streets and shopping centres around the country over the past year. In part, the shopping slump can still be blamed on the financial crisis. Consumers\u2019 incomes have not kept pace with household spending, and they are less confident about long-term economic stability. According to a recent Pew Charitable Trust survey, American household incomes fell between 2010 and 2013. Adults in the survey questioned \u201cwhether the American Dream is within reach, and many doubt that their children will fare any better than they have\u201d. Earnings for those at the top of the economic food chain have soared. Analysis by the AFL-CIO union found that chief executive officers of the top 500 companies took home on $12.4m on average \u2013 or 355 times what an average worker makes. Yet statistics show the same psychological hurdles to spending exist across income strata. At the high end of the US property market in New York and Miami a glut of residential developments and weak demand is triggering warnings that current pricing is unsustainable and future developments or commercial-to-residential conversions are being abandoned. In the art market, record sales are being achieved but against a backdrop of reduced demand and lower volume of sales than even a year ago. Executives spoke of \u201ctrepidation\u201d and going into sales holding the hands of prospective buyers. \u201cNo one wants to be the last person at the party,\u201d said Christie\u2019s Brett Gorvy. Beneath the economics, something else has changed. A contract has been broken. Researchers say neither consumers nor brands are getting much of what they want: consumers don\u2019t want to put their money with brands that don\u2019t speak to their values, while brands aren\u2019t seeing any loyalty from consumers they are trying to cultivate. The apparent contradiction between a healthy economy and unpredictable consumer spending leads some market analysts to the conclusion that consumption as an activity was fundamentally altered by the 2008 recession.

Photograph: Jack Sullivan/Alamy    The abrupt downturn shocked consumers but also placed them firmly in the driving seat when it came to making consumer choices. When you couple this with the power that technology has afforded them to research, learn and compare about their potential purchases, it is little wonder that consumer behavior is changing, analysts say. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to start looking at the consumer in a completely different way,\u201d says Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at Golden State University. \u201cWe can\u2019t evaluate their confidence and willingness to spend in the ways we used to,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cConsumers just don\u2019t react the way they did even five years ago. Technology has taken over and they feel more empowered.\u201d    Consumers just don\u2019t react the way they did even five years ago. Technology has taken over and they feel more empowered  Kit Yarrow, consumer psychologist     \u201cThe recession was the first step toward the complete shift in shopping,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cConsumers are more wary and self-protective about finances, and they\u2019ve never dominated the market the way they do today. They\u2019re informed and wary, and determined to be in control.\u201d The unpredictability has caused chaos for retailers, which have seen their power over consumers begin to slip away. \u201cTechnology means they can shop however and whenever they want, or they can shop all over the world, and that\u2019s why we see retailers collapsing and relying completely on price reductions,\u201d Yarrow said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking retailers forever to realise that when people go shopping they want to see new things all the time. This is what technology has done to our brains. We want a lot more excitement and product turnover in our lives. If we don\u2019t see new product, we won\u2019t go there any more.\u201d It\u2019s a trend being observed across the consumer market. The same conscientiousness that exists in the middle market has taken hold at the top end where luxury retailers could once count on injudicious spending to pump up the books.  Yarrow\u2019s research suggests even the one-percenters have adopted middle-class values. They feel guilty when they spend too much money, and quickly reject efforts to seduce them. \u201cIt\u2019s a demographic that\u2019s always been a little more entitled so patterns we\u2019re seeing in the middle of the market are more pronounced: if I don\u2019t get it how I want, when I want it, for the price I want it, I won\u2019t have it at all,\u201d she says. But there are other factors feeding into consumers\u2019 shattered psyches. For many consumers buying \u201cstuff\u201d just isn\u2019t what it used to be. People are looking toward more \u201cexperiential\u201d spending \u2013 holidays, concerts, plays \u2013 experiences that they can then share on social media.  Laurent Vernhes, co-founder and CEO of Tablethotels, a consumer website that specialises in high-end travel, told the Guardian \u201cthe more jaded you are the more you will seek experiential travel and beyond what you know.\u201d And it\u2019s not just holidaymakers \u2013 business people, too, want experiences. Instead of heading to the mall on Monday, post-recession consumers are more likely to start planning their next vacation or trying to bag tickets for Hamilton. The hangover from hard times and a technological shift in power have reordered consumer priorities. Consumers\u2019 psyches may be shattered but they don\u2019t want them put back together. \u201cThis is a much more conscious consumer,\u201d Yarrow says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go back to pre-2008. They want the power, and they want control.\u201d",
