Dressed in red boiler suits, groups of protesters crossed barbed wire fences to gain access to Ffos-y-fran mine near Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales. Some chained themselves to machinery, others lay across access roads.

Protest at Ffos-y-fran opencast mine in South Wales. https://t.co/5pUixRqhRI\u2014 steven morris (@stevenmorris20) May 3, 2016    The action in Wales marks the start of a global wave of direct action coordinated by the group Reclaim the Power supporting a transition away from fossil fuels in 13 countries including Germany, South Africa, Indonesia and North America over the next two weeks.  Following a weekend of planning, protesters entered the site shortly after dawn on Tuesday. They had widely publicised their action and there was a large police presence including thesouth Wales force\u2019s mounted section but no attempt was made to stop the demonstrators.  Within hours Reclaim the Power said it had brought operations at the mine to a standstill. Nine people, including an 80-year-old from Penarth and members of Christian Climate Action, were locked to each other, blocking road access to the mine.     #EndCoal stopping that machinery from going. pic.twitter.com/qNnOVjgm8d\u2014 Reclaim The Power (@reclaimthepower) May 3, 2016    Hannah Smith, on site at the action, said: \u201cToday we\u2019ve shut down the UK\u2019s largest coalmine because we must keep fossil fuels in the ground to stop catastrophic climate change.\u201d Explaining the significance of the vivid red clothing the protesters wore, she said: \u201cContinuing to dig up coal is a red line for the climate that we won\u2019t allow governments and corporations to cross. We are taking action in solidarity with the local community who have been battling Ffos-y-fran for nearly a decade, and now face the threat of a new mine next door.

Smith added: \u201cWith Wales going to the polls this Thursday and the climate crisis more urgent than ever, our action sends a bold signal that we must end coal now.\u201d Speaking from the heart of the mine, Sophie Stephens, a project manager from London, said the site felt \u201cquite formidable\u201d but said the atmosphere among protesters was good. She said some had played football and volleyball within the site. Workers had watched but not tried to step in as placards were strung between giant machines.  Among the activists outside the HQ of mine operator Miller Argent was Coralie Datta, from Leeds, who said the idea was to stop traffic going in and out. \u201cWe\u2019re not setting out to be arrested \u2013 we\u2019re just going to have a party here.\u201d     Protestor Coralie Datta on why she has joined the demo at Ffos-y-fran mine. https://t.co/Z6TQZvkQkI\u2014 steven morris (@stevenmorris20) May 3, 2016    Andrew Dey and Maya Williams, from London, were there with their six-month-old son Robin. Williams said: \u201cWe\u2019re showing solidarity with the local community, who have to live with this mine.\u201d Dey said: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to be here on a Welsh mountain but involved in a worldwide movement.\u201d     Ffos-y-fran mine protest  - young and old trying to halt work there today. pic.twitter.com/dGnJ5EDK2v\u2014 steven morris (@stevenmorris20) May 3, 2016    Louise Graham, from north-east England, was handing out felt roses with environment-friendly messages tagged on to them. \u201cI\u2019m a mother of two and this is a way of being engaged in the very important job of protecting our world,\u201d she said.

Alice Hooker-Stroud, leader of the Wales Green Party, said: \u201cWe are here to support the local community who are fighting against the devastating impacts of open cast mining in their local area. Fossil fuels must stay in the ground if we\u2019re to act responsibly on climate change. There is huge potential for renewables in Wales, creating a clean energy economy fit for the future.    awesome action taking place in ffos-y-fran to #endcoalnow with @natalieben @AliceGreenParty @Amelia_Womack pic.twitter.com/wNhP32WsN4\u2014 Wales Green Party (@WalesGreenParty) May 3, 2016    Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said: \u201cIf we are to meet commitments made in Paris to keep temperature rise below 1.5C we need to end fossil fuel extraction now. The UK government is failing to act to cut our carbon emissions, instead it is decimating the renewables industry, pursuing fracking and continuing the operation of opencast mines; the UK\u2019s climate change and energy policies are in crisis.\u201d Miller Argent declined to talk to the Guardian. A spokesman told the BBC that the discussion around climate change needed to be \u201cmore balanced\u201d. He said the miners were proud of the job they did, which included supporting the steel industry.

It aims to extract up to 11m tonnes in all. It says it has created \u201chigh quality jobs\u201d for more than 200 people \u2013 85% of whom live within 10 miles of the site. It has put forward plans to open a second mine nearby at Nant Llesg. Caerphilly county council rejected the application for the new mine but Miller Argent is seeking to overturn this decision.",
