  "body": "Zinedine Zidane said that not reaching the Champions League final would represent a \u201cfailure\u201d but still he smiled. At the club where the pressure can be suffocating and the demands impossible to meet, where everything is exaggerated and there is always a crisis around the corner, he transmits calm. Even when he is on the verge of a first final as Real Madrid coach, or alternatively the first failure of his managerial career, four months to the day since he took over; even when he is lamenting the loss of players who will not be there and warning those who will that \u201csuffering\u201d awaits. \u201cThis will be very, very, very difficult. It will not be like the last game against Wolfsburg: we won\u2019t score two goals in 15 minutes. We will suffer for 90 minutes ... or 120,\u201d Zidane said, a warning delivered in the same soft voice, with the same gentle smile, with which he responds to every question; the same smile with which he greeted even the most pointed of questions. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get through, will it be a failure?\u201d he was asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen you coach Real Madrid you imagine that you might go a long way in the Champions League,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy. Not because of what may happen [on Wednesday night] but because of what is happening day to day. That\u2019s what satisfies me. We want to get to the final, the players deserve it, but we have to work for it. And I\u2019ve always said that we\u2019ve achieved nothing yet. We\u2019re in a good moment, but it will be competitive. And, yes, it will be failure if we don\u2019t get there.\u201d   Related: Manchester City\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini: I knew Real Madrid would sack me    If that spoke of the demands, Zidane spoke too of the difficulties. The buildup to this game has been dominated by the muscular injury sustained by Cristiano Ronaldo, one that was picked up in the last minute of a game that was already won and one that provoked debates about the medical staff and the player\u2019s ambition to play every second. Zidane even admitted that he would like him to rest more but that it is \u201cnot easy\u201d to withdraw him. In Manchester, there was no choice; in Madrid, at least, the Champions League\u2019s top scorer will return. Zidane spoke just after Madrid\u2019s final session at Valdebebas. Ronaldo had taken part and the coach came upstairs with good news, but he also came with bad news. \u201cCristiano is fine, 100%. He will be there [on Wednesday night],\u201d he said. \u201cKarim [Benzema] and Casemiro are different. Karim had a scan and there\u2019s still a touch [of injury] and I don\u2019t want to take any risks. Casemiro is not an injury as such but there\u2019s swelling and I don\u2019t want to risk it.\u201d Asked if there was any risk with Ronaldo, Zidane replied: \u201cNone.\u201d Nor, he insisted, was this a miraculous overnight recovery; a precarious one, in other words. \u201cThis is not two days, it is a week,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cRonaldo recovers quickly, he looks after himself well. But this is not a matter of two days. It\u2019s good to have him. He makes the difference, his stats show that. I would have liked Case and Karim, too.\u201d Their absence raises questions about the lineup and the approach. Zidane insisted that the idea would remain the \u201csame, and all the more so at home\u201d, claiming: \u201cI\u2019m not going to change\u201d, but there may be a temptation to shift away from 4-3-3 towards 4-4-2. Madrid\u2019s 12th man lately has been Lucas V\u00e1zquez, but his natural role would be in the position occupied by Ronaldo or Gareth Bale, both of whom are fit. Borja Mayoral is the most natural No9 remaining, while Jes\u00e9 too could play up front although he is usually employed wider. Another alternative would be Ronaldo as a centre-forward, possibly alongside Bale, perhaps with a four-man midfield, certainly when defending, with Isco on the right and James Rodr\u00edguez on the left of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. Zidane nodded as the preamble to a question about Casemiro highlighted how the player provides balance and Zidane briefly shrugged when asked what the other options were. Asked what he planned to do, he said: \u201cYou\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u201d Although Mateo Kovacic could replace him, no one really does Casemiro\u2019s job; more likely is that Kroos plays a deeper role with which he has not always been comfortable. \u201cCasemiro is Casemiro but there are others who can do the same,\u201d Zidane said, adding: \u201cWell, not the same, but players who can do the job. The person there tomorrow will have the same ideas Casemiro does.\u201d If it is Kroos, he will have to defend more, Zidane agreed. \u201cYes, but not just Toni,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t have the ball we will all have to defend. It\u2019s not about just Toni. It\u2019s not just the midfield or just the defence; it is all of us. And we will have to try to keep the ball so that they can\u2019t attack us. I will prepare the same way as always: know the opponent, know where they can hurt you, and know what we can do. It\u2019s not the right time [to motivate them with rousing speeches]. They know what we\u2019re playing for. \u201cI hope we can produce 90 minutes of football like we played in the second half [in Manchester]. We have to think about pressing high, having the intensity you need in a semi-final, but we have to know we\u2019ll suffer. There will be difficult moments and we need to be calm, have patience. We can\u2019t think that because we\u2019re at home this will be easy. No. We know we have an opponent who will make it difficult for us. They\u2019re playing for a place in the final, too.\u201d",
