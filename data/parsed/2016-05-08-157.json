  "body": "Anyone who has already sat through the cumulative 257 minutes of Volumes 1 and 2 of Miguel Gomes\u2019s idiosyncratic portrait of contemporary Portugal (released in consecutive weeks last month) is unlikely to want to skip the third instalment. However, it is fair to say that this is the least essential of the three films. The narrator Scheherazade (Crista Alfaiate) is fleshed out as a character. Her adventure \u2013 a brief escape to an archipelago populated by outlaws \u2013 is a playful tangle of anachronisms. But charm dissipates with the final story, an overlong documentary-style portrait of a working-class bird-trapping community. Tonally, it\u2019s reminiscent of Raymond Depardon\u2019s glum portraits of French rural life, spiked with surreal flashes. If this was Scheherazade\u2019s final story, it would have been unlikely to stave off her execution.         Watch the trailer for the Arabian Nights trilogy.",
