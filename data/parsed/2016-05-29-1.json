  "body": "David Cameron is to appear alongside the new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, at the launch of a Britain Stronger in Europe battlebus on Monday, in an unusual act of reconciliation intended to underline the strong cross-party support for remain.   Brexit explained: voting by post or proxy   The two men will also launch a five-point remain pledge card highlighting benefits from EU membership that they say will be protected if Britain votes to remain in the EU. Khan was elected despite Cameron repeatedly using prime minister\u2019s questions to highlight Tory claims that he was too close to extremists \u2013 tactics widely condemned by senior Conservatives as unpleasant, counterproductive and racially offensive. But on Sunday, Khan said this would not stop him from appearing alongside the Conservative leader because making the case for continuing EU membership was so important. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday, Khan said: \u201cIs it in London\u2019s interest for me to hold grudges? Is it in London\u2019s interests for the mayor of London to be at permanent war with the Conservative prime minister? \u201cWe\u2019re never going to be best friends, but what is important is that the mayor of London argues the case for London and for Londoners to remain in the European Union. This debate is far more important than David Cameron or me. It\u2019s about our city\u2019s future and country\u2019s future.\u201d Cameron and Khan will unveil a pledge card that will be be distributed around the country in the name of Britain Stronger in Europe, which lists five things that will be guaranteed in the event of Britain voting to remain in the EU. The five promises are: full access to the EU\u2019s single market; workers\u2019 rights protected; keeping the European arrest warrant; a special status for the UK in Europe; and economic stability. Cameron will say: \u201cThese guarantees \u2013 from safeguarding our economy to protecting our security \u2013 show the positive case for remaining inside the EU. Whenever Leave campaigners are asked what Britain will look like outside the EU, all they can say is: \u2018we just don\u2019t know\u2019.  Cameron has already attended pro-EU campaign events with Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, and Tessa Jowell, the former Labour culture secretary, but a joint appearance with Khan \u2013 arguably the most powerful Labour politician in the UK \u2013 is an important coup. Labour supporters are much more inclined to vote to stay than Conservative supporters, and the remain campaign knows it has to mobilise the Labour vote if it wants to win on 23 June. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and Alan Johnson, chair of Labour In for Britain, have ruled out sharing a platform with Cameron, mindful that Labour\u2019s decision to campaign alongside the Tories in the Scottish independence referendum was subsequently cited as one reason why its vote collapsed in the 2015 general election. But Khan, whose links with Corbyn were highlighted prominently in Tory election leaflets during the mayoral campaign, is anxious to differentiate himself from his party leader, and a joint appearance with Cameron will boost his standing as a pluralist willing to work with a range of people in London\u2019s interests. In his Peston interview, Khan was also surprisingly positive about George Osborne, the chancellor, whom he has met since the mayoral election. \u201c[Osborne] understands why it\u2019s in the country\u2019s interests for London to do well,\u201d Khan said. \u201cHe cares about devolving power away from Whitehall, and to give him credit he\u2019s given more power to SNP Scotland, more power to Labour Wales, more power to a Labour Greater Manchester, and I believe genuinely he\u2019ll give more power to London as well.\u201d In a separate development on Sunday, Vote Leave claimed that leaving the EU would enable a UK government to tackle the problem posed by wealthy foreign investors buying up London property and leaving it empty. Citing figures highlighted by the Guardian showing that almost 100,000 properties in England and Wales are owned by offshore companies, a Vote Leave briefing said European court of justice rulings stop EU member states imposing residence requirements on property ownership on the grounds that this would amount to interference with the principle of free movement of capital. Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit justice secretary, said: \u201cAt the moment we are powerless to stop offshore companies buying property in the UK because of EU rules. This drives up the cost of housing, which is fast becoming unaffordable for all but the super-rich. \u201cIf we vote leave and take back control we would be able to introduce curbs that would help British families to get on the housing ladder.\u201d",
