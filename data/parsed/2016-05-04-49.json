Related: What will Hollywood make of Leicester\u2019s spellbinding season? | Marina Hyde    In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Renata Ranieri revealed that she had burst into tears when Eden Hazard\u2019s equaliser for Chelsea against Tottenham at Stamford Bridge ensured Leicester had won their first league title. While the entire team assembled at Jamie Vardy\u2019s house to watch the Chelsea match on Monday, Ranieri flew to Rome for lunch with his 96-year-old mother before returning to England. \u201cWe had some steak with chicory. Before leaving, he ate strawberries with lemon and sugar,\u201d Renata said. \u201cMy son has to keep himself in shape, so he rarely asks for a starter. He talked about Leicester a bit, but wanted to relax. He was with me for two hours, then said the president of his team had organised a plane to take him back to England. We said goodbye and he went towards the Ciampino airport.\u201d She added: \u201cAt the final whistle I burst into tears. I only heard from Claudio later because first my grandchildren and my son\u2019s cousins called. He was so happy. We all are. Now we can finally relax. \u201cI watched every game, it was a continual series of emotions. He calls me every evening and kept me up to date on everything. This morning I bought the sports papers and saw the headlines. It was satisfying. \u201cI have to admit, I did not expect him to win with Leicester. He found these players \u2026 they are good lads. He told me they always trained as real professionals. \u201cNaturally it wasn\u2019t a big squad full of champions. I know that he\u2019s happy in England, they always treated him perfectly. He rediscovered himself there.\u201d Ranieri spent 18 months at his hometown club, Roma, but resigned in February 2011 after falling out with club officials. Renata believes success in England has allowed her son to finally put that disappointment behind him. \u201cIn my view, at Roma he was not treated with respect. In the family we are all Giallorossi fans, so when Claudio was there we were also guests at Trigoria [the training ground],\u201d she said. \u201cWe were disappointed with the way things ended. Look, he won his own scudetto here too, because he went really close, but he arrived after the season had already started. Now he\u2019s \u2018King of England\u2019, imagine that.\u201d",
