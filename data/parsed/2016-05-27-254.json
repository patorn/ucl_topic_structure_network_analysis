An electric typewriter that promises digital connectivity without the distractions, Freewrite has largely been dismissed by the tech press. Even the pop culture mavens of Mashable denounced it as \u201cpretentious hipster nonsense\u201d, excoriating its weight (four pounds), diminutive screen (5.5in) and hefty price tag ($499).  But maybe things would be different in a quiet Brooklyn cafe. For all I knew, tattooed forearms all over the neighbourhood were already pounding Freewrites with onanistic zeal, man buns a-quiver as the next generation of Great American Narcissists clattered towards notoriety in a cortado-fuelled frenzy \u2013 less Infinite Jest than Infinite Monkey Theorem. Not in my neighbourhood cafe though, where the only sounds were Dave Brubeck, the Darth-Vadering of the coffee machine and my own apologetic tapping. So I\u2019d avoided hipster shame but already forked out $499 for this machine. Would it be worth it for a distraction-free writing session?  Distraction isn\u2019t a new problem, but when people started writing on computers \u2013 and those computers became connected to the internet \u2013 distraction became a billion-dollar game. The dominant business model on the internet is this: we\u2019ll give you free stuff if you give us your attention. Ad-blockers won\u2019t save you. Trending topics are by definition the \u201cclickiest\u201d ones. And the content in your newsfeeds is painstakingly tweaked to your interests, your location and even your mood.    Boredom is the optimal state for the writer, scientist or philosopher \u2013 and the web is hell-bent on eradicating it    And so it takes Odyssean displays of fortitude to get anything done. So could we head off these self-destructive urges not just with Wi-Fi blockers (which only defer the problem), but by changing our writing habits entirely? Freewrite has a Grayscale screen. No browser. It\u2019s bo-ring \u2013 and that\u2019s precisely the point. A century ago, philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote: \u201cWe are less bored than our ancestors were, but we are more afraid of boredom\u201d \u2013 and that was before the web was even a twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s eye. Boredom is the crucible of creative thought. Philosopher Walter Benjamin thought that it was \u201cthe apogee of mental relaxation\u201d; for Kierkegaard, idleness made one into a \u201cmeticulous observer\u201d. Boredom is the optimal state for the writer, the scientist or the philosopher \u2013 and the web is hell-bent on eradicating it. First drafts are especially vulnerable to disruption. As I churned out the initial version of this piece on my Freewrite (outdoors, thanks to the e-ink screen), I couldn\u2019t unthinkingly open a browser window whenever I got stuck. But unlike the internet, staring at the sky gets tedious pretty quickly. So I got back to work. Searching for a connected device would have required a decision that my rational self balked at endorsing. If enjoying a boost in productivity makes me a hipster douchebag, then stick a bird on me, because I\u2019m, like, super down. The Freewrite\u2019s screensaver promises that writing without editing (there\u2019s no cursor or arrow keys) will help you to \u201cset your story free\u201d. It\u2019s meant as encouragement, but it reads as a dare. Writer George Saunders recounts how he and his fellow students reacted with terror when asked to tell an off-the-cuff tale. \u201cWe don\u2019t know any good, real stories,\u201d he explains, \u201cwhich is why we have been writing all of these stories about kids having sex with crocodiles and so forth.\u201d If even the fiction writers are struggling, surely there\u2019s no hope for the rest of us. Walter Benjamin argued that the newspaper\u2019s daily barrage of fragmentary information was killing the art of storytelling. But now reading is dying, too. Blasted by the fire hose of our daily feeds, we click on a headline and read two paragraphs before leaving the piece behind like a half-eaten sandwich. We\u2019re not even reading stories properly: it\u2019s no wonder we can\u2019t tell them. If the world is becoming more connected, what is the nature of the connection? What if we don\u2019t just need a bigger fire hose? If the web of the future is to foster the attentive presence and meaningful communication that storytelling has cultivated for millennia, insulating story creation from the informational deluge makes sense. The Freewrite isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s an interesting start. The Freewrite might still turn out to be the most expensive paperweight I ever bought. Time will tell. But for now, I\u2019m glad to be the pretentious possessor of not just another bovine \u201csmart\u201d device, but some truly thoughtful tech.",
