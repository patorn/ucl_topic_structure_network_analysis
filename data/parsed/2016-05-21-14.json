You\u2019re as sexist as your ghastly, dinosaur-ridden golf club,\u201d said the former editor of the News of the World. For a moment I was almost about to cheer the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers for standing up for their principles. Happily, the moment soon passed. Muirfield in East Lothian says it is home to the world\u2019s oldest golf club, although Royal Burgess just down the road has also laid claim to that title. Muirfield\u2019s decision last Thursday not to amend the constitution of the club to permit women members was the result of a secret ballot of 616 members in which 397 of them voted for change and 219 opted for the status quo. The pro-women lobby had required a two-thirds majority but had fallen 14 votes short. Universal condemnation ensued and reprisals were swift. The Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, which administers the game throughout most of the world, immediately removed Muirfield from its roster of courses deemed good enough to host the Open championship. Royal Troon, another male-only club is expected to suffer a similar fate if it too denies women the right to full membership. Much of the condemnation throughout Scotland has been a long time coming. Until very recently a pattern of discrimination underpinned membership of Scotland\u2019s finest golf clubs and was accepted with a sigh and a shrug. \u201cOh well, you know, what can we do it\u2019s just a bunch of pish-stained old buffers and blazered buffoons hanging on to a passing way of life.\u201d The R&A itself only accepted women as equal members just under two years ago after being embarrassed into action by Alex Salmond. Scotland\u2019s former first minister, a keen golfer, publicly rejected an invitation to attend the Open the last time it was held at Muirfield in 2013. For many golfers, social exclusion founded on an almost comical sense of elitism, are important reasons for wanting to join a golf club. What would be the point of waiting for years to have your membership accepted and then discovering that the sods let anyone join? Glasgow\u2019s Jewish community had to build its own course on the south of the city because few of them were ever accepted as members. Until recently, some of these same clubs also discriminated against Catholics. In these places a certain type of chap, perhaps not getting things all his own way at work or feeling inadequate in his relationships with women, feels that by putting on a silly blazer and sitting in leather armchairs with other chaps he can restore his lost manliness.   Related: Muirfield loses right to hold Open after voting to remain men-only    There has been some sympathy for the Muirfield members. It\u2019s a private club, built on its own land and not in receipt of public money. Many of those members who voted to exclude women are probably not sexist and do not treat women as second-class citizens. A degree of resentment at the influence of outsiders with a dubious agenda will have partly informed their decision. And what do we have to say about the existence of some all-women golf clubs and all-women gyms? It\u2019s not really the same, though. Golf has become one of the cornerstones of tourism in Scotland and our championship golf courses are not simply vital to the economy; they are sources of national pride. That several of them didn\u2019t just exclude women but took pride in doing so made a mockery of successive Scottish governments\u2019 messages of fairness and equality in their cultural and social agendas. If it was known that Muirfield\u2019s constitution also included clauses discriminating against black people, gay people, Muslims or Catholics a way would have been found long before now to have it shut down. There has been a sharp increase in the numbers of women seeking to play golf as a pastime and as professionals. What do we say to them? Melissa Reid, the British golfer who plays on the European Women\u2019s Tour, expressed this eloquently in the Times on Friday: \u201cThe history of women\u2019s golf is one of overcoming challenges in so many circumstances, but just when you think you are becoming equal you are faced with something like this. An opportunity has been lost.\u201d The membership of Muirfield is made up of some of the most influential members of Scottish society. You\u2019ll find judges, lawyers, police chiefs, senior physicians and entrepreneurs among its membership. The extent to which they carry their attitudes about women into their places of work ought to trouble us all. In time, Muirfield will probably have another vote and by then the passing of another few years will have diluted opposition to women and lead to change. In the meantime, the Scottish government and local authorities could make life uncomfortable for the members of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. Companies which bid for public sector contracts are penalised if they don\u2019t pay the Living Wage and are also expected to have signed up to minimum standards of fairness, equality and inclusiveness. Those deemed to have discriminatory practices are marked down. If any of their directors were known to be members of Muirfield or Royal Troon or any other club which discriminates against women they could be similarly sanctioned. I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath. Elitism, unearned privilege and discrimination are still rampant in Scottish society from land ownership to the tiny favoured few with the right sort of education and family connections who run our judiciary and our civil service. Women in Scotland are still paid significantly less than their male counterparts and find it much more difficult to gain directorships in business. They are still woefully under-represented in parliament. On average women in Scotland earn \u00a3175.30 per week less than men. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings which compiled these statistics says \u201cthere are a few extremely high earning staff, most of whom are men, and many women are clustered in the lowest paid professions\u201d. Giving the Muirfield members a right good kicking won\u2019t significantly alter this. In permitting such anti-women attitudes in these clubs to exist for generations though, it\u2019s not difficult to see why gross inequality in the workplace still exists.",
