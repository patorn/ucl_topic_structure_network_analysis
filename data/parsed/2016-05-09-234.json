  "body": "Like so many people I have unwisely loved, Barack Hussein Obama intrigues and infuriates and enrages and inspires and uplifts and disappoints me all at once. And whether it is politically or psychologically healthy to do so, I have loved President Obama, even as I have known that it\u2019s not healthy and as I have wanted to maintain a certain critical distance since becoming a journalist. But before I wrote for a living, I gave up a few months of my life in 2008 to move to Pennsylvania and campaign for the freshman senator. He inspired me with his words and stimulated my heart and mind \u2013 particularly as he wrote about race in a way that spoke deeply to me as fellow mixed-race black American. Over the years, he has repeatedly angered me when he came up short of everything I (naively) dreamed for him. I\u2019ve been most sad that he did not stop the US assault on black and brown people from Gaza to Guant\u00e1namo, the Middle East to the midwest. And yet, part of Obama\u2019s genius as our first black president is that he can provoke so many responses and give us the chance to read him on so many levels of Americana, even in the course of a single speech. Over the past week, Obama did this in three wildly different settings: in black tie, at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner; with his shirt sleeves rolled up while drinking the filtered water of the majority black city Flint, Michigan; and while wearing academic regalia, addressing the black genius of Howard University\u2019s 148th commencement.  The president has been in office for a little less than 400 weeks. In the past seven days, I\u2019ve been especially aware of what it means to have a black president as he moved from a Hilton hotel to a high school to Howard. It gave me a chance to reflect on Obama\u2019s blackness (and mine) and the many ways it does and does not sit in accord with concepts of Americanness, freedom and justice for some. I     Barack Obama listens to comedian Larry Wilmore at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association annual dinner. Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters    \u201cMr President, if I\u2019m going to keep it 100: Yo, Barry, you did it, my nigga. You did it\u201d \u2013 Larry Wilmore, White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner, 30 April 2016   Related: When Larry Wilmore said the N-word to President Obama, I felt black pride | Rebecca Carroll    When I was invited to attend the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner for the first time, I was especially excited to be attending Obama\u2019s last one. My career came up with his presidency. In January 2009, I decided I would earn my living only by writing for a year, vowing to make it work or go hungry trying. I began by covering his inauguration as a freelance story for my suburban hometown paper. I went hungry often over the next nine months, until I landed a staff job.  Seven years later, I was in the room watching the president give his final speech at the dinner. I was thrilled that the president opened his roast about being late because he was \u201crunning on CPT \u2013 which stands for \u2018jokes that white people should not make\u2019\u201d, a clear swipe at Hillary Clinton and Bill de Blasio\u2019s racist (and corny) sketch about \u201ccolored-people time\u201d. He\u2019s talking to me, I thought, egotistically. I loved that this black insider comedy made the powerful white people in the room squirm and, even more delicious, made some of the black folks who have carved out precarious places for themselves within racist structures visibly nervous. I also loved that Larry Wilmore similarly drew boundaries of blackness by calling it \u201cNegro night\u201d, imagining Andrew Jackson calling Ben Carson a \u201cjigaboo\u201d, embracing Obama as \u201cmy nigga\u201d. But I felt queasy when the jokes came about the violence the Obama administration has waged on people of color. When Obama boasted that his possible successor could close Guant\u00e1namo, \u201cbecause Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground\u201d, I flinched. The island prison is a festering site of torture. I winced again when the president praised the recently released Iranian American Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, whom Obama said displayed \u201ccourage as he endured the isolation of an Iranian prison\u201d. When he continued that Rezaian was \u201ca living testament to the very idea of a free press, and a reminder of the rising level of danger, and political intimidation, and physical threats faced by reporters overseas\u201d, I had to think about Chelsea Manning.  Manning has been kept in solitary confinement and was sentenced to 35 years in prison for blowing the whistle on \u201ca 2007 gunsight video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff\u201d, Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh. I felt anxious when Wilmore joked that basketball player Steph Curry and Obama both \u201clike raining down bombs on people from long distances\u201d. How to make sense of a blackness which connected through humor, and which honored the freedom of the press while also punishing someone who exposed the US government killing two Iraqi journalists?  Can Obama\u2019s blackness be compatible with the racialized overseas violence of the office he holds?  Or did Obama expand the boundaries of blackness to include the ability to kill each other with the power of the state?  But if the violence waged upon people of color abroad during Obama\u2019s presidency is obvious, so too has been his reluctance to acknowledge the racial nature of state violence towards people of color within the nation\u2019s borders. II     Obama drinks a glass of water as he delivers remarks at Northwestern high school in Flint, Michigan. Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/EPA    \u201cThere\u2019s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there\u2019s the United States of America\u201d \u2013 Illinois state senator Barack Obama, Democratic National Convention, 27 July 2004   Related: Obama's Flint visit boosted morale \u2013 but it doesn't make the water safe to drink    Most Americans first learned the name Barack Obama when he gave his famous speech at the 2004 Democratic national convention, as a state legislator who would return four years later as the party\u2019s nominee. But one of the reasons I\u2019ve always felt a special affinity for him is because I\u2019d actually heard of \u201cBarry\u201d many years earlier, when he and my late sister Sharron were students at Occidental College in the early 1980s. Sharron came home radicalized about apartheid after the afro-ed Barry gave his first public speech. When he stepped on to the national stage for the first time, in 2004, he seemed to be dreaming \u2013 if not exactly of a post-racial country, then of a nation in which there was no \u201cblack America\u201d. But as has been spelled out in American documents from the constitution to the Ferguson Commission Report \u2013 there is a black America, and not naming it is a violent act of erasure. By the end of Obama\u2019s second term, black America still dies younger, has 1/12 the wealth of white America, and is more likely to be snuffed out by HIV/Aids, subprime mortgages, racial profiling, imprisonment and the police.  Obama went to visit black America when he went to Flint last week \u2013 a 57% chocolate city where the water was poisoned with lead due to the ways Wall Street ethics, austerity politics, and disaster capitalism deem poor black lives expendable.  Unlike at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner, where Obama kept race in the conversation from his opening joke to his mic drop, he barely broached race at Flint Northwestern high school. He used the word \u201cblack\u201d once in passing, and he gestured towards a \u201cculture of neglect\u201d that intersects with otherness: \u201cThey don\u2019t look like my kids exactly, so I don\u2019t have to worry about them.\u201d But Obama never uttered the words \u201crace\u201d or \u201cracism\u201d. Obama skewered the politics and economics which led to the (mostly black) residents of Flint to be poisoned, and he excoriated an anti-government \u201cideology that undervalues the common good\u201d. But he also said he could \u201cnot believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people in Flint\u201d, even as criminal charges have been filed and a state cover-up has come to light. It was frustrating that Obama did not look out at that crowd and explicitly name environmental racism at work. As I recently ethered Bernie Sanders for doing, Obama was more comfortable situating the disaster in terms of general poverty than he was addressing a clear example of anti-blackness. He did not say, as Flint\u2019s native son Michael Moore bluntly did, that \u201cFlint was NOT an infrastructure problem\u201d but \u201ca hate crime and mass poisoning of black and poor people that NEVER would happen if this were Bloomfield Hills or Grosse Pointe or any other white town\u201d. And this reminded me of the most disappointing site of Obama\u2019s presidency: Ferguson, America\u2019s ground zero of racist police terrorism, which he still hasn\u2019t visited. Summering on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in August 2014, Obama\u2019s heart simply did not seem to be in it when he was forced to respond to Mike Brown\u2019s death and the teargassed occupation of American neighborhoods. Perhaps he had been too burned by the blowback to him empathetically saying: \u201cIf I\u2019d had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon Martin\u201d two years earlier. But when Darren Wilson was not indicted, the first black president seemed to have checked out. His usual soaring rhetoric gave way to stammering words, and his body language was uncomfortable.  Obama was feisty and spirited addressing Flint \u2013 but he was also comparing that mostly black population to Appalachia, framing the crisis as a more racially neutral story of de-industrialization. It was disappointing. III     Obama is awarded an honorary doctor of science degree, before speaking at Howard University in Washington. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP    \u201cBe confident in your blackness ... there\u2019s no one way to be black. Take it from somebody who\u2019s seen both sides of debate about whether I\u2019m black enough ... There\u2019s no straitjacket, there\u2019s no constraints, there\u2019s no litmus test for authenticity ... You can create your own style, set your own standard of beauty, embrace your own sexuality ... And because you\u2019re a black person doing whatever it is that you\u2019re doing, that makes it a black thing\u201d \u2013 President Barack Obama, Howard University, 7 May 2016   Related: #ThanksObama: president's greatest legacy may be Trumping of the GOP    If Obama was speaking beneath the white gaze at the nerd prom, and stunting for a broader, whiter audience beyond Flint, he did not have to do any of this when he spoke at Howard. There, on hand to receive an honorary doctorate of science, Dr Obama spoke in a black space. And there, throughout much of his speech, he was as genuine and thrilling on race as he\u2019s ever been \u2013 at moments as poetically beautiful as when he broke into Amazing Grace when giving Clementa Pinckney\u2019s eulogy in Charleston. He spoke to the \u201cBuffalo\u201d with references only those blackademics would get. He preached about the black genius of Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry and Prince. He didn\u2019t skirt around racism or sexism, either. (\u201cTubman may be going on the 20, but a black woman working full-time still earns just 66% of what a white man gets paid.\u201d) He countered Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201csuper-predator\u201d ideology by saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t just lock up a low-level dealer without asking why this boy, barely out of childhood, felt he had no other options. He even said aloud that the \u201coverall unemployment rate is 5%, but the black unemployment rate is almost 9%.\u201d (I wish he\u2019d acknowledged that if you factor in all the people in prison, the African American male unemployment is actually closer to 19%.)  Still, this is it, I thought. He\u2019s complicated, but this is as great as American politics will ever get. There will never be anyone in the Oval Office to meditate upon nuanced notions of blackness and beauty and truth and Americanness of his likes ever again. But then the respectability politics started creep in, and Obama brought the white gaze right into the Black Mecca. He started to tell the grads:  We must expand our moral imaginations to understand and empathize with all people who are struggling, not just black folks who are struggling \u2013 the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender person and yes, the middle-aged white guy who you may think has all the advantages, but over the last several decades has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change, and feels powerless to stop it. You got to get in his head, too.  He started to lose me there. Why did the nation\u2019s first black president feel the need to equate the transgender person who can\u2019t use the bathroom in North Carolina, and the unfairly maligned immigrant with that \u201cmiddle-aged white guy\u201d?  Who feels so threatened by the \u201ccultural\u201d change of living under a black president and living under conditions a little more like those black Americans have endured for hundreds of years that he\u2019s likely voting for Donald Trump?  Who isn\u2019t losing all of his white privilege, because he still has a black president telling black grads to get in his head?  Obama also said when it comes to protesting, \u201cdon\u2019t try to shut folks out \u2013 no matter how much you might disagree with them\u201d and to just \u201clet them talk\u201d. And how much should we let them talk, Mr President? Should we wait until someone is killed at a Trump rally?  Or should we wait until his emboldened voters start killing people they think are Muslim or Mexican in the street? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t challenge them,\u201d Obama added, paradoxically. He praised activist Brittany Packnett because she came to the White House and rolled up \u201cher sleeves and sat at the same table with big city police chiefs and prosecutors\u201d, but he chastised the activists who are still shouting and putting their bodies on the line in the streets to protest the unabated killing of black life by police. It was a strange move to make the day after news leaked that his administration is preparing to designate the Stonewall Inn a national landmark \u2013 in commemoration of a riot against police violence.  He also threw serious shade at the gathered young people by saying his failures with Congress were their fault because of low youth turnout. \u201cYou don\u2019t have excuses\u201d not to vote, he exhorted. But the first black president erased a whole lot of franchise politics when he said voters \u201cdon\u2019t have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar or bubbles on a bar of soap to register to vote\u201d. True, but those suppressive tactics have been replaced by birth certificate rules and incarceration records. While you might not \u201chave to risk your life to cast a ballot\u201d, if voters have to stand on a line for five hours they may just risk their financial life or \u2013 if their babysitter has to leave before they get home \u2013 their child\u2019s life. And, despite these challenges, the president sounded like the Black Lives Matter movement hasn\u2019t still had really amazing local electoral successes. (It has in his hometown, actually).  By the end of his speech, Obama had evoked both Ta-Nehisi Coates and James Baldwin for bootstrap narratives \u2013 you, too, could write Black Panther and Between the World and Me! \u2013 and I was annoyed. He was telling the young people to suck it up, pull themselves up, and compromise.  How could I be so inspired by Obama one minute, and so angry the next?  Had I been a fool to think that the having a black face as the face of American empire would make things different over the past seven years \u2013 as deportations, drone strikes and police killings mounted?  Was I projecting my own ambivalence about my career being built on writing about black death, and my anxieties about if I was doing enough to counter racism, on to the president?  Obama said Howard was \u201ca centerpiece of African American intellectual life and a central part of our larger American story\u201d. The same can be said of him. In his presidency, the capaciousness of blackness has expanded so much that the meanings of what blackness and Americanness are have shifted enormously. The change is so tectonic that we simply will not understand its true magnitude until future historians consider it. But in the present, it should be no surprise to me that Obama\u2019s Howard speech \u2013 like his past week \u2013 left me annoyed, angry, bemused, excited, inspired, in awe, and utterly fascinated. After all, I usually have this mix of feelings about the United States of America.  When Obama said to \u201cbe confident in your blackness\u201d, I thought that to me, blackness means love \u2013 the love of others who live in blackness, the love of those who rebel in black queerness, the love of my father, of Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved, of Coltrane\u2019s A Love Supreme. Seven years on, it\u2019s hard to reconcile Obama with love; and yet he\u2019s still the first president I have known to say: \u201cI love you back\u201d. Perhaps, then, the love is in the wrestling he makes me do. For the next few months, I will continue to appreciate each week Obama forces me to wrestle intellectually and emotionally with unanswerable questions of American power and black identity.  And when he is gone, I will miss the wrestling terribly.",
