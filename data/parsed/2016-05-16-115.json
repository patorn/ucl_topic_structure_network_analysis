  "body": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blog. Here\u2019s a roundup of your comments and photos from last week, with lots of poetry \u2013 from Mary Oliver\u2019s approachable words to Emily Dickinson\u2019s obsession with gardens \u2013, a \u201cbrilliantly\u201d funny book about race in America, and readers forgetting what they\u2019ve read. booksnourishcarole praised the poetry of Mary Oliver:   Mary Oliver is my favorite poet in the spring, when everything comes alive again and awes us with the Earth\u2019s beauty and bounty. Her poetry is accessible and always makes me more alert to my surroundings and I see with more appreciative eyes. \u201cStill, what I want in my life / is to be willing / to be dazzled \u2013 to cast aside the weight of facts / and maybe even / to float a little / above this difficult world. / I want to believe I am looking / into the white fire of a great mystery.\u201d (excerpt from The Ponds)       [I can\u2019t help but link to this beautiful piece from Brain Pickings on Oliver, her soulmate \u2013 the photographer Molly Malone Cook \u2013 and what attention really means. If you haven\u2019t seen it or don\u2019t know much about Oliver, you will probably enjoy this discovery.]  SydneyH has finished The Europeans by Henry James:   ... which is my new favourite among the texts of his that I\u2019ve read, and is certainly the most readable. For me, the first page alone is worth more than all of The Ambassadors combined. It\u2019s essentially what I had been looking for in James\u2019s work, something with the wit and intelligence of What Maisie Knew, without compromising its appeal with misty abstractions. The plot is essentially about the incestuous romances of an aristocratic American family when two European cousins come to stay, back in a time when that was an unremarkable occurrence. It sounds innocuous, but it\u2019s a sharp satire. I\u2019m now leaning towards James\u2019s shorter and earlier works, so I\u2019ll add The Spoils of Poynton to my list.  fingerlakeswanderer recommended Mat Johnson\u2019s \u201cbrilliantly funny and just plain brilliant\u201d novel, Loving Day:   ... narrated by a \u201cmixed-race\u201d man who discovers that he has an 17-year old \u201cwhite\u201d daughter. For those who don\u2019t want to read a serious book that deals with race in America \u2013 how about if that serious book made you laugh your a## off? Johnson\u2019s discussions about race, and gender, and self-identity are sharp and funny, the very best kind of satire that slices you open while you\u2019re busy guffawing. He\u2019s a hell of a writer.  Yosserian has started The Spectator Bird by Wallace Stegner \u2013 which prompted a question for other readers:   About twenty pages in, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu struck, and I realized I must have read this before \u2026 a certain scene brought back a strong mental image of the moment I had at the time of first reading it. I\u2019m now about the third the way through, I still cannot remember the outcome of the novel. I got me to thinking about how I remember novels. Some people I know can reel of the entire narrative of books, while I struggle to be articulate, but nonetheless have a strong set of mental images and somewhat ineffable emotions feelings. I have the same thing looking back over my life. Some people can spin long yarns about past experiences, and again I\u2019m completely inarticulate. Anyway, I just wondered about the differing way people remember books they have read.  Interesting links about books and reading  Uninvent This: a New Yorker series in which writers \u2013 from Charlie Brooker to Carrie Brownstein \u2013 talk about the one thing they wish hadn\u2019t been invented.  The Lost Gardens of Emily Dickinson: on the poet\u2019s adoration of the plant kingdom, and how it impacted her life and work. In the New York Times.  Why I quit being a writer: Jaime Clarke on saying goodbye to the writing life, in Literary Hub.  How Books Became the Language My Father and I Found Together: \u201cIn a relationship where communication doesn\u2019t come easily, literature has become our shared vernacular,\u201d by David L Ulin for Buzzfeed.  When Your Memoir Needs Less of You: \u201cIt feels reassuring to write everything you remember, how it all felt. But to write well sometimes involves rejecting reassurance.\u201d By Lucas Mann for Catapult.  Weeding the Worst Library Books: \u201cOn their blog Awful Library Books, two librarians highlight books that seem to them so self-evidently ridiculous that weeding is the only possible recourse.\u201d In the New Yorker.
