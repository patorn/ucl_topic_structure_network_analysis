  "body": "Your editorial (Imagine no religion \u2013 it\u2019s not so easy if you try, 28 May) exposes the problem of the conflation of morality with religion. There is considerable opposition from the Department for Education to any inclusion of non-religious world views in the school curriculum, yet there is good evidence that young people are even more likely to have \u201cno religion\u201d than their parents. It is deeply irresponsible of ministers to ignore the facts about religious decline and to risk moral education being diluted. The response of humanists, like myself, has been to volunteer to visit schools to talk to students about humanist values, the long history of their development, and their relevance to contemporary moral issues. The British Humanist Association has just launched its new website, Understanding Humanism, with extensive resources for teachers to plan and deliver classes and an online form to request a school volunteer visit. My own experience of school visits has been that students are very receptive to a discussion of secular ethics and many are pleased to find that their own views are validated by humanist ideals.Richard GilyeadSaffron Walden, Essex \u2022 Granted we need \u201ca sense of global solidarity ... and a vision of humanity that transcends narrow self-interest\u201d. You ask: \u201cIf Christianity no longer can supply that, what will?\u201d Answer: a clear understanding of the use of moral language. Just as humanity needs a common language to convey factual information, it also needs a language to promote the common interest of its members in their personal fulfilment (Aristotle\u2019s \u201cwell-being\u201d). Just as convention fixes the truth conditions of factual statements, it settles the valid arguments to support moral judgments \u2013 and in both cases, the conventions are flexible to meet the changing needs of society. This is how moral questions are actually discussed (eg in editorials) \u2013 isn\u2019t it time we accepted it as such, instead of hankering for \u201ca set of religious stories and rituals\u201d alleged to \u201cjustify\u201d the arguments in terms of priestly pronouncements about the will of some unknowable person, obedience to whom will be rewarded in some unimaginable afterlife? Alan BaileyLondon \u2022 Your leader\u2019s question, \u201cIf Christianity no longer can supply global solidarity, what will?\u201d certainly woke me up from drowsy in-bed perusal of the papers. I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 the Guardian coming from such a reactionary position? Is it so hard to see that humans have values whether they believe in the supernatural or not? That the ideas at the heart of liberal faith \u2013 love, compassion and human rights \u2013 are ones humanity has developed in the same way humanity developed ideas of God. If we created it all, and we and our ideas evolve, then why shouldn\u2019t we choose to keep the important stuff and discard the packaging? There is a philosophy which has grown up within and alongside religion from the beginning and that is humanism. Come on in: you will find humanists full of wonder, full of spirituality, if by that you mean a sense of connectivity with things greater than themselves, and morally engaged with the world.Hester BrownLondon \u2022 The assertion that human rights \u201carose out of Christianity\u201d is unsustainable. Human rights were variously encoded long before Christianity and beyond Europe, for example, by Babylonian King Hammurabi 2,000 years before, and in the 6th century BCE by the Charter of Cyrus. Around the same time in China, Confucius urged respect for the intrinsic value and moral force of all people and articulated the Golden Rule. In the 4th century BCE, the Confucian Mencius declared that \u201cthe individual is of infinite value, institutions and conventions come next, and the person of the ruler is of least significance\u201d. Christianity added only dogma, guilt and hellfire to Judaism\u2019s version of the Golden Rule (Leviticus 19:34), and bound human worth to God and the church. Human beings have struggled for human rights for as long as they have existed and in all parts of the planet: perhaps we should just have more faith in ourselves?Peter McKennaLiverpool \u2022 Alison Leonard (Letters, 24 May) says: \u201cIt\u2019s fine that we\u2019re living without ancient texts as our moral guides\u201d, but then asks \u201chow we can retrieve the concept of \u2018the common good\u2019?\u201d. The irony, of course, is that the concept of the common good is deeply, although no doubt not exclusively, grounded in the thinking of people who do look to \u201cancient texts\u201d for (part of) their moral guidance. At their the best, the Christian churches have spent a lot of time over the past 2,000 years having the discussions about the organisation and maintenance of a good community for which Ms Leonard calls. One need not accept all the claims of religion to recognise that this gives us a resource upon which we can continue to draw, and that the churches (and other faiths) can and should be part of our ongoing thinking.Andrew ConnellCardiff \u2022 Giles Fraser (The world is getting more religious, 27 May) imagines that secularism is a European conceit unvalued by the world\u2019s poor. Yet the World Values Survey shows that the world\u2019s least religious countries are in East Asia not Europe. Europeans are just catching up with the Eastern Enlightenment.Professor Alastair BonnettNewcastle University  \u2022 Giles Fraser\u2019s analysis rings true, both politically and economically, from the perspective of liberation theologies, but I would suggest the huge decline in western Christianity has a much simpler root cause: the perceived claims of what people see as orthodox belief are, literally, incredible to the modern mind. And I think that includes quite a few of the tiny percentage of the population which still goes to church, who often struggle to find a safe space where faith\u2019s partner, true doubt, can be honestly explored.Fr Alec MitchellManchester \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
