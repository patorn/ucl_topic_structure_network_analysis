  "body": "Going up Candy stripe straws Totally Demna Balenciaga. The fashion touch for every summer party cocktail. Harmony Korine From Kids to Rihanna. Impeccable taste, tbh. Bunney x Converse As beautiful as it is possible for a white trainer to be. Jacques Cousteau Totally new Gucci. Totally the way all men should dress now. Not the scuba suit: see the red hat, gold specs and chambray shirt. Serena Williams Forget James Blake and Jack White, a dancing Serena\u00a0Williams is the best guest star in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade audio-visual feast. The Henley Regatta look Topshop Unique and new brand La Ligne are both doing the chunky vertical stripes. We\u2019re into it. Going down The sweep back See Damian Lewis and Henry from Marcella. Men, step away from the hair product. Skinny jeans If we\u2019ve said it once, we\u2019ve said it a thousand times: these are over. New evidence? The Vetements jeans and 80s numbers in\u00a0Everybody Wants Some!! Rita Ora in the Gucci outfit Just not as good as Bey. Sorry, love. Kylie\u2019s perm Last time we checked, it wasn\u2019t 1988. This is a hair don\u2019t. Coachella Even Alexa Chung abstained this year. We\u2019re calling the death knell of the official hipster\u00a0festival. Watches Yeah, there\u2019s the Apple Watch, but what with sleeves coming to thumb level, anything round the wrist is a tricky proposition right now. Revert to telling the time on your phone.",
